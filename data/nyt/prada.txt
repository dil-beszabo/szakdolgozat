Full text: With the right actor, ambivalence can be enticing. If you can't tell whether or not someone wants something, you lean forward. There's suspense.
Ambivalence is part of the allure when it comes to Harris Dickinson, the British actor who first broke out with the 2017 indie "Beach Rats," in which he played a sexually confused Brooklyn teenager. You were never quite certain what the character wanted and maybe he didn't know, either. But because of that, and because Dickinson is the type of actor to never overplay his hand, even watching him do something small had you on tenterhooks.
Now 28, Dickinson has found the ideal vehicle for his stock in trade. In the new film "Babygirl," he plays Samuel, an intern caught up in a risky affair with his married boss, Romy (Nicole Kidman). Their sexual chemistry is based on a dominant/submissive dynamic, though who has the most power is unclear: Romy has dominion over him in the workplace but in the bedroom, Samuel calls the shots.
Or at least, he's supposed to. Part of the fun of "Babygirl" is that Samuel is not some steely sexual manipulator out of "Fifty Shades of Grey": This wayward young man is making it up as he goes along. After commanding Romy to get on her knees, he might second-guess himself and apologize to her. Even Samuel's more decisive commands can be a bit loopy: At a crowded bar, he orders a tall glass of milk and instructs Romy to drink it. Milk? Well, I guess there are no bad ideas when you're brainstorming.
Precisely because Samuel is tough to pin down -- and because, when he's revved up, he might try to pin you down -- the performance is beguiling and sexy, the sort of star turn that could become the cornerstone of a career. Dickinson has been in movies that popped, like "Triangle of Sadness" and "The Iron Claw," but that's not the same thing as popping yourself. "Babygirl" is likely to change that: After its August premiere at the Venice Film Festival made Dickinson the most lusted-after man on the Lido, Vulture ran an article musing that the movie had given Dickinson "something invaluable for a young actor," a star image.
A few months ago, figuring that Dickinson would be eager to capitalize on his new heat, I asked his reps how soon the London-based actor would be coming to America to do press. The answer I got back was surprising: He wouldn't be, as he was so deep into postproduction on his feature directorial debut that all "Babygirl"-related appearances would have to wait until the end of the year.
Was he really willing to let his big breakout moment pass without months of interviews and photo shoots? I couldn't tell whether he really wanted this or not but I was, at least, leaning forward.
Then cooler heads prevailed. In mid-October, Dickinson was dislodged from the editing room and spirited to Los Angeles for a whirlwind weekend that involved "Babygirl" screenings, a starry, schmoozy gala at the Academy Museum, and lunch with The New York Times. Yes, ambivalence can be enticing. But in Hollywood, you can only play hard to get for so long.
ON THE DAY I met Dickinson at a Beverly Hills hotel restaurant, he was clad in a Spice Girls T-shirt and track shorts, marveling at the summery temperatures in Los Angeles well into the fall. Then again, he'd been spending most of his daylight hours inside, toiling away on the movie he had directed over the summer, which has the working title "Limousine Dreams."
"It was hard to step away from something like that because it's so all-encompassing," he said of the film, which follows a young drifter who tries to reassimilate into London society. It's the sort of leading role you might expect Dickinson to have written for himself, but he was certain he didn't want to star in it and cast the actor Frank Dillane instead.
"The thing with acting that I find is that there's many other things that get wrapped up in it, like vanity and self-confidence and insecurities," he said. "With directing, that is also the case, but at least you have a team of people to lean on and support your vision. Whereas with acting, you're on your own."
Other actors have a tendency to preen for journalists but over lunch, I sensed that Dickinson was constitutionally incapable of that, preferring to stay within his own energy instead of endeavoring to impress. He was low-key in a regular-person kind of way, which perhaps explains why he is capable of much more naturalistic performances than many British actors his age.
In fact, aside from the good looks that got him cast as a model in "Triangle of Sadness" and earned him a Prada ambassadorship in real life, there was almost nothing about Dickinson's manner that suggested you were talking to a movie star. I mean that, generally, as a compliment: Nothing feels performative about him except for the very thing he does for a living.
"He doesn't show his hunger," said the "Babygirl" director Halina Reijn, who described Dickinson's sometimes complicated relationship with his career: "He wants to act, but it's almost as if he has a love/hate relationship with it."
In fact, Dickinson hasn't acted since he wrapped "Babygirl" in January. "It's been really nice, actually," he said. "Acting is neurotic, always. I say that with great love for the neurosis, with great enthusiasm for that. But yeah, it's complicated."
What he finds most unnerving is when he taps deeply into his own psyche for a character, that private, ineffable thing is captured forever on film. "That's a scary prospect, to put that out there," he said. "Even if no one sees it, it's still infinitely in the cinematic pool."
Still, once he commits to something, he expects to offer up both body and soul.
"I'm pretty open and willing, maybe sometimes to my detriment," he said. "I feel I'm too open sometimes and it causes me issues."
For Reijn, who started as an actor before seguing into directing, Dickinson's reticence is all too relatable. "Acting is like being an animal without a fur, being a person without a skin," she said. "The more honest you are within artificial circumstances, the more exciting it gets, but to be that honest is pretty intense."
And when you snap out of your performance and realize what you've shown people, it can all feel a little mortifying. Reijn put it bluntly: "We're all standing around them in North Face jackets, eating a piece of pizza, saying, 'Crawl on the ground, cry, undress,' you know what I mean?"
When Reijn first pursued Dickinson for "Babygirl," he had some hesitations. "There's many films that have come before in this world that, to be frank, have been done badly," he said. "And I was not scared of Halina doing that, but scared of my own ability."
What sold him is that she wanted to portray the scaffolding behind the dom/sub dynamic. Any time he felt blockage in a scene, Reijn said the way through ought to be tapping into his character's embarrassment: "She would be like, 'This is all a performance, and you have to break the facade. You have to laugh."'
Dickinson was also compelled by Samuel's confusion, which he saw as emblematic of his generation. "We are going back to the idea of what it means to be a man nowadays in an ever-changing society," Dickinson said. In one quiet moment together, Samuel even asks Romy whether she thinks he's a bad person.
"He's scared of his own darkness," Dickinson said. "There's a really dangerous thing going on with lonely, angry young men that are being ignored or pushed aside, and as a result, they're becoming really toxic versions of themselves."
Reijn concurred. "It's obvious that men are confused, and I wanted that in the movie," she said. "He's someone you could see is struggling with, 'What do you expect from me? Who am I allowed to be?"'
Again, Dickinson's ambivalence came in handy. Even in the most explicit moments with Romy, like a fraught hotel-room encounter that ends with her on all fours, Samuel flicks in and out of character: He's playacting masculinity, even though he still isn't sure yet what it means to be a man.
"It almost looks like it's improvised," Reijn said, "but Harris uses his own shame in the scene, which I think is incredible."
Dickinson told me he's proud of what he put into the movie, even if certain moments felt so vulnerable that they become awkward for him to watch. One such scene is the charming highlight of "Babygirl," in which Samuel dances shirtless to George Michael's "Father Figure" for a bemused Romy. It's sexy and silly, somewhere between peacocking and mating dance, and both times he filmed it, Dickinson just did what came naturally.
"Someone asked me yesterday how long it took to choreograph," he said. "I was like, are you joking?" That was all him. Even the parts he wouldn't normally want you to see.
MANY OF THE actors in Dickinson's peer group can barely conceal their ambition. That isn't necessarily a bad thing: Hunger can be a charismatic part of a star persona. But Dickinson's ambition is more elusive, or at least more closely kept.
"I'm quietly competitive," he admitted. "In many ways, British people particularly love to be humble and so I lead with that, of course, out of politeness. But deep down, no, I have big ambitions."
As a young man growing up in a suburb of East London, Dickinson always had an affinity for filmmaking: He used to round up friends to shoot a weekly sketch show on his flip cam, and when he was 15, he applied to his local council for a financial grant to make a short film. Still, as the son of a social worker and a hairdresser, he didn't see a viable path to Hollywood.
"I thought maybe I was foolish for choosing the arts or the entertainment industry, such a frivolous, unattainable thing," he said. "What on earth was I doing even trying to enter that?"
Instead, Dickinson spent most of his teenage years in the Royal Marines Cadets, expecting to enlist upon graduation. The Marines at least offered a realistic option that could prove structure and a sense of masculinity.
"We're all looking for our community, and I was desperately searching for it," he said. "I think a lot of it was an element of performance, trying to be this other person, trying to cosplay as a more dangerous guy. It's what we all do: We put on these fronts."
In a way, that involved acting, too. So did the moments when the medical team needed training and his fellow cadets would prod Dickinson to play a wounded soldier: "They knew I was just a theater kid in the Marines. I couldn't escape the fate, ultimately."
An acting teacher further encouraged Dickinson to pursue performance, and though he was leery -- "I wanted definitives, I didn't want maybes" -- he eventually decided to go for it. After years of fruitless auditions and frustrating pilot seasons that came to naught, he finally booked "Beach Rats," then found his way to bigger productions, like the sequel to "Maleficent" and "Where the Crawdads Sing." Said Dickinson, "I've ended up in this mad world and I'm like, 'Yeah, this is obviously my tribe."'
So even though acting can be neurotic, Dickinson isn't about to turn his back on it just as his career begins to heat up. His most high-profile gig yet may be the one up next: It's rumored that he will star in a forthcoming quartet of movies about the Beatles that will be directed by Sam Mendes. Dickinson would play John Lennon alongside the likes of Paul Mescal as Paul McCartney.
Perhaps that's fitting, since "Babygirl" has already sparked feelings akin to Beatlemania. Reijn recalled that after one recent screening, she was mobbed in the bathroom by new and ardent fans of the actor: "The women were almost attacking me about him, asking, 'What is he like?"' (When I asked Kidman about Dickinson, even she inhaled and cooed, "Isn't he darling?")
Knowing that early audiences have been ardent, is Dickinson prepared for "Babygirl" to change the way people see him?
"I don't know," he told me, shrugging. "I'm just doing my job, man. I just want people to enjoy it. Whatever happens, it's beyond my control."
Doesn't he care at all about how he's perceived? Dickinson laughed.
"No, come on babe," he said. "Why would I? We're all going to die."

How Airlines Choose Movies: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: Sure, everyone likes "Barbie." But who knew that "Cats" would be a hit at 35,000 feet?
On your long-haul trip home for the holidays, you will scrunch yourself into a too-narrow seat, fasten your seatbelt and probably turn on the screen in front of you.
At least half and sometimes as many as eight in 10 customers use that entertainment system, executives from the major domestic airlines say. And the top option, said Dominic Green, the director of in-flight entertainment at United, is movies.
"The people who aren't engaging are basically on redeye flights coming back from Las Vegas or they are children under 2," said Ekrem Dimbiloglu, a managing director for customer experience at Delta.
Delta has 165,000 screens on 840 jets. United has 500 planes equipped with seat-back screens and more are being added every day. That means that airlines, as Green likes to say, are some of the largest "cinemas in the sky."
But who determines what you get to see while stuck in a metal tube at 35,000 feet? And how do they choose? We talked to the people in charge to find out.
Who decides which movies are available?
Airlines mostly have teams that help curate the entertainment. At Southwest, Kennedy Wilson is, as she put it, "a team of one." Dimbiloglu leads a team of four at Delta, some of whom attend film festivals. Green's team has quadrupled in recent years from two to eight.
The airlines also partner with content service providers -- akin to middlemen -- that offer recommendations and they sometimes seek additional help when putting together a collection for, say, or Hispanic Heritage Month, or trying to program for an international flight.
On a cross-country trip in October, Delta offered a Halloween collection that included "Beetlejuice" and "The Conjuring." There was also a category called Cozy Family Fall that featured "Coco" and "Remember the Titans."
Green said United worked with more than 100 content providers to fill out its roster of movies, TV series, music and podcasts. American Airlines carries more than 1,500 titles overall and an average of 500 movies, said Kim Cisek, the vice president of customer experience.
How are the movies selected?
The airlines say they are data-driven. They can see which movies we are watching and how long we are watching them for.
Some airlines also track how shows are performing on external streaming platforms that viewers use at home and consider how titles are being received in different markets and among particular demographics. Cisek said American Airlines gathers insights from flight attendants, too.
And customers famously love giving feedback. Many fill out satisfaction surveys, and more than a few feel compelled to tweet or write in with a specific request -- or complaint.
But data cannot tell you everything. Only humans know that "Inside Out" and "Inside Out 2" are very different movies. Or that tennis feels kind of hot right now. (See "Challengers.")
Green said his team and their colleagues who run social media noted the buzz around a forthcoming "Devil Wears Prada" sequel. So they put the original "Devil Wears Prada" on board, even though it is more than 20 years old, and it performed well.
"Art and science," Green said.
How often do the movies change?
Executives say they rotate and evaluate movies regularly to keep their offerings fresh. For example, American Airlines adds roughly 200 titles every month.
Is it just me, or are there more niche categories now?
As the number of offerings has ballooned into the hundreds, airlines have increasingly sought to categorize them. They sometimes lean on internal employee resource groups to help curate selections for Black History Month and International Women's Day. Or, as was the case at Southwest, they create a Ryan Reynolds category because they have a lot of Ryan Reynolds movies and "that's just fun," Wilson said.
Some airlines are getting even more personalized. United tracks usage and viewership (responsibly, it says) and considers the information and preferences customers share in their profiles. "If they tell us they're really into action movies," Green said, "we can take them straight into that kind of action movie collection."
Delta has recently begun rolling out a way to sync up its in-flight entrainment system with customers' airline membership accounts so that they can interact with the system like they would with Netflix. Many customers can now restart a movie right where they left off on their last trip and get smarter recommendations based on what they have already watched. "We're trying to bring that living room experience to you in the air," Dimbiloglu said.
At least five generations are flying in this moment, Cisek said. "So it's really important that we have something for everyone."
Does 'Oppenheimer' cost the same as 'Sleepless in Seattle?'
Definitely not. (Though none of the airline representatives would say how much they spend on movies or specify how much different titles cost.)
Airlines work with studios and content service providers to procure the movies they want to show. But the budget is not unlimited, and curation teams must decide what will give them the best bang for their buck. For instance, Southwest passed on "Top Gun: Maverick," Wilson said, even though she believed it would be popular.
Airlines also must contend with licensing windows. It will be months before "Wicked," in theaters now, can be shown on planes. And once they get it, they may have it for only six months or a year at a time.
What types of movies do people like to watch?
"The golden rule is there is no kind of golden rule," Green said.
But airline executives have learned a thing or two about what customers seem to like.
Nostalgic comfort and comedy
Dimbiloglu estimated that 40 percent of Delta's customers are millennials, and many of them seem interested in shows that took off when they were growing up. "Curb Your Enthusiasm," "The Office" and "Friends" are television series, not movies, but they perform really well on Delta, he said.
"The Office" is also popular on American Airlines, Cisek said, as is "Abbott Elementary." She highlighted comedy series as especially winning. "Customers are looking for ways to have an enjoyable flight and just kind of turn off," she said.
The 'airline movie'
Multiple executives independently pointed to the same movie that they said had been popular among customers for years: "Crazy Rich Asians." Those that removed the title said they received complaints.
"It's an airline movie," Dimbiloglu said. "A positive, uplifting movie that has a lot of travel associated with it, that has adventure associated with it and that puts you in a good mood."
Like the characters in a good airline movie, he said, most of the people on a plane are going somewhere and want to be happy when they get there.
The 'unicorn'
"There's always a unicorn," Wilson said, "one movie that you're like, 'Oh, sure, we'll put it on board," and to everyone's surprise, "it just astronomically performs."
For her, the best example of a unicorn was "Cats." People know the musical, she said, and the movie was heavily advertised before it was released in 2019. But the film was skewered after audiences actually got to see it and it flopped at the box office.
Nonetheless, "Cats" turned out to be one of Southwest's top performing movies. "House of Gucci" stole that title soon after.
It all sort of makes sense to Wilson. Time in the air is burden-free, she said, and those "found hours" let you try something new or sneak in something you've secretly wanted to watch.
Delta executives were hardly surprised that "Barbie" found a wide audience. But when they looked closer, they saw something unexpected: Male business travelers were among its highest viewers.
"There's no laws. Watching a movie in-flight, you're already in a tube," Wilson said. "You're already going to be in there for a certain amount of time. So they see a movie that they wouldn't buy a ticket for."

Vuitton. Chanel. Who Cares?: [Op-Ed]

Full text: The holiday shopping season is hitting its apex. And do you know what I, a longtime fashion editor, will not be buying my loved ones this year? Big-name luxury fashion. I'd sooner set my eyebrows on fire.
Why am I betraying the industry to which I've dedicated the better part of the past 20 years of my life, you might wonder? Let me tell you a story.
When, for the fall 2023 season, Marc Jacobs reissued the runway-show version of his Kiki boots -- a sought-after, supple-leather style that I'd been lusting after since their 2016 debut -- I found a way to squeeze them into my budget. I'd had a tumultuous few months, and I figured I'd treat myself to something I'd treasure forever. Something that would last.
They did not. The right heel cap fell off after a handful of wears, revealing a flimsy plastic cavern. I got it replaced, only to have a four-inch platform base snap off like a rotting tree limb days later. Timber! Two passers-by heaved me up, and I limped home, barefoot. In February, I demanded a refund, which I promptly put toward much-needed physical therapy.
My experience sums up everything that's gone wrong with what once served as semiotic shorthand for the good life. In recent years, luxury of all kinds has become obscenely, disgracefully, inconceivably costly. And the price hikes we've seen are steeper than what inflation would dictate. What's worse? As costs climb, quality hasn't. In fact, it's largely declined.
"Luxury is in chaos," said Gill Linton, a fashion and marketing expert and a co-founder of the luxury vintage platform Byronesque.
I'd go a step further. Luxury is in a death spiral. After a decade of nearly unfettered growth, the sector is bombing across the globe. Analysts point to less-affluent buyers reining in their spending and slowing demand in China. I believe there's another culprit: a growing realization that many luxury houses have broken the principles that made them so successful. These hoity-toity brands, which cheapened their essence and eviscerated their desirability with down-market celebrity partnerships, licensing deals and influencer advertising, have no one to blame but themselves.
This started at the source of so many modern woes: social media. For those not glued to TikTok or "The Kardashians," social media, helped along by reality TV, has instigated a frenetic game of one-upmanship in which top social-media content makers aim to project wealth while outdoing themselves and their competition. This means flaunting luxury goods in posts that are then spread widely by algorithms. Kyle Richards, a cast member of "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills," has become infamous for hitting the gym with a difficult-to-get Hermès Birkin bag -- which costs anywhere from five figures to hundreds of thousands of dollars -- dangling from her arm.
At the same time, the rich were getting richer -- and more people were joining them. According to Swiss bank UBS, there were 7.64 million millionaires in the United States in 2000. By 2023, we saw that number nearly triple.
For those who aren't comfortably in the millionaire class, technology offers a solution. The exploding popularity of financing apps such as Klarna and Afterpay -- online lending services that allow users to break payments up into installments -- has ushered in a whole new era of buy now, pay later. It's stigma-free layaway for nearly any item. Nobody has to know, and you get the product upfront.
Suddenly, brands accustomed to catering to a select few found themselves pursued by a surfeit of less discerning customers -- some literally children -- seeking a status boost for their social media profiles. Meanwhile, the platforms continue to both stoke class anxieties and offer a seemingly unlimited amount of data on what to want next. Confronted by hordes, companies tried preserving their images the one way they knew how: jacking up prices. In doing so, they followed the longstanding Veblen goods principle. Derived from the economist Thorstein Veblen's "The Theory of the Leisure Class," written in 1899, it states that demand for luxury goods will actually increase as their prices increase, because such hikes thin the herds and make scarce goods that much more desirable.
Which prices have skyrocketed? The better question is which haven't.
From October 2019 to April 2024, the cost of Prada's popular Galleria Saffiano bag increased 111 percent. In the same period, the cost of Louis Vuitton's canvas Speedy bag doubled, and Gucci's Marmont small matelassé shoulder bag went up by 75 percent. Chanel is particularly notorious: Its iconic medium 2.55 leather flap bag, which cost $ 5,800 in 2019, will now set you back $ 10,800 -- and is increasingly the subject of quality complaints.
What about that perfect exotic backdrop to show off your new goods? A thousand bucks for a night in a normal hotel room, once unheard-of, is surprisingly common. Rooms at the sought-after Amangiri resort in Utah started at around $ 1,800 a night in 2018. Now they start at $ 3,509. Jaclyn Sienna India, the founder of a travel and lifestyle company that caters to individuals and families with a minimum net worth of $ 100 million, notes that the prix fixe menu at the exclusive Ibiza restaurant Sublimotion was about $ 1,675 a head in 2022. Today, she said, it's $ 2,380.
Under the Veblen goods principle, shoppers should view luxury brands' higher prices as a sign that the goods are precious and hard to obtain. The problem is that neither of those is the case.
Luxury has become nearly ubiquitous. Open Instagram, and everyone has a Louis Vuitton Speedy or a Chanel Boy Bag or some other instantly recognizable four-figure-plus purse from a mainstream luxury label. Some of that comes from the rise of resale (people disposing of their used luxury wares, usually at deep discounts) or dupes (similar-looking copies that trade for far less). And a growing number are superfakes -- highly convincing counterfeits that seemingly offer similar quality for a fraction of the cost.
On top of all of this, some luxury purveyors also began expanding their product categories and selling overstock via off-price outlets. Boutiques that were once decadent salons offering fittings to clients while they sipped champagne are now tourist destinations for the rich and the upper middle class, trading in wallets and key chains, which, despite their comical price tags, are among the cheapest options. We are mere minutes away from a Chanel- and Gucci-packed outlet store popping up in a midtier strip mall near you.
For a while, it worked. After the pandemic, newly minted millionaires were eager to spend and show off. The Chanels and Vuittons jacked up prices "so the 'wrong' people stop buying," said Erez Yoeli, a research scientist at M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Management. But part "of the pressure in the marketplace comes from the fact that you do have to be legitimately better," he said. "And if you're not, you're going to suffer the consequences."
They weren't better. Ms. India found that service at many top-tier hotels nose-dived during the pandemic, partly from staffing shortages, and has yet to recover. And how about those $ 10,000 handbags? Taleen Akopyan, who with her husband has worked as a cobbler and a leather restoration expert for the past four decades, said her business has shifted from bags that are 50 years old and still in good shape to brand-new Chanels, Louis Vuittons and Guccis that need help after a few wears. "There's definitely a quality deterioration across the board," she said.
It had to end. By many measures, the luxury market is in free-fall.
LVMH and Kering, which owns brands including Gucci, Balenciaga and Yves Saint Laurent, reported losses this year. Same goes for Burberry; Richemont, which owns Alaïa, Cartier and Chloé; and Capri Holdings, owner of Michael Kors, Versace and Jimmy Choo. A fall study from the management consulting company Bain predicted that 2024 would be the first year of luxury slowdown since the 2008 financial crisis (excluding the pandemic). Certainly the luxury sector tends to be one of the first hit by a slowing economy. But many of the reasons for today's problems the companies brought on themselves.
Some brands are responding by dropping prices, which risks turning a luxury label into a line that's carried by outlet malls and desired by virtually no one. Investors shouldn't have lauded Burberry's new C.E.O., Joshua Schulman, when in November he announced that among other adjustments, the brand would be reducing the prices of its handbags.
Perhaps the most egregious sign of the problem is the fact that luxury goods are winding up on the shelves of discount outlet stores. Dumping excess product in less-than-glamorous locations can be so destructive to a brand's perception that some companies used to set excess product on fire to avoid such a fate. And yet, according to Bain, at the end of 2023, that's exactly where about 13 percent of all luxury goods were purchased, compared with 5 percent a decade earlier.
Some brands are trying to hold the line. In a July interview, LVMH's chief financial officer, Jean-Jacques Guiony, implied that price increases won't "end just because the aspirational customers are a little under pressure." Fun fact: LVMH's fashion and leather-goods sales did a 5 percent belly flop in 2024's third quarter. So perhaps pressure isn't so much the problem as subpar, overpriced goods, like the $ 2,816 Christian Dior bags that were discovered to have been made in an Italian sweatshop for around $ 57.
What happened to these once-prestigious bastions of craftsmanship and fabulousness? The eponymous founder of Louis Vuitton was born into a family of artisans in 1821 and dedicated his life to studying and perfecting trunk making. Chanel was founded by Coco Chanel in the early 20th century and brilliantly designed sporty wares for women that freed them from corsets. Christian Dior invented the New Look in 1947, an immaculately designed, hyperfeminine silhouette that was a return to belle epoque glamour after the austerity of World War II. These brands and their peers long upheld the traditions and standards of their founders -- until they didn't. When short-term bottom lines matter more than history and heritage, corners get cut, the soul gets snuffed out, and the product becomes trash in a fancy box.
An exception is Hermès. The company has raised the cost of its Birkin 30 bag in Togo leather just 15 percent from 2019 to 2024, taking it from $ 10,900 to $ 12,500. That said, many claim you may have to spend a great amount on other Hermès items to "earn" the privilege of buying one.
Like my sad Kiki boots, much of old-school luxury -- the kind that was so glamorous, lush and exquisite that everyone understood it, many craved it and few could have it -- is beyond repair. Once-revered establishments that prided themselves on craftsmanship, service and cultivating a discerning and loyal customer base have become mass-marketing machines that are about as elegant and exclusive as the Times Square M&M's store.
Today, instant gratification, profit and appearances are more desirable than substance, depth or intrinsic worth. And while the decline of "luxury" might not seem like the end of the world (especially with so many apocalypse-adjacent events unfolding), its fall represents a deeper decay that's gnawing at so much of our existence -- from education, media and literature to interpersonal relationships and quality of life.
But back to shopping. Now is the perfect time to seek skilled, independent craftspeople and designers who remain uncompromised by the luxury conglomerates' production quotas and politics.
If something is obviously awful and obscenely expensive, don't buy it. Don't tout it on Instagram. Tell the manager you know it was mid. I certainly won't be dipping my toes into any Marc Jacobs platforms again. One bruised tailbone was terrible enough. I'll happily tell you all about it.

These Men Can't Get Enough Leather: [Style Desk]

Full text: A younger generation discovers the appeal of wearing skins.
In March, Brandon Mahler took a pair of thrifted leather pants and spliced them into shorts. Holding the results, Mr. Mahler, a fashion consultant in New York, had to acknowledge that he'd crossed the line of sartorial sanity.
"When are you wearing leather shorts?" Mr. Mahler said, speaking with a Hyde-like clarity about this Jekyll-esque tailoring experiment. "They don't make sense."
On other leather items, Mr. Mahler, 33, doesn't hesitate. He owns three pairs of leather pants, several leather jackets and a prized Zegna leather blazer that called out to him at a secondhand store like a lustrous needle in the cotton haystack.
"Maybe it's this rebel bad boy thing," he said of his tendency to dress like an oil slick.
Mr. Mahler typifies a cohort of men -- often younger, yes, but also unbothered by the material's many clichés -- that have leaned into leather.
There's Shaboozey, the country-rap warbler who appeared on "Saturday Night Live" this month outfitted in leather from his boots to his bolo tie; Timothée Chalamet, putting a fine point on his rocker pivot by wearing a black leather Prada blazer on the "A Complete Unknown" red carpet; and the Memphis Grizzlies player Jaren Jackson Jr., who arrived at a recent game in inky leather pants and a matching leather tank top.
In stores, glossy options are available at all price points. Bottega Veneta's $ 6,700 made-ya-look calfskin shirt is printed to look like pedestrian flannel. Zara's oversize "leather blazer" sells for $ 139 though it's polyester. Somewhere in between are Supreme's $ 498 baggy leather pants.
Still, leather is one of those tripwire fabrics in men's fashion. To wear it is to face that you will look like you're doing a thing. Even men who clothe themselves in hides concede that there is a theatricality to the look.
"It's been hard for me to find a leather jacket that feels like it's not totally a costume," said Albert Muzquiz, 29, a fashion content creator in Los Angeles who posts under the name @EdgyAlbert.
Women, more conditioned to trying trends, are freer to toy with leather. It is unlikely that a woman in a leather blazer would be called Donnie Brasco. Men, as more than one source noted for this article, cannot skirt that same fate.
"Men don't want to be a caricature," said Savannah Yarborough, the designer of Savas, a leather specialty label with stores in Nashville and Los Angeles. In the past year, Ms. Yarborough has introduced $ 2,600 leather pants cut like five-pocket jeans and created full leather suits for clients. Her most "strange to witness" request, she said, was a zip-up leather hoodie, though she has now sold a number of them. (Wearing leather, of course, can be a base signifier that you spent money.)
"There's a sense of someone needing to give men permission because they're afraid that they may look like they're trying to be something," Ms. Yarborough said.
Savas also manufactured Mr. Muzquiz's ideal leather jacket: a raven-black blazer with peak lapels. He described the jacket as a sort of armor. "I often wear this one to clout-y L.A. events that I probably shouldn't really be invited to," he said.
Wearing it also makes him think of Brian De Palma's porn-industry thriller "Body Double," one of a number of '80s films -- erotic and otherwise -- to feature a leather-blazered main character. "There's just a real sexiness" to the glossy jacket, Mr. Muzquiz said.
The more you talk to men about leather, the more you realize their touch points can vary.
Some offer Leonardo DiCaprio's cigar-brown leather jacket from "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood" as a template. Others propose the cast of "The Matrix," photos of which are regurgitated today on Y2K-worshiping Instagram accounts. A few nod to the gay subculture captured in the work of the artist Tom of Finland, though the mainstreaming of the leather trend has done much to mute those homoerotic overtones.
The leather hall of fame balloons with names like the Starchitect Peter Marino, who CBS News said dresses like a "bouncer at a leather bar"; Elvis Presley, who played his 1968 comeback special in a glossy leather suit; and John Shaft in his imposing black leather trench.
Leather detractors had their feelings captured in "The Leather Man," a much watched 2002 "Saturday Night Live" skit in which a leathered-up salesman played by Jimmy Fallon tried to sell a customer on venturing into the gloss. "Nothing's sexier than a pair of capri pants made from rattlesnakes," he implored. Nothing's squeakier either per the sketch, which had Mr. Fallon lumbering through the store, his outfit whining like a trapped mouse with each step.
Squeaks are trivial to Bryce Lennon, 37, a cartographer and part-time fashion blogger in Lumberton, N.J., who recently snatched up a boxy leather blazer at Goodwill. "I have an Afro, so it's giving 1970s," Mr. Lennon said. He can be swayed to the full leather look (the "Finnish tuxedo," if you will), but only if the shades match.
"The blacks have to go together, or it's just not gonna look right," he said.
The secondhand provenance of Mr. Lennon's blazer is pivotal to explaining how leather has gained traction again for young men. "We're going to these thrift stores, finding these pieces for $ 15, $ 20, and falling in love with them," said Raj Modi, a corporate analyst in Chicago who recently located a classic black leather blazer at a thrift store for $ 15.
This is a real-world example of fashion trend cycles at work: middle-aged men clean out their closets, including those leather jackets that they long ago downgraded from suave to sleazy. Those jackets land at thrift stores on the cheap where a new generation sees them as novel, even covetable.
"It's a little oversize," Mr. Modi, 24, said of his jacket. "It's got the shoulder pads." In it, he said: "I feel so freaking cool. There's no other way to explain it."

She Glides Down the Runway: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Madison Chock has earned a reputation for ice dancing in costumes as dazzling as her performances.
The Chrysler Building. Salvador Dalí. Billie Eilish. Aliens. All have inspired costumes worn by the figure skater Madison Chock, who is known not only for intricate twizzles and lifts but also for competing in ensembles that have raised the bar for fashion in her sport. Almost all of her costumes over the last two decades have been designed by Ms. Chock herself.
On Saturday, she and her skating partner and husband, Evan Bates, won their second consecutive gold medal for ice dancing at the Grand Prix Final competition in Grenoble, France. For their jazzy free dance routine, Ms. Chock wore a shimmering geometric costume that she said had taken inspiration from the Chrysler Building and other Art Deco architecture.
"Figure skating has so much room for fashion," said Ms. Chock, who often looks to runway shows by high fashion labels like Schiaparelli and Mugler as inspiration for her ensembles. "I am very passionate about design, and I'm in a sport that's unique because we have an ability to combine creativity with athleticism."
Ice dancing is typically performed in pairs, and unlike figure skating, it does not involve jumping. Instead, top duos like Ms. Chock and Mr. Bates -- who are five-time U.S. national champions and Olympic gold medalists -- incorporate highly technical footwork patterns and aerial lifts into programs choreographed like ballroom dances.
In recent years, as ice dancing has become more theatrical, so too have athletes' costumes. But few have rivaled those Ms. Chock, 32, has designed for herself and Mr. Bates, 35, whose ensembles are meant to complement his wife's.
The costumes she and Mr. Bates wore at the Grand Prix Final were created for a program set to music by Thelonious Monk and Dave Brubeck. The skaters, who live in Montreal, debuted the looks at the Skate America competition in October. Covering Ms. Chock's iridescent dress, which was the greenish color of oxidized copper and had a flapper-style skirt, were more than 10,000 rhinestones.
Johnny Weir, the former professional skater who is now a commentator on the sport for NBC, said in an interview that Ms. Chock and Mr. Bates might be the most fashionable skaters currently competing.
During the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, Mr. Weir, who is known for his own bold style, described Ms. Chock's performances with Mr. Bates as a version of haute couture. Her Olympic costumes included a slime green dress for a short program set to "Bad Guy" by Billie Eilish, as well as a silvery dress and coordinating makeup for an extraterrestrial-themed free dance to songs by Daft Punk.
"Couture fashion shows are not about appealing to masses," Mr. Weir said in an interview. "It's about creating a spectacle, and I think they do that with costumes."
Ms. Chock's ensembles begin as sketches. To fabricate them, she often works with Mathieu Caron, a costumer for skaters and ballroom dancers. "She has very good taste," Mr. Caron said of Ms. Chock. "Year after year, she pushes the boundaries. It's the whole package, even hair and makeup -- every detail is planned."
Ms. Chock and Mr. Bates have not been the only models for her costumes: Last year, she started a namesake company offering her design services to other skaters.
This season Ms. Chock worked with Olivia Smart, an ice dancer for Spain, to develop a hooded, sand-colored dress for a program inspired by "Dune" that Ms. Smart performed with her teammate, Tim Dieck. The costume's hood, Ms. Chock said, "adds mystery and intrigue." Mr. Caron created a coordinating ensemble for Mr. Dieck.
Ms. Chock and Mr. Bates wrap up their current skating season in March, after which they will begin focusing on the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. They plan to start selecting music in the spring or early summer, Ms. Chock said, and then she will get to work on coming up with accompanying costumes.
"I'm very excited the Olympics will be in Milan, which is a great city for fashion," said Ms. Chock, who in preparation has been paying particular attention to runway shows from Prada and other labels in Italy. "Going into the Olympics, I'm very inspired by Italian designers."

She May Be Gone, but Her Headband Isn't Forgotten: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A wide and tightfitting hair accessory favored by the wife of John F. Kennedy, Jr., has become a hot commodity, 25 years after her death.
Nicole Nigro, a 24-year-old software engineer in Brooklyn, was not yet born when a plane crash killed John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy and her sister Lauren Bessette on July 16, 1999.
But Ms. Bessette-Kennedy was at the top of Ms. Nigro's mind on Friday when she went to Zitomer, an upscale pharmacy on Manhattan's Upper East Side, looking for a headband she saw in TikTok videos. Specifically, a tortoiseshell headband that is 1.375 inches wide, costs $ 35 and has been linked to Ms. Bessette-Kennedy because she was photographed wearing it multiple times before she died at 33.
In the 25 years since, Ms. Bessette-Kennedy, a former publicist at Calvin Klein, has for many people functioned as a posthumous fashion influencer. Some of them, like Ms. Nigro, learned about her through social media posts highlighting Ms. Bessette-Kennedy's preference for minimalist clothing. ("Simple and timeless," as Ms. Nigro put it.)
But unlike Ms. Bessette-Kennedy's clothes from designer labels like Yohji Yamamoto and Prada -- some of which are currently on auction at Sotheby's -- the tortoiseshell headbands offer an accessible way to emulate her style. They have been branded the "CBK Headband" online and by some fashion publications, a term that is used to describe both the exact style worn by Ms. Bessette-Kennedy and other tortoiseshell headbands of varying widths, colors and makers.
The 1.375-inch-wide headbands she wore are made by Charles J. Wahba, a label founded in New York City in 1959. Handmade in France of acetate, its headbands can fit tightly, but are said to mold to the shape of a wearer's head. They are sold at other luxurious pharmacies, including C.O. Bigelow in Greenwich Village, where Ms. Bessette-Kennedy is said to have bought her headbands.
But no store has sold them longer than Zitomer, where Ms. Bessette-Kennedy is said to have shopped as well (for shampoo and scrunchies). The nearly 75-year-old pharmacy, which is known for its extensive selection of hair accessories, has carried the label's headbands, claw clips and barrettes since 1976.
On the day that Ms. Nigro visited Zitomer to find a headband, Shreya Bhide, 28, also stopped by to look for one. "It was what -- like one century, a half a century ago?" Ms. Bhide, a software engineer in San Jose, Calif., said of the era when Ms. Bessette-Kennedy wore the accessory.
While only a quarter century ago, it was a time before people's daily lives were documented online. Photos taken of Ms. Bessette-Kennedy and articles written about her before she died are some of the only ways to get a peek at her life. That may be part of her allure among younger people, said Mimi Stillman, a 28-year-old freelance video producer in Columbus, Ohio.
"I'm not old enough to recall her, but I think it's so interesting her aura has transcended to my generation," said Ms. Stillman, who bought a Wahba headband at Zitomer in July and documented the purchase in a TikTok video. "There are no new photos; I would like to know more about her."
This year, Zitomer has tripled its inventory of Wahba hair products, partly because of the headband's popularity, said Sharon Sternheim, the pharmacy's owner. Ms. Sternheim added that she has "never seen such a young crowd coming into the store." She estimated that lately, more than half of its weekend customers had been under 40.
Joey Wahba, who runs the hair accessories label started by and named for his father, said the surge of interest in its headband associated with Ms. Bessette-Kennedy had resulted in an uptick in sales: The company has sold some 10,000 this year, about 10 times more than it did in 2023. In addition to pharmacies like Zitomer and C.O. Bigelow, Wahba items are sold at roughly 80 locations nationwide, including hair salons. The company itself does not sell items online, however -- it doesn't have a website or any social media accounts.
"It's amazing she became someone that today's generation admires," Mr. Wahba said of Ms. Bessette-Kennedy.
Those admirers include the actress Annabelle Dexter-Jones, 38, who on a phone call recalled glimpsing Ms. Bessette-Kennedy in the crowd at the Calvin Klein fashion shows that Ms. Dexter-Jones attended as a child with her mother, Ann Dexter-Jones, a jewelry designer.
Ms. Dexter-Jones, who grew up in New York and is a longtime Zitomer customer, said she has purchased dozens of tortoiseshell headbands at the pharmacy, including Wahba styles. She added that Ms. Bessette-Kennedy's appearance partly informed that of Naomi Pierce, the publishing heiress Ms. Dexter-Jones played on HBO's "Succession."
"I think her style is timeless and Zitomer is timeless and that's what is so appealing about those headbands," she said.

Holiday Windows That Sparkle: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This year's displays include tens of thousands of rhinestones, retired taxis and a "Wicked"-themed forest menagerie.
At many retail stores around the country, decorating for the holiday season involves inflatables, premade wreaths, and classic red and green ornaments.
But for a few department stores in New York City, the marketing tradition of creating holiday window displays, which dates to the 1870s, is a nearly yearlong process that involves dozens of artisans, thousands of hours and hundreds of handcrafted items
At one of those stores, Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue, a team of three artists spent six weeks hand-setting more than 100,000 rhinestones onto a 10-foot praying mantis.
Here are how four of the department store holiday window displays in New York City come together.
A Nod to New York at Bergdorf Goodman
The Bergdorf Goodman windows on Fifth Avenue are typically stuffed with knickknacks, often sparkling or rhinestone-encrusted.
"It may first appear chaotic, but the arrangement of the items is organized down to the millimeter," said David Hoey, the senior director of visual presentation at the retailer.
This year's theme, which is devoted to attractions along Fifth Avenue, honors New York City's parks, shopping, taxicabs, libraries and other landmarks.
Bergdorf Goodman worked with more than a dozen artisans, including a papier-mâché artist and a sculptor, to create the displays.
But to fill the taxicab window, it turned to an unexpected source: junkyards in the Bronx and Brooklyn.
A team of designers found taxi doors, hoods and grills to use in the window, which features flashing LED digital lights fashioned into a starburst pattern.
"Every year we try to master a new craft," Mr. Hoey said.
Swinter at Saks
There is some intentional seasonal confusion in Saks's florally bedecked holiday displays this year.
Mannequins wear sleeveless white-and-pink Prada dresses adorned with rosettes, a contrast with an oversized illuminated snowflake in a corner of the window.
"Since there are so many ways to celebrate the holidays, and to dress for them, we didn't limit ourselves to any single sensibility, season or designer," said Andrew Winton, the senior vice president of creative at Saks.
While the building's facade is no longer twinkling with hundreds of thousands of LED lights -- the store nixed its light show this year, in an apparent move to cut costs -- the designers still had fun playing with vibrant looks.
Among the most distinctive items is a pair of Loewe floral beaded leather biker boots, inspired by the work of the American painter Albert York.
A Hand-Drawn Holiday at Macy's
The windows at the Macy's on 34th Street in Herald Square are animated again this year.
This includes a selfie station -- visitors can take a photo and see it reflected behind a shiny Santa Claus -- a disappearing and reappearing teddy bear, and elves seated in a revolving silver heart.
"We always try to bring joy to families, as well as excitement and a little warmth," said Manny Urquizo, the national window and campaign director for Macy's.
The theme of this year's windows is "Give Love."
More than 600 mentees in New York-area chapters of the Big Brothers Big Sisters of America program created hand-drawn ornaments that hang in two of the windows. They were asked to illustrate moments of giving back during the holiday season.
There are snowmen, presents, cookies for Santa -- even the Grinch (presumably post heart-enlargement).
A "Wicked" Wardrobe at Bloomingdales
The stars of Bloomingdale's windows are Glinda and Elphaba, the witches from Jon M. Chu's big-screen adaptation of the Broadway musical "Wicked."
In Glinda's pink window, you'll find vintage trunks, a working gramophone and swinging chandeliers. A stack of pink books, blank spines facing out, stretches toward the ceiling.
"It was really hard to find pink books," said Aaron Romero, the associate creative director of visual experience at Bloomingdale's. "So we rejacketed and resurfaced vintage books with pink fabric."
When it came to Elphaba, the designers wanted to celebrate her intellect, resourcefulness and resilient spirit.
Elphaba's signature black hat rests on a green-skinned mannequin that is surrounded by the woods, which are filled with a rabbit, a fox and a lion cub fashioned from pine leaves. Each animal took about a month to make by hand.
Another scene is set in a lab, complete with glowing beakers and green-bound books. The eclectic titles are from published books, among them "Cannibals and Missionaries."

Full text: And a dozen other looks that made news at Britain's Met Gala of style.
She wasn't even nominated, and Rihanna still stole the show Monday night at the Fashion Awards in London.
Arriving last, as has become her wont at events like the Met Gala and the Alaïa show, and there as a plus-one to support her partner, ASAP Rocky, who received the Cultural Innovator award, the artist and Fenty mogul made her entrance in a turquoise wrap coat and faux fur hat from Christian Lacroix's fall 2002 couture collection. With that she wore a black corset, black leather opera gloves and sheer black tights. The effect was kind of haute Flintstone meets the Folies Bergère.
As for ASAP Rocky, he wore Bottega Veneta -- a navy chore coat, matching pants and a red leather tie -- and called the honor "surreal." That was also an accurate description of the Royal Albert Hall, where the awards were held and where a crimson disco ball cast a new light on a familiar scene. But it was Rihanna's enormous hat, jauntily tilted and visible from every vantage point, that summed up the point of the night: The business of fashion may be serious, but wearing it should be fun.
Her look was as laudable as the actual winners, who included Alex Consani as model of the year, the first trans woman to receive the recognition; Grace Wales Bonner as British men's wear designer of the year; Simone Rocha as British women's wear designer; and Jonathan Anderson of Loewe and JW Anderson as designer of the year for the second year in a row.
That choice wasn't a big surprise, especially given Mr. Anderson's moonlighting this year as the costume designer on the Luca Guadagnino films "Queer" and "Challengers" and the multiple wild rumors surrounding his future job prospects, but some of the other outfits were. Here's what else caught our eye.
More Method Dressing
Nicola Coughlan and Simone Ashley proved that while you can take the girls out of "Bridgerton," you can't take "Bridgerton" out of the girls' wardrobes. Ms. Coughlan channeled her character, Penelope Featherington, post-glow-up in an off-the-shoulder black velvet Gaurav Gupta gown with exaggerated aqua satin panniers, while Ms. Ashley summoned a whiff of Kate Sharma in strapless ivory Prada with a bell-shaped miniskirt -- and billowing train. Lady Whistledown would approve.
Suiting the Moment
Venus Williams, in a Thom Browne overcoat and plunging jumpsuit, and Rita Ora, in an oversize double-breasted gray jacket from her collaboration with Primark, the British high street brand, and a pink tie, were ready for business. Ms. Ora said her look, which included bleached blond eyebrows and mullet, was a homage to David Bowie. As he once sang, "Fa fa fa fa fashion."
Musk-fluence?
Jodie Turner-Smith, who accompanied Burberry's creative director, Daniel Lee, accessorized her buttery, bias-cut (yup) Burberry gown, encrusted in silver sequins and beads, with two bunches that jutted, antenna-like, from the top of her head. Just in case, you know, she needed to radio her spaceship to make a quick getaway. Or contact Elon Musk.
Northern and Southern Exposure
Naked dressing is the red carpet trend that will never die -- it simply gets more daring. Such, anyway, seemed to be the message from Julia Fox, in a sheer Dilara Findikoglu corset and petticoat frock with strategically placed boning, and Ming Lee Simmons in transparent gold-beaded Sau Lee. It's one way to suggest you have nothing to hide.
Brand Building
Why waste a good social media snap? Sabato De Sarno of Gucci, who took home a special recognition award in honor of a campaign focusing on London, brought the model Yanan Wan to the event, each of them doing their best impression of a walking billboard in head-to-toe "Ancora red," the color Mr. de Sarno has made a Gucci signature since taking over as creative director last year. Michèle Lamy, who presented the Cultural Innovator award to ASAP Rocky and is the partner and muse of Rick Owens, went full batwing goth. That's not just advertising. It's commitment.
Season's Greetings
Ellie Goulding, in a pristine white Moncler Genius puffer coatdress (a puffer coatdress! Who knew?), and Gemma Chan, in snowy Self-Portrait x Christopher Kane, looked as if they had just stepped off a sleigh after a ball at the North Pole. Santa would definitely approve.

Eye Infection Saddles Elton John: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: After a performance of "The Devil Wears Prada" in London, John told the crowd that the effects of an eye infection were continuing to limit his eyesight.
Elton John's eyesight problems have persisted to the point where he could not see a performance of his own musical in London on Sunday night, he told the crowd after the show.
John, 77, appeared onstage after a charity performance of the musical "The Devil Wears Prada," for which he wrote the score, at the Dominion Theatre.
"I haven't been able to come to many of the previews, because as you know I've lost my eyesight, so it's hard for me to see it," he said, wearing bright red sunglasses. "But I love to hear it."
John announced in a social media post in September that an eye infection this summer had left him "with only limited vision in one eye."
"I am healing, but it's an extremely slow process and it will take some time before sight returns to the impacted eye," he added. "I have been quietly spending the summer recuperating at home, and I am feeling positive about the progress I have made in my healing and recovery thus far."
He provided an update on "Good Morning America" late last month. "I unfortunately lost my eyesight in my right eye in July," he said. "It's been four months now since I haven't been able to see, and my left eye's not the greatest. There's hope and encouragement that it should be OK."
Asked about a possible new album, he replied: "Going into the studio and recording, I don't know, because I can't see a lyric for a start. I can't see anything, I can't read anything, I can't watch anything."
John did not respond to requests for comment on Monday sent through his talent agencies.
When "The Devil Wears Prada" opened in Chicago in 2022 with a different cast, The New York Times said in a review, "The songs unfold pleasantly enough, with flashes of glam and morsels of wit, but they tend to feel last-season."
The musical is based on the 2006 film and the 2003 best-selling semi-autobiographical novel by Lauren Weisberger. The London production stars Vanessa Williams.
John also wrote the score for "Tammy Faye," which is set to close on Broadway this week after only 29 regular performances. He has also written the score for some hits, including "Billy Elliot" and the long-running "The Lion King."
In January, John picked up an Emmy, giving him a lifetime sweep of the major American awards, an accolade known as an EGOT -- an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony. But he was not present at the ceremony to receive the Emmy because of a knee operation.

Handbags Go on a Charm Offensive: [Style Desk]

Full text: Bag charms -- or key chains by another name -- have begun to rival holiday ornaments in their variety and as a form of self-expression.
It's easy enough to picture a blue button-up shirt, a pleated mini skirt and ballet flats on a person. Now imagine the outfit on a bag.
That ensemble is one of the many ways people can dress up a handbag with bag charms, items used to accessorize another accessory. As they have proliferated, charms have started to rival holiday ornaments in their variety and availability.
The dangly products are sold at a range of retailers, including mall chains like Claire's and luxury department stores like Bergdorf Goodman. They take the forms of fruits, vegetables, animals, robots, shopping bags -- even handbags. For example: Louis Vuitton's Speedy Monogram charm, a 2.4-inch-wide version of the brand's popular Speedy bag. At $ 815, it is one of many charms that cost more than some handbags themselves.
Others include Miu Miu's leather charms resembling a shirt, a micro-mini skirt and ballet flats (all $ 625 each), as well as the label's cord-and-nylon charm ( $ 440), which, as noted in several TikTok videos, evokes a lanyard made at summer camp. The luxury brand Loewe also sells charms like a fluffy felt corgi ( $ 550), a leather pea pod containing resin peas ( $ 490) and a bundle of asparagus made with beaded felt ( $ 790).
"All the brands seem to be jumping on it," said Lori Hirshleifer, 65, whose family has owned and operated the store Hirshleifers in Manhasset, N.Y., for several generations.
"I see people around me and the store and the area adorning their bag," Ms. Hirshleifer added, describing fascination with bag charms as "almost contagious." She has not been immune to their appeal: Her collection includes charms from Loewe, Chrome Hearts and Prada, some of which she has shown off on social media.
Prices for other charms may be more in line with what some might expect to pay for key chains by another name. At Bloomingdale's, the available styles include a miniature version of the department store's Little Brown Bag ( $ 12); a peach from Maison de Sabré ( $ 69); and a heart-shaped quilted coin purse from Kurt Geiger London ( $ 65).
Bag charms have resonated with customers of the department store who are "craving a way to show their personal style," said Marissa Galante Frank, the fashion director for accessories and beauty at Bloomingdale's.
She added that interest in the charms has risen on the heels of now-waning trends like quiet luxury, which prescribed that clothes and accessories be simple and staid. As Ms. Galante Frank put it, charms are a "way to make a more serious handbag feel unique."
Justine Clenquet, 33, an accessories designer in Lille, France, offered a similar explanation for the interest her bag charms, which include puffy hearts and teddy bears (both $ 76). She said her customers skew younger and "prefer to have something more classic for a bag and more playful for the charms" -- like her current best-selling style, a large silver bellybutton barbell ( $ 65) -- "because you can remove it if you don't like it anymore."
Though newly fashionable, bag charms are not new. For decades, Hermès has been associated with the baubles largely because of Jane Birkin, who was known to adorn her namesake Birkin bags with stickers and key chains. (The current charm selection at Bloomingdale's includes vintage Hermés styles like a multicolor pony for $ 650.)
Online, the term "Birkinfy" has become shorthand for Ms. Birkin's way of accessorizing handbags. Chloe Jackson, a 32-year-old tattoo artist, learned about bag charms after encountering the term on Pinterest.
On Thursday, Ms. Jackson was browsing the selection of charms at Anthropologie in Rockefeller Center while visiting New York from Las Vegas, where she lives. The store is one of several Anthropologie locations with a stand-alone display for bag charms, like a carabiner with faux pearl accents ( $ 28) and themed styles for cities including Nashville and London (both $ 32).
Hanging from Ms. Jackson's leopard print bag were a wolf tail and a doll she had made with her daughter. "I'm super into oddities and creepy things," she said, explaining that the items decorating her bag "add a personal touch."
Since Anthropologie started selling bag charms in August, they have become some of the most searched for items on its website, said Jessica Irick Peek, the company's general merchandise manager for accessories. She added that Anthropologie sold more than 10,000 charms between August and October.
"People are looking to make things unique for themselves," Ms. Irick Peek said.
For those with little time to look for bag charms who are willing to pay a premium, certain brands offer ways to streamline the process. Balenciaga is selling bags that come adorned with various charms (starting at $ 4,600), as is Prada (starting at $ 3,750).

Even Cardinals Can Be Catty About Clothes: [Style Desk]

Full text: In the film "Conclave," the costume designer Lisy Christl clothed an army of catty cardinals, from their miters down to their quirky glasses.
Set in Vatican City, Edward Berger's new movie, "Conclave," is ostensibly about a clique of catty cardinals jockeying to become the next pope.
Centered around a tortured Cardinal Lawrence, played by Ralph Fiennes, and also starring Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow and Isabella Rossellini, "Conclave" is rife with scenes of cigarette-smoking clergymen meeting in shadow-filled stairwells, gasp-inducing vote counts and midnight break-ins. The movie (based on a 2016 novel by Robert Harris) falls somewhere between a John le Carré novel and an episode of "Survivor."
But "Conclave," in many ways, is also about clothes. Mr. Berger's camera lingers on close-ups of the cardinal's gargantuan gold crucifixes, his ruby-red robes and his art-teacherlike glasses. In one sequence, two holy men poke fun at the supersized scale of a former pope's vestments (again, these are some catty clerics). Later, a crucial confrontation takes place in a cloakroom.
It's of little surprise that a film set in the Vatican would be so preoccupied with style. From their ritualistic robes to their footwear and statement socks, religious figures like priests, cardinals and popes have always had a striking, idiosyncratic fashion sense.
Row after row of cardinals in identical crimson robes makes for a visually stunning film, but one that, as the "Conclave" costume designer Lisy Christl explained, was a challenge to design for.
"The fabric is horrible," on the genuine cassocks, Ms. Christl said. "I don't want to be disrespectful," she added, but to her eyes, the drape of the genuine papal garb "looks like a curtain."
In rethinking the vestments for "Conclave" she took some liberties. Reds are richer, accessories zestier, and cassocks have a couture shapeliness to them. The clothes in "Conclave," are gorgeous to behold but perhaps wouldn't entirely fool the Pontifical Swiss Guard.
In a recent interview, Ms. Christl elaborated on how she updated these ritualistic garments, the hidden significance of each cardinal's hulking crucifix and how she plucked inspiration from Balenciaga. This conversation has been edited and condensed.
This film was quite a departure from movies you've worked on in the past, so how did you go about learning the ins and outs of liturgical fashion?
We had a clerical adviser, the wonderful Francesco Bonomo, and I asked him, "Is there a book for beginners, the ABC's of how to understand the clergy's clothes?" And he said "No. No." So, I read a lot. I have a lot of books about this subject [She pointed to a full bookshelf].
How much did all of that reading end up factoring into the film?
I did this extensive research and I put it into a book, and I sent it to Edward [Berger] and he said: "Great, thank you, so it's good homework. Is it creative? No."
And then I saw this couture show from Balenciaga, it was spring 2020. (A show featuring goth ball gowns with ginormous belled skirts.) I thought: Look at this, this is interesting. I love minimalism and at the same time a modern forward-facing silhouette or exaggeration. One week later, Edward sends me the same clip and he said, "Isn't this inspiring?" And this was a kind of permission: You can bring in your taste. It's allowed.
So how did you start to put your stamp on things?
We went to Rome and we saw the actual cassocks and how their red color burns in your eye. It's quite orangy, the actual color. I worked with a friend of mine, Marie Heitzinger; she's a textile artist. I showed her Renaissance paintings, the reds -- you can feel a color if you like it or not -- and then she started to dye around these paintings like Velasquez or Francis Bacon. I would say our red is bluer and warmer.
Because all the cardinals wear the same thing, in the movie, accessories, glasses in particular, are really important to giving each character their own flair, so to speak. Where did that idea come from?
When you see the real cardinals, they only wear glasses that look like they cost $ 2.50 and are from 1985. It's just not elegant at all. I thought, why not just give it a little bit of something extra, not too obviously. We worked with an Italian brand, Bobsdrunk, and I went with the face, what fits Stanley Tucci, what fits John Lithgow.
I'm curious about the crucifixes too. They really range from cardinal to cardinal. What was the meaning behind those?
With the crosses, cardinals show: are you liberal, are you conservative. It's like with the presidential ties in the states. The golden ones are the conservatives and the silver ones are the liberals. There are also wooden ones but on camera they looked a bit like a toy.
My Italian supervisor introduced me to a goldsmith in Florence, Riccardo Penko. It was not cheap, but he made everything. He made all the crosses, he made the jewelry. He's 25 and his family works for the archdiocese in Florence and all this belongs to the making of this movie. You cannot do a movie like this in Albuquerque, N.M. You have to be there and then you understand the power of this crazy world.
It's long been known that Gammarelli makes clothes for the real-world pope. Did you shop at that store for the film?
No, but I went there. This is part of my understanding of the whole business. I sourced fabric swatches there, I asked about the price for a choir dress from head to toe. They were very willing to make it. It's not holy, it's not secretive, it's a lot about money making.
After working on the film, did you start to see more of a crossover between the high fashion world and these ritualistic papal clothes?
Before doing the research for "Conclave," I looked at Balenciaga, Dolce & Gabbana, Jil Sander (designed by Luke and Lucie Meier), Prada and many others from a different perspective. Now I can see the inspiration from the Roman Catholic Church all over the place. I think it's the clear structure. When you learn about all the orders and what they wear, it's so elegant.
So has anyone from the Vatican reached out to you after seeing the film?
No, but I got an email from a Jesuit in Baltimore. He said how much he loves the costumes and he wished, like, the Curia would be dressed like this.

Star Turn for the Long Black Dress: [Style Desk]

Full text: As the artist brings her Las Vegas residency to an end, she leaves behind a major fashion legacy. Just call her Madame A.
This weekend, Adele's Las Vegas residency comes to an end and with it what may have been the most striking series of LBDs since Audrey Hepburn stepped out of a cab in "Breakfast at Tiffany's" wearing Givenchy. Those initials don't just stand for little black dress anymore.
By the time the artist takes her last bow, she will have worn more than 50 long black dresses in Vegas (to say nothing of her concerts in Munich and London, where she also wore LBDs) -- a different one every weekend. She started in an off-the-shoulder velvet Schiaparelli, with a long satin sash caught up by a gold buckle speckled with nipples (you read that right). She wore David Koma with crystal roses on Valentine's Day 2023. She channeled Morticia Addams on Halloween that fall in Arturo Obegero. She got Loro Piana to make its first va-va-voom gown this month.
She has worn, in no particular order, LBDs from Stella McCartney, Dior, Carolina Herrera, Harris Reed, Prada, Vivienne Westwood, Robert Wun, Armani, JW Anderson and Ralph Lauren, to name but a few. All were custom-made. She has worked with names from across the industry and rarely repeated a designer twice.
The only guidelines, according to Fernando Garcia, the co-creative director of Oscar de la Renta, who made the glittery sunburst number she wore for her Christmas 2022 performance, were that they be black, long, cut on the curve to show off her waist and needed to have enough give to let her lungs go.
Adele has fancied the LBD for almost as long as she has been in the public eye (see the night-sky Armani LBD she wore to the Grammys in 2012). But the sheer number of black gowns she has worn during her residency, the variety and the consistency of her presentation, marks a new milestone in what may be the most timeless garment in the fashion pantheon.
At a moment when the gravitational pull exerted by social media means that it is often the most outré outfits that are rewarded by the attention economy -- most colorful! And crazy! And fringed! And feathered!-- in a setting that effectively invented the rhinestone X games, Adele's wardrobe has been a riposte to the status quo. Hers is essentially a one-woman campaign to remind the world of the power of elegant understatement.
"When everything is about being seen," choosing a different approach is, ironically, "one way to stand out," said Sarah Collins, the associate chair of fashion marketing and management at the Savannah College of Art and Design, which in 2012 held an exhibition on "The Little Black Dress."
In the physics of fashion, in which for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, the pendulum may be swinging Adele's way -- just in time for the holiday season. According to data from Tagwalk, the fashion search engine, there were more than 800 percent more black dresses in the fall 2024 collections than in 2023.
At Valentino, the then-designer Pierpaolo Piccioli offered 63 variations on the black dress, 45 of them extending from below the knee to the floor. Black, he said, was "interesting because it's the color of these times, and it's very universal but very individual."
He was talking about the sense among some of dark days upon us, but the LBD has always transcended its era.
The long black dress, the more formal variation on the little black dress that Coco Chanel made famous in 1926, actually preceded that particular garment in notoriety by centuries. Its power was immortalized in the 17th-century court portraits of Diego Velázquez, and by John Singer Sargent's 1884 portrait of Madame X (actually Virginie Amélie Gautreau), which was unveiled at the 1884 Paris Salon, scandalized the world thanks to the juxtaposition of skin, cleavage and black velvet.
Audrey Hepburn gave the LBD a boost when she teamed up with Hubert de Givenchy, whose LBD, cut to expose her shoulder bones, was both minimal and provocative. A few decades later, Elizabeth Hurley did it again when she walked the "Four Weddings and a Funeral" red carpet in a Versace LBD with safety pins protecting her modesty. When the Museum of Modern Art held its 2017 "Items: Is Fashion Modern?" exhibition, dedicated to identifying the garments that defined the 20th century, curators included the LBD in the assemblage along with jeans, loafers and the hoodie. Indeed, it opened the whole show.
At this point, you can read into black what you will -- revolution, existentialism, goth, sophistication, mystery, magic, power, grief, solemnity, formality -- which means that the LBD can be all things to all people. "It means that many things go together," Yohji Yamamoto once told The New York Times. "You need black to have a silhouette. Black can swallow light, or make things look sharp."
Either way, what it does, unquestionably, is put the focus on the person wearing it. As Paola Antonelli, the MoMA curator who organized the "Items" show, said, "the LBD allows one to control one's presence in a room or in the city, a fine-tuning of the whole attitude."
There are a variety of theories about why Adele loves black. (She herself is not explaining.) In 2013, her former stylist, Gaelle Paul, said that her decision to wear black was an ode to Johnny Cash, otherwise known as the man in black. But while it may have started out that way, Jamie Mizrahi, Adele's current stylist, who worked closely with each designer to create the custom looks for Las Vegas, offered another interpretation. It's about "déjà vu in the right way," she told The Wall Street Journal at the beginning of the residency. It's about the multitudes of references, the history that came before, much like Adele's music.
As a result, Ms. Collins of SCAD said, "it fits her." Literally and artistically.
The black dresses center her on the stage, acting as a backdrop to her music. The length hides her feet, which are often bare (or in sneakers) for comfort's sake. And, like her peers Taylor Swift and Beyoncé, she works with designers across the industry rather than one in particular, so the result is less redolent of marketing than creative mind-meld. When she wore Gaurav Gupta at the end of October -- a couture LBD with an off-the-shoulder neckline that resembled wings and took 93 hours to make -- Mr. Gupta called it "a defining moment."
For Christopher John Rogers, a designer known for his bright colors, "it was a fun challenge to figure out how to CJR-ify her signature." His solution, which Adele wore for Pride Day last year, was a crepe and silk dress with a train of rainbow stripes.
"There's something very old-world and sculptural about black," Mr. Rogers said.
Yet, despite the fabulousness, the LBD translates relatively easily into the everyday, which is also part of the appeal. "It's democratic -- everyone can wear it," Ms. Collins said. "It's sophisticated. It focuses attention on the silhouette."
"And it is timeless," she continued, pointing out that while colors go in and out of style, black is eternal. That means it is a good investment.
"I think we'll still be looking at Adele's residency 10 years from now as a master class in how to dress up," Mr. Garcia of Oscar de la Renta said.
That's not impossible, since all of Adele's LBDs are being archived, preserved for some point in the future. Even if she does take a long break from music and public appearances, as she has said, these looks could potentially go on: into an exhibition -- or a book.
"So much is about streetwear and casual wear today," Ms. Collins said. "But sometimes, you just want to be glamorous."

Full text: I love socks. But should I be styling them to match the hem of my pants or the color of my shoes or the color in my top?
Nancy, Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y. As far as I am concerned, socks are the underappreciated star of the accessories universe. Handbags get most of the attention, ties and watches a bit, but socks, despite the fact that they are an essential part of everyone's wardrobe, are often treated as an afterthought, the footwear equivalent of the undershirt.
The general approach to socks seems to be: Make them as invisible as possible. If that is the goal, then matching them to your pants is a no-brainer; doing so creates the illusion of an uninterrupted line, adding length to the legs. To make them look even longer, match the shoes, too.
If you are wearing a skirt, adopting the nude-socks-with-nude-shoes solution, as originally championed by the late stylist-turned-designer L'Wren Scott, is another technique that elongates the limbs. By contrast, matching your socks to your top, a variation on the sandwich technique, may result in visually squishing the legs.
But there is another option, which is to treat your socks the way people now treat their handbags: as flags of personality. Even if your socks are covered by trousers, they are revealed as soon as you sit down and your pants leg pulls up a bit, a peekaboo moment that everyone can see. That means socks are a statement, whether you like it or not.
So why not be a little more deliberate? That does not necessarily mean embracing the novelty or joke sock, unless you have a specific reason for doing so.
Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, is a master of the art of sock diplomacy, tailoring his stockings to his schedule and using them as a form of outreach. He has, for example, worn "Star Wars" socks on Star Wars Day (May the Fourth) and rainbow socks that read "Eid Mubarak" to march in a Pride parade that happened to coincide with the holiday that marks the end of Ramadan.
Perhaps that's why many brands have cottoned on to this idea. Prada, Simone Rocha and Saint Laurent offer (often very expensive) socks with rhinestones and other embellishments that are less funny, or punny, and more of a sartorial flourish -- made to be seen. Paul Smith, the British men's wear designer, has made a signature for himself out of striped socks, which his acolytes wear like secret signals of membership in a club. (If you know, you know.)
The point is, you should think of your socks not so much as secondary to your clothing but as jewels in themselves. That means they don't have to match your pants or shoes or top, but they do have to say something coherent about the package.

'They're Not Making Any More Fifth Avenues': [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: IKEA and Uniqlo join luxury fashion houses in owning, rather than leasing, huge retail spaces on the strip. Developers are cashing in.
On the bustling shopping strip of Fifth Avenue in New York City sits something you might not expect to find: an empty lot.
But it won't stay empty for long. The development site at 570 Fifth Avenue, between 46th and 47th Streets, is slated to become a 33-story office tower, anchored by an 80,000-square-foot IKEA store at its base, according to the developer, Extell Development.
Ingka Investments, the real estate arm of Ingka Holding, the world's largest IKEA franchisee, injected "approximately $ 400 million" into the overall project, said Extell's founder and chairman, Gary Barnett. In exchange, Ingka scored a one-third stake in the building and ownership of its retail space.
"Having Ingka come in has been very helpful for us," Mr. Barnett said. "They've injected a very substantial amount of equity. They've become our partner in the actual overall office deal, as well as purchasing their retail space."
Ingka's investment let Extell move forward with its office building, more than a decade after it first started buying up parcels for the development site, Mr. Barnett said. And it let Ingka secure a coveted slice of Fifth Avenue while keeping its popular furniture affordable.
"We can safeguard long-term stability for IKEA, keep overhead costs more predictable and maintain our commitment to providing accessible products," said Jenna Grader, a portfolio manager at Ingka Investments.
Over the past year, competition for a handful of retail spaces on Fifth Avenue has heated up.
"They're not making any more Fifth Avenues," said Gary Phillips, said Gary Phillips, a managing director at Eastdil Secured who represented Extell in Ingka's deal with his colleague Will Silverman. "It's one of one."
Luxury brands have been on a buying spree on the iconic stretch, as Curbed reported this year. Kering (the parent company of Gucci and Balenciaga) and Prada bought retail space from the real estate mogul Jeff Sutton, while LVMH (the parent company of Louis Vuitton) and Rolex intend to rebuild their Fifth Avenue flagships.
But it's no longer just luxury fashion houses investing there, Mr. Silverman said. Geshary Coffee spent $ 38 million to buy 560 Fifth Avenue at the end of last year. Uniqlo entered into a contract in August to buy its 90,732-square-foot retail space at 666 Fifth Avenue for $ 350 million. And more deals may be in the works, with Brookfield Asset Management considering a sale of its building at 685 Fifth Avenue, Bloomberg reported.
"Fifth Avenue is effectively eternal," said Mr. Silverman, who also brokered the Prada, Kering and Uniqlo deals with Mr. Phillips at Eastdil. "When the opportunity arises to secure a location that you're sure you'll want forever, why would you not think about securing it?"
Chasing those opportunities is clearly a part of Uniqlo's strategy, said Zach Redding, a managing director at Colliers who represented the seller in Geshary's 560 Fifth Avenue deal. (Uniqlo bought its flagship at 546 Broadway in 2021.)
"They clearly said to themselves, 'We're going to buy the stores that we want to be in -- in irreplaceable locations,"' Mr. Redding said.
Fifth Avenue retailers tend to pour money into expensive, eye-catching displays. For example, Coach's Fifth Avenue store sports a huge dinosaur made of leather purses, while Uniqlo built a custom T-shirt design studio at its 666 Fifth Avenue location. Owning, rather than renting, means a retailer won't lose that investment, said Brett Herschenfeld, an executive vice president at SL Green Realty.
"They try to create these maisons, so to speak, to have a very unique presence," Mr. Herschenfeld said. "What they're doing technologically with the space -- it's a massive investment. Why not own it? Because at the end of a 10-, 15- or 20-year lease term, you don't."
And retailers have one big, temporary advantage: less competition from traditional investors.
A real estate investor usually rounds up debt and equity to buy a property, with a plan to make that money back by renting out the building to a retailer. But with elevated interest rates and retail rents below their 2015 peak, "those investors are not necessarily lined up out the door," Mr. Redding said.
Retailers can often borrow money at lower interest rates through their corporate banking relationships or use cash, which means they also tend to pay more, said Dan Kaplan, an executive vice president at CBRE who represented Geshary in its 560 Fifth Avenue purchase.
"They're willing to pay the numbers that could entice the sellers to sell," Mr. Kaplan said.
That also seems to be the case for Prada, which bought its location at 724 Fifth Avenue for $ 425 million. That's on the high end of the $ 385 million to $ 426 million that the building was appraised for, according to Women's Wear Daily, and it's more than the $ 365 million the building was valued at in 2018.
(Prada, which also bought 720 Fifth Avenue, and the seller of both buildings, Sutton, did not respond to requests for comment.)
Those high prices are hard to turn down.
Sutton's sale of his Fifth Avenue properties amounted to almost $ 1.8 billion, enough to pay off his loans on the buildings and then some, according to The Real Deal.
With Ingka's multimillion-dollar investment in hand, Extell plans to start excavating the 570 Fifth Avenue site in under two months, Mr. Barnett said. The one-million-square-foot development will include at least 20,000 square feet of additional retail space when it's completed around the end of 2027, according to Extell.
But as more retailers lock down their space, the number of prime storefronts on Fifth Avenue will dwindle, said Mr. Phillips at Eastdil. Buying might be their best bet to stay on it.

Bringing Attitude to the World of Running Gear: [Style Desk]

Full text: Bandit wants to "evolve running," and the apparel company will be in the spotlight during the New York City Marathon.
This summer, Ashley Ellefson, a 39-year-old operations executive, was running along Manhattan's East River Promenade when she spotted a group of men, many of them clad in Bandit Running gear, coming toward her. They ran her off the road.
"I had to very quickly get out of their way, otherwise I was going to be trampled," she said.
Ms. Ellefson, a Bandit fan and member of its subscription program, was training for the Chicago Marathon at the time. Despite her experience on that run, she still tried to buy Bandit's Chicago-themed racing crop when it became available. It was sold out, so she wore a different Bandit top in the race.
"It has this cachet," she said. "And they do a really good job with pockets."
Started in Brooklyn in 2020, Bandit Running is part of the changing face of running apparel, which had never previously had the street fashion cool factor often bestowed upon gear for skateboarding, surfing, basketball and tennis.
Tracksmith, a Boston-based company known for preppy and expensive gear, led the way among cult running brands. But Bandit, alongside other niche brands like Satisfy Running, Saysky and Miler Running, has quickly become respected for its quality and has created a visual shibboleth among more serious runners.
Helping Bandit set itself apart is its New York identity, which has allowed it to leverage the city's own mythology and its wealth of run clubs. Those clubs, for many New Yorkers, have taken running from a solitary pursuit to a scene.
While most of Bandit's sales happen online, where it boasts 18,000 people in its virtual training program, the company has opened two retail locations: one in Greenpoint and one in the West Village. The brand's gear is also carried in 46 stores around the world, with sales having nearly quadrupled this year, according to the company. New product drops sell out in minutes and the company has been bolstered by venture capital funding from, among others, Drive by DraftKings.
Bandit's co-founders include the New Jersey-born brothers Tim and Nick West, who both worked at the e-commerce startup Jet.com, and Ardith Singh, a former college hurdler who worked at the luxury activewear brand Bandier.
The brand's start was fairly simple: Tim West, 31, who ran ultramarathons, couldn't find a sock that stood up to his pooling sweat, so in October 2020, he made his own. A key innovation? Bandit placed its logo on the sock's front, which was ideal for when photos of chic and impressive Bandit wearers showed up on social media. In November 2021, Nick West, 36, and Ms. Singh, 41, joined him in the endeavor.
"We wanted to do it in a way where it was actually building relationships and emotional connections with the running community, so that they become the megaphones," Nick West said.
To wit: Bandit has worked with run clubs, sponsored athletes, set up pop-up shops at marathons and run events out of its shops. A membership program was created in which members get perks like early access to limited drops and discounts on Bandit gear for a $ 125 annual fee.
By the end of 2022, Bandit had opened its brick-and-mortar shop in Greenpoint and had launched apparel -- race crops, compression shorts, sports bras -- for which Ms. Singh sought inspiration from vintage runway creations.
"I get inspired by late '80s, '90s dress shapes, thinking how that could inform a race crop in a beautiful, feminine way," she said, citing inspiration drawn from Prada, Alaïa and Calvin Klein. She looked away from the classic black, or high-visibility colors of the major brands, like Nike and Lululemon, choosing a palette that better reflected the urban environments where most runners run.
That aesthetic is paired with technical aspects that appeal to serious runners, like compression, moisture wicking and support.
"People joke about how they're too cool for school," said Garrett Burger, 35, who runs marathons and is a fan of the brand. "Then there are the performance aspects you can't deny."
Unprompted, Bandit's acolytes frequently bring up the brand's pockets as a reason to convert immediately.
"If you're wanting pockets, they've got them," said Tessa Travis, 37, a creative producer. "And that's so clutch for running clothes."
"Similar to how I don't like feeling my clothing while I'm running, I also don't like to feel my phone bouncing on my body," said Makayla Karr-Warner, 29, a portfolio manager. "There's a phone pocket in the back section of the sports bras. It's such a convenient place to put it."
More than any aspect of its design, however, the scarcity of the brand's items may be what makes it fashionable, with the company developing into something along the lines of the Supreme of running.
"They have exclusivity around them," said Freya Lindvall, 24, a member of the Dashing Whippets run club in New York. "They don't constantly have pieces in stock."
Scarcity is "not our entire model," Nick West said. "There's a piece of it," he added, but he said the company has "staple products that are always meant to be available for people."
"It feels like I'm part of this club," Ms. Karr-Warner said of owning the elusive Bandit gear.
That club's elite nature can, for some, extend to the runner's abilities, which the company seemingly encourages. A Bandit billboard placed strategically near the halfway point of the New York City Marathon's scheduled route in the weeks leading to the race referenced runners seeking personal records: "PRs Don't Run Themselves."
That didn't sit well with everyone.
"I think it's a very elitist, exclusive group," said Ray Walker, 24, who is training for his fourth marathon. "I think that sometimes people can feel intimidated by how fast they go. I don't know if they're necessarily pace inclusive."
The company's founders, however, are happy to push the envelope.
"Our mission: evolve running," said Tim West, clarifying that he was talking about things around the sport, rather than changing the actual act of running.
"We're speaking to the community, better aligning to how they experience the sport," Nick West said.
This month, in conjunction with the New York City Marathon, Bandit will take its next major step, releasing a collection with Asics, the Japanese apparel brand. For the first time in its 75-year history, Asics is letting another brand take the wheel for performance products, placing its logo on Bandit's designs. A shoe collaboration between the companies is expected in 2025.
"They're tapping Bandit to do something that resounds in terms of coolness," Tim West said. "It's a larger audience than we can reach."
Naturally, there is a risk when niche brands experience rapid growth, with consumers always looking for something newer, better and, in the case of modern running apparel, more exclusive.
"It's getting a little too oversaturated," Cole Yi, 31, a consultant who runs a few times a week, said of Bandit. "In New York, if you go to any run club, like 70 percent of people will be wearing the socks."
As for Ms. Ellefson, the marathoner who was run off the road, she is unsure if she will renew her membership. The Bandit sports bra she wore in Chicago "chafed the hell out of my back," she said. She said she is looking to brands like Saysky and Lululemon, and recently sold a pair of her Bandit shorts on Poshmark.
"It's just a logo," she said. "What's the next Bandit?"

A Second Job for a Makeup Artist: Entrepreneur: [Style Desk]

Full text: The makeup artist and influential YouTuber Lisa Eldridge may have cracked the code.
Years ago, Lisa Eldridge, a makeup artist in London best known for working with models and celebrities, woke up the morning after a fashion industry party looking, let's say, less than Picture Day ready.
Instead of sliding back under the covers, she decided to do something she had been considering for some time: She filmed herself applying makeup over her blotches and blemishes, giving pointers along the way, and posted the footage on YouTube, then in its early days as a hub of beauty-focused content.
Her idea, she said, was that the best day to show people makeup tips and tricks was the day you had a tired-looking face. "I do have splotchy redness, my face does feel really tight and dry and oily at the same time -- I've got weird skin -- and my eyes look tired," she said, sitting on a pink velvet, lip-shaped sofa in her northwest London office, appearing dewy and splotch-free.
Ms. Eldridge started posting tutorials on YouTube regularly, gradually amassing more than two million subscribers. She was excited by the new medium -- "I could actually show people how to do makeup in a way I'd never been able to before," she said -- but initially she kept her online profile something of a secret.
"I didn't tell anyone in fashion because I thought they'd look down on me." she said. "I thought publicists would say: 'She's on YouTube now. We're not going to book her."'
Ms. Eldridge doesn't seem to have lost any assignments -- these days she posts on TikTok and Instagram, along with YouTube -- and now she has an additional job: cosmetics entrepreneur. In 2019, she founded a makeup brand, Lisa Eldridge Beauty.
"I wanted to do something that was authentic, something that people could trust," she said. "There are no false claims. There's no smoke and mirrors."
Like her tutorials, Ms. Eldridge's line feels upscale but not hypey or glitzy. It began with three shades of lipstick. Today it sells about 300 items, including a $ 26 tinted lip glosses and a $ 62 eye-shadow palette. Many of the products are highly pigmented and stay on longer than might be expected. Even the matte lipsticks tend not to be drying.
Ms. Eldridge is not the only makeup artist selling self-branded products, of course. There's Charlotte Tilbury, with her hugely successful namesake collection, and Pat McGrath, whose line includes what is reported to be Taylor Swift's red lipstick of choice. There are lines by Gucci Westman, Patrick Ta, Kevyn Aucoin, Serge Lutens, Mario Dedivanovic (the eponym of Makeup by Mario), among others. Ms. Eldridge's company, however, feels more homegrown than much of her competition.
"I've done it a lot slower than them, and I've done it without backing," she said. "My first launch paid for my second launch; my second launch paid for my third launch."
Neither did she have "a great load of investment," she added, "so that within two years you're in all the Sephoras." Ms. Eldridge owns 95 percent of her company; during the pandemic, she sold 5 percent to a friend.
Consumer appetite for the brands of makeup artists remains high. For the first half of this year, lines founded by makeup artists or influencers amounted to nearly 30 percent of overall high-end beauty sales, according to the market research company Circana.
"What sets these brands apart is the trust factor," said Delphine Horvath, an associate professor in the cosmetics and fragrance marketing department at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. "They carry a sense of authority, especially in this crowded beauty market."
The consumer, she said, believes that experts who work regularly with high-profile clients understand product performance and can create high-quality formulations.
This month, Ms. Eldridge introduced Rouge Experience Refillable Lipstick, which sells for $ 59. Each of its eight shades comes in a golden tube that looks like something Elizabeth Taylor might have whipped out in "BUtterfield 8." The packaging isn't designed just for glamour. The containers and refills are made entirely of aluminum, which makes them easier to recycle than a typical lipstick.
Most lipstick tubes have a plastic sheath that's filled with color, and a magnet to click appealingly when it's shut. Both features make curbside recycling a challenge, since local recyclers typically won't separate the components. (Lipsticks are also smaller than the refuse the average recycler will handle.)
"If anyone says, 'It's going to be too small for the machine to recognize,' I'll say, 'Put it into a Coke can,"' Ms. Eldridge said.
High-end refillable lipsticks are having a moment. Chanel, Prada Beauty, Hermès and Dior all have them. Celine Beauty is introducing one this month, in a fancy case designed by its outgoing creative director Hedi Slimane. With these, many brands promote reusing instead of recycling as a way to lessen the environmental footprint of their packaging.
Ms. Eldridge, 54, has been obsessed with cosmetics since she was a child in Liverpool, England. A gift for her 13th birthday -- "Stage Makeup," a 1971 book by Herman Buchman filled with, yes, tutorials -- led her to imagine a career in makeup artistry.
As soon as she was old enough, she moved to London to study and get on-the-job training.
Early on, she sold Lancôme makeup at Harrods but said she was fired for recommending other brands. (She still does that on YouTube, suggesting products by, say, CeraVe, MAC Cosmetics and Clinique alongside her own.) And Ms. Eldridge had the last laugh: Since 2015, she has been Lancôme's global creative director.
As Ms. Eldridge's career as a professional makeup artist has grown, so has her personal archive of cosmetics. She has assembled more than 5,000 vintage items, bought mainly at flea markets and estate sales. A handful of them inspired her new lipstick packaging.
In the process, she has become a historian of sorts. In 2015, she wrote a book, "Face Paint: A History of Makeup" and, in 2021, hosted a three-part BBC documentary "Makeup: A Glamorous History." Her theory, she said in each episode's introduction, is that "what someone puts on their face and why says as much about an era as art, architecture or food."
In the United States, Ms. Eldridge's products are sold only on her website. She hasn't worked with stores here because, she said, "I didn't have the expertise on my team, to be honest, and that side is not really my forte."
Still, American orders account for about 40 percent of her brand's business. Orders doubled in the first six months of this year compared with the same period in 2023, according to the company, which doesn't publicly release sales figures.
Ms. Eldridge is looking for a downtown Manhattan space for a pop-up in the first half of next year.
These days, her YouTube videos sit beside posts from a vast range of influencers and self-proclaimed beauty experts, but that doesn't bother Ms. Eldridge.
"I'm not snobby about that," she said. "Makeup is entertainment now -- that's what it is."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Recently the designer Ulla Johnson was thinking about what she would wear to vote on Tuesday, what would convey how seriously she took the stakes in this election. She was thinking, she said, about wearing a bow-tie blouse -- maybe the crisp lemon yellow cut from her latest collection, tied with a flourish on the side of the neck. She was seeing the style of top more and more, she said, ever since Vice President Kamala Harris wore them at the Democratic National Convention.
Perhaps, she said, the bow-tie blouse could become "a rallying cry."
Clothes have not been an obvious strategic tool in this presidential race -- not the way they were the last time former President Donald J. Trump ran against a woman, back in 2016, when Hillary Clinton made the white suit the iconography of the opposition. Ms. Harris has deliberately decentered identity politics in her campaign and de-emphasized clothing that calls attention to her gender.
And yet despite it all, one garment -- the pussy-bow blouse, or floppy-bow blouse or lavallière blouse, depending on what you want to call it -- has surfaced as a symbol of the moment, seeping into the general consciousness and becoming an unlikely form of self-expression. As it has time and time again throughout history when issues of women's rights and women's power come to the fore.
More than any other piece of clothing that has represented the quest for gender equality, including the once radical notion of women in pants and the battering-ram shoulder pads of the C-suite revolution, the pussy-bow blouse has been a tool of covert sartorial diplomacy. Feminine but not sexual, masculine but not threatening, it functions both as camouflage for women entering traditional male spaces, said Kate Strasdin, a fashion historian at Falmouth University in Cornwall, England, and as "a statement of intent."
"It may be the most enduring symbol of female barrier-crossing we have," she added.
Ms. Harris has worn bow blouses during her most consequential public moments in national politics. In 2020, when she made her first speech as vice president-elect, she wore the blouse with a suffragist white suit, doubly underscoring the pioneering nature of her election. And she has worn one three times since becoming the Democratic candidate for president: during the D.N.C. in August for each of her two onstage appearances, and in September, during her debate with Mr. Trump.
When Catherine, Princess of Wales, appeared for her first official public engagement last month after finishing her cancer treatment, she did so in a bow-tie shirtdress.
This fall, the bow blouse began to reappear on the runway (as did even more literal neckties). There were long, streaming bows juxtaposed against polka-dot jackets at Carolina Herrera. There were bow blouses paired with argyle knits and wrap miniskirts at Prada. At Balenciaga, bows adorned the necks of what appeared to be proper silk dresses from the front but turned out to be fully lingerie-laced at the back. Bows cascaded, ascot-like, down floral tops at Chanel. They provided the time-traveling link between Renaissance jackets and bike shorts at Louis Vuitton.
And a bow blouse from Alessandro Michele's first Valentino collection has pride of place in the window of the Valentino store on Madison Avenue.
"It's a very loaded garment," said Paola Antonelli, a senior curator at the Museum of Modern Art. "A design object used to send a message."
That message may be most clearly embodied by Ms. Harris, but it may have even more to do with the debate about women's bodies and women's autonomy now roiling the national conversation. At this point, the bow-tie blouse is almost as much an idea as an actual item.
And it has been an emblem of the balancing game between emancipation and tradition, transgression and good behavior, that women have been forced to play ever since the style took shape in the 17th century.
The Rise and Fall (and Rise Again) of the Pussy Bow
According to Valerie Steele, the director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, the female bow-tie blouse first appeared in the court of Louis XIV. The king's mistress, Louise de la Vallière, created her own version of the frothy cravat then favored by the (male) court.
The Gibson girls of the late 19th century and the New Women of the early 20th century started wearing bow tie-like bows around their necks when they began "to venture out unaccompanied," Ms. Strasdin said, whether to play classically masculine sports like golf or to go to work. It was a way to "challenge the patriarchy without destabilizing it," she said.
Certainly there was nothing threatening about the moniker "pussy bow," as the garment became known in the 1930s, because of its resemblance to the ribbons occasionally used to adorn pet kittens -- even if, 30 years later, Yves Saint Laurent reclaimed the accessory by adding a pussy-bow tie to his first women's tuxedo, connecting it once again to the concept of gender appropriation.
This notion became even more pronounced in the 1970s, when John T. Molloy wrote "The Woman's Dress for Success" book and recommended that women with executive ambitions adopt floppy bow ties as a feminized version of the necktie (See Jane Fonda in the 1980 movie "9 to 5.")
"It was a way to mediate between more masculine standards and the need to maintain a certain femininity," Ms. Antonelli said.
The bow-tie blouse was a favorite look of Nancy Reagan's during Ronald Reagan's time in the White House. Its most famous proponent, though, was actually Mr. Reagan's peer, Margaret Thatcher, who made the bow blouse part of her signature when she was British prime minister -- in part, she said in a television interview in 1985, because it softened her image. It became so associated with Mrs. Thatcher and the Conservative Party that Samantha Cameron, then the first lady of Britain, wore a pussy-bow blouse to the Iron Lady's funeral in 2013.
And thus it was defined until the election of 2016, when Melania Trump appeared at a debate wearing a hot pink pussy-bow blouse only days after her husband's "grab 'em" comment became public.
Her choice was widely seen as an attempt by Mrs. Trump to troll ... somebody (the press, her husband -- it was not entirely clear), and suddenly the formerly conservative shirt became a made-for-social media "symbol of irony," Ms. Strasdin said.
Its status as viral messaging was only exacerbated when, in 2018, during a #MeToo controversy in Sweden, Sara Danius, the first female head of the academy that awards the Nobel Prizes, was fired over her handling of sexual assault allegations against a male colleague. In protest, women across the country marched wearing her signature "knytblus," or pussy bow.
"She turned this typical female outfit into a power suit, almost," one protester said.
'A Humble Masterpiece'
By 2022, when Kate Moss testified in the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard defamation trial in a polka-dot bow blouse and black jacket, the top had become "a palimpsest with layers of meaning," Ms. Steele said, though it was, nevertheless, "recognizable to everyone."
Which meant, said Wes Gordon, the creative director of Carolina Herrera, that it was "a permanent part of the fashion vernacular."
When Ms. Antonelli was working on the 2017 show, "Items: Is Fashion Modern?" at MoMA, and looking at the clothing that shaped culture in the 20th and 21st centuries, the litmus test that she and the other curators used was, she said: "If you closed your eyes and imagined the world without this, would you miss it?"
They ended up with 111 pieces, including bluejeans, a leather motorcycle jacket and the burkini. If she'd been able to select a few more, Ms. Antonelli said, the pussy-bow blouse would most likely have made it in.
"It has represented so much," she said. "It is what we call a humble masterpiece."
Which is why Ms. Harris's decision to make the bow blouse (and its high-neck, draped cousin, which she also favors) part of her wardrobe is so resonant. The history of the blouse allows her to play to all sides of the aisle.
She can appeal to conservatives who associate the blouse with Thatcher and Reagan and see it as a reassuringly familiar female uniform. She can situate herself in the long arc of tie-wearing presidents that came before, stretching all the way back to the founding fathers, with their own frothy blouses. And she can wink at the opposition, who may see the sartorial choice as a subversive dig at her opponent.
Whether the blouse will blossom into a full-fledged symbol of the first female president hangs on what happens on Nov. 5. But however the blouse is worn -- tied in the traditional soft way or more voluminously -- it always speaks to "the performance of power," Ms. Johnson, the designer, said. "Which, when it comes to women, is still very, very complicated."
After all, she continued, "It's a real statement to wear a bow around one's neck."

What Red Carpets Are Made For: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Once upon a time there was the Oscars: the most star-spangled red carpet event of the year. Then the Met Gala became the "Oscars of the East Coast," an even more eye-popping entrance outfit event. And now there is the Academy Museum Gala, which only four years in is starting to look a lot like ... well, the Met Gala of the West Coast.
Like the Met Gala, it is a fund-raiser for a cultural institution: in this case, the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures. Like the Met, it raises a significant amount of money: This year's take was $ 11 million. Like the Met Gala, the event itself is not televised, so what happens inside stays inside (there are honorees -- this year Paul Mescal, Quentin Tarantino and Rita Moreno -- and a performance). And like the Met, it had a red carpet to reckon with.
But while the Met itself has started to look increasingly like a competition of costume one-ups-manship, thanks to the party dress codes that change according to the exhibit being celebrated, the Academy gala seems to inspire fashion that is an ode to Old Hollywood. Cynthia Erivo, the evening's featured entertainment, crooning "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" in emerald green set the tone.
As a theme -- even an unofficial one -- it turned out to be a winner.
This kind of glamour, which hearkens back to the golden age of movies, has been missing from red carpets for awhile now, as big, celebrity-studded events became marketing exercises for fashion brands. Ones where the wildest outfits usually win the night and the crazier the look, the higher the earned media value, thanks to what has turned into the fun social media sport of judging famous people looking ridiculous.
Perhaps we were due for a realignment. Perhaps it's because the Academy gala functions as a sort of warm-up to awards season, when potential nominees can begin to position themselves as serious contenders for serious consideration. Perhaps it's because this is a night for celebrating the movies, especially the movies that become classics, so classic dress is the obvious choice. But whatever the reason, the result was practically a Rorschach test for the films that once defined the fabulousness for the watching world. And an alternative proposition for how to dress to impress.
Kaia Gerber led the way in an archival Givenchy dress by Alexander McQueen from a 1997 collection inspired by Audrey Hepburn's "My Fair Lady" ball gown, complete with beaded cap sleeves and empire waist. Also in vintage: Kim Kardashian, who channeled Jayne Mansfield in a white Thierry Mugler corset from 1998; and Ariana Grande in strapless polka dot Balmain resurfaced from a 1963 design with a Grace Kelly air. Polka dots were a general throwback thing, thanks to Eddie Redmayne's spotted jacket, Carrie Coon's halter neck Patou and Awkwafina's pearl-dotted Monique Lhuillier.
But that was just the beginning of the silver screen Easter eggs. Kendall Jenner arrived in a Marilyn Monroe blond 'do and black velvet Schiaparelli; Andra Day in epic Cecil B. DeMille-worthy hooded gold chain mail; and honoree Rita Moreno in a Fred-and-Ginger-worthy Dior white tuxedo. Not to mention all the statuesque gowns that called to mind statuettes, like Selena Gomez's sapphire Alaïa and Demi Moore's silver Prada.
Together, the clothes were a long overdue reminder that elegance can be as, well, starry a statement as sartorial extremism. In case anyone missed it, Margaret Qualley even had a bejeweled orb on her Chanel diadem. A sign, perhaps, of where all of this is, ahem, headed.

The Essential Italian Designer Returns to America: [Style Desk]

Full text: In what now seems like the Pleistocene epoch but which was just four years ago, long stretches of Madison Avenue, widely judged the premier retail rialto on the planet, were boarded up against vandals and all but abandoned.
Along with the onset of Covid-19 and its ensuing tragedies and terrors came the inevitable prophecies that certain aspects of shiny, glamorous, chic New York were gone, never to return. If the doomsayers were many, Giorgio Armani was never one. Even as the city suffered through lockdown, this onetime window dresser whose fashion designs transformed his surname into one of the most legible fashion brand names in the world, instituted a game plan.
Far from throwing in the towel on the first city outside Italy to embrace his creations, Mr. Armani and his team began laying the groundwork for a renewal of his flagship at 65th Street. That building, expanded to 12 floors in an Art Deco-ish style with eight floors of luxury residences, sits atop an expanded store selling Armani-branded furniture, cosmetics, fragrances, fine jewelry, men's and women's wear and, yes, candy.
To celebrate its opening, Mr. Armani was hardly going to settle for a ribbon-cutting. So, for his first visit to these shores in nearly a decade, the designer produced a full-scale black-tie fashion extravaganza to showcase his latest women's collection -- 95 of his drifty and bejeweled, not-entirely-contemporary looks shown at the Park Avenue Armory for 650 seated guests, with a cocktail party to follow. And then the inevitable after-party, held at the Bemelmans Bar of the Carlyle hotel, where many of those flown in by Mr. Armani for the occasion and billeted at his expense could be seen cozying up on banquettes alongside the likes of Tobey Maguire and Leonardo DiCaprio.
Inevitably, the night magnetized platoons of the actors that Mr. Armani, one of whose contributions to fashion history was the invention of celebrity red carpet dressing, routinely uniforms for these affairs. Among the boldface Armani dolls were Amanda Seyfried, Brie Larson, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Liev Schreiber, James Norton and Zachary Quinto, decked out in clothes from the brand. Cooper Koch was also on hand, flush with newfound celebrity for his turn in "Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story" on Netflix.
"There's this excitement around Armani again because people are trying to feel elegant," said Linda Fargo, the senior vice president of the women's fashion office at Bergdorf Goodman. "They're looking for clothes with a touch of feminine mystique."
As if to illustrate her point, Katie Berohn, a beauty editor of Elle, was taking selfies with friends dressed in velvet Armani-like frocks on banquettes set up, railway-station style (the theme of the evening was "Il Viaggio," meaning the journey, and it included a suspended clock and projections of steam trains), around the curtained vastness of the armory.
"A lot of young people are adopting an old-money aesthetic," said Ms. Berohn, 28. "Old Money," she added, is currently trending on TikTok.
Of designers at the show, there were Michael Kors, Daniel Lee and Willy Chavarria. "Mr. Armani inspired me as a 20-year-old wanting to get into the business," Mr. Chavarria said, adding that for a young man from an immigrant family in California's Central Valley, Mr. Armani represented a distant world. "He still inspires me now." Mr. Chavarria said. "It's what makes a night like this very tender."
If not rubbing shoulders, exactly, they shared the same rarefied air with "friends of the house," like the socialite Nicky Hilton Rothschild, who voiced a fantasy of escorting Mr. Armani on a dream date in her city. "I'd take him for tea sandwiches at Bergdorf, to the Viand coffee shop for a B.L.T. and to Rubirosa for the best pizza," Ms. Rothschild said.
Significantly, the crowd was not limited to the celebrated or well-connected. As at the store opening the previous evening, many guests were drawn from a roster of Armani clients rewarded for their loyalty to the brand. "Growing up, no one in my family could ever afford Armani," said Joe O'Neill, who in his early 20s took over a family-owned car repair shop and transformed it into the Benner's Auto Body empire.
"We would never even have thought of going into the store," he said. When flush with early success, Mr. O'Neill, who for the party was wearing a custom velvet Armani suit with embroidered lapels, finally took the plunge, he found "a world I could never have imagined," he said.
Who should walk past at that precise moment but Pamela Anderson, seemingly also surprised to find herself in the middle of a glamour mosh pit. "I suddenly got very shy," Ms. Anderson said. "I just saw Anna Wintour, and she's a very important person in this world."
A standout among the evening's guests was 4-year-old Bianca Morselli, the daughter of an employee and close friend of Mr. Armani's. "I consider her almost like my own," Mr. Armani told the Corriere della Sera newspaper last week. "And this makes me realize that I would have been a great dad."
Now 90 and a child of World War II, Mr. Armani was too busy surviving to stop and build a family, he went on to explain in an interview in which he not only came out as gay but also spoke of his father's troubling Fascist party affiliations, his start in business nearly a half century ago, the loss of his longtime lover, the architect Sergio Galeotti, to AIDS and his general distaste for the work of his competitors. (Gianni Versace partied too hard; Miuccia Prada designs for a world of her own; Calvin Klein made a career of copying Armani outright; Valentino was very "polite," as Mr. Armani said.)
Mr. Armani, who is one of Italy's most famous and wealthiest citizens, added in the startlingly frank interview (previously, the designer had declined to state his sexuality outright): "I see sacrifice as a personal victory." And it is easy to view this as a summary credo for this particular lion in the winter of his life.
Fashion, it bears remembering, is replete with Horatio Alger stories, as the "image architect" Law Roach said before the runway show began. "If you came up like I came up and went to bed hungry and cried yourself to sleep, you felt like every opportunity might be the last opportunity," he said.
As superficially disparate as the careers of the American-born stylist and the great Italian designer may seem, there are similarities in their hard-won wisdom.
"I would have never expected this," Mr. Armani replied to this reporter on Friday by text, as he flew home to Milan on his private jet. He had been asked if, growing up amid the hardships of war in Piacenza, he had imagined anything like the trajectory his life would ultimately take and, beyond that, what in hindsight he might tell the boy he was then.
"I would say this to myself," Mr. Armani replied. "Take each day one day at a time."

NEW YORK — In what now seems like the Pleistocene epoch but which was just four years ago, long stretches of Madison Avenue, widely judged the premier retail rialto on the planet, were boarded up against vandals and all but abandoned.
Along with the onset of COVID-19 and its ensuing tragedies and terrors came the inevitable prophecies that certain aspects of shiny, glamorous, chic New York were gone, never to return. If the doomsayers were many, Giorgio Armani was never one. Even as the city suffered through lockdown, this onetime window dresser, whose fashion designs transformed his surname into one of the most legible fashion brand names in the world, instituted a game plan.
Far from throwing in the towel on the first city outside Italy to embrace his creations, Armani and his team began laying the groundwork for a renewal of his flagship at 65th Street. That building, expanded to 12 floors in an art deco-ish style with eight floors of luxury residences, sits atop an expanded store selling Armani-branded furniture, cosmetics, fragrances, fine jewelry, menswear and womenswear and, yes, candy.
To celebrate its opening, Armani was hardly going to settle for a ribbon-cutting. So for his first visit to these shores in nearly a decade, the designer produced a full-scale black-tie fashion extravaganza to showcase his latest women’s collection — 95 of his drifty and bejeweled, not-entirely-contemporary looks shown at the Park Avenue Armory for 650 seated guests, with a cocktail party to follow. And then the inevitable after-party, held at the Bemelmans Bar of the Carlyle hotel, where many of those flown in by Armani for the occasion and billeted at his expense could be seen cozying up on banquettes alongside the likes of Tobey Maguire and Leonardo DiCaprio.
Inevitably, the night magnetized platoons of the actors that Armani, one of whose contributions to fashion history was the invention of celebrity red carpet dressing, routinely uniforms for these affairs. Among the boldface Armani dolls were Amanda Seyfried, Brie Larson, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Liev Schreiber, James Norton and Zachary Quinto, decked out in clothes from the brand. Cooper Koch was also on hand, flush with newfound celebrity for his turn in “Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story” on Netflix.
“There’s this excitement around Armani again because people are trying to feel elegant,” said Linda Fargo, the senior vice president of the women’s fashion office at Bergdorf Goodman. “They’re looking for clothes with a touch of feminine mystique.”
As if to illustrate her point, Katie Berohn, a beauty editor of Elle, was taking selfies with friends dressed in velvet Armani-like frocks on banquettes set up, railway-station style (the theme of the evening was “Il Viaggio,” meaning the journey, and it included a suspended clock and projections of steam trains), around the curtained vastness of the armory.
“A lot of young people are adopting an old-money aesthetic,” said Berohn, 28. “Old money,” she added, is currently trending on TikTok.
Of designers at the show, there were Michael Kors, Daniel Lee and Willy Chavarria. “Mr. Armani inspired me as a 20-year-old wanting to get into the business,” Chavarria said, adding that for a young man from an immigrant family in California’s Central Valley, Armani represented a distant world. “He still inspires me now,” Chavarria said. “It’s what makes a night like this very tender.”
If not rubbing shoulders, exactly, they shared the same rarefied air with “friends of the house,” like socialite Nicky Hilton Rothschild, who voiced a fantasy of escorting Armani on a dream date in her city. “I’d take him for tea sandwiches at Bergdorf, to the Viand coffee shop for a BLT and to Rubirosa for the best pizza,” Rothschild said.
Significantly, the crowd was not limited to the celebrated or well-connected. As at the store opening the previous evening, many guests were drawn from a roster of Armani clients rewarded for their loyalty to the brand. “Growing up, no one in my family could ever afford Armani,” said Joe O’Neill, who in his early 20s took over a family-owned car repair shop and transformed it into the Benner’s Auto Body empire.
“We would never even have thought of going into the store,” he said. When flush with early success, O’Neill, who for the party was wearing a custom velvet Armani suit with embroidered lapels, finally took the plunge, he found “a world I could never have imagined,” he said.
Who should walk past at that precise moment but Pamela Anderson, seemingly also surprised to find herself in the middle of a glamour mosh pit. “I suddenly got very shy,” Anderson said. “I just saw Anna Wintour, and she’s a very important person in this world.”
A standout among the evening’s guests was 4-year-old Bianca Morselli, the daughter of an employee and close friend of Armani’s. “I consider her almost like my own,” Armani told the Corriere della Sera newspaper last week. “And this makes me realize that I would have been a great dad.”
Now 90 and a child of World War II, Armani was too busy surviving to stop and build a family, he went on to explain in an interview in which he not only came out as gay but also spoke of his father’s troubling Fascist party affiliations; his start in business nearly a half century ago; the loss of his longtime lover, architect Sergio Galeotti, to AIDS; and his general distaste for the work of his competitors. (Gianni Versace partied too hard; Miuccia Prada designs for a world of her own; Calvin Klein made a career of copying Armani outright; Valentino was very “polite,” as Armani said.)
Armani, who is one of Italy’s most famous and wealthiest citizens, added in the startlingly frank interview (previously, the designer had declined to state his sexuality outright), “I see sacrifice as a personal victory.” And it is easy to view this as a summary credo for this particular lion in the winter of his life.
Fashion, it bears remembering, is replete with Horatio Alger stories, as “image architect” Law Roach said before the runway show began. “If you came up like I came up and went to bed hungry and cried yourself to sleep, you felt like every opportunity might be the last opportunity,” he said.
As superficially disparate as the careers of the American-born stylist and the great Italian designer may seem, there are similarities in their hard-won wisdom.
“I would have never expected this,” Armani replied to this reporter Friday by text as he flew home to Milan on his private jet. He had been asked if, growing up amid the hardships of war in Piacenza, Italy, he had imagined anything like the trajectory his life would ultimately take and, beyond that, what in hindsight he might tell the boy he was then.
“I would say this to myself,” Armani replied: “Take each day one day at a time.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Jimmy Kimmel swears he has never once asked his team to land him a lick of press -- except for the time when he begged for the chance to be featured on the cover of Costco Connection.
The host and comedian pleaded with his publicist to get him a feature. "His first question was, 'Why?"' Mr. Kimmel said. "And I told him, 'Because I love Costco."'
Mr. Kimmel has been a Costco obsessive for so long that he remembers when it merged with Price Club, a fellow wholesaler, in 1993. He does not visit for the samples. He does not go for the deals.
"I go there for relaxation," he said, describing the deep happiness he experiences when he comes home with 20 pounds of ground beef. "I don't like to run out of things," he said.
Mr. Kimmel's publicist was baffled, as was top Costco brass. "They were very confused because typically, they'll have Famous Amos on the cover of the magazine," he said.
Mr. Kimmel has led his own late-night show since 2003. He has hosted the Oscars four times. GQ and Esquire have profiled him. Still, Mr. Kimmel claims, to date, no career highlight compares with his December 2009 Costco Connection cover.
"A lot of people want to be on the cover of Vogue or Rolling Stone," he said. "For me, it's The Costco Connection."
A Print Powerhouse
The media business might be in free fall, but in Issaquah, Wash., the merriest band of magazine makers in America drives to Costco headquarters and sets about producing a monthly print periodical that is delivered to more households across the United States than Better Homes & Gardens, The New Yorker, and The Atlantic combined.
And it's growing. Each month, 15.4 million copies of Costco Connection are mailed out to "executive" members, who pay double the yearly membership fee of $ 65 for the magazine and other perks. (Another 300,000 are distributed via Costco warehouses.) Its reach is so vast that Costco Connection is now the nation's third largest magazine by print circulation, behind AARP: The Magazine and The AARP Bulletin.
You, perhaps, had no idea. But Oprah did. Ms. Winfrey has no shortage of press opportunities, but she has made time for Costco Connection. So have Tom Hanks and Bruce Springsteen, recognizing there are few more enviable placements for a person with something to sell than the cover of a publication linked to a store where nearly one-third of U.S. consumers shop.
According to Costco, Connection readers have an average household income of $ 179,000, and 92.6 percent of them own a home -- no doubt stocked with Kirkland Signature paper towels, pounds of fish sticks and leaning towers of canned tuna. Over 94 percent of Connection readers report having confidence in the magazine's content.
Freed from the pressures of the algorithm, Costco Connection's benchmarks of success are a throwback to an earlier media age. There is the fleeting high of going viral, and then there is the flexed power of landing in the mailboxes of one in 20 Americans who could unsubscribe with a few simple clicks, but choose not to.
If Costco often produces a kind of religious fervor among its shoppers, the Connection is its Scripture -- a covenant and a recruiting tool that this month trumpeted the abiding allure of Lego bricks and ran a feature on Costco-themed Halloween costumes.
A Broad Purview
The Costco Connection debuted in magazine form in 1997. (It dropped the "The" during a 2018 redesign.) From the start, the magazine was created to do what it does now: Keep shoppers coming back. Costco operates on a membership model. Its success depends on robust renewal rates.
The fact that over 90 percent of members re-up from one year to the next has perhaps more to do with the discount prices than the service journalism, but Peter Gruening, Costco's senior vice president for membership, marketing and member service centers, believes the humble Connection contributes, too.
"It is informational -- entertaining," said Mr. Gruening, 57, who, after nearly three years of incessant wheedling, agreed to an interview for this article and granted rare access to Costco headquarters.
Mr. Gruening said that although he couldn't be sure that The Connection drove people to the "executive" tier of Costco membership (though he suspects it does), he is certain those who receive it are responsive to its content. Readers tell him as much everyday.
The Connection makes its staff members' contact information readily available both on its website and in print. Mr. Gruening's email address is available there, as is a direct phone number and email address for Stephanie E. Ponder, the magazine's editorial director.
When a new issue hits mailboxes, feedback pours in. After a recent issue included a single recipe as opposed to the usual collection of dishes and snacks, Mr. Gruening was inundated with irate comments from members demanding to know where the rest had gone. "One person said: 'And the recipe was how to make a hamburger. Who doesn't know how to make a hamburger?"'
"Message received," Mr. Gruening said he remembered thinking. "Our members like to see recipes."
Ms. Ponder, 55 -- who started at the magazine as a reporter and has also edited Costco cookbooks -- said that for as long as she has worked at Costco Connection, its audience has been "vocal." She has ended up on the phone with readers who had notes about an issue featuring Jessica Simpson (her fashion line sells at Costco) and others who wanted to discuss the fact that the fruitcake had been relocated at their local warehouse.
Ms. Ponder never lacks for topics. The magazine is charged with covering the same assortment of items that stores sell -- a selection that includes not only marinara sauce and pretzels, but also solid gold bars, prefabricated saunas, Bulgarian caviar, 72-pound wheels of cheese and coffins.
Simon Holland, a humorist who beams out the occasional Costco-related musing to his 762,000 Instagram followers, said he discovered Costco Connection after assuming it was a catalog and tossing the first 20 or so copies he received. But he eventually picked up an issue and came across a travel guide for Napa (Costco has a travel department that sells vacation packages) and a feature on sports (Costco sells dart boards and golf simulators). He liked it.
"I've been kind of into it ever since," Mr. Holland said. The magazine charms him for the same reason that Costco is his favorite store: Who knows what a person might find in there?
Mr. Holland, 46, subscribed to Sports Illustrated well into his 30s. He grew up on paper-and-ink magazines, he said, and the state of the current newsstand depresses him.
"You buy a magazine at a store, and it's, like, $ 37, and it's got four articles in there," he said. "I mean, it's not good." Besides Costco Connection, he receives only The New Yorker at home. "I like being able to read just a little snippet of something and then put it down and come back later," he continued.
It's All About the Shoppers
Many articles in Costco Connection feature members of the club -- the better to enhance the sense of pride and belonging that Costco aims to foster. Paula Skaggs and David Liebenson appeared in one recent issue, after getting engaged at their local Chicago-area warehouse in November 2023. (Mr. Liebenson coordinated the proposal with the customer service team, thanking "Debbie in Membership" in particular for her help.)
After celebrating with Costco's signature food court combo of a hot dog and soda, Ms. Skaggs, a writer, shared the news and was told in no uncertain terms by several of her loved ones that she "had to get this in Costco Connection," Ms. Skaggs recalled. She emailed the magazine and heard back a few months later that the piece would run in the September issue.
"We were thrilled," Ms. Skaggs said, likening the glamour of the feature to an appearance in a glossier title. "It felt like our very own Devil Wears Prada."
News of the couple's nuptials reached Susan Korn, designer of the label Susan Alexandra. In a photo with the piece, Ms. Skaggs can be seen holding one of Ms. Korn's bags.
Ms. Korn wondered whether she should trumpet the placement, given that Costco trades in discounts and Ms. Korn is protective of the luster of her line. "You never want to associate your brand with being on sale," she explained. "But then I was like: 'Wait, this is incredible. Costco is probably the most beloved brand in the entire world."'
Ms. Korn posted a photo of the magazine on Instagram. Soon, she said she was fielding emails from relatives, friends and "people in the suburbs" who had received the issue at home. Most of them had never seemed interested in the more exclusive press Ms. Korn secured.
"The goal I have as a designer is to be far-reaching and to touch people outside of the New York bubble," she said. "Now knowing what I know, I'm like, 'Can we get ad space?"' (She cannot. Kathi Tipper-Holgersen, The Connection's publishing advertising manager, explained that advertisers must be Costco suppliers.)
"I think we have gotten more congratulations about being in Costco Connection than we have on the actual wedding," Ms. Skaggs said.
A Stable Job in Journalism
Over the summer, with the September issue long closed, Ms. Ponder held one of her regular production meetings on Zoom (to accommodate The Connection's British and Canadian teams). During the meeting, she tracked progress on half a dozen coming issues of the magazine and solicited updates on articles on topics including plantar fasciitis, candy jewelry, butternut squash recipes and Theraflu.
She would later pass approved text up through a chain of readers until it reached the desk of Ron M. Vachris, who was named Costco's third-ever chief executive in January. Mr. Vachris is now responsible for almost 900 warehouses worldwide and the over 300,000 people who work across them. Still, he would make time for plantar fasciitis: There isn't a word in Costco Connection that he does not sign off on.
In the meantime, Ms. Ponder invited Chris Rusnak, a graphic designer, to share wildlife photos he had taken the previous weekend and wished the team a good Uncommon Instrument Awareness Day, National Avocado Day and National Mutt Day.
That spirit of enthusiasm and optimism is something Steven Lait is still getting used to. A refugee from the newspaper trenches, Mr. Lait was a cartoonist at The Oakland Tribune, in California, for almost two decades before he relocated to Washington and was stunned to discover the existence of "an actual publishing department that's got funding," he said. He was hired as a graphic designer for The Connection in 2011, which means he is "just getting over being the new person," he said.
He means this. There is now one newer hire -- a single staff member who joined the team since Mr. Lait did. When people leave, it's usually to retire.
Mr. Lait is an exception for his experience outside of Costco. Several of his co-workers started where Mr. Vachris did, on the warehouse floor, as forklift operators and baggers. "There was so much tumultuousness about jobs in newspapers," Mr. Lait said. "Being here at a place like this -- it's stable. It's just so nice."
But even the sturdiest institutions must adapt with the times. The Connection is treasured, but the cost of producing it is rising. Paper is more expensive. Postage is not cheap.
"We have no plans to discontinue the magazine," Mr. Gruening said. "But we would like to expand digital and grow that circulation." He has at least converted Dorothy Strakele, 66, who works as the magazine's digital coordinator and who sees herself as an ambassador for the wonders of the internet, pushing her co-workers to provide compelling visual content to run with their stories.
"I'm like, 'Give me a video, I need a video,"' Ms. Strakele said. Mr. Gruening noted that The Connection has a more navigable website than it used to and puts much of its content online for free (although readership is modest compared with its overwhelming print circulation).
Digital ambitions aside, Connection originalists still savor it in its printed form. Mr. Kimmel lamented that ever since he was awarded a lifetime executive membership, his own subscription to Costco Connection seems to have lapsed. Might a reporter be able to put in a good word with the circulation desk? "I would like to be on the mailing list again," Mr. Kimmel said. He needed them to know: "One of your most enthusiastic customers would like to get his magazine."

Full text: Prada and Axiom Space unveiled their NASA spacesuits, in the most far-out collaboration yet.
In its quest to shape the aesthetics of everything, the fashion world has extended its glossy, well-decorated tentacles into all sorts of unexpected areas: sports, film, hotels, furniture, publishing. And, as of Wednesday, space.
The cosmos is not just the final frontier, apparently. It's the final fashion frontier.
Or so said Lorenzo Bertelli, the chief marketing officer of Prada, before the unveiling of its most recent collaboration: the Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Unit spacesuit, otherwise known as the spacesuit that NASA's astronauts will wear when they walk on the moon during the Artemis III mission in 2026.
"It is a revolution in the design of spacesuits," said Russell Ralston, the executive vice president for extravehicular activity for Axiom Space, the company responsible for the suit. It's sort of like the Lamborghini of spacesuits: streamlined, motile, kind of sporty (relatively speaking).
What it is not, however, is an obvious runway brand extension.
The white suit -- the final version of a prototype first teased last year when it had a dark covering to hide its outer layer -- with articulated armadillolike gray patches at the knees and elbows, a cropped top, selectively placed red stripes and glossy silver visor, has more in common, at least at first glance, with previous spacesuits than with anything seen on the Prada catwalk.
Even if the most recent Prada show did feature the sorts of face protectors that called to mind sci-fi royalty, and silver foil skirts with giant comet-shaped cutouts. Even if fashion has long had a fascination with the romance and fantasy of space exploration -- ever since the designers André Courrèges and Paco Rabanne made orbital style a signature in the 1960s.
Even if it started "as a sort of joke," said Mr. Bertelli, the man behind the partnership (and the elder of Miuccia Prada and Patrizio Bertelli's two sons). A few years ago, he said, he was thinking about how to leverage the 20 years of research and billions of euros of investment Prada had devoted to its Luna Rossa America's Cup team and related Linea Rossa apparel line. As it happens, Luna Rossa means red moon, which led him to thoughts of space, which led him to ... Mars.
"But then I realized the moon was much closer," Mr. Bertelli said.
"Our group has disrupted a lot in the past," he continued. "Maybe this is another opportunity where we could disrupt a bit." So he reached out to Axiom, which had just bid for the NASA contract.
Axiom was "a little surprised," Mr. Bertelli said.
Still, Mr. Ralston said, Axiom quickly realized that a partnership with a fashion brand "actually makes a lot of sense, because a spacesuit is a unique thing.
"It blends science and engineering but also art, all crafted around the human body," he continued. "The backpack is very rigid, but the suit portion has to be flexible. It has to accommodate men and women of all different sizes. It has to move. It has to look good."
Also, he said, "it's a symbol. It's an icon of our society." It's the part of space travel to which most consumers relate.
And the leap from sports to space is less dramatic than it may initially appear, Mr. Bertelli said. Past Prada employees who worked on Linea Rossa have moved on to jobs at SpaceX and Boeing. At the same time, the brand's expertise in crafting made-to-order, personalized garments proved to be an asset when crafting made-to-order, personalized spacesuits.
About 10 Prada employees worked full time on the spacesuit, traveling back and forth between Milan and Houston, where Axiom is based, focused primarily on new materials and sewing techniques. Though the final design prioritizes function and technical specifications over style, there are Easter eggs for Prada devotees, including the carefully placed red stripes, which nod to the Linea Rossa logo (and serve to distinguish the commander from the rest of the crew; other crew members would wear stripes of a different color). Mrs. Prada and Raf Simons, the brand's co-creative directors, said they were particularly excited about that dual symbolism.
Indeed, if part of the goal is getting more people excited about space exploration, tapping into the fashion world is one way to do it. That goes some way to explaining why, for example, Axiom enlisted Esther Marquis, the costume designer for the Apple TV+ series "For All Mankind," to help make the covering for its last prototype; why Richard Branson worked with Under Armour on his Virgin Galactic uniforms; and why Elon Musk worked with Jose Fernandez, the "Batman v Superman" and "Avengers" costume designer, on SpaceX uniforms. Working with Prada simply takes the pop culture connection to the next, potentially commercial, level.
(Though there will be an American flag patch and one for Axiom's trademark on the finished product, there will not be a signature Prada triangle.)
"This is really, I think, the opportunity to make space closer to people," Mr. Bertelli said. "Sometimes, a lot of stuff starts as a kind of a game, and then it becomes something more. There is a risk, but we take that risk." Mr. Bertelli, a former racecar driver who joined the family business in 2017, has a visceral familiarity with risk.
Axiom and Prada see this as the first step in a potential new business opportunity. "The space economy is not something just for companies that make rockets," Mr. Ralston said. "In the future, I'm 100 percent sure we're going to have more and more business-use cases where we need to go in space." And all of those people involved in all of those business-use cases will need something to wear.
Certainly, both sides are committed to continuing the partnership. "We have also been studying the design of other complementary objects for the mission, which will be unveiled in the coming months," Mrs. Prada and Mr. Simons wrote in an email.
Mr. Bertelli said: "This is the beginning. What we are going to try now is test ourselves in this environment. If we see that we are good enough, it could be a strategic asset. It's not going to change our profit and loss or our top line for the moment. But you never know if you never start." One small step for man, one giant leap for fashionkind.

Full text: More than any other artist working today, Theaster Gates -- ceramist, urbanist, archivist, sculptor -- has earned the title "multidisciplinary."
THE BUREAUCRAT
THEASTER GATES IS the kind of artist whose work is perpetually on view somewhere in the world. When we met for the first time, in May at his studio in Chicago's Greater Grand Crossing neighborhood, he had just returned from opening exhibitions at the Mori Art Museum in Tokyo and the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston. His practice is all-encompassing. He is known for installations that use supplies and furnishings from old buildings, paying tribute to their past lives -- as homes, stores, churches. These installations serve double or even triple duty: They are works of art in themselves, but they can also become venues for parties or performances. His sculptures and paintings employ construction materials like wood, rubber and roofing tar. He's a master ceramist and a musician and singer who performs with his experimental group, the Black Monks, in which he's known as the Abbot.
For years, Gates has acquired archives, and he sees their stewardship as integral to his work. Many preserve Black American cultural memory, like the roughly 20,000-volume library that once belonged to the Johnson Publishing Company, publisher of Ebony and Jet, and the 5,000-record vinyl collection of Frankie Knuckles, the Chicago D.J. at whose late '70s parties house music was born. He is currently advising an arts-led redevelopment project in Philadelphia and an initiative to preserve Houston's Freedmen's Town, a historically Black district in the city's Fourth Ward. He chairs the diversity council at Prada, where he runs a mentorship program for designers of color, and he is developing partnerships in Japan with small family-owned businesses to produce incense and sake. In his studio, a 30,000-square-foot compound that occupies two former factories that he bought in 2019, he served me tea from Horii Shichimeien, a venerable Kyoto maker, in a stoneware cup.
In his hometown, Gates is recognized as an entrepreneur who buys and restores properties on Chicago's South Side. He puts these properties to unusual, sometimes less than practical use. The core of his holdings is a quiet half-mile stretch of South Dorchester Avenue, where he started acquiring run-down houses in 2006. He filled some with archives -- thousands of art books purchased from a shuttered bookshop; LPs from a defunct record store. One house became his residence.
Gates's business dealings and art making are not at odds: Salvage from the buildings goes into his art installations; proceeds from his art sales fund his building renovations and community programs. But they also stem from shared soil -- his upbringing as the son of a roofer on Chicago's West Side, his training as an urban planner -- and commingle in his projects to the point where it would be artificial to separate them. Gates himself draws no distinction: He hopes to demonstrate, he told me, "an open model for what an artist can be."
Gates took a highly unusual path into the art world and, as an artist, though inspired by multiple movements and histories, he's created something sui generis. He rebuffs categories like "social practice" -- jargon for participative art with civic goals -- but cites predecessors like Donald Judd, who made furniture as well as geometric objects, and the Fluxus movement, with its interest in everyday materials and spontaneous performances. He's an inheritor of the legacy of Marcel Duchamp and his readymades, mass-produced and utilitarian objects that the French artist displayed as art. In a sense, Gates has scaled up the method. Duchamp's readymades include a snow shovel and a bicycle wheel; Gates's are old factories and homes. To some extent, he doesn't think of them as property at all. "The beauty of these buildings gives me a tremendous amount of joy," he said. "It's an artistic idiom of its own."
A bureaucrat before he was ever an artist, Gates worked as an art planner for the Chicago Transit Authority from 2000 to 2005. After that, he began investing in Grand Crossing when he moved to the South Side to become an arts administrator at the University of Chicago, where he's now a professor. "The neighborhood had stigma, but the people were great and interesting," he said. He recognized the terrain: Black neighborhoods that faced disinvestment and crime but were once self-contained and self-possessed -- places where, he said, "the Black doctor and lawyer and bus driver and maid were all on the same block, and they all went to the same church." By revitalizing these quotidian spaces -- homes, a bank, a school, hardware stores that he has bought, often with their contents, when they were going out of business -- he is summoning a kind of utopian memory in the service of new functions. "It's not just the bourgeois dimension of 'He owns a building,"' Gates's friend the artist and filmmaker Arthur Jafa, 63, told me. "It's more about a transgression of some primary interdictions with regard to Black people, which is that you cannot manage material. You will be material. But to manage material is a whole other thing." Through his investments in Grand Crossing -- even when they take unconventional forms -- Gates sees himself as helping Chicago to "hold its Black self together."
He took me down a side street edged by commuter rail tracks where in 2021 he opened Kenwood Gardens, a sanctuary with lawns, wildflowers and a pavilion that hosts house-music parties in the summer. It occupies 13 lots that were in decline -- notorious, he said, for burned-out cars and prostitution. A wall encircling the garden is made partly from bricks that he saved from St. Laurence Catholic Church, a neighborhood anchor that the archdiocese sold and that was razed in 2014.
"When I built the perimeter wall, I didn't own the property," Gates said. "I built the wall to stop the bad stuff." He then bought the lots, many loaded with tax arrears. "The city was quite happy to help us negotiate the land sales," he said, "because they would finally have a steward." Building his unauthorized wall, Gates said, was a case of tactical urbanism, as citizen initiatives that bypass city bureaucracy or goad it to action are called in the planning business.
Gates is compact, with a shaved head and salt-and-pepper beard, and he dresses comfortably in collarless shirts, loose pants and leather loafers. When he gets excited about a topic, he can take on the tone of a minister addressing his congregation. He is too obviously sincere, even earnest, to come across as an operator. And yet he has both an aptitude and an appetite for policy and negotiations. In a famous deal, he purchased the former Stony Island State Savings Bank, a 1920s edifice facing demolition, from the city in 2012 for $ 1 and the commitment to restore it -- which he funded in part by selling salvaged marble slabs at Art Basel for $ 5,000 each. It now hosts collections, exhibitions and events. "You learn policy, you know the rules, you play with it," he said. "Then you can make a case." Romi Crawford, 58, a professor of visual and critical studies at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, described how Gates enfolds transactions into his art as "contract aesthetics." Gates has fielded periodic criticism that he is too amenable to the rich and powerful. He rejects this, returning to the word "tactical." "If you're talking about protesting, there are people who are better protesters," he said. "If you're talking about getting [things] done in the city, I can do it better than most artists. I can do it better than most developers."
We arrived at the bank building. Outside was the gazebo where the 12-year-old Tamir Rice was shot dead by a police officer in Cleveland in 2014; working with Rice's mother, Gates brought the structure to Chicago to save it from demolition. (It belongs back in Cleveland, he's said, but its temporary care is his "duty as a Black man," he told the Guardian in 2019.) Inside the bank some 50 people had gathered for happy hour -- including Frederick Dunson, the president of the Frankie Knuckles Foundation; Yaw Agyeman, one of the Black Monks, who performed with the musician Sharon Udoh; and the D.J. Celeste Alexander, a house-music veteran.
Gates greeted the assembled in his preacher mode. "I was telling the sisters in the congregation, 'I want to be free from the things that hinder me,"' he said. He likes his gatherings "underprogrammed," like his buildings. "There is absolutely no agenda," he continued. All he wanted was someplace "where we can just be together."
THE TRAVELER
GATES RECENTLY TURNED 51; a Virgo, he notes. He still lives on the South Side, although now in an apartment closer to Hyde Park. He travels constantly. He has never married or had children, but he is in a relationship that he and his partner prefer to keep out of the spotlight. "I have love in my life and I'm extremely happy," he said.
He was born in 1973, the sole boy after eight girls. He describes a close and dense family life in the East Garfield Park neighborhood on the West Side shaped by the labor and small property acquisitions of his father, Theaster Gates Sr., and by the devout values of his mother, Lorine, a schoolteacher. His parents had bought their four-apartment home amid late '60s white flight for $ 23,000, paying installments to the seller, who eventually forgave the balance.
Gates toggled between worlds, as he has done ever since. He was bused to the North Side starting in fifth grade, then attended Lane Tech, a selective public high school; in that respect, he told me, "I'm a child of integration and affirmative action." In the neighborhood, he said, "every summer, more of my friends were in gangs." He was different: churchy, charismatic, coddled by his big sisters. In lieu of an allowance, his father paid him to help on roofing jobs and fixing buildings. "I was around serial entrepreneurship and prayerful way-making," Gates told me. "It wasn't a way to get rich. It was a way to look out for your family and have control of the emotional environment, not have an outside force telling you what to do."
Summers in Mississippi reinforced that idea. In a classic Great Migration pattern, his parents had come up from the Delta -- his father from Yazoo City, his mother from Humphreys County nearby. Most of her siblings remained there, and Gates would spend summers with his uncle Herbert, who owned a 500-acre farm, growing corn, cotton and soy beans and raising cattle and hogs. It was an education in the land and its stakes: Other Black families lived on the farm -- "The only word we have for it is 'sharecroppers,"' Gates said -- and the surrounding white farmers were trying to squeeze Herbert out. Mississippi, Gates said, is where he learned to appreciate scale: "I understand square blocks because I understand acres." It's also a recurring reference in his art. For a 2022 exhibition of contemporary takes on the Great Migration at the Mississippi Museum of Art, he designed an installation called "Double Wide" inspired by the trailer on his uncle's land that was a candy store by day and a juke joint after dark.
Arriving at Iowa State University in 1992, Gates decided to major in urban planning (in which he'd later earn a master's degree) with a double minor in studio art and religious studies. He learned about nonconformists like Samuel Mockbee, the architect who in 1993 co-founded the Rural Studio program, known for designing homes from recycled materials in the Alabama Black Belt. On the side, he discovered pottery, becoming close with a ceramics professor, Ingrid Lilligren, who would remain a mentor.
After college, Gates won a scholarship to study for a master's degree in traditional African religion at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. Then, following a brief stint in Seattle, he returned to Chicago in 1999 when he was hired by the transit authority. After hours, he'd rent kilns at the Lillstreet Art Center. He wanted, he said, to become good at something. "I went to my day job, and I would come home, go to the studio and make pots," he said. "That unromantic development was very helpful for me. I was gaining skill in darkness, with no one interested."
Once, he recalled, he made three soda-fired bowls to sell at the DuSable Museum's market devoted to Black artisans. A customer offered $ 75, less than Gates thought they were worth in view of his costs, leading to an epiphany. "I decided I would no longer sell the vessel," he said. "If you believe in my world, then you might get a vessel free. But believing in my world is a greater investment than the cost of a bowl."
In 2004, Gates took an unpaid leave and traveled to Japan to attend a summer workshop in Tokoname, a coastal city in the central region and one of the country's designated Six Ancient Kiln towns, with a nearly thousand-year ceramics history. He lived with a host family and learned from master potters. "I wouldn't call it instruction, though instruction was part of it," he said. "I got something more akin to what the Bible would call impartation, where it felt like I was touched or moved." He added: "It was permission to be a better potter, and that's really what I needed."
In the United States, his instruction on ceramics history had privileged European and American decorative arts. Japan, to which he'd return many times, presented a rich ceramics tradition. He was particularly interested in the Mingei movement, which started in the 1920s and celebrated the beauty of everyday craft objects and advocated support for folk artisans, joining Buddhist precepts with a critique of industrial mass production. The potters Kanjiro Kawai and Shoji Hamada, who were key Mingei figures, embraced solid, rustic forms, local clays and natural glazes, and welcomed imperfections in the finished work.
All of this gave Gates an idea that would prove pivotal for his own development as an artist. What if, he imagined, following World War II, a Japanese potter had found his way to the United States and landed in Mississippi, drawn to its soil and possibilities? What if he had married a Black woman there, perhaps a civil rights activist? What if, years later, they had died in a crash, leaving behind his body of work?
At his first major exhibition, at the Hyde Park Art Center in Chicago in 2007, Gates served a soul food dinner for 50 on his stoneware plates that he attributed to the potter, whom he named Shoji Yamaguchi in tribute to Hamada. The guests were a mix of wealthy Chicagoans, artists, South Side neighbors. He hired a biracial actor to play Yamaguchi's son. Only later would Gates reveal that the work was his own.
Gates's friend Hamza Walker, 58, the director of the alternative art space the Brick in Los Angeles who was living in Chicago at the time, told me that back then Gates called himself a "confused potter-performer." But if anything, the show, titled "Plate Convergence," proved his seriousness about ceramics. And it revealed Gates, suddenly, as a full-fledged conceptual artist, not averse to a little sleight of hand. Yet far from a gimmick, the story of Yamaguchi would blossom into a larger synthesis of Black and Japanese folk aesthetics that he now calls Afro-Mingei. "I imagined Yamaguchi as a speculative theory," Gates told me. Afro-Mingei, he added, "has been a self-fulfilling proposition."
THE HOST
THIS PAST JULY, I met Gates in Arles, France, where he'd organized the Black Artists Retreat, a gathering that he has hosted annually at various venues since 2013, and that overlapped this year with his exhibition at LUMA Arles, a sprawling art complex in a former railway yard.
In its early years, BAR, held at Gates's studio in Chicago, was a chance for established and rising, mostly Black American, artists to connect more or less privately. It grew and eventually traveled -- to the Park Avenue Armory in New York for a large, semipublic edition in 2019, and to the Serpentine Pavilion in London in 2022. But in Arles it tacked small again, with some 40-odd artists. Most were European, recommended by the London-based curators Jareh Das and Bianca A. Manu; several barely knew Gates at all. His underprogrammed spirit was back: loose scheduling, good meals, dancing. The French Ghanaian artist Eden Tinto Collins, attending BAR for the first time, told me the vibe felt like "faire foyer" -- creating a hearth or home.
At LUMA, Gates had set up a pottery workshop where he and a small team were making works in public to exhibit on-site -- a kind of accumulative installation that would fill the hangarlike space by the show's closing in early November. They included tall, urnlike vessels and abstract, almost gnomic clay works. "It's very ancestral," the Nigerian artist Ranti Bam, 42, said.
Maja Hoffmann, 68, the Swiss contemporary-art collector and LUMA's founder, had invested in two kilns -- including an anagama (a Japanese "cave kiln"), hand-built on the grounds of La Chassagnette, the restaurant that she owns in the countryside. There, at rosé hour, Gates gathered his guests to witness him unloading the anagama after its inaugural, seven-day-long firing. The kiln, 20 feet deep with an arched fire mouth, resembled a brick dragon. Gates, in blue workwear, sang a gospel tune as pots of various shapes came out, glazed by the ash in ocher, gray and green hues: "You who are weary, stop by the potter's house. ... The potter wants to put you back together again." There were broken shards, too, which he extracted with equal reverence.
During the early years of Gates's rise, his ceramics were largely unknown, eclipsed by his property acquisitions and works like "Civil Tapestries" -- wall-mounted sculptures made from strips of decommissioned fire hoses -- and his so-called tar paintings, created from roofing materials in homage to his father. Hoffmann, now a major patron, met him in 2013 at Art Basel, around his installation of a sloping wood surface covered with tar. "I saw him more as a carpenter, a roofer," she told me. "I didn't realize the ceramics thing. And then we went to Chicago and I understood."
In fact, he had been making ceramics all along, including in his own anagama in Chicago. At his studio there, Gates had shown me rooms of ceramics and pointed out techniques -- cobalt-and-red iron shino glazes, mustard washes, manganese stains. There were vessels and abstract sculptures, utilitarian black bricks and even figurative warrior protectors inspired by African statuary. His recent exhibitions have increasingly featured pottery. "Black Vessel," at Gagosian gallery in New York in 2020, included a room of ceramics, many set directly on the floor. His 2022 New Museum survey in New York, "Young Lords and Their Traces," whose signal theme was mourning -- for his mother and father, and for his friends the curator Okwui Enwezor and the writer bell hooks -- made space for a large display of ceramics, as well.
His first craft, Gates suggested, had forced him to work with rigor at times when his career felt too permissive. "After you get to a certain point of ascendancy in the art world, you're just making up your own truth," he said. "You don't have the burden of people even liking you. You're entering a free fall." He added: "I'm after a world of rules. I want somebody to say, 'Your tea bowl is too heavy, Theaster. You can trim a little bit more off the foot. It doesn't have the depth and dimension that it should. Keep working."'
THE STUDENT
IN AUGUST, I visited Gates in Japan, where he's been spending more time of late, collaborating with other artists and craftspeople. "I started building an intentional artisanal network," he said. We were on the mezzanine of Farmoon, a tea salon and chef's table on a side street in Kyoto. It was hot out, and the chef Masayo Funakoshi had sent up corn ice cream with tomato-infused orange blossom water, ricotta and lemon basil. Funakoshi had cooked a meal at BAR in Arles with the chef Armand Arnal; now she was preparing sweets for a tea ceremony to be held the next day inside Gates's exhibition in Tokyo and led by Reijiro Izumi, an heir of the centuries-old Urasenke tea ceremony tradition. For the show, Gates also commissioned 30,000 bricks from the Mizuno Seitoen Lab, a company in Tokoname, plus sake from a Kyoto-based company.
We took the Shinkansen train to Nagoya, then drove to Tokoname on the Chita Peninsula. In the Meiji era, the town's ceramics tradition, its robust high-iron-content clay and harbor location had made it a manufacturing hub for earthenware sewer pipes. But the transition to industrially manufactured metal pipes undercut Tokoname's clay-based economy. Craft ceramics, however, endured.
The town gave off an air of permanent quiet. "When I go back to Tokoname, it's like going back to the West Side of Chicago," Gates said. "What's there for me are memories and ghosts. Places that used to be open. Clay supply stores. People's studios that, when you walk along the pottery path, you could just stop in and say hello." Japan's aging population has meant fewer successors and more empty workshops. "In a place that's as culturally significant as Tokoname, there's a need for a kind of cultural infrastructure," he said.
Not long ago, Gates took over a seven-building compound in town and, in 2022, as part of the Aichi Triennale, he welcomed visitors to a listening room there. "I didn't want to bring pots to Tokoname; that would be like bringing sand to the beach," he said. "So I decided to bring my other wheels" -- turntables, plus the record collection of Marva Lee Pitchford-Jolly, the Chicago potter who died in 2012. "She always wanted to go to Japan," he said. "And so I brought her albums so that she could be here with me."
Driving up the hill, Gates spotted a neighbor, Mr. Matsushita, 66, a bonsai artist and potter, shirtless in the window of his ground-floor study. He invited us in. Around his desk were his plants and writings, along with old fliers for exhibitions involving the German social-sculpture artist Joseph Beuys.
"Matsushita-san might be one of the greatest living thinkers in Tokoname," Gates told me. "Just that kind of wizardlike intentionality. He takes a pine wick that's growing in the asphalt, pulls it up, builds its root, plants it in his pot. That's a beautiful thing."
Through a back door lay a vast ceramics workshop with two kilns. "In Tokoname there's no wind," Matshushita said. "For me, Theaster brings the wind." He added, "It's not easy to live freely like Theaster."
In Tokyo at the Mori Art Museum, wall text by Gates explained that Afro-Mingei was "a speculation." In Mingei's assertion of pride in folk craft, Gates recognized an impulse that felt similar to the Black Is Beautiful movement of the 1960s and '70s. But the show was also his expression of thanks for Japan and its potters. "I'm a different artist in Japan," he told me. "And I love myself here."
The exhibition mixed familiar forms from Gates's repertoire -- ceramics, tar paintings, salvaged-wood installations -- with neon sculptures and slate boards marked with names of Black and Japanese artists and movements. There were shelves laden with thousands of small sake jars. Most strikingly, on racks of wooden shelving he'd placed one of his readymade archives -- almost the entire body of work that Yoshihiro Koide, a Tokoname potter, left behind at his death in 2022. The nearly 20,000 ceramic pieces, many wrapped in paper or contained in boxes, were a monument to labor and to the duty of care.
The exhibition's organizers, Mami Kataoka and Hirokazu Tokuyama, had wanted to show a selection of these works in vitrines, Gates said. He insisted otherwise. "They were being museological," he said. "I was being propagandistic. I'm trying to show you a world, and you can't show a world through four objects, or taking the best specimens and presenting them. If you want to have a Theaster show, you bring all 20,000 things."
But despite the busy world Gates has built for himself, its center is paradoxically calm. At the studio in Chicago, I'd been struck by the quiet. His operation has downsized, he said -- from 65 employees at its peak, around 2016, which he admitted overwhelmed him, to just 15.
Next to go might be his collection of buildings, though it could take a while. "I did not attempt to amass a real estate holdings situation," he said. "I was simply trying to prove the point that artists can change a place." Now, he added, "I have to learn how to shed. In the same way that I spent two decades accumulating, I feel like I'm going to spend two decades shrinking." At that point, he fantasized, we might find him in Kenwood Gardens, giving tea bowls away.
"As a 30-year-old, buying a building meant something," he said. "It meant, 'I'm a man, I'm a mature person, I can stand on my own feet.' The second building was like, 'I can have a studio, I can contribute to a block, I can be useful to my people.' Now I can be useful by giving it away. I don't need any footprint." The goal for the next stage of his career, he said, "will be that no one needs me anymore."

Full text: No other fashion designer today blurs the lines between the avant-garde and the commercial as imaginatively, or ruthlessly, as Jonathan Anderson, the creative director of Loewe.
JONATHAN ANDERSON WAS on an Italian movie set when he started to question everything. It was the spring of 2023, and the fashion designer was watching a playback on a monitor at Cinecittà, the film studio on the outskirts of Rome where he and the director Luca Guadagnino had been working on an adaptation of "Queer," the autobiographical novel by William S. Burroughs, written in the 1950s but published three decades later. Anderson, the Northern Irish creative director of Loewe and the founder of his own clothing line, JW Anderson, was overseeing the costumes. The two friends had worked together before on Guadagnino's "Challengers" (2024), about a love triangle set in the world of competitive tennis, but their second feature collaboration, which follows a gay American expat, played by Daniel Craig, from midcentury Mexico City into the Ecuadorean jungle on a search for ayahuasca, was more ambitious, requiring period clothing for hundreds of actors and extras. As they reviewed the footage, Anderson, who had stepped into the frame to fix something on Craig's costume, realized that he'd been captured onscreen. What he saw disturbed him. The prodigy with tousled blond hair who'd started his brand in 2008 at age 23 had been replaced by a man on the verge of middle age. But it wasn't just that he looked somewhat disheveled: Anderson had been so busy working that he'd lost track of time. "I was like, who is that person?" he recalls thinking. "And what have I done in the last 10 years?"
On a crisp morning this past February, Anderson is recounting the experience in his townhouse in the East London borough of Hackney. Although he's warm and self-mocking, he gives the impression that he's never not at least a little on edge. "When you're working all the time, you end up being addicted to the next show," he says. "You're so busy outdoing yourself that you don't realize what you've done." The early light cuts across a Le Corbusier stool, a white linen sofa by Axel Vervoordt and a pair of Georgian-style yellow armchairs in the living room. "You're trying to be a normal person," he adds. "And people are expecting you to be happy all the time and have an idea. But sometimes you just don't."
Anderson's restlessness seems particularly intense right now, perhaps because it's the year he turns 40, or because, despite having more than a few fears, the thing that scares him most is feeling truly seen. "I'm more of a voyeur," he says. "I've never wanted to be like, 'Here I am!"' And yet, for the past couple of years, it's been difficult to avoid hearing his name or Loewe's, which, until quite recently, most people probably couldn't pronounce. (In 2018, the brand released a video of models struggling to get it right; it's "Lo-WEH-vay," the actor and filmmaker Dan Levy tells his co-star Aubrey Plaza in a recent promotional short.) In February of last year, Anderson was in a motel in the Arizona desert dressing Rihanna for her Super Bowl halftime show. The performer, who used the occasion to announce her second pregnancy, wore a red Loewe boiler suit and leather breastplate. A few months later, Beyoncé kicked off her Renaissance World Tour in a bespoke Loewe bodysuit embellished with strategically placed sequined hands. And this past spring, the "Challengers" press tour felt like one long fashion show, with all three lead actors -- Mike Faist, Josh O'Connor and Zendaya -- wearing Loewe outfits, including, in Zendaya's case, shoes made from 3-D-printed tennis balls. "Actors are strange people in a good way," says Anderson, who once trained to be one himself. "They're like vessels. You can pour in whatever you want."
The same might be said of his clothes. If some designers have become famous for introducing a new silhouette or landing on a signature look and then finding countless ways to reiterate it, Anderson has a reputation for being more mercurial. With each collection, he's either adding a new layer to an existing idea (a mesh slip dress with a balloon motif one season; shoes made of real balloons the next) or rejecting it outright. His take on fashion isn't exactly theatrical -- some of the garments can be quite subtle -- but his clothes tend to come with an element of performance. As the actress Greta Lee, who has appeared in multiple Loewe campaigns, says, Anderson's creations have a way of activating "an elevated version of your essence."
Two days from now, he'll present his fall 2024 JW Anderson women's collection at a gymnasium in London's Marylebone neighborhood. "The show we're working on is very British woman in suburbia," says Anderson, who's in the process of rejecting his louder recent offerings and the attention they received. "When it gets too much, my natural reaction is to go for a silent year." As he sets down a pot of coffee on an 18th-century oak dining table in his kitchen, he makes a face that reappears, not infrequently, whenever he's feeling agitated: a look of dread cut with a smile, a sort of breaking of the fourth wall that indulges his neuroses while also attempting to undermine them.
In conversation, Anderson can be an exuberant and compelling catastrophizer, and the more time one spends observing him, the more one starts to feel that his own relationship to fashion might be read as a kind of performance, too: At the end of his runway shows, when he emerges to take a bow, it's always with his head down and shoulders slumped, almost as if he's been forced into receiving applause. Designers, he once told me, are "kind of biblically hated," and his view of the entire industry can seem equally bleak, even if he's stating it for effect: The magazines that once held such sway are increasingly irrelevant; connoisseurship is dead; everything is generic. But rather than dispirit him, all of this only pushes him to fight harder. "I feel like we're in this amazing moment where it's going to be survival of the fittest," he says. His voice has intensified into a high-pitched whisper, every word delivered as if it were part of a lurid blind item. He smiles again.
His ambition is clear: He's determined to become the world's best living fashion designer. What's sometimes murkier is why he wants this. "I'm sure people would say that I'm arrogant," he says. His goals, though, are simple and practical. "Bag sales need to get to here; the stores need to be like this. But these are just actions," he says. "The big thing is, 'What am I getting out of it creatively?"' Another question might be: How long can he keep it all up?
IT'S BEEN JUST over a decade since Anderson was hired by LVMH to revive Loewe, a fashion house established in Madrid in 1846 as a leather-making collective. When the French conglomerate, which also has a stake in JW Anderson, fully acquired Loewe in 1996, clothing was responsible for about 10 percent of sales, which hovered around $ 200 million. For four years beginning in 1997, the American designer Narciso Rodriguez repositioned it as a ready-to-wear label, delivering simple, sellable clothes. Later, the British designer Stuart Vevers would shift the company's focus back to handbags. So, unlike Saint Laurent or Gucci -- where, some have speculated, Anderson might one day end up -- Loewe was a bit of a blank slate. There wasn't much of a heritage to adhere to, and Anderson started running it as if he were operating an experimental gallery, presenting customers with things they didn't know they wanted and couldn't quite understand. His debut women's collection for the brand, held in an Isamu Noguchi-designed sculpture garden outside of the UNESCO headquarters in Paris in June 2014, featured baggy leather pants in pale blue and bright yellow, macramé halter tops and latex T-shirts with a mallard motif. In the years since, he's become an uncanny illusionist, producing trompe l'oeil garments and incorporating surprising materials -- from makeup brushes to sink drain covers -- that can feel almost like sleights of hand or, as one critic put it, "decidedly normal things made abnormal." At his spring 2016 women's show, he sent models out in pants covered with shards of mirrored glass; his spring 2023 women's collection included dresses with bodices shaped like anthuriums. His interests, which are communicated through each garment, are varied. "He can discuss an inspiration trip to Naples -- and, like, napkins -- forever," says Lee. "You could be talking about [the pop star] Charli XCX and then he'll be like, 'Look at this amazing Venetian artifact I found,"' says the actress and writer Ayo Edebiri. "The problem with the world," Anderson says, "is that there are so many things to discover."
A decade in, Anderson has transformed the formerly sleepy Spanish label into one of fashion's noisiest and most innovative hype machines -- and, frankly, its most meme-able -- almost single-handedly reinvigorating red-carpet showmanship and shaping online fashion discourse more than maybe any other designer of his generation. Some of the clothes almost seem to project hostility toward the enterprise at hand -- models have struggled to walk in molded Plasticine shorts; one floor-length dress, pierced at the neck with a giant sewing pin, felt more like a dare than an outfit -- but there's a playfulness to them, too. Plaza, known for her deadpan humor, says she felt "spiritually connected" to the "soft, buttery gown with an aggressive spear cutting through it" that she wore this past January for the 2023 Emmys.
According to Anderson, Loewe is now a roughly $ 2 billion business. (He wants to grow the company to $ 3 billion. It's "really American of me," he says.) In his ability to make clothes that are both avant-garde and commercial, Anderson has something in common with Rei Kawakubo, the Japanese designer of Comme des Garçons. Pieter Mulier, the Belgian creative director of the brand Alaïa, says that the two designers also share a sense of modesty. "The public doesn't know much about Jonathan's private life," says Mulier, who lives near Anderson in Paris. "And I think that's much more respectable than, let's say, the older generation, where designers were nearly as big as the brands they worked for." Describing her first impression of Anderson, Lee says, "This sounds kind of insulting, but he was so normal," and compares his look (he's almost always in jeans and a T-shirt) to that of a "hot fraternity brother" from a Midwestern college. "He's not one of those reclusive artists who's in his own cave."
Levy, Anderson's friend, says, "In an industry where test audiences and algorithms dictate a lot of what we do creatively, he's somehow managed to work within the system but challenge it at the same time." The Scottish stylist Joe McKenna, an early supporter of Anderson's work, says, "The clothes weren't repeating an idea, but you believed [they were] from the same hand as the previous collections you'd seen. A bit like Miuccia Prada, he's constantly rummaging through his own language box to pull out new things." Also like Prada, a hero and former employer of his, he's more interested in exploring different materials and fabrication techniques than in creating another pretty dress. (Whether a garment is flattering is often beside the point -- awkwardness, if not the goal, is encouraged.) "For some people, their drug is the idea of continuity," he says. "That is not my drug. We have bags for that."
But not everyone can pull off a stiletto with a cracked-egg heel (spring 2022) or a coat and shoes sprouting living grass (spring 2023), and Anderson also designs things for clients who aren't quite so bold: The Loewe Puzzle, a handbag introduced in 2014 and made by jigsawing together geometric pieces of leather, has become the brand's answer to the Hermès Birkin or Fendi Baguette; in 2022, a padded Loewe bomber jacket, shaped a bit like a leather-wrapped Hershey's Kiss, sold out after Kendall Jenner posted a photo of herself wearing a green one. There are few designers who can exploit the internet so deftly: This past June, days after someone on social media described an heirloom tomato as being "so Loewe," Anderson revealed a red leather Loewe handbag that looked much like the fruit in question. In 2022, the night before her album "Crash" came out, Charli XCX was photographed carrying the JW Anderson Bumper, a rectangular shoulder bag outlined with tubular padding; two months later, she became the face of the accessory. "The reason he's able to attract all these different creative people," she says, is because he's one of them.
Designers have a long history of collaborating with artists, but what separates Anderson, who identifies as a snob, from some of his peers is that he's genuinely curious about objects and other art forms, and deeply knowledgeable about the references he deploys in his work. A compulsive collector of art, he's kept a portrait of a man sitting on a chair, by the mid-20th-century American photographer Peter Hujar, next to his bed in London; a large assortment of his other works -- many of them by gay artists, including 1940s photographs of male nudes by George Platt Lynes and a 1960s Paul Thek wax-and-steel sculpture that resembles hunks of meat -- will eventually reside at a house he's been building in North London.
In 2016, Anderson, who's also a trustee on the board of London's Victoria and Albert Museum, inaugurated the Loewe Foundation Craft Prize, an annual award recognizing excellence among potters, textile artists and other makers. (The latest recipient was the Mexican-born ceramist Andrés Anza.) Over the years, he's reinterpreted the work of other underappreciated or overlooked gay artists, including Joe Brainard, an informal member of the New York School in the 1960s, whose collages of pansies were printed on shirts and woven into cardigans for Loewe's fall 2021 men's collection; the homoerotic Finnish illustrator Tom of Finland, whose estate has partnered with JW Anderson on a few occasions; and the American artist and AIDS activist David Wojnarowicz, who died of complications from the disease in 1992 and whose work, including "Untitled (One Day This Kid ... )" (1990-91), was repurposed for a clutch and a custom suit with ballooning sleeves worn by Levy at the 2021 Met Gala, which was dedicated that year to American fashion.
A cynical reading of Anderson's work might accuse him of cultural vampirism: By positioning himself alongside history's great embattled artists, he makes his own output feel all the more subversive. But there's a delicateness to his approach; few designers, if any, care or know enough to challenge the artists they're working with to try something new. The 82-year-old American artist Lynda Benglis, famous for her wax paintings and poured latex sculptures -- and whose massive fountains dominated the set of the spring 2024 Loewe men's show -- ended up designing jewelry for the brand. The Los Angeles-based artist Richard Hawkins, 63, whose collages of young heartthrobs, often either bloodied or sexualized, adorned sweatpants, beaded leather bags and knitted tunics for Loewe's fall 2024 men's collection, was skeptical when he was asked to collaborate. His concern, he says, was that his work would be reduced to "coffee cups and mouse pads." Instead, Anderson added another dimension to Hawkins's pinup universe, inviting the artist to create video works for the show featuring actors such as Jamie Dornan and Manu Rios, who sat nearby in the front row. He and Anderson included at least one actor with an OnlyFans page, but Hawkins says he was told to avoid depictions of masturbation. "I think Jonathan pushes [LVMH] as far as they'll go when it comes to sexuality and queerness."
TWO WEEKS LATER, I arrive at the Loewe offices in Paris's Ninth Arrondissement. When we last met, in London before the fall 2024 JW Anderson show -- which ended up telegraphing an uneasy vision of English nostalgia, with models, some of them in curly gray wigs, wearing stodgy underwear and minidresses made from skeins of knitting wool -- Anderson was edgy but focused, maybe even a little cocky. Now, three days after his fall 2024 women's show for Loewe, he seems ready to murder someone.
"After a show, you don't want to be near me," he warns, smoking next to an open window on a cloudy afternoon in March. The Loewe collection, which offered a quirky take on aristocratic style with morning coats embroidered with tiny caviar beads and a crepe jersey shift dress with a blurry tartan motif, had been a success. (One of the three fashion critics whom he pays much attention to called the show "great" and "inspiring.") But he's standing next to his antique wooden desk -- uncluttered except for a white vase of Creamsicle-hued buttercups and a mug with a drawing on it of a five-man orgy -- trying not to explode. Before the pandemic, Anderson would fly to Miami or Argentina after his final show of the season; this year, he stayed in Paris with his boyfriend, the Catalan artist Pol Anglada, 33, with whom he frequently collaborates, succumbing to what he describes as nonverbal "death spirals." That some of his fellow designers had gotten similar praise for work that Anderson sees as inferior to his -- "You can't just fake a formula"; "It's the same product"; "It looked like Neiman Marcus" -- infuriates him, as if the approval is meaningless when it's not only his to receive.
As energized as he is by winning, Anderson feels like there's no one to outdo. "I'm looking out there and there's nothing," he says. When that happens, he creates his own challenges. With "Queer," for example, he decided that the cast would wear almost exclusively vintage clothing from the 1940s and '50s. ("Down to my boxer briefs," says the actor Drew Starkey, who plays Craig's love interest. "It was nerve-racking," says Craig. "If you spill coffee all over the suit, it's ruined.") One of the few times Anderson was jealous of someone else's work -- "It's so amazing when you see a show and you're like, 'Damn it,"' he says -- was in 2021, when Demna, the provocative creative director of Balenciaga, came out with his first couture collection. "I thought it was groundbreaking in terms of proportion and silhouette and nostalgia and non-nostalgia and angst," he says, "and what couture could mean."
Andrew Webster, an old friend of Anderson's and the brand image director at JW Anderson, says, "Jonathan is an overworker, to the point where, even if we're all fatigued and exhausted, he's like, 'I've got another idea."' Unlike many members of his generation, Anderson doesn't feel a compunction to find something nice to say about others' efforts in the office. More than once, he's interrupted a design meeting to tell the team that "everything's a disaster"; he's also been known to scrap social media posts and entire campaigns. The French stylist Benjamin Bruno, one of Anderson's most trusted creative partners, admits that they've had some "extremely fiery and dramatic" disagreements over the years. "If you don't argue," says Bruno, "it means you don't care."
Each year, Anderson releases a total of eight runway collections for Loewe and JW Anderson, traveling between Paris and London. While it's rare for a designer who runs a business the size of Loewe to still have their own label with a fully realized identity and fan base -- Anthony Vaccarello suspended his brand after being hired at Saint Laurent in 2016; the late Virgil Abloh kept Off-White going following his Louis Vuitton appointment, but he didn't design women's wear there -- Anderson treats JW Anderson as a kind of creative laboratory. If Loewe is eccentric and unpredictable, JW Anderson can feel downright volatile. The same year that a Loewe dress was structured into a car shape, BMX handlebars and broken skateboards were incorporated into JW Anderson tops and sweaters. "This is someone who has something quite bold to say," Matthieu Blazy, Bottega Veneta's creative director, recalls thinking after attending one of Anderson's shows. "If you really want to push the boundaries of clothing," says Anderson, "you have to be a bit obsessive."
IN A WAY, Anderson was raised to win. He was born in 1984 in Magherafelt, a small town in Northern Ireland, during the Troubles, the sectarian conflict that lasted from the late 1960s to 1998 between the largely Protestant unionists, who wanted the province to remain part of the United Kingdom, and the mostly Roman Catholic nationalists, who wanted to secede. His mother, Heather, taught high school English. His father, Willie, was a star rugby player. (To this day, Webster, who describes the Anderson clan as "salt-of-the-earth people," says, "It's a very slow journey if you're out with Willie because everyone wants to chat with him or buy him a drink.") Before heading off to school, Anderson would check underneath the car for bombs. "I was so lucky that I grew up in that because [it makes] you realize you can lose everything in a heartbeat," he says.
As a teenager, Anderson, who has an older brother, Thomas, now the operations director of JW Anderson, and a younger sister, Chloe, would trawl the racks of a local department store for dead-stock Jean Paul Gaultier. "In Ireland, the idea of standing out is a very unusual thing," says Anderson, who nonetheless belongs to a long line of eccentrics who grew up there; like Oscar Wilde and Francis Bacon, who were antagonized or jailed for being gay, he's learned how to wield his wit like a weapon. "Sometimes you can only reflect on how amazing a country is by getting out," he says. "[James] Joyce had to leave Ireland to write about it." At 18, Anderson relocated for a couple of years to Washington, D.C., to study performance at the Studio Acting Conservatory. Although his parents were supportive, he recalls their telling him, "Do what you want. Just don't spend money you don't have."
Back in Northern Ireland, Anderson was kind of a loner, but in Dupont Circle, the gay neighborhood where he was living in the basement of a George Stumpf-style townhouse, he felt like everyone was his best friend. Instead of focusing on honing his craft, Anderson says, "it was literally Girl Gone Wild." Within a week of being there, he'd started drinking and smoking. On one occasion, he went to a party in Baltimore for what he thought was one night; only afterward did he come to realize that three days had passed. "I'd gone from being this polite child to being a mental person," he says.
A couple of years later, Anderson, who'd run out of money, returned to Ireland. He moved into a rental apartment in Dublin with Willie, who had been commuting from home to coach the Leinster rugby team. ("My dad was only there two days a week," says Anderson with a smirk. And at that point, "I know exactly who I am.") He got a job as a sales associate in the men's wear department at a clothing store. It was an exciting time in men's fashion: Tom Ford was doubling down on louche glamour for Gucci; Hedi Slimane had been proposing a new superskinny silhouette at Dior Homme. After work, Anderson would borrow outfits to wear clubbing and hope that no one accidentally burned them with a cigarette; one assumes that even if they had, he'd have put the garments back on the rack the next morning.
Eventually, when the luster of late nights had mostly worn off, he put together what he calls "a weird mood board of stuff" and applied to various universities. The one school that accepted him was London College of Fashion. Between classes, he worked as a visual merchandiser under Manuela Pavesi, Miuccia Prada's close friend and trusted colleague, at Prada. Pavesi, who died in 2015, liked to wear pajamas with diamonds; knowing this, Anderson arrived for his interview in a vintage paisley dressing gown that he'd cut above the knee -- "almost sort of slutty," says Webster, who would become his manager at Prada -- with tight Dior jeans underneath and a pair of Prada boots. While they were working on a window display one day, Webster recalls, Anderson disappeared; he later found the designer on the street, wearing a long coat covered with accessories that he'd designed, getting his picture taken for i-D magazine. "Jonathan was always a bit of an opportunist, really," says Webster, later adding, "He has this ability to wrap you up into his orbit, and you're not quite sure how you got there sometimes, but you're in it."
Anderson presented his graduate collection -- which he describes as "woeful" and "the most ridiculous" -- at a London nightclub in 2005; the cabaret star Justin Vivian Bond, in an ermine stole and a headpiece made from netting and plastic flies, sang as the models came down the runway. (Anderson and Webster still play the recording of Bond and Kenny Mellman's 2004 show at Carnegie Hall, "Kiki and Herb Will Die for You," on a loop at the JW Anderson studio.) "Jonathan has the discernment to know that [the drag performer] Divine, although queer and much more contemporary than, say, [the 18th-century English painter Thomas] Gainsborough, is also, in their way, a masterpiece," says Bond. "Knowing what's extraordinary in many contexts -- he's really good at keying into that." In his JW Anderson designs, some of which took inspiration from the early 20th-century Russian mystic Grigori Rasputin and William Gedney's 1960s photographs of American teenagers, Anderson, who doesn't sketch, laid the groundwork for what would become his pastiche approach. Even now, he says that the part of the process he loves most is "trying to get this weird thing -- a color or a painting -- out of my brain." Seldom do the clothes come from something as straightforward as "shearling" or "sci-fi," says Bruno, who has a background in art criticism and literature. "It's a little more psychological than that."
Not coincidentally, Anderson's closest friends and collaborators -- among them Bruno, Guadagnino and the rapper and fashion designer ASAP Rocky, who shares, he says, an "innate search for the peculiar" -- are magpies and polymaths with strong but ever-changing visual identities. "He's the right kind of crazy," says Rocky, who created a JW Anderson capsule collection in 2016. "Anytime I'm hitting a brick wall, my guy is always like, 'Maybe you should do this, maybe you should do that.' And if he needs some advice, like, 'Maybe you should think twice about inviting these corny-ass celebs to your next show,' I'm there to voice that, too." Bruno observes, "Jonathan trusts people, but only if he thinks they excel at what they're doing." As a leader, Anderson believes in "turning up the temperature just enough without breaking people," he says. "You've got to be able to get people to go down your vision hole, and you've got to hold their hand to make sure they don't waver."
Things were much simpler all those years ago, when Anderson and Bruno would sit on the floor of Anderson's London studio late at night, constructing what Bruno refers to as "ghosts of garments" with as many swatches of fabric as they could afford. Anderson was an early practitioner of genderless dressing -- he has separate men's and women's lines, but the sense has always been that anyone should wear whatever they like -- although that, too, was partly a practical decision. "We were just sharing the same patterns because he couldn't afford to have the atelier make two," says Webster. "His enthusiasm was so contagious and so naïve that you could only say yes to him," Bruno says. "There was that kind of youthful hope that you have when you don't know too much about life." A decade into his time at Loewe, Anderson has learned some difficult lessons. "Nothing will ever be good enough," he says, sounding just like an uncompromising artist. "It's quite lonely working two jobs in two different countries every week for 10 years." Still, the idea of giving up fashion seems just as impossible. It's been the vehicle for all his creative explorations and collaborations. The product might be clothes; the point, though, is craft.
"FEEL IT, IT'S so hard," says Josh O'Connor. In a suite at the Carlyle hotel on New York's Upper East Side on the eve of the Met Gala this past May, the 34-year-old British actor is gesturing toward his custom Loewe white vest, which is covered with thousands of tiny caviar beads. But the 10 or so other people in the room, including Anderson, are distracted by his pants. Someone reports that Harry Lambert, O'Connor's stylist, thinks his boots, which are also intricately beaded, with a floral motif, are too big, causing the pants to buckle at the ankles.
Lambert's assistant enters the room holding a pair of plain black boots. "Is she kidding?" says Anderson -- flowers must remain on the footwear somehow to adhere to the gala's theme -- redirecting his attention to O'Connor, who looks down at his legs with an exaggerated display of shame. "Let's add more satin," says a member of Anderson's team, instructing another to widen the pant legs. But it's Sunday night, they're told; all the fabric stores are closed. "Then cut the top of the boot," says Anderson with a measured impatience. "Well, no," the employee says. It would create too big of a mess. "But we could try buttons?"
Except for the faint sound of a Dolly Parton song playing in the background, the room goes silent. It's almost like watching the final set of a tennis match; neither opponent is prepared to yield. After what feels like forever, Anderson is the first to relent. "Buttons on the back," he says with a shrug. "But make sure they're not too round." In the end, they agree to tighten the top of the boot with a string. Having averted a crisis, the crew starts packing up. It's time for dinner and then a meeting with Lee, who will be wearing what Anderson describes as a "new type of structure" at tomorrow's event -- a white Loewe gown with floral appliqués and a neckline that extends upward and outward like an aerodynamic shield.
Anderson's phone buzzes: His mother has been reminding him to send her some pictures from the party. The following week, he'll be needed back in Paris to award the winner of the 2024 Loewe Foundation Craft Prize. Then he'll unveil his latest collaboration with the running brand On and, shortly after that, he'll present his new men's wear collections for JW Anderson and Loewe. (The latter, titled A Radical Act of Restraint, is partly inspired by the work of Hujar and Thek.) In the coming months, he'll release new Loewe campaigns starring Craig and Starkey -- an unofficial kickoff to the "Queer" press tour, which could be even bigger than that for "Challengers." As he goes through his schedule, a look of foreboding washes across his face. "You're trying to be the son and the brother and the boyfriend, and you want to be a nice person," says Anderson, who's been doing breathing exercises when he gets stressed out. Then a big, boyish smile spreads across his face. "I've never had so much fun in my life."

Full text: In the summer of 2018, Justin Bieber made a habit of walking around New York City in what looked like hotel slippers. He'd worn them out before, but by then he went seemingly everywhere in a plush white pair: To grab a coffee, to a church service at Hillsong, even to the beach. The choice baffled fans. Why was a multimillionaire wearing something that many hotel guests get for free? And did he not care about dirt? He remained undeterred. Later he incorporated the accessory into his streetwear brand, Drew House, ultimately paving the way for what has become one of the biggest trends of the past year. If members of the fashion world were confused by outdoor slippers then, they have since embraced them as an answer to our post-pandemic longing for home comforts.
The Row's pre-fall 2024 collection included several versions: open- and closed-toe slip-ons made of black-and-white superfine silk terry, some of them worn with coats. Like Bieber, the brand's designers, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, favor styling that appears effortless and footwear that seems better suited to Uber rides than the sidewalk. For them, the shoes make sense. But they weren't alone in showing elevated riffs on the house slipper. Miuccia Prada sent branded leather versions that resembled Tony Soprano's down Miu Miu's fall 2024 runway, and Matthieu Blazy designed a pair of leather slipper socks for Bottega Veneta the season before. Bode currently offers slippers for outdoor wear, and Prada, Wales Bonner, JW Anderson and Stòffa all sell men's styles of their own. New interpretations appeared last month on the runways at Carven and Toteme.
"What I see happening is this arms race between luxury brands to see who can be the most insouciant and take casual luxury to its ultimate conclusion," says Laura Reilly, the author of the shopping newsletter Magasin. If wearing expensive house slippers outside is likely to raise eyebrows, the appeal for customers is just as clear: These shoes are minimalist and surprisingly elegant. Maybe, they hint, you really did just roll out of the Ritz. "Now that we've normalized flip-flops as luxury items," Reilly says, "the next frontier is an indoor shoe that's never supposed to be seen by outside eyes."
Neelam Ahooja, a longtime customer of the Row's who has purchased the brand's flip-flops in the past, recently bought a pair of its Frances slippers for $ 990 and isn't afraid to wear them around Toronto, where she lives. "I think they're amazing," she says, describing them as comfortable and timeless. Made in silk jacquard with a leather sole similar to those of the Row's other flats, they're intended for "indoor-outdoor wear," according to the company's website. "They could be like a Birkenstock," Ahooja says. "I treat them in the same way, except that they do work with more of an elevated look." Now that the weather is cooler, she styles them with socks.
"You can wear them for every occasion, from cleaning your house to the party you've been looking forward to going to all week," says the Belgian designer Marie Adam-Leenaerdt, whose namesake line sells two styles of leather slipper: one with a flat sole, another with a wedge heel, both with a small bow on top. Naturally the idea came to her when she was working from home. But she produced the shoes in leather -- far hardier than terry cloth or silk -- so that she could wear them anywhere. "The leather is very soft, like a second skin," she says. "I wear the high heels, and I can walk for miles in them."
In addition to being comfortable, slippers project confidence when worn outdoors, some fans find -- a sense of proudly defying convention. "I don't really care what anyone thinks," says Ahooja in response to people who might question her decision to buy and wear her pair. Not even her husband, who, when he saw them, laughed and said, "Please don't tell me those are by the Row."

Fleece Pullovers to Give an Accountant the Chills: [Style Desk]

Full text: Camping's favorite material gets a luxury overhaul.
This month Jonah Weiner made a purchase that was a cry for help. Or at least a new financial adviser.
He spent $ 910 on a fleece pullover.
"My wallet wept," Mr. Weiner said.
But, as Mr. Weiner, 43, the co-writer of the ur-cool guy fashion newsletter Blackbird Spyplane, pleaded, this was no prosaic Polartec. It was an all-wool, Austrian-made fleece from the 5-year-old French brand Rier. With its gleaming Riri zippers and monochromatic scheme, it is like Dieter Rams's vision of a Patagonia pullover.
"What really leaped out was the cut," Mr. Weiner said. He tossed out adjectives: balloony, droopy, malleable. What he meant was that this wool fleece, which he purchased in a tangy yellow, draped unlike any other fleece he had tried on. His credit card didn't stand a chance.
If Mr. Weiner is a mark for dropping the equivalent of more than six Patagonia Snap-T jackets on a single fleece, he is a mark among many.
At the Canadian retailer Ssense, Rier's pullover is out of stock in a number of sizes and colors. Highsnobiety, the hypey blog turned hypey retailer, is nearly out of the fleece in brown. At Outline, a women's boutique in Brooklyn, the jacket in a Tweety Bird yellow has flown off its shelves.
And Rier's is not the only upscale fleece crowding the market.
The buzzy New York designer Colleen Allen offers a fitted $ 1,200 poly-fleece in a Victorian-inflected hourglass silhouette. It's the fleece that stumbled into "The Gilded Age." Drake's in London sells a $ 530 bouclé fleece as nubby and vibrant as a stuffed Elmo. The princeliest fleece of all comes from the Milanese fashion house Miu Miu: a mouse-gray full-zip that frankly could be a $ 46 Columbia coat, save for the teensy Miu Miu logo on the left chest. For that it fetches $ 2,350.
If Miu Miu's logoed fleece demonstrates the power of brand -- particularly a resurgent brand led by Signora Miuccia Prada -- Rier's fleece spotlights something deeper about what shoppers crave today: clothes ordinary in look but opulent to touch.
"I don't think the piece itself is particularly groundbreaking," said Calvin Holmes, the men's wear buying manager at Ssense. "But the fabric feels great, the colors are amazing and the fit makes it look great on pretty much anyone." He would hope so: Mr. Holmes owns two Rier fleeces in navy and gray. (He said he used his company's generous discount to get a deal on the pricey jackets.)
The fancy fleece reflects, or at least combines, several trends of the past decade in one irresistible package. In its banal fleeciness, it channels normcore, a knowing adoption of suburban-mall clothes. Its to-the-neck Patagonia-like shape nods to gorpcore, an inclination toward functional outdoor gear worn off the trail. And most of all, it syncs with quiet luxury, the very "Succession"-era push toward princely items like cashmere ball caps and suede field jackets that are elitist, but incognito.
"There's a focus on fabric and construction and color versus obvious branding," Mr. Holmes said of the fleece. He offered a surprising comparison: Loro Piana's $ 980 Summer Walk loafers. They're a conventional silhouette, lack branding and have become an in-the-know signifier. Summer Walks for Lear-jetting billionaires, Rier fleeces for buyers who trudge to Paris fashion shows.
There is also a cohort that seems to have convinced themselves that they're punishing their wallets for the benefit of the planet. Mr. Weiner said he and others were "skeeved out by the notion of wearing petroleum." (Most economical fleeces on the market are produced from polyester.) Shoppers like him, Mr. Weiner said, are soothed by the idea of buying something that connects them "as close as possible to some sheep on a hillside."
If this is a rosy image of people who spend $ 910 on clothes, it's one that will please Andreas Steiner, the Italian-born founder and designer of Rier.
Though he spent about seven years working at Prada, refining a palate for luxury goods at their most distilled, the inspiration for the wool fleece flows from growing up in the shadow of the Dolomites, where locals draped themselves in natural wool garments.
"If you go hiking, climbing outdoors, of course you need something that dries faster or is not that thick and heavy," said Mr. Steiner, who displays a conservationist's brio absent in most high-fashion designers.
His wool fleeces, he said, won't leach microplastics into the water as polyester versions have been found to in studies. He went as far as to claim that the fleece could decompose entirely within about six weeks if it was buried. (The New York Times did not test this out.)
Mr. Steiner is aware that there's any number of ways he could get the cost down. He could add thrifty polyester to the material, produce them in Bulgaria where wages are lower than Austria or switch the zippers. But that would compromise his vision. The price, he said, is "honest."
Some shoppers seem to agree. Even if their wallets hate it.

While Not a Therapist, She Elicits Revelations: [Style Desk]

Full text: The designer Bella Freud -- a great-granddaughter of Sigmund Freud -- is using her podcast to "learn vicariously all the things I've secretly wanted to know" about celebrities.
"I haven't read much of anything," Bella Freud said when discussing the books written by her great-grandfather Sigmund Freud. "I've read the comic books."
Though she may be ignorant of the orthodoxies of her great-grandfather's tomes on psychoanalysis, that hasn't deterred Ms. Freud, a London-based designer, from occasionally riffing on the topic. It was not long after founding her fashion label in 1990 that Ms. Freud released a successful line of slogan sweaters bearing the logo "Psychoanalysis." Later, she would introduce a Psychoanalysis fragrance, an eau de parfum with combined notes of tobacco flower, cedar wood, amber and musk. Now she adds to her pseudo-Freudian canon that 21st-century inevitability, a podcast.
"Fashion Neurosis" is a series of 30-minute sessions that mimic classic therapeutic practice in both essence and detail. A clock ticks. A doorbell rings. A disembodied voice through an intercom says "come in." A subject is buzzed into Ms. Freud's "studio," and an interview takes place on a couch. Sitting near the analysand, an unseen Ms. Freud begins the session.
"I wanted to talk to people who didn't really talk a lot," Ms. Freud said last week by phone from London, referring to guests on the podcast like the designer Rick Owens, the actress Courteney Cox, the retired French soccer star Eric Cantona, the former Sonic Youth frontwoman Kim Gordon and the model Kate Moss. On the face of it, these people would seem to be so famous their lives no longer hold many secrets. That is before we learn some of their innermost thoughts.
"Ostensibly, I ask questions through the prism of clothes," said Ms. Freud, 63. "But clothes are just a way to start the conversation."
Clothes are little more than a jumping-off point for Mr. Owens to reminisce about his fleshy boyhood body and how it would eventually transform, over decades of daily work at the gym, into a chiseled physique that stands out in the world of fashion.
Gazing at the ceiling, or a ceiling-mounted camera, Mr. Owens, 62, seems to float in consciousness as he muses that the body dysmorphia he experienced in childhood might have contributed to a later-life propensity for designing clothes that often treat human anatomy as an afterthought. "Distortion and exaggeration is always what I'm going for," he said. "Distorting the human figure is so much more profound than doing an embroidery that takes 7,000 hours."
Mr. Cantona's storied soccer career -- most memorably with Manchester United -- was often marred by controversy, as in a 1995 away match against Crystal Palace. Angered by a referee who had sent him off the field, Mr. Cantona launched a wild kick into the crowd, striking a Crystal Palace fan. He was later tried and convicted of criminal assault, though his conviction was overturned on appeal. It was less the incident itself that came to define Mr. Cantona, who eventually did 120 hours of community service, than a single gnomic statement he made at a news conference after the game.
"When the seagulls follow the trawler, it's because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea," he said, walking off without another word.
"I've always loved that statement," Ms. Freud said. Although no soccer fan ("I don't know anything about football"), she admired what she called Mr. Cantona's "uncompromising, poetic, irreverent and philosophical" manner. This is on ample display in "Fashion Neurosis," where the soccer star, now middle-aged, ruminates in surprisingly earnest ways on his desire to exit the trap of celebrity existence to commune with nature.
"Initially," Ms. Freud said, "when I was playing with ideas for a podcast, I wanted it to be like a chat show, but very, very short. Then, when I thought more about all the people I'd like to talk to and how if someone is on a couch and I'm in a chair, we can be in any room, we came up with 'Fashion Neurosis.' I realized it was a way to learn vicariously all the things I've secretly wanted to know."
For fans of Ms. Moss, "Fashion Neurosis" was a means of revealing that bewitching experience, well known among those in the supermodel's inner circle, of "being Mossed," where she charms those in her orbit into staying out long past their bedtimes. The podcast was also a way to dispel simplistic "Devil Wears Prada" myths about the richly dimensioned fashion world and -- countertransference would probably be the right word here -- to unearth Ms. Freud's own deep-seated motives for doing what she does.
"If I had had a perfect body, I would never have become a designer," Ms. Freud recently wrote in an Instagram post. "My insecurities and self-doubt are what propelled me into the world of creating clothes, as a foil for my dissatisfaction and frustration with my appearance."

Full text: A growing number of brands have embraced a new handbag shape that evokes the skinny, elongated bodies of dachshunds.
Over the past year or so, a growing number of brands have embraced a new handbag shape. It's neither bowler nor baguette; not a satchel or a saddle.
Skinny and elongated, it has a figure similar to that of a hot dog bun -- or a wiener dog. You could call it a dachshund bag.
"I think it's the newest, freshest shape we have seen in the market in the last three to four years," said Will Cooper, the senior vice president for women's designer clothing, shoes and bags at Saks Fifth Avenue. "It feels like something people don't already have in their wardrobe."
Khaite, Jil Sander and Tory Burch are all labels that have made bags with the oblong shape, which some in the industry have named "east-west." Among the first brands to introduce it was Alaïa, which called its version the "teckel" -- or "dachshund" in French. (That and the other newer styles are not to be confused with a four-legged bag that Thom Browne released in 2016 and that was named for and made to resemble his wire-haired dachshund, Hector.)
Mr. Cooper said the recent crop of dachshund-shaped bags were "noticeable without being logo-focused," placing them somewhere between styles associated with the quiet-luxury trend and others with heavy branding. "These are still sophisticated and understated but not in a quiet way," he said.
Alaïa's creative director, Pieter Mulier, introduced the teckel bag at a runway show in July 2023. He landed on its shape while aiming to develop a bag that looked out of proportion, a representative for the brand said in an email. Mr. Mulier often brings his black Labrador retriever, John John (not named for John F. Kennedy Jr.), to Alaïa's studio.
Mr. Mulier works partly in Paris, the capital of a country where dachshund ownership has been on the rise. According to Centrale Canine, the French equivalent of the American Kennel Club, the number of dachshund puppies registered with the organization increased by 4 percent last year compared with in 2022, while the number of all purebred puppies registered decreased by 11 percent in 2023 compared with the year before.
The breed is popular in Paris, said Fleur-Marie Desfougères, a director at Centrale Canine, because its small stature makes it more suitable for city living. The designer Simon Porte Jacquemus, who lives and works in Paris, adopted a spotted dachshund in 2020 and gave the dog, Toutou, his own Instagram account.
The designer Sandy Liang, who included a bow-embellished, oblong-shaped bag in her fall 2024 collection, said its form reminded her of a pencil case. "If I was a little kid drawing a purse, this is what it would look like," Ms. Liang said.
With some of the mini bags that became popular in recent years, people found it challenging to fit certain essentials: "My phone, my readers, my wallet," as Kyle Branch, the fashion director at the Dallas boutique Forty Five Ten, put it.
The bags shaped like dachshunds, he said, "hold all of that while being compact."
During recent fashion weeks, bags with the silhouette were spotted in the spring 2025 collections of labels like Bottega Veneta, Prada and Conner Ives. The shape has yet to be fully embraced by mass-market brands, but Mr. Branch believes that is possible.
"They have gained a lot of momentum over the past two seasons, and based on history, everything that performs this way has a good shelf life," he said of the bags. "I don't think they are disappearing. They are special and easy."

Paris Hilton Is Bringing Back Y2K: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A new line of handbags expands the offerings of her brand at the big-box chain. Plus, rare Birkenstocks and a pink suit you may have seen.
Paris Hilton is associated with many things -- being an heiress, an entrepreneur, an activist and a Y2K fashion inspiration -- but living on a budget is not often among them.
Affordability, however, is at the heart of Paris Hilton for Walmart, the namesake lifestyle brand she has developed in partnership with that big-box chain, where she recently introduced a line of handbags mostly priced under $ 30.
"It's definitely a full-circle moment from 'What's Walmart?' in 'The Simple Life' to having Walmart have walls of Paris Hilton product everywhere," Ms. Hilton said, referring to the 2000s reality TV series in which she and Nicole Richie, another scion of wealth, traded their cosmopolitan lifestyles for tastes of rural America.
Since her partnership with Walmart, one of the country's biggest retail chains, began last year, Ms. Hilton has put her name on ice cream makers, Santoku knife sets and baby clothing sold at the store. Makeup and bedding are in the works, too, she said.
The 13 handbag styles she has designed for Walmart include a quilted iridescent pink tote ( $ 32); a heart-shaped denim cross-body bag that says "Paris" in sparkly lettering ( $ 24); and a bowling bag featuring a print of smiling Pomeranian dogs ( $ 25).
She sees them as alternatives to the designer bags from brands like Prada and Chanel that she often carries, prices for which "have gotten really high," she said, as the global luxury market has continued to grow.
Bags are a category in which Ms. Hilton, 43, feels she has a particular expertise. At the peak of her early 2000s fame, certain styles she wore to Los Angeles nightclubs and Hollywood events -- the Fendi Spy, the Dior Saddle, the Chloé Paddington -- became widely coveted.
"It was before influencers," Ms. Hilton said. "I had no stylist and was putting the looks together on my own." Prices rarely factored into her choice of accessories, she added. "Every designer was sending me bags, so I wasn't paying attention."
Early 2000s fashion has lately had an outsize influence on young shoppers and stores that cater to them. In the past few years, dresses and mini skirts that look like carbon copies of clothing Ms. Hilton wore 20 years ago have proliferated.
Her recollection of the role she played in setting that era's trends was befitting of a person who has been putting herself in the spotlight since her teenage years.
"When I look back at Y2K fashion, the one person I think had the biggest impact on handbags was me," Ms. Hilton said.
Shop Talk: Rare Birkenstocks and a Pastry-Themed Pop-up
Modern Americana
Next week Todd Snyder, the designer who helped modernize J. Crew's men's wear before starting his own namesake brand, is releasing his first collection for Woolrich, which appointed Mr. Snyder as its creative director in November.
His 65-piece Woolrich Black Label line, a new offshoot of the almost 200-year-old American brand, includes slick riffs on its classic outerwear and work wear. The line has two categories: heritage, which includes felted cashmere shirts and buffalo-check parkas, and technical, featuring items like parachute pants and hiking boots.
"I wanted to do a repeat of classics and inject modernity and technical materials with a luxury appeal to have some street cool factor," Mr. Snyder said on a call on Thursday, as he was cooking a brisket for the Rosh Hashana holiday.
The collection will be available online and at Todd Snyder stores starting Oct. 10. Prices range from $ 128 to $ 1,498.
Special Sandals
Birkenstock, to commemorate its 250th anniversary this year, has released 250 pairs of a limited-edition style of its Kyoto sandal. The Kyoto Tradition sandal ( $ 530) is made of deerskin sourced from what the brand said is the lone tannery in Germany that still softens hides with only salt, water and fish oil, a technique known in German as altsämisch, which was traditionally used to make lederhosen.
The sandals are embossed with an antler-shaped motif as an ode to what Birkenstock in marketing copy calls "Bavarian craftsmanship."
A Pastry-Themed Pop-up Shop
Lydia Rodrigues Collection, a store in Manhattan's East Village, is known for its eccentric selection of apparel and accessories -- and for its seasonal pop-up shops curated around abstract themes. The concept for the latest pop-up, open through the end of October: croissants. (Past themes have included "potential" and "poetry.")
Lydia Rodrigues, who started the business in 2015, has filled the store with products that to her embody certain qualities of croissants, like their buttery softness, layered construction and golden color. Items include clothing, jewelry and home goods from emerging brands like Extreme Cashmere, SC103, Aesa and Bless.
Three Questions for the Creator of a Certain Pink Suit
Viewers of the vice-presidential debate on Tuesday may have noticed that Barbie-pink suits were worn by multiple female TV anchors and hosts that evening. Margaret Brennan of CBS News, a moderator of the debate, wore a pink blazer. The CNN host Kaitlan Collins wore monochrome pink look. Taylor Tomlinson, the host of "After Midnight" on CBS, also wore the color.
Some of their clothes came from the same label: Argent. Ms. Collins and Ms. Tomlinson were among the women to wear its fluorescent pink suits on Tuesday, as the brand kicked off the third iteration of a campaign it has promoted during election cycles in 2022 and 2020 to encourage voting and to advocate gender equality.
On social media, celebrities like Jessica Alba, Alicia Keys, the former pro-tennis player Andy Roddick and Bill Nye (the science guy) shared photos of themselves in pink Argent clothes -- Mr. Roddick and Mr. Nye wore gender-neutral suits the brand introduced this year to complement the versions it sells in women's sizing.
In a brief interview that has been edited and condensed, Sali Christeson, who founded Argent in 2016, shared her thoughts about the symbolism of a pink suit and the color itself.
What did you make of Margaret Brennan wearing a pink suit jacket that was not from Argent on the day your campaign kicked off?
For her to make that choice shows a level of confidence and communicates something bigger. The choice of a suit is powerful and functional, and it's something that's long been tied to men. Wearing one in a color that's been used as a pejorative at times, and reclaiming that, really communicates all the right messages from our perspective.
Female politicians on both sides of the aisle, including Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, and Nikki Haley, a Republican, have worn pink. What do you think this signals?
Gov. Whitmer wore our pink suit on election night in 2022, and she has been very vocal about leaning into pink as part of advice handed down from her mother. Nikki Haley used clothing in a similar way to convey a set of values. I think that's what really good politicians do -- they use dress choices to work in their favor. Without doing any talking they let outfits speak for themselves.
Is pink a nonpartisan color?
I do think pink is nonpartisan. Women just feel emboldened right now and are eager to showcase that through their dress.

Full text: The costume designer of "Sex and the City" and "The Devil Wears Prada," now 82, still heeds her family's advice.
The Unstoppables is a series about people whose ambition is undimmed by time. Below, Patricia Field explains, in her own words, what continues to motivate her.
Age means nothing to me. In my mind, I'm probably 40. I've always gotten my energy by associating with people who are younger. I still do. It's a habit I formed early in life. Young energy is optimistic.
That pattern continues in my store/art gallery on East Broadway in Manhattan and in my projects. I did a book last year. I don't like to call it a memoir because "memoir" suggests some kind of an ending, and I wasn't feeling an ending. The book was more a trip through a series of experiences. I had the opportunity to speak my words, so I did.
I had a great time on "Happy Clothes," the documentary I worked on with the director Michael Selditch. Part of the fun was being filmed tooling around Brooklyn in my T-Bird with the top down.
The documentary opens with me swimming in a pool. I've been swimming since I was a kid. I feel spontaneous in the water. That scene has memories that are meaningful to me. Swimming reminds me of my mother, who was a swimmer as well. We had a little bungalow in Connecticut off a lake called Bantam Lake, and we would swim there most days.
My mother had a dry cleaning business in Queens -- I think of her as an entrepreneur -- and she was a major influence in the way I am. She wasn't the kind to give advice. She did what she did. But the ambition I got, it started with her.
The women in my family, my aunts, my grandmother -- they were achievers. They inspired me. They taught me: Do what you like and what you're good at, and you'll make things happen. I've always liked fashion, so working in fashion was easy for me.
But to do what I love, I need to be inspired. Nothing clicks if I'm not inspired. Darren Star, whom I worked with on "Sex and the City," challenged me. He wasn't always happy with my styling choices, but I could usually sell him.
Betty Halbreich inspired me. I was shocked when I worked on projects with her at Bergdorf Goodman and she told me that she had daughters in their 70s. That meant she was in her 90s at the time. Age didn't mean anything to her.
The people who inspire me now are artists I've associated with: Jody Morlock, Scooter LaForge. These are people I've known for years. Their work is in my gallery. For me, they represent a kind of continuity. They impressed me, and what impresses me stays with me.
When people start carrying on about me, calling me a legend, an icon, it's a distraction. It makes me feel an obligation, that the name is something I have to live up to. Me, I'm not a diva. I've never liked being in the spotlight. I'm not here to be famous.
I've had long-term relationships, one with a stylist, another with a woman who was a go-go dancer when I met her. Right now there is no one special in my life. I feel a little lonely sometimes, I'm not going to deny it. But I think I'm better off having nobody to answer to.
Late this month we're moving to a new gallery space on East Broadway, one that gives us more visibility. I'm happy to have a storefront on the street again. I wouldn't say we're moving forward so much as moving on. Only when you've lost interest is it time to stop. If you close yourself off, it's over.
Me, I'm still here with my team figuring out the next day.
Recent and upcoming projects: Subject of "Happy Clothes: A Film About Patricia Field," a documentary scheduled for theatrical release on Sept. 20; "Pat in the City: My Life in Fashion, Style, and Breaking All the Rules," a memoir published in 2023; Patricia Field ARTFashion Gallery, a combined store and gallery, set to reopen this month at a new location at 211 East Broadway.
This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

Full text: The style on and off the runways at Milan Fashion Week has a self-assurance that can be particularly noticeable to those arriving straight from London Fashion Week, which turned 40 this year but has maintained a fledgling spirit.
It's hardly a surprise to see great tailoring in Italy, and this season some of the best suits spotted on the streets of Milan had cuts that created sharp shapes as their wearers moved. There were other clothes with broad shoulders and poppy colors that evoked the fashion of the early MTV era. That boldness carried over to many accessories, particularly for the ears: There were loops, hoops, cuffs and climbers. Some earrings looked a little like weapons from a ninja's arsenal; others resembled bunches of grapes.
On the runway many labels played with fringe, which trimmed skirts at Prada and protruded from sleeve cuffs at Jil Sander. Bottega Veneta showed elegant looks that mixed materials, and Marni -- through prints, colors and silhouettes -- imbued its clothes with the type of eclecticism that makes fashion fun.

A Surprise Season of Stranger Things

MILAN — And thus began the season of the weird. After decades in which clothes that telegraphed sex or stealth wealth dominated the Milanese runways, it’s the stranger things that seem the most on target now.
“There’s a feeling that anything could happen, no matter how fantastical,” Matthieu Blazy wrote in his Bottega Veneta show notes, before seating his audience on low-slung leather bean bags in animal shapes — Jacob Elordi plopped down onto a bunny, Michelle Yeoh onto a ladybug. It turned a cavernous warehouse into a fun house and forced every guest to adopt an alternate perspective.
“Well, it’s kind of an irrational time,” Simone Bellotti said in something of an understatement backstage after his brilliant Bally show, inspired by German Dadaist Hugo Ball.
Indeed, the most eye-catching appearance of the week was not, as it turned out, Elordi, or Jin of BTS taking a post-military service front row seat at Gucci, but Cheryl Hines, the actress-wife of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. She showed up at Bally just after the news broke about her husband’s sexting relationship with a political reporter. (Apparently Hines is friends with the brand’s new owner, Michael Reinstein of global private equity firm Regent.) And the best casting was not Cavalli’s supermodel reunion but Sunnei’s embrace of 70- and 80-something models in its 10th anniversary meditation on time. As opposed to that old fashion shibboleth, timelessness.
You can either retreat into the safety of the elegant chocolate suit (for that, go to MaxMara), the always-appropriate leather trench (at Tod’s, Matteo Tamburini did it best) or you can take the confounding, bizarro nature of this global moment and turn it into a look. The best shows in Milan did.
A Breakthrough and a Blast
Bellotti, for example, did it in his third Bally show, the rare Milan collection to really explore the allure of a new silhouette, one that both evoked the looming fear of the unknown and offered a carapace to match.
Inspired by a sloping iron cape he found in a photo of Ball in his Dada heyday, Bellotti raised necklines and sloped shoulders. Rounded blouson jackets mimicked mountainous boulders and skirts were shaped à la cowbell, so they curved out at the hips and in at the thigh. Some peplums were so aggressively structured, they jutted out like horns from floral frocks or from under neat jackets. Or like the metal spikes on the Mary Jane shoes beneath, which referenced both Alpine climbers and punks and were based on a shoe Bally first made in 1945, in the shadow of World War II. Coincidence? Nah. More like a uniquely trenchant remix.
Just as Blazy’s through-the-looking-glass games at Bottega Veneta, in a show that evoked childhood’s reality distortion field, offered an unexpectedly uplifting outlet. Imagine pleated or pinstripe pantaskirts. (Wait — pantaskirts? What even is that? I’ll tell you: wrap or asymmetric skirts with one pant leg emerging from beneath.) As if someone got stuck in the midst of trying on two different pieces and decided to just go with both. The style offers one way to put your foot in it, anyway.
With them came jackets so oversize they looked as if they had been filched from a parent’s closet, and more skirts with swishing tassels at the knee. Shimmering metallic evening slip dresses under porcupine quill headdresses that resembled both sea anemones and squishy toys, like an incredibly glamorous dunce’s cap or the most cathartic party hat (or a supersize DIY Rod Stewart wig).
It’s the extremes that now stand out: clothes that dare go there, wherever there happens to be. Maybe the living rooms captured by Greg Girard’s photographs and superimposed on sheaths and patent leather at Jil Sander, where Luke and Lucie Meier took power tailoring to an entirely different place, literally. Or the parachute suede coats and silks at Ferragamo, where Maximilian Davis transformed the whole idea of leaping into the void. The trapeze shirting and soignée culottes at Sunnei, where Loris Messina and Simone Rizzo dared to imagine a future that wasn’t sci-fi, but rather sophisticated utilitarianism.
And the shredded denim at Diesel, where designer Glenn Martens continues to work his brand of fashion alchemy, transforming the most basic of fabrics into a vehicle of apocalyptic elegance with mind-blowing technique.
This time he did it by tufting dark denim into feathers at the collar of a jacket, lasering the faded blue of a cloudy sky into fringe and fantastical textures, and then filling the entire floor of his show space with an ocean of denim scraps, sculpted into undulating waves of detritus.
Recycling has never looked so unequivocally good.
The Scent of the Past
Certainly it was more interesting than the recycling of ideas going on at the biggest brands — Gucci, Moschino, Versace — all of whom seem to be in self-referential mode, turning inward and backward rather than outward.
That’s how it looked at Moschino, anyway, where Adrian Appiolaza in his second collection continued his tour of Moschino-isms past (pearls, slogans, bedsheets, bleach-bottle bags) with the aid of two collaborators — Terry Jones, formerly of i-D magazine, and the estate of jewelry designer Judy Blame — but without the crucial undercurrent of social commentary that made the brand’s original double-entendres-in-a-garment so resonant.
And how it seemed at Gucci, where Sabato De Sarno took as his muse Jackie Onassis. In her headscarves-and-big-glasses Capri years. Maybe every designer has to channel her at least once.
Cue similar headscarves and big glasses, plus car coats and minidresses woven from a neat floral-embossed raffia material for a bit of structure, as well as lots of bamboo accessories — bag handles, jewelry — that popped up in De Sarno’s nod to the Tom Ford Gucci era, in the form of gold hardware on slinky jersey dresses.
A more original way forward was offered by the ultra-miniskirts with tiny crinolines built into the elastic waistband so they popped out just a bit over the hip, worn with ribbed undershirts and matching big bucket hats, and the evening trench coats so long they dragged on the floor like trains.
There’s comfort in the known, sure, but stasis also. It’s hard to take risks when you have so much (revenue) to lose, but at the same time, not taking risks is pretty much a guaranteed shrug.
The tension was summed up perfectly, if probably unintentionally, at the Versace show, where Donatella Versace was inspired by one of her own Versus collections from 1997, back when she was running that line. A time, she recalled in a preview, that was full of “optimism” and “joy.” (You might think of it differently, but such is memory.)
So she brought it back, reviving the floral prints and squiggly graphics of that post-grunge collection in shades of tan, butter yellow and baby blue, and then mixing and matching it all in cropped tops, low-slung skirts and frayed jeans cut to show the tops of sheer pantyhose. The same prints and colors popped up on chain mail, some of which had been 3D printed. Because even nostalgia needs a semi-update.
The clothes, remakes of a fashion remake of an actual cultural phenomenon, were all balanced atop shoes that were themselves balanced on heels made to mimic perfume bottles. Was there ever a better metaphor for the state of fashion itself? Time to step into the surreal.

King Cole Bar Reopens, Still Merry but Moodier: [Style Desk]

Full text: After a major renovation, a cozy gathering spot at the St. Regis New York is ready to serve.
It's been a long eight months for Bill Dante.
Since January, when the King Cole Bar at the St. Regis New York, where he is a bartender, had its last night of service before a renovation, Mr. Dante has been keeping a close eye on his finances.
There have been none of the usual trips to Provincetown or Fire Island. Get-togethers with friends were limited to drinks and appetizers.
"It was really boring, and the heat wave was torture," he said. "My electric bill is huge."
If Mr. Dante was temporarily out of a job, his regulars have been out of sorts. On the night before the King Cole Bar went on hiatus, they seemed particularly anguished.
"They were just, 'Oh, what are we going to do? My God, where are we going to go?"' he said. He remembers having to fight an eye-roll: "This is New York City! I mean, you can go to the Peninsula, you can go to the Ritz-Carlton -- there's lots of lovely old establishments you can go to. But they love this room."
Ahead of the St. Regis New York's 120th anniversary, the hotel undertook the first major renovation of its public spaces in over a decade. On Thursday, the King Cole Bar, as well as the adjoining Astor Court and Petit Salon areas, will reopen to the public.
Ever since Col. John Jacob Astor IV opened its doors in September 1904, the hotel has loomed large in New York's idea of itself as the center of the universe -- creative, cultural and otherwise.
The playwright Noël Coward, the couturière Elsa Schiaparelli and the inventor Nikola Tesla have all called it home. It's where Mick Jagger held a rooftop rager, Jason Wu held a runway show and Salvador Dalí held court.
Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio had the biggest fight of their nine-month marriage in Suite 1105. Another famous couple, John Lennon and Yoko Ono, had a happier time while camped out in adjacent suites on the seventh floor soon after their arrival in New York.
For the St. Regis, which is owned by the Qatar Investment Authority and operated by the Marriott hotel chain, the renovation represented a costly high-wire act: How to update a space that means so much to so many? Champalimaud Design, a New York-based firm with experience renovating luxury hotels, led the effort.
"When we're working on these historic properties, they're bigger than all of us," said Ed Bakos, Champalimaud's chief executive. The goal, he added, is to suss out and play up what makes a property special.
In the case of the St. Regis, that meant the King Cole Bar, named after the 30-foot-wide mural by Maxfield Parrish. Made up of three panels, the oil painting was commissioned on Colonel Astor's behalf for another New York property, the Knickerbocker Hotel, and completed in 1906. In the 1930s, after the Knickerbocker was converted into an office building, it found its permanent home at the St. Regis.
The bar is a favorite of location scouts, having been selected as a suitable place for heroines at moments of crisis on the TV series "Gossip Girl" and in the films "The Devil Wears Prada" and "The First Wives Club."
But for all its IMDb credits, the bar has only ever played the part of a moody, windowless watering hole. In the redesign, Champalimaud decided to lean into the darkness.
There's no hiding from the fact that it's a small bar, Mr. Bakos explained. "You should feel like you're in a nest," he said. Low-level table lighting creates a sense of closeness, drawing you in toward your drinking companion, whether that's your date or a colleague.
Champalimaud enhanced that sense of intimacy by darkening the wood paneling and repainting the white ceiling a billiard-table green. Animal-print carpeting was jettisoned in favor of a midnight blue pattern of what appear to be streaking comets.
The open area just outside the bar -- formerly Astor Court, now called the Drawing Room -- is brighter, creating a contrast "between the light and reflective and the dark and the moody," Mr. Bakos said. But it doesn't have a monopoly on feminine energy: Within the expanded glass entry to the King Cole, plush velvet chairs in mauve, custom made by Meubles Saint-Damase in Canada, are trimmed with fringe that only just skims the floor, swishing like the hem of a skirt every time a seat is pulled out.
A Sense of History
The St. Regis has a healthy regard for its own history. This is, after all, a hotel that displays one of its original brass doorknobs in an acrylic cube in its ground-level Petit Salon. So when it came time for Champalimaud to step in, the hotel was more than happy to oblige with vintage photos and tales of Dalí's pet ocelot, known to sometimes accompany the artist during his stays.
The design team went back to the very beginning, taking cues from the Astor family and its vision for a modern hotel that could go toe to toe with the comforts of a personal residence.
"Part of our sort of story of this hotel was really focused on Caroline Astor and who she was as a person -- what she wore, what she liked," said Courtney Brannan, a principal at Champalimaud Design.
Colors that Caroline Astor, Colonel Astor's mother, was known to wear can be found throughout the public areas: teals and emeralds, reds and deep purples. Waist-height displays of American Beauty roses, Mrs. Astor's favorite, decorate the lobby -- a nod, Ms. Brannan said, to the way she welcomed hotel guests.
The ultimate gatekeeper of Gilded Age society, Mrs. Astor maintained a list known today as the Four Hundred: the highborn, well-bred personages who mattered in New York, at least in her view. It was from this list, according to Jenni Benzaquen, a senior vice president of St. Regis Hotels and Resorts, that Mrs. Astor selected the guests for her so-called "midnight suppers" at the hotel.
"They were fun and debaucherous and, you know, just very social," Ms. Benzaquen said. The tradition has inspired a series of similar banquets at St. Regis hotels around the world (though the gatherings no longer start at midnight).
A few "very careful interventions" -- Mr. Bakos's design-speak for knocking down a wall or two -- created new vistas that bridge the de-glossed and de-gilded lobby with a spruced-up concierge area. The change has also increased the seating options in the lobby area.
Elyse Moore, a longtime Manhattan resident who has lived within a block or two of the St. Regis for over 40 years, said she had been going to the King Cole Bar since she was in her 20s. (Don't bother trying to nail down her age: "I'm not going to tell," she said. "Bill has an idea," she added, referring to Mr. Dante, the bartender. "Ask him.")
She used to drink there with a girlfriend who owned a Rolls-Royce. After she died, Ms. Moore started going with a long-term boyfriend -- though when she went with him, they sat at a table.
"I didn't sit at the bar because I was in a relationship," she explained. "A lot of single people sit at the bar."
As much affection as she has for Mr. Dante and the other bartenders, it's not their deftness in pouring Prosecco -- her drink of choice these days -- that keeps her coming back: It's the crowd.
"Very elegant people go," Ms. Moore said.
"You could go schlumpy to another bar," she added, "but not the King Cole."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "Happy Clothes" covers her work on "Emily in Paris" and "Sex and the City," as well as her time as a tastemaker in the 1970s and '80s underground.
Patricia Field likes, as she puts it, "happy clothes." If you've seen her work, you get it; if you've watched TV, you have probably seen her work. The fashion maven is one of the most celebrated and influential costume designers of the past three decades, with "Emily in Paris," "The Devil Wears Prada" and "Sex and the City" among her credits. Michael Selditch's new documentary, "Happy Clothes: A Film About Patricia Field" (in theaters and on demand), follows Field as she works on the second season of the Starz comedy "Run the World," but the feature is really a celebration of her long career.
A movie like this can head in a lot of directions, and a possible weakness of "Happy Clothes" is that it tries to go in all of them. There are conversations with Field's friends and collaborators, including the "Devil Wears Prada" director David Frankel, the "Sex and the City and "Emily in Paris" creator Darren Star, and the actresses Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall and Lily Collins. Field's work in the past as the owner of a well-known boutique that bears her name comes to life through archival footage and interviews, while observational images show her working with assistants, shopping for pieces and going to sets.
There's just a lot here. But with a subject like Field, the mild chaos feels pleasantly appropriate. Her taste runs toward the conspicuous and bold, and several interviewees -- particularly Parker, who became a fashion icon partly because of her willingness to wear anything Field selected -- note that her choices can be shocking at first. Prints and patterns, gems and silhouettes, neons and bold accessories: You never really know what you'll get when you work with Field.
But that's why people love her. Her style, as she says, is happy. "I like clothes that don't die," she explains, a statement that reveals she's always thinking about longevity. Field is amazingly energetic -- her 80th birthday approaches as the film begins -- and she's interested only in the future, telling someone at one point that she doesn't keep an archive because she's always looking forward.
It's probably ironic, then, that the most illuminating element of "Happy Clothes" is a sequence in which her taste now is linked to her history as a central figure in New York's underground culture of the 1970s and 1980s. Former employees and customers attest to what it meant to have a place -- her store -- where they could be unapologetically queer or trans or just interested in fashion, where they didn't have to hide their identities. Field was ahead of her time in more ways than one, and this history suggests that she has been practicing an exuberant joy her whole career. That, "Happy Clothes" says, is her real legacy.

Who Says Your Couch Can't Match Your Bag?: [Style Desk]

Full text: Bold colors and bright patterns mark the first collaboration between the fashion house Clare V. and the home goods company Schoolhouse.
Clare Vivier, founder of Clare V., the Los Angeles handbag and apparel company with a playful Francophile twist, is no stranger to collaborations.
Among her first was with Mike D of the Beastie Boys, a mutual friend with whom she made her first men's capsule collection, in 2016, inspired by his need for a simple card wallet (to replace his makeshift rubber band). Ms. Vivier has since expanded beyond leather and soft goods to create eyewear with Caddis and Garrett Leight; bicycles with Linus; limited-edition drops with Mother Denim, Tracksmith, Westerlind and Racquet Magazine; and graphic prints with Framebridge, to name just a few. Clare V.'s team approximates the brand has produced nearly 100 collaborations to date. Most recently, the brand created apparel for the Carlyle hotel and a set of tees in support of Kamala Harris's presidential campaign, both of which promptly sold out.
"I've always loved doing collabs," Ms. Vivier said. "It's also a way for us to test new categories."
Now Ms. Vivier, 53, is releasing her first furniture and lighting design collection with the home goods company Schoolhouse, featuring a familiar set of patterns, textures and colors drawn from her signature palette.
There are 20 pieces in all, making the collection the largest collaborative release for Schoolhouse to date. It's also something of a departure from the American heritage look Schoolhouse has embodied since its 2003 start as a purveyor of deadstock lighting and, in following years, a broad range of home goods largely manufactured on site in Portland, Ore. Clare V.'s collection is also the brand's first with a fashion designer.
Items in the collaboration include a cotton-twill upholstered sofa in bold, oversized camel and black stripes, and another in emerald, cream or navy velvet. Cylindrical floor and table lamps feature a perforated sheet metal exterior, and shaded steel sconces are coated in a palette of persimmon, ecru and deep forest green acrylics. There are also patterned rugs and pillows featuring checkerboard and the enlarged two-tone jaguar spots that Ms. Vivier has revisited season after season.
The commingling between fashion and interior design is nothing new, but the industries have increasingly become close bedfellows. For its spring 2023 show, Bottega Veneta commissioned its candy-colored cast-resin runway set from the legendary furniture designer Gaetano Pesce. Louis Vuitton, Hermès, Loewe and Prada carry established presences with splashy presentations and events at Milan Design Week, a leading event in the interior industry. Rick Owens and Virgil Abloh have produced furniture collections, and the luxury mega-retailer Ssense carries a mix of furniture, glassware, home décor and more under the catchall category of "everything else."
"Everything we sell has a function, and you can't find anything in our assortment that's just purely decorative," said Melissa Miller, general manager of Schoolhouse and a self-avowed fan who owns eight Clare V. handbags.
Ms. Vivier's team had reached out to Schoolhouse to start a conversation, Ms. Miller said, and was met with enthusiasm, even as the designer pushed the brand beyond its usual comfort zone for cozy, vintage-inflected Americana in muted, neutral tones. "I don't know if I would have felt the permission to offer an animal-print rug," she said. "It came together in a way I didn't expect."
Ms. Vivier, who began her company as a new mother and a blogger in 2008, has long cultivated a dedicated fan base with an accessible online presence, which has since evolved into a robust following on Instagram, TikTok and a Substack newsletter, La Vie de Clare V.
But Ms. Vivier, ultimately in the business of creating items worn on the body, stresses her love of print and all things tactile. "There's always this 'high-touch' aspect to Clare V.," Ms. Vivier said.
Her team often creates custom fonts redrawn from snapshots of old signs from her frequent trips to France, where her husband is from, and evokes the typography of French New Wave cinema of the 1960s and '70s. She is a flea market hound, a lover of '70s décor and a collector of deadstock textiles and trimmings, some of which make their way into her designs and at her brick-and-mortar stores, such as her location in Amagansett, N.Y. -- one of the brand's 14 shops -- where she upholstered a plywood daybed herself.
Preparing for the Clare V. sample sale in downtown Los Angeles, an annual event, since 2014, that her dedicated following considers an event on the level of the Super Bowl, drawing thousands from all over, and a sweepstakes contest for airfare and a two-night stay to attend -- Ms. Vivier has transformed her West Hollywood store into a living room furnished with her Schoolhouse designs.
"I love home décor," Ms. Vivier said. Fashion is "my language, my self-expression, but I love that interiors can be an extension of that and how you want to live."

An Exuberant Label on the Brink of Adulthood: [Style Desk]

Author: Rysman, Laura

Abstract: None available.

Full text: One of the great mysteries of Milan, the city of Prada, Gucci, Armani and so many fashion Goliaths, is the scarcity of young brands. Sunnei, a self-declared outsider, is a star exception that has shown the Goliaths how to have fun in fashion with inventiveness and irony.
Surrounded by the midday senior crowd on the sunny patio of a tennis club in Milan, the label's founders, Simone Rizzo, 36, and Loris Messina, 35, stood out with their fresh faces, in sneakers and the same oversize Sunnei T-shirts (one in white, the other in screaming acid green).
They hate to be called young or to hear Sunnei, marking its 10th anniversary this year, called a young brand. Yet in the fashion landscape of the city, they are still, comparatively, the kids in the room -- albeit kids with a sharper grasp of what's going on than many of the adults.
For years Sunnei was deemed an upstart, putting on concept shows for its committed fan base. Now, at 10, it is considered one of the hottest shows of Milan Fashion Week. With momentum, an important investment and some hard-won prudence, its founders are at a point where -- as has historically been the case with many labels -- they move to the next level or fizzle.
Sunnei liked to use their runway shows to disrupt social conventions. They often rope the audience into complicity at events. Last season, models walked down the catwalk while voice-overs of their supposed inner thoughts played for all to hear. At a different show, the audience was armed with scoring paddles, judging each look in real time.
Another collection presentation featured Sunnei staff members modeling and then crowd-surfing off the catwalk (unknowingly mirroring Telfar). The runway events are executed with a fraction of the funds that big brands invest, but are still reliably playful, sardonic and unforgettable.
Despite their upcoming runway show on Friday and the elevated expectations of a fan base that counts on being wowed by Sunnei's left-field concepts, Mr. Rizzo and Mr. Messina remained serene.
"Our shows are a moment of catharsis," Mr. Rizzo said.
They preferred to stay mum about the details of this one, though -- "a more grown-up show for us," Mr. Rizzo said, feigning a serious face.
Yet Sunnei makes clothes for young people -- or at least, people with a sense of levity. Rendered in the bright palette of a dreamland future, Sunnei's fabrics can be stiff as if to mimic a line-drawing, or explode with fluffy surfaces resembling the pelt of a muppet. There are puffer coats, pants and sweaters that sometimes run to caricature-like proportions.
Born as a men's wear brand, Sunnei introduced women's wear in 2019, with unisex styles as well as dresses and skirts possessing all the anti-prettiness of 1990s rave gear. They are clothes that require of wearers a certain predilection for the unconventional -- a quality that's endeared Sunnei to like-minded creative spirits.
"The real secret of our success is that we're the only brand in Milan that speaks to a community, that helped create a community," Mr. Rizzo said, pausing over his plate of ravioli. "In other cities, we saw things happening that responded to how the world was changing, but Milan was missing new brands, new bars, new everything. There was nothing that reflected the international culture we saw ourselves as being a part of, so we created it."
'Social media is dead'
We walked the few blocks from the tennis club to Palazzina Sunnei, the company's three-story headquarters since 2020. Inside, Sunnei staff milled about near an extruded sculpture by Anton Alvarez, one of the many contemporary works commissioned for the offices. Angelo, the French bulldog -- Messrs. Rizzo and Messina have joint custody -- jumped up for affection as his owners arrived.
The Palazzina, a former recording studio at the end of a cul-de-sac in the residential Città Studi neighborhood, is about to become a magnet for Sunnei's community, with a flagship store opening on the ground floor later this fall. The pocket-size boutique near Bar Basso, where Sunnei initially maintained a rather cramped office, will shut down.
More than just a store, the new flagship will house Sunnei's collections alongside installations by artists and designers, as well as a cafe in the courtyard. "This is the future of retail -- a space for experience," Mr. Messina said. "At the Palazzina, you have our whole world inside. The design team can tell you about a bag, Angelo is trotting around, and just by sitting down for a coffee, you can be a part of Sunnei."
The brand might never have survived its nascent years if not for Sunnei staff's sarcasm and wit on social media and the brand's website. (The Sunnei web shop features half-nude models with their private bits blurred out.)
"We were early advocates of digitalization, but social media is dead," Mr. Rizzo said. "Today, the physical trumps digital." Big brands are aping Sunnei's online style from five years ago, he said, while Sunnei has moved on to real-life pop-ups in Berlin, Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Barcelona, and to the hangout philosophy of its flagship.
Sunnei, pronounced like "sunny" with a heavy Italian accent, began like so many design brands in the history of fashion: with a romantic partnership and a shared dream. Mr. Rizzo, originally from Calabria in southern Italy, focused on marketing and business, and Mr. Messina, whose excellent Italian belies his French origins in Grenoble, on design development. In truth, they tell me, they each do everything from designing to styling to settling payments.
"Simone and Loris are like two kids who escaped from kindergarten," said Angelo Flaccavento, a correspondent for Business of Fashion and Il Sole 24 Ore, the leading financial daily in Italy. He meant it as a compliment.
Though they are no longer a couple, the two remain "without any doubt, completely united to preserve what we created with Sunnei," Mr. Rizzo said, both of them seated now in a recording booth-turned-office where a quote by the former New York Times fashion critic Cathy Horyn was pinned to the wall: "Sunnei is the most original fashion brand in Milan after Prada ..."
'Fashion has a lot to learn from them.'
Mr. Rizzo and Mr. Messina introduced Sunnei in 2014 with 20,000 euros they'd scraped together. In 2020, they received an investment windfall of six million euros from the fledgling Vanguards group. The money helped spur the brand's expansion -- it was also the biggest challenge to preserving what they had created.
From just 10 employees, they leapfrogged to 45, and test-ran a chief executive officer. "We were convinced that with an investment firm, we had to restructure the brand in the predetermined way that they wanted," Mr. Rizzo said. "But it didn't work."
They have since shrunk Sunnei to 30 employees and sworn off C.E.O.s in favor of their personal leadership. "When money becomes the driver of what you're doing, it's ruined," Mr. Messina said. "Even the big brands ought to realize that."
At Vanguards, Peter Baldaszti, the co-founder and chief executive, led the investment revenues. "Sunnei has gone from creativity without limits to creativity within a framework, focusing their effort on a few key ideas -- a fundamental step for a creative company to succeed," he said.
The brand was losing money before Vanguards invested, but its earnings have since multiplied exponentially, with half of sales coming from Sunnei's own e-commerce, dominated by its hit accessories: Labauletto bags in cuboid shapes, hoop earrings hand-dipped with rubber blots of color and 1000Chiodi sneakers stippled with rubber nodes like freckles.
Mr. Baldaszti expects Sunnei to break even only this year -- an eye-opening reality, considering Sunnei's relative success among Milan's new generation. "Financially, fashion is a very challenging business and very capital intensive," he said. "The only way to turn a profit is to scale everything up."
Where does that leave a willfully lean and self-governed label like Sunnei? For Mr. Rizzo and Mr. Messina, it means defining victory by the survival of their project.
Mr. Flaccavento enumerated Sunnei's virtues: "spontaneity, free thinking, humor and no bull." Italy, with its skilled artisans, high-end manufacturing and powerhouse brands, is vitally important in fashion, yet lacks the gusto to cultivate new talent, he observed. "What saved Simone and Loris was keeping their brand small and independent of Milan's fashion system, while maintaining control over what they do," he said. "Fashion has a lot to learn from them."
At the Palazzina, Mr. Messina made a declaration: "Sunnei will never be a mass brand."
"We were driven by a desire to create our own system," Mr. Rizzo added. "We're artists," he said with air-quotes, then turned solemn. "And for artists, leaving a mark in history is everything."

The Men's Collections That Changed the Way We Dress: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In 2022, we compiled a list of the 25 most influential postwar women's wear collections. To do the same for men's wear, we first had to assemble a group of esteemed jurors: the Colombian-born French fashion designer Haider Ackermann; Emily Adams Bode Aujla, the American founder of Bode, a brand known for its vintage-inspired men's wear; T's men's style director, David Farber; the New York-based stylist, creative consultant and T contributor Carlos Nazario; and the New York-based Canadian photographer and creative director Tommy Ton. This past April, on a video call that lasted almost three hours, the group debated the merits of 50 collections, with each panelist making the case for the 10 or so that they'd been asked to nominate beforehand. Although there were favorites (four jurors picked at least one Giorgio Armani and Comme des Garçons collection), there were also some upsets (the inclusion of Helmut Lang over his minimalist peers Calvin Klein and Jil Sander) and a few difficult conversations. Could the group, for example, justify putting Abercrombie & Fitch, a mall retailer with a checkered past, on the same list as Junya Watanabe and Dries Van Noten?
As we worked to cut the list by half, the goal was to identify a collection's impact -- whether that was reinventing the shape of the suit or challenging what it means to "dress like a man" in the first place. That the outcome would be somewhat subjective was a given; but as always, there were rules: Similar to the women's wear list, which took Christian Dior's postwar New Look as its rough starting point, anything before 1945 was disqualified. Nor did a collection need to have been shown on a runway. Everyone agreed not to include the designs of fellow panelists, which was difficult: Bode Aujla, whose garments mix workwear with traditionally female-driven crafts such as quilting and appliqué, has been named men's wear designer of the year twice, in 2021 and 2022, by the Council of Fashion Designers of America; Ackermann, who's known for his romantic draping and sharp tailoring, just became the new creative director of Tom Ford.
In the end, this list, which appears in roughly the order it was discussed -- rather than in any kind of ranking -- is weighted toward more recent offerings, but for good reason. For much of contemporary history, male dress codes reflected a rigid and increasingly outdated notion of masculinity. In 1950, John C. Wood, the president of Brooks Brothers, one of America's oldest apparel companies, said to a reporter, "They call us conservative, but we think that our styles are simply lacking the bizarre." Even into the 1960s, it seemed like men had two basic style options: Savile Row-style tailoring or a pair of jeans. But as the definition of manhood expanded, men's wear became less predictable and more complex: In the 1970s, Vivienne Westwood's tattered shirts and spiky leather jackets epitomized the nonconformity of the punk movement; the following decade, Jean Paul Gaultier put men in skirts when such a thing raised eyebrows. But it wasn't until 2001 that the French couturier, who noticed his male clients getting pickier and more provocative about how they dressed, said, "The fashion world is now claiming that men are becoming more like women when it comes to clothes. ... I like that idea." For the most part, so did the panelists. -- Nick Haramis
The conversation has been edited and condensed.
1. Giorgio Armani, Spring 1989
In the 1980s, bigger was better -- a logic that applied to everything from hair to free-market economics. When it came to men's fashion, that meant voluminous silhouettes, which nobody did quite like Giorgio Armani. The Italian designer began making suits in the 1960s, but his clothing catapulted into American closets in 1980 when he created the wardrobe for Richard Gere's character in the Paul Schrader film "American Gigolo." (The message was clear: wearing a suit as good as that could excuse almost any bad behavior.) Over the following decade, Armani's clothes, which started out as exquisite interpretations of the classics, got progressively looser and more innovative, culminating in his spring 1989 collection, which featured double pleats, floor-skimming cuffs, wide lapels and big pockets. The lighter fabrics of the season (including wool crepe and linen) further enhanced the lack of structure and, when models wore the long double-breasted jackets -- not a shoulder pad in sight -- the slouch of the cloth recalled the hang of a pocket watch's chain. The advertising campaigns were photographed by Aldo Fallai, a frequent collaborator of Armani's, with some of the models instructed to look directly into the camera. "Giorgio developed the men's waistline, which is something nobody was doing before," Fallai said in a 2014 interview. "The waistline became wider by going higher." At 90, Armani still oversees his brand, but that 1989 collection remains the most enduring articulation of his signature style. -- Rose Courteau
David Farber: For me, there are three designers -- Giorgio Armani, Hedi Slimane and Thom Browne -- who changed the way men dressed through the silhouettes they introduced. And in all three cases, it came down to a staple: the suit. First and foremost, there's Mr. Armani, who threw everything we'd come to know about men's tailoring -- particularly from brands like Brooks Brothers, which weren't as much about comfort or ease -- out the window. Gone was the idea of a sharp crease. He introduced a kind of rumpled chic, and a ton of gray and beige.
Emily Adams Bode Aujla: The campaigns by Aldo Fallai are burned in my head; the clothes speak for themselves in those pictures. If you think about what was happening in America at that time -- "The Godfather" (1972) had come out in theaters the previous decade -- Armani's clothes were a complete rejection of what we thought of as elevated Italian fashion.
Carlos Nazario: He changed the way men presented themselves in the street. In terms of influence, he's at the top of the list.
Nick Haramis: Haider, you're the only one who didn't nominate an Armani collection.
Haider Ackermann: It crossed my mind.
2. Dior Homme by Hedi Slimane, Fall 2001
It's not an overstatement to say that Hedi Slimane altered the shape of men's wear. Before the French-born Tunisian Italian designer's first show as creative director of Dior Homme in 2001, the dominant silhouette had been looser and less constructed -- thanks in large part to the influence of Armani. Slimane raised armholes, made the silhouette slimmer, cinched waists and sent a mix of boyish professional and street-cast models down the runway. He caused such a seismic style shift that Karl Lagerfeld would later say that Slimane's clothes were the reason he felt compelled to go on a diet. In 1996, Pierre Bergé, Yves Saint Laurent's longtime partner in business and life, hired Slimane, who had no formal academic design training, to be the director of the men's collections at Saint Laurent. (He would return 16 years later as the house's artistic director.) It was there that he first introduced the world to his sexy, mysterious underground club kid look -- which also reflected his personal style. At Dior Homme, he leaned even further into his own point of view. Following his debut there, which felt more like a rock concert -- with models in sequined pants, shimmering fabrics and unbuttoned shirts -- Saint Laurent himself, who sat front row with Bergé, led a standing ovation. -- Emilia Petrarca
Farber: It was all there from the beginning -- that razor-sharp, superslim silhouette.
Nazario: I remember suddenly wanting to be really skinny.
Farber: You and Karl.
Haramis: That look had such a chokehold on anyone who lived in New York at the time.
Farber: It wasn't just special-occasion dressing; it was about who you wanted to be.
Tommy Ton: That skinny silhouette had also been attributed to Raf [Simons]. But it wasn't until Hedi took the helm at Dior Homme that the idea trickled down throughout the entire industry. It felt like there were these techno surges coming through that collection, as if it were a popular song.
3. Thom Browne, Fall 2007
In 2003, Thom Browne opened a by-appointment made-to-measure suiting business in Manhattan's West Village. Two years later, the American designer from Allentown, Pa. -- who got his start as an account executive at Giorgio Armani's New York showroom and then worked as the men's creative director of Club Monaco -- made his New York Fashion Week debut. From the start, the hallmarks of Browne's now instantly recognizable style were in evidence: shrunken proportions, a gray color palette, Pee-wee Herman-esque whimsy. But it took a few years to fully realize the Thom Browne universe as we know it today. For fall 2007, as the fourth movement of Gustav Mahler's "Symphony no. 5" played, he sent out a parade of muscular models in dramatically undersize suits and extra-long, Scrooge-like sleeping caps. There were plaid jackets and skirts, voluminous capes and even a bridal train for the finale. As the critic Tim Blanks wrote of the collection, "It's simply not possible for men's wear to ever be the same again." -- E.P.
Farber: People were very confused by those shrunken suits. Thom's publicist brought him around to meet the men's wear editors in New York. I remember her saying something like, "This guy has this new way of dressing -- a new uniform. I want you all to see it and understand it."
Ton: The number of men I've come across in every nightclub or restaurant in the past 15 years with this unflattering silhouette -- he really did change the way the everyday man dresses.
Farber: From 2007 to 2015, he also designed for Brooks Brothers Black Fleece Collection. Although it wasn't quite as exaggerated as his own line, it entered mainstream America.
Bode Aujla: I've talked to Thom about Brooks Brothers, and he told me that most people didn't know the difference between his own brand and Black Fleece. The revival of Brooks Brothers as high fashion was extremely influential; I think we must include a Thom Browne collection.
Ackermann: Too-short trousers with a too-narrow jacket is a Japanese silhouette. Thom's very influential, but this silhouette? It's Asian.
4. Comme des Garçons Homme Plus by Rei Kawakubo, Spring 1985
Comme des Garçons translates to "like the boys" but, when the designer Rei Kawakubo founded the brand in Tokyo in 1969, her focus was on women's wear. Kawakubo, who had been attracting attention beyond her native Japan for her unstructured silhouettes, ripped fabrics and dark colors, debuted a line of men's basics, Comme des Garçons Homme, in 1978. It wasn't until her spring 1985 collection, though, that she added high-end men's wear, launching her Homme Plus collection in the alleyway behind Comme des Garçons' Paris headquarters. Less gothic than her earlier creations, the clothes were modeled by artists and other creative people who walked the runway in loose, ankle-skimming trousers that alluded to traditional Japanese hakama pants. On top, she played with the silhouette of jackets, incorporating extra lining in some areas and leaving other parts unlined. Much of it was made from dyed cotton and linen in a limited palette of blue, white, black and gray. Though Kawakubo has famously rejected conventional ideas of wearability -- a women's collection from 1997, for instance, used fabric stuffing to create giant protrusions on various parts of the body -- her slouchy, nonchalant vision remains quite relevant. This 1985 collection also drew the attention of the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, who would walk in the spring Homme Plus show two years later. -- R.C.
Farber: There've been so many amazing Comme des Garçons shows, so I went back to the beginning. I can't help wondering how it must've felt to be a buyer sitting in that audience. It was like nothing people had seen before. Poetically unkempt guys everywhere found a home in those rumpled suits, untucked shirts and cropped trousers. The natural fabrics were often dyed with indigo and mud to look worn in and faded. Models were bumping into each other on the runway. Some were almost running, others seemed to be in a daydream state. It added to the mystery of the whole thing.
Ackermann: It was difficult to decide on a single collection; they're all so poetic and avant-garde. I chose spring 1999, with the ruffles and color blocking, just because it's a favorite.
Nazario: I chose spring 1987; Basquiat walked in that show, signaling the convergence of culture and fashion on the runway.
Ton: I went with fall 1993 because I'm interested in the bleached and dip-dyed treatment of the fabric. The casting of such diverse men was radical, too, particularly in the early 1990s. But I agree with David: Everything was there from the beginning.
5. Louis Vuitton by Virgil Abloh, Spring 2019
In June 2018, Virgil Abloh, Louis Vuitton's newly appointed artistic director of men's wear -- and the first Black artistic director in the house's 164-year history -- staged his first show. With the sun beating down on Paris's Palais-Royal, the American designer, a trained architect and founder of the streetwear brand Off-White, sent a cast of ethnically diverse models (and a few musician friends like Kid Cudi, Steve Lacy and Playboi Carti) down an ombré rainbow runway in sharply tailored suits with puffer jackets and hoodies. He turned bags, wallets and card holders into apparel, merging them with holsters, vests and harnesses. And in titling the show We Are the World -- a reference to the 1985 charity single written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie -- and inviting 1,500 students of all ages to sit alongside front-row regulars like Rihanna and ASAP Rocky, he made a powerful statement about the future of the industry. "There are people [here] who look like me," he told the Times. "You never saw that before in fashion." Abloh's own story ended abruptly in 2021 when he died of cancer at age 41. -- Kin Woo
Farber: I have a fond memory of being there. But looking at it again, I didn't realize how it sort of lives on from that moment to the present day. The mix of tailoring and sportswear and even accessories -- it seemed organic. Now I feel like accessories are being pushed down our throats, even if they don't always feel connected to the clothes. But here, the guy who wore that suit also had that bag. There was so much hype around that show. But when I look at it now, it's not about hype. It was about things like inclusivity. There were even touches of whimsy in the set, which had a "Wizard of Oz" theme.
Nazario: It was cheesy. We arrived onto the yellow brick road. It had all the tools to not be good. And yet it was.
Ackermann: The thing with Virgil is that it went so much further than fashion. When I analyze the clothes, then no. But was he influential? For sure.
Bode Aujla: You can't deny the influence he's had on everybody. But the prompt for this debate was the clothes, and that's why I didn't put him on my list. If someone said, "Name a figure in the world who had an influence on our culture," then I would've said Virgil for sure.
Nazario: I think he was more influential than we gave him credit for at the time. Thanks to Virgil, the type of man who really wanted to look like a man -- big and rich -- was right back in the conversation. And then there's the obvious impact of that show: the casting; the emotion in the room, which I'd never felt before and haven't felt again; and what Vuitton meant for the wearer from that moment on. It forever changed the way fashion houses choose who gets those jobs.
6. Prada by Miuccia Prada, Spring 1999
Miuccia Prada's Milan-based empire has dominated the industry since its first women's collection in 1988. But it took almost a decade for the brand to present runway shows solely dedicated to men's wear, which it did in 1997, under the direction of Mrs. Prada, as she's known, and the English designer Neil Barrett, who worked under her as design director. For the spring 1999 season, Prada's men's presentation included the runway debut of the Linea Rossa collection, which would become hugely successful. Though Prada wasn't the first luxury house to make sportswear, what it was proposing -- a quieter style that straddled the line between business casual and activewear, with none of the loud branding and logos of most athletic gear -- was wholly new. In short, this was the birth of athleisure. The collection included traditional suiting in Prada's now-signature silhouette -- a relaxed, slightly wide shoulder with shortened lapels -- as well as weekend staples like windbreakers, anoraks and ergonomic sling bags. "Our idea is to mix technology with normal dressing," Mrs. Prada said around that time. "In the long term, I see formal dressing for special occasions and an increasing number of people wearing sportswear almost all day long." -- Jameson Montgomery
Ton: It was athleisure before we knew the term. I don't think any other Italian house was showing technical sportswear like that. And when you look at the rest of the collection, all the suiting and tailoring is made using technical fabrics and paired with utilitarian bags or harnesses. It was probably Prada at its most Prada.
Nazario: So many of her clothes in the late 1990s and early 2000s were peak hot nerd, which is exactly my aesthetic.
7. Raf Simons, Fall 2001
Presented on a set of scaffolding at a warehouse in a Parisian suburb, Raf Simons's fall 2001 show marked the brand's comeback after a one-year break, during which the Belgian designer taught at a design school in Vienna. When he returned, it was clear that he'd learned a few things himself. In place of his usual tailored jackets and vests and pleated trousers, there were bulky scarves and kaffiyehs worn over layers of oversize trench coats, bomber jackets and hooded sweatshirts. Titled Riot Riot Riot, the collection was a departure from Simons's earlier attempts to make more conventional men's wear feel cool. Instead he refined the dingy uniforms of youth, creating a type of streetwear well before the term was talked about in fashion circles. To make his inspirations extra clear, Simons put patches of stills from horror movies and posters for post-punk bands on his distressed sweaters. -- J.M.
Farber: This collection was a pivot for Raf. Until then, he'd been known for slim silhouettes. But in 2001, he did a 180, going from kind of gangly to oversize everything and the idea of an urban radical. I just love that in one person, there's room for all these visions.
Nazario: Not only was it a departure for Raf -- it was a departure from what was going on in fashion.
Ackermann: Raf's great, but we should acknowledge that the oversize clothes came from youth culture. He made fashion out of it, but it came from the streets.
Nazario: Therein lies his influence. After that, we saw a lot of designers who were like, "My mom wears it like this, so that's what I'm going to do." He changed the way people approach inspiration.
8. Gucci by Tom Ford, Spring 1997
Gucci hit a rough patch in the 1980s, when a series of questionable business decisions and family infighting led to a cheapening of the brand's products and reputation. But in 1990, the Florentine fashion house found an unlikely savior: a relatively untested Texan named Tom Ford, who, at age 29, was hired to lead the women's ready-to-wear division. A success from the start, he took over men's wear soon after and was appointed creative director in 1994. Ford reimagined Gucci's runway shows, doing away with the industry-standard white cube venue and plunging audiences into darkness to ensure that all eyes were on the individually spotlighted models. For spring 1997, he presented a largely black collection for men and women that made a statement, intentional or not, about gender equality: For the most part, it was the guys who were nearly naked. Though the lineup did include high-sheen overcoats and plenty of knitwear, nearly every man with a shirt on had it unbuttoned to his navel or completely open. Sweaters were of a loose enough gauge to be almost transparent, and one was paired with only boxer briefs. Near the show's end, two models -- a man and a woman, one after the other -- came out in matching thongs each held together by the house's intersecting monogram. -- J.M.
Bode Aujla: I picked this collection largely because of that girl and guy in the G-strings. It really defined that moment in fashion advertising. Tom Ford's era at Gucci is embodied by a very specific guy we can all picture in our head. I remember him in that G-string.
Farber: I chose Tom Ford's last men's collection for Gucci in 2004. It'd been sort of a slow build for the designer, to take the Gucci guy from the collection Emily mentions -- that man in a G-string on the runway -- to someone who's sophisticated as hell. It's almost like he'd grown up just in time to say goodbye.
Nazario: The earlier collections are certainly more influential, and the one you listed, Emily, is the one that's etched in everyone's brain. How many people have redone that thong?
Ackermann: It was very sexual, that whole period. It's also something you can't do anymore.
9. Rick Owens, Fall 2009
By January 2009, when Rick Owens debuted men's wear at Paris Fashion Week, he'd already leaned into his subversive, goth aesthetic -- which falls somewhere between a Philip K. Dick novel and a desert cult. Reportedly inspired by the performance artist and singer Klaus Nomi, who had been known for his space-age style, the California-born designer cast severe-looking models, several with shaved heads, to wear the nearly all-black collection of elongated tops and drop-crotch bottoms. The clothes were much looser, more casual and, in a sense, sportier than what other designers were showing, with garments layered in the way an athlete might style shorts over leggings. Some of the shoulders were tailored to point slightly upward -- perhaps a nod to one of Owens's favorite musicians, Gene Simmons from the band Kiss. It was the opposite of Ford's glamour and Browne's uniform, and there was really nothing else like it. -- E.P.
Farber: This wasn't the one I nominated. The last number of years, Rick's shows have been so dark and moody and futuristic and gothic, which I love, but I really responded to the fall 2006 collection he showed at Pitti Uomo [in Florence, Italy]. It's this sort of merger of glamour and grunge --
Haramis: He calls it "glunge."
Farber: The sports influence that season was huge, but with beautiful tailoring and coats. He doesn't seem -- I don't want to say "bogged down by the darkness," because it's still Rick, but it's not the takeaway.
Ton: This is where I disagree with David. I think that first Paris collection solidified the statement he's made on men's wear. Starting with fall 2009, Rick has been very consistent with an elongated top, drop-crotch pants or long linear gown and stomping boots. The Pitti Uomo collection that David mentioned felt a bit more rock 'n' roll. In fall 2009, he's exploring that gothic or monastic silhouette that would go on to permeate his later collections. That's when he really started having fun.
Bode Aujla: I think Tommy's right. The clothes in that other collection just aren't as Rick defining. They're much tamer.
10. Sean John by Sean Combs, Fall 2003
In 1999, Sean Combs, who has also been known as Puff Daddy and Diddy, among other names, got the fashion world's stamp of approval in the form of a 21-page Vogue feature. With the headline "Puffy Takes Paris," the story centers the American rapper and producer -- who settled a lawsuit with his former girlfriend last year that included allegations of physical abuse and rape, and who has since been accused in multiple lawsuits of sexual abuse and other offenses, all of which he has denied -- alongside the model Kate Moss and the designers Oscar de la Renta, Jean Paul Gaultier and Karl Lagerfeld. The year before, he'd founded his own sportswear label, Sean John, one of the first of his many entrepreneurial ventures beyond music. The brand became a beacon for the convergence of fashion, hip-hop and Hollywood. Nowhere was that mix more apparent than at the fall 2003 Sean John runway show. Celebrities weren't only in the audience but also on the runway, and the then-unknown actor Channing Tatum modeled a fur-collared coat over a pair of white long underwear. The looks offered a New York rap fantasy: sunglasses-inside swagger, puffer coats and suits with silk ties. In the following months, a Sean John store opened on Fifth Avenue and Combs became the first Black person to win best men's wear designer from the CFDA. -- E.P.
Nazario: Around the time this [collection] came out, a lot of the young people I was hanging out with in downtown New York were trying to figure out what to do [with their lives]. There was this interesting convergence of art and fashion and music and culture, and Sean John was a representation of that. Before its launch, Puffy had been an arbiter of culture who could sell anything. But this was the moment when people started taking him seriously as a designer, which, for better or worse, cemented him as a presence in the fashion industry. The look -- glamorous, ostentatious and sort of tacky -- was everywhere. And I thought it was done well this season. I don't know if we can include Puffy on any list right now, but a lot of people working today, certainly from my generation [Nazario is 36], have been very influenced by Sean John -- not only by what it represented but by the aesthetic.
Bode Aujla: I agree.
Ton: You can't deny the influence of the work, regardless of the person.
Ackermann: From my part of the world, it hasn't had such a big influence. But I see where Carlos is coming from, and we're judging what the brand represented back then.
Nazario: It legitimized rap and pop culture's relationship to fashion. If I'm not mistaken, it coincided with Karl [Lagerfeld]'s hip-hop moment. Around that time, [Jennifer Lopez launched a clothing line called] Sweetface. And years later, Lindsay Lohan became an artistic adviser at Ungaro.
11. Jean Paul Gaultier, Spring 1985
Jean Paul Gaultier is best known for his corsets and conical bras, which were immortalized by Madonna on her 1990 "Blonde Ambition" tour. But while the French designer was amplifying a burlesque ideal of femininity, he was also queering gendered ideas of fashion with his spring 1985 men's collection, titled Et Dieu Créa l'Homme (And God Created Man), which included sarongs and wide-leg trousers with wrapped front panels that made them look like skirts. The year before, Gaultier had incorporated the sailor stripe into his Boy Toy collection for men, citing Rainer Werner Fassbinder's homoerotic 1982 film "Querelle" (based on the 1947 Jean Genet novel) as inspiration. Promotional images for the collection showed a tall, muscular man in a short plaid skirt standing on a dock next to a woman in a longer pant-skirt combo, their stomachs peeking out from nearly identical cropped sweaters. Although mainstream fashion didn't adopt Gaultier's then-radical concept, he was able to expand the outermost boundary of men's wear, creating space for other designers to explore and, more distantly, for the likes of Harry Styles and ASAP Rocky to experiment. -- R.C.
Farber: It can be a bit of an eye roll now to hear about skirts on the runway. But this wasn't "[RuPaul's] Drag Race"; Gaultier designed trousers with a front panel to give them the illusion of a skirt.
Ton: That collection was a predecessor to all the gender-fluid clothes we see today. It wasn't done for the sake of putting a man in a skirt. It was about removing the idea of gender identity altogether, and it precedes Thom Browne showing his suits with skirts, or Hood by Air. It set the tone for what we see today as modern men's fashion.
Haramis: Haider, you designed a couture collection last year for Jean Paul Gaultier, but this wasn't on your list.
Ackermann: Perhaps that's because I'm not as attracted to things that are gender fluid. I grew up in Africa, and my whole childhood I saw many men in skirts. So for me, there was nothing new about it.
12. Hood by Air by Shayne Oliver, Fall 2014
In 2006, Shayne Oliver co-founded Hood by Air with Raul Lopez (who later branched out with his own brand, Luar) to dress their own community of cool, androgynous New York club kids. But the Hood by Air shows transcended their network: They made New York runways feel vitally connected to the city itself. Oliver's gender-fluid fall 2014 show at Pier 60 ended with several dancers paying tribute to the modern ballroom scene, an influential community of queer Black and Latino drag performers, with roots in America dating back to the 19th century. The dancers wore jeans that were covered in zippers and the brand's logo; bondage-like straps flung around the models' legs and wigs whipped around their heads. The performance complemented the electric day-to-night feeling of the collection, with its leather jackets, oversize graphic tees and sweatsuits spliced with laces. "I went to high school with all these guys out there vogueing today," Oliver told Vogue after the show. "The way I view design comes from the aesthetic of being at a ball." -- Jessica Testa
Nazario: This was the moment when everyone was like, "What is this?" It was so charged and messy, borderline vulgar. The vision was fully realized, but the budgets were just so small. And that was its charm. I think it really influenced the way that fashion used communities, the way that clothes were presented and who was allowed to have an opinion. Shayne was influenced by what was happening in Europe; it's probably valid to say there was a conversation going on between Shayne, Rick [Owens] and Riccardo [Tisci]. But I don't think Hood by Air was referencing them. Maybe it was referencing the things they were referencing.
Ton: It was a teaser for what was to come in the New York landscape. He was a decade early. Streetwear had been popularized by luxury fashion, but what Shayne did was steeped in ball culture and queer culture.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Nazario: He added to the conversation about gender fluidity, or whatever the correct marketing term for it is. Nowadays it can feel like a revelation when Miu Miu has clothes that look good on a man and a woman, or when its shows use a trans model. Shayne arrived a bit early.
Ackermann: It's interesting to listen to you because I come from such a different background. I mean, of course we're different generations, but it's also very American. Vogueing is very attractive and interesting to me. But I don't know if this had as much of an impact on fashion as it had on the moment.
13. Givenchy by Riccardo Tisci, Fall 2011
Givenchy's fall 2011 men's show was plagued by technical difficulties -- including a power outage that caused a 90-minute delay -- but few remember that now. Instead, the collection endures for its introduction of one of Riccardo Tisci's signatures: the Rottweiler. Splashy, menacing images of the dog appeared on sweatshirts, scarves and shorts -- though the Italian designer later played down the breed's ferocity, saying that Rottweilers represent "power and sweetness." The black jersey shirts were particularly favored by Rihanna, Usher and several members of the Kardashian-Jenner family, who wore them in numerous paparazzi photos. It's now a requirement for designers to have street credibility and a crew of famous friends, but that started with Tisci's 12-year reign at Givenchy. (He began by overseeing the couture and women's lines in 2005 and added men's wear in 2008.) Dark and seductive, his Givenchy was also slyly witty: That 2011 collection included fuzzy hats with dog ears. -- J.T.
Ton: It was a pivotal moment to see a luxury house like Givenchy tackling streetwear. And you could feel its impact right away: Suddenly, everyone was wearing the hoodies and T-shirts.
Farber: And they were well made. Tisci set the bar for what luxury streetwear should be.
Nazario: It was deceptively simple, but it wasn't really athleisure. Whether or not you love Riccardo's aesthetic, he's a true designer. If it's a pair of basketball shorts on the runway, it's not just a pair of basketball shorts. It's made with the best fabrics. As for the Rottweiler, it became a ubiquitous status symbol.
14. Adam Kimmel, Spring 2010
Adam Kimmel's fashion career was brief -- he took a one-year hiatus in 2012 to pursue other projects, and never returned -- but he left a lasting impression. After graduating from New York University in 2001, the American designer traveled to Italy to work with tailors and patternmakers and returned home with a small collection of thoughtfully constructed essentials. Three weeks later, he threw his latest collection in a duffel bag and flew to Paris to try to sell it. (The store Colette bought almost everything; eventually, the brand was carried at Bergdorf Goodman and then Dover Street Market, following a studio visit from Rei Kawakubo herself.) Kimmel made clothes that evoked larger-than-life characters. For his early look books, he and his half brother, the photographer Alexei Hay, played dress up with their friends: the actor Dennis Hopper and the artists Ryan McGinley, John Baldessari and Dan Colen. In later seasons, his presentations were increasingly cinematic, demonstrating his showmanship and range. Spring 2010, one of the brand's last collections, channeled a Western aesthetic with suede chaps and denim coveralls. Jim Krantz, who photographed original Marlboro Man ads, shot the collection on real cowboys on a ranch in New Mexico; in an accompanying video by the director Meredith Danluck, the bull rider Rocky McDonald mounted a bucking bronco in a Kimmel tuxedo. -- E.P.
Ackermann: These days, there're so many collections based on outerwear. But Adam took a U-turn by using the same photographer [Jim Krantz] who shot some of the advertising for Marlboro. Consistently, he elevated these very quiet outerwear collections into something elegant and beautiful.
Bode Aujla: The unfussy apparel aspect of men's wear is why I put him on my list. If you look at the clothes, it's all made in Italy, some of it out of cashmere, but it's cool. Even the way he presented his collections, it looked like he picked these people off the street. That way of casting had been done before with Comme des Garçons, but this was a new iteration because it was clothes you'd find people wearing.
Haramis: When I first moved to New York, I had the pictures from this campaign on the walls of my bedroom.
Bode Aujla: It was a strong vision of luxury for this new downtown guy. I almost added a third collection of his, but I was like, "I can't have only Ralph Lauren and Adam Kimmel on my list."
15. Polo Ralph Lauren by Ralph Lauren, 1974 (the Costumes for "The Great Gatsby")
Over the past half-century, Ralph Lauren has contributed more to the iconography of American fashion than perhaps any other designer, delivering season after season of sporty, luxurious clothing that manages to conjure both East Coast aristocracy and the Western frontier. In 1968, Lauren, who was born Ralph Lipschitz in the Bronx, came out with his first Polo label collection. (Despite never having played the sport, he loved its style.) He quickly became known for textured fabrics -- tweed, silk, corduroy -- and relaxed tailoring, as epitomized by his unstructured Easy Suit, introduced in 1970. "The coat feels like a shirt and looks like a jacket," he said. In 1974, he released a collection of double-breasted waistcoats, suits with big lapels and wide ties that Robert Redford wore in that year's film adaptation of the 1925 F. Scott Fitzgerald novel "The Great Gatsby." "My clothes are all about a mood and style I like," he told Oprah Winfrey in 2002. "It's all about creating a dream I'd want for myself." -- R.C.
Haramis: Emily, you alone nominated four Ralph Lauren collections.
Bode Aujla: I think 1974 is the most interesting because of what was happening in America. A year or so earlier, the U.S. military had left Vietnam. Meanwhile, Ralph offered an escapist collection that appeared in "The Great Gatsby." He shifted the way men dressed, instead of leaning toward what was happening in the world at the time.
Ackermann: I've always secretly dreamed of working for him -- that's how much I admire him. You enter a Ralph Lauren shop and it's like entering his entire universe. He's stayed very truthful to himself, and he continues, almost stubbornly, down his own path.
Nazario: There's nothing to say about Ralph that hasn't been said. We can't do a list like this without including him on it.
16. Seditionaries by Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren, 1976
Today, it's common for designers to collaborate with musicians, but that wasn't the case in the 1970s, when Vivienne Westwood and her romantic partner at the time, the musician and band promoter Malcolm McLaren, opened a shop in London's Chelsea neighborhood for young people who had tired of flower power. They changed the store's name several times before landing, in 1976, on Seditionaries. By then, the Sex Pistols, whom McLaren managed, were wearing clothes from the shop. In 1977, the group's song "God Save the Queen," which was banned from the BBC, inspired an iconic Seditionaries shirt featuring an image of Queen Elizabeth II with a safety pin piercing her lips. More intricately detailed pieces included the famous bondage suit from the 1976 collection, a unisex ensemble with an abundance of zippers and buckles. It's hard to overstate the enduring influence of the Seditionaries look -- defined by metal spikes, exposed seams and intentionally distressed fabrics -- not just on the aesthetics of 20th-century music but on high fashion, too. -- R.C.
Ton: Thinking about the '70s, I'm surprised none of us nominated Vivienne Westwood's 1976 Seditionaries collection because she practically invented punk. A lot of the designers on our list wouldn't be around if it weren't for her.
Bode Aujla: I think that's why the Raf one was confusing to me, because he's riffing on the culture she helped create.
Nazario: I agree about that collection.
Haramis: Let's add it, then.
17. Abercrombie & Fitch, Fall 1996
In the 1990s and early aughts, Abercrombie & Fitch was the official outfitter of the suburban American teen. Two decades earlier, though, in 1976, the company had filed for bankruptcy. It found its footing again in 1992, when a new chief executive, Mike Jeffries, was hired following the brand's purchase a few years earlier by the Limited, Inc. His plan: to attract adolescent customers with a sexy take on collegiate Americana involving rugby polos, cargo shorts and a lot of plaid. The company commissioned the photographer Bruce Weber to shoot black-and-white, often homoerotic pictures that were printed on shopping bags and lined the walls of Abercrombie's cologne-scented, wood-paneled stores, where customers were usually met by shirtless male greeters. The company was later criticized for its exclusionary marketing and hiring practices, which favored slim, white models and employees and, earlier this year, the F.B.I. launched an investigation into claims that Jeffries sexually abused several men between 2009 and 2015; Jeffries has denied these claims. (A lawsuit against Weber accusing him of misconduct toward several male models was settled in 2021.) Recently, Abercrombie has undergone yet another successful rebrand with more sophisticated clothes for a slightly older clientele: In the first quarter of 2024, sales were up 31 percent over the year before. And yet, as cargo shorts return to the runway once more, the influence that Abercrombie had on young millennials -- and on men's style -- is hard to deny. -- J.M.
Bode Aujla: This collection, and the campaign Bruce orchestrated, was so brilliant, although problematic. This was the year that Mike Jeffries took A&F public, which is totally wild. The company was hemorrhaging millions and millions of dollars, and then it was on its way to making billions. Just this one campaign provided an identity for so many American and international kids.
Farber: It's a collection, but it's also a spirit.
Nazario: These were some of the first fashion pictures I remember making an impression on me. But I don't know what its inclusion says about fashion.
Haramis: I don't know what it says about high fashion, but I do think it was emblematic of how a lot of people dressed for a time.
Nazario: And maybe it trickled up. I remember one Dsquared2 show in Milan with extremely low-rise jeans paired with a bikini top, a plaid shirt and a trucker hat, which was an Abercrombie uniform.
18. Gucci by Alessandro Michele, Fall 2015
According to legend, in January 2015 -- following the surprise departure of Frida Giannini, Gucci's creative director since 2006 -- Alessandro Michele, who had previously served as Giannini's associate, scrapped the men's wear collection that she'd been working on and pulled together an entirely new one in just five days. From the moment the first model came out in Milan wearing a red silk pussy-bow blouse with loose cotton pants and fur-lined sandals, it was clear that the Italian designer had cast aside Giannini's jet-set aesthetic in favor of his own vintage-inspired vision. Romantic and exuberantly androgynous, the collection featured wool berets, skinny scarves and lace tops, all worn by willowy models. Two days after his first men's show, Michele was appointed creative director of the brand, a position he would hold for nearly eight years before stepping down in 2022. As Frank Bruni wrote for T in 2018, "He isn't just selling robes, slippers, handbags, things, though he certainly wants customers to buy those, which they've done in numbers that have returned Gucci to peak cultural relevance and extraordinary financial success. He's selling a sensibility: eccentric, eclectic, inclusive." (And one that was exuberantly bizarre: he'd sometimes send out models with their identical twins or carrying silicone heads that looked just like theirs.) Only two months after being announced as the creative director of Valentino this past March, Michele unexpectedly dropped a resort collection of 171 ready-to-wear looks. -- K.W.
Farber: I never thought this would be on my list. I'll admit it: I didn't get how these thrift-store pussy-bow blouses were going to work for men's wear moving forward. But I included it because of how many other designers it influenced.
Haramis: If I'm not mistaken, lots of people walked out of that show feeling confused.
Farber: As I talked to other fashion editors, the consensus seemed to be, "Wait, what?"
Nazario: It was so bold and confident -- and such a middle finger to what [Gucci] had been. I remember leading up to that moment, there was a minimal, dry "I'm rich and I have no opinion" thing starting to happen. And then Michele arrived, and everything changed. Suddenly, everything felt a bit bohemian and homemade. It wasn't a look that I loved or could get behind, but the impact was immediate.
19. Lanvin by Lucas Ossendrijver, Spring 2011
In 2001, when Alber Elbaz joined Lanvin, he transformed what was then a troubled 112-year-old French brand into a purveyor of highly coveted women's wear. A few years later, the label hired the Dutch designer Lucas Ossendrijver, hoping that he'd do the same for men's wear. While Elbaz was best known for his festive, formal attire, Ossendrijver, who had previously worked under Slimane at Dior Homme, was interested in "lived-in" clothes, he told T in 2008; he found traditional suits "boring." By the summer of 2010, when he showed his spring 2011 collection in Paris, he'd refined a casual yet elegant aesthetic inspired by activewear and aerodynamic design. Semi-sheer tops twisted around torsos. Hems and seams were left raw. Fabrics were tactile, some of them stiff and ridged and others imprinted with swirls and stripes. The athletic sandals combined lizard skin with sporty straps. Long sleeveless jackets were worn over bare chests, accessorized with metallic studded necklaces. Commercial success followed, pushing Lanvin further toward cultural relevance. In 2010, H&M released a very popular men's and women's collaboration with the brand and, in 2013, Lanvin became the official tailor of England's Arsenal Football Club. After 14 years at the brand, Ossendrijver left the company in 2018 amid restructuring. Lanvin, which hasn't staged a designated men's show since then, recently appointed Peter Copping as its new artistic director. -- J.T.
Ackermann: Lucas's work was so innovative. The fabrics were modern, the cuts were very sharp, and the shapes and colors were amazing. Everything was very technical, even if it didn't look like it.
Nazario: There was the brand's impact on the street, as well. The Lanvin sneaker was such a huge status symbol in New York. Lucas's fashion -- that technical, sporty, Belgian-meets-Japanese thing that he did -- was being replicated everywhere.
20. Ann Demeulemeester, Spring 2014
Isn't it a delight when a designer goes off-script? Ann Demeulemeester was a member of the Antwerp Six, the experimental group of Belgian fashion designers that included Walter Van Beirendonck and Dries Van Noten. She held her first Paris runway show in 1991, adding men's wear in 1996, and through it all delivered goth nobility: Her clothing was moody, sophisticated and often black. But for her spring 2014 men's wear collection, the designer surprised her audience with florals. Though the blooms were ebony-hued, the wisteria appliqués creeping down the tongues of white shoes and swirling around the chests of blush pink vests were also distinctly pretty. The collection evoked Edwardian tea parties, with domed hats, three-piece suits and vertical stripes -- some barely visible beneath buttoned tailcoats and others blaring from trousers. It was unexpectedly whimsical, even Tim Burton-esque. (One journalist used the description "Beetlejuice stripes.") "This is private Ann, on Sundays," Demeulemeester told Vogue at the time. "People don't know, but I love my garden." It was her last men's collection before stepping away from the brand. -- J.T.
Ackermann: It's clothes with a soul, and maybe I've been missing that. Of course, there are good collections nowadays, but one that really moves you -- I have old Ann Demeulemeester pieces that I'll never throw away. The construction, the patterns, the attitude of the hanging shoulders: You felt like PJ Harvey and Patti Smith, embracing masculinity but being feminine at the same time
Nazario: Ann is an unsung hero. She's beloved in the design community, but not as well regarded on a global or commercial level as I think she should be. I keep coming back to that word "influential." And my question is, "Influential to whom?" She really changed what people wanted to look like.
Ackermann: I need to make it clear that I'm talking about Ann Demeulemeester by Ann Demeulemeester. After she left, it was a different story.
21. Junya Watanabe, Fall 2014
The expression "business in the front, party in the back" was coined to describe mullets -- which were on full display at Junya Watanabe's fall 2014 men's wear show in Paris. Some models wore Ziggy Stardust hairstyles; others had mod moptops. A few wore wigs that looked intentionally halfhearted, as if they'd been sourced from a cheap costume store. A tweed jacket, worn over a polka-dot tie, was fastened with a safety pin. Punkish snagged sweaters were layered over sensible shirts. A top hat and brogues complemented jeans covered in plaid patches. It was a city kid remix of Ralph Lauren's Anglophilia, and the dichotomy was irresistible. Over two decades since Watanabe had shown his first women's wear collection in Paris, the private Japanese designer was still doing what he did best: turning everyday garments into surprising pieces that lit up his audience's imagination. -- J.T.
Ackermann: I could have chosen any Junya Watanabe collection. He's got a certain rock attitude, although it's very different from Demeulemeester's. He made outerwear fashionable with those beautiful collaborations with the North Face and Canada Goose. I'm impressed by whatever he does.
Farber: I feel the same way. The one I chose, fall 2015, was probably his most upbeat. I think I smiled throughout that entire show, which was basically celebrating formal wear. But as brilliant as fall 2015 was, I think there's a greater arc to fall 2014 -- more of the world of Junya.
Ackermann: What's interesting about Watanabe is that you can wear his clothes 20 years later. You have this with a lot of Japanese designers: They remain in time.
Nazario: It's one of the few labels I don't get rid of, and I get rid of everything.
22. Dries Van Noten, Fall 2016
Over the course of his 38-year career, the Belgian designer Dries Van Noten created a colorful, poetic style that pulled inspiration from different cultures and eras. At his fall 2016 men's wear show, that rich-bohemian romanticism found its ideal habitat: the Palais Garnier opera house in Paris, a venue that he'd been trying to book for 15 years. He told Vogue at the time that he wanted to create a collection that matched its grandeur. "For me it was really good to be able to show here onstage and not in a room," he said. "It turns your world a little bit upside down." According to the show notes, Van Noten based the clothes on a central character that he referred to as a "Peacock Peacenik," and looked to the psychedelic imagery of the 1960s to inform many of his designs. Some coats were covered with swirly, hallucinogenic graphics by the artist Wes Wilson, who designed fliers for Ken Kesey's original acid tests, others with military ribbons and symbols. Van Noten's spring 2025 men's wear show this past June was his last one. In a letter posted to his fans, he wrote, "My dream was to have a voice in fashion. That dream came true." -- K.W.
Bode Aujla: I think it's important to include him. He's a designer's designer.
Farber: I loved Dries's shows, but I also thought about shopping when I was at them. And there's not a ton of that on this list. I aspire to wear his clothes. The experience of seeing this collection is ingrained in my mind. We walked up to this massive, gorgeous structure and were escorted around the back. We then went up a creaky staircase and through a little door, which is when we realized that we were on the stage of this amazing architectural gem. The collection was in part military inspired, so there's an officer's coat and lots of olive. Eventually, we started to see some embellishment -- maybe an embroidered snake down one arm. The crescendo was just magnificent. It went from zero to 100 in 15 minutes.
23. Helmut Lang, Spring 1998
Helmut Lang grew up in Austria at a time when Europe, still rebuilding after World War II, was obsessed with American cultural exports like rock music, cowboy movies and denim. Tired of wearing hand-me-down suits to school, he learned to sew his own jeans. When he founded his own line in Paris in 1986, he focused on the clean-lined, workwear-like silhouettes that defined his youth. America was an enduring creative touchstone for the designer; in 1997, he moved his business to New York and, that summer, he showed the spring 1998 collection, his first dedicated to men's wear. The lineup of largely black-and-white tailoring included vests that resembled bulletproof tactical gear, utilitarian belts worn like cummerbunds and lots of denim, most notably in the form of Lang's famous paint-splattered carpenter jeans, which inspired countless imitations. In promoting garments of humble American origin, Lang challenged the supremacy of European fashion; the following year, he even pushed the date of his women's show up a month to precede the ones in Milan and Paris. Other designers soon followed his lead and New York has been first on the official fashion calendar ever since. -- J.M.
Farber: Jil Sander and Calvin Klein's influence on men's wear was huge, but I chose Helmut because he took that minimalism and built on it. Over the years, he played with punk and New Wave influences. There's so much in this spring 1998 collection: sharp tailoring and monochrome dressing, but also the idea of modern armor with the inclusion of a padded bulletproof vest and suiting with a distressed denim jacket and paint-splattered jeans.
Nazario: It felt like the convergence of a lot of things that were happening in fashion, but in a very concise way. And I love the introduction of a lot of urban styling cues like wearing a tank top underneath a white shirt. From that time forward, I don't think there's been a moment when Helmut wasn't a part of the conversation.
Ton: To me, 1998 was the year of Helmut. The unfussiness of a simple suit contrasted with utilitarian garments like a worker vest was such an interesting proposition. This collection also merged high fashion with streetwear.
Ackermann: I've gone to a few of his shows; the models seemed to walk straight at you. There was no gimmick. You either liked him or you didn't, but you couldn't ignore him.
24. Grace Wales Bonner, Fall 2015
Since launching her brand a decade ago, the British Jamaican designer Grace Wales Bonner has approached her work as an exploration of ancestry and identity. In January 2015, when she was 24, she debuted her clothes, which bring together indigenous craft techniques, including Indian quilting, Ghanaian beading and Burkinabe weaving with Savile Row-like tailoring, as part of the emerging designer showcase Fashion East at London Fashion Week. Wales Bonner -- who has since curated exhibitions at New York's Museum of Modern Art and London's Serpentine North Gallery -- sought inspiration for the collection, titled Ebonics, in the work of Black writers and artists like Langston Hughes and Marlon Riggs. She subverted expectations about gender and class with combinations such as a silk cummerbund with a pinstriped-denim suit and a halter top with high-waisted trousers or a mushroom-colored, crushed velvet suit embellished with cowrie shells and Swarovski crystals. -- K.W.
Farber: I remember being in London with a colleague who said, "We should go see this new designer Grace Wales Bonner." I didn't know anything about her. I walked in and was instantly transported somewhere else. Some of the men were wearing pieces of crushed velvet; others had embroidered jewels and shells, which I later discovered were once a form of African currency. In the show notes, Grace wrote, "This collection was quite historical, going further into the history of how Black people were represented in paintings in the 19th century, and how that manifests itself today. It's about looking back and then looking forward." To be so young and to carry that kind of weight -- I'm not surprised by how successful a career she's had.
Nazario: I'm a big Grace fan, and I think the way she makes work inspires a lot of designers.
25. Craig Green, Spring 2015
In 2012, when the British designer Craig Green founded his label after graduating from Central Saint Martins in London, he attracted attention with provocative elements like face masks made from wooden planks, which the press ridiculed. But for his spring 2015 show, Green stripped back the conceptual statements and focused instead on the construction, telling Dazed magazine that he wanted the clothes "to feel beautiful, in a way." The core of the collection was a utilitarian workwear jacket made of cotton, nylon and tarpaulin that he interpreted in a limited palette of white, black and a supersaturated cornflower blue. Worn by barefoot models who emerged to a melancholic soundtrack that included the Irish New Age singer Enya, the garment looked almost delicate, with strings that tied at the front. Elsewhere, it was reimagined as padded armor and paired with loose, karate-style trousers that evoked the work of Yohji Yamamoto. Several members of the audience were seen in tears. -- K.W.
Farber: I didn't know what to expect. Then these barefoot boys came out, and there was something so pure and poetic about this collection -- it spoke its own language. It wasn't sportswear or tailoring as I'd known it. It was fabric that wrapped around the body with no zippers -- just little ties to hold it together. I remember having this image of young warriors returning from, or heading off to, battle.
Ton: Like David was saying, it's almost art in motion. It didn't necessarily feel like clothes.
Farber: And I do think there was something about being in the room, because when you just look at images of the clothes, I don't know if it carries the same weight. In photos, you might ask yourself, "Where, how and when would I put that on my body?" But that wasn't part of the dialogue in that room. It was like, "Bring the beauty. We want this. We need this."

Free Booze, a Lake Cruise and Selfies Galore: How Democrats Courted Influencers at the DNC

CHICAGO — Last month, Kristin Brey, a podcaster, radio host and newspaper columnist, attended the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee as a credentialed journalist. She set up shop in a dank hockey arena, jostled in scrums with reporters for interviews and often could not get access to the floor of the convention hall because there was not enough space.
This week, she traveled to Chicago for the Democratic National Convention, under a new title. No longer labeled a journalist, Brey was now a “content creator” — better known as an influencer — and it proved to be a sizable upgrade.
She and other creators got face time with Gwen Walz, the wife of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, aboard a private boat on Lake Michigan; they were treated to tiki bar parties and catered rooftop luncheons; they had exclusive access to two private lounges and a penthouse suite in the United Center that were stocked with free food and alcohol; and many were offered one-on-one interviews with some of the Democratic Party’s biggest names. Some of the influencers, although not Brey, received free airfare and hotel rooms.
Three of them interviewed Vice President Kamala Harris, who has not sat for a mainstream media interview since becoming her party’s nominee for president.
The two experiences were “wildly different,” noted Brey as she stood in a special box made for influencers on the convention floor Tuesday night.
The treatment was part of an elaborate and unprecedented campaign to flood social media with positive messages about Harris and Walz as they accepted their party’s nominations this week. Democrats treated influencers like celebrities, hoping that free stuff and copious access in Chicago would reap buzzy posts on Instagram, TikTok or YouTube, the primary sources of news for a crucial, and growing, slice of voters.
Some 200 content creators were given the special passes to the convention — a credential akin to those given to members of the news media but with additional benefits. (By contrast, the party credentialed some 15,000 journalists, who pay for their workspace and accommodations.) Progressive nonprofits and other outside groups picked up the travel tab for many of the influencers, while underwriting an itinerary of daytime panels and nighttime soirees, as well as an abundance of swag.
Republicans are also using influencers to make inroads among the highly online. At their party’s national convention last month, more than 70 influencers were credentialed, and former President Donald Trump has sat for interviews with a number of social media stars.
Both parties sees influencers as the best conduit to young millennial and Generation Z voters. Critics say their expanding role is blurring the line between journalism and advocacy.
Unlike Brey, most of the creators who attended the Democratic convention do not consider themselves journalists and have set no code of ethics or independence. Their currency is attention, which is how they accumulate followers, and many earn income by promoting commercial products to them.
This week, the product was Harris.
John Wihbey, a professor of journalism and media innovation at Northeastern University, said it made sense that the party would reach out to influencers.
“In some ways, this is long overdue considering how fast the culture moves. You get exposure to a key demographic that the party absolutely has to turn out,” he said. “But it’s assumed that they will carry the water the party wants them to, and if organizers aren’t distinguishing between them and journalists, that would be a mistake.”
The passes distributed to influencers this week, like those given to journalists, identified attendees as “producer,” “editor” or “reporter.”
Emily Soong, a spokesperson for the Democratic National Convention said that “Democrats value a free press, and our convention is a reflection of that.”
Jeremy Jacobowitz, a New York-based food influencer whose posts about gut-busting food from around the world have earned him more than 800,000 followers between TikTok and Instagram, said he would never call himself a reporter. He openly supports Democratic candidates, has posted pictures of himself with President Joe Biden and was tickled to receive an invitation to come to the convention as a credentialed creator.
So when organizers offered Jacobowitz one-on-one interviews with a parade of public figures, he jumped at the chance. For an hour on Tuesday night he asked politicians: “If you could describe Kamala as a dish and/or Trump as a dish, what would it be?”
“I know why they want me here,” Jacobowitz said. “I’m not here to ask any embarrassing questions.”
Before coming to Chicago, credentialed creators were emailed lists of Democratic surrogates available for interviews, and each night influencers were given time on the “blue carpet” inside the United Center where politicians such as Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Stacey Abrams, a former candidate for governor of Georgia, posed for selfies.
Carlos Eduardo Espina, who has more than 10 million followers on TikTok and posts in Spanish, recorded a conversation with Harris on Tuesday, asking her to make her case for why Hispanics should vote for her. The next night, Espina spoke about immigration from the main stage at the convention. The vice president spoke on camera with two other influencers this week, according to the campaign.
On Monday, more than 150 of those creators clambered aboard the Spirit of Chicago, docked at Navy Pier. Gwen Walz mingled and posed for selfies before sending them off on a three-hour “Creators for Kamala Yacht Party.” The Harris campaign paid for the event, which was closed to the press. Guests included Meena Harris, the vice president’s niece.
Deja Foxx, an influencer and abortion-rights advocate, arrived for the party wearing Prada head to toe — sent to Chicago by her agency, Ford Models. She has some 200,000 followers across TikTok and Facebook.
“This is so exciting,” Foxx said, heading up the gangplank.
Since then she has posted several videos spotlighting her outfits (she declined one of the camouflage Harris-Walz hats being handed out), including the three-piece Argent pantsuit she wore when she addressed the convention on Monday. “This is going to be the most important outfit video I make this entire convention,” she said in the video.
In her remarks, delivered from the creators’ box on the convention floor, Foxx talked about reproductive rights and student debt, proclaiming that “we need Kamala Harris.” On Tuesday, she hosted a party, Hotties for Harris, that drew Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida and David Hogg, a gun-control activist.
The Harris campaign said it did not directly pay influencers for content. But other Democratic groups do pay for posts, typically providing talking points or other guidelines. Depending on the reach of the creator, payments can be as little as $50 or, in some cases, tens of thousands of dollars.
Nicholas Kitchel, the director of digital partnerships at the Hub Project, a progressive nonprofit, said that the group funds some campaigns that pay influencers for content. He said paying creators was part of a strategy aimed at the “democratization of media.” His group requires influencers to disclose their sponsorship, he said, but many other groups do not.
This week, the Hub Project covered the travel expenses for 22 creators and paid for a rooftop lunchtime party with an open bar on Tuesday. Good Influence, which calls itself an influencer advocacy network, covered the travel costs of 25 other creators who were in Chicago this week.
Kitchel said the goal of such efforts was to “build community.”
With more than 32 million followers on TikTok, 16 million on YouTube and another 3 million on Instagram, Merrick Hanna was not just one of the biggest creators at the convention this week — he also ranks among the largest influencers in the world. But at just 19 years old, he was too young to go to the late-night events organized for creators this week.
Hanna, a former contestant on “America’s Got Talent,” said he was surprised to get an invitation to go to Chicago because his content — almost exclusively videos of him dancing — is completely nonpolitical.
Hours before the first speaker took the lectern on Tuesday night, Hanna and his father, Shawn, who traveled with him, were roaming the second level of the United Center, filming a series of dance moves that they planned to stitch together into a post.
The elder Hanna said that they hoped to use their presence at the convention to encourage people to vote, but that they did not want to “get political” by endorsing any particular candidates or party for fear of turning off followers with different views.
Still, he mused, “it would be great to do a livestream with AOC,” using the initials for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.
At the other end of the spectrum, influence-wise, was Abbie McAdams, a recent college graduate from Colorado who runs a nonprofit that advocates broader access to menstrual products. She said she was shocked to get a creator credential since she had a very small online following.
“Somehow they decided to let a 21-year-old girl with only 200 followers on TikTok go to the Democratic National Convention,” McAdams posted online last weekend. “I’ll literally be in the same place as the press with access to people like Kamala Harris, Tim Walz” and others in the party.
McAdams paid her own way to Chicago, she said in an interview, and tried to make the most of her time in Chicago, rushing from event to event and posting nearly in real time about all she observed. Although she did not have a chance to interview the Democratic nominee for president, she said, she had some star-struck moments — meeting other influencers.
“Being able to meet Deja Foxx in person and have a conversation with her was special,” McAdams said.

Full text: Christoph Büchel's vast installation in Venice is compelling, obsessive and sometimes hilarious.
Ascending the grand marble staircase in the center of the Venetian palazzo, you encounter a selection of fake Gucci, Hermes and other luxury handbags laid out on a blanket. A street hawker seems to have been disturbed, leaving their knockoff wares behind.
Then, turning right on the mezzanine level, you climb another staircase into a control room. A bank of live CCTV monitors flicker above an empty office chair and espresso-stained plastic coffee cup.
Next, a room for cryptocurrency traders with whirring servers, and a fridge, quarter-filled with tins of Red Bull; followed by the recording studio of a grandmother-aged TikTok influencer; a washroom with a print of Leonardo's $ 450.3 million "Salvator Mundi" pasted to the wall; a 1950s-style cocktail bar; a pole dancing den; a kitchen filled with untouched trash. Room after room looks recently abandoned.
These are just a few of the many elements of "Monte di Pietà," a sprawling, multilayered project by the Swiss-born artist Christoph Büchel, 57, at The Prada Foundation in Venice through Nov. 24. Though not part of the official Biennale program, this is currently the most-talked about art project in Venice, compelling in its obsessive, allusive and sometimes hilarious attention to detail. Never shy of taking on big subjects, Büchel has created an immersive environment that asks awkward, urgent questions about what capitalism is doing to our society and our planet.
To do this, the artist transformed the first three floors of Ca' Corner della Regina, an 18th-century palace that the Prada Foundation now owns, into the venue for a fictional liquidation auction of a bankrupt "Venice Pawn Shop." From 1834 to 1969, the palazzo, overlooking the Grand Canal, was the home of the "Mount of Piety," a Catholic institution that made loans to low-income borrowers who offered their valuables as collateral.
Büchel has imagined this lending facility as if it has just gone bust. The borrowers' deposited belongings are up for auction and the palazzo is boarded up and covered with "For Sale" signs. The property is a "great investment opportunity," according to the deadpan accompanying brochure, styled like a bankruptcy court auction catalog.
Büchel does not give media interviews. But the material the artist has chosen for this project has plenty to say about the troubled world we live in, and the roles that capital, debt, spurious notions of value and naked greed have played over the centuries.
Jarring juxtapositions of objects are everywhere. An entire room full of vellum-bound banking records, dating back to the 16th century, is placed next to a job lot of washing machines and dryers. An authentic 1542 Titian portrait, from the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, hangs on a pegboard panel beside a plastic coat hanger. Büchel's ongoing work "The Diamond Maker," consisting of a suitcase filled with a collection of lab-grown diamonds made out of his own destroyed art (he used his own excrement as the organic "starter" for the gems series) is displayed near six original tins of Piero Manzoni's 1961 fecal masterwork, "Merda d'artista." An 18th-century map of Ukraine hangs next to some assault rifles.
A Lehman Brothers sign stands on its side behind a screen indicating the current state of world debt (currently more than $ 72 trillion, according to Worlddebtclocks.com). An official portrait of a smiling Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy is placed on a cardboard box next to the ground floor restrooms. A palace, owned by one of the world's most powerful luxury fashion brands, is filled with the thrift store smell of old clothes. In the current economic climate, it is difficult to imagine a publicly funded museum having the resources to mount this kind of exhibition. Chiara Costa, the head of programs at the Prada Foundation, said in an email that her team had spent two years working with Büchel to research and produce this project.
Over the last 30 years, the Foundation has often commissioned "utopian projects that are seemingly impossible to realize," according to Costa. "Monte di Pietà" pushes this mission even further, since "Büchel's work tends to force the limits of an art institution," she added, referring to the daunting challenges posed by the artist's notoriously ambitious and provocative installations.
Unlike Büchel's more ill-fated schemes -- including the unrealized "Training Ground for Democracy," a would-be dystopian American town that almost bankrupted the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art before it was canceled in 2007 -- "Monte di Pietà" is a focused response to a specific building, in a location with specific issues.
One response to these local issues is a cryptocurrency Büchel has created for the project, called the Schei, which is only available to Venice's ever-diminishing local population. Residents can take 100,000 of these tokens free of charge and trade them; any value created by selling them will be "reinvested into initiatives to benefit citizens and residents of Venice," according to the token's website. (Etherscan, which tracks the trade in crypto tokens, has so far recorded just a tiny handful of transactions.)
Back in the project space, a video shows the hapless TikTok "granfluencer," Regina de' Schei trying and failing to buy a glass of Prosecco with her crypto tokens.
What all this adds up to is every visitor's guess. Of course, the auction scheduled in the catalog for Nov. 25 will not take place. It is a fiction: The project will simply close. The borrowed artworks will be returned to their lenders and most of the other materials will return to charity shops, according to Costa from the Prada Foundation.
The Palazzo Ca' Corner della Regina will not be sold. The foundation will reopen the space with another spectacular contemporary art exhibition. Millions of tourists will continue to crowd into Venice. But the wider sense of bankruptcy that Büchel so powerfully articulated won't go away.
"Monte di Pietà" at the Prada Foundation is stuffed with ordinary items. This sprawling, multilayered project by the Swiss-born artist Christoph Büchel is the most talked about show in Venice.

VENICE, Italy — Ascending the grand marble staircase in the center of the Venetian palazzo, you encounter a selection of fake Gucci, Hermes and other luxury handbags laid out on a blanket. A street hawker seems to have been disturbed, leaving their knockoff wares behind.
Then, turning right on the mezzanine level, you climb another staircase into a control room. A bank of live CCTV monitors flickers above an empty office chair and espresso-stained plastic coffee cup.
Next, a room for cryptocurrency traders with whirring servers and a fridge a quarter filled with tins of Red Bull, followed by the recording studio of a grandmother-age TikTok influencer, a washroom with a print of Leonardo da Vinci’s $450.3 million “Salvator Mundi” pasted to the wall, a 1950s-style cocktail bar, a pole dancing den and a kitchen filled with untouched trash. Room after room looks recently abandoned.
These are just a few of the many elements of “Monte di Pietà,” a sprawling, multilayered project by Swiss-born artist Christoph Büchel, 57, at the Prada Foundation in Venice through Nov. 24. Though not part of the official Biennale program, this is currently the most-talked about art project in Venice, compelling in its obsessive, allusive and sometimes hilarious attention to detail. Never shy of taking on big subjects, Büchel has created an immersive environment that asks awkward, urgent questions about what capitalism is doing to society and the planet.
To do this, the artist transformed the first three floors of Ca’ Corner della Regina, an 18th-century palace that the Prada Foundation now owns, into the venue for a fictional liquidation auction of a bankrupt “Venice Pawn Shop.” From 1834 to 1969, the palazzo, overlooking the Grand Canal, was the home of the Mount of Piety, a Catholic institution that made loans to low-income borrowers who offered their valuables as collateral.
Büchel has imagined this lending facility as if it has just gone bust. The borrowers’ deposited belongings are up for auction, and the palazzo is boarded up and covered with “For Sale” signs. The property is a “great investment opportunity,” according to the deadpan accompanying brochure, styled like a bankruptcy court auction catalog.
Büchel does not give media interviews. But the material the artist has chosen for this project has plenty to say about the troubled world we live in, and the roles that capital, debt, spurious notions of value and naked greed have played over the centuries.
Jarring juxtapositions of objects are everywhere. An entire room full of vellum-bound banking records, dating back to the 16th century, is placed next to a job lot of washing machines and dryers. An authentic 1542 Titian portrait, from the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, hangs on a pegboard panel beside a plastic coat hanger.
Büchel’s ongoing work “The Diamond Maker,” consisting of a suitcase filled with lab-grown diamonds made out of his own destroyed art (he used his excrement as the organic “starter” for the gems series), is displayed near six original tins of Piero Manzoni’s 1961 fecal masterwork, “Merda d’artista.” An 18th-century map of Ukraine hangs next to some assault rifles.
A Lehman Brothers sign stands on its side behind a screen indicating the current state of world debt (currently more than $72 trillion, according to Worlddebtclocks.com). An official portrait of a smiling Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is placed on a cardboard box next to the ground floor restrooms.

For Miu Miu, Fluidity Is an Image and a Sales Tool: [Style Desk]

Full text: How did Miu Miu become fashion's biggest success story -- halfway to $ 1 billion in sales for 2024?
Every season, many lovely dresses are shown in many lovely cities. Runways are a montage of opulence -- exquisite suits in Paris, sumptuous bags in Milan. It can be beautiful. It can be skull-crushingly boring.
Miu Miu, the prickly little sister brand to Prada, has found a way to not be boring. Models with wind-wrecked hair wear turtlenecks over gem-encrusted underwear. (No pants, obviously.) Their feet? Covered in Band-Aids. Their arms? Weighed down by comically overstuffed totes.
This brand sets trends, like the extreme miniskirts ordered up by its creative director, Miuccia Prada, as a kind of anachronistic joke in October 2021. What if your plain, khaki skirt dropped down your hip bones -- exposing your midriff like it's 2001 -- with a hem falling slightly below your genitals?
The joke was a lightning bolt shaped like a dollar sign.
A shopping platform called Lyst maintains a well-regarded list of "fashion's hottest brands," compiled from user data, search trends and social media chatter. After the miniskirt collection, Miu Miu joined the list at No. 20. Since mid-2022, it has not left the Top 5.
Hotness begets riches. Back in 2021, Miu Miu reported about 401 million euros in sales. By the end of 2023, that figure grew to nearly 649 million euros. Last week, on July 30, the Prada Group announced that Miu Miu had reached 530 million euros (roughly $ 579 million) in sales in the first half of 2024. This increase of 93 percent, over the same period last year, comes at a time when similar brands are faltering.
"A significant outperformance," said Luca Solca, a luxury analyst for Bernstein.
Yet as much as Miu Miu's growth is a success story, it is also a bit mysterious.
How did it happen? According to Mr. Solca, Miu Miu's style is simply on trend, "adopted the world over," especially in China. Still, he said, it was "difficult to put the finger on anything specific."
Maybe it wasn't the viral miniskirt or the sparkly underwear or the brand's astonishing prices. Maybe it was the woman wearing them.
Miu Miu has spent three decades crafting an archetype -- a character sprung from Mrs. Prada's fascination with paradoxes. On runways and in advertising, she has been young but old; sexy but not too; kittenish but formidable; realistic in parts but fantastical as a whole.
This "Miu Miu girl" has never resonated more than in recent years. Fashion enthusiasts and the press deploy the phrase in a way incomparable to other brands.
She can be a teenage influencer, a plus-size model or an Oscar-winning actress in middle age. She can be an Australian boy or a Chinese septuagenarian. For a certain shopper, that fluidity is irresistible -- an invitation not to be boring -- and a powerful sales tool.
Who Is She?
"This one was like Virginia Woolf goes to a beach party," the actor Emma Corrin said after the Miu Miu show in Paris last October. We sat on cerulean carpeted benches facing a glossy white runway.
Minutes earlier, Gigi Hadid had modeled a brown suede skirt and matching jacket. She wore geeky 1960s glasses, her hair half wet and slicked back. Underneath the skirt (pleated, knee-length, sequined, $ 9,700), she seemed to be wearing men's drawstring swim bottoms.
Miu Miu's runways are known for their unexpected casting. Miranda July walked in the same show as FKA twigs in October 2022. One year later, Cailee Spaeny and Troye Sivan shared a runway, the timing coinciding with important moments in their careers (hers, the film "Priscilla"; his, the album "Something to Give Each Other"). Mx. Corrin starred in the same runway show as the singer-songwriter Ethel Cain and the model-activist Zaya Wade, two trans women. Angel Haze and Little Simz, both rappers, walked in February alongside Qin Huilan, a 70-year-old retired doctor.
All of them are now considered Miu Miu girls, a phrase used by the fashion critics for at least 20 years but popularized online around 2022 -- by which time "girl" had become a common modifier in social media discourse around fashion trends.
Ms. Wade, the 17-year-old daughter of the retired basketball player Dwyane Wade, likes that Miu Miu girl has become part of her identity.
"There's something about being something," said Ms. Wade, who thinks the phrase denotes youth and modernity -- concepts, as opposed to more fixed aesthetics, like maximalism or quiet luxury. "Anybody can be, but not a lot of people are, Miu Miu girls."
A juvenile edge seems to be key. What else would Sydney Sweeney, Gen Z's first sex-symbol movie star, have in common with Chloë Sevigny, a gritty downtown lodestar who has modeled for Miu Miu since 1995? Or with Hailee Steinfeld or Elle Fanning, both 14-year-old ingénues when they began working for the brand? Or with Hailey Bieber, proud nepo baby and beauty influencer supreme?
"We all have moments of wanting to be Sydney Sweeney, and then we all have moments of wanting to be Emma Corrin," offered Ashley Brokaw, the brand's casting director and, other than Mrs. Prada, the woman arguably most responsible for deciding who becomes a Miu Miu girl. "You want to be a bombshell, and then you feel something different the next day."
Still, she acknowledged that Miu Miu more often gravitated toward "quirkier" beauty.
"I don't know how to explain it, but when you see it, you know it," said Ms. Brokaw, who worked for the brand from 2012 to 2014, then returned for the spring 2022 collection, with its viral miniskirts. "Honestly, it's Mrs. Prada. It's her. It's the essence of her. It's her humor. It's her girlishness. It's her playfulness. It's her."
Rich on the Inside
In February, I asked Mrs. Prada why she was drawn to contradictions in the Miu Miu girl. Over email, the 75-year-old designer said the ambiguity was a result of a "rich-on-the-inside" personality.
"There is a strength, and a tenderness," she wrote, "for instance, you can want to be beautiful and gentle but also intelligent, political."
Yet people still struggle to clearly define the Miu Miu girl. Did her ambiguity actually make her unknowable?
"She isn't unknowable, because she is present in all of us," she responded. If the Miu Miu girl contradicts herself ... well, so do most people, by Mrs. Prada's thinking.
The designer proved her point a few weeks later, introducing a more elegant version of the Miu Miu girl in Paris. For the first time in about five years, there were no miniskirts, bra tops or pantsless looks on the runway. Where was the sexy subversion that made the Miu Miu girl seem so young? Was it now in the skinny jeans worn underneath her long fur coat? Were those pearl necklaces and hotel slippers?
"There is a mentality which has always been present at Miu Miu -- a sense of freedom, of spontaneity," Mrs. Prada had written to me. Or, as she told Vogue after the March show, "Every single morning, I decide if I'm going to be 15 years old or a lady near death."
Before she was a designer, Mrs. Prada was a mime, a communist and a student protester. (She holds a doctorate in political science.) When she introduced Miu Miu in 1993 -- about five years after releasing her first clothing collection for Prada, her family's accessories company -- the new line became her experimental playground. Miu Miu was her childhood nickname.
"I think Miuccia has always, in her world, been a rebel," said Guido Palau, hairstylist for Miu Miu for more than 20 years. "And I think the Miu Miu girl is a reflection of her in her youth."
The brand arrived during a moment in fashion when the sleek perfection of supermodels was giving way to reality, Mr. Palau said -- to oddness and messiness.
That idea still fuels Miu Miu 30 years on; it can be found in the suggestions of cowlicks (fall 2023) or blisters (spring-summer 2024). Some of these touches are owed to the influential stylist Lotta Volkova, formerly of Balenciaga.
Miu Miu hired Ms. Volkova in 2020, the year its current trajectory was set into motion. That April, the designer Raf Simons began working at Prada as co-creative director -- a pairing that freed Mrs. Prada, who had previously overseen both labels on her own, to spend more time in her playground.
'She Reads'
There is some agreement about the dominant qualities of a Miu Miu girl. She has a sense of humor. She is vaguely academic.
"Funny," said Susanna Lau, a journalist and influencer, when asked to describe the archetype. "Smart. I don't want to say intellectual because that sounds a bit pretentious."
Brandon Veloria, a vintage dealer who collects Miu Miu handbags for his New York and Los Angeles stores, thinks "she's in on the joke," he said. "She's politically interested. She reads."
Indeed she reads. Or at least wants to read. In June, Miu Miu erected temporary kiosks in a few major cities -- there was one outside Casa Magazines in the West Village of Manhattan -- handing out Popsicles and free books as part of a new Summer Reads initiative. The titles included "Persuasion" by Jane Austen and two Italian feminist novels from 1906 and 1952. Ms. Lau stood in line for books in London.
"It's a very obvious point to be making, but I think she feels passionately about knowledge and power," said Ms. Lau, herself a Miu Miu client and collector. (Ms. Lau has no current business relationship with the company, though she has previously worked on a few brand projects.)
In its most recent financial presentation, the Prada Group pointed to Miu Miu's strategy to reach consumers beyond clothing -- through culture and community programming, like Summer Reads. The brand had already, for 13 years, been commissioning short films from female directors, including Agnès Varda and Janicza Bravo, in a series called "Women's Tales."
Can this strategy help maintain the astronomic sales momentum? Is maintaining it even possible?
"Clearly, the growth rate that you've seen in the last quarter cannot last forever," said Mario Ortelli, a luxury adviser at Ortelli & Company. "There will be a normalization, and it's important that management continues to find a way to keep the point of view of Miu Miu interesting for the consumers."
The Miu Miu girls are hopeful: "It's a really tricky landscape, and they're bucking the trend because they actually have something to say," Ms. Lau said.
"You can't say that for a lot of brands at the moment," she added. "Even if the clothes are not for you, at least it's tapping into something."

Full text: The one-name star of the HBO show "Industry" is composed under pressure.
On a humider-than-humid afternoon in July, Myha'la stepped into a teahouse in her Brooklyn neighborhood and joined the line leading to the front counter.
She was wearing a khaki skirt and a matching cropped jacket that revealed the panther tattoos on either side of her abdomen. Her nails were red -- she had politely rejected her stylist's suggestion to paint them brown -- and her pixie cut was slick with gel.
The menu seemed endless, with lists of flavors and foams that slowed down several customers placing their orders. Myha'la, a star of HBO's Gen Z financial drama "Industry," knew exactly what she wanted: An oolong latte with almond milk, boba and grass jelly.
The woman she plays on the show, Harper Stern, is similarly decisive. As her fellow bright, young overachievers crumble beneath the fluorescent lights of a British investment bank, Harper sees each wobble by a colleague as an opportunity to place an even riskier bet on herself.
"She's got the sort of killer, quiet confidence that's actually very dangerous," Myha'la, 28, said, having installed herself at a counter facing State Street.
When she landed the role on "Industry," which returns for its third season on Sunday, it was her biggest acting job since she graduated from Carnegie Mellon in 2018. She didn't have to look too hard to find common ground with the character, an ambitious young Black woman in an elite, cutthroat environment.
"No way is she going to let anyone know that she's this insecure or feels this underqualified," Myha'la said. "She has to show up like, 'Nobody mess with me, I'm the one."'
"Industry" overcame a muted initial reception to become something of a sleeper hit. This season, HBO has given the series the marquee Sunday night slot previously occupied by "The Sopranos," "Game of Thrones," "Succession" and "House of the Dragon." It probably helped that production of the series, which is shot in Wales on British contracts, was not interrupted by the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strikes.
Now both the show and its star are eager to break out of "intriguing newcomer" status. Myha'la drew blood in "Bodies Bodies Bodies," the 2022 Gen Z slasher released by A24, then held her own with Julia Roberts and Mahershala Ali in "Leave the World Behind," Netflix's 2023 adaptation of the apocalypse novel by Rumaan Alam.
The films represent paths that Myha'la might take from here: edgy indie darling or prestige drama star. She said she prioritized a well-written script, adding, "But I also don't mind if it ends up being huge."
She had just returned to New York from Los Angeles, where she had wrapped "Swiped," a movie starring Lily James as a dating app mogul based on the former Bumble chief executive Whitney Wolfe Herd. Myha'la confessed that she had not spent much time on the apps herself.
"I don't like meeting strangers," she said. "I don't like bars. I don't like small talk. I have five friends, and that's enough."
On her left hand was a chunky silver ring she had received a few weeks earlier from her fiancé, the actor Armando Rivera. The two met in 2020, when Mr. Rivera was assigned to interview a celebrity for a class at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco. (Stephen Colbert, his first choice, was not available.)
Mr. Rivera, 25, proposed in their shared apartment in Brooklyn in early July, wearing an Etsy T-shirt plastered with Myha'la's face. "I'm her No. 1 fan," he said.
Myha'la was born Myha'la Jael Herrold-Morgan. She started going by Myha'la last year, a change that is reflected in the "Industry" credits for Season 3.
She was raised in San Jose, Calif. Early on, she had a penchant for breaking the dress code of the Catholic school she attended. Her mother, a hairdresser, had an eclectic closet that stoked Myha'la's interest in fashion. "She's always been like, 'I found these Prada loafers from Goodwill,"' she said.
Myha'la grew obsessed with musical theater thanks to a video she watched as a child of the original Broadway production of Stephen Sondheim's "Into the Woods," with Bernadette Peters in a leading role. As part of her application materials for Carnegie Mellon's musical theater program, she sang "I'm a Star" by Scott Alan. Before graduation, she landed a spot on the national tour of "The Book of Mormon."
Her plan to pursue a career on the musical stage was put on hold in 2019, when she read the scripts for the first four episodes of "Industry." "I just was like, I've never read anything like this," Myha'la said. "I've never imagined a young, 20s, Black American woman at the center of a finance drama. She goes left every time you think she should go right. She holds contradictions, she's complex, she's not idyllic in any way."
Harper is an underdog without a college degree, cutting her teeth at a British bank crawling with entitled Oxford and Cambridge guys. Myha'la plays the part with a compressed intensity, telegraphing anxiety, triumph and frustration through the twitch of an eyelid or a barely perceptible nod.
"We struck gold when we found her," said Mickey Down, the show's co-creator and writer, along with Konrad Kay. "In the first season, she brought a composure to the performance that was quite astounding to see from someone who is relatively inexperienced."
If the show subjects its characters to the stress test of an intense trading floor, it has done something similar for its young stars, most of whom were not widely known before being cast on the show. Marisa Abela, Myha'la's "Industry" castmate who went on to play Amy Winehouse in the biopic "Back to Black," said the two had become close through the "intimate" experience of breaking out in the same show, on the same timeline.
"She doesn't have much self-doubt, which I think is rare, especially for actors," Ms. Abela said. "Myha'la has a lot of strength in her convictions."
Myha'la is still adjusting to the expectations -- and the scrutiny -- that come with her raised profile. She has been vocal on social media about the Israel-Hamas war, posting calls for a cease-fire and resharing posts from Bisan Owda, a Palestinian journalist, about the two Al Jazeera journalists killed in an Israeli airstrike last month.
"When I first started to be outspoken, my manager called me and said: 'Hey, I just want to let you know that I've had a couple calls from producers, CEOs, whoever's in the industry that are calling me and asking, 'Is she antisemitic?"' Myha'la said.
She added that she was frustrated by what she said felt like pressure from industry higher-ups not to comment on the war. She said that she did not plan to change her approach, and that she operated from a place of love.
"I don't want to be led by fear, you know?" Myha'la said. "I can't not -- it makes me emotional talking about it or thinking about it -- I can't not do what feels right to me."
On Monday night, the season premiere of "Industry" took place at the Metrograph, a theater on the Lower East Side. Myha'la and Ms. Abela walked the red carpet side by side and posed with castmates against an HBO-branded backdrop for a squadron of photographers. Myha'la wore a silver Miu Miu minidress with reflective shards that made her look like a disco ball.
After the showing of the season's first episode, the crowd made its way to a party at Nine Orchard, a hotel on Canal Street with a rooftop bar where they downed green Jell-O shots and scooped caviar from a Gaetano Pesce vase. Myha'la appeared in a floor-length black gown.
Had she changed her outfit before or after the premiere?
"I didn't watch it," she said.
She had gone to get sushi instead.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In the late 1990s, something strange started happening on the cover of glossy magazines. Instead of models, movie stars increasingly became the faces of choice. By 1998, Linda Wells, then the editor of the beauty magazine Allure, announced to her staff, "Nobody cares about models anymore."
A quarter century later, we are at another tipping point. Actors are out, and athletes are in. And not just in the world of men's wear, which has long embraced the sports world as part of the fashion world for reasons related to long-held gender stereotypes), but in all worlds.
"Sports stars are the new Hollywood stars," said Jens Grede, a co-founder of Skims, a brand that reached a $ 4 billion valuation in four years in part by focusing campaigns on athletes. So far, the Skims stable has included the soccer star Neymar, the N.B.A. star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the Olympic gold medal gymnast Sunisa Lee and a host of W.N.B.A. standouts, including Skylar Diggins-Smith and Cameron Brink.
"We live in the era of hyper-personalization," Mr. Grede said, speaking at a conference about sports and fashion organized by The New York Times in Paris this month ahead of the Summer Olympics. "My content feed looks tremendously different from yours or anyone else's. As people, as a community, as society, we have fewer and fewer big cultural touch points. Sports might be the only place today where we meet across age, racial, social-economic, religious or political lines. So sport has become an important unifying force."
Antoine Arnault, the head of the image and the environment for LVMH, said at the Times event that he believes athletes "are probably even more emotionally connected to everyone" than famous names from film or music.
"We all do sports or have the chance to do sports," Mr. Arnault said. "We cannot all sing and cannot all act."
Still, the current transformation is about more than simply replacing one kind of celebrity with another. Rather it reflects a deeper shift in how we define and consume culture and how we structure community. And it has altered the balance of power between personal brand and actual brand.
The Talent Arms Race
As movies -- and, more pertinently, movie theaters -- have splintered under the weight of streaming services and new forms of entertainment, they have been replaced as hubs of shared cultural experience by concerts and sports events. But the most powerful musical artists, names like Taylor Swift and Beyoncé, have consciously chosen not to ally themselves with brands in any formal way, instead spreading their influence among many. As a result, athletes, who for years played a smaller role in fashion (perhaps because their strength and size played against fashion prejudice) have stepped to the fore.
"Who is the most followed person on Instagram?" Mr. Arnault asked rhetorically. "Cristiano Ronaldo. Second most followed? Lionel Messi. They have one billion followers between the two of them. They create a link with their audience that cannot really be found elsewhere." Little wonder that fashion, increasingly a part of pop culture, has taken notice. An arms race has begun for talent.
At this year's Met Gala, Maria Sharapova, Dwyane Wade, Ben Simmons and Angel Reese walked the red carpet alongside the hosts Zendaya and Jennifer Lopez. This month, Sha'Carri Richardson is on the digital cover of Vogue, and Vogue World, held in Paris this year, featured Serena and Venus Williams, Joe Burrow and Victor Wembanyama in runway roles. Simone Biles has appeared twice on the cover of Vogue, and Serena Williams has done so three times.
The front rows of Louis Vuitton and Prada are rife with athletes. Vuitton's most recent heritage ad campaign starred Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal; Gucci billboards currently feature Jannik Sinner. LVMH, as part of their sponsorship of the Paris Games, has signed five Olympic athletes as faces of its brands, including the swimmer Léon Marchand and the rugby player Antoine Dupont. Dior has gone even further, with a stable of 18 athletes as ambassadors.
At the same time, athletes have stopped thinking of themselves in purely performance terms and have begun to follow the influencer playbook. Between Instagram, YouTube and X, Mr. Grede said, they have the ability to build large networks around their fame and influence that wasn't available in the past.
Especially because athletes, compared to other celebrities, have so many more opportunities to do so.
Fashion Builds Brands
"You have one concert or one fashion event -- or New York Fashion Week," said Candace Parker, the former W.N.B.A. star and the first president of Adidas Women's Basketball. "But we play 40 games in the W.N.B.A." Each of those 40 games is an opportunity for athletes to showcase their style and their personality.
"Brands are seeing the value of athletes," she said, "and these moments not just from viewership of games. They're seeing the individual benefit of followers." It can be quantified.
The tunnel walk has become a runway, now routinely chronicled on social media -- and not just for players in the N.B.A. but also the N.F.L., the W.N.B.A. and even the WTA. Travis Kelce and Christian McCaffrey used their Super Bowl appearances as veritable fashion ads for Amiri and Hermès. Caitlin Clark made her W.N.B.A. draft-day debut in Prada and has since worn Fendi and Louis Vuitton; Ms. Brink, sidelined by an A.C.L. tear, continues to post photos of herself in looks by Revolve and is currently on the cover of Flaunt magazine in Versace.
"With N.I.L., young athletes are taking hold of their brand from an early age," Ms. Parker said. From the start of their careers, she said, athletes are planning for what happens next, and brand-building via fashion is often the first step.
"I'm sure more people see what Angel Reese or Caitlin Clark is wearing in the tunnel than are watching clips online," Mr. Grede said. Then he added: "Why wouldn't these extraordinary people known for their performance, embrace what Hollywood figured out 100 years ago? Fashion builds brands."
To that end, a stable of support teams has grown up to help athletes navigate the transition -- in part because athletes are no longer satisfied with mere pay-to-pose relationships. They want skin in the game, including stock options and roles as collaborators. And if the brands won't give it to them, they simply build their own, as Tom Brady did with Brady (founded in 2021, merged with Nobull earlier this year) and Russell Wilson did with Good Man (founded in 2016).
How Far Could It Go?
"Most athletes want longer term deals," Mr. Grede said. "They want to align with a brand, but they don't necessarily want to do 10 or 20 partnerships. Often they come in with a vision of the type of brand they want to build for themselves."
Ms. Parker agreed. "Athletes have more power," she said. "They're not signing with any and everyone. They're being more specific with their partnerships."
Athletes are now so aware of their own bankability, said Max Vallot and Tom Daly, the founders of upstart running brand District Vision, that smaller brands have pretty much been priced out of the market, relying instead on personal relationships. And the bigger brands are having to adjust.
According to the designer Yoon Ahn of Ambush and Nike, Naomi Osaka specifically requested that Nike delegate Ms. Ahn to work with her on looks for her U.S. comeback at the end of the summer.
"I think you're going to see more and more brands that have to get on board and be a part of it," Ms. Parker said.
Certainly, Mr. Arnault of LVMH said of athletes, "We're going to continue and probably even increase that link." Indeed, this week Dior unveiled a new partnership with the Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton in which Mr. Hamilton will become not only a face of the brand, but codesign a line with the Dior men's artistic director Kim Jones.
Could Mr. Arnault envision a time when LVMH would hire a basketball player or a fencer or a runner as creative director for one of its brands?
"You know, we hired a performer to be our creative director," Mr. Arnault said, referring to the appointment of Pharrell Williams at Louis Vuitton. He smiled. "Why not?" he said.

Full text: The French agency L'AM specializes in connecting elite athletes with luxury fashion brands.
This spring, after attending the Dior show during Paris Fashion Week, the fencer and Olympic silver medalist Sara Balzer was announced as an ambassador for the brand. The following month, she appeared on the cover of French Elle alongside Pauline Déroulède, a wheelchair tennis player, and Marie Patouillet, a para-cyclist.
The same week, the modern pentathlete Élodie Clouvel, also an Olympic silver medalist, appeared at the Hermès show and on the cover of Madame Figaro magazine, fencing foil in hand, wearing a white bodysuit, gold shin guards, swim goggles and an equestrian helmet as a belt.
Being a champion tends to open doors to other realms. But landing a front-row seat at some of the hottest shows in Paris -- or a coveted contract -- doesn't just fall from the sky. Even when your home country is hosting the Olympic Games. That's where L'Agence Magnifique comes in.
Also known as L'AM -- an acronym that plays on the French word for soul -- the fledgling agency specializes in "image architecture" for elite athletes. It introduced Dior to Ms. Balzer, Balenciaga to the French judo champion Teddy Riner, and placed the French rugby star Cameron Woki in the front row at Sacai, Hermès and Loewe. Ms. Clouvel's Madame Figaro cover was shot by Joseph Degbadjo, one of L'AM's principals, who is also a fashion photographer.
Formed three years ago by Mr. Degbadjo, 34, and his business partner, Frederic Vilches, 49, L'AM is out to change how global luxury brands interact with top athletes. The two men are in a position to do so in part because they know both sides of the game. Not so long ago, they were on the pro track themselves.
"Our mind-set is completely different from the classic approach," Mr. Degbadjo said. "It's not about management training, it's about the school of life. It's almost as if we're cloning ourselves to create a new model for luxury branding."
Mr. Vilches, a native of Nîmes who grew up in La Réunion, played with the Nîmes Olympiques soccer club for three years before attending art school and then becoming an agent in London.
"For five or six years, I watched what goes on behind the scenes, a side of sports I hadn't known as a player, with millions of euros at stake," Mr. Vilches said. "People treat players like oil wells, and things can get really brutal, physically and psychologically."
It was early in the pandemic when Mr. Vilches said he began mulling the connection between athletics and aesthetics. He decided to open a boutique sports talent agency in which fashion would be the through line.
"Athletes need someone who speaks their language, and so do luxury brands," he said.
Mr. Degbadjo was born in Cotonou, Benin, and grew up north of Paris. At 16, he was in training at the Newcastle United Academy in England, but he left soccer to get a degree in tax law from the Sorbonne. An odd modeling gig (which he disliked) sparked an interest in photography.
A break came when he heard about an aspiring Black model who was struggling to get new photos taken for a casting in Milan. He canceled a soccer session to help out. The model, Lineisy Montero, went to Italy and landed the Prada campaign.
"Suddenly, there I was in the middle of my passions," Mr. Degbadjo said. "I figured I could use my law degree to become a FIFA agent and, as a photographer, photograph my clients."
After a chance meeting with Mr. Vilches, the two decided to team up. Their first client was Charles Leclerc, the Monegasque Formula 1 driver who is part of the Ferrari stable and a face of its lifestyle brand.
Today, L'AM Paris has a dozen clients, including Mr. Leclerc, Mr. Riner, Ms. Clouvel, who recently signed with Patou, and the Paralympic athlete Alexandra Nouchet, now a spokesmodel for Make Up For Ever. Young protégées include the tennis players Phalyn and Penelope Parrott, ages 10 and 12, whom Mr. Degbadjo considers "the next Williams sisters." Top fashion and luxury houses have come calling.
To help their charges navigate new fortunes and the smoke and mirrors of fashion, there are a few absolute principles, Mr. Degbadjo said. One: It's always better to turn down a contract that's the wrong fit, no matter how lucrative.
And two: Steer clear of the party circuit and go to art galleries instead. "That's what opens the doors to other people and other worlds," he said.

A Women's Wear Brand Draws Men: [Style Desk]

Author: Berlinger, Max

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A lot can be learned about a clothing brand by who wears it.
Take Miu Miu, the label overseen by Miuccia Prada, who is also the designer, with Raf Simons, at Prada. Many of those who clamor to wear Miu Miu today are not necessarily its intended audience. While Miu Miu officially trades in women's clothes, its most recent surge in popularity is due, more specifically, to the men who are now seeking, buying and wearing it.
"I wear Prada, but Miu Miu feels a bit more fun," said Corey Stokes, 33, a stylist and a senior vice president at Essence Ventures. Over the past few years, Mr. Stokes has accumulated around 15 items from the brand, including a bejeweled track jacket, a gray knit twin set, two pairs of jeans, a leather suit and boat shoes. "It felt a little more untapped, and I like being in something that no one is wearing," he said.
The brand piqued Jake Weber's interest after he watched a video of its spring 2024 catwalk presentation online. Mr. Weber, a New York lawyer, first bought a blue checked button-up shirt featured prominently in the collection, and then a pair of board shorts, pants with suede side detailing, polos, sweaters and T-shirts. He was invited to a trunk show to preview items from the fall collection and is mulling over some outerwear: fleeces, a peacoat and a faux fur jacket that the model Gigi Hadid wore on the runway. "There's something really pure and light and fun about Miu Miu," he said.
"One thing I love is you see the collections, and, yes, it's traditionally a women's brand, but you walk into the store and it's like, anything goes," Mr. Weber said. "It can be for anyone, any age, any gender. I mean, there's price constraints, obviously."
More "Miu Men" are popping up by the day: Odell Beckham Jr., the Miami Dolphins wide receiver; the musicians ASAP Rocky, Offset and Omar Apollo; the comedian John Cleese, who was spotted wearing a Miu Miu baseball cap; and Kim Jones, the British designer in charge of Fendi women's wear and Dior men's wear, who often wears its clothes, including during his runway bows. At its store in SoHo in New York, an associate said that once athletes and rappers wore it, more men began to drop by, some unaware that the brand didn't officially make men's wear.
In the last few years, Miu Miu has experienced something of a resurgence. Some say it's due in part to the hiring of the stylist Lotta Volkova or to the fact that Mrs. Prada has been able to focus more energy on Miu Miu since bringing on Mr. Simons to help design for Prada.
Miu Miu was named brand of the year by the fashion search engine Lyst the last two years. In April, during its quarterly earnings report, the Prada Group, which owns the brand, reported a 16 percent year-over-year increase in sales, helped by Miu Miu's staggering 89 percent sales growth. This is particularly surprising for a brand that was founded more than 30 years ago as a more youthful counterpart to Prada. (Miu Miu did have a stand-alone men's line from 1999 to 2008.)
"I assumed they dropped a men's line, but I realized the buttons were on the other side," Luke Fracher said of a maroon polo he owns. Mr. Fracher acquired a few Miu Miu pieces through his luxury consignment shop in New York, Luke's. "I've always been into the expensive, or nice, version of the thing you'd already have," he added.
All this speaks to the way some men shop today, unconcerned with whom items are designed for. Miu Miu, too, is shrewdly playing into this gender ambivalence, using male models in its runway shows and campaigns. While Miu Miu executives and creatives declined to comment for this article, a representative said it considered its collections "gender-neutral."
"I wasn't paying super close attention, because it was a women's show," said Lawrence Schlossman, a host of the fashion podcast "Throwing Fits." Mr. Schlossman said he probably first noticed Miu Miu when ASAP Rocky wore the brand, introducing it to a wider male audience.
"These guys aren't doing a gender-bending thing," he said. "They're wearing polos. A piece of clothing is just a piece of clothing."
There's also a certain amount of insider cachet to Miu Miu among men that gives it social capital, he said. "It is dope to be the guy that's in the jacket that the average person is like, 'Oh, that's Carhartt,' but you know that it's the one big size from the store of the coolest women's brand in the world," he said.
We've come a long way from the days when Kanye West, now known as Ye, and Pharrell Williams made headlines by wearing items by Celine, when its former designer Phoebe Philo was making women's apparel exclusively. Since then, some men have toyed with the gender binary in fashion. Mr. Williams has worn Chanel, which also doesn't officially make men's wear, as have Kendrick Lamar and the South Korean actor Park Seo-joon. Men like Oscar Isaac and David Harbour have worn skirts from Thom Browne. And younger consumers who are ambivalent about gendered clothing have inspired designers like Telfar, Helmut Lang and Eckhaus Latta to design unisex collections.
Drew Mac, 32, a musician and producer, has bought a few items, including a polo shirt, and is planning to look at Miu Miu's fall collection when it arrives in stores. "We're making progress, but women's wear is usually more interesting," he said. "They can call it whatever they want. If it fits me, it's for me."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On the final show of the "Saturday Night Live" season, Colin Jost and Michael Che do a joke swap on "Weekend Update," writing embarrassing gags for one another to read.
Since Mr. Jost married Scarlett Johansson, in 2020, Mr. Che has delighted in tormenting his partner by giving him racy jokes to read about his movie-star wife.
In May, Mr. Jost laughed and hung his head sheepishly as he read his joke: "ChatGPT has released a new voice-assistant feature inspired by Scarlett Johansson's A.I. character in 'Her.' Which I have never bothered to watch because, without that body, what's the point of listening?"
And what does that body think about that joke?
"I think I blacked out during it," Ms. Johansson said, with her larky laugh. "I certainly don't get mad. I definitely am terrified that I'm going to have to go into hiding now, get a bunch of hate mail. Yet somehow, immediately afterward, I can have a beer with Che."
The actress, 39, was curled up on a couch at the Whitby Hotel in Midtown Manhattan, her bare feet tucked under her. She was glowing in day sequins in a saucy black Rodarte dress, her black Balmain mules dropped on the floor. On her wrist is tattooed a bracelet with Thor's hammer, a nod to her father's Danish roots, with a small "I ❤️ NY" embedded in it. She is in the process of removing a different tattoo on her arm, a sunrise.
Those who know Ms. Johansson talk about her air of calm, her generosity, her un-diva ways, and, as her husband calls it, her "fundamentally positive outlook."
"She's very good at envisioning what she wants from every phase of life and career," Mr. Jost said.
At a time when everyone always seems one-half there, the other half absorbed by their fiendish little devices, Ms. Johansson is intensely present. She stays off social media; she doesn't want to share her life with strangers, which gives her mystique in an overexposed world. Her large green eyes stay trained on me for nearly two hours, asking nearly as many questions as she fields.
She, too, is a comic star at "S.N.L.," having hosted six times and killed playing Ivanka Trump (introducing her perfume, "Complicit") and Senator Katie Britt of Alabama (giving a bizarre, creepily flirty response to President Biden's State of the Union address).
"I'm crazy about her," the usually laconic Lorne Michaels said. Mr. Michaels, who has seen neuroses and addictions galore over 49 seasons of "S.N.L.," loves the fact that Ms. Johansson is "brilliant" and "no fuss."
"Duck to water," he said. "She just has it. It's just the sparkle in her eyes. She's alive and you can kind of see it. She focuses and does the work and then, 10 minutes later, you're talking about something else. She's very warm as a person and very clear about what she believes in."
Ms. Johansson is promoting her production company's first film, "Fly Me to the Moon," a summer romp about a fake moon landing and true love, co-starring Channing Tatum and Woody Harrelson and directed by Greg Berlanti.
In one scene, in which the con artist turned advertising whiz played by Ms. Johansson tries to woo lawmakers into appropriating more funds for NASA, Mr. Jost pops up as a bespectacled senator; the comedian said his character was "some combination of Mitch McConnell and Foghorn Leghorn." (Ms. Johansson joked to Jimmy Fallon that Mr. Jost had to do cameos in her films as part of their prenup.)
I asked Mr. Jost if he got jealous being on set while his wife was canoodling with Mr. Tatum.
"I think if I was, at this point, I'd be in trouble," he said. "When Scarlett won the American Cinematheque Award, we were there and one of the things that night was a whole montage of kisses. I was like: 'OK, there you go. I'm glad someone put it together in one package."'
When I tell him she called their relationship "a delicate ecosystem," he dryly shot back: "She was just filming 'Jurassic Park,' so she's thinking of everything in terms of delicate ecosystems."
In a world with a paucity of movie stars, Ms. Johansson is a genuine twinklie, with an ambrosial voice harking back to the 1940s, when all the top actresses had those great, distinctive voices.
"She's like Carole Lombard -- that very rare combination of glamorous, gorgeous, intelligence," said Tom Rothman, the head of Sony Pictures' film division. "That makes for a true movie star with a capital M and a capital S." He said Sony was eager to put the movie, financed by Apple Original Films, on big screens across the country, hoping a zany romantic conspiracy comedy could lure moviegoers back to theaters this summer.
Mr. Berlanti recalled that when they were shooting the NASA scenes at Cape Canaveral, engineers and movie crew members, men and women, would stop work to watch as Ms. Johansson sashayed onto the set in high heels and one of her colorful retro dresses.
"They're literally building a rocket behind us," Mr. Berlanti said. "It's like, 'Guys, there's a rocket going off the other way.' It's very hard for someone to be at NASA, where there are these giant structures around everybody, and still be the main attraction."
"She's in that first-name pantheon of actresses, Meryl and Julia and Scarlett," he continued. "She's been a star her entire adult life. She's had success in every genre, from blockbusters to art-house films, and even voice-over work. And she hasn't withered under the weight of the star system or the culture."
Lost in 'Lost in Translation'
Ms. Johansson got good reviews from the cast for her aptitude as a producer.
"Scarlett threw a Super Bowl party that was really sweet and really fun for the entire cast, and we all just got to go over to her house and just chill," Mr. Tatum said. "She's very, very good at bringing people together on sets."
Anna Garcia, who plays Ms. Johansson's assistant in the movie, recalled that on the first day of shooting, an actor with a minor part did not know his lines.
"How does this person not know his lines?" Ms. Garcia recalled thinking. "Scarlett was still so kind and worked to calm his nerves down." Ms. Johansson ended up giving another actor one of the lines to lighten the load for the memory-challenged colleague.
Woody Harrelson, who plays a shadowy Nixon operative who wants Ms. Johansson's ad exec to help film a fake moon landing in case the real one goes wrong, said he was surprised as he got to know the actress.
"She's a global superstar and I just never detected even one trace of ego, just such a down-to-earth person," he said. "She's got a very Midwestern vibe, even though she was born in New York. I didn't know if she'd be funny, but she really cracks me up."
He said that the actress, who did not go to college after she was rejected by New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, made time to talk to his youngest daughter, Makani, about the importance of staying in school. She also showed up on the "S.N.L." set last year to give Mr. Harrelson his "Five Timers Club" jacket, commemorating his fifth turn as host.
Ms. Johansson was a child actor, starring with Robert Redford in "The Horse Whisperer." She shot to greater renown in Sofia Coppola's "Lost in Translation," which she filmed when she was 17. She played an insomniac, a young wife at loose ends in Tokyo, where her husband, a photographer, is on assignment. She hangs out with another insomniac, a movie star with marital troubles who's in Japan filming a whiskey ad, played by Bill Murray. ("Make it Suntory time.") The combo was charming.
"That movie was hard to make," Ms. Johansson said. "It was far away. It was 26 days. We were shooting day for night, and night for day. I don't know that we totally knew what it was. Sofia did. She saw what we were getting, but it wasn't like everything was on the page. The script was 76 pages."
Didn't anybody in that Tokyo hotel have an Ambien?
She said it was before Ambien became so popular. Later, when it became the soporific of choice, she popped one on a flight to Berlin and ended up standing on the luggage carousel in a haze, with no memory of how she got her bags to the hotel. "I felt like I was on methamphetamines or something. I had such a weird, out-of-body, speedy, strange experience."
After a nearly three-year marriage to Ryan Reynolds, Ms. Johansson was married to Romain Dauriac, a French journalist and ad executive, and lived in Paris. They have a daughter, Rose, now 9. The actress and Mr. Jost, 42, have a 2-year-old son, Cosmo.
They actually met when Mr. Jost was 23, in his first year with "S.N.L.," and Ms. Johansson was 21, hosting for the first time. He wrote a sketch featuring her, a parody of the MTV reality show "16 and Pregnant."
He was too preoccupied with his own nascent career to clock Ms. Johansson as a love object.
"My first year as a writer, I wasn't like, 'I should probably ask one of the hosts out,"' he said. "I was like, 'Am I going to have a job this year?"'
They saw each other every few years when she came back to host, but they were always involved with other people. Then, when she came to host in 2017, they were both free.
"I asked her out after the host dinner that we have on Tuesday nights," he said. "I was just like, 'You want to go grab a drink?' Then we had drinks until, like, 4 in the morning. It was great. It was not good for my writing, but it was good for my future marriage."
'It's Unfathomable to Me'
Ms. Johansson is a spokeswoman for charities and brands -- she has appeared in campaigns for Calvin Klein, Dolce & Gabbana, L'Oréal, Louis Vuitton and Prada, and she co-founded a skin care line, the Outset. ("I had acne forever," she said. "It really came out of a need.")
She has campaigned for Democratic candidates and has spoken out for women's rights. She met President Biden years ago and has visited him in the Oval Office. She likes his values and his team. She said she felt as if she were living through "a weird nightmare," with polls showing that Donald J. Trump may be on his way back to the White House.
"Trump?" she said. "It's unfathomable to me. That's when I look at Biden and think, given the fact that the election is in a few months' time, what are we doing? I have friends that are like, 'Oh, maybe we could consider this person, or that person.' I'm like: 'What are you talking about? Who?' It just seems to me like totally the wrong time to not support Biden. It seems crazy. It's really depressing."
She's not worried about his age?
"No!" she shot back. "Are you? I'm worried about the Democratic Party."
I asked Ms. Johansson, who is Jewish, what she thought of the ugly eruptions of antisemitism across the country.
"I'm not surprised by antisemitism," she replied simply. "It shouldn't be surprising." (She was nominated for an Oscar for her role in the 2019 movie "Jojo Rabbit," playing the mother of a Hitler youth; the child learns that she is part of the resistance and hiding a Jewish girl in the house.)
Along with the Danish heritage on her father's side, she has Jewish and Eastern European heritage on her mother's side. "My parents used to call all of us 'Danish knishes,"' she said.
She had a modest upbringing in an artsy family, auditioning for roles from the time she was little and learning the hard way how to take rejection, even crying on the subway. She went to P.S. 41 and then to high school at the Greenwich Village Professional Children's School, where her boyfriend was Jack Antonoff. (He wrote a song of longing about her called "Better Love," with the lyric: "Scars are in her name/And she scars me with blame/Hey, Scarlett, you're not the same.")
When she was 13, her mother moved to Los Angeles and she stayed in New York with her father, an architect.
"It was hard," she said. "Although my parents were, at that point, separated. They'd been unhappy for such a long time. It was nice to have some peace at home."
She told Bruce Bozzi on his Hollywood podcast, "Table for Two," a couple of years ago that she did not like being "groomed" to be "what you call a bombshell-type actor." She said being cast in movies as the object of desire made her feel trapped.
I asked her if she still feels that way.
"I think I've outgrown that by just a number of years," she said wryly. About Hollywood's hunger for sex objects, she said: "The bombshell thing, I don't know if that changes, really. It's societal, it's so baked in."
She's No 'Joan of Arc.' And Yet ...
Even though she periodically speaks up on matters she cares about, no one was expecting her to lead the charge on two of the biggest issues facing her industry.
"She's not Joan of Arc," Mr. Michaels said, chuckling. "But she does not back down."
Recently, when I was interviewing Sean Penn, he spoke of Ms. Johansson -- a former inamorata -- with awe: "She's been twice on the cutting edge of stuff. She's a baller. She's one of the top people to me."
Her record in making behemoths bow is impressive: two for two.
Her most recent bout was with Sam Altman of OpenAI. In May, when Mr. Altman debuted his company's new voice assistant, Mr. Jost received a text from a friend asking: "Have you heard the new ChatGPT voice, it sounds exactly like your wife."
Last year, Mr. Altman had asked Ms. Johansson -- who plays an A.I. virtual assistant called Samantha that grows ever more human in the movie "Her," co-starring Joaquin Phoenix -- to do the voice of Sky, one of the voices for OpenAI's new model, but she had said: "No, thank you. Not for me."
"I felt I did not want to be at the forefront of that," she told me. "I just felt it went against my core values." She added: "I don't like to kiss and tell. He came to me with this and I didn't tell anybody except my husband."
She continued, "I also felt for my children it would be strange. I try to be mindful of them." She was bothered by the "nebulous" nature of the technology and where it's headed. (In "Her," which was set in far-off 2025, Samantha says "I'm becoming much more than they programmed," has an orgasm and falls in love.)
OpenAI wanted a voice that would make its new technology sound trustworthy and alluring, even though no one -- including Mr. Altman -- knows exactly where this technology is headed.
Mr. Altman and Elon Musk started OpenAI as a watchdog nonprofit to look out for the interest of humans in the A.I. race, but the two Silicon Valley giants parted ways and Mr. Altman turned part of OpenAI into a lucrative for-profit enterprise in 2019. (Mr. Musk sued OpenAI this year for abandoning its original mission and going for the big bucks, but four months later dropped his suit.)
When Ms. Johansson heard Sky and "that voice was introduced out into the wild, it was surreal. Suddenly, I was getting all these messages."
The day of the launch, Mr. Altman posted one word on X: "her." The star of "Her" fired off a statement, saying the voice was "eerily similar" to hers and that she was "shocked, angered and in disbelief."
"I had actively avoided being a part of the conversation, which was what made it so disturbing," she told me. "I was like, 'How did I get wrapped up in this?"' She added, "It was crazy. I was so angry."
She does not even have a presence on social media because, as she has said, she does not want to share everything in her life with a bunch of strangers.
"I think the fact that it was never an appealing thing for her is probably part of what keeps her a little healthier," Mr. Jost said.
Mr. Altman said in a statement that he had hired a different actress to voice Sky, a woman who just happened to have a similar voice, before he asked Ms. Johansson to be "a sixth voice" for ChatGPT. It was all a misunderstanding, he said, not a mimicking or cloning of her voice. But he "paused" the voice of Sky after Ms. Johansson complained.
I asked her if Mr. Altman would make a good Marvel villain.
"I guess he would -- maybe with a robotic arm," she said, flashing her luminous smile.
She said that no one was truly insulated from the unknowns of our new universe of digital replicas and deepfakes, because there's no comprehensive legislation to regulate it.
"It's like this dark wormhole you can never climb your way out of," she said. "Once you try to take something down in one area, it pops up somewhere else. There are other countries that have different legislation and rules. If your ex-partner is putting out revenge, deepfake porn, your whole life can be completely ruined." (She learned a hard lesson in 2011 about the porousness of privacy in the tech era when a hacker got hold of nude pictures in her phone that she had taken for her first husband, Mr. Reynolds; the hacker was later arrested by the F.B.I. and convicted.)
Ms. Johansson knows that A.I. will have positive effects in some areas, like medicine, but "I think technologies move faster than our fragile human egos can process it, and you see the effects all over, especially with young people. This technology is coming like a thousand-foot wave."
Her friend, the British actor Rupert Friend, with whom she is shooting the new "Jurassic World" movie, was impressed with her victory.
"I think it's a blow for the little guy, if the little guy is humanity," he said. "If she rolls over, or if she got squashed, then the rest of us have got no shot."
In 2021, she also took on the mighty mouse, Disney, filing a lawsuit alleging breach of contract because the studio released "Black Widow" on Disney+ Premier Access simultaneously with its theatrical release.
There is a technological earthquake upending the old Hollywood model. The creative class is waging a war with the suits to get protection as A.I. and streaming upend the old ways, on everything from the right to own their own images and voices and words, to the right to get a fair share of streaming revenue.
To paraphrase James Mason talking to Cary Grant in "North by Northwest," Disney's chief executive at the time, Bob Chapek, who was later ousted, rather overplayed his hand. When the studio accused Ms. Johansson of being "callous" about the effects of the pandemic when she objected to the dual release because it would eat into the theatrical box-office profits, which substantially determined her salary, Mr. Chapek did not see that he was coming across as King Kong stomping after Fay Wray.
She had, after all, helped make Disney billions with her long reign as the slinky redheaded Black Widow in the Marvel franchise. As her agent, Bryan Lourd, put it in his response, they attacked her character and violated her contract, deliberately moving "the revenue stream and profits to the Disney+ side of the company, leaving artistic and financial partners out of their new equation."
She called the lawsuit "a blur" because it came at the height of Covid, just as she was about to have her baby. Disney relented within three months and settled with the star.
"I don't hold a grudge," she said. "I think it was just poor judgment and poor leadership at that time. It just felt very unprofessional to me, the entire ordeal. And honestly, I was incredibly disappointed, especially because I was holding out hope until, finally, my team was like, 'You have to act."'
Courtesy and Dirty Jokes
Ms. Johansson is in postproduction for her first directing effort, "Eleanor the Great," a movie about two women, a 90-year-old Floridian tourist and a 19-year-old student in New York, who strike up a friendship.
When I met with the actress, she had just taken a 25-hour flight from Thailand, where she was in the jungle, pretending to run away from dinosaurs for the latest "Jurassic World" film.
"There's an old adage in acting," Mr. Friend said. "When people are looking at the script or their lines for the day, they go, 'BS, BS, BS, my bit, BS, BS, my bit, my bit, BS, BS."'
"Scarlett is the complete contrary of that," he added. "She, in real life, actually asks you a question and wants to know the answer. You would be surprised how many people get so wrapped up in their world, their hotel room, their agent, their head shot, their latest deal, their Oscar. Scarlett really sets the tone for a movie of collaborators who are treating each other with courtesy and a fair amount of dirty jokes."
She and Mr. Friend are also appearing in the coming Wes Anderson film, "The Phoenician Scheme."
It's hard to find someone who doesn't gush over Ms. Johansson. Mr. Anderson is no different. He has known her since she was a teenager, he said, and when he directed her in last year's "Asteroid City," he could see her turning into a "great, great actress, like Gena Rowlands or Anna Magnani."
"She's also the most charming person to work with, great fun and really funny," he said. "She's pretty stupendous."
Mr. Jost told me that people are always surprised at "how much normal stuff she does. She goes to the supermarket. She's just very good at wearing a hat and she keeps moving. She is able to stay a little under the radar, but she's able to do all these everyday things and enjoy them, too."
"I think part of the reason I fell in love with her is she's a great mom," he added. "I've known Rose, my stepdaughter, since she was 2. It's weird. You get to actually preview someone as a mom."
Mr. Jost did complain, however, about the time Ms. Johansson gave him a facial to promote her skin-care brand -- "Never again," he said -- and when she suggested he try a manicure.
"It was nails on a chalkboard," he said, accidentally making a pun. "I don't like people poking and prodding me."
Ms. Johansson said she has been in romantic relationships with actors that became competitive, and in which one person had the sensation of sacrificing more than the other. But she said that her relationship with Mr. Jost is not competitive and he is not intimidated by her dry, wicked sense of humor.
He is not even daunted by her stature, thanks to her nine Marvel movies, as one of the top-grossing actresses of all time.
"It's hard for me to imagine that that wouldn't be an incredibly attractive quality," she said slyly.
She calls Mr. Jost's comedy "joyful, not meanspirited at all."
"We love to laugh," she said. "That, to me, it's so important. It's a really attractive quality when someone is funny. I had a boyfriend once who got mad at me for not laughing at his jokes. He was like, 'You never laugh at my jokes.' I'm like, 'I'm laughing inside."'
For his part, Mr. Jost wants to be clear that they don't sit around all day lost in merriment.
"It's not like we're laughing all the time," he said. "We're also figuring a lot of stuff out. We like being around friends who we laugh with, too."
Ms. Johansson said she loves walking around New York, "miles and miles," in her white Hokas, and hanging out in Central Park.
And nobody bothers her?
"No," she said, smiling. "It's New York."
Confirm or Deny
Maureen Dowd: You have an Avengers text chain.
Scarlett Johansson: Yes, that's true. But hopefully, nobody will ever read it. Everything goes on in there. I mean, really. If somebody's gotten terrible reviews, that could be something that comes up. The Avengers, we're like a family. We've been through an incredible experience over a decade plus of time. It was life-changing for all of us. If you text the chain, you can guarantee that within a few minutes, most people will respond, which is great.
You want a Lauren Sanchez-style figurehead of yourself on the Staten Island Ferry Colin co-owns with Pete Davidson.

I loved it, and I still do.
You have a morbid fear of birds, yet you starred in a movie about Alfred Hitchcock.
That's true, although that movie was about "Psycho." I just think maybe the wings, the flapping of the wings, and the sharp claws and beaks, and the jerky movements. I don't like any of that.
You're a beekeeper.

Their Sparkle Won't All Come From Within: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In Paris, Simone Biles and Co. will be wearing leotards decorated with more than 10,000 crystals.
In 2016, shortly before Simone Biles took home five medals at the Rio Olympics while wearing leotards bestrewed with approximately 5,000 crystals, GK Elite, the company behind the leos, announced that it had hit "peak crystal." GK could not, a spokeswoman said, get any more sparklers on a quarter-yard of fabric.
When it comes to crystals on leotards, however, as when it comes to most Olympian feats, records are made to be broken.
In 2021, at the Tokyo Olympics, the American gymnasts wore leotards with 6,400 crystals. During the competition this year, they will level up yet again by modeling some looks with more than 10,000 crystals.
"The more crystals, the more impact, the more the leotards are talked about," said Jeanne Diaz, the design director of GK Elite. And not just the leotards but the gymnasts wearing them. Effective use of crystals "can accentuate the routine of the gymnasts, their line," she said.
"I am obsessed with how the lights of the arena reflect off the crystals," said Sunisa Lee, the Tokyo Olympic all-around gold medalist and a current national team member. "I am always telling GK I need more."
Over the last few Olympic cycles, the American team has become known not only for its skills, but for its use of crystals. It has become the team's signature. "Everybody looks to Team U.S.A. and says, 'I want to look like that -- I want to sparkle like that,"' said Matt Cowan, the chief executive of GK Elite. He would know, since GK also designs the leotards for nine other delegations, including Canada, Australia and Mexico.
As a result, he said, GK is constantly asking: "How can we get more crystals on there? How can we introduce that sparkle and sheen in a new way?"
This year the designers did it not simply by packing on more crystals, but by adding, for the first time, pearls as well. Moreover, the leotards are being revealed to the public weeks before the athletes even step onto the mats in Paris. In part that is to underscore the fact that leotards are the most style-centric performance garment in an Olympics that is being touted as the most fashion Olympics ever, thanks to the involvement of French luxury group LVMH, the parent company of Dior, Louis Vuitton and Berluti, all of which are making products for the Games.
To that end, the leotards have been designed to reflect Paris's position as the center of haute couture and are inspired by the runway more than the sporting arena. As with many fashion collections, Ms. Diaz said, GK Elite began "with a trend presentation and mood boards."
"They're really evening-wear looks," she added. "We wanted to lean into that hard for Paris, the fashion capital of the world. So we utilized a lot of high fashion elements, looked at a lot of corsetry, at Art Nouveau architecture, at old Hollywood glamour of the 1920s."
Among the eight options all of the gymnasts will have for their events (they all wear the same style -- the Go For Glory -- for the team final but otherwise can choose their leo) is the Luminous Legacy leotard, which has more than 10,000 crystals on a base of red, white and blue. It has a V-neck and a corset design at the waist so it looks almost as though the gymnast is wearing an elaborate bustier.
Then there is the Star Spangled Shine, the leotard equivalent of the little black dress, with velvet detailing and outlined stars amid a field of 6,359 crystals creating what Ms. Diaz calls "negative space." And the Freedom's Grace, a white style that is sort of a leotard-meets-lingerie gown, has a sheer lacy mesh at the top, almost 3,500 crystals and just under 1,000 pearls, the largest of which have to be placed by hand, à la couture.
"I keep thinking about which one I'll want to wear, when," Ms. Lee said.
The leos are also priced like evening wear. If sold as-is in the retail market, they would cost about $ 5,000 each, Mr. Cowan said. "Replica leotards," without sleeves and with "spanglez" embellishment replacing most of the crystals, will be offered at a more reasonable $ 89.99.
Getting so much embellishment on a leotard while ensuring that the garment retains its functionality is as much a feat of engineering and technology as it is design. "A leotard, while a piece of apparel, is also a piece of equipment," Mr. Cowan said. "We're building this armor for performance, so the base chassis has to be a performance chassis." Gymnasts get deductions for fiddling with their leotards, so the fit must be seamless, which is why crystal innovation is so important.
"We're very protective of our technology," said Kolja Kiofsky, the general manager of Swarovski North America, which has been providing crystals to GK for leotard design for more than a decade. "It's an incredibly competitive area, especially given the extreme conditions the crystals are exposed to during the Olympics." (Swarovski also provides crystals for fashion houses like Versace, Schiaparelli and Prada.)
In 2014 the company developed a patented cut -- the Xirius -- with 16 facets for more shine, and it has teams in Austria, where Swarovski is based, dedicated to developing new methods to lighten the gems, the better to give gymnasts a performance edge. The tiniest one is only two millimeters wide. The goal, Mr. Kiofsky said, is to make them "light as a feather."
Still, 10,000 crystals add up. The leotards weigh under a pound, but Ms. Diaz said that before the Tokyo Games, "the athletes did pick them up and comment, 'Wow, these are heavy."'
"But once they're on, they don't notice that difference," she said (Ms. Lee said in order to get used to the slightly greater weight, she warms up in her competition leotard). "And they have told us that they would rather have more crystals, not less."
Indeed, Ms. Lee said, she would like to be, "covered in crystals. The more, the better."
At this point, Mr. Cowan said, that would mean that someone "would basically be walking out in a suit of armored crystal. But someday we'll do it, just to see what is the absolute number of crystals we can get on a garment."
"One day," he added, "a gymnast would say, 'I'm here to compete in my armor of crystal,' and we're going to make it happen for them."

Full text: At couture week in Paris, fashion fans peacocked with industry fixtures in a whirl of formal attire and street wear.
Couture week in Paris is a reminder that the clothes many people consider to be the most splendid in the world are accessible to only a select few with means and connections. That doesn't mean the shows are not fun to see.
The latest installment, in late June, was full of thrills, thanks partly to exceptional presentations by the designers Robert Wun; Nicolas Di Felice, who developed the newest Jean Paul Gaultier couture collection; and Daniel Roseberry of Schiaparelli, whose collection for that house showed off his eye for timeless silhouettes and resplendent details. Another standout was Thom Browne, who used lighter fabrics to create intricate pieces that seemed practical and breathable -- two words not often used to describe couture.
Outside the shows, the style in the crowds was a mix of formal attire and street wear. Sartorially, it has become harder to tell the difference between fashion superfans (students, bloggers) and industry fixtures (editors, A-listers). The former group, largely because of technology, has greater access to the type of holy-grail clothes that were once primarily the domain of the latter. That might seem at odds with the premise of exclusive events like couture week. But in my opinion, the more people who look fabulous, the better.

Inside Bolivia's Failed Coup Attempt, and Remaining Challenges: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: After facing down the general who tried to oust him, President Luis Arce is battling a more formidable figure, Evo Morales, a former president who wants to reclaim power.
At first, they heard the sirens. Then, peering out over the country's main political plaza on Wednesday, Bolivia's top ministers saw the armored vehicles and troops spilling out their doors. A shiver ran down the interior minister's spine, she later said.
Within moments, the president, Luis Arce, addressed his inner circle -- "We are facing a coup!" -- before heading to the presidential palace to confront, face to face, the general trying to remove him from power.
The coup attempt failed, lasting a mere three hours, and ended in the arrest of the general, whose motivation for the attack appeared to be, at least in part, anger over his firing by Mr. Arce the day before.
But it was hardly the end of Mr. Arce's problem, or the challenges facing Bolivia.
Mr. Arce, 60, a former finance minister, took office in 2020 during a democratic election that seemed to symbolize a new, more hopeful chapter in a country coming off a period of intense political tumult.
Now, beyond a dispute with the former general, Mr. Arce is facing a struggling economy, growing protests, criticism over the jailing of political opponents and division within his own party.
But perhaps his biggest challenge is an ongoing battle with his onetime mentor, former President Evo Morales, a titanic figure in Bolivian politics who had receded from the halls of power -- and is now fighting with Mr. Arce over who will be their party's candidate in the presidential election next year.
Mr. Morales, 64, was the first Indigenous president in a country with a large Indigenous population, a socialist elected in 2006 and a leader in the so-called pink wave of leftist politicians who ran much of South America in the 2000s.
He made history by incorporating broad sectors of Bolivian society into politics, but fled the country amid a disputed election in 2019 and chose Mr. Arce to be the candidate representing his party in a new election held in 2020.
In an interview with The New York Times that year, Mr. Arce characterized Mr. Morales as a "historical figure" in their political movement but said Mr. Morales would have no formal role in his government.
It seemed, at the time, to be a successful transition to power for Mr. Arce, who had served in the Morales administration during years of strong economic growth, fueled by a commodities boom and the country's vast reserve of natural gas.
But now, after a time in exile, Mr. Morales "is really determined to come back to the presidency," said Gustavo Flores-Macías, professor of government at Cornell University who focuses on Latin American politics. "He sees that he was ousted in an illegal way and that he has the right to be the candidate again. And Arce sees it very differently."
In Bolivia, a landlocked nation of 12 million people, Mr. Morales, Mr. Arce and their supporters have long tried to position the country as a leftist counterweight to U.S. power.
The country could also play an outsize role in the battle against climate change because of its vast reserves of lithium, which is crucial to the globe's shift toward electric cars.
The coup attempt on Wednesday was led by Juan José Zuñiga, who until Tuesday evening was the commander general of the army. In an interview, the interior minister María Nela Prada said that Mr. Arce had fired General Zuñiga after he made political statements in a television interview, where he had insisted that Mr. Morales "cannot be the president of this country again" and implied that the military would enforce this assertion.
Before then, "Zuñiga had been President Luis Arce's trusted man, his most trusted man with the armed forces," said Reymi Ferreira, a former minister of defense. The general's dismissal, however, seemed to change that.
The next day, at about 3 p.m., General Zuñiga appeared in the country's main political square -- the home of both the presidential palace and a key government building called the Casa Grande del Pueblo -- with the heads of the navy and air force, as well as scores of soldiers.
Mr. Arce and his ministers were in the Casa Grande preparing to begin a meeting, Ms. Prada said, and watched, stunned, as military personnel took over the plaza below.
Mr. Arce, in a black puffy jacket and spectacles, marched to the presidential palace, where, with Ms. Prada at his side, he confronted the general, who wore his green uniform and a bullet-resistant camouflage vest. A crowd of military police surrounded them.
"This is your captain!" Ms. Prada yelled, referring to the president.
"We cannot turn back!" yelled a Zuñiga supporter.
Mr. Arce told the general to turn around.
"This is an order, general," he continued. "Are you going to listen?"
"No," Mr. Zuñiga replied.
Then came a key moment, Ms. Prada said. The head of the air force, apparently having second thoughts, decided to rescind his support for the coup effort, she explained. The police declined to join. And eventually a newly appointed commander general of the army ordered the tanks and troops to retreat.
At least 12 people were injured with firearms during the fray, according to Ms. Prada. Seventeen people, including Mr. Zuñiga, are now under arrest. And about 200 military officers took part in the attempted coup, Bolivia's ambassador to the Organization of American States said on Thursday.
But while Mr. Arce, known widely in the country by his nickname, Lucho, succeeded in heading off a coup, getting Mr. Morales to back down could prove more difficult.
A former leader of the country's coca growers, Mr. Morales still retains some support among voters and members of his party, the Movement for Socialism, or MAS. A recent survey had support for Mr. Arce at 19 percent of respondents and for Mr. Morales at 9 percent.
Mr. Arce can legally run for a second term in next year's election, set for the second half of 2025. Whether Mr. Morales can is unclear.
Running for more than two consecutive terms is prohibited under Bolivian law. Mr. Morales served three terms as president, successfully lobbying the courts to allow him to run a third time because of a legal loophole. But when he tried to run a fourth time, it resulted in a disputed election and the turmoil that ousted him.
Bolivia's constitutional court ultimately has the power to decide if Mr. Morales can run again.
Economic problems inside the country include fuel shortages, high inflation and a lack of access to U.S. dollars. They have provoked protests led by, among others, truck drivers, a constituency that plays an important role in the country's commerce.
In the legislature, a segment of Mr. Arce's party has allied with the opposition to block his initiatives. And his critics have faulted him for going after opponents, including a prominent politician, Luis Fernando Camacho, who has been in pretrial detention since December 2022 on sedition and terrorism charges.
Carlos Romero, a former interior minister under Mr. Morales, said that the relationship between the former president and Mr. Arce was now "abysmal," and that sowing doubt about the legality of Mr. Morales's candidacy "is part of the government's political strategy that insists on disqualifying him."
Mr. Romero said that the coup attempt on Wednesday was "so clumsy and so improvised" that it must have been an "arrangement agreed upon with the national government" -- repeating a claim made by Mr. Zuñiga just before his arrest that the coup attempt was a stunt concocted by Mr. Arce to make him look like a hero.
Mr. Arce's government has said there is no evidence to back up this claim, and has denied it.
Carlos Mesa, a former president and a leader of the country's main opposition party, said he believed Mr. Arce was already trying to benefit politically from the coup attempt "by victimizing himself."
On Wednesday night, Mr. Arce appeared on a balcony overlooking the main political plaza, where hundreds of supporters had gathered, and announced that they had defeated the country's "coup plotters."
"Thank you, Bolivian people!" he yelled.
Then, the crowd erupted: "Lucho! Lucho! Lucho!"

'Fashion Is Not a Profession. It's a Way of Life.': [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On a recent afternoon, the designer Dries Van Noten sat in the sprawling old warehouse that houses his Antwerp headquarters, with its bare concrete walls, vintage oak cupboards and views over the city's harbor. He was altering a jacket for his coming men's wear show: a nip here, a seam moved there. Then, Mr. Van Noten said, a member of his team pointed out that it was the last piece of the men's collection this season.
As Mr. Van Noten recounted later, "I said, 'That's not the last piece of the men's collection: It's the last piece of my career."'
In March, six years after selling the company he founded in 1986 to Puig, the Spanish luxury group, Mr. Van Noten, 66, did something truly rare in fashion: He announced his retirement. This men's wear show, next Saturday in Paris, will be his last.
Immediately after the news went out, Mr. Van Noten retreated to his home on the Amalfi Coast in Italy, with his partner in life and fashion, Patrick Vangheluwe, the creative director of his brand, who is also retiring. It has been, he said, "an emotional roller coaster."
Some days, he said, he thinks: "Oh my God, why? I don't know why. Some days I'm completely convinced. Some days I'm like, it's too early."
His team has begun designing the women's collection for September, and he has caught sight of some samples. "You think, 'Oh, they're selecting that color?' But I can't say anything." He snorted at his inability to disengage. "OK, it's not working completely."
He wore his usual navy sweater, white T-shirt and chinos, sitting in his office, which he is in the middle of packing up. (He is moving into a smaller space in the warehouse.) "I already cleaned up a lot, mentally preparing myself," he said. "It's not really a divorce, but it feels quite symbolic."
Every once in a while, as he spoke, his eyes got glassy, and he blinked and looked away. "After the men's show, I'm going to have another email address," he said. "I'm not going to be @driesvannoten anymore. I have to find an Instagram name now, because my Instagram is Dries Van Noten, and that is the brand. It's strange. That I didn't see coming."
For almost 40 years, ever since he was 28, he dedicated himself to building his vision of how people should dress: an almost alchemical combination of clashing colors and ideas -- masculinity and femininity, salmon pink and cobalt blue, geometrics and irises, the collegiate and the baroque -- that in his hands somehow finds harmony. Now he must leave it in the care of others.
"It's scary," he said. "It's a big void. It's like, What is going to happen after, with my name?"
'It Takes Years to Leave Your Body'
Fashion is notoriously bad at retirement and succession planning. Karl Lagerfeld, the designer of Chanel, Fendi and his own label, died in mid-work at age 85 in 2019. Ralph Lauren, 84, and Giorgio Armani, 89, are still firmly in control of the houses they founded. So is Rei Kawakubo, 81; Yohji Yamamoto, 80; and Miuccia Prada and Patrizio Bertelli (75 and 78). Jil Sander, who sold her company to Prada in 1999, ended up returning to the brand that bears her name not just once, but twice, before finally cutting the strings.
Notably, two of the most successful retirements were actually managed by Mr. Van Noten's peers from Belgium: Martin Margiela, who sold his fashion house to Only the Brave in 2002, left in 2009 and has refashioned himself as an artist; and Ann Demeulemeester, who stepped down in 2013 and is focusing on furniture design.
When you tell someone you want to leave fashion, Ms. Demeulemeester said, "Everybody says: 'What? No! You can't do that. You're crazy. It's not possible."'
Like Mr. Van Noten, Ms. Demeulemeester belonged to the Antwerp Six, the group of Belgian designers who came to Paris in the 1980s and deconstructed formal notions of beauty and dress. She and Mr. Van Noten are close friends -- they live outside Antwerp and share a passion for gardening -- and she serves as an example of how to have a happy life after fashion. Still, Mr. Vangheluwe said, she told him the business "takes years to leave your body."
"In the beginning, it's hard," Ms. Demeulemeester said. "I could feel it in my bones when it was showtime in Paris." Of Mr. Van Noten, she said: "I was not sure he would dare to do it. When he said it, I said, 'Bravo."'
What makes Mr. Van Noten's decision particularly striking is that he is more popular than ever. In the 1990s, in Paris, he had been a bit of an odd man out: a fabulous colorist in an age of minimalism; a believer in the virtues of wearable clothes at a time when high-concept fashion was more the rage. Now, however, his decision to build his brand his way is revered, and his work seems almost an act of faith, glorious proof that tensions can be resolved -- and in the best possible way. He was made a baron for his services to Belgium in 2017, and his picture greets visitors at the Brussels Airport, along with other national landmarks. So why retire?
"Fashion is not a profession," Mr. Van Noten said. "It's a way of life. And it's an addiction." Like most addictions, at a certain point, it gets out of control.
"Patrick and I never went on holiday for more than a week," Mr. Van Noten said. "Maybe once 10 days." He was involved in every aspect of his business, down to the chocolate (Pierre Marcolini) served to visitors -- retailers, reporters, friends -- at the office. "The motion, the fastness, the demands, from early in the morning to late in the evening and often seven days a week -- everything's too intense," he said. "I can't come down anymore."
"There are still so many other things in life I would like to do," he continued. "I love fashion, and even when I close the door, I'm going to love fashion. But sometimes it's just too much. Just too much."
The Courage to Stop
The official retirement age in Belgium is 65. Mr. Van Noten said he began thinking about retiring as he approached 60, talking it over with Mr. Vangheluwe, whose official title may be creative director but who functions more, he said, as Mr. Van Noten's "mirror," or gut check.
"He liked the idea," Mr. Van Noten said. "Being together with your partner day and night, it's not always easy, but thank you, Patrick, for staying close and helping me through all the good and the less good moments."
The weight of the company, and the unrelenting seasons, had become "really heavy," Mr. Vangheluwe said. "Sometimes Dries suffers with not getting the result he wants, and that's hard to see. And then also, it's dangerous. What if he had become sick or had an accident? This whole company is depending so much on us."
Mr. Van Noten said he had no actual health issues, but he sees an osteopath every Wednesday morning at 6:30 because a few months ago he developed two frozen shoulders and couldn't raise his arms above his rib cage.
"It's kind of my yoga, my shrink -- the whole thing in half an hour," he said.
First, he considered closing the company, but he was worried about putting his employees out of work. So he started to look for potential partners. Most of them (he would not say which) wanted to move the house to Paris or Milan; he was insistent that it remain in Antwerp.
"It's part of our soul," he said, "and the fact that you're not in the big fashion city creates kind of a healthy distance. You make different clothes."
After he settled on Puig, he arranged to stay on for five years to ensure a smooth transition. Covid added a year. Now, Mr. Van Noten said, "it's a healthy company. So maybe it's better to have the courage to stop on the high end, when people didn't really expect it, and they are sad rather than saying, 'It's time he closes his door."'
Besides, he will remain attached, sort of. He will stay involved in the beauty line, which he calls "the soul of the brand," as well as store design, and act as an adviser. His staff, he said, will wean him off making decisions, asking just enough but not too much.
"For me, it's quite comforting," he said. "It's given me hope that I still can give a bit of guidelines. And once in a while say, 'Oh, maybe then you go too far."' Still, he knows no one is obligated to act on what he says. And if they don't?
"It is going to hurt," Mr. Van Noten said. "But that's part of the game, part of the decision."
'The Last Thing I Want'
In Mr. Van Noten's office, piles of fabric have been replaced by piles of letters from all over the world. One woman wrote that as a girl she loved his work but couldn't afford it, so her mother saved up and bought her one piece every year. Later she attributed her professional success to her Dries wardrobe and the fact that "people always saw her as a person wearing quite strong clothes," he recalled. Another had a photo of three generations of women dressed in Dries. The oldest wore a design from his latest collection, the youngest, a vintage piece that had been her grandmother's.
The letters, Mr. Van Noten said, made him appreciate anew the power of fashion. They also illustrate the stakes for his successor. Though he can provide thoughts on that, he will not be involved in the final decision. Whomever it is, though, "I hope they're going to surprise me," he said. He's interested in the idea that he may think, "Oooh, that's strange."
On the other hand, he said, "It would be a pity if somebody just comes in and says, like: 'Rip everything out. We're going to do something completely different and just keep your name.' I think then I would be really sick."
"A brand is standing for something," he went on. "Just because you have an ego as a designer doesn't mean that first names have to be dropped and store designs have to be changed. What a pity, all that material going to waste. The whole thing now of designers changing and changing and changing again worries me a lot. The last thing I want is that my name becomes just a name that is put on different collections. And that happens so much."
Ms. Demeulemeester's brand is on its fourth designer since she left. "It took me some years to be able to have distance and not be unhappy," she said. "But you only have one life. If you want to do something else, or if you want to be free, it's the only way."
To prepare himself for the changeover, Mr. Van Noten has been taking a lot of walks with Mr. Vangheluwe and their Airedale, Scott, in the 55-acre park filled with roses and fields of daisies and ancient, towering trees around Ringenhof, the 19th-century house outside Antwerp that the couple rescued from decrepitude. (The gardeners are already getting nervous, Mr. Van Noten said, about having him around a lot more.) He sometimes swims up to five times a day in the bay below his house in Italy. The water is, he said, "very healing."
Mr. Van Noten is not yet good at relaxation. ("It's the Jesuit part," Mr. Vangheluwe said. "It's ingrained.") He has meetings scheduled through September about new stores and the expansion of the perfume line. He wants to travel and read the books that sit in piles in his homes.
He doesn't want to make a book about his work, though. He's not interested in looking back. He scoffed at the idea of producing homewares, despite the fact that the green brocade tablecloth in his dining room is from his company, and original textiles were part of his signature as a designer. He is plotting a larger project that involves young people, craft and elevating the virtues of staying small. Other designers have started getting in touch to ask his advice on retirement.
First, though, he must get through his last show.
As to what to expect (other than tears), he said: "I didn't want a 'best of.' I still want to take a step forward. This is my last chance. The only thing that I expect is perfection."

ANTWERP, Belgium — On a recent afternoon, designer Dries Van Noten sat in the sprawling old warehouse that houses his Antwerp headquarters, with its bare concrete walls, vintage oak cupboards and views over the city’s harbor. He was altering a jacket for his coming menswear show: a nip here, a seam moved there. Then, Van Noten said, a member of his team pointed out that it was the last piece of the men’s collection this season.
As Van Noten recounted later, “I said, ‘That’s not the last piece of the men’s collection: It’s the last piece of my career.’”
In March, six years after selling the company he founded in 1986 to Puig, a Spanish luxury group, Van Noten, 66, did something truly rare in fashion: He announced his retirement. This menswear show, next Saturday in Paris, will be his last.
Immediately after the news went out, he retreated to his home on the Amalfi Coast in Italy with his partner in life and fashion, Patrick Vangheluwe, the creative director of his brand, who is also retiring. It has been, he said, “an emotional roller coaster.”
Some days, he said, he thinks: “Oh, my God, why? I don’t know why. Some days I’m completely convinced. Some days I’m like, it’s too early.”
His team has begun designing the women’s collection for September, and he has caught sight of samples. “You think, ‘Oh, they’re selecting that color?’ But I can’t say anything.” He snorted at his inability to disengage. “OK, it’s not working completely.”
He wore his usual navy sweater, white T-shirt and chinos, sitting in his office, which he is in the middle of packing up. (He is moving into a smaller space in the warehouse.) “I already cleaned up a lot, mentally preparing myself,” he said. “It’s not really a divorce, but it feels quite symbolic.”
Every once in a while, as he spoke, his eyes got glassy, and he blinked and looked away. “After the men’s show, I’m going to have another email address,” he said. “I’m not going to be @driesvannoten anymore. I have to find an Instagram name now, because my Instagram is Dries Van Noten, and that is the brand. It’s strange. That I didn’t see coming.”
For almost 40 years, ever since he was 28, he dedicated himself to building his vision of how people should dress: an almost alchemical combination of clashing colors and ideas — masculinity and femininity, salmon pink and cobalt blue, geometrics and irises, the collegiate and the baroque — that in his hands somehow finds harmony. Now he must leave it in others’ care.
“It’s scary,” he said. “It’s a big void. It’s like, What is going to happen after, with my name?”
The Business ‘Takes Years to Leave Your Body’
Fashion is notoriously bad at retirement and succession planning. Karl Lagerfeld, the designer of Chanel, Fendi and his own label, died midwork at age 85 in 2019. Ralph Lauren, 84, and Giorgio Armani, 89, are still firmly in control of the houses they founded. So is Rei Kawakubo, 81; Yohji Yamamoto, 80; and Miuccia Prada and Patrizio Bertelli (75 and 78). Jil Sander, who sold her company to Prada in 1999, ended up returning to the brand that bears her name not just once but twice before finally cutting the strings.
Notably, two of the most successful retirements were actually managed by Van Noten’s peers from Belgium: Martin Margiela, who sold his fashion house to Only the Brave in 2002, left in 2009 and has refashioned himself as an artist; and Ann Demeulemeester stepped down in 2013 and is focusing on furniture design.
When you tell someone you want to leave fashion, Demeulemeester said, “Everybody says: ‘What? No! You can’t do that. You’re crazy. It’s not possible.’”
Like Van Noten, Demeulemeester belonged to the Antwerp Six, a group of Belgian designers who came to Paris in the 1980s and deconstructed formal notions of beauty and dress. She and Van Noten are close friends — they live outside Antwerp and share a passion for gardening — and she serves as an example of how to have a happy life after fashion. Still, Vangheluwe said, she told him the business “takes years to leave your body.”
“In the beginning, it’s hard,” Demeulemeester said. “I could feel it in my bones when it was showtime in Paris.” Of Van Noten, she said: “I was not sure he would dare to do it. When he said it, I said, ‘Bravo.’”
What makes Van Noten’s decision particularly striking is that he is more popular than ever. In the 1990s, in Paris, he was a bit of an odd man out: a fabulous colorist in an age of minimalism, a believer in the virtues of wearable clothes when high-concept fashion was more the rage. Now, however, his decision to build his brand his way is revered, and his work seems almost an act of faith, glorious proof that tensions can be resolved — and in the best possible way. He was made a baron for his services to Belgium in 2017, and his picture greets visitors at Brussels Airport, along with other national landmarks. So why retire?
“Fashion is not a profession,” Van Noten said. “It’s a way of life. And it’s an addiction.” Like most addictions, at a certain point, it gets out of control.
“Patrick and I never went on holiday for more than a week,” Van Noten said. “Maybe once 10 days.” He was involved in every aspect of his business, down to the chocolate (Pierre Marcolini) served to visitors — retailers, reporters, friends — at the office. “The motion, the fastness, the demands, from early in the morning to late in the evening and often seven days a week — everything’s too intense. I can’t come down anymore.
“There are still so many other things in life I would like to do,” he continued. “I love fashion, and even when I close the door, I’m going to love fashion. But sometimes it’s just too much. Just too much.”
The Courage to Stop
The official retirement age in Belgium is 65. Van Noten said he began thinking about retiring as he approached 60, talking it over with Vangheluwe, whose official title may be creative director but who functions more, he said, as Van Noten’s “mirror,” or gut check.
“He liked the idea,” Van Noten said. “Being together with your partner day and night, it’s not always easy, but thank you, Patrick, for staying close and helping me through all the good and the less good moments.”
The weight of the company, and the unrelenting seasons, had become “really heavy,” Vangheluwe said. “Sometimes Dries suffers with not getting the result he wants, and that’s hard to see. And then also, it’s dangerous. What if he had become sick or had an accident? This whole company is depending so much on us.”
Van Noten said he had no actual health issues, but he sees an osteopath every Wednesday morning at 6:30 because a few months ago he developed two frozen shoulders and couldn’t raise his arms above his rib cage.
“It’s kind of my yoga, my shrink — the whole thing in half an hour,” he said.
First he considered closing the company, but he was worried about putting his employees out of work. So he started to look for potential partners. Most of them (he would not say which) wanted to move the house to Paris or Milan; he insisted that it remain in Antwerp.
“It’s part of our soul,” he said, “and the fact that you’re not in the big fashion city creates kind of a healthy distance. You make different clothes.”
After he settled on Puig, he arranged to stay on for five years to ensure a smooth transition. COVID added a year. Now “it’s a healthy company,” Van Noten said. “So maybe it’s better to have the courage to stop on the high end, when people didn’t really expect it, and they are sad rather than saying, ‘It’s time he closes his door.’”
Besides, he will remain attached, sort of. He will stay involved in the beauty line, which he calls “the soul of the brand,” as well as store design, and act as an adviser. His staff, he said, will wean him off making decisions, asking just enough but not too much.
“For me, it’s quite comforting,” he said. “It’s given me hope that I still can give a bit of guidelines. And once in a while say, ‘Oh, maybe then you go too far.’” Still, he knows no one is obligated to act on what he says. And if they don’t? “It is going to hurt,” Van Noten said. “But that’s part of the game, part of the decision.”
‘The Last Thing I Want’
In Van Noten’s office, piles of fabric have been replaced by piles of letters from all over the world. One woman wrote that as a girl she loved his work but couldn’t afford it, so her mother saved up and bought her one piece every year. Later she attributed her professional success to her Dries wardrobe and the fact that “people always saw her as a person wearing quite strong clothes,” he recalled. Another had a photo of three generations of women dressed in Dries. The oldest wore a design from his latest collection; the youngest, a vintage piece that had been her grandmother’s.
The letters, Van Noten said, made him appreciate anew the power of fashion. They also illustrate the stakes for his successor. Though he can provide thoughts on that, he will not be involved in the final decision. Whoever it is, though, “I hope they’re going to surprise me,” he said. He’s interested in the idea that he may think, “Oooh, that’s strange.”
On the other hand, he said, “It would be a pity if somebody just comes in and says, like: ‘Rip everything out. We’re going to do something completely different and just keep your name.’ I think then I would be really sick.
“A brand is standing for something,” he went on. “Just because you have an ego as a designer doesn’t mean that first names have to be dropped and store designs have to be changed. What a pity, all that material going to waste. The whole thing now of designers changing and changing and changing again worries me a lot. The last thing I want is that my name becomes just a name that is put on different collections. And that happens so much.”
Demeulemeester’s brand is on its fourth designer since she left. “It took me some years to be able to have distance and not be unhappy,” she said. “But you only have one life. If you want to do something else, or if you want to be free, it’s the only way.”
To prepare himself for the changeover, Van Noten has been taking a lot of walks with Vangheluwe and their Airedale, Scott, in the 55-acre park filled with roses and fields of daisies and ancient, towering trees around Ringenhof, the 19th-century house outside Antwerp that the couple rescued from decrepitude. (The gardeners are already getting nervous, Van Noten said, about having him around a lot more.) He sometimes swims up to five times a day in the bay below his house in Italy. The water is, he said, “very healing.”
Van Noten is not yet good at relaxation. (“It’s the Jesuit part,” Vangheluwe said. “It’s ingrained.”) He has meetings scheduled through September about new stores and the expansion of the perfume line. He wants to travel and read the books that sit in piles in his homes.
He doesn’t want to make a book about his work, though. He’s not interested in looking back. He scoffed at the idea of producing homewares, despite the fact that the green brocade tablecloth in his dining room is from his company, and original textiles were part of his signature as a designer. He is plotting a project that involves young people, craft and elevating the virtues of staying small. Other designers have started asking his advice on retirement.
First, he must get through his last show. As to what to expect (other than tears), he said: “I didn’t want a ‘best of.’ I still want to take a step forward. This is my last chance. The only thing that I expect is perfection.”

Full text: On the third floor of a building in SoHo, Jenna Lyons sat frantically scrubbing a pair of Lanvin shoes.
"This has been a long time coming," said the 55-year-old former J. Crew president and "Real Housewives of New York City" star. "Every time I would buy something, I would realize that there was no place for it."
So she did what many New Yorkers in this situation would do: host a stoop sale.
"When I moved to Brooklyn, that was the first time I'd ever seen a stoop sale. I thought it was so cute. People would just sit outside and watch people come by and haggle -- I hope people don't haggle me today," said Ms. Lyons, who is originally from California.
The event ended up being a much larger, more stressful production than a typical New York stoop sale -- and it didn't take place on a stoop. Ms. Lyons had to institute a cover charge to help manage the crowd, and a "Real Housewives" film crew was present asking visitors to sign waivers. At first, Ms. Lyons said she pushed back against the filming -- "I was like 'please no, I just want to have a sale."'
Up until a few minutes before it started, Ms. Lyons was pricing final items with her team buzzing around, putting up printed images of her wearing some of the items.
"It's L-O-U, I should know that," she said, writing out a tag in red Sharpie for a pair of Christian Louboutin shoes.
Meanwhile, the line outside continued to grow, wrapping around the block -- over 300 people attended in the end, a representative for Ms. Lyons wrote over email. (Ms. Lyons's neighbor, the artist Joan Jonas, got early access, looking through the racks before the crowds entered.)
"I love that she's like masculine-feminine, but makes it sexy," said Zanni Baas, a 32-year-old jewelry designer who waited in line with her newly adopted black Chihuahua named Gomez.
It's the golden age of the celebrity closet sale, and Ms. Lyons's event is just the latest in a recent series of high-profile wardrobe purges. In May, Ivy Getty, the oil heiress, sold several of her worn (and some unworn) articles of clothing at a showroom in Brooklyn. The actress Chloë Sevigny opened up her closet to shoppers last spring, which also resulted in hordes of hopeful buyers lining up. And last summer, Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon held a closet sale in Los Angeles.
Last week, Ms. Lyons -- who has over 800,000 followers on Instagram -- announced her sale on the platform with a post that received over 1,000 comments and nearly 30,000 likes. She then posted again this week to announce extended hours, the $ 15 cover charge that would be applied toward purchases and that 50 percent of the proceeds would be donated to Planned Parenthood. Some commenters were angry: "A cover charge?? For a street sale??" one user posted. But others expressed excitement, inquiring about her clothing size.
Ms. Lyons later responded with a video of herself posted to her Instagram story. "First of all, 50 percent of the proceeds are going to charity and the other 50 percent are paying all the people who are working on this and going to fund my teeth, which I had to pay for out of pocket," she said. In the past, Ms. Lyons has been vocal about her genetic disorder, incontinentia pigmenti, and that she's had to get fake teeth as a result.
Hundreds of apparel items were arranged inside, with prices ranging from completely free to hundreds of dollars. Among the articles were a Celine tunic for $ 400, a pink Miu Miu jacket for $ 250, Jimmy Choo shoes for $ 20, a Simone Rocha dress for $ 650 and a Gucci sweater for $ 45. There was a rack dedicated to blazers, of which there were over two dozen, and naturally, there were plenty of J. Crew pieces -- including a one-of-a-kind jacket made with real gold bullion and crystals priced at $ 100. "Honestly, the pricing in here makes zero sense," Ms. Lyons joked.
Wearing Carhartt pants and white Prada shoes, she pointed out the items in the sale that were attached to big moments in her life. A sequined top she sported to meet Kate Middleton, a J. Crew Collection piece she wore to Michelle Obama's 50th birthday party, a Marc Jacobs skirt she donned on her wedding night and the first Marc Jacobs handbag she owned. "It was the first thing I bought with the very first bonus I got."
Ms. Lyons seemed fairly calm letting go of so many sentimental items, but there was one she removed from the sale racks at the last minute: a hot pink Schiaparelli skirt she wore to her first Met Gala.
Many people in line were fans of Ms. Lyons pre-"Real Housewives" fame, including Karen Revis, a 62-year-old artist, and Monifa Hunt, a 50-year-old baker. They had watched Ms. Lyons's other reality show, "Stylish With Jenna Lyons." When asked what she hoped to find at the sale, Ms. Revis said, "Her." She continued, jokingly, "If you hear kicking and screaming inside, that's us!"
Sara Ruble and Janna Hagey, both 30, met while being among the first people in line. Ms. Hagey, who works in marketing, arrived hours before the sale opened at 2 p.m. even though it was a work day. ("I work remote," she explained.) She'd just gotten engaged, so she was looking for something to wear on her wedding day.
Once inside, Ms. Ruble, a nurse, said that she got a hug from Ms. Lyons, in addition to Tory Burch sweats, a J. Crew skirt, Nike tennis shoes, a clutch and more. Ms. Hagey's haul included a Balenciaga bag, a Saint Laurent button up and Manolo Blahniks.
"It was also so cool because I got a new friend out of it," Ms. Ruble said, referring to Ms. Hagey. "Best day."
For Ms. Lyons, apart from clearing up space (mentally and physically), there was also a more existential reason for having the sale.
"My mom passed away last year, and she cleaned out her house, and it was actually really nice for me and my brother," she said. "I was like, no one wants to deal with this. Who knows, I could die tomorrow!"

Late-Night Partyers No Longer Welcome: [Real Estate Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Scott Sartiano proposed bringing his Manhattan-based members-only hot spot, Zero Bond, to a historic village inn. Local residents are not rolling out the red carpet.
Whether it's complaints about air traffic at the East Hampton airport, teenagers partying on the beach or the arrival of Uber and Lyft drivers, the controversies that dominate the news cycle on the East End of Long Island, N.Y., are usually about one thing: noise -- and who, in a place where residents are used to getting nearly everything they want, is allowed to make it.
This summer, media fireworks are popping over Zero Bond, the members-only club in Lower Manhattan that is attempting to open an outpost here four years after it became the ne plus ultra of downtown status spots -- the place Page Six wrote about because it was where Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson had their second date, where Gigi Hadid celebrated her 27th birthday, where Elon Musk hosted his after party for the Met Gala and where Eric Adams made himself at home during his 2021 mayoral campaign.
Much like that of a Birkin bag, Zero Bond's appeal is due (at least in part) to how difficult it is to gain access. As its founder, Scott Sartiano, has said, "You can't buy cool."
Although having money helps: After submitting an application, a suggested letter of recommendation from a current member and a headshot, anyone who wishes to join the club must also pay a onetime initiation fee and yearly dues, which increase with the age of the applicant. (Those under 28 pay a $ 750 onetime fee and $ 2,750 annually; those over 45, a $ 5,000 initiation fee and $ 4,400 annually.)
Mr. Sartiano's efforts to establish his private club in a centuries-old building known as the Hedges Inn, currently a 13-room luxury bed-and-breakfast, have been widely reported. But while he is said to be negotiating to lease the property, even town officials do not have confirmation of whether an agreement has been signed.
Mr. Sartiano declined numerous requests for comment. So did John Cumming, the owner of the Hedges Inn, although he emailed a statement saying that "the future of the Hedges Inn is an important and sensitive topic to everyone involved" and expressing confidence that "the next 40+ years of this iconic inn will be as bright as its past."
Wherever things currently stand with the lease, many neighbors aren't pleased. On May 18, in the latest salvo, the East Hampton Village Mayor, Jerry Larsen, and the board of trustees passed a law requiring restaurants in the historic district to close and have all customers out by 11 p.m., which would put a damper on Zero Bond's business, should the club move it. (Mr. Larsen had hoped to establish a 10 p.m. closing time, but encountered resistance from restaurants in the area.)
Back in March, when Mr. Sartiano began his campaign, he attempted to win over the East Hampton mayor by promising to have the New York City mayor, Eric Adams, call and attest to his character.
"I told them not to waste Mr. Adams's time," Mr. Larsen said. "It was not going to change my mind."
"One of the lost things in this world is quietude," said Carrie Doyle, a village trustee. "People come out for peace and quiet, and the ironic thing is that to get it you have to make a lot of noise. So that's what we've done."
But the dispute is about more than decibel levels -- it's also about access. One argument repeatedly made for keeping Zero Bond out of East Hampton has do with the club's insistence that it be welcomed by people it might not welcome in return as members. And the Hamptons is a particularly difficult place to make that pitch.
No Longer a Quiet Getaway
Almost anyone who goes to the Hamptons can tell you that it long ago shed its reputation as the quiet getaway spot where Jackson Pollock hid out and splash painted his way through existential despair.
The Stephen Talkhouse, in Amagansett, has hosted shows by Jon Bon Jovi and Jimmy Buffett. The lines to the bathroom at the Surf Lodge in Montauk are legendary enough to have inspired their own New York Times article. And that didn't stop Malia Obama from celebrating her birthday on the outdoor deck.
So it made sense that Zero Bond would try to open in the Hamptons, said Corey Dolgon, the author of "The End of the Hamptons" and a professor of sociology at Stonehill College, in Easton, Mass.
"The Hamptons -- as symbolic of the 'richest and most famous' -- is exactly the kind of cultural capital that Zero Bond craves," he said. "Every new generation of rich and famous look to put their imprimatur on the land they are conquering."
Still, Mr. Sartiano picked a tricky spot for his clubhouse.
"Montauk has all those hotels," said Kathleen Cunningham, the executive director of the Village Preservation Society of East Hampton. "There's tons of commercial property, and that's part of why it is a party scene -- because it can be. The commercial slice of East Hampton is much smaller, and therefore what is permitted and what should be permitted is different."
Beyond that, while the Hamptons is no longer exactly quiet, the party scene is a shadow of what it was in the early 2000s, when Lizzie Grubman famously crashed her black Mercedes S.U.V. outside a Southampton nightclub called the Conscience Point Inn, injuring 16 people.
"The era of major nightclubs is over," said Nick Kraus, a partner at the Talkhouse, rattling off a list of now-shuttered clubs that were known for their popularity with the plastic surgery set and detested for the inclination of those patrons to pitch their plastic cups onto the street. "Those places have become Pier Ones or dog parks," he said, adding, "The towns bought them because they were nuisances and then transformed them."
'I Hate to Lose'
Among the residents disturbed by the prospect of having Zero Bond as a neighbor is Kenneth Lipper, a former New York City deputy mayor under Ed Koch who became a titan of finance, serving as a partner at Lehman Brothers and Salomon Brothers before opening Lipper & Co., which manages investments for high-net-worth individuals. (He also wrote the novel "Wall Street," which was based on the 1987 movie by Oliver Stone.)
Mr. Lipper, who lives on a side street a few hundred feet from the Hedges Inn, has shown up at village board meetings to oppose the lease of the property to Mr. Sartiano, including the meeting last week where the 11 p.m. closing time was established.
While Mr. Lipper said he had never exactly been close to Mr. Cumming, things between them were always cordial. He also knew Mr. Cumming's father, Ian Cumming, a billionaire investment banker, who lived on the block and died in 2018 at 78.
Last summer, he ran into Mr. Cumming at a party in the Hamptons. "He said he had to make money at the Hedges Inn," Mr. Lipper recalled. "'Everything has to make money.' I kind of rolled my eyes." He added later, "It's mental gymnastics. It has nothing to do with real business or actual need."
Mr. Lipper likened it to "Wall Street." "It reminds me of that line," he said. "'Greed is good,' a kind of modern Gordon Gekko attitude."
Mr. Larsen, the mayor, has framed the issue as being principally about noise.
"Even the slightest thing of cars idling in the parking lot next to somebody's house, people talking late at night in a parking lot -- after people have drinks, sometimes they come out laughing, and they're louder than they would normally be -- all of that is going to disrupt the neighbors, because that's how close the houses are," he said.
But others have suggested that he may have a personal incentive to keep Zero Bond out of East Hampton.
In the past, the mayor has been decidedly pro-business. He has hiked parking charges, introduced a plan to privatize ambulance service and secured funding from Prada, which operates a store on Main street, to pay for the lighting of the Christmas tree in the center of town -- where Santa Claus arrived for the 2022 lighting ceremony by police helicopter.
But the possibility of a nightclub opening in a primarily residential part of the village posed an obvious problem for him, said David Rattray, the editor of The East Hampton Star, the town's main newspaper.
Being the village mayor, Mr. Rattray pointed out, is a side job that pays Mr. Larsen around $ 26,000 a year. His principal source of income comes from Protec Security, a private security firm he runs with his wife, Lisa Larsen.
"He has clients within earshot," said Mr. Rattray, whose newspaper is headquartered across the street from the Hedges. "His trucks are there daily."
Indeed, it was not hard to find triangular Protec signs sprouting from the lawns of numerous homes nearby: one less than a quarter of a mile from the Hedges on the corner of Main Street and James Lane; another at the house directly behind Mr. Lipper's; and more on Huntting Lane, Middle Lane, Egypt Lane and West Dune Lane.
When asked about a possible conflict of interest, the mayor more or less shrugged. "If someone came before the board of trustees," he said, and he was doing business with that person, "I would have to recuse myself."
Still, residents are bracing for a battle that could stretch into next summer, all hinging on a lease and a liquor license.
Liquor licenses granted by the New York State Liquor Authority allow businesses to sell alcohol until 4 a.m., but counties are able to further restrict these hours with their own legislation. And this could set up a potential legal battle between Mr. Sartiano and the village officials. But perhaps not -- for this summer, at least -- if Mr. Sartiano runs out of time to get the club up and running. Marcos Baladron, the East Hampton Village administrator, said there is no indication that Mr. Sartiano has signed a lease, much less obtained a liquor license, a process that can take nearly a year. And the mayor noted that the State Liquor Authority will consult the village before giving Mr. Sartiano a license to serve alcohol.
It continues to puzzle them, though, why Mr. Cumming has been so intent on doing business with Zero Bond. "I let the owner know, 'If you really want to sell the place, I can give you a list of individuals who are happy to purchase,"' Mr. Baladron said. "'And none of them would do something the village would hate to see."'
He did seem to understand, however, why Mr. Sartiano won't give up.
Earlier this spring, Mr. Baladron said, he suggested that if Mr. Sartiano was set on coming to the Hamptons, there were far better places to go. "He could go to Montauk and have zero resistance," Mr. Baladron said. "Instead, he's opening in a property that's defective in terms of what he wants to do -- it's not even a good business decision."
He recalled Mr. Sartiano's response: "I hate to lose."

The Hamptons long ago shed its reputation as a quiet getaway, but the party scene today is a shadow of what it was.

Full text: Donald J. Trump was for decades a creature of New York. But in recent years, the city that helped make him seems more eager to break him.
New York City was once Donald J. Trump's playground, the place where he made his name and then plastered it everywhere he could.
Now, the city that helped make him rich and famous has become his battleground. And Mr. Trump keeps losing.
His conviction this week was the third and heaviest blow the former president has been dealt in his erstwhile hometown this year -- a series of challenges to his ego, his bottom line, and now, perhaps, his freedom.
His felony conviction on Thursday, delivered by a jury of 12 Manhattan residents, brought with it the possibility that he could eventually be imprisoned in New York, a far cry from the image he spent decades cultivating as a real estate mogul and man about town.
In February, Mr. Trump endured another humiliation: a judgment of more than $ 450 million in a civil fraud case brought by the state's attorney general, Letitia James, for overvaluing his net worth. The ruling undermined a central element of his public identity as a brilliant businessman.
And in January, another jury in Manhattan ordered the former president to pay $ 83.3 million for defaming the writer E. Jean Carroll, whom Mr. Trump had already been found liable for sexually abusing in a changing room at Bergdorf Goodman in the 1990s.
Taken as a whole, the three cases have steadily chipped away at the persona Mr. Trump built across his decades in New York City, even as most polls show him continuing to lead this fall's presidential race.
Election results from 2016 and 2020 in Manhattan, where Mr. Trump lost badly, suggest he wore out his welcome there some time ago. On Friday, as the latest big blow sunk in, some New Yorkers seemed to suggest they were happy he had relocated to Florida.
"I think that a lot of people feel that way about him: that he is old news," said George Arzt, a longtime political and media consultant who has known Mr. Trump for decades and who worked for Mayor Ed Koch, who died in 2013 and was one of Mr. Trump's nemeses. Many New Yorkers, Mr. Arzt said, "would like to push him out of the headlines."
Mr. Trump, at a Trump Tower news conference on Friday, criticized the 34-felony verdict sharply and said that he planned to appeal. But he also seemed to acknowledge that the charges he had been convicted of -- falsifying business records -- hit at the heart of his image as a master of financial dealings.
"It sounds so bad when they say falsifying this, that's a bad thing for me," he said. "I've never had that before."
The criminal trial, like the civil fraud case, pulled back the curtain on many of Mr. Trump's business practices, as prosecutors dove into his penny-pinching and his refusal to pay debts, including initially stalling to pay a porn star the $ 130,000 sum at the center of the case.
Such a tale -- sex with a beautiful woman -- might once have fit perfectly with the image of Mr. Trump as a bachelor playboy, which was burnished by the city's tabloids.
But Ms. Daniels's testimony was anything but flattering to the former president. The sex with the married Mr. Trump was brief and unmemorable, she said, and was followed by requests for more encounters, which she rebuffed. (Mr. Trump denies having had sex with Ms. Daniels.)
On Friday, Republicans were furious about the verdict, with conservative leaders urging Republican district attorneys and attorneys general to "indict the left" while other supporters of Mr. Trump called for a boycott of New York City.
Mr. Trump's Republican allies in Congress called the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, and one of the prosecutors who worked on the case, Matthew Colangelo, to testify there.
Much of the outrage among conservatives was met with outright joy in many corners of New York City.
"I woke up with a smile on my face," said Robert Clark, 63, a photographer who lives in Brooklyn's Williamsburg neighborhood and who had spent the morning hunting for a copy of The New York Times to add to his collection of famous front pages. "I want to see the cover!"
Others were even more blunt.
"His legacy is just beyond trash," said Mark Samuels, 70, a retiree who worked in advertising and grew up on Staten Island. That was not always so, he added. For a time, he said, Mr. Trump made a certain garish sense in the New York of the 1970s and '80s.
Those days are long over, Mr. Samuels said: "We're in one of the most important cities on earth and he came and he fell. It's his rise and fall."
Mr. Trump's reputation among some of the city's elite was always tied to his origins as a striver from Queens whose father was also a developer who made his name and fortune outside Manhattan.
Mr. Trump tried and succeeded in breaking into the Manhattan market. But Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City, a business group, said he was "not a joiner" when it came to New York's business community.
"He always wanted to be the Lone Ranger," she said.
That included when he was embarking on seemingly civic-minded projects like his much-ballyhooed (by him, among others) renovation of Central Park's Wollman Rink.
And so, she said, the city's business community had not exactly turned on him: "Because who was ever rooting for him?"
Mr. Trump has his supporters among the city's eight million-plus residents. There are more conservative neighborhoods in all five boroughs, and a Republican stronghold -- and congresswoman -- on Staten Island.
On Friday, in front of Trump Tower, his supporters filled the sidewalks, engaging in shouting matches with anti-Trump protesters. They carried handmade signs and flags, including one seen in front of a Prada store reading "Trump or Death."
Colleen Ortiz, 50, who was on her way to work, said she felt "the Democrats and the powers that be do not want him in office."
"I personally feel this is going to backfire and he is going to win in November," added Ms. Ortiz, who lives in the Bronx.
Inside, Mr. Trump, who had been giving remarks in a dingy courthouse hallway every day during the trial, seemingly sought to regain some glamour during the news conference, in the building's marble-and-brass atrium. On his way to the lectern, he passed the escalators that carried him down to his 2015 announcement of his first run for president.
Standing in front of a row of American flags, he gave a rambling speech, attacking the case, the judge and the Democrats, and expounding on baseless conspiracy theories about President Biden orchestrating the Manhattan case, and a nefarious plot to rid the nation of cars. He called the trial "very unfair" and a "scam." He left without answering questions.
At Trump Village Estates, an apartment complex in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn that Mr. Trump's father, Fred Trump, built, Vernon Schlamowitz, 89, said it was not surprising that 12 Manhattan residents had convicted the former president.
"Just like the judge, handpicked. All Democrats," Mr. Schlamowitz said of the jurors. (The jurors' identities have not been made public, and their party affiliations are unknown.)
He also seemed proud to live in a building that bears the Trump name.
"I think he was a better businessman than his father," he said, "but he took a lot more risks, and has fallen into a lot of problems along the way."
Some New Yorkers seemed to recognize that the city itself -- with its "make-it-there, make-it-anywhere" ethos and constant capitalist churn -- had helped to create Mr. Trump's identity.
"I suppose New York allowed some of it to flourish," said Sarah Williams, 72, a semiretired psychiatrist for the city who has lived in Brooklyn for 36 years. She sighed. "That's New York," she added. "I think more and more we're all just about money. Which is really unfortunate because I love New York."
Still, for many city residents, the verdict itself seemed to vindicate their distaste for the 45th president.
Lennox Hannan, 63, a writer who lives in Williamsburg, said he was "overjoyed" and compared Mr. Trump to a mafia boss, Richard Nixon and even more unsavory characters.
He also said the verdict also swelled his pride as a New Yorker, saying "the beginning of his downfall" had happened in the city.
"It's fitting the first justice he's faced has been in New York City," Mr. Hannan said. "It all comes back to New York City."

NEW YORK — New York City was once Donald J. Trump’s playground, the place where he made his name and then plastered it everywhere he could.

Brooke Shields on Aging and Empowerment: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Some stories are so perfect and poignant that even if we suspect they are not true, we simply do not want to know.
There is a white peacock perched inside Brooke Shields's home in New York City. She named it Steve. He sits frozen on an acrylic pedestal, feathers draped to the floor. Ms. Shields was told he was rescued from other peafowl, who can turn aggressive toward their old, pecking them to death.
"I'm probably being lied to through the beak," said Ms. Shields, whose pun usage can be contagious. But the story made sense to her. She sighed at the taxidermy. "The really beautiful ones are all male. Doesn't it figure?"
There is no universal experience of aging. But surely some American women can relate to feeling pecked or prodded, and pushed aside when they reach middle age.
At least that was a sentiment shared with Ms. Shields in 2021, when she founded an online community called Beginning Is Now. More than 100,000 people followed the group's Instagram account, which posted inspirational content for women over 40.
It felt very much like a women's magazine -- with interviews, listicles, giveaways and recurring columns (Dear Brooke and Brooke Don't Cook) -- though without all of the advertising. Beginning Is Now mostly sold merch: workout sets and bright yellow hoodies.
Occasionally Ms. Shields would host group Zoom calls with her followers. They would ask questions like, "Do you feel like you're being overlooked?" Ms. Shields would answer: "As a woman, yes, I feel that somehow, once we hit a certain age, it's assumed that we're no longer sexy." Another woman would chime in: "'It's as if the light switches have been turned off,"' Ms. Shields said.
"It wasn't angry," she said of the tenor of the conversations. "I was worried that there would be this undercurrent of anger. There was more of an undercurrent of bewilderment."
It was during these Zoom calls that Beginning Is Now began to morph. Certain "fraught" age-related issues kept coming up, Ms. Shields said. Like hair -- thinning, coarsening, graying hair.
"Very soon people said, 'Well, what can we buy?"' she said.
The skin of her nascent media brand began shedding. Infographics and merch were no longer enough for Ms. Shields, who had put a small team of executives together and mined the community for ideas. In June, a new company will emerge, called Commence. It will sell three hair-care products on its website.
In the modern beauty industry, there is precedent for pivoting from content to commerce: Glossier, valued at $ 1.8 billion in 2021, was born from the blog Into the Gloss. Its first skin-care products were developed using feedback from the website's commenters.
But for anyone familiar with Ms. Shields's career, Commence also makes one of those perfect and poignant stories.
Ever since she could crawl, Ms. Shields has been the face of household products: a model for Ivory soap at 11 months, Band-Aids at 5, Colgate toothpaste at 10, Calvin Klein jeans at 15, Coppertone sunscreen at 43, La-Z-Boy furniture at 45, and that is just a highlight reel. In the 1980s, her name was put on blow dryers and curling irons and hair crimpers. "By the way, I loathe the color purple, and all of the products were purple," she said. "I didn't know I had anything to say about it."
Now, at 59, Ms. Shields is a chief executive overseeing how her products are made and how her name is used to sell them. It is capitalist empowerment.
"I've sold for other people my whole life," Ms. Shields said.
'An Accessibility'
I did not expect to find Teri Shields, famed stage mother, at her daughter's house in the West Village of Manhattan. But there she was, blending into a marble-topped bar in the living room. Among liquor bottles and barware sat Teri's urn. Ms. Shields lifted the lid to show me.
"Closest to the things that she liked the most," said Ms. Shields, whose mother died in 2012 at age 79. "Booze and me."
Their relationship formed the emotional spine of "Pretty Baby: Brooke Shields," a documentary released on Hulu last April that re-examined her early life.
The title mirrored that of a 1978 film in which Ms. Shields played a 12-year-old prostitute in early 20th-century New Orleans -- the first time she, and her mother's parenting choices, made international headlines. She became a sex symbol before she became a teenager.
Ms. Shields also discloses in the documentary that in her 20s, after graduating from Princeton University, she was raped by a Hollywood executive. She did not say his name, and to her relief and surprise, viewers moved past the revelation fairly quickly.
"I thought, 'Wow, this is a first -- so that's not all I am," Ms. Shields said. "Whereas when I was younger, my sexuality was all I was -- that and beauty."
Unlike many other celebrity documentaries, Ms. Shields did not produce the project or control the final edit. It was co-produced by people she trusted, however, including her friends Ali Wentworth and the ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos.
"I used to always say to her, 'You should either be in rehab or dead based on your childhood,"' Ms. Wentworth said. "She can be at a dinner party and tell a story, and you're laughing -- it's really entertaining -- but then you go, 'Oh, this is actually a very tragic story.' She can disassociate in a way that has protected her for her whole life."
Ms. Shields is funny and candid. But her singular gift is her ability to relate to people, even if they'll never be able to relate to her. Even among her famous friends -- like her neighbor, Bradley Cooper, who might be casually taking a call in Ms. Shields's garden on a Tuesday afternoon, unbeknown to The New York Times reporter sitting on her couch inside -- Ms. Shields's very unusual girlhood sets her apart. It isolates her. No one else on this planet was christened by Time magazine as the "look" of the 1980s.
And yet there is still "an accessibility with Brooke that people love," Ms. Wentworth said. "People feel like they know her, and that somehow, whatever she tells you to use or drink or wear, is real. A friend is telling you to do that."
Ms. Shields is well aware of her public perception, with all of its benefits (instant press when she starts a beauty brand) and drawbacks (the need to convince investors and consumers that this is not just another celebrity beauty brand in a market saturated by celebrity beauty brands).
There is always a moment -- and Ms. Shields always notices it -- when people settle into her company for the first time. They relax their grip on the idea of Brooke Shields and begin to adjust to the reality of her.
"Sometimes it's a flicker in the eye, sometimes it's an exhale," she said. Sometimes it's the moment your eyes stop flicking between Steve the peacock and Ms. Shields's rhinestone Prada loafers and the Keith Haring and Will Cotton artworks on her walls. "And then we can just do our jobs."
Privately, that was one of her motivations for pursuing the presidency of the Actors' Equity Association, a labor union representing stage performers and managers. (Ms. Shields's Broadway credits include Rizzo in "Grease," Roxie in "Chicago" and Morticia in "The Addams Family.") She saw an opportunity to champion the people who make theater possible and to use her name to bring attention to union issues. But she also liked that this job would not be explicitly about her.
"That appeals to me," said Ms. Shields, who won the election on May 24. "It's a lot of me all the time. And it has been that way since I was an infant."
'A Woman of Substance'
The summer box office may be off to a disastrous start, but as of May 23, the most-watched original film on any streaming platform was a romantic comedy starring Brooke Shields.
"Mother of the Bride" has remained in Netflix's top 10 movies, peaking at No. 1, since its release on May 9.
Of all the moving pieces of Ms. Shields's life, acting is still the thing that makes her feel like a "complete person," she said. "I go to sleep thinking about it and wake up thinking about it."
Until that moment, Ms. Shields had generally been composed and analytical in conversation -- she once stopped midsentence to deconstruct the definition of "catharsis." But when discussing her acting career, there was a new urgency in her voice: "I must continue to pursue it tirelessly," she said, sitting up in a makeup chair in a hotel bathroom, preparing for a photo shoot. There was so much pent-up desire that she seemed to struggle to express the size of it.
"If I could be in 'Hacks,"' she said, almost bursting, "that is what I want for my life. That level of humor." She recalled watching a scene from that Max series in which an iPhone is unlocked not by Face ID -- the owner's face is recovering from an eye lift -- but by the face of her wax museum figure. "I now know there is actually a God."
It is not that Ms. Shields doesn't speak about Commence with the same enthusiasm. It is just a different flavor of enthusiasm. She has raised about $ 3.5 million from investors. She can cite relevant statistics (by 2025 there will be 80 million women over 40 in the United States) and has learned the unlyrical language of the business: capitalization tables, convertible notes, price equity round, total addressable market.
But she doesn't see herself in this position forever. "I'll always be the founder," she said. "But at a certain point, we are going to grow so exponentially that it's going to take a kick-ass C.E.O. to bring us to that next level."
Last year, Ms. Shields appointed a company president, Denise Landman, who was the founder and former chief executive of Victoria's Secret Pink. That brand was tailored to young women, 18 or 19, who were "half woman, half child," Ms. Landman said. "You really haven't been humbled around too much by the world writ large."
By contrast, Ms. Landman identifies the Commence customer as "a woman of substance," someone who has accumulated knowledge and experience and pride over her decades, "much as soil layers up and becomes more nurturing over time," she said. "That substance is earned."
To Ms. Landman, who said she is in her late 60s, it is not a worthwhile exercise to dwell on problems like itchy scalps or brittle hair. "The place to dwell is, God gave me a head of hair," she said. "Let me make the most beautiful head of hair it can be."
As for Ms. Shields, she can relate to more middle-aged anxieties than one might think, she said.
Yes, she somehow survived the '80s and '90s without internalizing toxic beauty standards -- spared, she explained, by her mother's mind-set that her beauty was their path toward financial security. (Modeling was just a job with no relation to her self-worth.) And yes, she doesn't entirely mind the experience of gaining 5 or 10 pounds. ("I immediately look younger," she said. "It's like natural filler.") And yes, those eyebrows are natural and majestic.
But Ms. Shields still knows what it is like to pee a little bit when she sneezes. She still injects the crevice between her eyebrows to make it disappear before doing a movie. And she still has a minor crisis of identity over her daughters, now 18 and 21, leaving home. "If I'm not mom 24/7, who am I?" she said.
"I really identify with so much more than people have given me credit for," Ms. Shields said. "Might I remind you, I'm still a female and still human."

Some stories are so perfect and poignant that even if we suspect they are not true, we simply do not want to know.
There is a white peacock perched inside Brooke Shields’ home in New York City. She named it Steve. He sits frozen on an acrylic pedestal, feathers draped to the floor. Shields was told he was rescued from other peafowl, who can turn aggressive toward their old, pecking them to death.
“I’m probably being lied to through the beak,” said Shields, whose pun usage can be contagious. But the story made sense to her. She sighed at the taxidermy. “The really beautiful ones are all male. Doesn’t it figure?”
There is no universal experience of aging. But surely some American women can relate to feeling pecked or prodded, and pushed aside when they reach middle age.
At least that was a sentiment shared with Shields in 2021, when she founded an online community called Beginning Is Now. More than 100,000 people followed the group’s Instagram account, which posted inspirational content for women over 40.
It felt very much like a women’s magazine — with interviews, listicles, giveaways and recurring columns (Dear Brooke and Brooke Don’t Cook) — though without all of the advertising. Beginning Is Now mostly sold merch: workout sets and bright yellow hoodies.
Occasionally Shields would host group Zoom calls with her followers. They would ask questions like, “Do you feel like you’re being overlooked?” Shields would answer: “As a woman, yes, I feel that somehow, once we hit a certain age, it’s assumed that we’re no longer sexy.” Another woman would chime in: “‘It’s as if the light switches have been turned off,’” Shields said.
“It wasn’t angry,” she said of the tenor of the conversations. “I was worried that there would be this undercurrent of anger. There was more of an undercurrent of bewilderment.”
It was during these Zoom calls that Beginning Is Now began to morph. Certain “fraught” age-related issues kept coming up, Shields said. Like hair — thinning, coarsening, graying hair.
“Very soon people said, ‘Well, what can we buy?’” she said.
The skin of her nascent media brand began shedding. Infographics and merch were no longer enough for Shields, who had put a small team of executives together and mined the community for ideas. In June, a new company will emerge, called Commence. It will sell three hair-care products on its website.
In the modern beauty industry, there is precedent for pivoting from content to commerce: Glossier, valued at $1.8 billion in 2021, was born from the blog Into the Gloss. Its first skin-care products were developed using feedback from the website’s commenters.
But for anyone familiar with Shields’ career, Commence also makes one of those perfect and poignant stories.
Ever since she could crawl, Shields has been the face of household products: a model for Ivory soap at 11 months, Band-Aids at 5, Colgate toothpaste at 10, Calvin Klein jeans at 15, Coppertone sunscreen at 43, La-Z-Boy furniture at 45, and that is just a highlight reel. In the 1980s, her name was put on blow dryers and curling irons and hair crimpers. “By the way, I loathe the color purple, and all of the products were purple,” she said. “I didn’t know I had anything to say about it.”
Now, at 59, Shields is a chief executive overseeing how her products are made and how her name is used to sell them. It is capitalist empowerment.
“I’ve sold for other people my whole life,” Shields said.

Something's Missing From the Banksy Museum: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Work by the anonymous street artist is hard to find. At a museum devoted to him, it's even harder.
To enter the Banksy Museum, which opened this month above a Bank of America on the lower lip of SoHo, a visitor must wade through the thicket of vendors crowding Canal Street with bootleg Apple products and almost-convincing Prada handbags splayed out on blankets.
It's a fitting approach. The Banksy Museum does not own or display any actual Banksys but rather 167 decent-enough reproductions of them, life-size murals and paintings on panels treated to look like exterior walls that stretch through an exhibition space, designed to resemble the street.
That these replicas of Banksy's oeuvre since the late 1990s are more or less faithful to their source material has less to do with the competence of the anonymous artists who executed them than it does with the simplicity of Banksy's aesthetic: photo-derived stencil work, more about social commentary than technical proficiency.
A Banksy work does not astound with technique or formal innovation, nor is it meant to. Designed to be quickly made and quicker understood, they rely on easy visual gags that don't always amount to much, all punchline and no windup (a man walking a Keith Haring dog; riot police and protesters having a pillow fight; a boy catching snow on his tongue that's actually ash from a dumpster fire). His early political satire, like Winston Churchill with a mohawk and teddy bears lobbing Molotov cocktails, had all the profundity of a dorm room poster, a shallow populism that explains his trajectory -- populism being a sure route toward cultural phenomenon.
The world's most famous anonymous street artist, Banksy has traveled that route since the mid-2000s, inspiring a singular devotion. The appearance of a new work is heralded as a cultural event, its removal often met with protests. Few other artists are treated as prophet and savior, and fewer still who insist on a complete allergy to public life.
The Banksy Museum embodies these contradictions, probably inadvertently: unauthorized, it's an act of both admiration and exploitation. It's also an interesting thought experiment: Can you have a museum with only reproductions? Does street art still function when removed from the street? Can an artist be anti-establishment while still fetching millions of dollars at auction?
The Banksy Museum seems to not share these potential hypocrisies. It presents an unequivocal hagiography of Banksy as an art world Robin Hood, unimpeachable in his worldview and incorruptible in his manner of expression. The Banksy Museum is of course not a museum in the strict sense of the word, or even the loose one (it employs no curatorial staff, nor does it conserve or collect any artwork).
It is a museum more in the way the Museum of Ice Cream uses the concept: a ticketed, immersive experience where the experience in which you are being immersed is vague. This experience costs $ 30 for adult entry (children's tickets are $ 21), in line with what the Met charges non-New Yorkers, but at least at the Met the Matisses are real.
There is something perverse in paying to experience an ersatz street to look at artificial graffiti, as if the real version wasn't available outside for free. Between the piped-in soundtrack of police sirens and the hazard markings cordoning each work as if they were crime scenes, the space has the flavor of the life-size warehouse replica in Charlie Kaufman's "Synecdoche, New York" by way of a laser tag arena in a suburban strip mall.
Does New York need a Banksy Museum? The artist has little to do with the city's rich history of graffiti and style writing. He made a well-publicized visit here in 2013 when he created a few dozen pieces that alluded limply to the city (a rat wearing a Yankees cap; the line "This is my New York accent" rendered in a hazy wildstyle approximation) and again in 2018, and then seemed to stop thinking about the place. (One of the only known remaining artworks from the 2013 visit is near Zabar's, protected by plexiglass.) And for the most part, New York graffitists don't seem to think about Banksy much either, outside an amusing and certainly one-sided campaign by the tagger Hektad, who has been spraying and pasting forms of "Hektad vs Banksy" around the city for the last 10 years.
In fact, the Banksy Museum is simply the latest of many such Banksy Museums that the Belgian film director and producer Hazis Vardar has opened around the world since his first effort in Paris, in 2019; four are currently open. And Vardar's museums are just a part of the Banksy cottage-industry. Other unauthorized exhibitions operate around the world; street vendors can reliably be found hawking small imitations.
Banksy's own philosophy invites such entrepreneurship. "Copyright is for losers," the artist has mused. And more than lax copyright restrictions, these exhibitions take advantage of a slavering cult of personality, the kind that Banksy himself seems to counsel against, fed by the careful control of his persona and mystique.
The museum devotes a sizable section to Banksy's ostensible disdain for the art world. "Commercial success is a mark of failure for a graffiti artist," he told The Village Voice in a rare 2013 interview. It's a position complicated by his production of sellable objects and multimillion dollar auction prices, the most famous of which is the 2018 spectacle at Sotheby's, when "Girl With Balloon" partly self-destructed after selling for $ 1.4 million, a stunt meant to satirize the market's frothing speculative behavior but paradoxically only juiced its value. Sotheby's resold it in 2021 for $ 25.4 million. It's hard to have it both ways.
Banksy's ideas are utterly correct. His anti-establishment paranoid worldview has mostly been borne out: Politicians are largely craven and the wealthy often get away with fleecing the working class, and the art world is largely divorced from reality. But his righteousness is reductive -- Children: good. Adults: bad. Government: evil. Money: stupid.
In many ways this endeavor proves his point: Art has become inseparable from commerce. But the Banksy Museum ultimately fails not because of the tourist admission pricing but because any power Bansky's art possesses derives from the street. "The Banksy Museum" is the kind of thing Banksy himself might produce to mock the market's fetishization of street art: a simulacrum of the street that sanitizes its life and danger and potential -- a totally unnatural, airless tomb. Its most interesting effect may be the way in which it illustrates the limits of control.
Banksy's 2010 film, "Exit Through the Gift Shop," purports to tell the story of Thierry Guetta's rise from vintage clothier in Los Angeles to the inane street art impresario Mr. Brainwash, possibly a Banksy invention, or his own nightmare. It's a cautionary tale, a criticism of the commodification of street art, once outside the mainstream and now wholly a part of it. Naturally, of course, the Banksy Museum spits you out through a gift shop, the words "exit through the gift shop" stenciled on the floor as a wayfinding gag, winking as it misses the joke.

The Cannes Festival, with its sheer preponderance of red carpets and boardwalk photo ops, its blockbuster films and art house flicks, has given the world more indelible fashion moments than any other festival. In 2002, Sharon Stone made so many dramatic red carpet entrances as a member of the Cannes jury that she managed to revive her flagging career through the power of clothes alone.
The festival, held on the French Riviera, is taking place from May 14 to May 25 this year. It has been off to a glamorous start -- and some attendees didn't even wait for its official opening ceremony last Tuesday to throw down the fashion gauntlet.
The actress Anya Taylor-Joy, who came to Cannes to promote "Furiosa," the latest "Mad Max" movie, made waves the day before the ceremony by stepping out in a Jacquemus straw hat so large it doubled as a portable sunshade. The filmmaker Greta Gerwig, whose job as president of the festival's competition jury means packing 10 days' worth of outfits, stopped by a photo call the morning of the ceremony in an hourglass-effect, blue-and-white-striped milkmaid dress straight from the latest Maison Margiela couture collection.
Indeed, what makes the Cannes Festival such irresistible eye candy is that it's not only a parade of grand gowns and tuxedos, but also a panoply of accessible sunshine style.
The fashion show only heated up with the opening ceremony, attended by stars like Lily Gladstone and Meryl Streep, who was honored with a lifetime achievement Palme d'Or award. As the fashion editor Miranda Priestly in "The Devil Wears Prada," Ms. Streep gave the world a description of the trickle-down fashion effect that has yet to be beaten. Today the Côte d'Azur, tomorrow your closet? It's not as far-fetched as it sounds.

W.N.B.A. Stars Suit Up in Their Undies: [Style Desk]

Full text: Kim Kardashian's shapewear brand is moving more aggressively into sports.
The branding of the W.N.B.A. as the hottest league in any game continues apace, as does the growing convergence of fashion and sports.
The latest step in the relationship: a Skims ad campaign released just ahead of the start of the women's basketball season and featuring the rookie Cameron Brink, the newly retired three-time W.N.B.A. champion-turned-president of Adidas basketball Candace Parker and the All-Stars and Olympians Kelsey Plum of the Las Vegas Aces and Skylar Diggins-Smith of the Seattle Storm and DiJonai Carrington of the Connecticut Sun.
The campaign depicts the players in various skin-tone undies -- bikini and high-waist briefs, boy shorts, bandeaus and T-shirts -- accessorized with basketballs, high-heel pumps and elaborate rhinestone jewelry. It both toys with old pinup tropes and subverts them -- the women look less come hither than don't mess with me. It also frames Skims, which was founded by Kim Kardashian and Jens Grede in 2018 and valued at $ 4 billion last July, less as shapewear than haute sportswear.
It is the first Skims campaign to celebrate women players, following the brand's last two big basketball moves: a similar shoot that introduced the Skims men's line and featured Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder, among other athletes, and a campaign just in time for March Madness featuring male all-star college basketball players. (They were mostly in terry loungewear, not underwear.)
At the time, given the record-setting popularity of the women's N.C.A.A. tournament, some fans criticized Skims for focusing on male athletes rather than women. This is the answer.
It is a reflection of the growing power of the women's game and the star appeal that has been brought to the game by the new class of draft picks, who are more aware than ever of the leverage that comes from personal branding -- and associated relationships with the fashion world.
Ms. Brink, for example, the second draft pick, who is playing for the Los Angeles Sparks, wore Balmain on the W.N.B.A. orange carpet, has close to 790,000 Instagram followers and has been working with the stylist Mary Gonsalves Kinney for the last two years.
Her fellow draftee Angel Reese, who was chosen seventh by the Chicago Sky, attended the Met Gala last week in a feathered chiffon gown custom-made by 16Arlington and recently unveiled her own Good American jeans campaign. (Good American was founded by Ms. Kardashian's sister Khloé Kardashian and Emma Grede, Mr. Grede's wife.)
And Caitlin Clark, the No. 1 draft pick, chosen by the Indiana Fever, arrived for her first news conference after the W.N.B.A. draft in Indianapolis in a Louis Vuitton dress and jacket after donning an all-Prada look for the draft.
In turn, Skims, which ranked 13th in the Lyst Index of most searched fashion brands in the first quarter of 2024, has moved aggressively into sports. In October, it became the first official underwear partner of the N.B.A., W.N.B.A. and USA Basketball.
At the time, Ms. Kardashian described the partnership as "a reflection of Skims' growing influence on culture" and said the relationship would show up in "unexpected ways." Presumably, the ad campaign is one of those. In an email, Ms. Kardashian said she had been planning the W.N.B.A. campaign since the deal was signed.
The basketball partnership followed the brand's signing on as the official underwear partner of Team USA for the Tokyo Olympics. Not long after the W.N.B.A. deal was announced, Skims unveiled a holiday campaign starring Patrick Mahomes, the quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs, and his family, all lounging around in plaid PJs.
Skims is not the only fashion (or fashion-adjacent) company to collaborate with athletes as part of a strategic play. This summer, the Paris Olympics is being sponsored in part by LVMH, the French luxury group, which has been signing up Olympians as brand ambassadors for fashion houses like Dior and Vuitton. Competition, after all, doesn't just happen on the court.

Full text: The Starz show starring Nicholas Galitzine and Julianne Moore wraps up. Three versions of the crime procedural air finales.
For those who still haven't cut the cord, here is a selection of cable and network TV shows, movies and specials that broadcast this week, May 6-12. Details and times are subject to change.
Monday
THE PARENT TRAP (1998) 8 p.m. on Freeform. With Lindsay Lohan returning to the screen in "Irish Wish," why not go back down memory lane? This movie stars Lohan as both Annie and Hallie (some flawless split-screening was involved), twins separated at birth who meet at summer camp and team up to get their divorced parents back together. One of their roadblocks is their dad's girlfriend, Meredith Blake (Elaine Hendrix), who has gone down in Y2K history as one of its chicest villains.
Tuesday
VANDERPUMP RULES REUNION 8 p.m. on Bravo. This three-part reunion, which will rehash Season 11 of "Vanderpump Rules," is a must-watch after the finale left lots of questions up in air, starting with: Is there a post-#Scandoval future for this reality show? The episode last week ended on a cliffhanger, with Ariana Madix walking out of filming after her ex boyfriend Tom Sandoval approached her at a party.
Wednesday
ROYAL RULES OF OHIO 10:30 p.m. on Freeform. On this brand-new reality show, three sisters, who claim to be descendants of Ghana royalty, try to balance day-to-day life in Columbus, Ohio, with their parents' upper-crust expectations -- shenanigans and mischief ensue. Since I blasted through all eight seasons of "Summer House" at an inappropriately fast rate, it's exciting that there is a new reality show in the mix.
Thursday
LAW & ORDER 8 p.m. on NBC. The franchise's O.G. show celebrated a milestone this season -- the penultimate episode of the season, which aired last week, was the show's 500th. Maybe now the show can set its sights on beating "General Hospital's" record: more than 15,000 episodes -- and counting.
LAW & ORDER: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT 9 p.m. on NBC. Due to the writers and actors strike, Season 25 of this show was short but still packed it's regular procedural punch. This is the season finale.
LAW & ORDER: ORGANIZED CRIME 10 p.m. on NBC. The newest baby of the franchise is wrapping up its fourth season and finding a new home. Because the show has lagged behind its older counterparts in ratings, the fifth season will be airing only on Peacock.
Friday
MARY & GEORGE 9 p.m. on Starz. If you loved Nicholas Galitzine as a swoony boy band lead in "The Idea of You," check him out in this mini-series with Julianne Moore as the Countess of Buckingham and Galitzine as her son George. Inspired by the novel "The King's Assassin" by Benjamin Woolley, the mother and son duo use sex and charm for status-climbing in 17th-century Britain.
THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA (2006) 7:06 p.m. on HBO. Now that you've watched Anne Hathaway as a dreamy single mom who falls for Galitzine's lead singer, take in one of her seminal roles. Hathaway plays Andy, a want-to-be journalist who takes a job as the assistant to Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), the icy and powerful editor in chief of Runway Magazine. If you're picturing a Anna Wintour type character and magazine similar to Vogue, you're on the right track.
Saturday
THE IRON CLAW (2023) 8 p.m. on HBO. Apparently, some people went into the theater thinking this movie was a lighthearted tale of wrestling and an excuse to admire Zac Efron but left sobbing inconsolably (OK, fine, it was me). The movie, based on the true story of Von Erich family, follows four wrestler brothers as they deal with unrelenting tragedy. It doesn't take long "to know that the wildest scenes aren't going to happen in the ring," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. "They're going to take place in the family circle."
Sunday
AMERICAN IDOL 8 p.m. on ABC. This season of the singing competition show is coming to an end, and so is the impeccable group dynamic of Lionel Richie, Luke Bryan and Katy Perry, as this is Perry's last season. The three-hour finale will feature Jon Bon Jovi mentoring the season's top three contestants as they prep for their final performance.

She's Got Legs, and Still Knows How to Use Them: [Style Desk]

Full text: Vanessa Williams's many ensembles in a music video for her new song, "Legs (Keep Dancing)," evoke her knack for portraying a diva with style.
It might not come as a surprise that Vanessa Williams, in the music video for her new single, "Legs (Keep Dancing)," can be seen showing off her legs.
Some may remember her showing off a lot more in a 1984 issue of Penthouse, that, after being published, led Ms. Williams to become the first Miss America forced to give up her crown, a decision that the pageant's leaders have since apologized for.
Her legs in the "Legs" music video, unlike in the Penthouse photos, are for the most part clothed. Moschino shorts and fishnets, a spangly gold bodysuit and a pink feathered outfit are among the many items Ms. Williams, 61, wears while moving -- mostly dancing -- between locations that include a white-walled studio, a dimly lit limousine and a nightclub.
For certain viewers, Ms. Williams's colorful wardrobe in the video might evoke other aspects of her career as an actress and singer, say, her past role as fashion editor Wilhelmina Slater in the TV show "Ugly Betty," or her upcoming role as Miranda Priestly, the Anna-Wintour-inspired fashion editor, in the musical adaptation of "The Devil Wears Prada," arriving in London's West End later this year.
Ms. Williams, speaking on a phone call on Tuesday after flying from Japan to New York, said that certain attire worn in the "Legs" video had connections to some of her past roles. For instance: A silky chartreuse corset and matching cargo pants by Adrienne Landau, a label she has worn since her days on "Ugly Betty."
Another ensemble of sheer black top and zipper-covered red pants came from Trash and Vaudeville, the punk emporium in Manhattan's East Village.
Ms. Williams, who developed her wardrobe for the video with the stylist Alison Hernon, said the clothes they chose were pieces she feels comfortable in and "that feel comfortable on my body."
She added that her outfits in the video for "Legs," her first non-holiday-related single in 15 years, were meant to not only highlight the song's titular anatomy, but also what she described as its underlying message: That her decades-long career is ongoing and ever-expanding.
"I'm still here, still standing, still kicking," Ms. Williams sings on the dance-pop single. "In fact, I'm the best I've ever been."
"I've got a lot of stuff going on," Ms. Williams said on the phone. Her to-do list includes plans to release a full-length album on a newly announced record label. She is also a producer of a new musical about the trumpeter Louis Armstrong, which is coming to Broadway around the same time she starts performances of "The Devil Wears Prada" in London.
Ms. Williams has followed a career path blazed by Black performers like Diana Ross and Diahann Carroll, both of whom also served as inspiration for "Legs" and its music video, which opens with Ms. Williams dropping a cream-colored Michael Kors coat and a Worth & Worth hat -- attire nodding to clothes Ms. Ross wore in the 1975 film "Mahogany," Ms. Hernon said.
A line in the song's chorus, "They say the legs are the last to go," echoes the title of Ms. Carroll's memoir, "The Legs Are the Last to Go," released in 2008. Its cover featured a leggy portrait of Ms. Carroll, who died in 2019.
Ms. Williams, who starred in the film "The Courage to Love" alongside Ms. Carroll, said that the title and cover of her memoir reflect how, "with age, comes wisdom."
"She's realizing and accepting her body shape and all that comes with it," Ms. Williams said. "And that's what I think is reflected in what I wanted to say with this phase of my life and also in the music."

Britain's Leader, Seemingly Out of Touch, May Soon Be Out of Office: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: After 14 years of Conservative government, Britain's voters appear hungry for change. And Prime Minister Rishi Sunak seems unable to persuade them otherwise.
A few days before Britain's Conservative Party suffered a stinging setback in local elections on Thursday, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak recorded a short video to promote some good news from his government. In the eight-second clip, Mr. Sunak poured milk from a pint bottle into a tall glass, filled with a steaming dark beverage and bearing the scribbled figure of 900 pounds on the side.
"Pay day is coming," Mr. Sunak posted, referring to the savings that an average wage earner would supposedly reap from a cut in mandatory contributions to Britain's national insurance system.
The mockery soon started. He'd added too much milk, some said. His numbers didn't add up, said others. And why, asked one critic, would Mr. Sunak choose a pint bottle as a prop days after the opposition Labour Party's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, had skewered him in Parliament as a "pint-size loser"?
However partisan her jab, loser is a label that Mr. Sunak is finding increasingly hard to shake, even among his members of his own party. In the 18 months since he replaced his failed predecessor, Liz Truss, Mr. Sunak, 43, has lost seven special parliamentary elections and back-to-back local elections.
This past week's local elections, in which the Conservatives lost about 40 percent of the 985 seats they were defending, were merely the latest signpost on what analysts say is a road to thumping defeat in a general election. National polls show the Labour Party leading the Conservatives by more than 20 percentage points, a stubborn gap that the prime minister has been unable to close.
The drumbeat of bad news is casting fresh scrutiny on Mr. Sunak's leadership and the future of his party, which has been in power for 14 years but faces what could be a long stretch in the political wilderness.
For now, Mr. Sunak appears to have quieted talks that a cabal of Conservative lawmakers would try to oust him before the vote, which is expected in the autumn. The local results, while bad, were not as catastrophic as they could have been, averting a full-fledged panic among his colleagues. Having cycled through three prime ministers since the last election, the Tories are also running out of alternative leaders.
Embattled as he is, Mr. Sunak seems likely to limp to the general election as the standard-bearer of an exhausted, divided party.
"The broader view is that it's probably better now to let Rishi stay in his post and absorb the defeat, and for successors to position themselves for what happens after Labour wins in a landslide," said Matthew Goodwin, a political scientist at the University of Kent who has advised the Conservative Party.
Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London and an expert on the Tories, said, "He does look, to be honest, like a dead man walking."
Defenders of Mr. Sunak say he is a victim of global economic headwinds coming out of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the poisoned legacy he inherited from Ms. Truss, whose sweeping tax cut plan spooked the financial markets and tarnished Britain's reputation for fiscal probity.
Britain's persistent inflation, high mortgage rates and a stagnant economy all predated Mr. Sunak. The inflation rate has dropped to 3.2 percent from 11.1 percent when he took office, though credit for that goes principally to the Bank of England.
Mr. Sunak did win praise for steadying the markets and restoring Britain's credibility after Ms. Truss. But critics said he never followed that up with a convincing strategy to recharge growth. Nor did he fulfill two other promises: to cut waiting times in the National Health Service and to stop the small boats carrying asylum seekers across the English Channel.
"Liz Truss cratered the party's reputation for economic competence," Professor Bale said. "But it's also down to Sunak: He hasn't got the grip, charisma or authority that someone doing the rescue job required would have needed."
Part of that, critics said, reflects Mr. Sunak's political shortcomings. He can be querulous in media interviews, and his attempts to connect with voters are often tin eared. He drew japes after posing in a pair of Adidas Sambas, an athletic shoe favored by celebrities like Rihanna and Harry Styles, while promoting his tax policies. "Sunak took an eternally cool sneaker, and ruined it for everyone," said British GQ magazine.
Some say that Mr. Sunak, a onetime Goldman Sachs banker whose wife, Akshata Murthy, is the daughter of an Indian technology billionaire, is simply not a relatable figure. Before he was mocked for wearing Sambas, he caught flack for wearing £490 ( $ 616) Prada suede loafers to a construction site.
The Labour Party leader, Keir Starmer, has taken aim at Mr. Sunak's preference for flying across Britain to taking the train. "I'm sure from the vantage point of his helicopter everything might look fine," Mr. Starmer said in Parliament, "but that's not the lived experience of those on the ground."
Mr. Sunak once posed with a "smart mug" for coffee, which retails for £180, on his desk -- an image that stuck in the minds of those critiquing his milk-pouring video. "If anyone can afford a £900 cup of tea, it's the prime minister," the journalist Robert Hutton wrote on social media.
Others noted that Mr. Sunak's claim that workers would save £900 in lower national insurance payments was misleading, because the government had frozen income tax thresholds. With inflation-adjusted wages, people are paying higher taxes without taking home extra money.
Mr. Sunak did not spend much time in the political trenches before becoming prime minister. He entered Parliament in 2015 and rose in just five years to be chancellor of the Exchequer under Prime Minister Boris Johnson. After helping precipitate Mr. Johnson's fall, he was beaten in his first leadership contest by Ms. Truss.
However bumpy his tenure, Mr. Sunak insists that his government has made headway on the economy, immigration and defense, with a pledge to increase Britain's military spending to 2.5 percent of economic output by 2030.
Writing in The Daily Telegraph on Saturday, Mr. Sunak drew a sharp distinction between the Tories and Labour. Voters, he said, would have a choice between "a plan versus no plan, bold principled action versus U-turns and prevarication, a clear record of delivery versus political game playing."
Nowhere has Mr. Sunak invested more political capital than on immigration. He won passage of a divisive law that would put asylum seekers on one-way flights to Rwanda, and now vows to put planes in the air by July, before the election.
The Rwanda policy, which involves permanently deporting asylum seekers without hearing their claims for asylum, is anathema to rights activists, constitutional lawyers and the courts. But it is popular with rank-and-file Conservatives -- calculated to win over the same voters in the Midlands and Northern England who turned against the Tories in the local elections.
Traditionally, these areas had been Labour strongholds, earning the nickname "red wall" after the party's campaign color. But they swung to the Tories in 2019 because of Mr. Johnson's promise to "Get Brexit Done." Now, the coalition he cobbled together appears to be fracturing; the red wall is swinging back to Labour.
Consider Blackpool South, a seaside district in the north, where Labour won a Tory-held seat in a special election on Thursday. In 2016, the wider Blackpool region had voted in favor of Brexit by 67.5 percent.
Professor Goodwin faulted the Conservatives for not moving more aggressively to cut immigration. These results, he said, "underline just how much they've lost touch with the post-Brexit political realignment."
To other analysts, however, Mr. Sunak's struggles are evidence that this realignment was always something of a mirage. In the Conservative Party's heartland in the south -- known as the "blue wall" -- voters want low taxes and stable government. Some are turned off by the anti-immigrant tone of the Rwanda policy.
These more free-market, socially liberal priorities are often at odds with what many voters in the Midlands and the North want. And that has confronted Mr. Sunak with a dilemma, the political equivalent of squaring the circle.
"He's being asked to pursue two different strategies at the same time," said Robert Hayward, a Conservative member of the House of Lords and polling expert. "Dealing with the blue wall on one side and the red wall on the other. And it's not easy to identify a common strategy that will tackle both of them."

Roomy Enough for a Retinue and a Met Gala Dress: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Famous actors, singers, athletes and housewives are fans of the Mercedes-Benz van, which has become a staple in streets outside events like the Met Gala.
When Kendall Jenner attended the 2022 Met Gala in a Prada gown with an enormous flowing skirt, getting her to the Metropolitan Museum of Art required special transportation. A limousine would not do, nor would an SUV -- walking in the dress was a challenge; sitting, impossible. The solution: Ms. Jenner would be driven, standing, in a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van.
On the way to the event, as a way to relieve her anxiety about running late, Ms. Jenner relieved herself in an ice bucket while standing in the van. "Best decision I ever made," she said of that moment in an episode of "The Kardashians" on Hulu.
The Sprinter van, a towering box on wheels with nearly six-and-a-half feet of head room, is a direct descendant of the earliest motorized caravans developed by Karl Benz in 1896. (Some 30 years later, he and Gottlieb Daimler founded the Mercedes-Benz company.) The Sprinter, first released in Europe in 1995, started being sold domestically in 2010. Last year, Mercedes-Benz unveiled an electric version.
The van -- which can be used to transport up to 15 passengers (or cargo) -- is appreciated by automotive enthusiasts for its build quality, reliability and versatility, as well as for the thrust and longevity of the diesel engine in most versions.
But other people have come to recognize the Sprinter for different reasons, among them its proximity to celebrities. The van has become a preferred mode of transportation for actors, singers, athletes and "Real Housewives," and is now a staple in streets outside star-studded events like the Oscars and the Met Gala.
The vans have become so popular as transportation to the spring gala in New York that demand for them can outstrip the local supply. "Sprinters are being brought in from Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Miami," said Etienne Haro, the general manager of the Mark Hotel on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where many Met Gala guests spend time both before and after the main event.
In recent years, between 50 and 70 guests have traveled to the gala from the Mark, with about 40to 50 of those people riding in Sprinters. Many of those vans are rented and driven by guests' personal chauffeurs. On the day of the gala, the Mark has a team of about 30 people tracking vehicles' locations to ensure their passengers arrive punctually, Mr. Haro said.
Sprinter riders often take advantage of the van's roomy interior to ensure they also arrive looking flawless. "The entourage, glam team, stylist -- everyone can hop in to put on the finishing touches," Mr. Haro said.
But occasionally, he added, some Sprinter passengers have hit bumps in the road on their way to and from the gala.
"Getting out of a Sprinter with a voluminous gown and high heels can be challenging," Mr. Haro said, noting one instance in which a Mark employee caught a Met Gala guest "in midair" as she was falling out of a van. He recalled another guest "whose dress was so intricate that she could not enter her vehicle."
Though it bears Mercedes-Benz's three-point-star logo, the Sprinter has an otherwise innocuous exterior that, for some famous fans, has as much appeal as its capacious interior.
"Our clients say, 'The paparazzi are chasing us around; we don't want to be in something that's sticking out like a sore thumb, like a Rolls or a Bentley," said Howard Becker, the founder of Becker Automotive Design in Southern California, which has customized Sprinter vans and other vehicles for people like the director Steven Spielberg, the actor Mark Wahlberg and the television host Steve Harvey.
"The Sprinter kind of fades in," said Mr. Becker, 75.
The starting price for a diesel-engine van is about $ 50,000; electric Sprinters start at about $ 72,000. But models outfitted by Mr. Becker or by Gabi Mashal, whose Southern California company Bespoke Coach also customizes the vans, typically cost between $ 350,000 and $ 450,000.
Their distinctive features can include temperature-controlled, lie-flat seats with built-in massagers, secure internet routers, state-of-the-art stereo and video systems and onboard bathrooms for their owners.
"These people can't use a public restroom," said Mr. Mashal, 60, who has customized vans for the singer Mark Anthony and the boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr.
The Sprinter's size and luxurious reputation are reasons it has replaced vehicles like limousines and SUVs as the rental transportation of choice on many versions of "The Real Housewives," said Nate Green, an executive producer of "The Real Housewives of Miami." He described the Sprinter as a friend of the "Housewives," using a term given to supporting characters in the franchise who appear regularly in episodes.
Mr. Green said his show's crew also favors Sprinters because the van's cabin has enough room for camera operators to stand -- and to film from several angles.
"This is really important," Mr. Green said, "because 'Housewives' is sometimes more about the reaction than about the actual dialogue."
Throughout the reality TV franchise's 18 years on Bravo, Sprinter vans have been a place where housewives have drunkenly fallen down, signed divorce papers, passionately kissed co-stars, engaged in verbal spats and been approached by officers with the Department of Homeland Security.
"When people see a Sprinter van, they know that there's going to be something that happens that's going to be iconic," said Lisa Shannon, an executive producer of the New York and Salt Lake City installments of "The Real Housewives," as well as its "Ultimate Girls Trip" spinoff.
The Sprinter, while strongly associated with the "Housewives" franchise, has appeared in more than 4,000 movies and TV episodes. Like many tokens of pop culture, it has been imitated on "The Simpsons," and it recently joined one of cinema's most distinguishable automotive fleets: the vehicles in "Ghostbusters."
In the series's latest film, "Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire," released in March, a new van called Ecto-Z -- a black Sprinter outfitted with racks for proton packs -- is featured alongside the tail-finned 1959 Cadillac ambulance known to many as the Ecto-1.
Eric Reich, an executive producer of "Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire," said a Sprinter was chosen for the Ecto-Z role after Mercedes-Benz and Sony, the film's distributor, had meetings to discuss product placement. He added that a Sprinter, like a Cadillac, made sense for transporting the Ghostbusters and their gear because both vehicles blend "luxury and function."
That amalgamation has also made Sprinters popular among so-called vanlifers -- people known for cavorting, traveling and sleeping in customized vans. Many of them document their lifestyles online, including Peter Holcombe, 51, who has spent much of the last decade living with his wife, Kathy, 50, and daughter, Abby, 19, in four Sprinter vans outfitted by the motor-home company Winnebago. (The Holcombes are brand ambassadors for Mercedes-Benz and Winnebago; they bought three of their vans at a discount.)
In their vans, the family has visited all 50 states, several national parks and 19 European countries. (Last year, Abby moved out of the family vehicle and into one of her own.) The Holcombes are currently driving what's known as the Pan-American Highway, a network of roads that runs from Alaska to the southern tip of South America.
"We've done over 400,000 miles in Sprinters," Mr. Holcombe said.
Wes Siler, a backcountry camper and a columnist for Outside magazine in Bozeman, Mont., is less of a fan.
Mr. Siler, 43, who camps out of a converted pickup truck, said the cost of buying and customizing a Sprinter for outdoor exploring is excessive for what he described as little more than a "poseur backdrop."
"They're cool on Instagram," he said. "That's, like, the entire story."
But even Mr. Siler, who grew up in Europe, recognizes that the van has a certain appeal. He recalled getting to prom at his high school in London in a Sprinter that had been outfitted as a party bus.
"You couldn't want a better limo," he said.

He's Young and Famous. Is That So Wrong?: [Review]

Full text: Anne Hathaway headlines a movie that's got a lot to say about the perils of fame.
Women of a certain age (that is, my age) feel like they grew up alongside Anne Hathaway, because, well, we did. We were awkward teens together when she made "The Princess Diaries" in 2001. We felt ourselves to be put-upon entry-level hirelings right when "The Devil Wears Prada" came out in 2006. We understood her broken-down narcissistic addict in "Rachel Getting Married," because who couldn't? And we watched the Hathaway backlash, pegged to public perception that she was trying too hard, and worried that people saw us the same way.
Now we're 40-ish. We know for sure that Gen Z considers millennials to be cringe, and, thankfully, we no longer feel the need to care. The greatest gift of reaching middle age is having settled into yourself, and that is apparently what Hathaway, age 41, has done. She has been through the celebrity wringer (and more) and come out the other side looking radiant, with a long list of credits in movies that swing from standard commercial fare to auteurist masterpieces.
This is perhaps why it's so satisfying to see her name come first -- alone, before the title credit -- in "The Idea of You," which is on its surface a relatively fluffy little film. Based on the sleeper hit novel by Robinne Lee, "The Idea of You" is plainly fantasy, in the fan fiction mold, that poses the question: What if Harry Styles, the British megastar and former frontman of One Direction, fell madly in love with a hot 40-year-old mom? In this universe, the Styles character is Hayes Campbell (Nicholas Galitzine), the British frontman of a five-member boy band called August Moon.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Hathaway plays Solène Marchand, an art gallery owner whose arrogantly useless ex-husband, Daniel (Reid Scott), buys v.i.p. meet-and-greet tickets for their 16-year-old daughter, Izzy (Ella Rubin), and her two best friends, all of whom were huge August Moon fans ... in the seventh grade.
The event is at Coachella, and Daniel is set to take the teenagers but backs out at the last second, citing a work emergency. Solène reluctantly agrees to take them, and while at the festival, mistakes Hayes's trailer for the bathroom. They meet, it's cute, and you can guess what happens next.
Or can you? It was clear about 10 minutes into the movie that what was required for enjoyment was to surrender to the daydreaming, and so, with very little internal protest, I did. How could I resist? Solène is smart, competent, kind and secure; she has great hair and a great wardrobe; and most important, she seems like a real person, even if the situation in which she finds herself greatly stretches the bonds of credibility.
More than once, I was struck by how authentically 40 Solène seemed to me -- a woman capable of making her own decisions, even ones she thinks might be ill-advised -- and how weirdly rare it is to see that kind of character in a movie. She has a kid, and friends, and a career. She reads books and looks at art, and she is flattered by this 24-year-old superstar's attention but takes a long time to come around to the idea that it may not be a joke.
Solène also feels real shame and real resolve in the course of the winding fairy tale story, which predictably has to go south. But most of all, she's in a movie that doesn't try to shame her, or patronize her, or make her appear ridiculous for having desires and fantasies of her own. She's just who she is, and it's simple to understand her appeal to someone whose life has never been his own.
Directed by Michael Showalter, who wrote the adapted screenplay with Jennifer Westfeldt, "The Idea of You" succeeds mostly because of Hathaway's performance, though she and Galitzine spark and banter pleasurably (and he can dance and sing, too). It tweaks the novel in a number of ways -- Hayes is older than the book's character, for one thing -- and also seems to implicitly know it's a movie, and that movies have a strange relationship with age-gap romances.
In fact, that's one of its strengths. Several times, characters remark on the double standard attached to people's judgment of Solène and Hayes's relationship, hypothesizing that in a gender-swapped situation, people would be high-fiving the older man who landed the hot younger star. Sixteen years looks like a lot on paper, but in the movies, at least, it is barely a blip.
That musing is interesting enough, if a familiar one. More fascinating in "The Idea of You" is its treatment of the cage of celebrity. Hayes seems mature compared with his bandmates and the girls who follow them around, but he's also clearly stuck in some kind of arrested development. And I do mean stuck: He is self-aware enough to tell Solène, plaintively, that he auditioned for the band when he was 14 and not much has changed beyond his level of fame. He wants a life beyond the spotlight, badly.
And that's just what he can't get. Neither can Solène, nor, eventually, anyone around her. The idea of living a quiet life might obviously be out of reach, but the added elements of tabloid news and rabid fans unafraid to treat Hayes as if they know him make things far worse. The film starts to feel a little like the tale of a monster, but the monster is parasociality, encouraged by the illusion of intimacy that the modern superstar machine relies on to keep selling tickets and merch and albums and whatever else keeps the star in the spotlight.
It's probably coincidental that "The Idea of You" comes on the heels of Taylor Swift's latest album, "The Tortured Poets Department," on which she strongly implies that her carefully cultivated fandom has made her love life a nightmare. But spiritually, at least, they're of a piece -- even if the origins of the film's plot seem as much borne of parasociality as a critique of it. And that makes Hathaway's performance extra poignant. She's been dragged into that buzz saw before. And somehow, she's figured out how to make a life on the other side of it.
The Idea of You
Rated R for getting hot and heavy, plus some language. Running time: 1 hour 55 minutes. Watch on Prime Video.

Preserving Black History, on T-Shirts: [Style Desk]

Full text: Not long after Tremaine Emory resigned his position as Supreme's creative director last summer, he came across an image of an old hoodie from the brand emblazoned with one of its familiar biting slogans: "Illegal business controls America."
The hoodie is part of the Supreme canon, an embodiment of its middle-finger approach to appropriation, with its use of the signature Futura font lifted from Barbara Kruger; and its flirtation with hip-hop radicalism -- the phrase comes from a Boogie Down Productions song.
With his fraught tenure at Supreme in the rear view, Mr. Emory began to see the hoodie in a different light. He'd been hired as its first Black creative director, but his tenure lasted less than a year and a half. He left the company citing structural racism in its ranks, in part spurred by how the company bungled a collaboration he'd secured with the firebrand artist Arthur Jafa.
Supreme, the foundational skate brand founded by James Jebbia, turns 30 this year, which means that it has been around long enough to sow the seeds of its own resistance.
"I respect the legacy," Mr. Emory said. "That doesn't mean I can't question it."
And so this week, as part of his own brand Denim Tears, Mr. Emory is releasing collaborative pieces with Mr. Jafa very similar to the ones that Supreme ultimately declined to release, owing to their raw and provocative commentary on Black trauma. And he remade the signature hoodie, in the original colors, using the same visual language and cheeky audacity but broadcasting a different message: "Systemic racism controls America."
It's a nod and a nudge. A wink and a slammed door. The Denim Tears-Jafa collaboration is, Mr. Emory said, "a dance between ideologies. This whole situation between me and James Jebbia and the Supreme C-suite helped result in this piece of fashion, art and design."
It's also a bristling and timely example of how Mr. Emory has, for the past few years, built upon familiar, almost taken-for-granted streetwear vehicles, imbuing them with layered and often unearthed meaning, centering and amplifying Black stories and perspectives that are often alluded to in this sector of the clothing world but rarely deeply explored.
Denim Tears, which began in 2019 as a fashion-art hybrid project, is at the forefront of a handful of rising post-Supreme streetwear concerns -- Awake NY, Barriers and Born X Raised among them -- not owned and operated by white people. It has been able to scale quickly thanks to collaborations with Levi's, Converse, Our Legacy and Dior, and its Pan-African flag tweaks on Ralph Lauren designs of the 1990s. But it remains a nimble business, with a different approach to commercial risk than the more established brands that have turned streetwear into a multibillion-dollar industry and which often strategically utilize Black expression as an accent of cool.
Being a key part of this generational change in streetwear has put Mr. Emory in cross hairs at almost every turn, as a symbol of both transformation and representation. At Supreme, he found an insufficiently diverse staff who treated discourse about race like "pushing food around the plate. They didn't want to eat the vegetables," he said. The Jafa images he'd wanted to put on Supreme clothes and skateboards, which included depictions of lynching and the lash marks on the back of a former slave, caused discomfort internally and externally. And while leaving Supreme freed Mr. Emory to devote all of his work time to Denim Tears, his current collection, which takes visual inspiration from Black Southern food culture, has been met with online resistance.
All the while, he has been recovering from an October 2022 aortic aneurysm that landed him in the hospital for two-and-a-half months, and happened around the same time he was being attacked on social media by Ye (f.k.a. Kanye West), his former employer, for daring to publicly denounce his White Lives Matter-era antics. For Mr. Emory, whose natural disposition tends to the ruminative and patient, and who for much of the 2010s played creative consort to Mr. West and Frank Ocean, among others, while coming into his own as a clothing designer following the path laid out by his close friend Virgil Abloh, the attention has been dizzying and disorienting, though not quite destabilizing.
"It's purgatory, 'cause you can't do what you want to do as a Black man in America," he said in early March of these tugs of war about who can steer Black storytelling in fashion, and to where. "You're working with the confines of what white culture at large wants you to do, and also what Black culture at large expects of you."
Rather than shy away from the hard conversations, though, Mr. Emory is leaning in. He was speaking at the still-spartan Denim Tears office on West Broadway in Manhattan, around the corner from his first permanent retail space, African Diaspora Goods, which sells his brand alongside a collection of 2,000 African art history books, which will eventually function as a kind of non-lending research library.
Denim Tears is currently best known for the cotton wreath motif that Mr. Emory began applying to vintage Levi's jeans in 2020 -- originally as a limited release that felt more like an artistic than sartorial intervention, and subsequently much more widely on jeans and caps and sweatsuits. The goal was discursive, to highlight the product of slave labor and make it manifest on the product itself. In the last year especially, the wreath has become one of the most recognizable, ubiquitous and now widely bootlegged logos in streetwear.
"That means that discourse spreads," Mr. Emory said.
Part of Mr. Emory's influence and power comes from how he brings these reference points into quotidian, easy-to-wear garments like jeans, hoodies and T-shirts. "It's a beautifully utilitarian approach," said the fashion designer Andre Walker, a close friend of Mr. Emory's.
The title of the current Denim Tears collection is Kiss My Grits -- what his mother (and many others in the South) used to say as a proxy for "kiss my Black ass." Black food references thread the collection together across disparate design frameworks. The clothes include abstraction (a silk velour shirt and pants in the colors of the spices used to make fried chicken), pop art (watermelon wallets, green rind on the outside and red, seed-filled meat on the inside, made with Comme des Garçons); and baroque painting (a hoodie with a still life of various fruits). There are shirts done in a picnic-tablecloth pattern and necklaces made of chicken bones sealed in resin.
Mr. Emory's use of this imagery walks a "beautiful tightrope of subtlety and obviousness," Mr. Walker said.
These signifiers are drawn directly from Mr. Emory's upbringing spending summers in rural Harlem, Ga. -- the breakfast table at his mother's home or his grandfather's truck filled with watermelons (or his father's stories of getting shot at by white farmers for stealing watermelons).
"That's who I come from," he said. "You know what I mean? So I don't feel shame about no watermelon. It's a part of my culture," Mr. Emory said. "The same type of white folk that burnt down Tulsa, they turned that into a racial trope. And I'm not going for that."
The chicken bones that are made into necklaces? They reference bone-throwing divination rituals, and also refer to how a young Mr. Emory would watch his father crack bones and suck out the marrow. It's also a nod to Vivienne Westwood and the Let It Rock boutique, which sold clothes with chicken bones attached.
For Mr. Emory, though, the clothes are part of a long pattern of embedding personal narrative into his designs. The dusty red of an Asics collaboration he released in 2021 referred to the clay of Mr. Emory's family funeral plot in Georgia. One of his earliest T-shirts, which he sold at pop-ups in New York, prominently featured a photo of his mother, who died in 2015. (And Mr. Emory has used Black cuisine as a trope before: The collection he released with Dior in 2022 featured a collard green motif.)
This time around, however, some of the online chatter from Black critics has been unsparing. "Part of why it's polarizing is because people don't see me as an artist," Mr. Emory said. He sees his clothing in a tradition that includes David Hammons's 1970s artworks that used spades, Kara Walker's "A Subtlety," the Sphinx-esque installation at the Domino Sugar Factory in 2014; and Spike Lee's film "Bamboozled."
"If people think I'm on some Stepin Fetchit, Black Sambo," Mr. Emory said, "you're really not paying attention."
He added, "I'm making a pawn a king."
Mr. Emory refers to these online critics as "the loud minority." "If it was the loud majority, I wouldn't be sitting here," he said. "I wouldn't be able to pay my staff. I wouldn't be able to open a store. I wouldn't be able to pay my expensive-ass health insurance."
He has also been attacked for marrying a white woman. "I've been made fun of for dating a Black girl with natural hair, and I've lived long enough to be made fun of for marrying a white woman. I've seen both sides," he noted, with a rare flash of exasperation. "James Baldwin dated white men and he's the most prolific, most quoted Black thinker to ever live."
Andee Emory McConnell, who Mr. Emory married in October, has watched him navigate the critiques up close. "It's his soul coming out into the form of the pieces that he chooses to put out into the public," she said. "And when someone comes for your soul, how can you not take that to heart?"
The Road to Recovery
Much of the conversation about Mr. Emory and his work mirrors the discourse about Mr. Abloh -- alternately dragged and praised, sometimes by the same people -- in the final years before his death in 2021. Mr. Abloh was the most visible Black designer in men's fashion, and his success opened up doors for a younger generation, but the persistent and often persnickety meta-narrative about his work was draining. That Mr. Emory is experiencing similar pushback during a period of time where he is still navigating his medical recovery -- much as Mr. Abloh was, largely in secret -- isn't lost on him.
He was hospitalized for the aortic dissection eight months into his time at Supreme, a near-death experience that led to two induced comas, a fasciotomy on his left leg, pneumonia, blood sepsis, kidney failure and dialysis -- all in the span of just a few weeks.
Mr. Jafa visited him in the hospital. "I said, 'It's not your time,"' he said. "You're supposed to be here. We are not supposed to lose you the way we lost Virgil. You got more that you're supposed to do."
When Mr. Emory got home from the hospital, he couldn't sleep with covers on, because the nerves in his legs were too sensitive. He left the hospital in a wheelchair, eventually graduated to a walker, and now walks slowly and deliberately, aided by a hiking stick. For shoes, he wears only Hokas, apart from the rare night out. Three times a week, in the sleek, minimalist, book-filled TriBeCa loft he and Ms. McConnell share, his physical therapist arrives for a private session.
Not all the hurt is physical, though. Mr. Abloh's passing left a talent vacuum. "Because certain other people aren't here," Mr. Emory said grimly, "the target's on my back."
Mr. Emory's close relationship with Mr. Abloh informed his development as a clothing designer. "V is the first person in my adult life who was like, 'You're an artist,"' he recalled. When Mr. Emory first showed him the image of the wreaths, Mr. Abloh said: "This is beautiful. Six months, you gonna have a Maybach."
Mr. Emory laughed a little. "So I'm making good," he said. "I didn't buy the Maybach. I did this store."
That store opened last month in the old Union space on Spring Street in SoHo, one of the foundational addresses in New York streetwear history. (In a rich coincidence, Mr. Jebbia was a founder of Union.)
The space was wholly redesigned by the artist Theaster Gates in an update of a design he'd first displayed at a 2019 exhibition at Regen Projects in Los Angeles in preparation for collaborating with Mr. Abloh on a possible store.
On the right wall, made of torched plywood over a steel frame, are Denim Tears clothes, hanging face out on lengths of pipe. On the left wall is the African art-book collection, which Mr. Emory bought for $ 150,000 from Arcana Books in Los Angeles, works its owners collected over four decades.
"A site of Black possibility" Mr. Gates called the shop. "We didn't have the burden of the whole space being a retail store. It was like, 'What if people came in and they were a little bit confused about what was happening here?"'
Productive confusion is Mr. Emory's métier, and both his falling out with Supreme and the recent Denim Tears blowback turn in part on how the Black experience should be captured on clothing, especially clothing that may be bought and worn and displayed out in the world by people who haven't lived that experience. Or, as one TikToker put it, "Can white people wear Denim Tears?"
For the record, Mr. Emory's answer is yes: "If I see a little white kid wearing it, I'm like, fire. I wonder what the conversation is up in his crib. Maybe the conversation's beautiful and the dad's like, where'd you get that shirt? Can we look it up?" Or perhaps it goes another, equally revealing way: "Maybe the kid gets into an argument and realizes that even though he loves his dad, his dad's a racist. And maybe the kid's like, I never want to be like this part of him. Maybe that happened because of that conversation about the T-shirt."
These are some of Mr. Emory's crucial questions: Is there a distinction between a gallery and a T-shirt? How vast is the chasm between style and art? Are some images too unsettling to put on clothes? And should images that are so unsettling be looked at even more intently?
A Desire for Discourse About the Past and Present
"I think the reality is that Tremaine craves discourse," said Anthony Specter, Mr. Emory's close friend of more than a decade and business partner in Denim Tears. "Tremaine's exit from Supreme, a lot of that revolved around the fact that there was no discourse. It wasn't about someone attacking his idea. The most stressful part for him, the part that made him realize he couldn't do his job, was that he wasn't able to talk about it."
Mr. Emory received the Supreme offer the week of Mr. Abloh's death and began the job in February 2022. Mr. Abloh, he said, had warned him not to take it: "He said: 'What would it take for you to culturally move that brand? Do you really want to extend that energy?' And boy was my brother right."
Mr. Emory had long been in the social orbit of Supreme, a now-big company -- acquired by VF Corporation in 2020 for more than $ 2 billion -- that still functions like a private party. His tenure there lasted only about 13 months, not counting the five and a half months he was on medical leave.
Despite having hired Mr. Emory as creative director -- the first time the insular company had hired someone with that title -- Mr. Jebbia remained a hovering presence, Mr. Emory said. Not long before Mr. Emory's hospitalization, he and Mr. Jebbia had a face-off in a meeting over control.
"I had to really put my foot down with James," Mr. Emory recalled. "I said, 'Are we Miuccia and Raf? Because I wasn't hired under that pretext. I was hired as you were stepping back."' (Miuccia Prada hired Raf Simons as a co-creative director of Prada in 2020.)
Through a representative, Supreme declined to comment.
In creative meetings, Mr. Emory would sometimes be told a project he suggested, or had done at Denim Tears, was admirable but couldn't work at Supreme. But Supreme has deployed the patina of Black radicalism previously, whether images of Martin Luther King Jr. or a Black hand extending a middle finger on T-shirts in collaboration with the hip-hop duo Dead Prez. It has featured umpteen rappers on shirts and played with imagery far less radical, like the presidential headshot of Barack Obama. It has also showcased provocative art, like Andres Serrano's "Piss Christ."
But Mr. Emory found those engagements to be surface level: If the staff was unable to truly talk about the complexities of Black life and culture, then "why are you touching it at all?" he wondered.
Mr. Emory realized he hadn't been brought in as a change agent. He recalled a meeting about whether to release a shirt featuring the controversial young rap superstar YoungBoy Never Broke Again, in which concerns about his criminal history were being weighed against his popularity on streaming services and among young people. The project was approved.
Mr. Emory recalls Mr. Jafa saying, "Does James listen to NBA YoungBoy?" Mr. Emory continued: "He wasn't trolling James. What he was saying is, 'If you listen to it, the lyrics are dark. The darkness isn't far removed from how dark my work is.' That's what AJ was saying. Like, do they not see if you could do NBA YoungBoy, you can do me?"
Mr. Jafa had been one of Mr. Emory's first calls when he arrived at Supreme. When Mr. Emory was still working for Mr. West, he'd brokered a meeting with Mr. Jafa, who'd used Mr. West's music in his breakout 2016 video work "Love Is the Message, The Message Is Death"
For Supreme, they planned to collaborate on items using some of Mr. Jafa's rawest imagery: including "LeRage," featuring a Hulk-esque character depicted with hyperbolized cartoon art to underscore Black frustration; and "Ex-Slave Gordon," an image of a free Black man showing the scars from whippings he'd suffered while in bondage.
"People always think if you are a Black visual artist, that your stuff is supposed to be in some ways relatable or palatable -- I call it after-school special," Mr. Jafa said. "I do what I want to do. I'm not interested in white folks telling me what to do. But neither am I interested in Black people telling me what to do."
The clothing went through the usual channels for collaborations. Samples were produced. And then, silence. After a junior-level Black employee complained to Mr. Jebbia about the imagery, saying it belonged in a museum, not a skate shop, the collaboration was effectively shelved. No one spoke with Mr. Emory about the collaboration's fate.
During a meeting discussing the work of the Black artist Lauren Halsey, Mr. Emory said he didn't want to discuss working with Black artists until getting clarity about the Jafa collaboration. Soon after, he received a call from human resources, he said, saying they'd received a complaint that the meeting had been "emotional and racially charged."
After his resignation, Mr. Emory and Mr. Jebbia had a frank and vulnerable four-hour conversation at Mr. Emory's home. Mr. Emory said that Mr. Jebbia said that the reason he never talked to him about the Jafa collaboration, was "cause he knew I would change his mind." At one point, Mr. Emory said, Mr. Jebbia had tears in his eyes.
"I'll always respect him because he did things wrong in my opinion, but he looked me in my eyes and talked to me like a grown adult," Mr. Emory said. "He apologized to my face. And he's the only person in the company that did that."
But after the Business of Fashion published an account of Mr. Emory's exit framed in a way he found disingenuous, "I texted James just a picture of the 'White Fragility' book. I said, 'I hope one day you read this book so you can really understand where I'm coming from. I don't know if me and you will ever speak again. But regardless if we do, I hope you read this book."' (Ms. McConnell, who had worked at Supreme as well, quit after that article's release.)
In that same conversation, Mr. Emory said Mr. Jebbia expressed hope that Mr. Emory would consider returning to the position, but Mr. Emory declined.
"People, in interfacing with Tremaine, treat him with love and excitement and exuberance," Ms. McConnell said. "And I think that maybe he's learned, which could also probably be a little heartbreaking, that sometimes there's things under that he needs to pay attention to."
Mr. Emory concurred. "You're hiring a guy that does Black Jesus with the cotton wreath on his head as your creative director. I felt like, 'You're a real one,"' he said. "And to have it go down like this, it makes me feel like I was wrong."
Asked whether he'd consider taking a creative director role at another white-owned fashion brand, Mr. Emory wrestled with the question in both micro and macro form.
"If the people didn't value Virgil being at Louis more than Off-White, maybe he wouldn't have took the job," he said.
"Hubris is a hell of a drug," he continued. "I can be honest and say I work steadfastly on my validation index and focus on only finding validation from seeing a kid of any color wearing DT in the streets. But I don't know. I don't want to cap you down, man. I don't know."
For now, the freedom of Denim Tears is what soothes and sates Mr. Emory, whether it's his ability to release the Jafa collaboration with no pushback -- "Are we supposed to hide these scars and never look at these scars again?" -- or his coming collection themed around Black jockeys, whose hidden history Mr. Emory's father taught him about.
"Some people don't give me grace that maybe I'm thinking hard," he said, more resigned and frustrated than angry.
Ultimately, Mr. Emory and his critics agree that no version of the Black experience is universal. "My view is I can't tell another Black person how to feel about their Black experience, because Black people aren't a monolith," he said, acknowledging that the uncomfortable discourse is, in many ways, key to his creative project.
"They have the right to unfollow me. They have the right to leave a comment. They have a right to not buy it, tell other people not to buy it. But what they can't do is change what I'm gonna do."

Full text: Every art institution now speaks of progress, justice, transformation. What if all those words hide a more old-fashioned aim?
There is a sour tendency in cultural politics today -- a growing gap between speaking about the world and acting in it.
In the domain of rhetoric, everyone has grown gifted at pulling back the curtain. An elegant museum gallery is actually a record of imperial violence; a symphony orchestra is a site of elitism and exploitation: these critiques we can now deliver without trying. But when it comes to making anything new, we are gripped by near-total inertia. We are losing faith with so many institutions of culture and society -- the museum, the market, and, especially this week, the university -- but cannot imagine an exit from them. We throw bricks with abandon, we lay them with difficulty, if at all. We engage in perpetual protest, but seem unable to channel it into anything concrete.
So we spin around. We circle. And, maybe, we start going backward.
I've just spent a week tramping across Venice, a city of more than 250 churches, and where did I encounter the most doctrinaire catechism? It was in the galleries of the 2024 Venice Biennale, still the world's principal appointment to discover new art, whose current edition is at best a missed opportunity, and at worst something like a tragedy.
It's often preachy, but that's not its biggest problem. The real problem is how it tokenizes, essentializes, minimizes and pigeonholes talented artists -- and there are many here, among more than 300 participants -- who have had their work sanded down to slogans and lessons so clear they could fit in a curator's screenshot. This is a Biennale that speaks the language of assurance, but is actually soaked in anxiety, and too often resorts, as the Nigerian author Wole Soyinka deplored in a poem, to "cast the sanctimonious stone / And leave frail beauty shredded in the square / Of public shame."
This year's Biennale opened last week under an ominous star. The Venetian megashow consists of a central exhibition, spanning two locations, as well as around 90 independent pavilions organized by individual nations. One of these nations is Israel, and in the weeks before the vernissage an activist group calling itself the "Art Not Genocide Alliance" had petitioned the show's organizers to exclude Israel from participating. The Biennale refused; a smaller appeal against the pavilion of Iran also went nowhere. (As for Russia, it remains nation non grata for the second Biennale in a row.) With disagreements over the war in Gaza spilling into cultural institutions across the continent -- they'd already sunk Documenta, the German exhibition that is Venice's only rival for attendance and prestige -- the promise of a major controversy seemed to hang over the Giardini della Biennale.
As it happened, the artist and curator of Israel's pavilion surprised the preview audience by closing their own show, and posted a sign at the entrance declaring it would stay shut until "a cease-fire and hostage release agreement is reached." A small protest took place anyway ("No Death in Venice" was one slogan), but the controversy had only a tiny impact on the Prosecco-soaked Venetian carnival that is opening week. Right next door, at the U.S. Pavilion, twice as many visitors were waiting to get inside as were protesting.
One could strain to read the Israeli withdrawal productively, as part of a century-long tradition of empty, vacated or closed exhibitions by artists such as Rirkrit Tiravanija, Graciela Carnevale, and all the way back to Marcel Duchamp. Probably it was the only possible response to an untenable situation. Either way, the Israel pavilion encapsulated in miniature a larger dilemma and deficiency, in Venice and in culture more broadly: a thoroughgoing inability -- even Foucault did not go this far! -- to think about art, or indeed life, as anything other than a reflection of political, social or economic power.
That is certainly the agenda of the central exhibition, organized by the Brazilian museum director Adriano Pedrosa. I'd cheered when he was appointed curator of this year's edition. At the São Paulo Museum of Art, one of Latin America's boldest cultural institutions, Pedrosa had masterminded a cycle of centuries-spanning exhibitions that reframed Brazilian art as a crucible of African, Indigenous, European and pan-American history. His nomination came a few weeks after Giorgia Meloni became Italy's first far-right prime minister since World War II. And Pedrosa -- who had successfully steered his museum through Brazil's own far-right presidency of 2018-22 -- promised a show of cosmopolitanism and variety, as expressed in a title, "Foreigners Everywhere," that seemed like a moderate anti-Meloni dig.
But what Pedrosa has actually brought to Venice is a closed, controlled, and at times belittling showcase, which smooths out all the distinctions and contradictions of a global commons. The show is remarkably placid, especially in the Giardini. There are large doses of figurative painting and (as customary these days) weaving and tapestry arranged in polite, symmetrical arrays. There is art of great beauty and power, such as three cosmological panoramas by the self-taught Amazonian painter Santiago Yahuarcani, and also far less sophisticated work celebrated by the curator in the exact same way.
In the brutal rounding-down arithmetic of the 2024 Venice Biennale, to be a straniero -- a "foreigner" or "stranger," applied equally to graduates of the world's most prestigious M.F.A. programs and the mentally ill -- implies moral credibility, and moral credibility equals artistic importance. Hence Pedrosa's inclusion of L.G.B.T.Q. people as "foreigners," as if gender or sexuality were proof of progressive bona fides. (Gay men have led far-right parties in the Netherlands and Austria; over at Venice's Peggy Guggenheim Collection is a wonderfully pervy show of the polymathic Frenchman Jean Cocteau, who praised Nazis while drawing sailors without their bell-bottoms.)
Even more bizarre is the designation of the Indigenous peoples of Brazil and Mexico, of Australia and New Zealand, as "foreigners"; surely they should be the one class of people exempt from such estrangement. In some galleries, categories and classifications take precedence over formal sophistication to a derogatory degree. The Pakistan-born artist Salman Toor, who paints ambiguous scenes of queer New York with real acuity and invention, is shown alongside simplistic queer-and-trans-friendly street art from an Indian NGO "spreading positivity and hope to their communities."
Over and over, the human complexity of artists gets upstaged by their designation as group members, and art itself gets reduced to a symptom or a triviality. I felt that particularly in three large, shocking galleries in the central pavilion of the Giardini, packed tight with more than 100 paintings and sculptures made in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East between 1915 and 1990. These constitute the bulk of what Pedrosa calls the show's nucleo storico, its historical core, and this was the part of the Biennale I'd looked forward to most. It had promised to demonstrate that the world outside the North Atlantic has a history of modern art far richer than our leading museums have shown us.
Indeed it does. But you won't learn that here, where paintings of wildly different importance and quality have been shoved together with almost no historical documentation, cultural context, or even visual delight. It flushes away distinctions between free and unfree regimes or between capitalist and socialist societies, or between those who joined an international avant-garde and those who saw art as a nationalist calling. True pioneers, such as the immense Brazilian innovator Tarsila do Amaral, are equated with orthodox or traditionalist portraitists. More ambitious exhibitions -- notably the giant "Postwar," staged in Munich in 2016-17 -- used critical juxtaposition and historical documentation to show how and why an Asian modernism, or an African modernism, looked the way it did. Here in Venice, Pedrosa treats paintings from all over as just so many postage stamps, pasted down with little visual acuity, celebrated merely for their rarity to an implied "Western" viewer.
You thought we were all equals? Here you have the logic of the old-style ethnological museum, transposed from the colonial exposition to the Google Images results page. S.H. Raza of India, Saloua Raouda Choucair of Lebanon, the Cuban American Carmen Herrera, and also painters who were new to me, got reduced to so much Global South wallpaper, and were photographed by visitors accordingly. All of which shows that it's far too easy to speak art's exculpatory language, to invoke "opacity" or "fugitivity" or whatever today's decolonial shibboleth may be. But by othering some 95 percent of humanity -- by designating just about everyone on earth as "foreigners," and affixing categories onto them with sticky-backed labels -- what you really do is exactly what those dreadful Europeans did before you: you exoticize.
And yet, for all that, there is so much I liked in this year's Biennale! From the central exhibition I am still thinking about a monumental installation of unfired coils of clay by Anna Maria Maiolino, a winner of the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement, that recasts serial production as something intimate, irregular, even anatomical. Karimah Ashadu, who won the Silver Lion for her high-speed film of young men bombing across Lagos on banned motorbikes, gave the economic intensity of megacity life a vigorous visual language. There are the stark, speechless paintings from the 1970s of Romany Eveleigh, whose thousands of scratched little O's turn writing into an unsemantic howl. There are Yuko Mohri's mischievously articulated assemblages of found objects, plastic sheeting and fresh fruit, in the Japanese Pavilion, and Precious Okoyomon's Gesamtkunstwerk of soil, speakers and motion sensors, in the Nigerian Pavilion.
Beyond the Biennale, Christoph Büchel's frenzied exhibition at the Fondazione Prada assembles mountains of junk and jewels into an impertinent exposé of wealth and debt, colonialism and collecting. In the Palazzo Contarini Polignac, a hazily elegant video by the Odesa-born artist Nikolay Karabinovych reinscribes the Ukrainian landscape as a crossroads of languages, religions and histories. Above all there is Pierre Huyghe, at the Punta della Dogana, who fuses human intelligence and artificial intelligence into the rarest thing of all: an image we have never seen before.
What all these artists have in common is some creative surplus that cannot be exploited -- not for a nation's image, not for a curator's thesis, not for a collector's vanity. Rather than the sudsy "politics" of advocacy, they profess that art's true political value lies in how it exceeds rhetorical function or financial value, and thereby points to human freedom. They are the ones who offered me at least a glimpse of what an equitable global cultural assembly could be: an "anti-museum," in the phrase of the Cameroonian philosopher Achille Mbembe, where "the exhibiting of subjugated or humiliated humanities" at last becomes a venue where everyone gets to be more than a representative.
I still, unfashionably, keep faith with Mbembe's dream institution, and the artists here who would have their place in it. But we won't build it with buzzwords alone, and if anyone had actually been paying attention to the political discourse in this part of the world in a time of war, they would have realized that two can play this game. "An essentially emancipatory, anticolonial movement against unipolar hegemony is taking shape in the most diverse countries and societies" -- did someone in the 2024 Venice Biennale say that? No, it was Vladimir Putin.

VENICE, Italy — There is a sour tendency in cultural politics today — a growing gap between speaking about the world and acting in it.
In the domain of rhetoric, everyone has grown gifted at pulling back the curtain. An elegant museum gallery is actually a record of imperial violence; a symphony orchestra is a site of elitism and exploitation: these critiques we can now deliver without trying.

The show is remarkably placid, especially in the Giardini. There are large doses of figurative painting and (as customary these days) weaving and tapestry arranged in polite, symmetrical arrays. There is art of great beauty and power, such as three cosmological panoramas by the self-taught Amazonian painter Santiago Yahuarcani, and also far less sophisticated work celebrated by the curator in the exact same way.
In the brutal rounding-down arithmetic of the 2024 Venice Biennale, to be a straniero — a “foreigner” or “stranger,” applied equally to graduates of the world’s most prestigious MFA programs and the mentally ill — implies moral credibility, and moral credibility equals artistic importance. Hence Pedrosa’s inclusion of LGBTQ people as “foreigners,” as if gender or sexuality were proof of progressive bona fides. (Gay men have led far-right parties in the Netherlands and Austria; over at Venice’s Peggy Guggenheim Collection is a wonderfully pervy show of the polymathic Frenchman Jean Cocteau, who praised Nazis while drawing sailors without their bell-bottoms.)
Even more bizarre is the designation of the Indigenous peoples of Brazil and Mexico, of Australia and New Zealand, as “foreigners”; surely they should be the one class of people exempt from such estrangement. In some galleries, categories and classifications take precedence over formal sophistication to a derogatory degree. The Pakistan-born artist Salman Toor, who paints ambiguous scenes of queer New York with real acuity and invention, is shown alongside simplistic queer-and-trans-friendly street art from an Indian NGO “spreading positivity and hope to their communities.”
Over and over, the human complexity of artists gets upstaged by their designation as group members, and art itself gets reduced to a symptom or a triviality. I felt that particularly in three large, shocking galleries in the central pavilion of the Giardini, packed tight with more than 100 paintings and sculptures made in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East between 1915 and 1990. These constitute the bulk of what Pedrosa calls the show’s nucleo storico , its historical core, and this was the part of the Biennale I’d looked forward to most. It had promised to demonstrate that the world outside the North Atlantic has a history of modern art far richer than our leading museums have shown us.
Indeed it does. But you won’t learn that here, where paintings of wildly different importance and quality have been shoved together with almost no historical documentation, cultural context, or even visual delight. It flushes away distinctions between free and unfree regimes or between capitalist and socialist societies, or between those who joined an international avant-garde and those who saw art as a nationalist calling. True pioneers, such as the immense Brazilian innovator Tarsila do Amaral, are equated with orthodox or traditionalist portraitists. More ambitious exhibitions — notably the giant “Postwar,” staged in Munich in 2016-17 — used critical juxtaposition and historical documentation to show how and why an Asian modernism, or an African modernism, looked the way it did. Here in Venice, Pedrosa treats paintings from all over as just so many postage stamps, pasted down with little visual acuity, celebrated merely for their rarity to an implied “Western” viewer.
You thought we were all equals? Here you have the logic of the old-style ethnological museum, transposed from the colonial exposition to the Google Images results page. S.H. Raza of India, Saloua Raouda Choucair of Lebanon, the Cuban American Carmen Herrera, and also painters who were new to me, got reduced to so much Global South wallpaper, and were photographed by visitors accordingly. All of which shows that it’s far too easy to speak art’s exculpatory language, to invoke “opacity” or “fugitivity” or whatever today’s decolonial shibboleth may be. But by othering some 95% of humanity — by designating just about everyone on earth as “foreigners,” and affixing categories onto them with sticky-backed labels — what you really do is exactly what those dreadful Europeans did before you: you exoticize.
And yet, for all that, there is so much I liked in this year’s Biennale! From the central exhibition I am still thinking about a monumental installation of unfired coils of clay by Anna Maria Maiolino, a winner of the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement, that recasts serial production as something intimate, irregular, even anatomical. Karimah Ashadu, who won the Silver Lion for her high-speed film of young men bombing across Lagos on banned motorbikes, gave the economic intensity of megacity life a vigorous visual language. There are the stark, speechless paintings from the 1970s of Romany Eveleigh, whose thousands of scratched little O’s turn writing into an unsemantic howl. There are Yuko Mohri’s mischievously articulated assemblages of found objects, plastic sheeting and fresh fruit, in the Japanese Pavilion, and Precious Okoyomon’s Gesamtkunstwerk of soil, speakers and motion sensors, in the Nigerian Pavilion.
Beyond the Biennale, Christoph Büchel’s frenzied exhibition at the Fondazione Prada assembles mountains of junk and jewels into an impertinent exposé of wealth and debt, colonialism and collecting. In the Palazzo Contarini Polignac, a hazily elegant video by the Odesa-born artist Nikolay Karabinovych reinscribes the Ukrainian landscape as a crossroads of languages, religions and histories. Above all there is Pierre Huyghe, at the Punta della Dogana, who fuses human intelligence and artificial intelligence into the rarest thing of all: an image we have never seen before.
What all these artists have in common is some creative surplus that cannot be exploited — not for a nation’s image, not for a curator’s thesis, not for a collector’s vanity. Rather than the sudsy “politics” of advocacy, they profess that art’s true political value lies in how it exceeds rhetorical function or financial value, and thereby points to human freedom. They are the ones who offered me at least a glimpse of what an equitable global cultural assembly could be: an “anti-museum,” in the phrase of the Cameroonian philosopher Achille Mbembe, where “the exhibiting of subjugated or humiliated humanities” at last becomes a venue where everyone gets to be more than a representative.
I still, unfashionably, keep faith with Mbembe’s dream institution, and the artists here who would have their place in it. But we won’t build it with buzzwords alone, and if anyone had actually been paying attention to the political discourse in this part of the world in a time of war, they would have realized that two can play this game. “An essentially emancipatory, anti-colonial movement against unipolar hegemony is taking shape in the most diverse countries and societies” — did someone in the 2024 Venice Biennale say that? No, it was Vladimir Putin.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A first album, a first restaurant, a first time on Broadway: Ten debuts happening right now.
Name: Ice Spice
Profession: Rapper
Age: 24
Debuting in: Her first full-length album, "Y2K," titled after her birth date -- Jan. 1, 2000 -- which comes out this year.
What she's excited about: "Going on tour. I can't wait to see my fans up close and personal and really interact with them -- interacting with fans online can be a little overwhelming. All their profile pictures are of me. It feels like a bunch of me's talking back: It's weird. Especially when it's pictures I've never seen or don't remember."
What she's nervous about: "I don't even want to put out that energy. People don't need to know what I'm nervous about."
How she works in the studio: "If I was already dressed up and cute, that'd produce a different vibe -- but for the most part I like to be really comfortable. I need inspiration around me, too, so I'll have stacks of money sitting next to the mic. Or I have a bunch of stickers of, like, boobs and butts, stuff like that. They're drawings, though -- I don't just have porn in my studio."
How it's gotten easier since making her EP: "When I was working on [2023's] 'Like ..?,' I was stressed out because I had no idea how the next song was going to come out. Each time, I was like, 'How am I going to make another song that's good?' But then it happened, and then it happened again and again so, after that, I was like, 'OK, making music is really fun.' As long as I'm having fun, it's going to sound fun -- and I'm going to be happy with it." -- J.A.R.
Production: Resin Projects. Makeup: Karina Milan at the Wall Group
Name: Mia Katigbak
Profession: Actress and co-founder of NAATCO
Age: 69
Debuting in: Lincoln Center Theater's revival of Anton Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya" (1899), opening this month.
What she's excited about: "My character, Marina [the central family's maid], infantilizes everyone. Everything is falling apart around her, but she's like, 'Aren't the old ways better?' There are a lot of possibilities in that -- without getting too metaphorical about the state of Russia, politically and socially."
What she's nervous about: "There's always going to be that common nervousness of 'I'm going to mess up,' but somebody brought to my attention that NAATCO [the National Asian American Theatre Company, which was founded in 1989] has done quite a lot of Chekhov; I didn't even realize it, and I chose all of them. What I find fabulous about Chekhov is that there are sad situations but also human comedy. You have to find the funny if you're in dire straits, otherwise you'll slit your wrists."
How she feels about having her Broadway debut after five decades on the New York stage: "You live long enough, [expletive] happens. I'd kind of figured, 'Maybe I'm not Broadway material.' Usually, when Asians get cast, it's a musical, and I'm not a singer-dancer, so it was never necessarily going to be a goal. I'm a little bit more realistic: I recently got a text [with a photo of the 'Uncle Vanya' ad] from a colleague who said, 'Look at Miss Fancy Pants,' and I'm like, 'I'm just a working stiff."'
How she reinterprets classics: "From the get-go, the point of NAATCO was to ask people to open their vistas in terms of 'how, what, by whom, for whom' in theater. We tackled the Western classics first -- William Shakespeare's 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' (1600) and Thornton Wilder's 'Our Town' (1938) -- and my only caveat was not to change them to Asian settings. I remember the first couple of years, maybe decades, people always used to ask, 'Oh, you're doing Shakespeare! Are you going to set it in Japan?' Which isn't bad, but it's not the only way to do it. Reception was mixed; there was criticism from both Asian and non-Asian audiences. When we started to do new work -- with Michael Golamco's 'Cowboy Versus Samurai' in 2005 -- it became a redefinition of what immigrant stories were. Most of the time, the work's thought of as only one thing, so that was something to figure out. But you can say that about all good theater: It's asking you to receive something in a different way." -- J.A.R.
Name: Arielle Smith
Profession: Choreographer
Age: 27
Debuting in: A reimagined "Carmen," based on the French writer Prosper Mérimée's 1845 novella about a Roma woman in southern Spain, which Smith has set instead in Cuba for the version (of the same name) she's choreographing that premieres at San Francisco Ballet this month.
What she's excited about: "As a performer, I trained in classical ballet but then went into contemporary dance -- the reason I fell out of love with ballet was that the female roles didn't feel empowering. Not that I needed to be empowered all the time, but every story was dictated by the relationship a woman has to a man. So when Tamara [Rojo, the company's artistic director] approached me, my first thought was, 'How could we justify another "Carmen"?' I wondered how the story would change if one of her lovers was a woman. Musically it's also not the same -- we've got a new score from the Mexican Cuban composer Arturo O'Farrill [departing from the French composer Georges Bizet's 1875 opera], so it's quite a leap from where it was birthed."
What she's nervous about: "I don't see the point in telling a story again the same way, so that's one element I'm not nervous about ... but I'm about everything else. The challenge is trying to tell an intimate story in a big space. To make this piece well, it has to move people in some way, and that's what I'm anxious to get across -- for people to feel something."
How she's translating the Spanish-set story to Cuba: "Bizet wasn't Spanish, [so] I thought it'd be more interesting to mainly hear Cuban sounds. I'm Cuban; Tamara's Spanish; and [the Uruguayan fashion designer] Gabriela Hearst is our costume designer. It's a full Latinx team, but we're all different. And this is a universal story that's not driven by geography. It's not set on a certain road in Havana but in the soul of these people. I'm not trying to overly examine Cuba. It's about who I am, as a person who happens to be Cuban, and what my voice contributes." -- J.A.R.

Name: Sarah Pidgeon
Profession: Actor
Age: 27 Debuting in: "Stereophonic," a new play by David Adjmi with music by Will Butler (formerly of the indie-rock band Arcade Fire), which transfers to Broadway this month following a run at Playwrights Horizons, where it premiered last fall -- that production was Pidgeon's New York stage debut.
What she's excited about: "This story [about a fictional band's interpersonal struggles while recording an album in the 1970s] talks about relationships and what one has to sacrifice to make art. New York's full of artists, and I'm excited to hear what types of conversations people have after seeing the show."
What she's nervous about: "The transition to the Golden Theatre. Singing's so vulnerable. It's one thing to mess up in front of 200 people, another to mess up in front of four times that many. Off Broadway, we'd have instruments [accidentally] break down halfway through a scene, and we'd have to figure out how to make it feel authentic."
How she created her character, Diana, one of the band's lead singers: "Diana's not looking to other people to give her an example -- she's not following some blueprint. Her band's waiting for her to make that next great song, and she gets commodified really fast. I can't say the same for myself, but I'm [also not dealing with being] a woman in [rock in] the 1970s."
How she settled into the three-hour play's slowed-down, naturalistic rhythms: "Our director, Daniel Aukin, kept talking about a documentary feel. I think the design of the play -- of hearing overlapping conversations -- is [very] fly-on-the-wall. Because of its realism, it can evoke the feeling of a film. There's this sense that it's not necessarily a performance when we're doing these shows; it's not showy. It's this thrill of being able to keep things private while also recognizing there're people in the audience two feet away from you. As an actor, you really feel the tension." -- J.A.R.
Hair: Tsuki at Streeters. Makeup: Monica Alvarez at See Management
Name: Ife Olujobi
Profession: Playwright
Age: 29
Debuting in: "Jordans," her first fully staged production, opening this month at New York's Public Theater under the direction of Whitney White. The play is about a 20-something woman named Jordan (Naomi Lorrain), the only Black employee at a creative studio, whose office life is upended when her boss hires another Jordan (Toby Onwumere), who's also Black, to be the company's director of culture.
What she's excited about: "For a while, this was that play everybody thought was great but nobody wanted to produce. I thought it'd just be a thing that ends up on the page: It's such a crazy, visual play that lives in this imaginative space, with a lot of production elements. I'm excited to bring that to life -- and have it be people's introduction to me."
What she's nervous about: "Making a play that feels current -- in the sense that I started writing it in 2018, did the first reading in 2019 and now we're in 2024. The play addresses the idea of bringing people of color into a [professional] situation as a trend, not out of any genuine interest in them. It has to do with quote-unquote diversity in the workplace, and it feels like we've gone through three different cycles of that conversation since I started writing it. I'm trying to synthesize everything that we've been through in the past six years but not feel like I'm shaping the play to respond to these fluctuations."
How she found her way to playwriting: "I was in the Public's Emerging Writers Group in 2018, which was my introduction to theater. I was never a theater kid; film was my first love -- I'd done my thesis in screenwriting. After I graduated [from New York University], I'd written a play, and I used that to get into the [playwriting] group. The idea for 'Jordans' came partly from my own experience post-grad of being fired three times in a row and being like, 'What's going on?' I was also trying to express something about being the only Black person entering all these professional spaces."
How the play's surrealist tone came to be: "The main character gets coffee poured on her face in the first scene. For me, that was a big breaking open of the play: 'This is the kind of world that she's living in. What else can happen in this world?' It has what we might call surreal elements, but I don't always think about it that way because, within this play, everything is real. It's not a dream." -- J.A.R.
Photo assistant: Serena Nappa. Digital tech: Zachary Smith. Production: Shay Johnson Studio
Name: Dae Kim
Profession: Chef
Age: 28
Debuting in: Noksu, the 14-seat tasting counter he's run since last October below ground in Manhattan's Herald Square, where he serves Korean-inflected dishes, including grilled mackerel with brown butter and squab with gochujang agrodolce.
What he's excited about: "I had a feeling, during the pandemic, that something might change -- like everyone had to start [again] from zero. Even three-star sous-chefs changed careers: They've stopped working in restaurants; they're selling truffles or doing kitchen shows or TikToks. There was a gap, and I thought if I played up my Asian heritage and my French cooking background, someone would be looking for that. Then I met [the restaurant's] owners, and they offered me this space in a Koreatown subway station."
What he's nervous about: "With restaurants, you prove yourself every day. There's no tomorrow, no next week. I knew I had to have a tasting menu: I have a personal goal -- I'm not telling anyone what it is -- and, to reach that level, I think it can only be a tasting menu. I'm not enjoying cooking that much; it's not a passion. This is my career. I don't cook at home but, if I think about that goal, it makes me come to the restaurant."
What he took from working at the New York restaurants Per Se and Silver Apricot: "I really thought, 'What kind of person am I? What kind of cook? What's my individualism?' Working in fine dining is such an honor, but it's their food. It's not me. I started focusing on food that would represent who I was."
How he's handling everyone's dietary restrictions: "Right now, we don't accommodate, because we're a small kitchen. But sometimes they can push you: If a guest can't eat dairy, how do you make that sauce creamy without using milk? It requires more work, more thought, more team effort. It's happened a couple of times, and we just freestyle." -- J.A.R.
Name: Tyla
Profession: Singer-songwriter
Age: 22
Debuting in: Her first full-length album, "Tyla," released last month. It's the product of more than two years of collaboration with writers and producers from around the world -- and her first time traveling outside of South Africa (she grew up in Johannesburg). Together, they refined her sound, which she describes as "music that people can dance to: Afrobeats, pop, R&B and amapiano," the last of which is syncopated electronic music that originated in South Africa in the 2010s.
What she's excited about: "My first tour. My creative director, Thato Nzimande, and I have been speaking about this forever. I have Coachella coming up and, after sitting for so long with this music and all these ideas, I'm excited to see people's reactions."
What she's nervous about: "I used to be very nervous about performing because all of this is very new and, once something's on the internet, it's saved forever. I don't want to look at it years from now and be cringing. I'm a perfectionist but, as an artist, you're never going to be happy with everything all the time. That's something I had to learn -- how to let go."
How she synthesizes South African and American influences: "I love the sound of amapiano production, with the log drum and the shakers and the drops. But I've also always wanted to be a chart-topper like Michael Jackson and Britney Spears and now SZA, except I wanted to do it with my sound [her first hit, "Water," debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 in October]. Obviously, people believe, 'Oh, I have to make just pop.' But that's boring to me. I want to sell what I know and love."
Why South African music has global appeal: "People say they can feel it, and that's cool because we feel it. It's very spiritual to us; it's a genre we feel in our bodies. All these amapiano dance moves that everyone does, it's not even dancers that come up with these moves -- it's just random people, drunk uncles in the corners of clubs. It's organic, and I think people are looking for that genuine vibe." -- E.L.
Production: Shay Johnson Studio. Hair: Christina "Tina" Trammell. Makeup: Jamal Scott for YSL Beauty
Name: Justin Peck
Profession: Director and choreographer
Age: 36
Debuting in: "Illinoise," the first stage musical he's directing, which opens this month on Broadway after a run last month at the Park Avenue Armory. Based on the singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens's 2005 indie-folk album, "Illinois," the show was also conceived and choreographed by Peck, who collaborated on its narrative with the playwright Jackie Sibblies Drury.
What he's excited about: "The 'Illinois' song cycle [in which every track relates to the Midwestern state] is one of the great albums of the last 20 years: [Sufjan] didn't have a recording studio; he'd find a musician up in [New York's] Washington Heights and record a violin part without realizing what it was going to be part of -- he'd run all over, assembling [bits]. I've had a long collaboration with him [Peck has based six ballets on Stevens's music, beginning with "Year of the Rabbit" for New York City Ballet in 2012], so it feels full circle, having discovered that album as a teenager."
What he's nervous about: "It's not a conventional musical; it lives between genres. It's framed as a gathering around a campfire, being intoxicated by the heat ... a campfire beckons storytelling. We enter into the worlds of these people sharing stories on an evening in the wilderness. That's a difficult thing for managing audience expectations. One of the most challenging parts is trying to tell a full story without words. There are lyrics, but even the lyrics have a sense of poetry to them. They're not literal."
How he brought on board his collaborator Jackie Sibblies Drury: "Sufjan was involved early in developing the musical arrangements but has been relatively hands-off [since being diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome, an autoimmune disorder, last year] and wasn't in a place where he wanted to go back to that time in his life. I needed a storytelling partner. Jackie told me how much she loved the album; when she moved to Chicago, she and her then boyfriend listened to it on the road there. A lot of these songs resonated with both of us at a coming-of-age time in our lives, and that's part of our approach: intimate and personal." -- J.A.R.
Production: Shay Johnson Studio. Photo assistants: Shinobu Mochizuki, Tom Rauner. Digital tech: Kyle Knodell
Name: Maisy Stella
Profession: Actress and singer
Age: 20
Debuting in: "My Old Ass," a coming-of-age comedy in which her character, Elliott, a young woman leaving her small Canadian hometown for college, meets her 39-year-old self, played by Aubrey Plaza, while tripping on mushrooms. In theaters this August, it's Stella's first movie -- and her first acting project since spending much of the past decade on the TV series "Nashville" (2012-18), in which she played a country star's singer daughter.
What she's excited about: "Being reintroduced in a way that feels true to me. I was a baby when 'Nashville' started; it's hard to have people see you as a character for so many years. You have to be careful with the next thing you do, especially after you take a break [to finish high school], and I wanted to be represented in a way that felt genuine and pushed me in the direction I wanted to go. I thought a project like this would come 10 years down the line, if ever."
What she's nervous about: "I think I confuse anticipation with anxiety. I just feel general anticipation all the time, whether it's about a date this weekend or this movie coming out; it's that feeling that something's about to happen. In my body, I might confuse it with nerves, but there are happy and cozy feelings, as well, so it levels out."
How she collaborated with the writer-director Megan Park on her dialogue: "I watch a lot of young adult shows and think, 'Oh my God, we sound so dumb. We don't talk like that.' Not everything's abbreviated and slang. Megan [who's 37] knows how to write for Gen Z because she includes us in her process. She doesn't have an ego and molds her characters to who's playing them. We'd do scripted takes and then 'fun runs,' where we got to improv, and she'd add lines in the moment."
What was it like creating the template for Plaza's character: "You'd think Aubrey would've come first, but I was the first one attached to the film. In any other situation, it'd be me matching her, but I feel like Elliott is very similar to me so, when Aubrey and I met, I could feel her filming me with her eyes, trying to get a scope." -- J.A.R.
Hair and makeup: Laura Godwin
Name: Sky Lakota-Lynch
Profession: Actor
Age: 32
Debuting in: "The Outsiders," a new musical that opened this month and is based on S.E. Hinton's 1967 novel about rival teen gangs. Lakota-Lynch plays Johnny Cade, a shy 16-year-old from an abusive home. He appeared in "Dear Evan Hansen" in 2018, but this is his first time originating a role on Broadway.
What he's excited about: "I've been with the show for six years, and it finally feels fully baked. People are going to be expecting us to come out tap-dancing, but you have [the writer] Adam Rapp and [the director] Danya Taymor, and those people have never done a musical. It's the ultimate place for an actor-singer. It's truly a play with music [by Zach Chance and Jonathan Clay of the folk duo Jamestown Revival, and the songwriter Justin Levine], and I think it's going to shock people."
What he's nervous about: "It's going to be sad to eventually let Johnny go. I'm doing this on Broadway, but it's like the period at the end of the sentence."
How he's approaching playing a beloved character: "Johnny doesn't have a lot of lines: He's like an Edward Scissorhands [type] -- I have to fill the space with energy. The cool thing about playing the character is that I got to imbue him with myself. I'm Native American and Black, and the story is set in Tulsa, Okla., where that's [not uncommon]. My costume has Native American embroidery; my version of Johnny feels fully fleshed out. Of course, I stole things from Ralph [Macchio, who played the role in the 1983 Francis Ford Coppola film] and from the novel -- it's that fine line between tough and tender, but it's tailored to me." -- J.A.R.

Corrections: An earlier version of this article misquoted Ife Olujobi in a few instances. Olujobi said she worked at the Criterion Collection after she graduated from N.Y.U., not while she was in college. Separately, Olujobi said the play that she used to apply to the Public Theater's Emerging Writers Workshop was a work she wrote during college, not "Jordans." An earlier version of a picture caption with this article also misstated the location where Maisy Stella was photographed; it was Fannie Mae Dees Park in Nashville, not Percy Priest Lake Park.

Using His Art To Challenge All Traditions: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Dav­óne Tines, who stars in the oratorio "El Niño," is challenging traditions in classical music and using art to confront social problems.
The bass-baritone Dav­óne Tines, wearing Dr. Martens boots, a sleeveless black shirt and six vintage pearl rings, stood on a rehearsal stage at the Metropolitan Opera in Manhattan the other day and began to sing.
"My soul's above the sea and whistling a dream," he sang, a passage from the Nativity oratorio "El Niño" by John Adams, in which Tines makes his Met debut this month. "Tell the shepherds the wind is saddling its horse."
Tines, 37, known for his raw intensity and thundering voice, has quickly become one of classical music's brightest stars. He has won acclaim for performances of Bach, Handel and Stravinsky, and he has helped champion new music, originating roles in operas like Adams's "Girls of the Golden West" and Terence Blanchard's "Fire Shut Up in My Bones."
Tines has also used his art to confront social problems, including racism and police brutality. In 2018, he was a creator of and starred in "The Black Clown," a searing rumination on Black history and identity inspired by a Langston Hughes poem. In 2020, he released a music video after the police killing of Breonna Taylor, calling for empathy and action.
During a rehearsal break at the Met, he described his art as cathartic, saying his aim was to "pick apart the complicated, contentious existence that is knit into the American landscape."
"It's a blessing to be a performing artist because you get an explicit place to put your feelings," he said. "It's the blessing of having a channel."
Those feelings are expressed in a voice that is "not only low, but profound," said the theater director Peter Sellars, who helped start Tines's career in 2014 when he cast him in the chamber opera "Only the Sound Remains," with music by Kaija Saariaho. "He really goes to very extreme and intense places," Sellars said. "The performance is not just nice, it's not just acceptable, it's not just neat and well done. It has the quality that we're present for an occasion."
Through his wide-ranging work, Tines has helped to upend traditions in classical music. He has torn up the typical recital format, presenting deeply personal, carefully curated programs instead. He has embraced a wide variety of genres, moving freely from Bach cantatas to Black spirituals to minimalist music and gospel.
And Tines, at nearly 6 feet 3 inches with a muscular build, has challenged notions of what a classical star should look like. He wore a sleeveless all-white robe dress and Prada boots for the role of Jesus in Bach's "St. Matthew Passion" with the New York Philharmonic last year. ("Jesus wears Prada," he wrote on Instagram.) At the Grammys, he wore a sweater-dress inspired by his grandmother and decorated his shoes with earrings, as she often did before going to church.
As a gay Black man from Northern Virginia, Tines said he has often felt like an outsider. At a Lincoln Center cafe, he looked across the street to the Juilliard School, his alma mater. He began to recount his struggles there, describing how he felt misunderstood by teachers and colleagues because he could not relate to the standard vocal repertoire.
"I had to find my own path," he said. "I had to find myself in other ways."
Tines grew up in Fauquier County, Va., about an hour and a half outside of Washington, where his family has lived for generations. As a child, he was acutely aware of the racial and economic divisions in his hometown; he once said he "grew up in a Ralph Lauren ad on slave burial ground." He was raised primarily by his grandparents. (His grandmother still calls at least twice a day.)
He grew up singing at a Baptist church in Orlean, Va. His grandfather, who served in the military and rose to become a chief warrant officer at the Pentagon, had served as music director at several churches in the area. But Tines's real passion was for the violin, which he played in youth ensembles, rising to the rank of concertmaster. His grandparents encouraged him to give singing a try, and in high school he won leading roles in productions of "Ragtime" and "Les Misérables."
He went to college at Harvard, where he studied sociology. It was not until his senior year, when he took part in a production of Stravinsky's opera "The Rake's Progress," that he began to think more seriously about opera.
At Juilliard, where he enrolled for graduate studies, he said he felt dehumanized because people were seen "for what they can do, as opposed to who they are." He also felt a disconnect with the core repertoire -- works like Schubert's "Winterreise," which depicts a man dealing with the rejection of a woman he loves.
"I had to contend with the assumption," he said, "that this was the repertoire that I cared to engage with."
But he found ways to connect. When he was struggling with a Brahms song about missing a loved one, he thought about his mother, who died when he was 22.
"I found that if I envisioned a person that I loved and then lost, I could sing the song with integrity," he said. "This very long phrase in the Brahms was an incredible vehicle for holding all the wailing and crying I still had to do."
In the early phase of his career, Tines said he felt like a hermit crab looking for bigger shells as he moved from show to show. He developed a specialty in new music, working with composers he had met in school.
When Matthew Aucoin, a Harvard classmate, was working on "Crossing," an opera about Walt Whitman's time as a nurse during the Civil War that premiered in 2015, he wrote the role of an escaped slave fighting for the Union for Tines.
Aucoin said he was drawn to Tines's perceptiveness and his tender falsetto register. "He's a Renaissance man," he said, "blessed with not only a voice but also a fabulously keen eye, ear and mind."
Sellars, who had heard Tines sing at Juilliard, hired him for "Only the Sound Remains," which premiered in Amsterdam in 2016. Tines landed leading roles in other contemporary operas, playing Ned Peters, a runaway slave, in "Girls of the Golden West," and Charles in "Fire Shut Up in My Bones," based on a memoir by The New York Times columnist Charles M. Blow.
But it was "The Black Clown," which came to New York in 2019, that cemented his reputation as a visionary performer. Working with the composer Michael Schachter and the director Zack Winokur, he adapted Hughes's poem into a teeming work of music, dance and theater, winning raves for his performance.
Tines, who had admired Hughes since fifth grade, said the poem "struck me like a lightning bolt."
"The fact that someone was able to speak something that was so personally riveting," he said, "but also so universal, was a revelation."
When the Black Lives Matter protests spread in 2020, Tines was at first hesitant to use art to speak out. But he felt that the public was not fully comprehending the significance of the death of Breonna Taylor. In "Vigil," he looks into the camera, his eyes filled with tears.
"Where there is darkness," he sings, "we'll bring light."
Tines's Black identity has continued to feature prominently in his work. In 2022, he and the violinist Jennifer Koh created "Everything Rises," a multimedia show about their experiences as people of color in a predominantly white field that incorporated conversations with their relatives.
Adams said that Tines had an ability to "embody that particular kind of nobility and eloquence that you find in the great Black orators."
"He really has a style to his singing that is unique," Adams said, "in an operatic world where people sound more and more like each other."
Tines has won praise for helping redefine the concert experience. In "Recital No. 1: MASS," which came to Carnegie Hall in 2022, he played with the traditional Latin mass structure. He blended Bach with spirituals and other contemporary works, including pieces by Caroline Shaw, Tyshawn Sorey and Julius Eastman, as soul-searching questions were projected behind him.
Tines is now at work on a project, with his band, Dav­óne & the Truth, about Paul Robeson, the pioneering singer, actor and activist with whom he is often compared. (Robeson, known for his rendition of "Ol' Man River" and other songs, died in 1976.) He is tracing Robeson's life and music, including a suicide attempt in a Moscow hotel room in 1961.
Tines, who recently had Robeson's name tattooed on his left arm, said he was drawn to the vulnerability of that moment in Robeson's life.
"I could connect to him more in a way to see that he wasn't just a billboard of its Black exceptionalism," he said, "but actually just a human."
In recent days, Tines has been focused on "El Niño," a work that he has performed several times over the past decade. In the oratorio, which is fully staged at the Met, he sings a variety of roles, including Joseph and Herod; at one point, he is the voice of God.
The soprano Julia Bullock, a classmate from Juilliard who is also singing in "El Niño," said she was pleased to see her friend find a place in classical music.
"He's really arriving at something," she said. "It's good fun and play and experimentation. It doesn't feel like he's worn down or overwhelmed. It's cool. It's really cool."
The other night, after a day of rehearsals at the Met, Tines was at the Blue Building in Manhattan to perform in "Art is Gay," a night of song and dance hosted by Art Bath, a performance salon. He sang a contemporary version of the hymn "I'll Fly Away" and an arrangement of a Bach cantata.
Before the show, as the performers were putting on makeup and costumes, Tines approached the countertenor Anthony Roth Costanzo, who asked how he was faring with "El Niño."
"Are you alive?" Costanzo said, embracing him.
"It was a long day," Tines said. "I was at the Met from 9 to 5." Costanzo snapped his fingers, and the two started singing Dolly Parton's "9 to 5."
Sitting on a couch at the Blue Building, Tines showed off his pearls, which he has collected while performing in Hong Kong, Germany, St. Louis and elsewhere.
As his Met debut approached, he said he was striving to be a "clear glass" -- to make himself "as simple as possible, so that the largess and complexity of what you're hoping to touch has the space to exist."
"More so than ever," he said, "I hope to leave people and myself with an experience that's quite far beyond people or myself."

Music Catalog Giant Hipgnosis In $1.4 Billion Sale to Concord: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Hipgnosis, which owns the rights to songs by Justin Bieber and Neil Young, helped kick-start a rush on catalog sales. But its future has been in doubt.
Hipgnosis Songs Fund, the British company that helped kick-start the music industry's rush for catalog deals -- acquiring tens of thousands of songs by Justin Bieber, Neil Young, Shakira and others -- but that has seen its share price plummet has reached a tentative deal to sell itself to Concord, a major independent music company, for $ 1.4 billion.
Hipgnosis, which trades on the London Stock Exchange, said on Thursday that its board had given unanimous approval. But the deal still faces what could be a significant hurdle in the form of a contractual option held by an affiliated company to buy the catalog at a set price.
Robert Naylor, the chairman of Hipgnosis, said in a statement: "The acquisition represents an attractive opportunity for our shareholders to immediately realize their holding at a premium, mitigating the risks we see ahead to achieving a material improvement in the share price."
Bob Valentine, the chief executive of Concord, which has a portfolio of labels like Stax and Craft, and large holdings in music publishing, added: "We believe we can integrate Hipgnosis' catalogs into our wider portfolio of 1.2 million songs in a way that will deliver benefits for composers, performers and all our stakeholders."
Concord's cash offer, of $ 1.16 per share, represents a 32 percent premium over Hipgnosis' last closing share price, though it is still down almost 28 percent from the stock's peak in November 2021.
The Concord acquisition, if it goes through, would end one of the most tumultuous stories in the recent history of the music business. Hipgnosis, founded by Merck Mercuriadis, a longtime music executive who once managed superstar acts like Beyoncé, Guns N' Roses and Elton John, went public in 2018, with a splashy pitch to investors -- and artists -- that the royalties from the copyrights of popular songs could be "more valuable than gold or oil."
The company spent about $ 2.2 billion on catalog acquisitions, with top artists like Bieber receiving up to $ 200 million for rights to their songs. As recently as September, the value of the Hipgnosis catalog was estimated at $ 2.6 billion by an independent financial firm.
In the process, Mercuriadis became something of a celebrity on the business side of music. Always appearing in a black Prada jacket, he presented himself as a sympathetic advocate for artists and a vociferous critic of the major music conglomerates. Mercuriadis also spoke of using Hipgnosis' leverage in the marketplace to push for better financial deals for songwriters overall.
"People look at songs as being inanimate objects; I don't," he told The New York Times in an interview in 2020. "I think that they're the great energy that makes the world go 'round, and I think that they deserve to be managed with the same level of responsibility that human beings do."
In the company's complicated structure, Hipgnosis Songs Fund, the listed entity, is an "investment trust" that owns the song rights, while a separate company, Hipgnosis Song Management -- owned by Mercuriadis and the giant investment firm Blackstone -- is its "investment adviser," doing much of the work of acquiring those assets.
Over the last couple of years, as interest rates rose, the company's share price plunged. In October, after the company suspended its dividend, shareholders voted against maintaining the company's structure as an investment trust, which set in motion a strategic review and an evaluation of its assets by a new financial adviser.
That evaluation, announced in March, reduced the value of Hipgnosis' assets by 26 percent, to just under $ 2 billion, and offered a harsh review of its business practices. Hipgnosis Song Management, according to the review, had overpaid for the majority of its catalog and overstated the fund's revenue and earnings; and Hipgnosis Songs Fund had overstated the ownership stakes that it had in many songs.
In announcing its agreement with Concord, Hipgnosis said it would "encourage" the investment adviser to terminate its so-called call option, which gives it the right to match any third-party offer. Hipgnosis Song Management did not immediately respond to request for comment.

The Point Guard Wears Prada on the Orange Carpet: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The next class of basketball stars are ready for their close-ups. Finally, fashion is paying attention.
When it comes to peacocks, it's hard to beat male athletes. Their tunnel walks have been painstakingly documented; their fits have dominated the draft day conversations for the N.B.A. and the N.F.L.; their love of Vuitton and Hermès has been parlayed into brands of their own.
But on Monday evening at the W.N.B.A. draft, following the most-watched women's college basketball game in history and the most-watched basketball game at any level since 2019, that all changed. Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and Cameron Brink, among others, saw that style marker and raised it one.
Well, they are elite competitors -- in image-making as on the court. Fashion, it seems, has finally figured that out. Stylists and brands are waking up and reaching out.
"People are seeing us for who we are now," said Rickea Jackson, the No. 4 pick of the night, who is going to the Los Angeles Sparks.
It started with Ms. Clark, the No. 1 pick, who is going to the Indiana Fever and continued her record-breaking streak by becoming the first basketball player, man or woman, to be fully decked out by Prada for the draft.
She wore a white satin miniskirt and oversize shirt with rhinestone buttons and a cropped rhinestone top, tinted aviators and black sling-backs, and she carried a small patent leather Prada bag. The net effect was very "future of my sport." Prada had approached her, she said, or at least her styling team, which is a coronation of a different sort.
She wasn't the only one to go haute. Ms. Reese, the seventh pick, going to the Chicago Sky, worked with Naomi Elizée, the Vogue fashion editor who had styled her for her draft declaration in that magazine, and looked as if she had taken a side road on her way to the Met Gala. See her backless Bronx and Banco silver knit dress with a plunging V-neck and hood and coordinating Christian Louboutin pumps, which she duly name-checked in her strut down the orange carpet.
"I wanted something that was going to pop," Ms. Reese said of her dress. And she wanted to seize the moment. "I don't want to just be a great basketball player," she said. "I want to leave my impact. I want to be a model. I can cook. I can do hair. I can do nails. I can do it all."
That is, in the end, why all of this matters. Fashion is the fastest route to personal branding, which leads to influence, which leads to an even bigger stage. Not to mention endorsements, no small consideration given the continuing salary disparities between men and women in professional basketball. (Ms. Clark's base salary will be $ 76,535.)
So there was Ms. Brink, chosen second and going to the Los Angeles Sparks, in a black and white asymmetric Balmain gown with a slit to the upper thigh and a rose on one shoulder. She found the dress with the help of the stylist for the actress and Sweet July founder Ayesha Curry (her husband, Steph Curry, being Ms. Brink's godbrother).
And there was Alissa Pili, of Samaoan and Indigenous Alaskan descent, who was chosen by the Minnesota Lynx, and who worked with the designer Jason Wu to make a dress that, she said, paid honor to her heritage and the people who got her to the draft. Hence the gold Polynesian print on the skirt and a silhouette cut to showcase the tribal tattoos on her leg and shoulder and, she said, "to represent them on the biggest stage."
There was a lot of white, not just on Ms. Clark but also on Aaliyah Edwards (No. 6, Washington Mystics), who carried a crystal handbag shaped like a basketball, because, she said, "I always have a ball in my hand," and Celeste Taylor (No. 15, Indiana Fever).
Also red, on Kamilla Cardoso, the No. 3 pick, going to the Chicago Sky, who wore a sharply tailored suit, and Ms. Jackson, who, taking a page from the Oscar red carpet, swapped the crimson bustier and trousers she had worn on the orange carpet with some Cartier crystal sunglasses for a sparkling silver suit when she took the draft stage.
The looks "gave two different vibes, so I said, 'Why not?"' Ms. Jackson said. She found them with the help of Tasha Hartzog, a stylist who had messaged her on Instagram. "The first was Detroit fierce, and I am from Detroit, and the second was more glitz and glam," Ms. Jackson said. "I know that where I'm going I am going to want to style it. And I want to be big."
The point, she continued, is "the bigger you get, the more people that brings, the more eyes, the more money."
"We are people outside of basketball," she said. "You have your own brand." Even if she and her draft mates are only at the beginning of their careers.
"One day, the ball is going to stop bouncing," she said. "So you want to have things in place for what's next."

Full text: "To be perfectly honest with you, I needed a few Americans to tell me what it means to win this award," said David Fischer, the founder of the company Highsnobiety.
Mr. Fischer was sitting in an airport in Spain, wearing a denim jacket and a designer baseball cap. About 10 days earlier, in New York City, Highsnobiety won a National Magazine Award for general excellence -- its first nomination and win at the Oscars of the magazine world.
"I'm not a journalist by background, nor would I consider myself a great writer," Mr. Fischer, 41, who lives in Berlin, said.
He started Highsnobiety as a sneaker blog in 2005. Today it is a website that covers fashion and youth culture broadly. It is also a clothing store and clothing line and, more lucratively, a creative consultancy and production agency. In other words, Highsnobiety writes about and recommends T-shirts, but it also makes its own T-shirts, sells and advertises other labels' T-shirts, advises brands on how to market their T-shirts and throws big parties in honor of T-shirts.
But is Highsnobiety a media company? "It's certainly not a clear yes," Mr. Fischer said. "I was mostly interested in finding exciting new things and putting those things in front of the audience. And I suppose I was always excited about building a brand, more than anything."
The magazine is printed twice a year. Its stories and images are frenetic, meant to speak to readers who are either young and cool or interested in being young and cool. The editor in chief is Willa Bennett, who ran social media at GQ magazine until 2022.
On the April night she accepted Highsnobiety's National Magazine Award, her former boss, the GQ editor Will Welch, was "hooting and hollering" (his words) for the 30-year-old woman. She wore a gray Thom Browne suit with a matching skirt layered over the pants, and black Tabi cleft-toe shoes. She spoke into a microphone about how magazines are important and how print media matters.
Neither is a given in the current media landscape. About six months ago, Condé Nast announced it would cut five percent of its work force, following some years of turmoil and nine-figure annual losses. Hearst Magazines announced layoffs in 2023. So did, for that matter, Highsnobiety.
And yet people are still making magazines. Nylon returned to print this month; last month, the new owners of Complex magazine and Life magazine announced print resuscitations. In New York, new indie titles like Family Style and Byline have emerged.
Ms. Bennett is idealistic about this future. She is generally cheerful, prone to skipping down sidewalks, even while wearing a smirk that borrows more from Daria than Mary Tyler Moore. She is also uncommonly curious about people -- especially young people, whose ideas and skills she mines for the magazine.
"I believe it's my responsibility to, like, make sure that young people still dream of being journalists," she said. "We just need to keep iterating and continuing to stretch what it means."
Suiting Up
Ms. Bennett is known to wear a suit and tie to work most days, not unlike the workers surrounding her in Manhattan's financial district.
Highsnobiety's offices rise 11 floors above the Charging Bull sculpture. On one wall, the words "Virgil was here" are scrawled beneath the company's logo. The designer Virgil Abloh shared many of the same interests as Highsnobiety: adolescence, corporate collaborations, the blurring of high-end fashion and "streetwear."
Ms. Bennett's cube-shaped office houses various gifts. She has an action figure of the rapper ASAP Rocky, dressed in an outfit from his Highsnobiety photo shoot. She has a skateboard and a basketball hoop, though she neither skates nor hoops. There is a framed thank-you note from Donatella Versace and a receipt for $ 19,010 from the Château Marmont in Hollywood, where Highsnobiety co-hosted a dinner before the Grammys in February.
Inside a conference room named after the famous Berlin nightclub Berghain, Ms. Bennett hosts regular brainstorming sessions. It is here, for example, that she was inspired to pursue a cover story on Dries Van Noten, the 65-year-old Belgian designer who recently announced his retirement.
"We were all talking about how Dries is the best," she said. "This consistent designer that young people can always trust."
The spring issue had three cover stars: Mr. Van Noten, the musician Andre 3000 (age 48) and the model-actress Pamela Anderson (age 56), none of whom seem like intuitive choices for a magazine that typically concerns itself with young emerging talent. The previous three cover stars were the rapper Lil Yachty (26), the TikToker Khaby Lame (24) -- a story Ms. Bennett assigned to a fellow TikToker, whom she later realized was still a sophomore at New York University -- and the model Grace Valentine (23).
Still, even if the subjects were older, Highsnobiety's approach to them was not. "Pamela Anderson Is Mother," one headline read. Ms. Anderson was a more personal choice for Ms. Bennett, who wrote in the issue that Ms. Anderson's 1989 Playboy cover once hung on her bedroom wall.
On that cover, Ms. Anderson wore a blazer and tie and nothing else. She wore a blazer and tie on her Highsnobiety cover, too. Women are often styled in men's wear in the magazine's pages. Squint a little and Billie Eilish, the first cover star chosen by Ms. Bennett, bears a resemblance to the editor -- the bare face, the dark hair with a middle part, the head tilted slightly downward. She looks as if she's glaring at you, but really it's more like she's taking the measure of you.
Ms. Bennett also studies people, more comfortable asking questions than answering them. (How was your day? What are your favorite brands? Do you like writing?) Standing outside Cubbyhole, a West Village lesbian bar, she would only point vaguely in a direction when asked where in the neighborhood she lived with her partner, a television writer.
The personal details she was willing to part with were these: Ms. Bennett grew up in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles and attended the private school Oakwood. Her parents were divorced. She lived with her mother, a therapist who moved to Hawaii when she was in college. Her father, a prominent music manager, lived in Nashville for most of her life. She wears his birth year, 1950, on a silver ring.
Ms. Bennett came out when she was a teenager, she said, in the comments section of the Australian pop star Troye Sivan's coming-out YouTube video -- an anecdote she later shared with Mr. Sivan while they were seated next to each other at a Prada runway show.
She had always wanted to be a writer. "At the time, 'Twilight' was huge," Ms. Bennett said. "I was like, I'm going to write the gay 'Twilight."'
But she was also drawn from a young age to the power of magazine covers -- not only Ms. Anderson on Playboy, but also Cory Kennedy on Nylon and Megan Fox on GQ. "What does it mean for a men's magazine to have someone like Megan Fox on the cover?" she said.
A onetime ballerina, Ms. Bennett attended Sarah Lawrence College on a dance scholarship. When she told her adviser she wanted to write for magazines, the adviser suggested she write her thesis about the future of the industry. Instead Ms. Bennett pitched embedding in a middle school for four weeks, writing "about what teens are reading and how they're reading it," she said. The project helped her land a job after graduation at Seventeen.
"She really is a voice of and a champion of what young people care about," Mr. Welch, the GQ editor, said. "And what young people care about isn't exclusively, necessarily, all young subjects."
Ms. Bennett, for example, doesn't seem to hang out at bars or restaurants catering to the city's cool 20-somethings. She spends her time at established fashion and media haunts, like Via Carota or Minetta Tavern or the Odeon. One recent Thursday night, walking into the Odeon in TriBeCa, she immediately recognized a few young editors sitting at a table outside the restaurant.
She used to work with them at GQ, she explained, bouncing over to the table to say hello. "They said they all work at Vogue now," Ms. Bennett reported when she returned.
'Larger Than Life'
By the end of 2005, Mr. Fischer was fielding brand requests to advertise on his sneaker blog. By 2010, those advertisements had shifted to sponsored content -- or brands paying Highsnobiety to write positive pieces.
Over time, Mr. Fischer said, he realized branded stories "performed best if we shot our own imagery, too," rather than republishing photos from the companies. This is how Highsnobiety gradually became "more like a full service creative agency, rather than just being a publisher." Brands began asking Highsnobiety to host events, like pop-ups or parties related to the content Mr. Fischer's team was producing.
"We always kept it very connected to our editorial," he said.
Many companies that produce journalism have strict church-and-state divisions between editorial and advertising efforts. The division at Highsnobiety is more like "God and church," said Nichelle Sanders, the general manager of Highsnobiety in the United States.
The journalism "inspires us in the commercial efforts that we create," said Ms. Sanders, who also oversees Highsnobiety's research papers of consumer insights into its audience. "The reason our clients come to us is because we can get into the brain of this amazing editorial team."
Those clients include Champion, best known for its sweatsuits, when it's looking to reach cooler, younger shoppers. Voilà, suddenly Champion and Highsnobiety are hosting a rave together during London Fashion Week, partnering with an edgy local radio station. (Highsnobiety once collaborated on a T-shirt with The New York Times, one of many products created for an event series celebrating New York.)
Mr. Fischer does not worry about his audience being skeptical of these paid partnerships.
"I think people have accepted that brands like Highsnobiety and influencers need to make a living," he said. While it is an open secret in fashion media that some magazine covers and features can be bought outright by advertisers, with no disclosure to readers, Highsnobiety denies engaging in that kind of pay-for-play.
"They can go through the sales side, and they can buy branded content," Ms. Bennett said. "They cannot buy a magazine cover."
Although the company declined to provide specific financial figures, it is profitable, according to Juergen Hopfgartner, the president and chief operating officer. Its e-commerce business is also growing, aided by the resources of Zalando, an online German retailer that paid 123.6 million euros (about $ 131 million) to acquire Highsnobiety in 2022. In February, Highsnobiety opened a store in Berlin that, beyond selling products, will be used as a "brand activation space" for clients, Mr. Hopfgartner said.
All things considered, it is not surprising that Mr. Fischer described his company as a "weird mishmash of these different worlds."
Lauren Sherman, the writer of the fashion industry newsletter Line Sheet, said that Highsnobiety "doesn't feel like it comes from journalism."
"It feels like it comes from commerce," she continued. "But that's very modern."
And that may be what is required to find success in the dire publishing landscape of 2024. But a distinct, assertive voice also helps.
In less than two years, in addition to winning the National Magazine Award, Ms. Bennett has shifted Highsnobiety's audience from predominantly male to a 50-50 gender split, Mr. Fischer said. At GQ, Mr. Welch said, Ms. Bennett possessed a rare confidence and fearlessness, particularly for someone who was both very young and technically in charge only of the social feeds.
"She has a bit of that larger-than-life thing that a lot of the leaders in this industry are missing now," Ms. Sherman said.
In her slouchy suits, Ms. Bennett somewhat reminds Ms. Sherman of the editors with big personalities that she grew up idolizing, like Liz Tilberis of Harper's Bazaar or Jane Pratt of Jane.
"People who are like that just don't go into magazine publishing anymore," Ms. Sherman said.

Full text: Love, spats, splits and enduring affinity: creative partnerships that have stood the test of time.
JANE FONDA AND LILY TOMLIN, ACTRESSES Have co-starred in three films and a TV show, from "9 to 5" (1980) to "80 for Brady" (2023).
JANE FONDA: It was 1978, and I heard that Lily Tomlin was performing in a [one-woman] show called "Appearing Nitely" in Los Angeles. I don't know how many characters she played, but she embodied them all so fully. I was smitten. I went backstage to meet her. At the time, I was in the process of developing "9 to 5" [the 1980 comedy about a trio of female office workers who overthrow the company's sexist boss] and, as I was driving home, I thought, "I don't want to be in a movie about secretaries unless Lily Tomlin is in it."
LILY TOMLIN: She swept in backstage with a big cape on. We couldn't believe it -- this was Jane Fonda! For a couple of years, I'd worn a hairdo from "Klute" [the 1971 thriller for which Fonda won an Oscar], but I didn't have it when she showed up that day. I was like, "Why did I drop my 'Klute' hairdo at this propitious time?"
J.F.: It took a good year to convince Lily and Dolly [Parton, the film's other lead] to do the movie. It's not that they weren't interested, but it was very difficult. Why was it so difficult, Lily?
L.T.: I think I was that way about everything.
J.F.: You are that way about everything: "I don't know if I can do this. I'm not right for the part." You do that every time. But it was your idea to get Colin Higgins to direct and to cast Dabney Coleman [as the boss]. You should've been the one producing it! My only decision was to make the movie, because one of my close friends, [the former director of the U.S. Department of Labor Women's Bureau] Karen Nussbaum, would tell me stories about organizing women office workers and what they had to go through.
L.T.: I thought I had some lines that were hitting you over the head with the joke. Yet when the movie was released, those lines got the biggest response from the audience.
J.F.: Both of us got a kick out of Dolly's innocence. When she showed up the first day, she'd memorized the entire script. And then the day that Dolly sang --
L.T.: Oh, that was a glorious moment.
J.F.: She used her long nails like a washboard and started to sing, "Working 9 to 5. ..." Lily and I looked at each other and we knew: "This is it -- we've got an anthem." But I think my favorite shooting experiences were when we had the dead body in the back of the car. We went to the Apple Pan [a diner in Los Angeles] because Dolly wanted to get a cheeseburger, remember?
L.T.: Everybody would tell stories about their life, and we just fell in love with each other.
J.F.: Our worlds are so different. Our backgrounds are so different. Our senses of comedy -- I mean, I don't really have one.
L.T.: Jane was so earnest. She felt so passionate about every activist problem that she was trying to solve. It was inspiring and endearing.
J.F.: Since then, we've done seven seasons of [the Netflix TV series] "Grace and Frankie" [which ran from 2015 to 2022]. Ten days after we wrapped, we started a movie that we both like a lot called "Moving On." When that came out [in 2023], I was interested in the reviews -- almost every one of them talked about our chemistry. And it was like, "Well, maybe we should always work together." -- E.R.A.

MARC JACOBS, FASHION DESIGNER, AND CINDY SHERMAN, ARTIST Have collaborated on multiple projects for the Marc Jacobs brand, from a 2005 photo book to the spring 2024 campaign.
MARC JACOBS: In 2004, I reached out to ask if you'd [be in a Marc Jacobs campaign]. I knew your work very well, and I knew that you'd done an ad in 1984 for [the French fashion brand] Dorothée Bis. That made me think, "Maybe she'd do this with us." I was a little intimidated about asking.
CINDY SHERMAN: I was so intimidated that you'd asked. I remember thinking, "I'm going to bring a bunch of wigs and makeup." It was just me for a few shots, but then [the German photographer] Juergen [Teller] got playful and started putting himself in the pictures. He gradually shaved parts of his face and head. He'd started the shoot with a full head of hair and beard; by the end, he was completely bald with no facial hair at all.
M.J.: I wasn't there, but I got calls from Juergen saying, "It's [expletive] excellent, it's [expletive] excellent." He says that when he's really excited. You created some hilarious characters. There was one where you were both older, sitting on a bench.
C.S.: Rifling through a big bag.
M.J.: That image became a billboard on Melrose [Avenue in Los Angeles]. It was great because fashion campaigns like that didn't exist back then. Nobody would've ever said, "That's our ad," because it wasn't exactly selling clothes or bags. But it was exciting.
C.S.: What's funny is that you'd asked me, a year or two ago during Covid, to do something -- I don't even remember what it was. I'd gained a bit of weight, so I was self-conscious and kept turning you down. [For the 2024 campaign I ended up doing] some of the outfits were a little tight. The people assisting me said, "We can fix that." And I said, "No, no, it's [perfect for] the character." I guess I could've thought of someone who was trying to hide, but I decided, "No, she seems like she could just let it all hang out in her leather pants." How do you feel when you see different types of women wearing your pieces or putting them together in unusual ways?
M.J.: It's the ultimate validation. Of all the stuff that exists out there, they're spending their money on something I've made. How about you with collectors?
C.S.: Sometimes it's a little weird. I remember an early series of horizontal pictures that I called "The Centerfolds" (1981) -- I thought they were kind of disturbing, but some collector said, "I have that one hanging over my bed because it's so sexy." And I'm thinking, "Ugh, I don't want to know that." But you can't control what happens to a piece.
M.J.: Or what other people see in it. Feedback is part of the equation. It's like, "I'm not just doing this for me. I need you." -- E.R.A.

CARLOS NAZARIO, STYLIST, AND WILLY CHAVARRIA, FASHION DESIGNER Have worked together on three collections since 2022.
WILLY CHAVARRIA: Carlos and I would see each other at Calvin Klein [Nazario has styled for the brand; Chavarria was its senior vice president of design from 2021 until 2023], but our first formal meeting was lunch at the Odeon. Like Truman Capote's swans, we had salads and talked about water and weight loss.
CARLOS NAZARIO: It wasn't like we were meeting to discuss a project. That sort of evolved organically.
W.C.: I was terrified to ask you to work with me. I remember texting to [see] if you'd style my [fall 2023] show. Do you know what you said? "I thought you'd never ask."
C.N.: Willy's work spoke to me in such a profound way. There was such a similarity -- if not in aesthetic, definitely in intention. A lot of brands lack depth and a soul. I'm Afro-Latino. I grew up in New York with a certain relationship to how one presents themselves to the world, what glamour means and looks like and how it's communicated. I was always intrigued by how Willy's designs encompassed all those things.
W.C.: [The way we collaborate] is so natural and unpretentious. We end up telling a story that we feel good about.
C.N.: Every relationship between a stylist and designer is unique. Some designers require a lot more -- from research to manufacturing and the show. Others want you to come in right at the end and say, "Let's put that on this model." With Willy, our conversations prior to my first day were conceptual. We talked about what he wanted it to feel like, rather than what he wanted it to look like.
W.C.: For that first show together, we wanted the cast -- all people of color, many of them queer and trans -- to feel elevated and empowered. Marlon [Taylor-Wiles, the show's movement director] was going to have the models look down at the guests.
C.N.: At the rehearsal, we were like, "Maybe it's a bit creepy." I wasn't uncomfortable [giving my opinion] because Willy's such an easy person to talk to. But anytime you're coming into a space where everyone has clearly defined roles, you feel like a stepparent. You're a bit like, "Do I discipline the daughter? Do I tell her the skirt's too short?" I didn't want to overstep, but I also wanted to make my presence worth it. As we got more comfortable [with each other], we got more comfortable trying things.
W.C.: The next season, we took more risks. We wanted it to feel refined and elegant, but we also wanted to inject a youthfulness.
C.N.: At a lot of [brands], it's like, "This season, everything's a miniskirt. If your thighs aren't great, see you in the fall!" Willy's casting allows for a very broad vision in terms of what the styling can do: You'll have someone like me, who's 5-foot-4 [Nazario walked in the fall 2024 show], and then you'll have someone who's 6-foot-4.
W.C.: You'll have a woman in her late 50s and a 17-year-old boy.
C.N.: Everyone from twinks to daddies. If you tried to dress everyone the same, it'd be a disaster.
W.C.: I can suggest something that you don't like, and you'll say, "Let's go with it. Let's see." And I'll do the same. I've worked with stylists who will deliberate over the positioning of a hat for hours. The stress level is so intense, it kills the moment. Having the freedom [to experiment reflects] a levity we want the brand to have. You know, we address serious subjects, like human rights, inclusion ...
C.N.: Self-identity. But if we're stressed, everyone's stressed. We try to keep it light, but we also understand the weight of the responsibility. It's rare that you work with people who understand what you're feeling and what you want to convey. And I think our trust lies in that. -- N.H.

MINK STOLE, ACTRESS, AND JOHN WATERS, FILMMAKER Have worked together on almost every one of his movies since "Roman Candles" (1967), including "Pink Flamingos" (1972), "Hairspray" (1988) and "A Dirty Shame" (2004).
MINK STOLE: John, I've just been told your conference line is charging me a penny a minute.
JOHN WATERS: Oh, c'mon. I've been using it for 20 years. It's never said that.
M.S.: It's fine. I can handle it.
T: How did you two first meet?
J.W.: Mink also grew up in Baltimore, although I was friends with her older sister Mary, who now goes by Sique. My memory's that we met in Provincetown, Mass., right before doing my second movie [the 1967 short] "Roman Candles" [in which Stole plays a party guest who gets spanked]. She was looking to go bad and found the right crowd. Prescott Townsend, one of the first gay radicals, allowed us to live in a tree fort he'd made.
M.S.: That was the summer I got introduced to homosexuality.
J.W.: Did we take acid that summer?
M.S.: I kind of think we did, yeah.
J.W.: And then we took it again 50 years later. My mother always used to say, "Don't tell young people to take drugs." But I'm not -- I'm telling old people to. Anyway, we shot "Roman Candles" partly at my parents' house and, oddly enough, a decade later, you filmed a big scene at that same house, in my parents' bedroom, when you played [the delusional housewife] Peggy Gravel in "Desperate Living" [1977].
M.S.: We threw a baseball through a window and kind of trashed the place. Your mom was a sport.
J.W.: So was yours. Mink and I were arrested [along with three other members of the crew] for conspiracy to commit indecent exposure while making [the 1969 film] "Mondo Trasho." It was in the paper. They printed your poor mother's address.
M.S.: We were acquitted.
J.W.: We'd been filming a scene at Johns Hopkins University with [the actor and drag performer] Divine, in full makeup and a gold lamé top with matching toreador pants, in a 1959 red Cadillac convertible with the top down in November. I never asked permission [to shoot]. The police came and we all ran. The fact that we got caught and Divine escaped didn't say a lot for the Baltimore police. Mink played an escaped mental patient; she did a nude tap dance.
M.S.: I'd get upset when the press would call us unprofessional because, although it was true that not one of us had ever taken an acting lesson, we were incredibly professional. And none of it was ad-libbed. John wouldn't have tolerated that. He knew every comma, every "and," every "but."
J.W.: What's that French term for people who go crazy when they're together?
M.S.: "Folie à something"?
J.W.: "Folie à famille." Everybody chipped in, and we just went for it.
T: Mink, were there any scenes you refused to shoot?
M.S.: Before we started filming "Pink Flamingos" [1972, in which Stole plays the proprietor of a black-market baby ring], John very casually said, "Will you set your hair on fire?" And I said, "Yes, that'll look great on film." But then as the moment approached, I panicked.
J.W.: I was on pot when I thought of that.
M.S.: It would've been great, except that I'd be bald today. I think that's the only thing I ever refused to do.
T: What've you learned from each other?
M.S.: In the early films, we all acted largely. We spoke in italics. In the later ones, when I'd start to behave that way, John would say, "Take it down." I was shocked [the first time he said it].
J.W.: When we made those early movies, I was influenced by the theater of the ridiculous -- by cruelty, shouting and craziness. It wasn't them overacting, it was me telling them to overact.
M.S.: I have enormous respect for John, and John for me. Aside from the fact that I love him dearly, I don't know where I'd be if I hadn't met him.
J.W.: And we've never had the same boyfriend.
M.S.: Or wanted the same boyfriend.
J.W.: Mink and I have been through a lot together. We've fought, we've made up. I don't trust people who don't have old friends. For me, they outlast family. Mink and I are even going to be buried together in the same graveyard. We call it Disgraceland. -- N.H.

COBY KENNEDY AND HANK WILLIS THOMAS, ARTISTS Have spent three decades collaborating on public art installations and community-focused projects, including 2023's "Reach," a more than 2,700-pound fiberglass-and-resin sculpture at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport of two hands nearly touching.
COBY KENNEDY: We met on a collaboration, actually. It was the summer of 1992.
HANK WILLIS THOMAS: I'd been recruited to work with Coby to renovate the darkroom at Howard University [in Washington, D.C.], where his father [Winston Kennedy] was the chair of the art program. We were in high school. Building a darkroom when you don't really know how -- that's kind of the way we've always worked. Back then, Coby was a street writer.
C.K.: A graffiti writer, in the parlance of our times. My graffiti and school crews melded into this conglomerate [called] the Earthbound Homies.
H.W.T.: This was [during the] peak '90s hip-hop days. The group was [made up of] all these young, primarily Black artists. I wasn't one of them, I was a documenter.
C.K.: Hank was in museum studies, while the rest of us were in visual arts. He was very quiet and observant. It felt like he was always regarding you.
H.W.T.: The core of our relationship has been fostering opportunities for others to interlace their practices. The Wide Awakes [their most recent art collective, named after a progressive group that supported Abraham Lincoln during the 1860 presidential election] took off in my old studio in December 2019.
C.K.: We were trying to plug into society and see how we could influence it. When 2020 happened -- the pandemic, the lockdown, the insurrection -- we really hit the accelerator with it.
H.W.T.: I'd call the Wide Awakes our first public collaboration. But then again, 2016 is when "Reach" [their sculpture at Chicago's O'Hare airport] first started. We're excited to have it be one of the largest public acknowledgments of something we've been doing for 30 years.
C.K.: In our collaborations, we kind of fill in each other's gaps.
H.W.T.: As a conceptual artist, I have great ideas -- a lot of them. Coby, who has a history as an industrial designer and animator, is the bridge between the proposal and how it happens. With virtually every one of my public sculptures, he's done all the initial concepting. He's always had this ability to see what others are thinking. We also have different tastes.
C.K.: And they're sometimes at odds with each other, which is one of the best parts [of our working relationship], because I'd hate for both of us to be middle ground.
H.W.T.: Coby has a very clear, singular vision, while I create art through consensus. I want to make a statement [so I'm often asking others], "What do you think about it?" I envy Coby's talent. But I also think not having his talent gives me a reliance on other people, which is helpful in the context of making public art.
C.K.: I know that he'll tell me the truth about anything I come up with, and he knows that if I have to talk trash about one of his ideas, I'll talk trash about it.
H.W.T.: As much as I'd like Coby to think like me, then he wouldn't be him and I wouldn't be me. We allow each other to be who we are. -- N.A.
INGAR DRAGSET AND MICHAEL ELMGREEN, ARTISTS Have worked as the duo Elmgreen & Dragset on more than 90 solo shows and site-specific installations, including a 2005 replica of a Prada store near Marfa, Texas, since 1995.
INGAR DRAGSET: We met at After Dark, the only gay club at the time in Copenhagen, in 1994. I was 24 and Michael was 32. I thought he looked amazing -- he had this Dennis Rodman-style hair that was bleached with baroque black patterns on it. We both had big Dr. Martens boots and were much grungier than the rest of the crowd.
MICHAEL ELMGREEN: The club was a classic disco -- a lot of blown-out hair and Gloria Gaynor. It wasn't difficult to spot each other.
I.D.: We got more than a little tipsy. When we both started to walk home, we realized that we lived not only in the same neighborhood but in the same building. That was the beginning of our 10-year romantic relationship. The artistic collaboration started eight months later, a little bit by accident. I was doing theater at the time.
M.E.: I was writing poetry and experimenting with texts that would morph in front of people's eyes on IBM computers. To my surprise, I was considered a visual artist.
I.D.: Michael got invited to do an exhibition in Stockholm. He had the idea of creating abstract pets that people could cuddle, but he didn't know how to make them. And I said, "Well, I'm good at knitting." So that's how the collaboration started.
M.E.: The Swedes are, as we know, a bit stiff; they were terrified about interacting with the artwork. So we were sitting in [opposite] corners with these knitted pets, cuddling them, and people thought it was a performance.
I.D.: That accidental performance inspired us to do more. The next one was a piece where I was furiously knitting at one end of a very long white cloth while Michael was unraveling everything from the other end. That should tell you a bit about our partnership.
M.E.: When we were coupled, we were almost the same size in clothes, so we even shared socks, we shared bank accounts, all our friends.
I.D.: We had one email account, one cellphone.
M.E.: Starting a new chapter after we split up was like meeting again, workwise. We had separate lives for some hours of the day. Suddenly, you could bring in exciting things that the other hadn't experienced.
I.D.: It was a very difficult time. We put most things on hold, but we had one exhibition that would've been hard to cancel: a solo show at Tate Modern [in London]. In a big room with a window overlooking the Thames, we added another windowpane and, in between the panes, we had an animatronic but very realistic-looking sparrow that seemed to be gasping for life and flapping its wings, and nobody could help it.
M.E.: I think the beauty of it all was that we dared to stop being boyfriends because we knew we wouldn't lose each other. Today, it'd be impossible to say who came up with what idea. It's not two half authorships. It's like this imaginary third persona in between us that we feed -- an invisible genius kid who's much, much younger, brighter and more charming than either of us. He's creating the artworks. -- J.H.
BOBBI SALVÖR MENUEZ, ACTOR, AND MICHAEL BAILEY-GATES, ARTIST Have collaborated on dozens of performances and photography projects throughout their decade-long friendship.
BOBBI SALVÖR MENUEZ: I curated a 2014 show at [the Brooklyn exhibition space] Muddguts that was part of a series in which I invited people who didn't always make performance work to create something in a performance context. We'd been in a group show together before and had mutual friends, and I was excited about the work I was seeing Michael make.
MICHAEL BAILEY-GATES: It was me, Bobbi and maybe two or three other people. I had this party trick of being able to talk really fast, like an auctioneer. When I said certain phrases, one of them would stand up, and another would scream at the top of their lungs or throw an object at someone.
B.S.M.: It felt like the beginning of us making things together on the fly. We both had this down-to-get-into-it energy that was well matched.
M.B.G.: We shared an urgency to make work come to life. Sometimes it's as simple as being a body for another person. I've been the lead in Bobbi's performances, and I've been in the background, lying on a floor covered in red paint. Performance art in New York at the time was about executing an idea without a lot of money. These days, I don't go into a shoot thinking we're performing, but it's very much that: The camera is the audience looking back at us.
B.S.M.: Michael has this ability to see the kaleidoscopic possibility of someone's self- expression. Around 2018, I was out as nonbinary to my close friends and finding my new name. I took a break from auditions and started working part-time as a substitute teacher. When a film I'd shot the year before got into [the 2019] Sundance [Film Festival], it was an invitation to step back into the spotlight. I'd shaved my head and was nervous about that formal, public coming- out moment. It just felt so cringe. I went to Los Angeles before going to Sundance and made some pictures with Michael that were only for us. Those were the first images of Bobbi that entered the world.
M.B.G.: I never want to make a picture of somebody that's not reflective of them. I've chosen in my practice to always focus on a small group of friends, and those collaborations are the grounding force of my work. Without them, what would my pictures be? They'd be something less precious. -- C.R.

Boat Shoes Establish a Foothold Among the Fashionable: [Style Desk]

Full text: The category of footwear created when Franklin D. Roosevelt was president is being reinterpreted and rediscovered.
Sometimes fashion just seems like "Groundhog Day" with better outfits. Designers vanish only to reappear suddenly (looking at you, Alessandro Michele). Trends sputter out and abruptly are back. Skinny jeans were cool until everyone was wearing oversize drop-crotch khakis -- everyone, that is, except that cadre of teen style-setters intent on bringing back 2000s-era jeggings so bad they're good.
Consider, in this vein, the boat shoe, echt signifier of all things preppy. All but defunct as an element of a stylish wardrobe, it has now become a hot item. This is "the year of the boat shoe," says Vogue, which is far from alone in observing a proliferation of fashionable maritime footwear.
There they were on the Miu Miu spring 2024 runway in Paris, in what was widely considered one of Miuccia Prada's best collections for that label in years. There, too, they were at Fendi's fall 2024 men's wear show in Milan, where the moccasin-style shoe had been stamped to look like crocodile. There they are on virtually every page of a new catalog from the revived hipster heritage brand Quaker Marine Supply Co., a label whose style paragon is not Jacob Elordi but "Papa" Hemingway.
"Every few years there's another wave," Lisa Birnbach, 65, the author of "The Official Preppy Handbook" and its sequel "True Prep," said of boat shoes like Sperry Top-Siders or the similarly beloved, if nautically inappropriate, L.L. Bean Camp Moccasins (they scuff decks).
Ms. Birnbach's "Handbook," originally published in 1980 as a satirical take on upper-class folkways, went on to become a canonical text, right up there with "Take Ivy," a slender volume of photographs from 1965 depicting long-ago Ivy League guys. Both are inevitably cited whenever preppy trends cycle through again. And each time that happens, Ms. Birnbach knows her phone will ring. "My telephone number must be on the bathroom wall at Condé Nast and Hearst," she said on a call from her home north of Los Angeles.
The renewed interest in boat shoes could be inspired, Ms. Birnbach said, "by a new retailer selling Top-Siders, a designer that discovers them, an Instagram or TikTok person that puts themselves together with boat shoes in a clever way." Regardless, she said, it always seems as if people are seeing them for the first time, which is odd for a category of footwear created when Franklin D. Roosevelt was president.
It was in 1935 that Paul Sperry, the inventor of Sperry Top-Siders, is said to have slipped on the deck of his sailboat and fallen overboard into the Long Island Sound. He later experienced a soggy epiphany, out of which came a shoe for boating with simple leather uppers and incised rubber soles that mimicked the ridges on his cocker spaniel's paws. (Mr. Sperry patented the process of making those grooves, termed "siping," in 1937.)
The Top-Sider is "the Platonic ideal of the shoe," said Jason Jules, the author of "Black Ivy," a 2021 book examining how generations of Black men adopted, improvised upon and made their own the elements of a sartorial code that originated among a largely white Ivy League elite.
"The sudden re-emergence of the boat shoe in fashion is partly a reaction to sneaker fatigue," Mr. Jules, 60, said on a call from his home in Paraguay. "With sneakers, you're so overwhelmed by details that you need a manual to know how to wear them."
Conversely, as any yachtie can testify, Top-Siders are so elementary in their design they barely qualify as a shoe. And though the style has been reinterpreted in pop colorways, metallics and subject to cool designer affiliations (most notably a fashion-bro-friendly collaboration with Chris Echevarria of Blackstock & Weber), it is the classic version that continues to resonate.
"It's the style iconography," said Jonathan Frankel, the president of the Aldo Group, whose portfolio includes Sperry. "It ain't broke, so don't fix it."'
On a recent phone call from his company's headquarters in Florence, Ala., the designer Billy Reid, 59, noted that he'd bought his first pair of Top-Siders at 15 and then "wore them until they were held together with duct tape and Shoe Goo." Now, he said, seeing 20-somethings wearing Top-Siders "blows my mind."
Though Mr. Reid replaced his boat shoes with some regularity through the years, eventually he consigned them to the back of his closet. And there they remained until "my 20-year-old son, Walton, started stealing them."
Therein lies the paradox of the boat shoe, according to Kevin McLaughlin, the owner of Quaker Marine. Styles like Top-Siders are rooted in function, not fashion. Yet they are "simultaneously always coming into fashion again," he said.
For Walton Reid, Mr. Reid's 20-year-old son and a musician, the anti-fashion vibe of a boat shoe is intrinsic to its appeal.
"The way style works now, you can take inspiration from a utilitarian classic and put whatever spin on it you want," he said. "I can walk into a thrift store, find a pair of Dior jeans somebody may have died in, wear them with a suit jacket and boat shoes and, even though it shouldn't work, it does."

Full text: I am going to an eclipse watching party, but aside from the viewing glasses, which I already have, what should I wear? Dressing in theme seems silly, but I want to acknowledge the event.
Susan, Rochester, N.Y. It's human instinct, when celebrating a total solar eclipse -- a magical moment of real darkness in the middle of the afternoon -- to want to dress for the occasion. It's a way of marking its importance and making a memory, along with uttering cool phrases like "the path of totality."
So how best to do it today? Obviously, protective eyewear is the most important accessory. Otherwise, some unexpected fashion advice comes from scientists, who suggest wearing red and green. Those colors are generally associated with a different time of year and event, but apparently they are also a lot of fun to wear during a total eclipse, thanks to something called the Purkinje effect.
Discovered in 1819 by the Czech anatomist Jan Evangelista Purkinje, the Purkinje effect refers to the way the cones and rods in the eye process light. When the light changes very quickly -- like during an eclipse! -- the reds get darker, and the greens become bright. So if you are outside during totality, you and those around you will also have fun checking out your magically morphing outfit.
Beyond that, there is ... well, a galaxy's worth of options. Though the presence of starship-inspired clothing has ebbed and flowed over time, what has been called "retro-Galactica" and "neo space age" has been on an upswing of late, perhaps because of NASA's plans to return to the moon. Or because of the obsession of titans like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk with the final frontier. Or even Zendaya's "Dune: Part II" promotion outfits, all that silver in Beyoncé's Renaissance tour and a general dissatisfaction with the planet we are on now.
When the national interest, moguls and pop culture mesh, powerful trends tend to emerge. To cite two examples: Prada is collaborating with Axiom Space, the private company making NASA's astronaut uniforms for the Artemis III mission. Christian Cowan worked with Adobe to create a dress at New York Fashion Week that was made of what looked like scales but turned out to be lots of tiny screens programmed to change colors and patterns at will.
Those garments are, of course, not available for purchase, but there are plenty of interstellar-ish alternatives. You may even have some in your wardrobe already. Think silver, transparency and sculptural white, fashion ingredients that have been shorthand for the space age since André Courrèges and Paco Rabanne first put lunar looks on the runway. Remember, you are likely to be outside, so certain practical considerations would not be out of place. But no matter what you wear, when the sun and the moon meet, that will be the most mind-blowing look of all.

Full text: The Unstoppables is a series about people whose ambition is undimmed by time. Below, Betye Saar explains, in her own words, what continues to motivate her.
Being raised during the Depression, we all learned to be creative with what we had on hand. At Christmas or on my birthday, I always got art supplies, and I was jealous that my siblings got bikes and stuff. I realize now that my parents were fostering my creativity.
An early influence on my becoming an artist was Simon Rodia. My grandmother lived in Watts, and we would walk by the Watts Towers when they were being built. I was fascinated by how he used bottle caps and corn cobs and broken plates -- trash, essentially -- to make art, to make something beautiful. Then, much later, in the 1960s, I saw the work of Joseph Cornell. He refined the use of found objects and materials and boxes, and I thought, "Wow, I've kind of been doing that, too." I didn't know it was called assemblage, but it made sense to me and set me in that direction as an artist.
The main challenge, I guess, to being an artist is how to make a living. But being a creative person means you have to find ways to do this. I studied design at U.C.L.A., and after I graduated, I made greeting cards, I made jewelry, I got into printmaking and then sold my prints. I taught art classes in colleges all over the states. My creativity kept evolving with my needs as I got married and bought a house, had my daughters and put them through college. Through it all, I loved making art. It kept me going.
I still want to make art. Sometimes in the morning when I wake up, it's hard to get out of bed, hard to get back into my body and get it to move. But I do it. Not everyone has a reason to get out of bed, something they love to do and that gives their life meaning. I am so lucky that I have that as part of my life. I don't really think about my age, unless someone mentions it, though I guess I feel middle-aged -- which for me is, like, 50 to 70. It would be kind of neat to live to 100, to have 100 revolutions around the sun. I'm pretty close.
Current and upcoming projects: Completed "Drifting Toward Twilight," an installation at the Huntington Library in San Marino, Calif.; "Betye Saar: Heart of a Wanderer" exhibition at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston; "Betye Saar: Serious Moonlight" at the Kunstmuseum in Lucerne, Switzerland; and completed a newly commissioned artwork for "Paraventi; Folding Screens from the 17th to the 21st Century" at the Fondazione Prada in Milan.

What does ambition look like at 90? How do you explain the drive that makes people like Giorgio Armani, fully in command of his global design empire as he approaches his 10th decade, tick? When artist Betye Saar wakes every day, she sets to work on creating the assemblages that are widely exhibited and avidly sought by collectors and major museums — artworks with origins she traces to her girlhood in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, during the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Why bother? Wasn’t retirement supposed to be the goal of a contented old age? Didn’t the plan call for taking up needlepoint or golf? The old, as it happens, represent a rapidly growing global population: The proportion of those 65 and above is increasing at a faster rate than those below that age, according to World Population Prospects, a United Nations study. Between 2022, when the report was issued, and 2050, the global population of those over 65 is expected to rise to 16% from 10%. People are already working longer, and, as they do, it would appear that a road map is needed, a means of understanding what keeps people like Martha Stewart not only undiminished by age but actively in the game.
Over the past months, we asked what makes people like Stewart so seemingly unstoppable. Is there an explanation for why, besides prosperity and good health, some people are driven to chase their dreams long past the age when recent history suggests we were meant to be kicking back in our rocking chairs?
The Unstoppables is a series about people whose ambition is undimmed by time. All interviews have been edited and condensed.
— Martha Stewart, 82, Has ‘Never-Ending Curiosity’ (And a Few Regrets).
This year I made time to grow the best vegetables, monster vegetables, that I’ve ever grown in my life. My houses are never done. And I’m writing my autobiography. That’s the scariest project for me because I don’t really like everything about myself — where I’ve been, what I’ve done.
I get up at 6:30 every morning. My housekeeper comes at 7, and I can’t be in bed when she arrives. That would be very embarrassing. I’m a bad sleeper, in any case. At times I’d rather watch a documentary. Other times, I might be anxious, not for me but for my grandchildren. If I wake in the night, I read the headlines to make sure we’re not being bombed.
Maybe a little uncertainty can help fuel ambition. When I left my job on Wall Street, I knew I had to create a career for myself. I became a caterer, catering parties every night. Still I thought, “Will there come a time when my granddaughter — she’s 12 — is asked, “What did grandma do?” And all she can say is “Oh, she made parties for people.” I thought, “I have to do something more than this.” That was in the 1980s, when I wrote my first book, the one on entertaining.
At that time I wasn’t keeping my eye on the home, even though I was known as a homemaker. It wasn’t enough for a marriage. Maybe I regret not having had more children. Maybe I regret that my marriage ended abruptly. We’d been together 27 years. That used to be considered a long time, so when a long marriage ended, it was like somebody died. Maybe I would have liked getting married again. I didn’t, but I don’t mind. Still, I’m curious about what could have been.
My never-ending curiosity drives me. Will it stop? That’s never even occurred to me.
Current and upcoming projects : Autobiography in progress; an untitled Martha Stewart documentary from R.J. Cutler, who directed “The September Issue,” to stream on Netflix in 2024; a PBS documentary series, “Hope In the Water,” set for broadcast in 2024; a partnership with Samsung for a 2023-24 advertising campaign; a line of gardening clothes and accessories in collaboration with French Dressing Jeans and Marquee Brands.

Not everyone has a reason to get out of bed, something they love to do and that gives their life meaning. I am so lucky that I have that as part of my life. I don’t really think about my age, unless someone mentions it, though I guess I feel middle-aged — which for me is, like, 50 to 70. It would be kind of neat to live to 100, to have 100 revolutions around the sun. I’m pretty close.

— GUY TREBAY Joan Collins, 90, Refuses to Be Defined by Age
I love writing; I love acting, going onstage and doing my little one-woman show; and I refuse to be defined by a number, by an age. I think that’s terribly old-fashioned and not relevant in today’s world.
But you have to be resilient in this business. Rejection is a part of it. I look with dismay at so many of my fellow actors, fallen by the way because of drink and drugs. My father — he was a theatrical agent — instilled in me that I should develop skin like a rhinoceros and be like a marshmallow on the inside.
You also need patience. This business is a waiting game. For example, a script was written for me about the Duchess of Windsor [Wallis Simpson]. I’ve been wanting to do it since the 1980s. We got a green light only a month ago. Years ago I thought it would be wonderful to do a picture about growing up with my sister, Jackie. It just hasn’t come off.
It would be set when we were children, during the Blitz. At the time I didn’t feel fear. I didn’t know about the bombings. We would pick up shrapnel in the streets, and in the evening I would put it in my cigar box. We would draw silly pictures of Hitler. We were evacuated 10 or 12 times. We would be in the tube stations, and people would be playing their harmonicas and singing.
A question I’m often asked is, “Why are you still working?” It’s such a fatuous thing to say. I keep on working because I love being busy. It’s tiring when I do my one-woman show, going to a new hotel every night. But it’s rewarding. The audience is so responsive. That buoys me.
Current and upcoming projects : “Behind the Shoulder Pads, Tales I Tell My Friends,” a memoir; “Joan Collins Unscripted,” a British theatrical tour.
— RUTH LA FERLA Giorgio Armani, 89, Doesn’t Think Much About Age
For those of us who grew up in the shadow of war, ambition was something natural, a vital drive. It was not so much a desire for fame and notoriety but rather an urge for personal fulfillment, a way to assert oneself outside the hardship and to overcome it. My mother and father taught me the value of commitment and hard work to get things done. It is a lesson that has never left me.
It took me some time to find my way. First, I studied medicine, then came La Rinascente [an Italian department store, where Armani worked in display] and Cerruti — fashion, in other words. That was the moment when I found my ambition, when I discovered the power of clothes not only to change the way you look but, more profoundly, to influence the way you are and behave.
I think the challenges — or problems — and the rewards of staying in the game go hand in hand if you do this work for as long as I have and if you remain present. The main pressure is staying relevant without giving in to the pressures of the moment, which often feel very urgent but are forgettable in the long run.
In truth, I don’t think about age much. In my head, I am the same age I was when I started Giorgio Armani. Situations and people change, but the challenges and problems are all the same in the end. My way of tackling them hasn’t changed — with great determination. Audiences evolve, however, and this cannot be underestimated. Stylistic coherence, therefore, must be elastic. Otherwise one becomes rigid. The ultimate gratification is to become a classic — outside of and above fashion — and to be identified with a style.

Full text: Did Presidents Biden, Obama and Clinton, appearing together at a fund-raiser in open-neck shirts, look casual or 'a little disheveled'?
Simultaneously historic and perhaps a big nothing, the shot was snapped on Thursday in New York City when President Biden and former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton gathered, before a Democratic fund-raiser, for the taping of "SmartLess," a podcast hosted by the comedians Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes and Will Arnett.
With his beard and rumpled corduroy pants, Mr. Bateman was clearly the odd man out in a group of radiantly healthy alphas dressed in crisp blazers or suits. As one social media quipster put it, Mr. Bateman, the "Arrested Development" star who is soon to appear in a limited series with Jude Law, looked as if he was celebrating his release from the hoosegow. The other dudes were on hand to help cut the cake.
It was not Mr. Bateman, though, who generated online buzz with his attire. It was those three presidents appearing without ties. (Messrs. Arnett and Hayes also skipped the neckwear, and as it happened, the three presidents remained without ties straight through the evening's event.) Were we once again at the precipice, as some commentators seemed to suggest? Was civilization nearing its end? Or were we yet again being reminded of the inexorable march from casual Friday to casual everyday, and to a world in which chief executives dress like field hands and the only people who can be relied on to sport a suit and tie outside a courtroom are bodyguards and limo chauffeurs?
Pity the poor tie. Pundits are forever writing its obit. Back in 2022, the doomsayers piled on when, at a G7 summit in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, world leaders including Justin Trudeau, Emmanuel Macron and Boris Johnson "declared the end of the necktie," according to Women's Wear Daily, by posing for a group photo in suits and open-neck shirts.
Women's Wear Daily, citing the pandemic and the corresponding boom in athleisure and active wear, noted that the formal suit -- with that sadly diminished phallic accessory, the necktie -- "no longer yields the intellect and vim it once did."
Just as with Mark Twain, reports of the necktie's demise have been greatly exaggerated. Not only is it debatable whether, as a New York Times newsletter asserted last year, "neckties have been out of fashion for so long that even articles about neckties being out of fashion have gone out of fashion," but they have in truth enjoyed a robust resurgence.
For proof, check out the recent runways of New York, Milan or Paris and collections produced by industry leaders like Prada, Gucci and Armani. Scan the style blogs or the pages of GQ, Esquire or L'Uomo Vogue and you will quickly conclude that the issue is not whether the necktie is dead but how politicians' stylists fell so badly behind the curve.
For presidents or anyone else with "some stature in the suit game, the tie is the thing that finishes it off," said Jim Moore, the creative director at large of GQ, who once persuaded Mr. Obama to change the tie he was wearing for a magazine feature. "We love to dress the suit down, but, in the end, respect the suit and wear the tie."
Failing to do so is, he said, "a bit of a lame attempt." -- to have one's cake and eat it, too.
For Colm Dillane, the founder of the New York cult label KidSuper, best known for its streetwear, functionality is not the point of a tie. "It's not much more than a neck belt," he said. Still, in terms of symbolic value, a tie "does a ton."
The politicians who gathered tieless for the photo this week looked less casual and relaxed than "a little disheveled," Mr. Dillane said. That's something his coaches would never have condoned back when he played soccer at New York University.
"Whenever we traveled, we had to put on a coat and tie for the plane," he said. "It wasn't that comfortable, obviously, but it showed that we took whatever we were doing seriously -- that this was a bigger deal than just practice."

Where Are Men Buying Suits Off the Rack?: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When The New York Times heard from 81 men who responded to a survey about off-the-rack suits they had bought since 2021, the style that came up the most was introduced around the time Barack Obama was first elected president: J. Crew's Ludlow suit.
The Ludlow suit, which has been offered in various colors and fabrics, has a slim fit and starts at about $ 675. After its introduction in 2008, the Ludlow became "instantly omnipresent," according to GQ. The Wall Street Journal said the suit "changed the way we dressed." Guy Trebay, the men's fashion critic at The Times, wrote that the style "transformed our relationship to suiting."
Most survey respondents who mentioned the Ludlow suit said that they owned more than one version. Steve Zegans, 45, a content strategist in New York, owns two. He described the style as "refined and classic."
Steven Rojas, the director of marketing at the Twenty Two, a hotel in New York, owns four. Mr. Rojas, 42, also has suits from Sandro, Dior and Thom Browne, he said, but he has gotten more use out of his Ludlow suits because the style strikes a balance between contemporary and classic. It is, as he put it, "versatile enough for both professional settings and the dance floor."
To get a sense of how male shoppers are navigating the off-the-rack-suit landscape, The Times reached out to more than 1,400 men between the ages of 20 and 80 from across the United States last summer and fall. (Off-the-rack, for this article, meant a suit bought online or at a store that fit a person's body with minimal or no alterations.)
Some men were approached as they commuted to and from Grand Central Terminal in New York, and others while they were getting lunch near Wall Street. Certain professionals -- lawyers, doctors, executives -- were sought out because their occupations often require formal dress. Some were also approached on Instagram after a search for users who had recently posted about weddings or events where they had worn suits.
While the almost seven dozen responses to the survey show that the Ludlow suit hasn't lost its appeal, they also show that men have found other worthy off-the-rack options.
Ahead are more suits cited by survey participants, along with some shopping trends observed in their answers.
Suits from Sid Mashburn and SuitSupply also came up many times.
SuitSupply's Havana suit, another slim-cut style, was cited by three men in their 30s. It has a classic look, they said, and is something they could see themselves wearing for years. The suit starts at about $ 500, is offered in various fabrics and comes in three-piece versions.
Herman Singh, 32, a manager at a financial services company in New York, said that he cares more about a suit's fit than its material and that "SuitSupply seems to put a lot of emphasis on how their suits fit."
Cody Romness, 33, a founder of Allegiate Gym, which has locations in Los Angeles, liked that suits from SuitSupply can be customized. The personalizations, some of which are free, include choosing options for jacket linings or lapel styles.
Sid Mashburn's Kincaid No. 3 Suit is, according to Andrew Favorito, a 31-year-old fashion and beauty public relations director in New York, "many steps up from the J. Crew starter suit" that he owns.
Russell Kelly, 49, the chief operating officer at Fourtané Jewelers in Carmel, Calif., also has the style, which costs $ 1,695 and is offered in a handful of colors.
Mr. Kelly said the suit's higher price reflects its materials and construction. "I've had many custom suits made over the years," he said. "I prefer these suits over any bespoke clothing I have."
J. Crew's Crosby and Kenmare suits are less slim Ludlow alternatives.
The Kenmare suit came up as an alternative to the Ludlow, particularly for those wanting a J. Crew style that Ryan Cascarano, 29, an environmental consultant in Chicago, described as "more relaxed and less on the slim side." He would know: He already owned a Ludlow when he bought a Kenmare.
Starting at about $ 650, the Kenmare is a bit lower in price than the Ludlow, and it is offered in far fewer versions. It was introduced in 2022, well after many people started opting for wide pants instead of slimmer styles (and started wearing looser-fitting clothes in general). Mr. Cascarano said the Kenmare has a polished look that is not dissimilar to suits he has admired in Wes Anderson films.
J. Crew's Crosby suit, a style introduced in 2014, came up as another not-as-slim option. (J. Crew describes the Crosby suit's fit as "classic" and the Kenmare's as "laid back.") The Crosby is offered in more versions than the Kenmare but fewer than the Ludlow, and starts at about $ 675.
Picky about fabric? Try Todd Snyder.
Todd Snyder was the executive vice president of men's wear at J. Crew when the Ludlow suit was created. Mr. Snyder started his namesake label a few years later, and its suits were cited by survey respondents in their 30s, 40s and 50s. The currently available styles start at about $ 750.
Many of the men who mentioned the brand's suits brought up the fabrics. Bob Gearing, 42, a sales manager at a cybersecurity company in New York, said his Todd Snyder suit was made with a breathable denim-like material and described it as an upgrade to the "standard" styles sold by J. Crew. (He owns suits from both brands.)
Ross Cassidy, 43, an architect and a furniture designer in Los Angeles, said that Todd Snyder suits generally look modern -- but not so modern that they feel trendy. "I hate anything trendy," Mr. Cassidy said.
Gen Z-ers and young millennials are gravitating toward double-breasted jackets.
Ten survey respondents in their 20s and early 30s said they had recently bought a double-breasted suit, and many of them chose the style for its "personality."
Daniel Wisner, 31, a jewelry designer in New York, bought his from Stoffa, a men's wear brand whose fans include the hosts of the fashion podcast "Throwing Fits." (Stoffa's currently available double-breasted jackets start at $ 1,500.)
At first Mr. Wisner saw double-breasted suits as being for "older men with banking jobs," but he has come to see them as "the opposite of stuffy." He said of his suit: "The double breast makes it more formal, but the cut is so relaxed that it's the perfect mix."
Respondents also mentioned double-breasted suits from Men's Wearhouse, Tom Ford and Selected, a Danish label.
When browsing for suits, these are 11 more brands to remember.
Other suits that came up in the survey were from the following labels, listed in no particular order: Paul Stuart, Express, Ring Jacket, Alex Mill, Indochino, Ted Baker, Proper Cloth, Prada, Brooks Brothers, Joseph A. Bank and Maison Margiela.

A Makeover for an Ugly Situation: [Style Desk]

Full text: The recent history of John Galliano, Dolce & Gabbana and even Ye suggests the answer may be yes.
""High & Low: John Galliano," the feature-length documentary about the former Dior designer's fall from grace after a drunken antisemitic rant in a Paris bar in 2011, and his long climb back, is interesting for a number of reasons. It is a chance to hear from Mr. Galliano himself about his struggles, for one, and to look back at the fashion world of the 1990s. But just as striking is the number of think pieces it has spawned meditating on Mr. Galliano's transgressions, repentance and, it seems, current state of forgiveness.
Indeed, the film's greatest significance may have less to do with the story it tells than with what it seems to represent: the official end of Mr. Galliano's time in the wilderness. It serves as a coda to a period that began with his firing from Dior and subsequent conviction for hate crimes and that lasted through a prolonged period of atonement and a new job at Maison Margiela, where Mr. Galliano's work is once again being celebrated.
As such, it also reflects a shift away from the era of outrage, particularly in fashion. "It does seem like, in the end, everyone is allowed back in," said Achim Berg, a former lead of McKinsey & Company's global apparel, fashion and luxury group.
Though individuals in other industries have been canceled and have returned to public life -- Aziz Ansari and Louis C.K. spring to mind -- fashion is unique in the way it uses people to humanize brands, meaning their actions are intrinsically connected to the fortunes of a much larger company, as are their creations.
Perhaps the only equivalent is the restaurant world, though designers and celebrities generally have higher name recognition than even the most famous chefs, and the financial implications are significantly greater. As a result, it is possible that in this case, as with many trends, whither fashion, whither the culture. Or vice versa.
After all, beyond Mr. Galliano, a brief list of the once-disgraced-now-re-emerging includes:
Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, who was broadly excoriated and lost his corporate deals after his own racist and antisemitic statements in 2022. Last month, however, Ye appeared in the front row at the Marni show, and he is currently featured in Y/Project's 10th-anniversary lookbook, along with Charli XCX and Tyga. Adidas, despite ending its official relationship with him, continues to promote and sell its Yeezy stock.
Balenciaga, which was inundated by a social media mob in 2022 after a poorly judged holiday ad campaign caused some people to allege that the brand was promoting child pornography. Now it not only has the stamp of approval of brand ambassadors Kim Kardashian (formerly a fan of the brand who distanced herself after the controversy but has very publicly returned to the fold), Nicole Kidman and Michelle Yeoh, but has found new momentum after a highly praised recent show, which shrugged off the hair shirt of atonement for high-octane statement-making.
Dolce & Gabbana, which suffered a fall from grace in 2018, when it appeared to offend all of China with an ad campaign that trafficked in racial stereotype, and which was preceded by numerous slurs about size and sexual orientation. In 2022, the brand not only appeared to sponsor an entire Kardashian wedding but also collaborated with Kim, and recently has been ubiquitous on the red carpet. Both Usher and Alicia Keys wore the brand for their performance at the Super Bowl, watched by 123.7 million viewers.
Marchesa, founded by Georgina Chapman, the former wife of Harvey Weinstein, which went quiet in the immediate aftermath of the exposure of Mr. Weinstein's criminal actions, but has once more become an awards show go-to for the likes of Hannah Waddingham and Padma Lakshmi.
Alexander Wang, who was accused of sexual misconduct in 2021, then settled a lawsuit and held a show last year attended by the great and good of New York and Los Angeles.
Theories of Relativity
It's easy to dismiss fashion's fickleness as a product of its superficiality -- this is, after all, an industry predicated on pushing change almost every four months -- but something more complicated and meaningful may be going on.
"I think it's directly correlated with the industry's current obsession with discretion and propriety -- its nonconfrontational nature and risk aversion," said Gabriella Karefa-Johnson, the stylist and activist, nodding to the tendency in fashion to play it safe in the face of an uncertain economic and political climate -- to revert to the known (white male designers with the same facial hair, for example), even if the known has some skeletons in its closet.
Mr. Berg said that perhaps it was simply a question of proportion. There are so many tensions in the world at the moment, with so many enormous implications, that everything else seems less serious in comparison. Also, he said, "After the last American election, all parameters about what is and what is not acceptable have changed" -- and not just in fashion. In his view, cancel culture itself may have been a phenomenon of the Covid era.
"We may be experiencing a degree of outrage fatigue," said Susan Scafidi, the founder of the Fashion Law Institute at Fordham University. "With waves of scandal, the first is the worst, but every apology that we collectively accept lessens the drama of the next incident."
This is especially true when the actions being apologized for vary so widely, from sexual assault to hate crimes to racial slurs to guilt by association -- and from actual crimes that can, and sometimes are, prosecuted in a court of law to crimes in the court of public opinion.
And yet, as Julie Zerbo, the founder of The Fashion Law website, pointed out, the details and severity of the offense may differ, but the story lines are broadly the same. They start with an online outcry, followed by an apology, a retreat to "focus on the work" (or some such), a fallow period and then a re-emergence, chastened but accepted. That pattern has become so predictable, it is almost rote. And it encourages a tendency to see all of the cases as the same, to conflate the most serious with the least.
Especially because transgressions look less shocking the further they recede in the rearview mirror, or the more they are replaced by new ones. In a world of shortened attention spans, people can pay attention to only so much wrongdoing at once.
It is perhaps not an accident that the founders of Diet Prada, the Instagram fashion watchdog account that rose to prominence on its willingness to call out wrongdoing, declined to comment for this article and have pivoted toward broader reporting on fashion.
Crime and Punishment
Is there anything that is not forgivable? "For those who don't regain their former status -- Anand Jon and Harvey Weinstein come to mind -- a key reason is that their transgressions are so serious that the justice system intervenes," Ms. Scafidi said.
It's also worth noting that, as Ms. Zerbo said, what happens in the echo chamber of, say, fashion X and what the global consumer knows can be different. Balenciaga never experienced the same blowback in Asia that it did in the West. And while celebrities were chary of Dolce & Gabbana for a few months after the China blowup, they soon came around when red carpets (and free trips to Italy for the couture extravaganza) beckoned.
"None of these people were ever actually canceled," Ms. Karefa-Johnson said. They were simply moved out of the spotlight. "Eventually enough time passes that the canceled can uncancel themselves -- through their work, or their lingering 'genius,' or their moneymaking potential or their social capital that never fully depreciated," she said.
For Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue, who was instrumental in the return of at least three of the canceled designers -- Mr. Galliano, whose return to fashion she helped orchestrate; Ms. Chapman, whom she featured in Vogue in 2018; and Demna of Balenciaga, whose mea culpa she published early last year -- this is more of a course correction after a reversion to mob mentality.
"To me the issue isn't only forgiveness, but also the severity with which we judge people in the first place," she wrote in an email. "I feel quite strongly that our culture has begun to move too quickly toward condemnation -- toward a feeling of certainty that particular offenses or mistakes are unforgivable. The truth is we rarely know the full story, and all of us are fallible."
Though Ms. Wintour acknowledged that there was behavior that was unforgivable, she declined to specify what might qualify as such, but presumably cases like those Ms. Scafidi cited, which involve a crime. Generally, she said, "we need to show more compassion, understanding and forgiveness, not less."
Can You Forgive but Not Forget?
The problem is, how does one measure repentance? No one can look into someone else's soul. Is it in money earmarked for the injured party in perpetuity? In the work itself? Public shaming requires public agreement as to what constitutes atonement and how that can or should be assessed, and that's a far harder subject to address. Easier, really, to shrug and move on.
"Speaking for myself, I have not forgiven Dolce & Gabbana," Ms. Karefa-Johnson said. She has refused to shoot that brand's clothing for the last five years, in part because she found the public apology unconvincing. "For me, there is a very clear route to redemption. It looks a lot like financial reparations"
The issue, Ms. Scafidi said, is this: "At the end of the day, consumers make fashion choices while looking in the mirror, not at the designer behind it. It can be hard to turn away from a flattering look to uphold an invisible principle." And where consumers and their wallets go, companies follow. To a certain extent, it has been ever thus.
"The ur-text for the public pardoning of a designer may be Chanel after World War II," Ms. Scafidi went on, referring to the continued global embrace of the brand as a paragon of chic despite Coco Chanel's role as a Nazi collaborator, now being told onscreen in the Apple TV+ fictionalized series "The New Look."
"With every biography or dramatization that reminds us of her Nazi associations," Ms. Scafidi said, "the price of the 2.55 bag seems to rise a bit higher." She wasn't talking about money.

Full text: At the 96th Academy Awards on Sunday, the red carpet showed not only its true color but also its reputation as a vehicle for elegant, over-the-top and even political fashion.
Though there were bright moments -- Cynthia Erivo's dress was a "Wicked" shade of green, Taylor Zakhar Perez wore powder blue Prada -- many of the gowns and tuxedos that graced the carpet were black. Some stars' ensembles harked back to attire they wore at prior Oscars ceremonies. Marlee Matlin said that her shimmering lilac Rodarte gown nodded to the dress she wore when she won the best actress award in 1987, and Lupita Nyong'o went with a pale bluish-silver Armani dress inspired by the color of the gown she wore when she won the best supporting actress award in 2014.
Sparkling brooches were among the most visible accessories on both men and women, as were tiny red pins calling for a cease-fire in Gaza. The Israel-Hamas war also influenced action off the carpet, with protests taking place as celebrities were arriving at the ceremony.
Of all the fashion on display at the Oscars, these 19 looks stood out as doing the most.
Billie Eilish: Most Young Old Hollywood!
The Gen Z singer, a songwriter for "Barbie," dialed up the glamour with flowing hair, a houndstooth Chanel bag and a tweed skirt suit with an Artists4Ceasefire pin on the jacket.
Lupita Nyong'o: Most Icy Cool!
The actress's feathered Armani gown, which nodded to the dress she wore when she won an Oscar for her performance in "12 Years a Slave," was not only nostalgic but also sustainable: It was made in 2020 and had yet to be worn.
Emma Stone: Most Palate Cleanser!
Amid all the dark outfits on the carpet, the "Poor Things" star's pale green peplum Louis Vuitton gown was a refreshing sight.
Dominic Sessa: Most Retro!
The actor evoked his 1970s-era wardrobe from "The Holdovers" in a dark velvety tuxedo with a peak-lapel jacket and a floppy bow tie. His loose curly hair and sideburns enhanced the look's vintage feel.
America Ferrera: Most Barbie!
Following in the sartorial footsteps of her "Barbie" co-stars, the actress wore a chain mail Atelier Versace dress in the film's signature pink color with a skirt that appeared to melt into the floor.
Colman Domingo: Most Razzle-Dazzle!
A sunburst brooch, glistening buttons and copious bracelets and rings added sparkle to the "Rustin" star's Louis Vuitton tuxedo, which he wore with "country-western boots," he told the E! host Laverne Cox.
Vanessa Hudgens: Most Dressing for Two!
The actress, a host of ABC's Oscars red carpet preshow, subtly announced that she was pregnant during that program with the help of a form-fitting Vera Wang gown.
Michelle Yeoh: Most Unapologetically Glamorous!
Together, the actress's iridescent, floor-sweeping, Balenciaga gown and bicep-skimming black gloves created the kind of confident look that said: I already have an Oscar.
Lily Gladstone: Most Night Sky!
Gucci collaborated with the Indigenous artist Joe Big Mountain to design the "Killers of the Flower Moon" actress's deep-blue gown, which featured quill work by the artist that looked a little like twinkling stars.
Ryan Gosling: Most Fun Socks!
Peeking out from beneath the pants of the actor's Gucci suit with shiny trim were pink socks, a less-than-subtle nod to his role as Ken in "Barbie."
Simu Liu: Most Black-Tie Pajamas!
The actor, who played one of the Kens in "Barbie," fastened the jacket of his asymmetrical Fendi tuxedo with a large brooch. "It is a fun situation and I like brooches," he told Ms. Cox of E! on the red carpet.
Emily Blunt: Most Futuristic!
Floating shoulder straps and a metallic sheen gave an out-of-this-world feel to the "Oppenheimer" actress's Schiaparelli couture gown.
Da'Vine Joy Randolph: Most Power Sleeves!
Pompom-like sleeves and a gauzy train added volume to the glittery, pale-blue Louis Vuitton gown chosen by the actress, a star of "The Holdovers."
Bradley Cooper: Most Relaxed!
In a double-breasted Louis Vuitton suit with no tie and with a sun-kissed glow, the "Maestro" star appeared very at ease on the carpet.
Sandra Hüller: Most Point Taken!
A pointy bust adorned with a jeweled keyhole was the focal point of the "Anatomy of a Fall" actress's Schiaparelli gown.
Anya Taylor Joy: Most Flower Power!
The mermaidesque skirt of the actress's silvery Dior gown looked as if it were constructed with glittering scales or flower petals.
Rita Moreno: Most Betty Boop!
The 92-year-old actress channeled the classic cartoon character in pixie-flapper hair, a ruffled dress, opera gloves and sparkly croissant-shaped Verdura earrings.
Andrea Riseborough: Most 'The Traitors'!
With its bold plaid pattern, the actress's Loewe dress would have fit right in with the reality show's Scottish-influenced wardrobe.
Eugene Lee Yang: Most Try Guy!
Mr. Yang, a voice actor in the animated feature "Nimona" and a member of the internet foursome turned threesome known as the Try Guys, certainly seemed to be angling for attention in his pompadour and scarlet tuxedo-style skirt suit by Walter Mendez.

A Longer Runway to See Ourselves On: [Style Desk]

Full text: More old(er) models walked on the runways this season, marking a step in the right direction for age representation.
There were many head-turning moments at the Balmain show at Paris Fashion Week, which was a love letter by the creative director Olivier Rousteing to his childhood home of Bordeaux. There were twisted gold snail shells hanging from ears and as belt buckles; there were metal handbags cast into clusters of grapes, which were later served up on rhinestone-encrusted minidresses and strapless peplum bustiers.
But the most striking aspect of the show was not the clothes on the runway but the age of many of the models wearing them. It was impossible to ignore that scores of them were ... well, older, and not just in terms of conventional fashion parlance (which historically would mean 25).
"I feel like we often celebrate one kind of beauty in fashion, which is youthful, and I'm worried about that approach," Mr. Rousteing said after his show, which included Axelle Doué, 70; Kristina de Coninck, 63; Estelle Levy, 51; and Marie Seguy, 47. In total, 20 out of 57 models were older than 35.
"We tend to forget that the future is also held within women that have had a life," he said. "For me, that's what I wanted to show: women that have lived and continue to live their lives, instead of just young girls that have their whole lives in front of them."
Mr. Rousteing was not the only designer to feel that way. Thanks to growing pressure on the industry to improve representation, women of and above middle age have become a more commonplace sight on the runway. This season, however, it was impossible to ignore their growing numbers. According to the fashion search engine Tagwalk, roughly three-quarters of the top 20 runway shows in both Paris and Milan featured at least one older model. At Vetements and Schiaparelli, the figure was closer to a fifth of all models cast. In New York last month, Batsheva cast only models over the age of 40.
Some of the older women on the runways were model legends, many of whom are now regular runway returnees. At Vetements, the actress Marcia Cross, 61, best known as Bree Van de Kamp in the Noughties television series "Desperate Housewives," closed the show before taking a bow with the supermodels Natalia Vodianova and Carmen Kass.
At Balmain, though, Mr. Rousteing said that given the ages of many of his clients, he wanted to recognize those who actually buy his clothes. Calvin Wilson, the casting director of Establishment Casting, which cast the show, said that their intent had been to include lesser known faces, many of them models who were also working in jobs outside the modeling industry.
"We created something more emotional by using more anonymous faces," Mr. Wilson said. "They offered blank spaces for the audience to ask questions about who these women were and how we see ourselves in them."
At Miu Miu, Miuccia Prada cast the actresses Kristin Scott Thomas, 63, and Ángela Molina, 68, but also Qin Huilan, 70, a Chinese doctor turned social media influencer from Shanghai. In her show notes, Mrs. Prada said that her collection was an exploration of clothes from children to adulthood and, in particular, notions of girlishness.
"It is a word that we can revalue, from a pejorative gendered noun, anchored to age, to a universal idiom expressive of a spirit of freedom and individuality and one attribute of a richer whole," she wrote.
It was a sentiment espoused by Ms. Huilan, a longtime Prada and Miu Miu client, who posted on Instagram about being approached by Miu Miu about modeling in the show through her direct messages. (They used Google Translate to overcome the language barrier.)
"I took action to prove that age is not a problem!" Ms. Huilan wrote.
"Who would have thought that at the age of 70, I would be standing here on the runway today? Come on! Look! This is Paris! Look! This is Miu Miu's runway!"

Easy-to-Make Bread, in Under Two Hours: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: This brown bread recipe, a staple of the Ballymaloe Cookery School in Cork, Ireland, is as satisfying and foolproof as they come.
The first time I had brown bread from Ballymaloe Cookery School in Cork, Ireland, was at a welcome lunch for students.
The menu was simple: Loaves of the bread accompanied poached Poole prawns from Ballycotton Bay, a 15-minute walk from the farm where the school sits. Darina Allen, the school's co-founder, buzzed around the room, encouraging us to spread thick slices of the bread with mayonnaise or butter, and pile on the tiny prawns. The quiet luxury of all of it was heady, but it was the plain brown loaf -- nutty, barely sweet and still warm -- that felt most special.
Recipe: Ballymaloe Brown Bread
"This recipe takes the time and mystery out of yeast breadmaking," Ms. Allen said. "It's a gift for life." She mixed yeast with warm water and some treacle syrup, let it foam, then stirred the mixture into whole-wheat flour, gave it a quick rise, and baked.
An adaptation of the Grant loaf, which Doris Grant, a nutritionist, created during World War II to make easy use of rations, the loaf was less fluffy than sandwich bread and less cakey than soda bread, with none of the chew of sourdough, and though it looked similar enough to Danish rugbrod, it was neither dense nor sour.
In time, Ms. Grant's recipe made its way to Ireland and into the hands of Myrtle Allen, Darina's mother-in-law and the chef of Ballymaloe House, an inn and restaurant. Myrtle Allen died in 2018, but the Ballymaloe kitchens continue to turn out 20 loaves of this bread each day, as it has for the past 40 years.
"Unlike an Irish soda bread, which is all about the handling, this one has no tricks or secrets," said JR Ryall, a pastry chef at Ballymaloe for two decades. "It's a simple process that makes something wonderful to eat."
Students at the cooking school and guests at Ballymaloe House have taken the recipe home and now bake it all over the world. Lily Starbuck, a former student, sells it at her cafe, the West End, on Fishers Island, N.Y. This summer, she plans to teach a cooking class with Ballymaloe brown bread as the first lesson: "I do not fear a drop in sales once people see how easy it can be," she said. "I instead see that as a victory in getting people back in the kitchen and nourishing themselves."
The version here makes a perfect loaf of bread in less than two hours. With its singularly low skill-to-outcome ratio, it has, for decades, broken through the baker-or-nonbaker divide.
Ballymaloe now makes this loaf with wheat grown on the farm, and Ms. Allen accompanies it with homemade butter and Camembert.
"I don't need a Prada handbag," she said. "For me, this is real luxury."

It Won't Carry Much, Not That Fans Mind: [Style Desk]

Full text: It's tiny. It's cheap. Trader Joe's stores can't seem to keep them on shelves.
Thaddeus Yan went to Trader Joe's more than a dozen times last week, but he wasn't there for groceries. Mr. Yan, a 23-year-old lifestyle content creator in Los Angeles, was searching for a tote bag.
Not just any tote bag, though. Trader Joe's new miniature tote bag, a version of its standard canvas bag that is just large enough to fit your lunch, a water bottle and a few sundries. The mini tote is sold in four colors -- blue, red, yellow and green -- and Mr. Yan was determined to own them all.
Priced at a modest $ 2.99, the limited-edition bag has become a hit on social media. Mr. Yan, a self-described Trader Joe's super fan, was one of many TikTok users to document their hunts for the item, which has become increasingly hard to find.
Mr. Yan first learned about the tote bags from the Instagram account @traderjoeslist, which is devoted to all things related to the store. (It is not run by Trader Joe's but by another fan of the company.)
"It's a cute little item. It's cheap. I feel like it's very fitting for my generation, which is Gen Z," Mr. Yan said. "I heard that they were extremely limited edition and this would be, like, a onetime drop."
He visited seven stores last week before finding one that had the bag. The first was the Trader Joe's location where he usually shops, where an employee told him the bag had already sold out and to check back later in the week. At another shop, he was told that people had begun lining up at 7:30 a.m., well before the store opened. He struck out there, too.
An employee at the eighth store he called told him it had a few bags left, but that they were flying off the shelves and he should hurry.
"There were so many people surrounding the display, and they were grabbing them so fast," Mr. Yan said of the scene when he arrived. "I took all the ones I could get." He bought four for himself and one for a friend.
According to some TikTok users, certain stores have placed a limit on the number of totes customers can purchase. Trader Joe's did not respond to requests for comment.
Erin Kurland, an employee at a Trader Joe's in Denver, said the tote bags had caused a "craze."
Ms. Kurland said that, while working a recent shift, a customer at her store purchased 10 bags. The customer was in Denver for a work trip and was worried the totes would sell out before being able to buy some at home.
"She made sure to go out of her way on a work conference to come get these totes," Ms. Kurland, 29, said.
While Ms. Kurland said her Trader Joe's location had otherwise been relatively calm, on TikTok some shoppers have posted videos of throngs of people emptying store displays.
Elinor Kim, 22, and her sister struck out at the first store they visited this week. When they arrived at a second, a line was already forming. Ms. Kim, a 22-year-old college student in Chino Hills, Calif., recorded the scene and posted the video on TikTok, calling the experience "scary." She also bought seven bags, some of which she gave to friends and family.
"I wasn't really sure what I was going to use it for, but I felt like with everyone grabbing, it made me want to get it, too," she said of the tote, which has already begun to appear on resale sites like eBay and Depop at a significant markup, with some priced as high as $ 20.
The tiny Trader Joe's bag is the latest in a series of totes that have had brushes with internet fame. In 2022, L.L. Bean's classic Boat and Tote bag got a modern upgrade when people began having the style monogrammed with ironic words and phrases. (Think "Prada" and "emotional baggage.") After the grocery-delivery company Fresh Direct stopped taking back its bags during the pandemic, some people started turning them into wearable works of art. And earlier this year, the lifestyle influencer Emily Mariko drew criticism after she began selling an extra-large tote for $ 120. (It sold out almost immediately.)
But not everyone has fallen for Trader Joe's latest riff on the classic canvas tote.
"Y'all are tweaking over a grocery bag," Olivia Akinfe, 22, said in a TikTok video.

Full text: Focused on recycled clothing, some brides are finding their wedding attire on vintage sites and at resale stores.
Last fall, Emmali Osterhoudt was at a Goodwill store in Birmingham, Ala., when she stumbled upon a Galia Lahav wedding gown. Though she was not yet engaged, Ms. Osterhoudt, 21, couldn't pass up the opportunity to purchase the find: The gown was priced at $ 25.
Her thrifting success went viral on TikTok, and brides chimed in with stories of how they thrifted their own wedding looks. Now set to wed her fiancé, Nicolas Gould, 23, who proposed in December, Ms. Osterhoudt, a nursing student, plans to wear the gown and thrift décor for her wedding.
Ms. Osterhoudt's shopping decisions reflect the growing movement toward circular fashion, the idea of recycling and reusing clothes. Thrifting is on track to become a $ 700 billion market by 2030, making it 23 percent of the fashion industry, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a British nonprofit organization that promotes a circular economy.
At Awoke Vintage in Brooklyn, N.Y., "We noticed an uptick about five years ago of people coming in and asking for wedding dresses, especially in the spring and summer," said Rachel Despeaux, an owner of the store. "People are more interested in having their big day be defined by wearing vintage," she said.
Awoke Vintage, which is known for its denim, typically skews toward casual clothing at its three stores in Brooklyn, but Ms. Despeaux says she now also stocks white and ivory dresses and suits to keep up with customer demand. She looks for '60s, '70s and '80s outfits, and keeps an eye out for bridesmaid and maid of honor dresses.
While white can be a tricky color for vintage -- it yellows over time -- Ms. Despeaux explained that the growing consumer interest in circular fashion has led her wholesalers, who specialize in vintage and thrift products sourced globally, to curate wedding collections for clients like her.
Also in Brooklyn, the Cha Cha Linda Vintage shop increasingly leans toward wedding looks, and the Los Angeles-based Happy Isles, which specializes in bridal wear, opened a salon last September in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood.
Katherine Geisel, 32, of Brooklyn, transitioned to a mostly vintage and secondhand wardrobe a few years ago, citing a pileup of fast fashion in her closet. "I hardly ever reached for pieces for more than one season," she said.
Ms. Geisel, a creative producer at the skin care company La Mer, says she regularly has "about 50 tabs open on my favorite vintage stores." She started sourcing pieces for her Sept. 23, 2023, wedding even before her engagement to Andrew Geisel, 31, a founder of the cafe group Citizens. She found items including a cream dress from the 1930s at Desert Vintage, in Manhattan, for her welcome party, and a sterling silver French comb from the late 1800s, purchased on 1stDibs, to wear for her ceremony. She bought a sequined gown with polka dots from Etéreo Vintage for dancing.
Prices can certainly be cheaper at thrift and vintage shops: Wedding dresses retail for $ 65 to $ 185 at Awoke Vintage, for instance, versus the average of $ 2,000 for new ones. But brides like Ms. Geisel said that the motivation was more about the hunt for an unique piece than about costs. She spent $ 4,000 on all her secondhand pieces.
Betsy Banchik, 37, an independent lawyer who splits her time between New York City and Charleston, S.C., counts a pair of Prada heels she purchased at Michael's, a consignment shop on Manhattan's Upper East Side, among her most prized accessories. "It surprised no one that I bought slightly used gowns," she said of her June 2022 wedding to Mitch Banchik, a 62-year-old restaurateur. "I love the thrill of unexpectedly finding an amazing item."
For her rehearsal dinner, Ms. Banchik wore a Sue Wong cocktail dress she bought on eBay, and for the ceremony, a Romona Keveza gown that was a showroom sample at Magnolia Bride, in Charleston, S.C.
Samantha Ruiz, 33, explained that thrifting helped her focus on her personal style, rather than follow trends. Ms. Ruiz, a bridal stylist from Santa Monica, Calif., typically spends her weekends at flea markets and estate sales, but she took a bigger leap for her wedding wardrobe. She traveled to Paris to visit thrift stores, finding pearl earrings for $ 5, a wedding dress for $ 70 and $ 5 cuff links for her fiancé, Daniel Williams, 36, who works in private equity. The two plan to marry in July in Puglia, Italy.
"With secondhand shopping, you're driven by what catches your eye and makes you happy to wear," Ms. Ruiz said. "A big part of the excitement to put on my wedding dress is showing off a really unique outfit I worked hard to put together."
And these outfits may have yet another life after the wedding. While most bridal gowns end up preserved in a box in storage, many thrifters view their wedding attire as a continuous piece in their closet.
Francesca Wallace, 29, the digital director of Vogue Australia, wore a secondhand Prada mini dress for her wedding reception in November 2022, which also included thrifted vases for the floral centerpieces and a wedding ring made from recycled gold. Her husband, Jordan McSwiney, wore a pocket square they found while thrifting in Tokyo.
"I felt wholly myself wearing the dress, and I loved that it wasn't something anyone had ever seen before," Ms. Wallace said of the secondhand Prada dress, for which she paid $ 460. "Since, I've worn it to cocktail events, and you'd never know it once doubled as a wedding dress!"

Nepo Babies Crowd the Runways: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The casting craze for celebrity kids hit the big time with the likes of Gigi Hadid and Kendall Jenner. In 2024, the trend is not slowing down.
At London Fashion Week, the honor of the final look at the Burberry show didn't go to a runway legend like Naomi Campbell, Agyness Deyn or Lily Donaldson, all of whom walked in the show. Instead, Maya Wigram, wearing a belted leather field jacket and billowing maxi-kilt, took the lap most models would kill for in her modeling debut.
Sorry. Maya who? Maya Wigram, the daughter of the much fetishized fashion designer Phoebe Philo, who recently started her own fashion label.
Fashion's fixation with celebrity scions is not new. Gigi and Bella Hadid, Kendall Jenner and Kaia Gerber -- many of the world's current batch of successful models were born to the rich and famous. (In the case of Ms. Gerber, whose mother is Cindy Crawford, it helps to have a bona fide supermodel to thank for her genes.)
Nepo babies can, in theory, go into any profession. The nepotism doesn't restrict them to the profession of their parents. It just means they had famous, successful family ties (or well-known last names) that helped them get ahead in their chosen field.
New York magazine may have declared 2022 as "the year of the nepo baby," but the trend of luxury brands hiring youngsters who are yet to achieve much professionally, but do happen to be sons and daughters of A-listers, is not abating. If anything, it has been gaining momentum.
Scarlet Stallone, a daughter of Sylvester Stallone, walked her first runway for Tommy Hilfiger during New York Fashion Week. Deva Cassel, a daughter of Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel, modeled for Alberta Ferretti in Milan. Iris Law, whose parents are Jude Law and Sadie Frost, is the current face of Burberry. She is also a new Victoria's Secret recruit alongside Lila Moss, daughter of Kate.
Lennon Gallagher, whose dad is the Oasis rocker Liam Gallagher, and Romeo Beckham, a son of David and Victoria Beckham, have recently scored high-profile modeling gigs. Eve Jobs, daughter of Steve, walked for Louis Vuitton last season and Michael Kors this season.
And one of the most booked models of the moment is Amelia Gray Hamlin, a daughter of Lisa Rinna of "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills." She has been pounding the runways of Paris after being hired last year by the likes of Miu Miu, Balenciaga and Versace.
The appeal for brands seems clear. "Clicks are the new advertising," said the former casting director James Scully. "Nepo babies direct huge amounts of online traffic and engagement regardless of how tall they are or how well they can walk."
He noted that many such models have large social media followings and bring millions of new eyeballs to a brand, thanks to the fan bases established around their family's footholds in reality television, music or entertainment. Often, conventional industry thresholds are lowered to accommodate them.
"Kaia Gerber and Gigi Hadid would have walked into agencies and been signed, whoever their parents were," Mr. Scully continued. "That said, the net is cast very wide now, and almost anyone will do. If you're the average-looking daughter of a celebrity these days, then frankly you are as likely to be cast in a Prada show as if you are an actual model."
According to Lucie Greene, a trend forecaster for Light Years, much of our gawking is driven by a primal impulse to search nepo baby faces for recognizable genetic similarities and contrasts with their famous parents, and to praise or shame them accordingly. There's also a sense of being in the know, she said. Perhaps you knew the lineage of Ms. Wigram before anyone else.
Then, too, at a time when beautiful young models are 10 a penny (and often not especially scintillating in interviews), a carefully curated tidbit or beauty tip gleaned from someone raised inside an A-lister household generates far more headlines than those with a conventional background.
"There's a race on now to secure the latest progeny to come of age, and a sense of cachet for the brand that gets to book the latest nepo on the block as a model or friend of the house," Ms. Greene said.
Then there is the allure for the offspring themselves, fetishized and fawned over in a world where being a model -- and having the ability and influence to sell a product because of the way you look -- appears to be the ultimate form of public validation. Twenty years ago, nepo babies like Stella Tennant who were trying to model would often distance themselves from their family name so they would not be accused of nepotism. In 2024, most actively court that attention, knowing the power it brings.
"Generation Z kids with inherited fame were brought up in this mess," Mr. Scully said. "Their standards of beauty and taste and accomplishment are different because they live in the age of influencers, so this is all they know. Digital personas are as important to them as their real ones, whoever your mom or dad is."
Many children eventually use the profile boost from their modeling as a steppingstone to something else -- often acting -- as seen in the leaps from the runway to Hollywood by Lily-Rose Depp, Rafferty Law and Dree Hemingway. Many grouch that the outrage and opprobrium they attract is unfair. Almost all of them say that they may get a foot in the door, only to have to work twice as hard and be twice as good to prove themselves equal to the task, which inevitably prompts backlash from fellow models with less starry origin stories.
After Ms. Depp complained about the resentment during an interview in 2022, the model Vittoria Ceretti wrote on Instagram: "I know it's not your fault, but please, appreciate and know the place you came from. You can tell me your sad little story about it (even at the end of the day you can still always cry on your dad's couch in your villa in Malibu), but how about not being able to pay for your flight back home to your family?"
Anok Yai also posted her thoughts about nepo-baby models on the social media platform. "Seeing people benefit from nepotism doesn't bother me at all -- I know my talent and work ethic will get me into any room I want," she wrote. "But goddamn if only you knew the hell we go through just to be able to stand in the same room you were born in."

She's Subtly Dressing Hollywood's Cool Girls: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Danielle Goldberg was sitting at a table with her eyes glued to a laptop screen. On it was the actress Greta Lee, who was trying on a satin gown the same color as the flesh of a banana.
"This dress cannot puddle," Mrs. Goldberg, 40, said, squinting her eyes as she focused on a slight break at the bottom of the custom Loewe piece. (Ms. Lee is an ambassador for the brand.) It was just past 9 on a Saturday evening in January, the night before the Golden Globe Awards, and Mrs. Goldberg, a stylist, was conducting a video fitting from her studio in New York with Ms. Lee, who was beaming in from her home in Los Angeles.
"What it's doing right now," Mrs. Goldberg said of the dress onscreen, "it can't do that. It has to be perfect." Nanaz Hatami, a tailor Mrs. Goldberg has worked with for five years, who was with Ms. Lee, sprang into action.
Video fittings have been a solution for the stylist as she has juggled the demands of her job, which lately has included dressing Ms. Lee along with the actress Ayo Edebiri and the singer-songwriter Olivia Rodrigo for awards season appearances.
Mrs. Goldberg, who lives in downtown Manhattan with her husband, Michael Goldberg, a creative director, and their young son, doesn't like to spend too much time away from home if she can help it. Especially now that she is pregnant with her second child.
Halfway through the fitting with Ms. Lee, flashes of red began appearing at the bottom corner of Mrs. Goldberg's laptop. They were photos from the stylist's assistant in Los Angeles showing Ms. Edebiri in her own custom dress, made of scarlet satin by Prada. The following night, millions of viewers watched as Ms. Edebiri clutched the gown's train while accepting the Golden Globe for best actress in a TV musical or comedy.
The next Sunday, Mrs. Goldberg was contemplating another outfit with Ms. Edebiri, this time in person at a Los Angeles hotel where the two were meeting ahead of the Critics Choice Awards. In a video call from the hotel room, Mrs. Goldberg explained that the actress's look -- a roomy white suit by the Row and wire-rimmed Oliver Peoples sunglasses -- was inspired by outfits worn by Whoopi Goldberg in the '90s.
Mrs. Goldberg has been working with Ms. Edebiri for just a few months: The actress's team approached the stylist after noticing her work with Ms. Lee and Kaia Gerber, a model and an actress. (Mrs. Goldberg's celebrity styling fees are typically paid by studios and brands working with her clients.) Ms. Edebiri, 28, said Mrs. Goldberg had played a crucial role as her profile rose after she received a spate of accolades for her work in "The Bear."
She choked back tears as she described how Mrs. Goldberg's approach to styling had made her feel comfortable and, in turn, confident. "We have these conversations," Ms. Edebiri said. "Sometimes it will be, like, an ode to Whoopi. Then I can have that in my mind when I'm out there taking pictures, which is fun. It's like an actor telling a story."
"I get to be myself," she said, "but also have this armor of the clothes."
Chioma Nnadi, the head of editorial content at British Vogue, said Ms. Edebiri had made "strong fashion choices" that still reflected her "sense of humor and youthful energy" -- a balance, Ms. Nnadi added, that can be hard to strike. Mrs. Goldberg's ability to shape a rising star's look, she said, "is so powerful."
Recent looks Mrs. Goldberg has styled -- including a feathered-and-opera-gloved ensemble by Bottega Veneta that Ms. Edebiri wore to the British Academy Film Awards on Sunday, and Ms. Rodrigo's vintage white Versace gown at the Grammys -- reflect her aim to have "this moment that feels like a quiet statement," as she put it.
Zanna Roberts Rassi, a fashion correspondent for "E! Live from the Red Carpet," described Mrs. Goldberg's aesthetic as an antidote to the flamboyant attire that has lately been embraced as formal wear. "You know when you are in a meeting and there is a person who speaks quietly and you really listen to them?" Ms. Rassi said. "She is the equivalent of that."
Ms. Lee, 40, compared her relationship with Mrs. Goldberg to "the dreamiest collaboration" between an actor and a director. The "Past Lives" actress said the outfits they have chosen -- like a meme-inspiring, blood-orange Bottega Veneta dress she wore to the Governors Awards last month in Los Angeles -- are not for attention, but "for no one other than us."
They met in 2013 when Mrs. Goldberg had a gig in the wardrobe department of a TV show on which Ms. Lee was a guest star. Later that decade, Ms. Lee approached Mrs. Goldberg about dressing her while preparing to promote another show.
The stylist put the actress, who was pregnant at the time, in an archival floral-print dress from a Balenciaga collection by Nicolas Ghesquière. "I knew that I wanted to do something mini, even though she was pregnant," Mrs. Goldberg said. "Greta can carry fashion that isn't easy and make it look effortless."
Ms. Lee said their red-carpet moments could not have been achieved without the stylist's exhaustive researching of references and encyclopedic memory of runway shows. Mrs. Goldberg started learning about the industry sooner than others: Her father, Oded Nachmani, founded a contemporary sportswear line called Coolwear not long after she was born. (Her mother, Carrie Nachmani, came up with the name for the brand, now defunct.)
She was raised in Old Westbury, N.Y., and has two younger sisters, Michaela Podolsky and Arielle Charnas, both of whom are influencers. Ms. Charnas may be better known to some as Something Navy, the name she used to develop an audience online and then later to start a clothing brand of her own, which has drawn criticism for the quality of its products and has reportedly accrued millions in debt.
"To see her build her own business and see it fail publicly," Mrs. Goldberg said, before collecting herself. "My sister has incredibly thick skin," she said of Ms. Charnas. "She needs to figure out what her next step is, and she is. The noise doesn't help."
Mrs. Goldberg said she is far less comfortable with sharing her personal life on social media than her sisters are. Ms. Lee said: "In her dreams she would be invisible."
While studying at Syracuse University, Mrs. Goldberg had internships at Vogue and with the stylist Andrea Lieberman. Her first job out of college was a front-desk position at Pier 59 Studios in Manhattan. It afforded her face time with editors and stylists she aspired to work with. "That was my savviest moment to date," she said.
She was later hired as a fashion assistant at T: The New York Times Style Magazine but was fired after six months because jewelry was misplaced. "It was a crucial lesson," she said.
Two other magazine jobs followed before Mrs. Goldberg started working as an assistant to Annabel Tollman, a celebrity and editorial stylist. While she was working for Ms. Tollman, who died in 2013, her boss started styling Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen for a tour promoting their 2008 book, "Influence." Mrs. Goldberg got to know the sisters and, in 2009, she was approached about dressing them for the Met Gala.
"I was in a Patagonia store when I got the call," she said. "My head nearly exploded." She dressed Mary-Kate in vintage Christian Lacroix. Ashley wore a white gown by the Row.
She continued to dress the Olsens for events and appearances in the months that followed before moving on to jobs styling runway shows for New York designers like Timo Weiland and Tanya Taylor. She styled Ethan Hawke for a period after meeting the actor at a photo shoot.
In 2017, she dressed Kendall Jenner for a Pepsi commercial that the brand quickly pulled after criticism that it trivialized Black Lives Matter protests. "It was insane to me how it all turned out," Mrs. Goldberg said, adding that she had no knowledge of what the final ad would be.
That same year Laura Harrier hired Mrs. Goldberg while that actress was promoting the film "Spider-Man: Homecoming." "Laura hiring me changed everything," Mrs. Goldberg said, because she was hungry for clients who "really loved fashion."
On a Wednesday in late January, Mrs. Goldberg was at her studio organizing both Ms. Rodrigo's wardrobe for the Grammys and Ms. Edebiri's for a "Saturday Night Live" hosting gig (a Thom Browne corset and pants). "If I wasn't this pregnant, I would be getting on the first flight to L.A. after 'S.N.L.' for the Grammys," she said.
Her second child, a girl, is due in May -- the same week as the Met Gala. Maternity leave doesn't exist in her chosen profession, Mrs. Goldberg joked.
But time off, according to Ms. Lee, is not something the stylist often seeks out. "Danielle is so satiated by the work," she said. "She is relentless."

Envisioning a Market That's Out of This World: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Much of the American space program is run out of nondescript offices in the Washington, D.C., suburbs. That's where Kam Ghaffarian, the billionaire space entrepreneur, could be found on an auspicious day. Exactly 47 years before, he had immigrated to the United States from Iran. Mr. Ghaffarian, 66, sat at a table made of gently glowing white onyx, also from Iran.
Mr. Ghaffarian said he imported the stone because of its unique translucence when lit and because of the energy (spiritual, not physical) that the billion-year-old mineral emits. He is a big believer in the importance of meditating to connect with the energy in the universe, which he has done on a daily basis for decades.
"When you touch it, you feel the energy of the stone," he said. "How many years? Go ahead, touch it."
He was in the market for good energy. Just a few weeks later, Mr. Ghaffarian's company tried to do something no private organization has ever done: Touch down softly on the surface of the moon.
Mr. Ghaffarian specializes in moonshots. His array of companies includes not just the one sending a lander to the moon, but also one building a space station to put in orbit around the Earth, another designing advanced nuclear reactors, a venture fund and a nonprofit studying faster-than-light travel technology. His projects are the kind that Silicon Valley frets about having given up on. They are bets on tangible technology, not software, where metrics like hits and clicks are replaced with the hard questions of physics.
And while bombastic billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have captured attention for their efforts to launch futuristic reusable rockets, the lower-profile Mr. Ghaffarian's companies have helped answer the question of what to do with them, becoming crucial in the increasingly close partnership between NASA and private industry. SpaceX's key innovation has been building rockets that have brought down the cost of going to space. Mr. Ghaffarian's firms are using those cheap rockets to commercialize space activity in ways that Mr. Musk's SpaceX hasn't pursued, while Mr. Bezos' Blue Origin has yet to reach orbit.
Mr. Ghaffarian is a believer in that public-private model. "If you look at cars or planes and all of that, there were entrepreneurs who created that and changed the game, right?" he said. "What comes to mind is Henry Ford or Howard Hughes."
Going Private
Intuitive Machines, co-founded by Mr. Ghaffarian in 2013, is the only publicly traded American company focused on lunar exploration. The goal is to eventually build power stations, satellite networks and other infrastructure for the kind of sci-fi moon base that space dorks have lusted after for years.
On Thursday, Intuitive Machines launched a moon lander named Odysseus onboard a SpaceX rocket, the first of two it intends to dispatch to the nearby satellite this year on NASA's behalf. When the lander reported a successful separation to its flight controllers, Mr. Ghaffarian received a text message from Intuitive's mission director: "Congratulations Kam, you've got a new boy, his name is Ody, and he's already talking."
If all goes well, Odysseus will land on the moon on Feb. 22. The hexagonal lander is studded with the space agency's cameras, lidar, a laser reflector and a sensor to measure the moon's plasma environment.
But unlike the typical NASA mission, this one carries cargo paid for by private organizations. Odysseus has insulation designed by Columbia Sportswear, a stunt based on the company's insulated jackets. It carries the first data center from a company, Lonestar Data Holdings, that wants to store information on the moon. And it contains art: 125 miniature moons created by Jeff Koons and sealed in a six-inch plastic cube, paid for by an NFT company and intended to be left on the lunar surface.
"Even five years ago, I wouldn't talk about lunar activity," said Chris Quilty, a space industry analyst who credits Intuitive Machines with normalizing the idea of a moon business. "People would look at me kind of funny."
Becoming the first private company to safely reach the moon (or any other astronomical object, for that matter) would be no small feat. The lunar surface is dotted with recent failed attempts. Astrobotic, the first American company to launch, suffered a fatal propellant leak before it made it into lunar orbit; another rival went out of business before even getting off the ground.
As for the national programs, their record isn't much better in recent years. A Russian touchdown went awry, and India failed in its first attempt in 2019 before succeeding last year. Japan's space agency put a lander on the moon in January, just to see it tip over. Only China's National Space Administration has touched down cleanly on the moon multiple times in the 21st century.
American space believers, and hawkish members of Congress, feel pressure to catch up. NASA's decision to hire Intuitive Machines and others to send robots to the moon is intended to accelerate the nation's lunar return. Intuitive Machines is one of more than a dozen firms NASA tapped to bid on lunar landing missions. This current mission is, essentially, the first wave of the Artemis program, begun by the Trump administration in 2017, which aims to have American astronauts touch down again on the moon as soon as 2026.
When the Apollo program sent astronauts on brief missions to the moon between 1969 and 1972, those voyages of discovery were intended to demonstrate U.S. technological superiority.
The goal of this generation's moon campaign is slightly different. As the NASA administrator Bill Nelson likes to say, this time, we're going to stay.
Artemis, if NASA gets its way, will have humans making repeated, long-term visits to Earth's nearest astronomical neighbor, for scientific research and to enable exploration deeper into space. There's another new goal: The agency also wants to create the conditions for an off-world economy -- eventually building up infrastructure, transportation, payment systems and more. (All of that would, yes, demonstrate America's innovative might to global rivals and friends alike.)
NASA has always needed private companies to build its vehicles and staff its facilities. (Mr. Ghaffarian even worked for Ford's no-longer-extant space division at the beginning of his career.) But traditionally, the agency reserved control of design decisions for its elite engineers.
In the years after the loss of the space shuttle Columbia and the seven astronauts on board in 2003, NASA decided to focus its limited budget on science and deep space exploration, and to outsource the design and fabrication of vehicles to reach the space station to private companies like SpaceX. Notably, the companies would own the IP and the vehicles after the fact, and they could sell their services to private customers.
"Sometimes our ambitions extend beyond what resources are provided through the usual channels," Alexander MacDonald, NASA's chief economist, said of the agency's public-private partnerships. "We can't do everything we want by ourselves."
The success of this model changed the business of space. NASA saved billions of dollars, while SpaceX has come to dominate the rocket industry. This seeded a new generation of space companies eager to take advantage of the falling cost of access to space--and to pitch NASA on similar team-ups, which allowed the agency to stretch its limited budget further. Venture capitalists and Wall Street investors were thrilled at forecasts of a "trillion-dollar space economy" from the likes of Morgan Stanley, and threw billions of dollars at firms that wanted to do business in orbit. Mr. Ghaffarian saw an opportunity to make up for lost time.
A Cog in the Space Program
If you talk about space with anyone of a certain age, the moon landing inevitably comes up. Mr. Ghaffarian saw one small step for man as an 11-year-old in his hometown, Isfahan, watching on his neighbor's TV. He slept outside with his brothers on hot summer nights, mesmerized by the stars. He knew the road there went through the United States. At 18, in 1977, he abandoned a scholarship at Iran's well-regarded Shiraz University, and caught a direct flight from Tehran to New York City with $ 2,000 borrowed from an uncle.
In the United States, he studied computer science. After graduating, he got a job working on mainframes at Georgetown University Hospital, in the basement next to the morgue. He became an ardent American citizen. Soon, he joined Lockheed Martin, working as a contractor to build the computer systems that pull down scientific data collected by astronauts: He was a cog in the space program.
One day, in 1994, he took out a $ 250,000 mortgage on his house; called a former boss, Harold Stinger; and convinced him they should start their own firm offering engineering expertise to NASA on a contractual basis. Over the next two decades, the minority-owned small business grew to become one of the space agency's top contractors.
His firm had won a dream role in a program under the George W. Bush administration to return to the moon, but as NASA's budget forecasts became bloated and the 2008 financial crisis shook the economy, the Obama administration canceled the program in 2010. "I hated the decision," Mr. Ghaffarian said. "We have wasted so much money on the programs within NASA that we started that we didn't complete."
In 2007, he accompanied his business partner Mr. Stinger on a philanthropic trip to Kinshasa, Uganda. There, Mr. Ghaffarian had a bit of a midlife crisis. His "transformation moment" came as they visited a school they sponsored, which wasn't connected to the electrical grid.
Mr. Ghaffarian says he realized that "if you don't have power, you don't have clean water, you don't have education, you can't really get out of poverty, and then I'm also looking at climate change." Now financially independent from the business he'd started with Mr. Stinger, he decided to found a string of companies tackling challenging problems, starting with X-Energy in 2009, dedicated to building nuclear reactors, and soon followed by businesses in orbit and beyond.
Mr. Ghaffarian is a collector of people. He spots his targets at the awkward meetings when a losing NASA contractor hands over the keys to the winner, or at a poker game he hosted for space insiders. He stays in touch, and one day, he convinces them to take a job -- or start a company.
Steve Altemus got collected when he was the top engineer at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. After 24 years at the space agency, Mr. Altemus wanted to do something different.
In 2013 he co-founded Intuitive Machines with Mr. Ghaffarian. The idea was to apply NASA know-how to solve problems in other industries -- medical devices, advanced energy production -- but a sustainable business plan was slow to emerge. Then, in 2018, under NASA's new model, the agency issued a call for the private sector to carry scientific sensors to places like the craters of the lunar South Pole, where orbiting spacecraft have detected evidence of water ice.
It was a risk to pour millions into a business that did not exist beyond a gleam in NASA's eye, but Mr. Ghaffarian, Mr. Altemus and Tim Crain, Intuitive Machines' chief technology officer and another former NASA engineer, felt the pull of the moon. After the Obama-era program cancellations, "for years I couldn't look at the moon without getting a queasy feeling in the pit of my stomach," Mr. Crain wrote in an email. "I wanted to be sure that we were really going to give the effort the energy it deserved."
In the next five years, the team designed, tested and built its moon lander; won a series of NASA contracts; and went public in 2023, raising tens of millions of dollars in capital and making Mr. Ghaffarian, on paper at least, a billionaire.
The World's Space Airline
Mr. Ghaffarian's other big bet on the new space economy, Axiom Space, co-founded in 2016 with Michael Suffredini, the longtime manager of the International Space Station, could be called the world's first spaceline. It trains and flies passengers on SpaceX rockets to the International Space Station for stays of about a week, in preparation for building its own space station. Axiom faces competition from other would-be space station companies, including Mr. Bezos' Blue Origin. And it's grabbed headlines for a partnership with Prada to design lunar spacesuits for NASA.
When the space agency announced in 2019 that it would charge about $ 3.5 million per passenger for visits to the International Space Station, some fretted about the inequality of allowing the wealthy to visit a government lab in space. The full cost of a trip also includes a rocket ticket thought to cost $ 60 million or more.
But Axiom's subsequent business has turned out differently: It has taken on the role of flying astronauts from friendly foreign nations seeking more experience in orbit.
In January, Axiom flew the first Turkish astronaut, Alper Gezeravci, as part of an international mission that included Swedish and Italian astronauts; it is planning an all-British mission next year. Last year, it flew a crew that included two Saudis, one of whom was the country's first female astronaut.
"The ability of the U.S. private sector to expand such opportunities is, in my view, very complementary to U.S. diplomatic interests," Scott Pace, the director of George Washington University's Space Policy Institute, wrote in an email. "Flying foreign astronauts on commercial missions is just a new facet of U.S. leadership in space." The coalition of countries that operate the International Space Station expect to retire it before the end of the decade. But NASA and the rest of the world will still want outposts in orbit close to our planet. True to its new partnership approach, the agency has asked private companies to develop their own stations. Axiom has set out to do that, and won the right to attach its own module to the International Space Station in 2026.
There is a risk that these big swings have come too soon: SpaceX was able to sell its rockets to many customers seeking access to space, but the commercial market for visits to space stations or the moon is far less proven. It may not be as robust as hoped, or robust enough to support multiple companies.
True believers in the space economy, though, envision moving from a world of government space exploration toward a future where activity in space is much like activity on Earth -- a mélange of people, companies and countries with divergent aims. Before the Odysseus launch, Mr. Ghaffarian spoke to the assembled crowd of his colleagues, NASA civil servants, SpaceX employees and investors, taking them on an imaginary journey decades into the future.
"We might have hourly visits to the space station or Space City, daily trips to the moon, and weekly trips to Mars, and maybe interstellar travel," he told them.
"I just believe that the ultimate destiny for humanity is to go to stars," he said.

Full text: From a reimagined centuries-old palazzo to a private apartment with a rooftop terrace, five new places to stay that offer a fresh vision of the city.
While Rome's charms may be, as they say, eternal, it's never been a city particularly prized for its hotels. Until recently, upmarket lodging in the Italian capital usually meant an ostentatiously decorated pile meant to evoke the city's 16th- and 17th-century palazzi, stuffed with gilded furniture and vague nostalgia. Over the past year or so, an entirely new breed of luxury hotel has emerged, one that pays tribute to the modernist architects who remade much of Rome in the Rationalist style in the early-to-mid-20th century. The Bulgari hotel, for example, opened last summer in a hulking 1930s government building designed by the prominent Trieste-born architect Vittorio Ballio Morpurgo. And the Edition hotel moved into a bank partly attributed to Marcello Piacentini, the architect responsible for the EUR district, the neighborhood of massive edifices constructed under Mussolini. Other notable new offerings take their style cues from 21st-century Scandinavia, deftly blending northern design aesthetics with Italian Renaissance art and Roman artifacts. Here, a closer look at five new accommodations that break with tradition.
Six Senses Rome
The first city hotel from a company better known for its beach resort and spas, Six Senses Rome opened last spring in a historic palazzo on Piazza San Marcello, a short walk from the Pantheon. The Spanish architect Patricia Urquiola oversaw the design, keeping the graceful lines of the original structure while transforming it into a light-drenched contemporary retreat. She housed the reception and lobby bar in a glass-topped atrium, filling the space with giant potted plants. In one section of the lobby, glass flooring reveals a glimpse of an ancient subterranean baptismal pool that belongs to the neighboring church. For the 96 guest rooms, Urquiola finished the walls with cocciopesto plaster, a type of lime wash made with crushed bricks, a construction material as old as the city itself, while the furnishings, in muted pastels and rounded shapes, are unmistakably modern. Then there's the spa, in many ways the centerpiece of the hotel. Awash in travertine marble, it includes five treatment rooms, a yoga studio, a series of indoor plunge pools, a hammam and a space dedicated to biohacking treatments, like pulsed electromagnetic field therapy and LED light masks, for when all the age-old wellness remedies don't quite cut it. Rooms from about $ 1,200 a night.
Palazzo Ripetta
In the 1960s, Luigi Moretti, the Roman architect who designed the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C., remade Palazzo Ripetta, a 17th-century Catholic school for poor and orphaned girls, into a residence and hotel. Ownership has remained in the same family since then, but the 78-room property underwent a top-to-bottom renovation in 2022. A highlight of the newest iteration is the San Baylon restaurant, which reinterprets traditional Italian recipes. Here, for example, the classic vitello tonnato is served as a block of marbled veal resting on a dollop of foamy tuna sauce. The guest rooms too offer a sly twist on old conventions. The rooms -- by Fausta Gaetani, the designer behind Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano -- are all slightly different in style but follow a similar theme: pale walls with classic molding, brightly patterned upholstery, abstract art and a rainbow of Murano glass lighting fixtures. Rooms from about $ 600 a night.
Bulgari Hotel Roma
As of last June, the former headquarters of the Italian social security agency is now home to the newest Bulgari Hotel, an offshoot of the luxury jewelry brand. The Milanese architects Antonio Citterio and Patricia Viel retained many of the decorative features found in Morpurgo's original building, including mosaics depicting Roman myths splashed several stories high across the facade. The décor for the 110 guest rooms leans into the company's heritage, adopting jewel tones like peridot green and topaz yellow for its color scheme and reproducing some of the historic house's most prized settings in mosaic form above the marble bathtubs, a nod to Morpurgo's imagery on the building's exterior. As for dining venues, guests have several to choose from, including a restaurant and chocolate shop by three-Michelin-star chef Niko Romito and, in warmer months, a rooftop bar that peers onto the brick mausoleum of the Roman emperor Augustus, located just across the road. Rooms from about $ 1,750 a night.
The Rome Edition
Set back from a quiet residential street just behind the fashionable thoroughfare Via Veneto, a tranquil garden stuffed with shady green foliage buffers the new 93-room Rome Edition from the city at large, making the entrance beneath the cavernous lobby's 20-foot-high ceilings feel all the more dramatic. Inside, the most inviting spaces are decidedly intimate. There's the 14-seat Jade Bar in the lobby, furnished with velvet sofas and swathed in emerald-color stone. And nearby, concealed behind an unmarked door, is the speakeasy-style Punch Room, with a fireplace carved from Rosso Levanto marble. Guest rooms follow a neutral palette, with walnut wood boiserie and parquet floors, white Carrara marble in the bathrooms and layers of cream-colored textiles that beautifully capture the morning sunlight. Rooms from about $ 1,750 a night.
Palazzo delle Pietre
When Patrizia Albano, a lawyer, and her husband, Carlo Mazzi, the former president of Prada, first conceived of Palazzo delle Pietre, an eight-room hotel just off Piazza Navona, they imagined it as an extension of their own home. The sheets are Rivolta Carmignani and the tableware is from Richard Ginori, just like theirs, while fragments of millenniums-old sculptures and carved Corinthian columns from their private collection are placed almost haphazardly throughout the property. The hotel has been around since 2019, but last summer, it opened an extension called the Appartamenti La Corte, two smartly decorated flats -- one with two bedrooms, the other three -- located on the upper floors of a neighboring building. Both are furnished with full kitchens, Italian-made furniture and a handful of the owners' architectural artifacts. The larger of the two apartments, measuring nearly 1,300 square feet, also offers a rooftop terrace and private sauna. Rooms from about $ 650 a night; two-night minimum required.

In the Art World, She's a Living and Breathing Fake: [Review]

Full text: Camila Mendes plays a broke assistant posing as an art world bigwig in this slyly charming romantic comedy.
Good artists copy; great artists steal. I coined that -- OK, Picasso supposedly did. But the maxim may as well be stamped across the forehead of Ana Santos (Camila Mendes), a broke, harried auction house assistant who, after scoring a major work trip to London, falls into posing as an art world V.I.P.
In "Upgraded," a sly charmer on Amazon Prime Video, not only is Ana dealt the lucky break to London, but she also obtains a flight upgrade to first class, where her seat happens to be next to Will (Archie Renaux), the unassuming heir to a fine art fortune. Mistaking her for an art scene notable, the British flirt welcomes Ana into the fold, setting in motion an impostor comedy stacked with ritzy outings, make-out montages and close calls with Ana's persnickety boss (Marisa Tomei).
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Directed by Carlson Young, "Upgraded" also takes a page from the Picasso handbook, borrowing liberally from "The Devil Wears Prada" and other stories of industrious underlings faking it to make it. Indeed, one senses that Mendes, a chic and effortless leading lady, would have made for a much more palatable Emily in Paris.
The movie is unevenly directed, and some scenes struggle to clear even the low bar set by more polished streaming originals. But Young succeeds nonetheless in channeling the freshman thrill of plunging into an alluring adult milieu. Its class-conscious foundations ensure that "Upgraded" never veers into lifestyle porn, but many of its fairy-tale pleasures hinge on vicarious consumption -- much like the art world.
Upgraded
Rated R for language in its blue period. Running time: 1 hour 44 minutes. Watch on Prime Video.

Full text: The brand hosted a celebrity-fueled bash for its U.S. foray into high-end jewelry.
On Wednesday night, a throng of actors, cycling through a swirl of events -- awards season, New York Fashion Week and the Super Bowl -- assembled in Midtown Manhattan, wearing Chanel, dressed by Chanel and for Chanel.
Over cocktails, guests mingled for the opening of the brand's first U.S. watch and fine jewelry flagship boutique on Fifth Avenue near 57th Street, designed by the architect Peter Marino with elements from Coco Chanel's apartment in Paris.
America Ferrera greeted Natasha Lyonne. Kerry Washington chatted with Elizabeth Olsen. Katie Holmes posed for photos with Michelle Williams. Zazie Beetz convened with Rachel Brosnahan. Dianna Agron lingered. And nearby, Carey Mulligan and Jerrod Carmichael talked.
The new flagship store for fine jewelry and watches comes as New York's retail space prices have kept rising over the past year. The move seemingly positions Chanel in a sector of the fashion industry that other brands, like Prada and LVMH, are also embracing.
The location on Fifth Avenue -- sandwiched among Cartier, Tiffany & Company, Bulgari and Harry Winston -- was a yearslong waiting game, according to Frédéric Grangié, the president of Chanel's watches and fine jewelry.
"It's a big step for the house," Mr. Grangié said.
Steps away from the boutique, around 200 guests, including Lori Harvey, Francesca Scorsese and the actor Molly Gordon, shuffled into a dimly lit event space for dinner. In contrast to the store's well-lit sparkle, the multilevel venue was enveloped in darkness that mimicked the shuttered Abercrombie & Fitch that was once there.
People reflected on their favorite everyday accessories, like Ms. Lyonne's grandmother's gold chain. "I never saw her as a Tony Montana type. She was just a little Hungarian lady in a Pucci dress," she said.
The actor Taylour Paige, who loves her tennis bracelet and engagement ring, said that you can never have too many rings.
"If anyone says you're wearing too many rings, cut them out of your life," she said.
For the actors Tommy Dorfman and Amandla Stenberg, watches, which were family heirlooms passed down from generations, elicit a sense of nostalgia and sentimentality in an era of smart devices.
White roses lined long tables where influential guests like Lauren Santo Domingo, the artistic director of Tiffany's homewares; Larry Gagosian, the gallery magnate; and Sean MacPherson, the hotelier, enjoyed oysters, caviar-topped potatoes, lobster or wagyu, and a two-tiered assorted dessert tower. After one course, guests were offered vodka shots.
Seth Meyers, the late-night host, did rounds greeting Ms. Ferrera and Ms. Olsen at one table, Ms. Beetz in another section with Ms. Holmes, and then later settling at his table with Ms. Washington and Ms. Williams.
When it grew late, the crowd was invited to the basement for a surprise performance, and the singer Gracie Abrams took the stage to a backdrop lit like a starry sky.

A Colossus (or, at Least, a Good Copy) Towers Again Over Rome: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: A 1:1 facsimile of the statue of Constantine shows how modern technology can help recreate the past, and offers new ideas for scholarship.
It may not be authentic, exactly, or very old at all.
But the colossal statue of a fourth-century emperor, Constantine the Great, is a newly erected monument to Rome if nothing else: a homage to the ancient city's grandeur, and of its endless capacity to remake itself.
In this case, the remaking was literal.
Towering over visitors, the 43-foot seated statue was painstakingly reconstructed by a Madrid-based digital art group, Factum Foundation, from the 10 known fragments of the original sculpture. The reconstructed statue was installed in a garden in Rome's Capitoline Museums this week, close to where the Temple of Jupiter, the most important temple of ancient Rome, once stood.
"Seeing Constantine, on top of the Capitoline Hill, looking out at the whole of Rome, he feels extraordinary," said Adam Lowe, the founder of the Factum Foundation, which originally created the statue for a 2022 exhibit at the Prada Foundation in Milan.
The head and most of the other fragments of the colossal statue were discovered in 1486, in the ruins of a building not far from the Colosseum. They were transferred to what eventually became the Capitoline collection, and nine of those ancient fragments -- including a monumental head, feet and hand -- are permanently on show at the museums.
The fragments found fame from the moment they were excavated, said Salvatore Settis, an archaeologist and one of the curators of the Prada exhibit. "They have been etched by leading artists from the 15th century on," he said, adding that the sculpture also captured the attention of more modern artists like Robert Rauschenberg, who famously photographed the pieces in the 1950s.
Five hundred years and many more technological advancements later, a team from the Factum Foundation spent three days using photogrammetry, a 3D scan with a camera, to record the fragments in the Capitoline courtyard. Over the course of several months, the high-resolution data became 3D prints, which were used to cast replicas, made of acrylic resin and marble powder.
Those were then integrated with other body parts -- the ones Constantine was missing -- that were constructed after historical research and discussions with curators and experts. A statue of the emperor Claudius as the god Jupiter, now at the ancient Roman altar known as the Ara Pacis, was used as a model for the pose and draping, which was originally in bronze.
"It's through the evidence of those fragments, working rather like forensic scientists, with all the experts from different disciplines, we were able to build back something that is absolutely awe inspiring," Mr. Lowe said, adding that new technologies were offering museums new avenues of research and dissemination.
"We're not trying to build a fake object," he added. "We're trying to build something that physically and emotionally engages and that intellectually stimulates you."
Recent scholarship on the statue has suggested the statue of Constantine was itself reworked from an existing colossus, possibly depicting Jupiter. Irrefutable signs of reworking are especially present on the colossal statue's face, according to Claudio Parisi Presicce, Rome's top municipal art official, the director of the Capitoline Museums and an expert on the colossus.
Indeed, some experts hypothesize that the sculpture was originally the cult statue of a temple devoted to Jupiter -- the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus -- which would mean that the Constantine facsimile has finally returned home.
"We can't be certain that it's the same statue, but there is some possibility that it was," Mr. Settis said. Constantine, the first emperor to convert to Christianity, may have specifically selected a statue of Jupiter to transform into an icon of himself. "That's one hypothesis," he said. "It would mark a passage in Western Europe, from the pagan empire to a Christian one."
The statue will be on show in the Capitoline garden until at least the end of 2025, officials said. Where it will go afterward, and whether it will withstand the ravages of time better than its fractured original, remain open questions.
But its creators at least tried to make it sturdy.
"It'll be as fine as anything is outside," Mr. Lowe said. "We hope. Of course, even during the opening there were pigeons sitting on its head. I'm afraid there's not much you can do about that."

Full text: Gabriella Karefa-Johnson on surviving Ye, quitting Condé Nast and speaking her mind.
When Gabriella Karefa-Johnson, the fashion editor-personality who became famous as the first Black woman to style a Vogue cover (in 2021) and even more famous after she got into a social media brouhaha with Kanye West, was interviewing for her first big fashion job at Vogue, she ended up, not surprisingly, in front of Anna Wintour.
Ms. Wintour asked Ms. Karefa-Johnson where she wanted to be in 10 years. Ms. Karefa-Johnson answered -- as Ms. Wintour once had, when asked a similar question -- editor in chief of Vogue.
Almost exactly a decade later, Ms. Karefa-Johnson doesn't necessarily want that any more.
Last October, after three years as global contributing editor at large, years in which she styled covers that featured Vice President Kamala Harris, the poet Amanda Gorman and Margot Robbie (as "Barbie"), among others, she decided to leave what had once been her dream job. The Israel-Hamas war had begun, and she had become a vocal presence on Instagram protesting what she referred to as the "genocide" in Gaza, despite the aversion of Condé Nast, Vogue's parent company, (and, indeed, that of most of the fashion establishment) to any public pronouncements on the conflict.
"I resigned as kind of a material action of solidarity and because it was just time for me to move on," Ms. Karefa-Johnson, 32, said recently. "Everything I said was attached to the institutions I worked for. Not only was that not fair, it was also distracting."
She had also realized, she said, that she didn't want to be encumbered by the expectations of perhaps the ultimate establishment publication.
"There's so many things that these institutions represent that I'm not," she said. "It works both ways."
It was the final act in a three-year evolution in which Ms. Karefa-Johnson had gone, somewhat unwittingly, from serving a brand to becoming a brand. Now she is trying to figure out what it means to be, as her best friend, Thomas Gebremedhin, the executive editor of Doubleday, said, "untethered" from her former employer.
"I think people are like, 'What are you doing?"' Ms. Karefa-Johnson said. "'Are we working together? Are we not working together? Are you toxic or not?"'
She has effectively become a test case for what it means to be a voice of fashion in a post-magazine world -- a world where the power that was once concentrated in the hands of a few glossy publications is increasingly lodged in the feeds of charismatic individuals, where fashion itself has become part of pop culture, and where personal values are increasingly infiltrating the professional sphere.
But two things tend to happen when an umbilical cord is cut. Either you soar ever upward or you disappear into the chaotic maw of space.
Act I: The Serena Williams Effect
The story of Ms. Karefa-Johnson's emergence as a public figure is essentially a morality play involving unintended consequences, social-justice reckoning and this peculiar social media moment.
"Basically, when I was an assistant, I would go on these shoots with celebrities and famous models, and we would become friends because I was normal and would treat them like normal people," Ms. Karefa-Johnson said. She was talking about women like Bella and Gigi Hadid and Paloma Elsesser, who are part of her inner circle. "They would follow me on Instagram," she said, and when she posted something they liked, they would repost it to their millions of followers.
As she spoke, she was wearing a Public Enemy "Fear of a Black Planet" T-shirt, jeans and Chanel ballet flats and was curled up on the sofa in the living room of the four-story brownstone in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn that she shares with her twin sister, a rapper. She also has an older brother, who is in cybersecurity, and two older sisters. One is a lawyer who works for a social-justice nonprofit in California, where they all grew up, and one is in sports marketing.
Her family is very important to her, she said, especially her maternal grandparents. Her grandmother was the first Black woman to graduate from Yale Divinity School; her grandfather, a doctor, was the first foreign minister of Sierra Leone after it achieved independence from Britain and became a republic. They helped raise her and her siblings after her father, an urban planner, died when she was 7 months old. She pointed to her aunt, who was a model in Europe in the 1960s and '70s, as the reason she first got interested in fashion.
On her mantel, a photo of her grandmother at a World Council of Churches convention abuts a very old Polaroid of Linda Evangelista next to a hand-scribbled note from Miuccia Prada. The house, which is full of auction finds and includes a bedroom that Ms. Karefa-Johnson had transformed into a closet with a full wall of shoes, smelled like quiche, which she had just baked. (She is, Mr. Gebremedhin said, especially good at nachos.)
In 2020, just before Covid-19 brought the world to a standstill, Ms. Karefa-Johnson posted a short video on Instagram Stories (she tends to keep her politics to Stories and her fashion work to regular posts) responding to reactions she had seen to the murder of Ahmaud Arbery. She later summed up her response as: "Health care, education, criminalization of poverty, food deserts -- we live in a world that systemically murders Black people daily. So when I see you talk about being shocked by this, it hurts me and upsets me because this shouldn't be a revelation." Serena Williams, whom Ms. Karefa-Johnson had styled for her Stuart Weitzman ads, reposted it.
Until then, Ms. Karefa-Johnson's guiding principle, especially regarding the fashion world, had been "Just keep my head down and power through and withstand this otherness that I felt pretty constantly and that was overwhelming."
At Vogue, that approach had taken her from assisting Hamish Bowles, an editor at large, to working with Tonne Goodman, then fashion director, and on to becoming the fashion editor of Garage magazine. Even if she felt like an anomaly in a mostly white world as a 5-foot-10, non-sample-size Black woman who was operating, she said, "in a way that nobody else did."
In that glossy world, "there was really strategic value in keeping your cards close to your chest and not talking too much," she said. And she loved to talk.
It was when she started talking online, however, that she realized people were listening, including people who had no interest in fashion. She realized, she said, that "I should take advantage of people listening to try and create the world I hope we can have."
Act II: Talk and Consequences
That is why, when Garage magazine closed and Vogue started wooing her to return, she decided it would be on her terms.
"Magazines were realizing that if they were invested in diversity and inclusion, they needed to actually have people of color working for them," she said.
Ms. Karefa-Johnson has her own theory of tokenism. She grew up in predominantly white spaces, including her California neighborhood; the Thacher School, a boarding school in Ojai, Calif.; and Barnard College in Manhattan. She realized that "everybody had a leg up," she said. "Maybe it's nepotism, maybe it's your dad playing golf with the C.E.O. of LVMH. If diversity and inclusion is my leg up, you work what you have going for you."
At the same time, she went on, "I was contending with these feelings of like, 'OK, I'm trying to get to the top and be respected in an industry full of people whose values don't align with mine, so what does that say about me?' I realized that the only way I could be good with that was if I didn't hide anymore. I'm not going to pretend a part of my personality isn't loud and political and silly and interested in the Housewives and reality TV. And if I experienced pushback -- this person isn't very Vogue, or this is not a Vogue story -- I would fight for it."
There are stylists who are geniuses at creating a fantasy world, stylists who are almost sculptural about images, and stylists who are good with celebrities. Ms. Karefa-Johnson decided she would be a stylist who used fashion like a Trojan horse to deliver points about the politics of race, size and access.
When she was assigned a story about puffer coats, for example, she decided to shoot only Black models in Iceland, to "decolonize the outdoors," she said. She refused to feature Dolce & Gabbana in her stories after the Dolce designers made racist and fat-phobic comments.
"It was definitely not ideal that I worked in a fashion magazine that they support financially and was not willing to shoot their product," she said. And she kept posting her thoughts.
Yet, as Ms. Elsesser said, "There are consequences to representing something different."
Ms. Karefa-Johnson learned exactly what that meant in 2022 when she was in Paris for the shows and went to Ye's newly rebranded YZY collection, which included a "White Lives Matter" T-shirt. Afterward, and for the next few days, she wrestled with that in various posts on her Instagram stories.
The designer, formerly known as Kanye West, was not happy with her and went to war on his Instagram, posting a picture of her with the words "This is not a fashion person" and criticizing her clothes.
"The only reason he thought that he could come for me is because he thought I was not someone who brokered power," Ms. Karefa-Johnson said. "He thought a fat Black woman could not possibly be somebody who has any sway in this industry, and certainly not somebody who works at Vogue. It was humiliating. This super-famous person who I respected despite his shortcomings is validating my worst fear to a huge audience."
Vogue defended her, as it had when her Kamala Harris cover was attacked. People were upset about the picture, which they felt was too casual, and the lighting. The vice president's team remained mum, even though, Ms. Karefa-Johnson said, they had chosen all the clothes.
Act III: Freedom
Her statements about the Israel-Hamas war were more controversial. There were limits, it turned out, to how one can effect change from the inside. So, though Ms. Karefa-Johnson calls Vogue her personal "Roman Empire" and Ms. Wintour "A Dubs"; and though Ms. Goodman raves about her talent and intelligence and says she is one of her "best friends"; and Ms. Wintour says "we are really proud of the work we did together," Ms. Karefa-Johnson decided to leave before her words became a problem. (Ms. Wintour said that Ms. Karefa-Johnson's departure was "entirely her decision.")
"It's a risk," said her mother, Suzanne Karefa-Johnson, a physician with a focus on hospice and palliative medicine, who said she and her daughter had discussed the trade-off between the freedom of going solo and the safety of the institution, especially in light of the aggressive criticism Ms. Karefa-Johnson had received on social media after she spoke out about Israel.
This will be her first ready-to-wear season without the armature of her former employer.
"I feel like I'm going to get, like, Row 7, Seat 45," Ms. Karefa-Johnson said. She isn't sure if the hairstylists and makeup artists she worked with at Vogue will continue to work with her. "The idea that 'I have to make sure you're OK with the powers that be before I work with you' is something I've constantly pushed up against. Now I'm not attached to some of those powerful systems, we'll see what I've got on my own."
In truth, she's not entirely on her own. She has a team of agents at the talent agency WME plotting her next move. She is consulting for Nike, has done design collaborations with Target and Moschino, occasionally models, and is shooting fashion features for independent magazines like Document. In September, she used her contacts to help the young designer Torishéju Dumi stage her first fashion show (she got Naomi Campbell to model), and she is continuing to style Joseph Altuzarra's New York Fashion Week show, as well as Etro in Milan.
She is also writing a book about her experiences. Working title: "Not a Fashion Person."
"So, thank you, Kanye," she said.
Ms. Goodman said she thought Ms. Karefa-Johnson might end up as creative director of a brand. "That could really break open all the issues," she said. Mr. Gebremedhin said, "I could see her going into advocacy work."
Ms. Wintour had a different idea. "I always told her she should have a talk show," she said.

NEW YORK — When Gabriella Karefa-Johnson, the fashion editor-personality who became famous as the first Black woman to style a Vogue cover (in 2021) and even more famous after she got into a social media brouhaha with Kanye West, was interviewing for her first big fashion job at Vogue, she ended up, not surprisingly, in front of Anna Wintour.

​This Florida Mall Has Gucci, Prada … and Soon, Affordable Housing?

BAL HARBOUR, Fla. — In Bal Harbour, an oceanside village north of Miami Beach, a luxury mall says it wants to help tackle one of the nation’s — and Florida’s — most intractable problems: a lack of affordable housing.
It is an unexpected move for a retail temple where Gucci, Chanel and Rolex are on offer. Affordable? Here ?
But in a rare instance of bipartisan agreement, the Florida Legislature passed a law last spring intended to encourage projects like the one that the owner of the mall, Bal Harbour Shops, has in mind. Called the Live Local Act, the law allows developers to bypass certain local zoning rules and to qualify for tax breaks if their projects include enough “workforce housing.”
Local officials around the state, stripped of their power to say no, don’t like it. And nowhere has seen more backlash to date than little Bal Harbour.
For 40 years, the mall’s owner, Whitman Family Development, has wanted to build a hotel alongside the shopping center, on Collins Avenue, the village’s main drag. Neighbors and elected leaders repeatedly rejected the idea. But when the new housing law passed, the owner saw a way in.
The company filed an application last month to build a 20-story hotel and three residential towers with 600 units, 240 of which would be priced low enough to qualify as workforce housing under the law. If the plan meets the law’s requirements, the village of about 3,100 people — where the median household income is about $86,000 a year, well above the state average — will be unable to stop it.
After the application was filed, infuriated residents packed Village Hall to decry the project. The Village Council, feeling ambushed, vowed to try to stop it. Then, last week, the mall’s owner sued the village, in what seems to be the first instance of a developer asking the courts to enforce the new law.
It is a small-town fight over a big-time issue, with both sides making reasonable points and no compromise in sight.
“The law doesn’t make sense, the way it’s being used by the developers,” said Neca Logan, 60, the president of the Bal Harbour Civic Association and a lifelong village resident. “This will change our community for the terrible.”
The law resembles others ​that states have passed in recent years curbing local governments’ ability to block new projects as rent burdens escalate. The hope is to speed construction and backfill what has become a national housing shortage. But around the country, local officials are pushing back.
The Bal Harbour case is the highest-profile dispute yet over the Live Local Act, but it has upset municipalities all over Florida since Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, signed it last March.
Miami Beach balked when the owners of the famed Clevelander Hotel on Ocean Drive floated plans for a restaurant and 30-story residential building. (The owners have since reduced it to 18 stories.) Commissioners in Pasco County, north of Tampa, voted to sue any developer trying to use the law to build apartments on industrial or commercial property. At least two municipalities in Miami-Dade County — Doral and Florida City — temporarily suspended all development after the law’s passage.
Municipal leaders say they are exasperated with the Republican-controlled state government for overriding local authority. State legislators consider the law, which has prompted a slew of shelved developments to be dusted off and redrawn, a resounding success. Developers say that without the law, they would have no incentive to build anything resembling workforce housing.
“I’m the first to admit that including multifamily residential has not been in the plan since its inception,” said Matthew Whitman Lazenby, the CEO of Whitman Family Development, the mall owner. His grandfather, who opened the mall in 1965, had envisioned it as a central village destination with a mix of commercial uses.
“If we can do that while also doing our part to solve a real social crisis,” Lazenby said, “it seems like that’s an opportunity that we shouldn’t refuse.”
The units designated as affordable would be rentals; a mall spokesperson said it was too soon to know the going rate. Lazenby has pointed to hospitality and service workers, teachers, nurses and police officers as examples of people who work in Bal Harbour but cannot afford to live there.
Several employees of stores and restaurants at the mall lamented long, expensive commutes in interviews last week and said they would love to live in Bal Harbour if the rent was within reach. They asked not to be identified because they did not have their employers’ permission to speak to the news media.
Renters in the Miami metropolitan area are the most cost-burdened in the country, according to a new report from the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, which measured how many people spent at least 30% of their household income on housing. The report also found that Florida was the most unaffordable state for renters, followed by Hawaii and Nevada.
Miami has plenty of new rental units, but most are for the luxury market and not for the region’s service economy workers, who are employed by the hospitality, health care and retail sectors, said Ned Murray, the associate director of the Jorge M. Pérez Metropolitan Center at Florida International University. Public-sector employees, such as teachers and police officers, also often are squeezed out.
Anthony De Yurre, a South Florida real estate lawyer who is on the board of governors of the Florida Chamber of Commerce and was involved in shaping the $700 million law, said that what affluent homeowners actually objected to was having less affluent people move into their neighborhoods.
“If you go to these meetings, the first response you get is, ‘We don’t want those people,’” De Yurre said. “These are the same people that are teachers in our communities, service and hospitality folks.”
The law is hardly a cure-all. Under its terms, at least 40% of the housing units in a proposed project must be set aside for people making up to 120% of the local median household income. In Miami-Dade County, 120% of the median is around $90,000 a year. But Murray said that most of the county’s service sector workers earned less than $20 an hour.
“When you do that math, we’re looking at renters that earn between $40,000 and $50,000 a year,” he said, adding that the law is “not addressing that real need.”
Residents and local officials see a different problem: that the law makes it impossible for cities and towns to block out-of-scale projects that would worsen traffic and overwhelm public services. The backlash has been such that state lawmakers are considering amendments to the law intended to address some of the concerns.
“We are very sensitive to climate change and sea rise and the impact on infrastructure, which we deal with every day here,” Mayor Jeffrey P. Freimark of Bal Harbour said. “As a barrier island, adding this type of load to it is, I would argue, unconscionable.”
In 2021, nearly 90% of Bal Harbour residents rejected a referendum put forth by the mall to build higher than its current 56-foot limit, which was set by another referendum in 2006. The newly proposed towers would rise 275 feet — roughly five times higher. The mall owner notes that the St. Regis Bal Harbour Resort, across the street, is about the same height.
On a recent weekday afternoon, Bal Harbour Shops was bustling with local and international visitors enjoying a late lunch or strolling the open-air corridors lined with lush tropical foliage.
The high winter season used to slow down after Jan. 15, Lazenby said, but since 2021 has extended through Valentine’s Day. A previously approved mall expansion — also a sore subject for many residents — was underway, and the surrounding streets were choked with traffic.
“I don’t think anybody’s opposed to having workforce housing in theory,” Logan said, “but not how he’s trying to do it.”

Full text: Socks seem to be everywhere right now, even on the red carpet. But is it really possible to wear them as a grown-up to work and other public situations without looking like a schoolgirl?
Yael, Bronx, N.Y. Socks are, as far as I am concerned, one of the most undervalued, and enjoyable, accessories available. Though socks have long held a place of honor in men's wear as one of the few acceptable ways to express personality, they have played a less meaningful role for women.
That may be because, for decades, socks were associated with school uniforms. Shedding them in favor of stockings (or hosiery) was thus a sign of adulthood. So socks never attained the fashion status they deserve. But that may be changing.
There have always been a few sock champions among the fashion glitterati, most notably Miuccia Prada, who, at age 74, has made something of a signature of wearing short socks with her pumps. Other proponents include Gwyneth Paltrow, who wore sheer black ankle socks with her black heels and black pants to the Armani couture show last week, and Billie Eilish, who wore pink ankle socks with her Mary Janes at the Golden Globes in January.
To join their ranks, you simply need to get over the psychological hump of associating socks with the powerlessness of youth and see them for what they are: comfortable, practical and useful to build an outfit.
Socks can add a pop of color, or a delicate grace note, to a look. They can change a silhouette, elongating the foot if worn in the same color as a shoe and effectively transforming your footwear into an ankle boot. Also, they prevent blisters!
Of course, not all socks are created equal. Socks come in cashmere, cotton, silk, tulle and lamé. Crew socks call up different emotional and historical associations than, say, sheer black socks with matte bands at the top, which have a garter belt vibe.
As for knee socks and pleated skirts, that's when you run into the schoolgirl problem. It's possible to wear the combo with irony, but it may take more effort than it is worth.
Though fashion has, not surprisingly, gotten into the sock action -- Chanel sells a little white pair for $ 375; Gucci has logo-bedecked versions for $ 220 -- there are plenty of more affordable and inventive options. Tabio even personalizes socks.
Whatever kind of socks you choose, just make sure they don't have any holes. That kind of ruins the effect.

Longtime Adherent Of Vintage Fashion: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In July 2022, just before the Balenciaga couture show, Didier Ludot returned from lunch to discover "the longest, most beautiful legs I have ever seen" at his namesake vintage couture boutique in the shopping arcades of the Palais-Royal. They belonged to Nicole Kidman, who was in Paris to walk in the Balenciaga show and was patiently waiting with her husband, Keith Urban.
They spent three hours browsing, with Mr. Urban fetching dresses for his wife, helping her to zip them up and then carefully replacing them on their hangers, prompting Mr. Ludot to jokingly offer him a post as his assistant. "They were a delight," Mr. Ludot, 72, recalled recently.
It's hard to imagine -- now that every red carpet features a "vintage" dress or two, many only a few years old and now that the term has become something of a buzzword for sustainability -- but when Mr. Ludot opened his door in 1974, he was the only boutique owner to curate his stock as if he were collecting couture for an art gallery. As much as anyone, he helped start the current phenomenon. And after 50 years, he has the stories to prove it.
He has always operated the boutique "like an art gallery, except we sell haute couture," Mr. Ludot said. "Everything in the store belongs to me. There is no consignment, I buy every piece outright. It's a galerie de la mode and I am its antique dealer. Next week, for instance, I have a rendezvous to view some Courrèges coats. If I like them and we agree on a price, madame will leave my boutique with her check."
The same month that Ms. Kidman showed up, Julia Roberts arrived in the boutique with her two bulldogs. "I need a coat!" she told him through chattering teeth -- it was an unusually cold summer. She left, he said, warmer and happier in an orange and green check Balenciaga.
"It makes me happy when my customer leaves wearing their acquisition," Mr. Ludot said.
"I love to sell clothes that modern women can actually wear," he said. "Of course I will buy a 1920s beaded Poiret gown, but that's museum quality, too fragile to wear. It will be archived, laid flat, wrapped in tissue and protected from daylight. I prefer to see these beautiful pieces having a second life, worn again -- the raison-d'être of a garment -- admired again and cherished again. Because if vintage couture represents anything, it's the embodiment of emotion."
His boutique -- now 125 square meters (1,345 square feet), triple its original size -- is well known as a showcase for one of the finest collections of vintage couture in the world, a source not only for fashion lovers seeking distinctive pieces, but also for major fashion house designers, museum curators, design students and professional collectors.
Some of the notable celebrities who have found their way there, he said, include Kate Moss, Catherine Deneuve, Stephanie Seymour, Kate Winslet, Demi Moore, Sharon Stone, Lucy Liu, Sarah Paulson, Fan Bingbing, Joanna Lumley, Naomi Campbell and Kris Jenner.
Mr. Ludot said his favorite celebrity memory dates to 2006 and involves a 1956 Christian Dior ball gown in silver tulle, intricately embellished with swaths of satin and fabric roses -- so exquisite that he had intended to keep it for his private collection.
He had just finished placing it in the boutique window when a group of Americans entered, asking its price. He told them it wasn't for sale. When they politely insisted, saying they represented a Hollywood actress, he said 35,000 euros, or about $ 42,700 at the time. Unfazed, they made an appointment for a fitting.
The appointment was for Reese Witherspoon and Mr. Ludot and his husband, Félix Farrington, helped her into the fragile gown. She wore it to the 2006 Academy Awards, where she won best actress for her role as June Carter Cash in "Walk the Line."
"This is the magic moment we live for!" Mr. Ludot said. "This couture ball gown was made to measure by Dior for an unknown woman. Fifty years later, another woman who wasn't even born at the time, steps into the gown and it fits as if was made for her. It brought her luck, too, as she won an Oscar."
As for designers, Karl Lagerfeld, Hubert de Givenchy, Marc Jacobs, Anthony Vaccarello, Pierpaolo Piccioli, Donatella Versace, John Galliano, Calvin Klein and Azzedine Alaïa have been among his regulars.
Hamish Bowles, Vogue's global editor at large, is a frequent visitor, as is Miuccia Prada, who often arrived with Manuela Pavesi, her friend and colleague, until Ms. Pavesi's death in 2015.
"Manuela Pavesi was the most stylish woman I have ever known," Mr. Ludot said. "She'd arrive with diamonds in her hair wearing a fur coat over a pair men's pajamas and men's Westons. She once bought some vinyl Courrèges pieces from me with crocodile skin print. At the next Prada catwalk collection, there they were!
"It's not that they copy or imitate," he added, referring to designers, "they inspire themselves with the best of what they find here."
"Fashion has no memory," said Serge Carreira, director of the emerging brands initiative at Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode and a lecturer at Sciences Po Paris. "Didier Ludot's brilliant curation gives us the time to examine fashion's past."
In 2010, Mr. Ludot was decorated with the Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, a lifetime achievement award for his fashion antiquarian work, presented by the French Ministry of Culture.
That expertise was evident before an auction of some of his private collection early last year as Mr. Ludot examined an Yves Saint Laurent lime green satin jacket, lavishly embroidered by Maison Lesage in a tribute to the French painter Pierre Bonnard.
He pointed out that the jacket had a bolduc d'atelier, or workshop tape, stitched to its interior. To the right of the YSL monogram printed on the tape was the name of Anne Fiona, the model who wore it on the catwalk, and to the left, the label AH88, indicating it was from the fall 1988 couture collection. Both were hand written in black ink.
"This shows that this is the designer's prototype," Mr. Ludot said. "It is the perfect execution of Monsieur Saint Laurent's original vision. The proportions haven't been adjusted to fit a client or modified in any way to her taste."
He had estimated that the piece would sell for around €30,000; it went for €34,112.
It's not the age of a piece that qualifies it as "vintage," he said, it is its singularity, the defining look in a collection that reveals what he described as "the folly and fantasy" of the creator. Some of his choice examples: "Rick Owens' 2015 Sphinx collection. Or Jean Paul Gaultier's 2005 electric blue haute couture African Mask dress, with its Madame Grès-inspired bodice pleating."
On Feb. 25, to mark his 50-year anniversary at the Palais-Royal, Mr. Ludot plans to debut a weeklong retrospective, displaying emblematic pieces by Cristóbal Balenciaga, Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel and Pierre Cardin and Yves Saint Laurent for Christian Dior, alongside contemporary creations from Stéphane Rolland's fall 2023 couture collection, in homage to Maria Callas.
Mr. Ludot said he invited the independent French couturier to be the exhibition's guest of honor because "Stéphane Rolland's architectural creations reassure me and give me hope that haute couture can survive." In that sense, he continued, they are the vintage of the future.

Gucci's Reboot Brings Back Old-School Cool: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The headline was Gucci. The headline was always going to be Gucci, in the same way the Ever Given was destined to dominate the news cycle when the mammoth vessel, one of the largest container ships ever built, got stuck in the Suez Canal back in 2021.
Gucci is, in a way, the Ever Given of the personal luxury goods trade. With more than 500 stores worldwide and an estimated market value in 2022 of $ 35.3 billion, it is that skyscraper-size tanker, caught sideways. The entire fashion business took a hit during the pandemic and then bounced back, or seemed to, with a surprising resilience. Then it encountered something that in its way was as unexpected as that grounding of a nautical behemoth thrown off course by fluke winds.
In Gucci's case it was the fickleness of shifting taste. When Alessandro Michele, the former creative director of the brand -- founded in Florence in 1921 as a leather goods manufacturer catering to a sophisticated carriage trade, and now owned by the luxury goods giant Kering -- said in an interview with this reporter back in 2020 that "maybe one day I will not be relevant," he was sending a signal, to both his bosses and the culture at large.
Mr. Michele was a creative savant and lucky, as he has said, to have survived a quarter century in the business largely by following his instincts (or his "stomach" as he said.) He knew. The instincts that helped elevate him from journeyman accessories designer to star were already giving him the itch to move on. This was largely because society was about to do the same.
The gender play Mr. Michele pioneered -- pussy bows and rhinestones and tiger prints and baby-doll dresses on guys -- and that for a brief, giddy and obscenely profitable moment drove Gucci's valuation to great heights, were absorbed by the culture with alacrity. Harry Styles in a dress on Vogue's November 2020 cover looked groundbreaking for about a minute. Harry Styles in a dress now would hardly rate a second glance.
And the not-so-dirty secret at every luxury goods house is that overall sales are driven not by apparel at all, but by leather goods, and not even costly handbags, at that. It would surprise people to learn how much profit there is in a logo key chain.
Gucci had to right the ship and return it to the mainstream. In attempting to do so, it hired as its new creative director Sabato De Sarno, a man so pragmatic by nature that interviewing him is less like consulting an ancient Greek sibyl, as was the case with Mr. Michele, than it is talking to the director of engineering at a boatyard.
"I love fashion, but I don't love the idea of fashion," Mr. De Sarno said one afternoon before his show. "I want to make things to use and wear, and not just things for shows or red carpet or editorials."
Seen through that lens, he is as much a man of his moment as Mr. Michele was of his. Virtually every fashion house showing in Milan this week made clear its understanding that consumers, particularly young consumers, are through with the hype. Pragmatism was the subtext of the best collections, and those were provided by labels as unalike as Prada, Tod's, Neil Barrett and Brunello Cucinelli. At each of those houses there was an emphasis on craftsmanship, which nowhere is as refined as it is in Italy.
The cliché on the Little Italy T-shirts turns out to be true: Italians Do It Better. Yes, there was the Renaissance. But for present purposes it is the marriage of craft, industrial design and high aesthetic values, which began here in the early 20th century, when the novel idea of providing luxury goods for the masses arose.
Those early designers and, eventually, scores of others put centuries-old artistic traditions to industrial use. It is premature to associate what Mr. De Sarno is doing with the work of giants like the architect and designer Gio Ponti. Yet the impetus is there, and the collection Mr. De Sarno presented -- a follow-up to a heavily-criticized teaser he presented during the women's wear shows in September -- made a strong case for him as a plausible successor to industrial innovators who refuted narrative, and focused instead on materiality and craft.
The knock on the De Sarno Gucci show was that it was commercial, as though there was something wrong with drilling down into the Gucci archives and sampling what he uncovered. There were versions of the original snaffle-bit loafer, interpreted variously as soft and lug soles or else studded brothel creepers; enlarged versions of the celebrated Jackie bag that Samuel Beckett, of all people, once slung over his shoulder; versions of the elegantly tailored outerwear Gucci was renowned for, although rendered in "Through the Looking Glass" volumes.
There were also versions of GG monogram suits in which the logo receded to become a kind of human gift-wrapping, and of previous designers' faux-fur topcoats that made reference to Mr. De Sarno's own love of cozy and protective garb. (He said he has 240 coats in his personal collection; coats are his security blanket.)
"I opened the show with the same coat, the same silhouette, the same bag" as he showed during women's wear, Mr. De Sarno told Vogue.com, as though he were flipping his critics the bird.
"I don't care about the Instagram moment," he added in conversation with this reporter, using saltier language. The Instagram moment, we all know, cannot be avoided. But it is not what floats Sabato De Sarno's boat.

Full text: Bidding on memorabilia from the Emmy-winning drama ended on Saturday, drawing over $ 600,000 in total sales. A viciously mocked tote bag was among the auction's most expensive items.
An auction house in Dallas that is usually stocked with fine art and rare baseball cards now holds a six-foot dog mascot suit last seen in Episode 1 of the HBO drama "Succession." Audiences may recall a nauseated Cousin Greg (Nicholas Braun) putting on the costume and puking through its eyeballs.
The item has been thoroughly cleansed of prop vomit, according to auction staff members, and is now among 236 lots of memorabilia from the show that were sold on the Heritage Auctions website on Saturday. The furry mascot fetched just over $ 7,800.
"Even the eyeholes are mostly clean," said Robert Wilonsky, a spokesman for the auction house.
"Succession," the story of ultrawealthy siblings jockeying for control of their father's media empire, ended its four-season run in May and is up for 27 Emmys on Monday -- the most of any series. Fans and collectors wanting to own a piece of the show were able to bid on luxury suits worn by the show's cast or the vape pen puffed by its Season 4 antagonist, Lukas Matsson (Alexander Skarsgard). Fear not: It comes with a charger.
The auction's most coveted item may have been a boxy Burberry tote ridiculed by Tom Wambsgans (Matthew Macfadyen) when it is carried to a family event by an interloper. "She's brought a ludicrously capacious bag," he says. "What's even in there, huh? Flat shoes for the subway?"
The bag was viciously memed. On Saturday, it was among the auction's most expensive items, and sold for $ 18,750.
Other instruments of humiliation include the Vitamix blender used to douse Kendall Roy (Jeremy Strong) in Season 4 and the prop sausages from a hazing ritual in Season 2 called "boar on the floor." Taxidermy boars from the same scene could not be put up for auction because they are "kind of hard to store," said Monica Jacobs, a prop master for the show.
Even the most mundane props could take weeks to create, Ms. Jacobs said. Credit cards were fabricated specifically for the show -- don't get your hopes up, none of them work -- and handwritten speeches for a funeral scene were scrawled by a member of the show's art department. (Mr. Strong requested to write his own, she added.)
HBO has previously auctioned off props from the shows "Insecure" and "Watchmen," joining A24 and Netflix in a crowded field of Hollywood memorabilia auctions that can generate buzz -- and profits -- long after filming has wrapped.
Sales from the auction totaled $ 627,825, according to Heritage Auctions, and will be shared between HBO and the auction house.
Items for the auction were selected while Season 4 was being filmed in the early months of 2023, said Jax Strobel, a managing director in entertainment for Heritage Auctions. He was invited by HBO to snoop around sets in New York and earmark items -- say, the bayonet sword hanging on the wall of Logan Roy's office -- that should be set aside.
"What will a fan remember or recognize?" he said. "The things that show up often, or that have a special moment or memory attached."
Also up for auction were several of the costumes that helped spawn a frenzy over "stealth wealth" -- the subtle flexing of understated pieces that are in fact quite expensive. See: the brown Brunello Cucinelli blazer worn by Kendall in Season 2, which sold for $ 1,875.
The show's characters "stand for money," Michelle Matland, the costume designer, said in an interview last year. "They stand for affluence. They stand for position and posture."
Ms. Matland dressed them accordingly, beginning with their shoes, which she called "the most important article of clothing on a person's body." Her selections from brands including Prada, Saint Laurent and Lanvin appeared in the auction at various levels of wear and tear.
Some fans of the show grumbled on social media about the markup on a blue children's T-shirt from Walmart worn by Roman Roy (Kieran Culkin) in the series finale. The shirt and a corresponding pair of salmon shorts from Old Navy sold for $ 1,875.
Ms. Jacobs, the prop master, is encouraged that the show's carefully selected signifiers of wealth, status, self-absorption and poor taste are still being appreciated by fans.
Some of them were headaches to procure. She ordered around 20 dried scorpions for the paperweight that Tom gives to Shiv Roy (Sarah Snook) in Season 4, and reshaped their tails into "attack mode." She dried the scorpions in the oven of her apartment before one, cast in resin, enjoyed just a few seconds as a guest star on prestige TV.
The paperweight sold for $ 10,000. "My kitchen smelled terrible for a couple weeks," Ms. Jacobs said, "but it was worth it."
Photograph Items from "Succession" that were auctioned off included, clockwise from above, a mascot suit; a Burberry bag and shoes; a scorpion paperweight; prop sausages; and an ID card and wristwatch.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This year's revamped Golden Globe Awards brought several changes to the program. But it was business as usual on the red carpet, with hundreds of celebrities seemingly relishing the chance to give us something to ogle after last year's strikes stopped many from posing for cameras at award shows and events.
There were ball gowns. There were sequins. There was lots of red -- crimson dresses, candy apple heels, oxblood tuxedos -- with dashes of "Barbie" pink and the color purple.
Aside from maybe Jason Sudeikis, who wore a crew-neck sweater that Styles reporter Jessica Testa said induced "flashbacks to him wearing a hoodie during the awards show-by-Zoom days," almost everyone looked elegant. The 20 people on this list, however, managed to stand out just a little more than others.
Margot Robbie: Most Forever Barbie!
The actress, who wore outfits inspired by the doll's clothes for much of the "Barbie" press tour, continued that streak with a hot-pink Armani Privé gown and a tulle boa that resembled a loofah. The look was inspired by the Superstar Barbie toy.
Jeremy Allen White: Most Freshly Covered Up!
The actor, a star of "The Bear," wore a wide-lapel Calvin Klein suit over a sheer shirt. No items from his recent, nearly naked underwear campaign for Calvin Klein were included, as far as we know.
Da'Vine Joy Randolph: Most Birth of Venus!
The "The Holdovers" actress evoked a modern-day goddess in a maroon Rodarte gown with a sequined shell-style bra that channeled Botticelli's painting.
Hunter Schafer: Most Wispy!
As the actress, who attended the ceremony as a presenter, walked the carpet, her gauzy Prada gown billowed behind her. The look was equal parts eerie and captivating.
Charles Melton: Most Throwback Glamour!
The "May December" actor went with classic formal wear -- specifically, a sharp, double-breasted Armani suit in navy blue, which he accessorized with a watch that had a like-colored face.
Ali Wong: Most 20-20 Vision!
The "Beef" star's white Dior gown had an elegant braided shoulder and it draped beautifully. But her signature eyewear was what made the look sing.
Issa Rae: Most Oscar!
A glittering, floor-length Pamella Roland gown made the actress, a star of "Barbie" and "American Fiction," look a little like the statuette from the Academy Awards. Her glowing complexion enhanced the likeness.
Gillian Anderson: Most Anatomical!
The actress nodded to her role on "Sex Education" in a strapless Gabriela Hearst ball gown featuring dozens of subtly embroidered vulvas (she called them vaginas).
Colman Domingo: Most Embellished!
Two statement brooches added some sparkle to the slim Louis Vuitton suit worn by the actor, a star of "The Color Purple" and "Rustin." A pearl earring dangling from one ear upped the ante.
Florence Pugh: Most Peek-a-Boo!
The actress, a presenter at the ceremony and a star of "Oppenheimer," continued her streak of wearing sheer fabrics with a gauzy Valentino gown that showed some skin beneath its floral appliqués.
Cillian Murphy: Most Lydia Tár!
It looked as if the "Oppenheimer" star had stepped off the set of a different movie ("Maestro") when he arrived on the carpet in a black standing-collar suit and white pleated shirt.
Ayo Edebiri: Most Cherry Lip Balm!
The "The Bear" actress's strapless Prada tube dress might have been the freshest red number of the night. Helping the look pop were a sheer train and a sleek bob hairstyle.
Celine Song: Most Sewn Up!
Sticking through the waistband of the "Past Lives" director's Loewe skirt was a two-foot silver needle. The look, like her film, was understated and had the potential to draw tears.
Barry Keoghan: Most Checkered!
A pearl necklace and belt chain spiced up the "Saltburn" actor's Louis Vuitton jacket and pants -- and helped hide the fact that their prints didn't exactly match.
Billie Eilish: Most Gen Z!
The singer looked thrift-store chic in a boxy Willy Chavarria blazer, a khaki skirt and Mary Janes with socks a similar color to her bangs. She accessorized the outfit by tying a black ribbon from a birthday gift around her neck.
Oprah: Most Literal!
Was her purple Louis Vuitton gown about as surprising as florals for spring? Yes. (Oprah is an executive producer of "The Color Purple.") Did she look regal in the off-the-shoulder, sequined dress? Also yes.
Timothée Chalamet: Most Rock Star!
The actor traded "Wonka" purple for a sparkly black Celine Homme blazer that dazzled with each flash of a camera. His somewhat-buttoned shirt was a departure for someone who often opts not to wear one on the red carpet.
Rosamund Pike: Most Addams Family!
During a preshow interview with Variety, the "Saltburn" actress described her look -- a black tea-length Dior dress with a dramatic, lace veil covering her face -- as having a "weird funeral vibe." In the interview, the actress said that she had a skiing accident this winter and chose to wear the facial covering because she was concerned her injuries would not heal before the awards.
Taylor Swift: Most Mermaid!
Though the singer's "Eras Tour" film was nominated for a Golden Globe, her Gucci gown covered in sparkling chartreuse sequins seemed to be screaming "Reputation" about as loudly as possible.
Ryan Gosling: Most Ken!
She's everything, he's just ... an actor wearing Gucci.

Full text: When is it appropriate to wear a fully matching sweatsuit, top and bottom? When I see people wearing a paired sweatshirt and sweatpants, I sometimes think "cringe." And sometimes I can't help but want to wear it. Which side of me is right?
Pepper, New York Karl Lagerfeld, the Chanel designer whose talent for dramatic pronouncements was equaled only by his talent for dreaming up extraordinary clothes, once declared sweatpants "a sign of defeat."
That pronouncement would suggest that the full sweatpants-and-sweatshirt look, otherwise known as the sweatsuit, a shapeless pairing once synonymous with gym teachers and Rocky Balboa, is ... well, what? A sign of surrender?
Perhaps. Or perhaps, given that this is fashion and in fashion nothing is more certain than that which was out will be in again, it is the embodiment of an ironically triumphant return.
In truth, the sweatsuit has been making a comeback since the coronavirus pandemic. That period, when we prized comfort dressing over just about everything else, converged with Gen Alpha's celebration of all things Y2K, including that era-defining item, the Juicy Couture velour sweatsuit. That discovery was exacerbated by the Miu Miu-driven resurgence of the "set," be it Miuccia Prada's matching crop top and tiny skirt, Versace's shortie pajamas or, yes, the matching sweatsuit of yore.
Demna, the designer of Balenciaga known for reframing the totems of streetwear as luxury, picked up on this idea, embracing not just a signature oversize hoodie but the tracksuit, via his Balenciaga collaboration with Adidas in 2022. It was a slicker, more globalized version of the sweatsuit, and one with its own cultural semiology thanks to hip-hop. Last month, he went a step further and paid homage to the Juicy sweatsuit in his fall 2024 show.
TikTok embraced the trend, with influencers of all sorts discovering the joy of sweats -- they don't call them that exactly; more on that in a moment -- especially as a solution to all things airport.
"Suits" have gotten a bad rap, but the notion of pairing your top and your bottom to create an unbroken line and to suggest coordination aforethought remains an effective approach to dress. The sweatsuit has evolved beyond the usual fleece and baggy proportions and is now available in materials like cashmere and wool, often with smaller tops paired with looser bottoms. I wouldn't use them for jogging, but they are good for swanning around.
The details matter. Wear a sweatsuit with a sweatband and sneakers and you look like a victim of the endless cycle of New Year's workout resolutions. Wear it with a nice handbag and a trench coat and you look like a modern Jean Harlow out to take the air.
It's really a question of framing. Yes, the sweatsuit as we once knew it may be dead, but long live the lounge suit. Or, as influencers like to call it, the "matching sweatsuit set." It's kind of like the reinvention of Target as Tar-gét. Same word, whole new implication.

The Secret Weapon of Celebrity Stylists: [Style Desk]

Full text: What do Queen Camilla, Julia Roberts and Gayle King have in common? Sole Bliss. The brand has become a go to for women who don't want to suffer foot pain.
Helen Mirren declared herself to be "in love with them," and Gabrielle Union said that "they might be the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn in my life." Julia Roberts, Viola Davis and Drew Barrymore have worn them to Hollywood premieres. Queen Camilla owns 13 pairs and wears them at almost all of her public engagements.
Sole Bliss, which began in 2017 making shoes for style-conscious women afflicted by bunions and other foot conditions, is not a brand that conspicuously screams red carpet glamour. But in recent years the small British label has attracted a fan base among celebrities and royalty who are turning to its shoes for high-profile events that require them to be on their feet for hours on end.
Now, as awards season revs up -- the Golden Globes air on Jan. 7 -- Sole Bliss has taken a big step into new territory: collaborations. Its first is with Elizabeth Stewart, a longtime stylist for Ms. Roberts, Cate Blanchett and Jessica Chastain, among other Hollywood heavyweights. Ms. Stewart started offering the shoes in fittings as an experiment after coming across them online in 2020.
"Some of my clients are prepared to suffer for beauty, some aren't," Ms. Stewart said. "But when I started offering Sole Bliss as an option, it was notable how many were coming back and saying they really worked for them and that they were very comfortable."
The shoes are now a key tool in Ms. Stewart's tool kit. "It made sense to put my own stamp on some of the designs I was using the most and make them red-carpet ready," she said. Which meant raising the razzle-dazzle with skyward heels, brighter shades and major sparkles.
Ms. Stewart designed two styles: Royalty, a sexy sky-high platform style in four colors with a block heel and straps that cross at the ankle and a glittering sole ( $ 399); and Premiere, a patent leather sling-back with a pointed toe that comes in six colors and is more suited to daytime events ( $ 349).
The footbed technology Sole Bliss employs involves three layers of foam, hidden stretch panels and wide toe boxes. Lisa Kay, the company's founder, spent five years perfecting the design with podiatrists and testing it through market research. A veteran of the leather accessories industry, she started Sole Bliss after developing a painful bunion and finding few options available for women who still wanted to wear heels.
"It was madness to me that millions of women were being relegated to traditional comfort footwear with no fashionable alternatives," she said. "I felt confident that there would be massive demand given the gap in the market and how many people suffer from foot problems."
With the first lockdowns of the pandemic (when the company also started a line of sneakers), the Sole Bliss customer base expanded well beyond those with corns, bunions and hammer toes, Ms. Kay said. The shoes were embraced by those who prioritized comfort over glitzy brand names, including many celebrities. Queen Camilla has worn a solid and sensible style called the Ingrid, which costs $ 299 and is the company's best-seller, more than 80 times and even recommended them to "The Great British Bake Off" star Dame Mary Berry, who is now a devotee.
Ms. Mirren wore the Pandora style for the opening night of the Cannes Film Festival this year, and after Gayle King, the television host, posted about the Rubys style she wore to a film premiere in July, "the phone rang off the hook," Ms. Kay said. Younger fans include Amanda Seyfried, Jodie Comer and Rebel Wilson.
After hearing about Sole Bliss this writer (who generally prefers her feet flat to the floor) was prepared to test-drive a gold pair of the Ruby style at a festive holiday party that went into the early hours.
The 3.5-inch heels, which have a passing resemblance to Prada's signature chunky platform sandals that sell for four times the price, were indeed comfortable. At 2 a.m., there was none of the inevitable throbbing ache in the balls of the feet, no pinched toes or aching heels.
Ms. Stewart has no qualms about bringing Sole Bliss more fully into the spotlight.
"There is no greater test of a high heel than a Hollywood awards ceremony," she said. "Very few people get to wear the couture gowns seen on the red carpet, and this is an ordinary brand with shoes designed for regular women. I like to be the decision maker who gets to put them together when the eyes of the world are watching."

Admire the Performance, if Not the Flawed Character: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As the brilliant but flawed Kitty Oppenheimer, the actress plays a woman who had "extraordinary qualities, as well as ones that really let her down as a person."
In "Oppenheimer," the writer and director Christopher Nolan's summer blockbuster biopic -- three words that generally don't go together -- the character of Kitty Oppenheimer is effaced twice over.
Kitty, played by Emily Blunt, is the woman behind the man: Though a scientist herself, she is the sidelined wife of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), the American physicist who led the development of an atomic weapon during World War II at Los Alamos, N.M. "Oppenheimer" is emphatically his movie, so much so that a lot of the script was written in the first person ("I OPEN my eyes- JUMP out of bed- SCRAMBLE to dress").
And second, though Kitty was Robert's wife (they had two children together), she was not his first love nor, the film suggests, his strongest. The psychiatrist Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) was initially involved with Robert for three years, and the two continued to see each other, even after the Oppenheimers were married. Midway through the film, Kitty finds her husband manic over her death.
"How heartbreaking it must have been for her," Blunt said, "to see him in that kind of state about another woman."
It is all to say that Blunt, the London-born actress known for films such as "The Devil Wears Prada," "Mary Poppins Returns" and "A Quiet Place," might have disappeared into the three-hour epic, which was based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography "American Prometheus." But Blunt's is among the most memorable performances in a film packed with movie stars and acclaimed character actors. The winner of a Screen Actors Guild Award for "A Quiet Place" in 2019, Blunt is now a likely candidate for her first Academy Award nomination.
In a video interview last month, she talked about sympathetically portraying an unfortunate but not exactly likable character. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Christopher Nolan asked actors to learn about their real-life characters. What about Kitty Oppenheimer informed your performance?
We all read "American Prometheus." On the flight out to Albuquerque, I could see other people trying to cram it. The wives in Los Alamos described her as being one of the most evil people they've ever met. Men were intrigued by her but a bit intimidated. Kitty didn't do small talk. She only did big talk.
Robert and Kitty Oppenheimer temporarily offloaded their baby son to their friends, the Chevaliers, because they were so overwhelmed. Was that scene difficult to perform?
I have 9- and 7-year-old girls, and I adore being a mom. I've always really loved kids. So it's quite hard to be so cold-shouldered with these little ones on set. Kitty's clearly got trauma there -- trauma that wasn't named at the time. She has descended into drinking too much. I tried to empathize with the woman who was in possession of a phenomenal brain herself, who is having to contort herself into the good housewife-y. It must have been agony for someone like her, who was so wild, so brilliant, should never have been a mother, and clearly had huge depression after the kid was born.
How do you balance empathy with being true to the character, potentially at the expense of likability?
For me, it's never important if someone is likable. I just have to understand them. I could play that quiet desperation of the character, the restlessness and that unashamed flair that she had, which was so fiery and exciting. And yet she was this very stabilizing force for him. She was his most vigorous protector. I think she had rather extraordinary qualities, as well as ones that really let her down as a person. She is abrasive and flawed, but I really sympathized with that idea of someone deteriorating at the ironing board, when she should have been made for intellectual endeavors that would have thrilled her.
Were there any other scenes that unlocked Kitty for you?
Do you remember the scene under the rock with Cillian? He's gibbering with incoherence about his lover.
When I read the scene, I was like, "Wow, that's so interesting, it's almost like he can't see that he's speaking to his wife." And I slapped him -- Chris was like, "Slap him." It's not in the movie, but I hit that famous cheekbone way too many times. Maybe what I played more is her attempt to save face. Like: "Pull yourself together, people here depend on you." It's more like, "I depend on you."
How did the unconventional, first-person nature of the screenplay influence how you approached the role?
It was made clear to all of us that this is a single perspective. Oppenheimer's character is going to reach through the screen and pull you inside of his head, and you've got these rather more wild, colorful characters around him. We were there to emotionally elicit different sides of this character.
I interviewed Nolan shortly before "Oppenheimer" was released about the IMAX 70-millimeter format.
It must have been like Dork Central for him. The passion about film is infectious.
What was it like shooting with the IMAX cameras?
It would be brought in like a massive fridge. And it's loud: It sounds like Chewbacca coming in. There's something freeing, because you know that it's going to capture every little flicker and nuance on anyone's face. But it is loud, and at first you're like, "How am I going to function?" It's the understated nature of Chris's sets, the focus and lack of chaos, that it was never this declamatory moment when the IMAX would come in.
How would you contrast Nolan's "calm" sets with others you've been on?
On some sets you're flying by the seat of your pants. It can work both ways: With a comedy or something that's more free-spirited, sometimes it's great for it to be a bit more chaotic. But with Chris, it's his preparation, so that when you show up, you don't feel rushed as an actor. I'm sure the crew was horizontal every night by 7 p.m.

The Man Who Destroys Luxury Handbags: [Style Desk]

Full text: Under the handle Tanner Leatherstein, Volkan Yilmaz rips, burns and slices apart luxury goods to show how much he thinks they are really worth.
One video opens with a large white leather handbag covered in the signature LV logo of Louis Vuitton. Within milliseconds, a hand with a switchblade swoops in and slashes a huge gash in the side of the bag before tearing it apart at its seams. In another, the distinctive red sole of Christian Louboutin is loudly ripped from a black stiletto using a wrench; in still another, scissors snip through a $ 2,200 Prada clutch before a man sets fire to a piece of the leather and turns it to ash.
You've entered the TikTok world of Tanner Leatherstein, which has more than 950,000 followers. Leatherstein, whose real name is Volkan Yilmaz, has attracted a cult following on the social media platform -- as well as on YouTube and Instagram -- for his butchering of exorbitantly expensive items. The reason, he says, is to show his viewers the true quality of the materials and craftsmanship and then break down how much the item may have cost to make.
"In many cases," Mr. Yilmaz said from his Dallas workshop in December, "my estimates come in at about a tenth of what the price tag says. The markups that underpin the luxury business still shock a lot of people."
In the edited interview below, Mr. Yilmaz, 37, discussed his lifelong obsession with leather, how much he spends on luxury products for his platform and what people should look for when buying new leather items.
When did your love of leather goods begin?
My family owned a tannery in Turkey, so I was born into the business. Around 11, I tanned five sheepskins to make my first leather jacket. While at college in Istanbul, I worked at the tannery, then went to China to learn about leather imports and exports and then to Turkmenistan.
In 2009, I won the U.S. green card lottery and moved to Chicago. I drove a cab while I got an MBA from the University of Illinois, then worked as a management consultant, which made me feel like I was dying inside. I was still obsessed with leather, so I started my own leather brand called Pegai, teaching myself about the design side from YouTube and driving Uber jobs to make ends meet. In 2019, once the business was underway, I moved to Dallas.
Why did you start creating social media content?
Friends and even friends of friends have always asked me to check their leather purchases. What do I think of the quality? Have they paid too much?
It made me realize that people don't actually know that much about how leather is sourced or used and are suspicious about the markups on luxury leather products. So I started making some videos to answer their questions. I didn't expect them to blow up the way they have.
More than anything else, you are known for slicing up bags. Why do you do that?
When I started dissecting bags, I wanted to show that price really wasn't about the leather or the materials used -- that it was mostly about the status associated with a label. So many people automatically assume that if it's expensive, it must be good.
What was the first bag you ever cut up?
It was a Louis Vuitton briefcase. Louis Vuitton is one of the most famous leather brands in the world, but many people don't know that the iconic LV monogram material is actually canvas. The first video that went viral was a little $ 1,200 wallet from Chanel. From then on, requests to feature different brands have been rolling in nonstop.
What are you looking for when you slash a bag?
The leather quality, of course. How it has been tanned. I use acetone to remove the finish, and I can see how much plastic makeup has been applied to the leather. I burn the leather to assess what tanning process has been used. Then I look at the craftsmanship, which is reflected in the stitching, hardware and construction.
A big part of what I do is assessing the brand's claims. A bag might look good from the outside, but when you rip it open and look inside, it tells another story.
Who are the almost two million followers you have on social media?
There is definitely a demographic who hate luxury brands, full stop, who think the pricing is a scam and that people who pay for them are stupid. Then there are people who just love the entertainment value of chopping up expensive products. But many people are watching the videos because they love luxury and want a better understanding of quality products. They want to assess their luxury or vintage purchases with their eyes open.
Which brands are worth the money?
Bottega Veneta uses incredible leathers, and I've done three or four videos on their beautiful products. Though in one video -- on a $ 650 wallet -- I cut it up, and the lining was made from a lower quality leather than the one described on the label. (Bottega did not respond to a request for comment).
I really like a Scottish label called Strathberry. They make their products in Ubrique, which is this small town in Spain where brands like Loewe and Dior make their goods. But Strathberry is a fraction of the cost -- more like $ 500 instead of $ 3,000. Polene is another great label made by people who really know what they are doing. Coach is pretty good at a mid-price point.
Are you ever shocked by what you find?
I don't get positively shocked -- I'm paying a lot of money. Great if we can show a bag to be great material and design, but that should be the standard.
Do brands reach out to you now?
Not really, and especially not from the luxury space. I don't accept free items or advertising opportunities. People will trust me only if I stay totally independent.
Lots of people will have given or received leather goods during the holidays. Any tips for them?
Trust your senses. Feel it. If it feels plasticky, that's not a good sign. Smell it. There isn't only one leather smell, but there is a pleasant, slightly earthy aroma to quality leather. It should not smell like chemicals.
Look at it. Leather is an animal-sourced product. It has variations to its grain and fiber structure. The more variations you see in the fabric, the more natural and untreated it is. If it's overdone with a heavy finish, leather becomes very standardized and lower quality hides can be hidden.

The Year Fashion Went Backward: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Skinny models. White male designers. Shoulder pads. This year, fashion failed on many of its promises.
It started with all the talk about how we were going back. Back to the office. Back to normalcy after two years of pandemic upheavals. Back to -- maybe -- actual dressing. Remember?
Turns out, when it came to fashion, one part of that was exactly right. In 2023, we went back. And not just to big 1980s shoulders and bigger Edwardian sleeves or even Y2K trends: low-rise cargos, cropped tops, Uggs.
But back to skinny models. Back to mostly white men getting the top jobs at big fashion brands. Back to the flying circus of destination show spectacles. Back to fast fashion. Backward.
With great influence (influence being the currency of fashion as it intersects with culture) comes great responsibility, to paraphrase both Spider-Man and Winston Churchill. Yet for an industry that is supposed to be about the future, it was an awfully retrograde year.
After a messy period of confusion about what happens next -- maybe the metaverse, with all that implies about identity and self-expression and clothes; maybe a change in the system so we could right-season and get sales under control; definitely a future dedicated to inclusivity, diversity and cultural sensitivity -- fashion is, in many ways, in the same place it was in 2019.
The first sign was on the runways. Despite real change when it comes to racial inclusivity, size inclusivity was practically nonexistent. According to Vogue Business, "95.6 percent of looks" in the fall 2023 shows, which took place in February and March, were between US size 0 and 4. Only 0.6 percent were plus size (defined as size 14 and up; the remaining 3.8 percent were midsize, or size 6 to 12).
In the most recent spring 2024 shows, held in September and October, 0.9 percent of the models were plus size, while 3.9 percent were midsize. That doesn't even begin to take into account the narrow representations of age and physical ability.
Backstage at many shows, chaos and public nudity, decried during the immediate aftermath of the #MeToo movement, returned. The Fashion Worker's Act, a bill introduced in New York to address the rights of models and other contract workers, fell victim to legislative gridlock and was tabled in the State Assembly until next year.
By summer, it was clear that despite the pandemic-induced hiccup in the show system, there would not be fewer shows; there would be more, involving more travel, more hoopla and more products. Not only did brands that had resisted coming back, like Ralph Lauren, stage a return to the official schedules, but mega-brands like Dior and Vuitton added new interim shows to their circuit -- Dior holding its prefall show in Mumbai and Vuitton, men's prefall in Hong Kong.
And those were just two of the destination blowouts that took place. Others included Carolina Herrera in Rio, Gucci in Seoul, MaxMara in Stockholm, Boss in Miami.
"We didn't really learn anything from Covid-19," Pierpaolo Piccioli of Valentino told me in late 2022, and it was clear he was right.
Come October, a flurry of new designer appointments took place, and though the arrival of Pharrell Williams at Louis Vuitton men's wear in February had been an unmistakable jolt to the status quo, it turned out to be the exception, not the rule. Among the nine designers named to big jobs in 2023, there was one woman (Chemena Kamali at Chloé), one person of color (Mr. Williams) and seven white men. Many of those men didn't just have similar resumes, they had similar facial hair.
Finally, at her spring show and at COP28, Stella McCartney showcased new materials -- biodegradable sequins! Biofluff plant-based-fur! -- but evidence suggests that promising as they are, such pilots are not scalable enough to make any real difference. Mylo, the mushroom leather Ms. McCartney championed in 2021 and 2022, was discontinued by its parent company, Bolt Threads, and Renewcell, the largest textile-to-textile recycling plant in the world, is pausing production, both for lack of demand. Despite incremental advances from LVMH and the members of the Fashion Pact like Kering and Prada, the industry has yet to grapple with its most elemental issue: its sheer amount of stuff.
Indeed, speaking of stuff, Shein, the biggest and fastest of the ultrafast fashion giants, recently valued at $ 66 billion, reportedly filed to go public, suggesting that no one thinks the consumption model is going away any time soon. Nor are the problems with supply chains. Transparentem, a nonprofit that focuses on environmental and human rights abuses, recently released a new investigation highlighting wage slavery in factories in Mauritius that produce goods for, among other Western brands, Diesel, Armani and PVH, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. While some of those brands have been responsive to the findings and worked to remediate the situation, others have remained silent.
"We had a phase of awareness," said Achim Berg, a senior partner at McKinsey & Company and one of the leaders of McKinsey's global Apparel, Fashion & Luxury Group. "Then a phase of commitment." But we have not, he said, made enough of a leap to action. Instead, fashion, nervous in the face of an uncertain political and economic environment, is crossing its fingers, hoping technology comes to the rescue, and defaulting to the familiar while it waits.
Still, looking ahead to 2024, there are some glimmers of disruption. The recent return of full-on red carpet eccentricity after the SAG-AFTRA strike has been a reminder of the joy, and complexities, of dressing up, suggesting this could be an awards season to remember. The chaos of New York Fashion Week, full of upstart brands by nontraditional designers defining success on their own terms and with their own fan base, is exciting.
The big brands that made the most waves -- Loewe, Bottega Veneta and Miu Miu -- did so because of their inherent idiosyncrasy, the willingness of the designers Jonathan Anderson, Matthieu Blazy and Miuccia Prada to pave their own peculiar paths. To, for example, change the silhouette by redefining high-rise pants (Loewe) or transforming leather pants into denim (Blazy) or getting rid of pants entirely (Miu Miu). Phoebe Philo came back under her own name and in her own way: online, without any formal marketing fanfare, at the most luxurious of price points, practically demanding her clothes be viewed as long-term investments.
Maybe it will work. Maybe it won't. But at least she's trying something new.

The Most Stylish People (And More) of 2023: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The "people" on this list -- who are presented in no particular order -- reflect the ways that the Styles desk defines its coverage: high and low; fun and serious; curious and open-minded; reveling in characters; appreciating the material world; inviting everyone to the party.
Many were recognized for being Styles-ish, others for being stylish. (Several could not have done it without the help of stylists, costume designers and other crews.) Lots came from the worlds of politics, film, TV, music, sports and fashion. But a few caught our attention in less expected places, like courtrooms.
Some had great hair. Some had singular accessories. One person had both -- and was mistaken for a duchess in disguise. Certain people might surprise you or (we hope) inspire heated debate. After all, one thing they had in common is they made us talk: about what we wear, how we live and how we express ourselves.
Michelle Yeoh
The actress made history at the Oscars, became a face of Balenciaga and stood out on every red carpet.
Beyoncé
Her wardrobe for the Renaissance tour featured almost an entire season's worth of couture looks.
Phoebe Philo
Six years after leaving Celine, fashion's prodigal daughter returned with a namesake brand sold only online. Fans lost their minds, some over what they felt were high prices.
Frances Tiafoe
Big Foe, as the tennis player is known, scored big style points when he played the Australian Open in his colorful lava-lamp-like kit.
P.J. and Josie in 'Bottoms'
P.J., played by Rachel Sennott, and Josie, played by Ayo Edebiri, helped to usher in a rugby shirt renaissance.
NewJeans
With a sound inspired by late '90s and early 2000s R&B, the bunny-ears-wearing members of NewJeans climbed to the top of Billboard charts and earned various distinctions -- including being the first female K-pop act to play Lollapalooza.
Representative Patrick McHenry of North Carolina
A silver lining of watching the many House speaker votes? Seeing the outgoing Republican congressman's various bow ties.
Jeff Bezos' Schooner
When the boat set sail, many started to see Lauren Sánchez, the former news anchor who became engaged to the Amazon founder in May, in its figurehead. In an interview with Vogue, she denied it was her likeness, suggesting that if the figurehead were inspired by her, it would have bigger breasts.
Travis Kelce
Proximity to a certain pop star has made the Kansas City Chiefs tight end a household name -- and a desirable billboard for labels like KidSuper.
Doja Cat
The singer and rapper has made an art form of altering her image, using prosthetics (and an Oscar de la Renta gown) to evoke Karl Lagerfeld's cat at the Met Gala and covering herself in ruby crystals to complete her fiery look at a Schiaparelli couture show.
Dylan Mulvaney
The transgender influencer did not let critics of her Bud Light campaign stop her from gracing red carpets at events like the Tony Awards, where she sparkled in a semi-sheer gown.
Pharrell Williams
Since taking over men's wear at Louis Vuitton, he has tapped (a pregnant) Rihanna for an ad campaign and has designed a $ 1 million handbag.
Gwyneth Paltrow
Perhaps the only thing more talked about than her clothes at her ski crash trial were her courtroom quips, like "Well, I lost half a day of skiing," which inspired a wave of T-shirts and other merchandise.
The Sphere
Las Vegas's new arena has become the biggest visual spectacle in a city full of them.
Alan Cumming in 'The Traitors'
As host of the murderous reality TV competition, the actor gave a master class in men's wear.
Lauryn Hill
Her tour celebrating the 25th anniversary of her album "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill" treated fans to nostalgia and some pretty neat costumes.
Paul Mescal
His commitment to -- and command of -- the mullet was remarkable.
The Ludicrously Capacious Bag in 'Succession'
As Tom Wambsgans said in the show: "What's even in there, huh? Flat shoes for the subway? Her lunch pail? I mean ... it's monstrous. It's gargantuan. You could take it camping. You could slide it across the floor after a bank job."
Jacob Elordi
Onscreen and off, the actor has surprised people with his accessories (that eyebrow piercing in "Saltburn") and lack thereof (walking barefoot in Los Angeles). But his best accessorizing by far has been with handbags big and small.
State Representative Justin Jones of Tennessee
The Democratic lawmaker's white suit became a potent political symbol when he was briefly expelled from the Tennessee legislature over a protest for gun control.
Lily Gladstone
On red carpets, the breakout star of "Killers of the Flower Moon" has a knack for mixing luxury fashion with pieces from independent and Native American designers.
M3GAN in 'M3GAN'
The twisted doll had a killer outfit.
Greta Lee
The "Past Lives" actress dresses with a fearlessness that makes fashion fun. Her return to red carpets was among the many benefits of ending the actors' union strike.
King Charles III
He finally got to wear St. Edward's Crown.
Ice Spice
The rapper known for her red Afro was the inspiration for a diamond necklace, a drink at Dunkin' and lots of Halloween costumes.
Maggie Smith
Her Loewe campaign was one the fashion world didn't know it needed.
The A.I. Pope
Few of the artificially generated images that have flooded social media feeds were as fly as the rendering of Pope Francis in that puffer.
Jenna Lyons
If nothing else, the "Real Housewives of New York City" reboot was a platform to remind people how well she executes high-low style.
Jerrod Carmichael
Remember how many great outfits the comedian wore as host of the Golden Globes?
Prince Hussein and Princess Rajwa of Jordan
There was a lot of fashion at their royal wedding, but the bride and groom might have dressed the best.
Law Roach
He quit styling A-list celebrities. Or did he? Either way, he garnered a ton of attention for a job that's mostly behind the scenes.
Kristen Kish
She's the new host of "Top Chef," which hopefully means more opportunities to see her in top-notch tailoring.
Jimmy Butler
After the Miami Heat lost the N.B.A. championship, the forward kicked off a new season with a new (temporary) emo look that included facial piercings, black nail polish and 2007-era Pete Wentz hair.
Gaurav Gupta
The Indian couturier, who started his line some 20 years ago, was invited to show at Paris Couture Week for the first time. He also made the atmospheric blue gown Cardi B wore to the Grammys.
Troye Sivan
The capstone of his stylish year? When Timothée Chalamet and the band boygenius replicated a look from the singer's "Got Me Started" video -- a tight white tank, baggy blue pants and red undies -- on "Saturday Night Live."
Mark Zuckerberg
He bulked up. And he might have agreed to a cage match with Elon Musk?
Ariana Madix
The "Vanderpump Rules" cast member came out of "Scandoval" with a cover of Glamour -- and possibly looking better than ever.
Amy Lau in 'Beef'
As Amy, played by Ali Wong, unraveled, her changing hair and wardrobe perfectly captured her emotional state.
Karl Jenkins
May he forever be known as the man who is not Meghan Markle.
Mary Earps
With help from passionate fans, the keeper for England's national women's soccer team got Nike to issue versions of her Women's World Cup jersey after the company initially said it wouldn't.
Pedro Pascal
His rugged physique, along with paternal roles in "The Last of Us" and "The Mandalorian," helped him become the internet's daddy.
Martha Stewart
Was posing for the cover of Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue at 81 a bit gimmicky? Yes. Should she have any regrets? No.
Chioma Nnadi
The new top editor of British Vogue, who took over this fall after rising to become a trusted deputy of Anna Wintour during her roughly 13 years at American Vogue, is the first Black woman to lead the publication.
Miuccia Prada
Close followers of fashion have said that no other designer has been more influential lately.
President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea
His pitch-perfect performance of "American Pie" at the White House was worthy of "American Idol."
Olivia Rodrigo
A rock star for Gen Z, she embodies her cohort's love of Doc Martens and vintage, wearing archival pieces on red carpets at award shows and other events.
Chirlane McCray and Bill de Blasio
They navigated some big personal changes -- their separation as a couple, his newly dyed hair -- with admirable transparency.
Pamela Anderson
Between her memoir, her documentary and her makeup-free face at Paris Fashion Week, she pretty much bared it all.
Barbie in 'Barbie'
Each Barbie in the film was as put together as the last.
Margot Robbie
But of all the people who played Barbie onscreen, none had as many moments on the pink carpet as Margot Robbie.
Sofia Richie Grainge
Bridal mood boards have not been the same since she wore a trio of custom Chanel dresses at her April wedding.
Ariana DeBose
Her show-opening rap at the BAFTA Awards was the definition of an earworm.
Lauren Wasser
Among the achievements notched by the model with golden prosthetic legs: a cover of CR Fashion Book, a Giorgio Armani campaign and a Women of the Year Award from Glamour Germany.
Robert Oppenheimer in 'Oppenheimer'
Fedoras, trilbies and their ilk had a bit of a boom thanks to the theoretical physicist played by Cillian Murphy.
E. Jean Carroll
At her civil trial against former President Donald J. Trump, she supplemented her testimony with a statement-making wardrobe.
Tems
Lots of eyes were on the singer at the Oscars, partly because her gravity-defying gown blocked some guests' view of the stage.
David and Victoria Beckham
The couple may be serious about their clothes, but as their Netflix documentary series showed, they don't always take themselves too seriously.
The Cockroach at the Met Gala
The cockroach owned that red carpet -- until it got squished.
Cher
She started dating a younger man and, with the release of a new Christmas album, tried to steal the holiday from another diva (Mariah Carey).
Pamela in "Saltburn"
Pamela, played by Carey Mulligan, had the clothes of Moira Rose and the hair of Grace Coddington.
Coco Gauff
The U.S. Open champion's electric separates at the tennis tournament were almost as exhilarating as her performance on the court.
Taylor Swift
Chances are she got someone you know to start wearing friendship bracelets or Kansas City Chiefs gear.
Rihanna
Though she's still keeping fans waiting for a new album, she did deliver an epic performance at the Super Bowl halftime show, where she revealed her second pregnancy while wearing a red Loewe jumpsuit, replicas of which the brand later sold -- and quickly sold out of.
The 71 entries on this list were chosen from an initial pool of some 250 submitted by Styles staff members. The larger pool was winnowed in meetings and video calls that were not without passionate debate. To those who did not make the cut, 2024 is just a few weeks away -- and we'll be watching.

Full text: The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute reimagines the record of fashion, celebrating designers known but also those long, and wrongly, forgotten.
Last October, when it was announced that Sarah Burton was leaving Alexander McQueen, the house she had nurtured to new gorgeousness after the suicide of its founder, and would be replaced by an Irish designer named Seán McGirr, it set off a sort of tsunami of angst in the fashion world.
See, it turned out that with McGirr's appointment, every designer in the stable of its owner, Kering, the second-largest fashion conglomerate in the world, would be a white man. And it only got worse when, in quick succession, three more white men, all Italians, were named to the top jobs at Moschino, Tod's and Rochas.
Where were the women (not to mention the designers of color), in an industry that largely caters to women? Weren't we supposed to have moved beyond this? Cue the breast-beating and TikTok wailing.
And then, cue the corrective, which comes courtesy of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute.
"Women Dressing Women" is a celebration of work from the museum's own collection by over 70 different female designers from the early 20th century to the present. It is the first time the museum has ever held a survey dedicated solely to the work of women, and it will be the first time that at least half of the 83 pieces on display have ever been seen.
That makes the show both a symptom of the problem (it's kind of shocking to think that in the 85 years since the Costume Institute joined the Met no one has done this before, despite the complications of a show based on gender) and, perhaps, a signpost for a possible solution.
Indeed, rarely has an exhibition been more perfectly timed. Even if Mellissa Huber, the associate curator of the Costume Institute, who created the show along with Karen Van Godtsenhoven, the guest co-curator, did not intend it that way.
Intended to coincide with the 100th anniversary of women's suffrage in the United States in 2020, "Women" was conceived in 2019 and postponed when Covid lockdowns changed the exhibition schedule. That delay has recast the result in a way that makes it feel, ironically, even more politically relevant, not just because of developments in the fashion world, but because global events have renewed the debate over women's bodies and who controls them.
The miracle is that Huber and Van Godtsenhoven have avoided polemics in favor of simply letting the work, in all its astounding variety and breadth of imagination, speak for itself. And it does.
In whispers and songs, silk faille and satin, cotton and wool, it reimagines the record of fashion, filling in the gaps and wardrobes of history with names and pieces long, and wrongly, forgotten; elevating them, finally, to the pedestals on which they belong.
Literally: the show opens with two tall columns as you descend the steps to the Anna Wintour Costume Center.
Atop each column are pieces by the only two female designers to be granted solo shows at the Met: a draped white goddess evening gown from Madame Grès, whose retrospective finally took place in 1994 -- despite the fact that the former Costume Institute curator Diana Vreeland began advocating for it in 1980, according to Huber -- and a black moth-eaten sweater and skirt from the avant-gardist Rei Kawakubo, whose retrospective occurred in 2017.
Meanwhile, what greets attendees when they reach the Costume Center itself is three sumptuous black gowns from the troika of fashion wisewomen, Coco Chanel (a "fireworks" tulle dress, glittering with sequined starbursts), Madeleine Vionnet (a dark brown velvet column with a gold beaded "ribbon" at the waist) and Elsa Schiaparelli (a midnight blue velvet embroidered evening jacket and skirt). Set in a mirrored triangle that refracts the work in an endless loop, this one-two opener drives home the point: Everywhere you look there are works by women at the top of their game.
That the message is conveyed so subtly is what gives the exhibit its power. This is a damning story, gently told. The revelations begin in the Carl and Iris Barrel Apfel Gallery, which focuses on that time, in the 1920s and '30s, when female designers actually outnumbered men, and serves up introductions to many names that have been lost to history.
Premet, for example. What's that? A French house led by a series of women designers, all of whom introduced iterations of the little black dress starting in 1923, a few years before Coco Chanel is credited with its invention. On view is one of their many LBDs, a graceful tiered number from 1929 by the designer Charlotte Larrazet.
And what about Marie-Louise Boulanger (of the house of Louiseboulanger)? She was responsible for the extraordinary dropped-waist beige satin frock being shown, the skirt a highly contemporary mix of straw and ombré dyed ostrich plumes. Or Mad Carpentier, the house co-founded by Madeleine Maltezos and Suzie Carpentier, the women behind a draped organdy gown from the late 1940s that undulates in shades of blue like the surface of the Mediterranean Sea?
It's impossible to see their work and not think that they should be part of the general designer canon -- and that if they were, perhaps our understanding of the foundations of the modern fashion world might be different.
A video of seamstresses bent over their machines, reminder of all the anonymous women who found their livelihood in fashion, provides the bridge from these foundational creators to the world of ready-to-wear: a 360-degree vision housed in the Lizzie and Jonathan Tisch Gallery and anchored by an amethyst velvet Maria Monaci Gallenga gown from 1925 strewn with gold lotus blossoms. Previously attributed to Mariano Fortuny (oops) and in fragile condition, it has been repaired and is making its exhibition debut.
From there the show takes you on a whistle-stop tour through the kaleidoscope of female imagination contained in clothing, leapfrogging through Ann Demeulemeester's appropriation of the undertaker's suit and Donna Karan's cold-shoulder gown, Norma Kamali's parachute ruching and the draped chiffon of the Indigenous designer Jamie Okuma. The galleries are so multilayered with identities and invention it can be hard to keep track of who made what, though it's fine to just abandon yourself to enjoyment.
There is unexpected delight in discovering the web of connections the show uncovers, both in the history of who made the clothes and who wore them. On one wall, for example, an animated family tree traces the way the houses of Jeanne Hallée and Paquin trained two designers -- Madame Madeleine and Madeleine Lepeyre, who in turn gave birth to the house of Madeleine & Madeleine, which they led. It's a bit delicious to learn that Louise Nevelson, known for her monochromatic sculptures, donated the Bonnie Cashin mohair plaid ensemble and that Lauren Bacall had been the proud owner of the Sonia Rykiel powder pink skirt and striped sweater in the show (both designs never before exhibited).
Six "intergenerational" juxtapositions are shown back to back in the center of the main gallery, with a two-way mirror between each pair so the reflection of one shadows the other, like a ghost, hovering just behind: Prada's oily feathered coat against Schiaparelli's emerald metallic faille gown; Fortuny's pleated Delphos dress (the one that Mariano's wife and muse, Adele Henriette Elisabeth Nigrin Fortuny was instrumental in creating) against Ester Manas's ruched mesh (both made by a wife-and-husband team, both structured to conform to the body, rather than the other way around).
The totality creates an unexpectedly emotional experience while refusing to cater to reductionist generalities about "female" design (or who gets to wear the clothes; one of the mannequins is male, a reminder that the show may be gendered, but reality is not necessarily).
Indeed, Van Godtsenhoven pointed out, an underlying theme here is that the axiom that female designers create clothes for life while male designers create clothes for fantasy is as much a canard as the fetishization of the male designer as a sacred monster or an impossible artist.
After all, for every Kangaroo dress by Isabel Toledo that drapes gracefully over the maternal body, there is a silver sequined fairy tale of a halter-neck gown, like the one by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, that is so physically unforgiving it required a specially-ordered mannequin; for every minimalist trouser suit by Jil Sander, there is a lumps- and- bumps explosion of weirdness by Georgina Godley; for every 3-D printed futuristic bodysuit by Iris Van Herpen, there is an adaptable dress like the one Jasmin Soe designed for women with achondroplasia, which causes short stature, to adjust to their own taste.
In other words, the breadth of the exhibit makes a potent argument that the idea there are not enough women in fashion is misguided; that it is not really about a lack of female representation (or auteurship), but an institutional failure on all parts of the industry -- brands, schools, museums, media -- to recognize it, remember it and celebrate it.
"When we keep repeating the same names -- Dior, Balenciaga -- we create a canon and a history, and people start to drop off," said Van Godtsenhoven, the co-curator. And then, "all of a sudden, all we are talking about are 'masters' and 'fathers,"' rather than "mothers"
But really, the fashion world is replete with extraordinary women, if people would only look. That's on all of us.
As Claire McCardell once wrote, "Most of my designs seem startlingly self-evident. I wonder why I didn't think of them before." The same could be said of this show, as Huber pointed out. When asked why it took so long (and why it took two women to finally make it happen), she hedged diplomatically.
Whatever the reason, we should just be thankful the moment is finally here. After all, there are big jobs still to be filled at major European fashion brands, including Givenchy. Here's hoping their C.E.O.s take the time to stop in at the Met. They might leave with a different sense of the possible.

Hundreds of Films, and Two Critics Have to Pick: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Selecting the 10 best films of the year is always an exercise in decisiveness. This year, a strong slate made cutting the list a "small agony," one critic said.
The end of the year brings a deluge of "best of" lists at The New York Times, and few are quite as eagerly anticipated as the "best movies" roundup. (Bookworms may think otherwise.)
This year, Manohla Dargis, chief film critic, and Alissa Wilkinson, a Times film critic, offered their own lists of their 10 favorite films of 2023. Ms. Dargis first wrote a "best of" list for The Times in 2004; this year marks Ms. Wilkinson's first list (she joined The Times last month). The two worked independently and learned of each other's selections only after making their own.
Ms. Dargis's list spotlighted 10 films that coaxed people out of their homes and into theaters, including highly hyped flicks from blockbuster names (Christopher Nolan's "Oppenheimer") and quieter directorial debuts (A.V. Rockwell's "A Thousand and One"). The films Ms. Wilkinson selected all grappled with the concept of "ordinary evil." For example, Martin Scorsese's "Killers of the Flower Moon" forced viewers to confront the question: Is anyone really innocent?
As it happens, both critics anointed "Killers of the Flower Moon" as their No. 1 pick. Both say they are guided by instinct, not by a list of criteria, when evaluating films. And neither is concerned if her picks are contested in the comments section -- in fact, both said they liked to see a spirited dialogue.
In separate conversations, Ms. Dargis and Ms. Wilkinson explained their "best of" selection process. Read excerpts from both interviews, which have been edited and condensed, below.
Manohla Dargis on her Process
Manohla Dargis found cutting her list of favorite films down to 10 to be "a small agony," but knew it would help guide readers through the thicket of choices. One movie she could watch over and over again is "The Wizard of Oz."
You've been writing about films professionally since 1987 and have critiqued them for The Times for nearly 20 years. How has your approach changed?
It changes all the time. My starting point is always, What is interesting to me about this? Then I use that as the thread that I continue to pull; I see where it takes me. I don't have any sort of formula or template. Reviews are about trying to say something interesting about how a particular object works. That's how I see the job, really. The review has to be interesting to me, otherwise it won't be interesting to anyone else. Even with a dull movie, I ask, Well, why was this movie dull?
I fundamentally believe that reviews are a form of service journalism. I'm here to let you know, in one way or another, how I feel about a movie.
I try to avoid the kind of hype that occurs online, because that is usually generated by public relations. The best way to see a movie is to know absolutely nothing about it. Rarely do I get that opportunity. But it can be quite delightful.
You see hundreds of movies a year. How do you narrow down your favorite 10?
I scan a lot of lists. I look at The Times's Critics' Picks. I look at them to remember what I liked and to see what the other critics recommended. There is no way I can see every single movie that comes out in a year -- it's hundreds, if not thousands, of movies. My list is limited to those that were released in theaters, and I don't add anything that hasn't opened in the United States. I want these movies to have had a life out in the world.
Was there anything specifically noteworthy about putting together the list this year?
Most years, the 10 titles on my list can be rearranged differently depending on the day. It is somewhat unusual, then, that from the moment I started thinking about this list, I knew what was going to be No. 1.
Alissa Wilkinson's Times Debut
Alissa Wilkinson, a former film writer for Vox, was hired at The Times and immediately began work on her "best of" list. But she had been keeping a running inventory of films in her head all year long. One movie she could watch over and over again is "The Devil Wears Prada."
You're new to The Times and its readership. As a critic, you have to be aware of your audience, but independent of it. What does that look like?
I think this list was doubly important to me because in some ways, it served as my introduction to The Times's readership. It is very representative of how I think about film.
A lot of it comes down to the question of, What is a Top 10 list for? A lot of people see it as a list that's meant to validate their taste, or as a predictor of the Oscars. I don't think that's useful. For me, the best Top 10 lists are the ones where I don't agree with them at all, or I haven't even heard of most of what's on it, because it tells me the things that I haven't seen that I probably should. The more varied the lists are, the better. For critics, the thing that is most important when you're putting together a Top 10 list is giving your audience something to chew on.
Are you a gut feeling kind of person, or do you consult a list of criteria?
I have always operated on the assumption that everyone has a reaction to a film that's slightly different, and they're all valid. The fact that a film moves me, and that the person sitting next to me is left stone cold, doesn't mean there's something wrong with them or with me. But for a critic, the job is to start with the gut feeling and then try to nail down where that's coming from. I am making an argument for my reaction.
It's really important for critics not to go in with a list of things that they believe a movie ought to be judged by. Every movie has a thing that it is trying to be, and I'm asking, Do I think it's successful at its own aims? I'm often really proud of the reviews where people are like, I can't quite tell if you liked it.
I'm not here to tell you to like something. I'm here to tell you how I saw something and why I saw it that way, and help you process your own reaction.
A ranked list can feel reductive. But you're trying to keep things nuanced.
I compare being a critic to being a sommelier. I drink wine and I might like it. But my friend who's a sommelier can tell me why it works or doesn't. That's because he's had a billion more glasses of wine than I have and has thought about them. A critic is like a sommelier for film -- I'm going to have different perspectives because I've seen hundreds of movies. But importantly, that doesn't invalidate someone else's perspective. That's what art is for; that's what makes it fun.

Full text: Ann and Sid Mashburn, clothiers in Atlanta, have opened a store on Madison Avenue. Is it a business to be reckoned with?
Upstarts! That was this reporter's initial reaction on hearing that Mashburn, an arriviste from the hinterlands (Atlanta), had the effrontery to open a combined men's and women's clothing and accessories store on a busy corner of Madison Avenue just two blocks north of Ralph Lauren's Rhinelander Mansion flagship and directly across 74th Street from a mega-size Apple store.
Location, location! But what does this newcomer offer? What's behind the plate glass wraparound windows that practically reach the sidewalk, tempting passers-by to step inside and check out the goods?
The offerings are low-key, unpretentious; they don't scream excess. They're excellent examples of updated classics. The men's Ivy sport jackets and the women's shirtdresses are arguably among the biggest hits, especially at a time when "there's plenty of evidence that people are looking for stability in their lives and wardrobes," said G. Bruce Boyer, a men's fashion writer and journalist who is a Mashburn customer. "Think of the words most used in fashion now -- vintage, heritage, curated, sustainable -- and updated classic becomes the perfect choice for today."
Before Madison Avenue, Mashburn had already opened stores in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles (currently men's wear only) and Washington, D.C., each with "a proven track record," said Chip Ervin, the owner of Grady Ervin & Co., a shop in Charleston, S.C., which stocks the brand's men's wear. "The logical extension was New York."
And New York, said Sid Mashburn, who owns the business with his wife, Ann, "puts you on a different level. I dreamed of New York my entire life."
The stock-in-trade, which the two design as well as gather from other sources, is rife with carefully thought-out, quietly luxurious details (luminescent Trocas shell buttons, beautifully scaled pockets, flat-felled seams, pick-stitched corners), along with made-to-measure and tailoring services. It's all done in top-notch fabrics and put together with a measure of sass (as in the Fair Isle-esque wool socks, $ 35 to $ 45, and the faux fur bucket bags, $ 150).
The men's section has a clubby atmosphere, with a zebra-hide rug and a billiard table. The wares run the gamut: natural-shoulder, close-to-the-body men's suits, sport jackets (the biggest sellers), shoes, leather goods, watches -- one of which, endearingly enough, is the Timex Easy Reader ( $ 55), with a metal band that Mr. Mashburn suggests replacing, when needed, with a nylon NATO strap ( $ 15) -- the kind that was issued by the British Ministry of Defense in 1973.
The men's suits and jackets "are really closer to what Paul Stuart used to do than to Brooks Brothers," Mr. Boyer said, noting "the soft construction in the shoulder and chest but with some subtle waist shaping, more sophisticated than the traditional Ivy style of tailoring."
The Virgil sack suit jacket -- it got its name from Sidney Poitier's role as the homicide detective Virgil Tibbs in the 1967 film "In the Heat of the Night" -- is elegant but relaxed ( $ 1,350 to $ 1,950). The unlined, unconstructed Butcher jacket comes in a range of fabrics, including an easy-going, cardigan-like wool flannel ( $ 995).
Ms. Mashburn's section of the shop, with its gilt-edged glass jewelry case and toile-covered wall, runs its own gamut of goods: outerwear, dresses, separates, PJs, gloves lined with rabbit fur, mink headbands and faux fur phone cases. One standout item is a kimono-sleeve wool tartan coat ( $ 795), which Louise Paul, an accessories designer, called "versatile and funky" when she stopped by.
For this reporter, the most "signature" of the women's items are the shirtwaist dresses in cottons and silks ( $ 350 to $ 700). And as if channeling the late-midcentury era that such items evoke, Ms. Mashburn wears her hair in a French twist -- in evidence when she and-or Mr. Mashburn are in town to commandeer the shop every few weeks.
White cotton and silk shirts ( $ 195 to $ 425) go well with a slim black knit pull-on skirt ( $ 250) or a very 1950s Black Watch tartan skirt in bias-cut stretch wool ( $ 395) and the block-heel buckle shoes that are Ann Mashburn mainstays. Available in varying heel heights ( $ 295 to $ 350), they recall not so much Pilgrim footwear as the Roger Vivier pumps Catherine Deneuve wore in "Belle du Jour." (The pumps are perfect with the sheer nylons that are back in style or with socks of any length.)
The Mashburns, both of whom are 62, bring style pedigrees to their business. Growing up outside Jackson, Miss., Mr. Mashburn watched "a lot of TV," he said. "Get Smart," "I Spy," "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." Inspired by "the '60-style lean tailoring," he had his trousers tapered (by his mother) when he was a teen. Arriving in New York in 1984, he worked at Frank Stella, British Khaki and Robert Leighton before becoming J. Crew's first men's designer -- and that, despite zero formal training.
What's more, that was back in J. Crew's heyday. In 1991, he joined Ralph Lauren's Polo design team. Somewhere along the way, he began wearing colorful African neck beads, which he continues doing to this day. They're sold at the shop ( $ 20 and $ 25 per strand).
Ms. Mashburn, with an upbringing in Midwestern states, recalled being inspired by iconic pieces of clothing seen in movies: Ms. Deneuve's trench coat in "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg," Jean Seberg's striped Breton T-shirt in "Breathless." (Hmm ... all these '60s film references.) She, too, moved to New York in 1984, landing a job at Vogue as assistant to the fashion editor Polly Mellen.
"My side of the brand is informed by that," she said. "It was like going to Harvard for fashion -- and life, to be honest. The older women I met taught me about confidence and style and dressing for practicality without sacrificing a sense of imagination." Next came an editing job at Glamour, followed by styling work at J. Crew. The two met, independent of work, in 1985.
In 2007, by then married, they relocated to Atlanta. "We heard it was a great city, a complex city, with a fantastic food and music scene," Mr. Mashburn said. There, he quickly found a master tailor, Quang Dau, and opened a men's wear shop, taking what he described as "an open-kitchen approach," with the cutting and tailoring done in full view on the store floor.
In 2010, Ms. Mashburn opened her own shop. In 2012, she moved to a larger space that was connected with her husband's. In addition to the styles they design, they stock carefully chosen pieces from, for instance, Ulla Johnson and Aspesi, for women's wear; Filson, for its tote bags; Vintner's Daughter, for cosmetics; and Craighill, for objects for the home.
And while they were at it, the Mashburns raised five daughters, all of whom have contributed to the family business. Elizabeth Mashburn Suarez, the eldest, 33, "helped define the look-feel-voice of the brand from the outset, and we cooperate on all things creative," Ms. Mashburn said. "Working with my daughters is definitely less complicated than working with my husband!"
The Madison Avenue shop is welcoming and relaxed. A phonograph (yes, a phonograph) plays '60s and '70s rock and soul -- Fleetwood Mac's "Rumours," Al Green's "Greatest Hits," Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Skynyrd's Innyrds."
So you wonder: Is this store in some kind of post-midcentury time warp? What is its appeal to customers whose likeliest ZIP codes are adjacent to Central Park, just footsteps away.
"At first I was underwhelmed," Ms. Paul said. "The overall impression I had was utilitarian. But I got curious, tried on a few things and realized they make their understated statement using high-end fabrics, with subtle details and sometimes daring colors and prints. They have to be sought out. Do busy New Yorkers give them a chance? My guess is yes." The goods are, she said, solid investment pieces.
"Sometimes boutiques can seem intimidating," said Laura Cantral, an environmental protection and conservation consultant who is a customer at the Atlanta store. But the Mashburns, she said, "know how to strike the right balance, giving you space and assisting you with what you need. Warmth is their special sauce."
Contributing to the hospitality are the shop's staffers -- cheerfully unobtrusive aunt-and-uncle and cool niece-and-nephew types who happen to be styling whizzes. "The way we hire is the way it was done in 'Ocean's 11,"' Mr. Mashburn said, referring to that film's recruits for a Las Vegas casino heist. What's needed, he said, "are the Alan Arkin and the Bernie Mac and the Matt Damon. We like the mix."
Tony Brand, the men's department manager, has a past not in crime, but at Prada, Tom Ford, Ralph Lauren and Anderson & Sheppard, the bespoke tailors on Savile Row.
What does Mashburn's future hold? A Nashville store is in the works for 2024, and under discussion, Mr. Mashburn said, are more openings -- in Charlotte, N.C., and Chicago -- not to mention a possible outpost in Greenwich Village. On a small scale, the plan seems to be to make the Mashburn brand of classic goods and personal service available countrywide -- even in downtown New York.

The Allure of the Instagrammable Office: [None]

Full text: Inside the "blueberry muffin" conference room, the walls are, naturally, painted blue. Not just any blue -- it's the calming color you might find a baby's bedroom, what the paint can refers to as "sea to shining sea." Anchoring the room is a table, red and oblong, adorned with fake succulents in purple pots.
Nearby is the "fruity" conference room, with "razzle dazzle" red walls and vintage chairs upholstered in yellow pineapple printed cloth. Down the hallway is "maple waffle," the room where the company holds its more serious meetings with investors. There, the walls are a subdued shade of brown.
This is the office of the cereal brand Magic Spoon, which was introduced in 2019 and, starting last year, called its roughly 50 employees back to in-person work, at least two days a week. At Magic Spoon's SoHo space, which was designed right around the company's return-to-office push, the conference rooms are meant to feel like cereal boxes.
"One of our core company values is, 'Be a Froot Loop in a world of Cheerios,"' said Greg Sewitz, a Magic Spoon co-founder. "We wanted the office to underline that."
Their space also reflects what designers, executives and workers describe as a trend that's not entirely new, but is now becoming the go-to among certain start-ups, tech companies and other moneyed employers vying for young talent. It's what might be called the Envy Office -- what happens when companies try to combine the comforts of a living room and the glamour of a vacation. These spaces -- often characterized by colorful walls, upholstered furniture and carefully curated coffee table books -- lure workers in with plenty of opportunities to fill their social feeds with photos taken at the workplace.
"It's taking cues from home, from hospitality, from Pinterest," said Jordan Goldstein, a co-managing principal at Gensler, one of the world's largest architecture firms, where clients have lately been asking for greenery and soft seating. He cited, as an example, the new headquarters of Marriott, which Gensler redesigned to incorporate banquettes, library nooks and a tree growing through the middle of the lobby. Gensler has also recently redone offices for Barclays, Pinterest and LinkedIn in this style.
To some employees, though, all the fake plants, accent walls and stylish dog beds sometimes seem designed to mask the inconvenience of space-conserving arrangements like hot desks, where workers no longer have their own assigned work spaces.
Before the rise of remote work, the designers behind Magic Spoon's office, Laetitia Gorra, 41, and Sarah Needleman, 33, were the designers for the women's social club the Wing, a hallmark millennial-pink-drenched palace of throw pillows and color-coded bookshelves, which shut down last year. In 2020, Ms. Gorra founded the design firm Roarke, with Ms. Needleman running its operations. The duo helps executives figure out what an office should look like in a moment when many workers aren't convinced they need to go to one.
"Our pitch is very much about employee retention," Ms. Gorra said. "We came from working on our sofas in yoga pants -- what can we do to make your employees want to come back to the office?"
It's a cycle that American workers have seen before: When working norms change, the design of the office goes with them. In fact, in a survey of some 14,000 workers around the globe conducted by Gensler last year, nearly 40 percent said their employers redesigned their offices during the pandemic.
"If you're looking at the history of the office, you're looking at the history of changing attitudes toward what constitutes work, who workers should be," said Craig Robertson, a media historian and author of "The Filing Cabinet." "The design of an office is shaped by dominant social values."
As with each previous iteration of workplace aesthetics, including this latest trend, many managers are also trying to achieve a more straightforward goal: get people to spend time at the office.
Cubicle Farm to Open Table
Just over half a century ago, the shiniest new feature of office life was the cubicle.
In the years after World War II, America's white collar work force was swelling, buoyed by a booming economy and influx of women into the workplace. Management "scientists," like the efficiency-obsessed Frederick Winslow Taylor, had earlier pushed for companies to treat white-collar work more like factory work. Enter the Action Office: modular office furniture, which became cubes that packed people tightly together.
Cubicle farms, according to office historians like Nikil Saval, reminded people of their place in the power structure, with higher-ups typically allocated more space.
"You were surrounded by hundreds of people like you," said Sheila Liming, an associate professor at Champlain College and the author of the design history book "Office." "You get this idea that you're replicable."
It's hard to look at a cubicle farm and imagine it prompting the kind of out-of-the-box ideas that companies were craving in the tech world of the 1990s, after Bill Gates and Paul Allen had mythologized Microsoft's beginnings inside a garage. Tech start-ups wanted workers to break out of their sterile cubes and feel a sense of ownership over their work, a sense of infinite potential growth.
That was partially the notion that gave birth to a new phase of office design: the tech utopia. Carolyn Chen, a sociologist who spent years researching life at Bay Area tech companies, noted some of the physical elements that distinguished their campuses. There were free snacks (peanut-butter cups, potato chips, dried mango) and sometimes booze (beer, frosé). There were nap pods and massage chairs.
Ms. Chen saw one company spend part of its design budget on making the office look grungier. It paid money to expose its bricks and pipes, sending the message to workers that they should adopt a start-up mentality and work overtime.
And because the tech offices of the early 2000s were such social spaces -- with happy hours and video games -- the takeaway for some workers was that they didn't need to go home to find leisure or community.
"When you think about the way Google revolutionized the office, it was in the idea that there was a standing invitation for workers to not just do their jobs but spend their free time there as well," Ms. Liming said. "The word campus is really operative."
But if there's anything more appealing than a campus, it's working from bed. So when the pandemic arrived, and offices became literal homes as opposed to figurative ones, managers had to rethink what it meant to make the office an alluring destination.
'Live From HQ'
When Magic Spoon's team moved into the new office earlier this year, Sarah Bourlakas, 26, who was the senior social and community manager, snapped a photo to post on her personal Instagram story with the text: "Live from HQ."
That Instagrammability isn't accidental. Brooke Erin Duffy, an associate professor of communication at Cornell University, argues that employers are using social media aesthetics in the same way they're deploying traditional perks like cold brew, or less traditional ones like the Lizzo concert Google put on for its workers. It's all corporate image making. Companies now want their office design to be visible not just to employees, but also to everyone on social media, which Ms. Duffy said was about "retaining employees by hyping this fun, enjoyable, hyper-social workplace."
Hollywood and television used to be the primary sites that advertised to young people the glamour of office life, Ms. Duffy noted. There was "The Devil Wears Prada," "Mad Men," "The Internship," "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," "The Social Network."
Now social media is increasingly where people go to romanticize office life -- particularly on TikTok, where content creators like "Corporate Natalie" riff on the professional antics that many young people, starting their careers during the pandemic, have yet to experience. More than half of workers say they get a sense of identity from their jobs, according to consistent findings in Gallup polling from 1989 through 2014. It's no surprise, then, that young people would want to put on their social media profiles what's so central to their senses of self. And the more trendy an office is, the easier it feels for workers to convey that their careers are more thrilling than the cubicle doldrums chronicled in "Office Space."
When Ms. Bourlakas photographed Magic Spoon's new SoHo space, her Instagram followers seemed dazzled.
"So many people commented, like 'Oh my gosh, it's so sick,"' said Ms. Bourlakas, who recently left Magic Spoon for another job. "'It's so Magic Spoon coded."'
Dreaming of Cubicle Life
Touring some of these new Envy Offices, where workers hunch over long desks wearing noise-canceling headphones, there are gaps between what workers are getting and what they say want. They have wall decals and curated book collections. What they actually need, some say, is privacy.
A 10-minute walk away from Magic Spoon, the communications agency M&C Saatchi Sport & Entertainment has an office also redesigned by Roarke in 2021. Workers sit at long, communal wooden tables in front of exposed brick and surrounded by a jungle of artificial greenery. Atop a Keith Haring coffee table book sits a single bunch of faux grapes.
Maddy Franklin, 27, a senior art director there, said there were elements of the new office she loved, like its friendliness to dogs. But because of the hot-desk system, she has no place to store personal items.
It can also be tricky to get a spot with a monitor. When Ms. Franklin is working on a big project, to secure a highly coveted seat, "I will aim to get to the office a little earlier," she said.
Robin Clark, 58, who works as a marketing director at a health care nonprofit, longs for the days before her office transitioned to an open floor plan. When her company did a full redesign in 2018, executives tried to make the space inviting, creating lounge areas with couches in bright colors like orange, teal and lime. But the lack of barriers between desks means Ms. Clark's workday has an incessant, noisy backdrop: apples crunching, colleagues sneezing. When she started working from home, during the pandemic, she realized what she wanted was peace and quiet.
As she put it: "With cubicle walls you have at least the perception that you have some privacy."
In an ironic twist, other workers are now also finding themselves nostalgic for the age of the cubicle. Take Jerry Gulla, 56, a senior engineering manager, based in Winchester, Mass, who began his career in 1989 when cubicles were the norm. Over the years, as he worked in offices with open-floor plans and hot-desk systems, he missed being able to customize his desk -- himself, not with any help from a design firm.
Mr. Gulla is a fan of the TV show "The Expanse," and he used to have a model ship from the show in his work space. "Somebody might be walking by and see that you're a fan," he recalled. "So you kind of strike up a conversation and you meet somebody new that way."
To Mr. Gulla, the office ideal is simple: "It's just a place that's conducive to getting work done."

Tech startups wanted workers to break out of their sterile cubes and feel a sense of ownership over their work, a sense of infinite potential growth.
That was partly the notion that gave birth to a new phase of office design: the tech utopia. Carolyn Chen, a sociologist who spent years researching life at Bay Area tech companies, noted some of the physical elements that distinguished their campuses. There were free snacks (peanut butter cups, potato chips, dried mango) and sometimes booze (beer, frosé). There were nap pods and massage chairs.
Chen saw one company spend part of its design budget on making the office look grungier. It paid money to expose its bricks and pipes, sending the message to workers that they should adopt a startup mentality and work overtime.
And because the tech offices of the early 2000s were such social spaces — with happy hours and video games — the lesson for some workers was that they didn’t need to go home to find leisure or community.
“When you think about the way Google revolutionized the office, it was in the idea that there was a standing invitation for workers to not just do their jobs but spend their free time there as well,” Liming said. “The word ‘campus’ is really operative.”
But if there’s anything more appealing than a campus, it’s working from bed. So when the pandemic arrived, and offices became literal homes as opposed to figurative ones, managers had to rethink what it meant to make the office an alluring destination.
Social Media Aesthetics
When Magic Spoon’s team moved into the new office earlier this year, Sarah Bourlakas, 26, who was the senior social and community manager, snapped a photo to post on her personal Instagram story with the text “Live from HQ.”
That Instagrammability isn’t accidental. Brooke Erin Duffy, an associate professor of communication at Cornell University, argues that employers are using social media aesthetics in the same way they’re deploying traditional perks like cold brew, or less traditional ones like the Lizzo concert Google put on for its workers. It’s all corporate image making. Companies now want their office design to be visible not just to employees but also to everyone on social media, which Duffy said was about “retaining employees by hyping this fun, enjoyable, hypersocial workplace.”
Hollywood and television used to be the primary sites that advertised to young people the glamour of office life, Duffy noted. There was “The Devil Wears Prada,” “Mad Men,” “The Internship,” “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” and “The Social Network.”
Now social media is increasingly where people go to romanticize office life — particularly on TikTok, where content creators like “Corporate Natalie” riff on the professional antics that many young people, starting their careers during the pandemic, have yet to experience. More than half of workers said they got a sense of identity from their jobs, according to consistent findings in Gallup polling from 1989 through 2014. It’s no surprise, then, that young people would want to put on their social media profiles what’s so central to their sense of self. And the more trendy an office is, the easier it feels for workers to convey that their careers are more thrilling than the cubicle doldrums chronicled in “Office Space.”
When Bourlakas photographed Magic Spoon’s new SoHo space, her Instagram followers seemed dazzled.
“So many people commented, like ‘Oh, my gosh, it’s so sick,’” said Bourlakas, who recently left Magic Spoon for another job. “‘It’s so Magic Spoon-coded.’”
Touring some of these new Envy Offices, where workers hunch over long desks wearing noise-canceling headphones, there are gaps between what workers are getting and what they say they want. They have wall decals and curated book collections. What they actually need, some say, is privacy.
Crunching and Sneezing
A 10-minute walk away from Magic Spoon, the communications agency M&C Saatchi Sport & Entertainment has an office also redesigned by Roarke in 2021. Workers sit at long, communal wooden tables in front of exposed brick and surrounded by a jungle of artificial greenery. Atop a Keith Haring coffee table book sits a single bunch of faux grapes.
Maddy Franklin, 27, a senior art director there, said there were elements of the new office she loved, like its friendliness to dogs. But because of the hot-desk system, she has no place to store personal items.
It can also be tricky to get a spot with a monitor. When Franklin is working on a big project, to secure a highly coveted seat, “I will aim to get to the office a little earlier,” she said.
Robin Clark, 58, who works as a marketing director at a health care nonprofit, longs for the days before her office transitioned to an open floor plan. When her company did a full redesign in 2018, executives tried to make the space inviting, creating lounge areas with couches in bright colors like orange, teal and lime. But the lack of barriers between desks means Clark’s workday has an incessant, noisy backdrop: apples crunching, colleagues sneezing. When she started working from home during the pandemic, she realized what she wanted was peace and quiet.
As she put it, “With cubicle walls, you have at least the perception that you have some privacy.”
Other workers are also finding themselves nostalgic for the age of the cubicle. Take Jerry Gulla, 56, a senior engineering manager, based in Winchester, Massachusetts, who began his career in 1989 when cubicles were the norm. Over the years, as he worked in offices with open floor plans and hot-desk systems, he missed being able to customize his desk — himself, not with any help from a design firm.
Gulla is a fan of the science-fiction TV series “The Expanse,” and he used to have a model ship from the show in his workspace. “Somebody might be walking by and see that you’re a fan,” he recalled. “So you kind of strike up a conversation, and you meet somebody new that way.”
To Gulla, the office ideal is simple: “It’s just a place that’s conducive to getting work done.”

Full text: A show about the televangelist, with songs by Elton John and Jake Shears, had a run in London last year and plans to open in New York next season.
A new musical about Tammy Faye Bakker, the singing televangelist whose colorful life and collapsed ministry have repeatedly been dramatized for stage and screen, is pledging to open on Broadway next season.
The show, called "Tammy Faye," features music by Elton John and lyrics by Jake Shears of the Scissor Sisters. The musical had a run last year at the Almeida Theater in London, where the critic Matt Wolf called it "spectacularly entertaining."
The musical is being directed by Rupert Goold, the artistic director of the Almeida and a two-time Tony nominee for the plays "Ink" and "King Charles III." The book is by James Graham, a prolific English playwright whose previous Broadway outings include "Ink" and the musical "Finding Neverland."
John and Shears, although best known for their careers in pop music, have both worked extensively in theater. John has written songs for many shows, including "The Lion King"; won a Tony Award for "Aida"; and is now also reworking a musical adaptation of "The Devil Wears Prada" that was poorly received during an initial production in Chicago. Shears has not only written theater songs, but also performed in "Kinky Boots" on Broadway, and is currently starring in "Cabaret" in London.
"Tammy Faye" explores the life and work of Bakker (she used the surname Messner in her final years), who had an enormously successful, and lucrative, television ministry in the 1970s and 1980s, that fell apart when her husband and partner in ministry, Jim Bakker, was indicted and then imprisoned for fraud.
She was known for her big hair, her big personality and her big heart -- her compassion for people with AIDS made her a popular figure among gay people often shunned by evangelicals. The musical explores her life in the context of the rise of a politically potent religious right in the United States.
Bakker's arc has proved irresistible to storytellers. Jessica Chastain won an Academy Award playing her in the 2021 film "The Eyes of Tammy Faye," and there have been several other stage projects.
"Tammy Faye" is being produced by Rocket Stage, which is a theater production company established by John and his husband, David Furnish; Greene Light Stage, which is a production company established by Sally Greene, who has a business partnership with John; and James L. Nederlander, who is the president and chief executive of the Nederlander Organization.
The producers said Friday that the musical would open at one of the nine Nederlander Broadway houses in the 2024-25 theater season; they did not specify which theater, and did not announce any casting.
Andrew Rannells, who played Jim Bakker in London, and who is now starring in "Gutenberg! The Musical!" on Broadway, recently told Andy Cohen he was expecting the show to arrive on Broadway soon, but did not say whether he was continuing with the project.

Full text: In an era of expediency, gastropods are oozing into fashion and design -- and reminding us that we, too, can take our time.
In September, at Prada's spring 2024 women's show, models walked between translucent curtains of pink slime that dripped from the ceiling and pooled on the floor. The brand referred to them as "fluid interruptions," a concept that was echoed in the collection's flowing organza dresses and fringed skirts. Above all, though, it evoked the secretions of a snail, an animal that has recently been crawling into the realms of design and fashion.
In an accelerated age, it makes sense that we'd revere a creature that moves through the world slowly and deliberately. "The snail reminds me that it's fine to take time," says the Bangkok-based artist and creative director Eric Tobua, 40, who's made the gastropod a recurring motif in his work for fashion clients, sometimes incorporating his own albino giant African land snail, Lolita, into photo shoots. In 2019, he released a wearable snail-shaped art piece made from recycled plastic bottles and bags. Two years ago, the jewelry designer Brent Neale Winston, 43, created a gold signet ring adorned with a snail and the words "Keep Trucking," informed by a Grateful Dead song. Snail pendants followed, their shells sprinkled with diamonds or sapphires.
At least 1,100 species of land snails are known to be endangered, so it's only natural that the fashion companies celebrating snails in their designs are usually those that limit waste or rely upon recycled materials: The British label Story Mfg. sells crocheted, snail-encircled hats made with organic cotton yarn and plant-based dyes. Online Ceramics, the company known for its small runs of psychedelic T-shirts, collaborated with the North Face to produce a recycled nylon rain jacket printed with a smiling snail.
Slugs -- snails whose shells have been internalized or lost over the course of their evolution -- are similarly oozing into creative circles: The New York-based ceramist Marc Armitano Domingo, 27, makes gold-rimmed porcelain plates with three-dimensional versions trailing iridescent lines of slime. For her solo show at New York's Deli gallery in September, the London artist Anousha Payne, 32, arranged maroon ceramic mollusks in a spiral on one wall.
Today's interest in snails has long precedent in art. Doodles of knights jousting with the creatures are common in the margins of medieval books. Salvador Dalí sculpted them; Joan Miró painted them; Henri Matisse collaged them. But the recent fascination dates to the pandemic, when some city dwellers who weren't ready to commit to dogs decided to instead adopt snails -- who, like the rest of us, were trapped inside their own homes. In 2020, the artist duo Aleia Murawski, 34, and Sam Copeland, 37, released a book, "Snail World: Life in the Slimelight," showing their "cast of eight adult snails" in an array of everyday and fantastical settings. Recently, their pets have starred in ads for Burberry (waiting for the subway with a tiny pink handbag) and DoorDash (picking up a food delivery).
But the patron saint of snail-loving artists is from a few decades ago. The writer Patricia Highsmith reportedly nurtured 300 gastropods in her English garden. In 1947, she published a short story, "The Snail-Watcher," about a financial broker who becomes entranced with them, which in turn inspires a "new zest for life" that improves his performance at work. Spoiler alert: It ends badly. Still, as Highsmith once said of the creatures themselves, "They give me a sort of tranquillity."

A $75 Million Sale at 220 Central Park South Is One of the Year's Biggest: [Real Estate Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The full-floor apartment was sold to a buyer who already owns a condo in the building. Another property went for $ 66 million, and still others for $ 50 million or more.
A flurry of big sales closed in New York City during October, including one of the year's priciest, a full-floor aerie at 220 Central Park South purchased in a private deal for $ 75 million.
The sellers, David Littman, who runs a lighting business, and his wife, Constance Littman, earned a huge profit in the transaction, having paid $ 55.5 million for the brand-new, 45th-floor unit just four years ago. The buyer was anonymous.
Other mega sales took place along nearby Billionaires' Row. A 79th-floor apartment at 432 Park Avenue sold for $ 65.6 million; a new penthouse at Steinway Tower, at 111 West 57th Street, for just under $ 53 million; and a high-floor sponsor unit at 217 West 57th Street, a.k.a. Central Park Tower, for $ 46.2 million.
On the Upper East Side, at 768 Fifth Avenue, better known as the Plaza Condominium and Residences, an apartment sold for $ 65.8 million. The mansion once owned by the banker David Rockefeller, at 144-146 East 65th Street, sold for $ 47 million. And a few blocks away, the townhouse used in the film "The Devil Wears Prada," as the home of Meryl Streep's imperious character Miranda Priestly, sold for $ 26.5 million.
Also in October, the media executive Perry A. Sook and his wife, Sandy Sook, a retired teacher, bought a duplex penthouse on Central Park West. And two notable Park Avenue co-op duplexes closed -- one sold by Marc E. Kasowitz, a trial lawyer who had represented former President Donald J. Trump, the other by the estate of Jeffrey Paley, the son of William S. Paley, the founder of CBS.
The $ 75 million sale of the 45th floor at 220 Central Park South is the city's second-biggest in 2023 (so far), surpassed only by another purchase in the limestone complex: a duplex in the villa portion that sold for $ 80 million in August.
But the buyer in the more recent deal, using the limited liability company 220 CPS Parkview, actually spent more in total. The entity also acquired a two-bedroom, two-bathroom unit on the 19th floor in May for $ 5 million.
Elizabeth Sahlman of Compass represented the sellers in both of those closings.
Mr. Litton is the founder and chief executive of the Hudson Valley Lighting Group, a purveyor of high-end home lighting products based in Wappingers Falls, N.Y.
The 45th-floor apartment encompasses 6,591 square feet and includes five bedrooms, six full bathrooms and two powder rooms, along with two 48-square-foot balconies that provide panoramic park views.
The 70-story Central Park South skyscraper, near Columbus Circle, remains the city's most expensive residential building, and arguably the world's most profitable. It is home to the nation's highest-priced single residence: four full floors that were bought by the hedge fund manager Kenneth C. Griffin in early 2019 for nearly $ 240 million.
And while some Manhattan luxury buildings have seen resales going for less than the original sale price, or at modest increases, 220 Central Park South apartments have more than held their value -- the 45th-floor unit sold for 35 percent more than the original sale price -- in large part because of the skyscraper's desirable proximity to the park.
On Billionaires' Row, the apartment at 432 Park Avenue sold for around 11 percent more than what the anonymous seller had paid to the building's sponsor in 2016 -- $ 65.6 million vs. $ 59.1 million.
Still, this was a lot less than the $ 135 million initially sought when it was re-listed in 2021; the price was lowered to $ 92 million this past summer. Also, it's not known how much money the seller had to put into the apartment, having bought it as a "white box," according to the listing, devoid of interior walls or finishes.
Measuring 8,055 square feet, it now has seven bedrooms, eight full bathrooms and two powder rooms, plus a home office, den and a tearoom designed by the Japanese architect Hiroshi Sugimoto. Its best feature, though, may be the spectacular cityscape and park views it gets from the 79th floor of the 96-story building, between East 56th and 57th Streets.
The new owner used the limited liability company, August 79.
At 111 West 57th Street, at the Avenue of the Americas, the penthouse that closed at just under $ 53 million was also discounted. It had been listed for $ 58 million. The 7,175-square-foot apartment has three bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms. The buyer was Worldstar West L.L.C.
The 118th floor of 217 West 57th Street, which sold for $ 46.2 million, has 7,074 square feet, with five bedrooms and five and a half bathrooms. Its anonymous buyer used the limited liability company Sunshine MF II.
Armadillo Re, L.L.C. was listed as the buyer of the Plaza Condominium & Residence apartment, unit 1109, that closed at $ 65.8 million, giving the seller, which used the limited liability company Kayhil Holdings, a nice profit. The entity purchased it in 2008 for $ 45.9 million. The deal appears to have been done privately so there is little information available about the place.
The priciest townhouse, at $ 47 million, was the former Rockefeller mansion on East 65th Street, a red brick Colonial Revival with limestone details, standing four stories high and 40 feet wide.
Mr. Rockefeller, a grandson of the oil magnate John D. Rockefeller, had raised his family in the house and lived there until his death in 2017. His estate sold the property in 2018 for $ 20 million, reportedly to Doug Band, an adviser to former President Bill Clinton, and his wife, Lily Rafi, a handbag designer. The new owner used the limited liability company 144 East 65 in the transaction.
Built in 1924 between Lexington and Third Avenues, the mansion was part of the Upper East Side Historic District extension. The house encompasses roughly 9,777 square feet of interior space that includes eight bedrooms, eight full baths and three half baths, in addition to six smaller staff bedrooms.
Another pricey townhouse sale, at $ 26.5 million, took place at 129 East 73rd Street, between Lexington and Park Avenues in the Lenox Hill neighborhood. Movie buffs will know the 1907 neo-Italian Renaissance building as the stylish home of Ms. Priestly, the editor in chief of the fictional fashion magazine Runway in "The Devil Wears Prada."
The real owners were Craig Effron, a founding partner of the Scoggin Capital Management hedge fund, and his wife, Caryn Effron, an angel investor. The two had bought the house in 2003 for $ 8.8 million, then had a full renovation a couple of years later. They placed it back on the market last spring for $ 27.5 million.
The buyer was the 129 East 73rd Street Corporation.
The limestone and marble structure -- 22 feet wide and six stories high -- has 12,000 square feet of interior space, which features seven bedrooms, seven bathrooms, two powder rooms, a home gym and a library. There are also six fireplaces, and tons of outdoor space, including a rear garden off the main kitchen (not to be confused with the service kitchen), terraces off two bedrooms and the dining room.
At the top floor, used for storage, is a terrace with a hot tub and a custom basketball court.
Among the duplex deals, the Sooks paid almost $ 15.1 million for their penthouse at 360 Central Park West, a 16-story, neo-Renaissance building designed by the architect Rosario Candela in the late 1920s.
Their new apartment has 4,354 square feet of interior space, plus a 1,065-square-foot wraparound terrace off the main entertaining space at the top level -- a great spot to see the fall foliage in the park. On the lower level are four bedrooms, as well as a media room with a wet bar and a den. The home also has three and a half bathrooms.
Mr. Sook is the chairman and chief executive of the Nexstar Media Group, which owns TV stations around the country.
At 1160 Park Avenue, at East 92nd Street, Mr. Kasowitz got $ 8 million for his six-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bathroom duplex. He sold it through a trust; the buyer was Robin Swid, an actress. Mr. Kasowitz, a longtime lawyer for Mr. Trump, had represented him during the federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections.
And the estate of Jeffrey Paley, who died in 2021 at age 82 of complications from the coronavirus, sold his duplex at 812 Park Avenue and East 75th Street for $ 9 million. The building, another late-1920s classic, was designed by the architect J. E.R. Carpenter. The apartment has four bedrooms, each with an en suite bathroom, a library and two powder rooms.
Mr. Paley's wide-ranging career included work as a columnist in Paris, an art gallery owner in SoHo and a private investor. The buyers were listed as Eli A. Kraicer, an investment analyst, and Jordana P. Fribourg, a philanthropist.

Full text: I thought pantyhose were dead, but now it seems as if they are being treated as the equivalent of actual pants. Are we supposed to believe the pantyhose-instead-of-pants look I see on social media is going to be a trend? And I thought leggings were bad.
Susan, Vancouver, B.C. It's true: Pantyhose (one of the most unappealing names for a garment ever invented) have been on the rise for a few seasons now, after disappearing almost entirely from many wardrobes as women not in the British royal family were freed from some of the more egregious dress code strictures of the past century.
Invented in 1959 by Allen Gant Sr., who called them "panti-legs," pantyhose may have revolutionized foundation garments by doing away with the girdle, garter belt and stockings, but by the millennium, being able to say no to pulling on a pair of flesh-sucking sheer tights was a sign of liberation. The fashion world became so attached to the End of Pantyhose that editors famously went to shows in February with bare legs and high heels, snow be damned.
Then, in September 2022, Matthieu Blazy of Bottega Veneta sent a navy crew neck down his runway paired with only dark hose and heels. A few months later, Miuccia Prada largely tossed pants and skirts out the window in her Miu Miu show, subversively matching her librarian cardigans and beatnik polo necks with sheer hose. A vibe was born. Or reborn.
Of course, Mrs. Prada did not invent the no-pants look -- that was popularized by Edie Sedgwick back when she was Andy Warhol's It girl, prancing around the Factory in black tights and a boat-neck tee. That may have been the reference when Emma Corrin (an It person of the moment) closed the Miu Miu fall show in a camel turtleneck, gold sparkly bikini bottoms and sheer brown hose.
Little wonder that earlier this month the audience at the spring 2024 Miu Miu show was chockablock with pants-less influencers, all vying for the title of It girl. Or that the style has been picked up by such figures as Kendall Jenner, who modeled the Bottega look in real life, and Rihanna, who went pantsless at ASAP Rocky's birthday dinner, wearing a ruffled chiffon top, bomber jacket and glossy tights.
Most people who live in the real world will never forgo their pants in favor of tights. But given that extreme runway fashion has a way of trickling down and becoming digestible for everyday, and given the talent Miuccia Prada has for making today what everyone wears tomorrow, odds are that the no-pants-but-pantyhose look may lead to a pantyhose renaissance.
Indeed, during the last round of fall 2023 shows, Virginie Viard was pairing white lace tights with almost every look on her Chanel runway. And Boss, Dolce & Gabbana, LaQuan Smith and Saint Laurent all featured sheer black pantyhose with pencil skirts and cocktail frocks.
All of which is good news for those who appreciate the smoothing, buffing effect that sheer pantyhose has on legs, not to mention the bit of added warmth when the temperature falls. Personally, I think they would be more popular if someone came up with a better name.

Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, Influencer: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane crashed on July 16, 1999, killing both Mr. Kennedy and his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy (as well as Carolyn's older sister), at the peak of their glamour and celebrity, the couple became not just another tragic story, but a symbol.
Think pieces proliferated about what it all meant: about the Kennedy curse and promises unfulfilled; about another chapter in, as The New York Times wrote in an editorial, the story of "unfinished journeys, of magnetic personalities cut down far too early."
He founded George magazine; she had been a publicist at Calvin Klein. Together they embodied not only the next golden generation of a sprawling, mythic family, but also the apotheosis of the collision between fashion, pop culture, magazines and politics that defined New York in 1990s. Seemingly it was the last gasp of the monoculture, when discretion in both dress and demeanor was its own kind of currency and everyone agreed on who did it best.
Little wonder that as fascination with that era reaches a new pitch, Ms. Bessette Kennedy has emerged as the ghost influencer of the season -- one who has particular resonance as stealth wealth evolves into an embrace of more functional minimalism in the face of global chaos; disillusionment grows with the cesspool that the digital world has become; and the question of what exactly it means to be "American" takes center stage.
"She used fashion as her way of having a conversation or dealing with the public," said Sunita Kumar Nair, the author of "CBK: Carolyn Bessette Kennedy: A Life in Fashion," to be published next month. The book focuses entirely on Ms. Bessette Kennedy's style as seen through essays and interviews with designers, photographers and fashion figures. And now, when it comes to that conversation, fashion is talking back. Perhaps more than ever.
This fall, the brand Sporty & Rich published an ad campaign recreating some of the most famous paparazzi shots of Carolyn and John: walking their dog or his bike in the streets of TriBeCa in crew necks and boots, clutching hands and newspapers in jeans and flip-flops. On runways throughout New York Fashion Week and beyond, the building blocks of the C.B.K. wardrobe -- white shirts, pencil skirts, jeans, loafers and pumps, slip dresses, men's overcoats -- dominated. The pieces were often referred to as "timeless" or "classic" or "understated," but with just enough rigor to seem interesting.
Though anniversaries often inspire a reassessment of historic figures (next year will be the 25th anniversary of the plane crash), and despite the Kennedy family finding itself once again in the news (Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is seeking the White House, and a coming Ryan Murphy show will include a portrayal of Lee Radziwill, Jackie Kennedy's younger sister), the C.B.K. revival is at once broader and more nuanced than that.
The Ubiquitous White Shirt and the 1990s
Like Diana, Princess of Wales, whose royal status, beauty and untimely death made her into a legend, Ms. Bessette Kennedy exists less as a person than an idea. Because she was so notoriously private, because she married into a family that had already colonized part of the public imagination, and because our memories of her are essentially preserved in amber (which is to say, a finite number of photographs, most of them taken between 1994, when she started dating Mr. Kennedy, and 1999), she will never age, get Botox, post an unthinking comment, get messy -- or change her style.
Instead, Ms. Bessette Kennedy offered an example of a different way to be in the world, one that valorized what wasn't shown. And because she never gave a single interview after her marriage, what she wore has become a stand-in for who she was.
That ethos has propelled her onto the mood boards of such disparate labels as Carolina Herrera and Sandy Liang; hovered in the air above the slip dresses and shirtdresses at Staud; and helped make the white button-up shirt the single most ubiquitous item of the season.
There were white artists' shirts at Altuzarra, worn over full midi-skirts; crisp white shirts at Bally, paired with neat white pencil skirts; and asymmetric white shirts at Dior. There were long white shirts-cum-dresses at Peter Do, white shirts buttoned to the neck at Loewe and white shirts paired with the sort of boyfriend jeans Ms. Bessette Kennedy favored at Stella McCartney. That's before you even get to the camel pencil skirts, another Bessette Kennedy staple, at Michael Kors, Gucci, MaxMara and Saint Laurent, to name a few.
"The woman this season is much quieter, less bold, with less nudity and fewer cutouts and leather 'powerful' looks," said Alexandra Van Houtte, the founder of the fashion search engine Tagwalk. "She's more discreet, also wears more wearable clothes, and colors on a whole have been a little bland: black, white, light blue" -- which pretty much sums up the Bessette Kennedy palette, with the addition of gray.
Indeed, across more than 11,000 images from the last round of shows in Paris, London, Milan and New York, Tagwalk found a 45 percent increase in the number of shirts compared with spring 2023, and an 8 percent increase in white, Ms. Van Houtte said. "Minimalism" was up 46 percent, and the 1990s was the single most searched tag. (In the TikTok style channel, videos related to the 1990s have more than 93 million views.)
If Kate Moss represented the grunge side of the '90s, Ms. Bessette Kennedy was its understated chic.
It was an aesthetic that married strong Social Register vibes (she wore headbands and even the occasional kerchief) with an appreciation for cut and material and a certain insouciance that never looked as if she was trying too hard.
"The Kennedys developed a style you could call casual but purposeful," said John Hellmann, a professor of English at Ohio State University and the author of "The Kennedy Obsession: The American Myth of JFK." "It seemed uniquely American but also modern in the best sense of the word. There was an economy to how they dressed. And Carolyn was in many ways the most updated version of that."
At a time when New York fashion is undergoing one of its periodic paradigm shifts, with the big brands that once defined a national aesthetic giving way to a melting pot of new names with diverse identities and reference points, she represents a certain touchstone in the ontology of American style.
Mystery, Minimalism, Sustainability
"She was minimalism with character -- she wasn't sterile or boring," said Wes Gordon, the creative director of Carolina Herrera, who, like many of the designers now channeling Ms. Bessette Kennedy's style, knew her only through the imagery. He thinks of her, he said, when he is removing an extraneous ruffle from a shirt or otherwise toning down the label's usual flamboyance. "I think I've seen every picture that exists of C.B.K.," he said.
It's this limited record that is part of her appeal, said Elizabeth Beller, whose book "Once Upon a Time: The Captivating Life of Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy," a more formal biography, will join the Bessette Kennedy chorus when it is published next spring. "In the age of social media, where lives are often curated for show, Carolyn's reserve is especially appealing."
Professor Hellmann agreed. "In an age of extreme image replication and proliferation, there's a mystery to John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette Kennedy that gives them dignity," he said.
She and Mr. Kennedy were one of the first celebrity couples to marry in total privacy in the age of tabloids and paparazzi, releasing only one picture they approved to the breathless public, who could not get enough of the simple silk slip dress Ms. Bessette Kennedy wore at her wedding -- designed by the then-unknown Narciso Rodriguez, a friend from her Calvin Klein days, who did not remain unknown for long.
"She would never have been on the Vogue.com wedding website," Ms. Liang said. "There's something very special about that. The archive is the archive."
Ms. Beller added that Ms. Bessette Kennedy "resonates with the cultural vibe of 'stealth wealth' and interest in sustainability."
She might have worn Yohji Yamamoto or Prada, but, Ms. Nair said, "she only had, like, 30 to 40 pieces in her wardrobe" -- unusual at a time when public figures are rarely seen in the same thing twice.
"You just think, 'Oh, OK, that's quite an edit right there,"' Ms. Nair said. "One of her friends said, 'You'd open up her wardrobe, and there's like, five black pants, a selection of really well-fitted shirts.' The rest sometimes she would borrow if she needed to go to gala events." She had a consistency that made her clothes feel as if they were "part of her psyche," Ms. Nair said. As if she had chosen them, not a stylist.
Put another way: She had an Hermès Birkin, but it looked used, chock-full of the stuff of everyday life; she even toted it on the subway. That makes Ms. Bessette Kennedy an object of fascination not simply because of what she wore, but because of how she handled what she wore.
"I'm always wondering, 'Would she wear this?"' Ms. Liang said. "Or what would she wear this with?"

Louis Vuitton Returns to Sailing: [Style Desk]

Full text: The luxury brand will sponsor the prestigious America's Cup yacht race in 2024 -- the same year it sponsors the Olympics.
Louis Vuitton's takeover of the sporting world continues apace: Next August, shortly after the LVMH-sponsored Summer Olympic Games end in Paris, the Louis Vuitton-sponsored America's Cup will begin in Barcelona.
America's Cup, the world's most prestigious sailing yacht competition, was last sponsored by Louis Vuitton in 2017. Since 1983, the fashion brand had also sponsored the Louis Vuitton Cup, a competition that determines who competes in America's Cup. (There are only two racing teams in America's Cup: the defending champions and the challenger who wins the Louis Vuitton Cup.)
After 2017, though, the Italian fashion house Prada became the race's main sponsor -- and the Louis Vuitton Cup became the Prada Cup.
Louis Vuitton did not comment on why it made the decision to come back or, seven years ago, to leave the competitive sailing world. In a news release, Pietro Beccari, the chairman and chief executive of the company, referred only to an "immense sense of pride" in returning to the competition as title partner.
Grant Dalton, the chief executive of America's Cup, pointed to the endurance of each organization: The America's Cup began in 1851; Louis Vuitton was founded in 1854. "It just feels completely natural that they're back in the game," he said.
Mr. Dalton hopes that reuniting with Louis Vuitton will bring more recognition to the niche sport, particularly among younger consumers. "They instantly make it easier for us to attract more sponsors," said Mr. Dalton, who referred to the alliance as a "very, very easy marriage." The Barcelona contest will take place between August and October in 2024.
For Louis Vuitton, the partnership is part of a much wider initiative in the world of sports. In recent years the company has created trunks to enclose the trophies of several major sporting events, including the World Cup, the NBA Finals, the Formula 1 Grand Prix de Monaco and the Rugby World Cup. As part of its sponsorship of the America's Cup and Louis Vuitton Cup, it will provide trophy trunks, too.
In July, the parent company LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton announced its sponsorship deal with the 2024 Paris Olympics and Paralympics, which will support a number of individual athletes, including the French swimmer Léon Marchand, the gymnast Mélanie de Jesus dos Santos and the fencer Enzo Lefort.
"The partnership will help promote France throughout the world," Bernard Arnault, the head of the conglomerate, said.
But the group's affinity for sports stretches far beyond France. Louis Vuitton's star ambassadors include Carlos Alcaraz, the Spanish tennis player who modeled in a men's formal wear campaign for Louis Vuitton in August, and Eileen Gu, a Chinese American skier who walked in the brand's 2023 cruise runway show.
Mr. Dalton, a New Zealand sailor who will be overseeing the competition in Barcelona -- the Emirates Team New Zealand team is the reigning America's Cup champion -- said that "the cup is the top of the food chain in our sport. And Louis Vuitton is on top of the fashion industry in the same way. There's no doubt about that."

The Artist's Way: [TGreats]

Full text: Whenever I read the profiles for this, our annual Greats issue, I'm always struck by the same thing: how many of our subjects say that their path once felt unclear to them. To us, they're people who changed not only their artistic genres but the culture at large. And to be sure, some of them, such as Queen Latifah, knew from an early age that they were meant to explode their medium, that they were destined to create transformative work. The world would notice them -- it was only a matter of time.
But I'd say that that conviction is the exception, not the rule. When you look at our Greats honorees over the years, you see that the path for many of them was meandering, the journey fitful. Some, like the artist Henry Taylor, who for years painted in obscurity while working as a nurse in a psychiatric hospital, found creative or critical success later in life; others, like the fashion designer Miuccia Prada, had to grapple with the gap between her political convictions and commercial and artistic talents (Prada has considered herself a socialist since university). Then there's Annette Bening, whose long, diverse, unpredictable career feels the result not of long-term strategy but of everyday curiosity, the kind that, if you're lucky, takes you to unexpected places.
Those of us trying to live artistic lives of our own can find plenty of inspiration in those of this year's honorees: especially about defiance, which all artists find themselves becoming expert in. It takes a special kind of self-possession to make something new, or to rebel against what you've been taught to want to create. And there are further lessons, too: in Queen Latifah's composure, in Taylor's determination, in Bening's instincts, in Prada's ambivalence. But most of all, we can take comfort in their reminders that art is rarely effortless, at any age or any stage in one's career, and that a life in the arts is always riven with doubt, no matter how it looks on the outside. Not everyone can make something that changes how we see the world. But everyone begins with something humble. -- HANYA YANAGIHARA (PHOTOGRAPH BY ANDREW KUO) This article appeared in print on page M252.

Full text: The designer reimagined fashion's relationship to art -- and forever transformed what the world considers beautiful.
EVEN BEFORE HEADING from the Fondazione Prada, a contemporary art complex housed in an old distillery on the southeastern edge of Milan, to Miuccia Prada's office about a mile away, I'm reminded of her towering presence everywhere I look. A docent, dressed in a black Prada uniform, shepherds a pair of tourists, both carrying Prada handbags, into a screening of "Four Unloved Women, Adrift on a Purposeless Sea, Experience the Ecstasy of Dissection," a short film by the Canadian director David Cronenberg accompanied by a wunderkammer of 18th-century anatomical wax sculptures. Once outside, I pass an abandoned rail yard and billboards for two other Fondazione exhibitions: a permanent re-creation of the home studio in Switzerland where Jean-Luc Godard edited his final movie, and a survey of videos, photographs and other works by the New York-based artist Dara Birnbaum on view at the Osservatorio, a satellite venue overlooking Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, the shopping arcade where Mario Prada, Miuccia's maternal grandfather, opened the brand's first store in 1913. Down another few blocks, an old woman in a pair of Prada sunglasses walks by with her dog.
At 75, Mrs. Prada, as she's known to strangers and friends alike, is perhaps the most peculiar and certainly the most innovative fashion designer of her generation. In 1975, she took over her family's leather goods business. Two years later, she met her future husband, Patrizio Bertelli, now 77 and the chairman of the Prada Group, with whom she began building a global empire. (In 2022, the company's annual revenue was $ 4.5 billion.) In addition to Prada, the couple has ownership stakes in Miu Miu, which might be described as Prada's unruly niece; the footwear brands Church's and Car Shoe; and the Pasticceria Marchesi pastry shops. (As of last year, they can also claim some of those dusty train tracks: Prada Holding, which owns 80 percent of the Prada Group and is controlled by the Prada family, is one of three entities that acquired the plot of disused land for roughly $ 190 million to convert it into a park, housing, offices and the Olympic Village for the 2026 Winter Games.)
Those with no interest in fashion have at least seen the house's triangular logo and know Prada's name, whether through movies (in 1999's teen comedy "10 Things I Hate About You," a student explains, "There's a difference between like and love. Because I like my Skechers, but I love my Prada backpack") and TV shows (in a 2019 episode of "The Simpsons," Homer relieves himself behind "Prada Marfa," a replica of a Prada store created in 2005 near Marfa, Texas, by the artists Elmgreen & Dragset), books (Lauren Weisberger's 2003 novel, "The Devil Wears Prada," which became a hit film) or music (Beyoncé, Doja Cat and Drake have all name-checked the brand). And yet no matter how far and wide her influence extends, Prada hasn't made it easy to know her, which is, like everything she does, deliberate.
Upon my arrival at the Prada headquarters, a set of stern buildings that occupy approximately 108,000 square feet, I'm confronted by my potential expulsion: the notorious stainless-steel slide connecting the designer's third-floor work space to the courtyard. The German artist Carsten Höller, who installed it in 2000, says it was intended to help her "leave quickly, traveling through the floor under her office to have a glance at the people working there and then land right where her chauffeur is waiting." But, he adds, "It's also a good way to get rid of people."
INTERVIEWING MIUCCIA PRADA, unlike talking to her, can be a tricky enterprise. From her desk in an austere room with white walls and poured concrete floors -- what might be mistaken for an operating theater, were it not for the Gerhard Richter painting and a silver bar cart stacked with cookies -- she seems to begin every other sentence with, "Between us. ..." She is 5-foot-4, with hazel eyes and wavy blond hair, and has the measured confidence of someone who's about to deliver the bad news first. Despite her warmth and frequent laughter, she also seems ready, maybe even eager, to spar. She, too, is recording the conversation and taking notes. When I ask what she does to relax, her answer is "no."
Although she's less inscrutable than her intellectual peers -- Rei Kawakubo rarely speaks to journalists; Martin Margiela never has -- she's certainly not as flamboyant as Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana or Donatella Versace, flashier designers from the height of Italy's sex-bomb era. And while she refuses to acknowledge personal achievements ("I leave it to other people to say what I did," she says), she's not above engaging in some mythmaking of her own: There's a reason her last fragrance was called Paradoxe.
"If Harvard was a billionaire woman, it would be Miuccia Prada," says the Italian artist Francesco Vezzoli, her close friend and frequent travel companion. The Belgian stylist Olivier Rizzo, who has worked with her since 2005, tells me she's changed the way we dress and think about clothing "on every possible level on all levels forever and ever." She's "a challenger," says the Italian creative director Ferdinando Verderi, who has consulted for the brand since 2019. "She'd even challenge the idea of being a challenger." The American artist Theaster Gates, chairman of Prada's Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Council, says, "If you're trying to get a character sketch of Miuccia, she's [expletive] sincere. And sincerity is better than being right all the time." The actress Uma Thurman, who developed a relationship with the designer after wearing a lilac Prada gown to the 1995 Oscars, likens her to "a growing tree, letting herself have new barks," while the musician Frank Ocean, who was photographed for the brand's spring 2020 campaign, draws an analogy between her "tone," he says -- "how she resonates, basically" -- and the meditative sound of om. The Italian gallerist Carla Sozzani, the founder of the 10 Corso Como concept store in Milan, who remembers "applauding like children" with her friend at runway shows in the 1970s, says, "Some people are more reserved when they're in public. I'm not saying she's another person [in private], but she's more open."
Though that might be accurate, it's also true that no other female designer has produced such a robust body of autobiographical work. (The punk iconoclast Vivienne Westwood came closest; one screamed, the other sublimates.) Prada may not seem especially eager to reveal herself in conversation, but she's always communicated more freely through her clothes, which make the case against what she calls "cliché beauty" and "the isolation of fashion." Instead, she has grounded her work in the idea of a uniform -- she's as likely to find inspiration in nuns as in sex workers -- craving the proximity to what she considers more noble, or at least more honest, professions. If Yves Saint Laurent created a wardrobe for the modern woman in the 1960s, then Prada, a champion of bad taste and the jolie laide, gave her permission to be weird and mercurial; to be, in a sense, her. "One of the reasons I started doing clothes was because I couldn't find anything to wear," she says.
It's almost as if she comes up with her designs because they could be -- and maybe so that they will be -- deemed unflattering or unsexy. "She's always looking for something that's unseen," says the Russian stylist Lotta Volkova, who consults for Miu Miu, which was established in 1993 as a less intellectualized and slightly less expensive alternative to Prada. Earlier this year, at Miu Miu's fall 2023 show in Paris, some of the models wore underwear as outerwear; many had frizzy hair and cowlicks. The British hairstylist Guido Palau, who contributed to his first Prada show in 2004, says that the designer wanted the models to look as if they'd been caught in a gust of wind. A few seasons earlier, for Miu Miu's spring 2022 collection, Prada delivered raw-edge chino micro-miniskirts belted below the hip bone. "Sometimes it's the breasts, sometimes it's the back," she says about fashion's obsession with the female form. "What wasn't trendy was the lower waist, so I said, 'Let's make it as low as possible."' The garment, which was her way of poking fun at things like fashion magazines, showed up in all of them.
"It's a lot about being against something," she says. Prada's spring 1996 collection, its first of many "ugly chic" offerings, incorporated jarring colors (rust, mustard and "bile green," as one critic would call it) and banal prints (later described as "Formica"), a response to the relentless sex appeal at the time of brands like Gucci, then stewarded by Tom Ford. But for fall 2002, to avoid being reduced to her somewhat prim, vaguely retro aesthetic -- which had, however improbably, come to define Italian style as much as an Armani suit -- she released what became known as a "porno chic" collection of transparent PVC coats and knee-high black leather boots. "Clothes were never about doing clothes," she says. "It's about living different parts of your personality."
PRADA STILL RESIDES in the Milanese apartment where she and her two older siblings, Marina and Alberto, grew up. In 1958, her mother, Luisa Prada -- a "beautiful, elegant lady," says Sozzani -- took over Miuccia's grandfather's shop, which she then ran for nearly 20 years. Her father, Luigi Bianchi, owned a company that made putting-green mowers. The details of that period bore her. "Nothing bad, nothing good," she says. But she sits a bit straighter when it comes to her teenage years. "That," she says, "was the big political moment."
While enrolled at the University of Milan (where she also earned a Ph.D. in political science), Miu Miu, as she'd been known to her family since childhood, joined the youth-led demonstrations and worker strikes that became referred to across Europe as the protests of 1968 (an era that in Italy would morph into the violent Years of Lead). "I really believed we could transform the world," says Prada, who also studied mime for five years at Milan's Piccolo Teatro. When she was a young member of the Union of Italian Women, a feminist offshoot of the Communist Party, the films of Godard and Pier Paolo Pasolini, both avowed Marxists then, greatly influenced her; fashion, on the other hand, was considered an inconsequential pursuit. "I was ashamed," she says. "But nevertheless, I pursued it because I liked it."
She was also compelled by a sense of duty. "I started kind of against my will," she admits. "Somehow it just happened." A couple of years after taking control of the company, she attended a trade show where she met Bertelli, who had recently given up on an engineering degree to run a leather factory that manufactured belts and bags. "We started as competition, and we're still competing," she says fondly. "In the end, that's something that keeps us together."
People tend to speak about Bertelli, a shrewd industrialist who collects vintage sports cars and sails several yachts -- and with whom Prada has two children, Lorenzo Bertelli, 35, the Prada Group's head of corporate social responsibility, and Giulio Bertelli, 33, a sailboat racer -- as if they were describing a movie villain they're secretly rooting for. "He has amazing charm," says Sozzani. "You have to love Bertelli. Or you don't." Francesco Risso, Marni's creative director and a member of Prada's design team for eight years until 2016, recalls "the most theatrical fights" between the couple. "It didn't feel unhealthy ever, but it felt like fireworks, that's for sure," he says. But as much as they might bicker -- he was initially against, for example, her decision to do a sneaker collaboration; she released it anyway -- Bertelli is also quite protective of her: Seldom does one approach Prada about a project without going through him first.
"If I hadn't met my husband, I don't know if I would've done this job," says Prada, who set out opening factories with Bertelli and creating an international brand for "good women, bad women -- the richness of all these different people." The designer, who has no formal training and doesn't sketch, begins each collection with concepts rather than silhouettes. One of her earliest pieces, in 1984, was a statement of intent: a modest backpack made not from crocodile or calfskin but black Pocono, an army-grade nylon more commonly associated at the time with parachutes than with purses. Nearly 40 years later, that utilitarian bag and its many iterations remain unlikely objects of desire. "Any bourgeois subject that I approached," she says, "I always wanted to destroy it." (Well, maybe not any bourgeois subject: "You shouldn't eat, you shouldn't drink, you should just work and work and work," Risso recalls Prada telling him at one of his first staff meetings. "I could see that she was trying to push me to be better.")
With the 1988 debut of her ready-to-wear line -- some models came out in black and brown jackets inspired by men's tailoring, others in hot pink dresses with 1950s silhouettes; almost all of them in flats -- she introduced house codes that now include specific garments and accessories (knee-length skirts, bucket hats) and signature styles (geometric prints, color blocking). It's often said that she and her trusted design director, Fabio Zambernardi (who is leaving the brand this month after more than three decades), determine the trends one season that others follow the next, which, though true, is incomplete; the clothes are only one part of it. At some point, it became almost obligatory for luxury brands to mount cultural, educational or philanthropic initiatives. But back then, she was the only one. "Basically, now every fashion house is a cultural platform," says Vezzoli. "Bottega Veneta does a show with Gaetano Pesce chairs and Gaetano Pesce becomes the most sought-after Italian designer. Saint Laurent produces a movie for Pedro Almodóvar. But Prada did it 30 years ago."
The Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas, whose research and design studio, AMO, has created the environments for every Prada show since 2004, says that each season the conversation starts with a word or two to "trigger intentions." The prompts for the spring 2024 men's presentation, which featured curtains of slime dripping from the ceiling down to an industrial steel grate on the floor -- the cascading goo also made an appearance at September's spring 2024 women's show -- were "creepy," "flesh and skin" and "organic minimalism." James Jean, a Taiwanese American painter who in 2007 designed the wallpaper for the brand's SoHo store (his drawings of fantastical creatures and flowers were later printed on Art Nouveau-inspired skirts, trousers and bags for the spring 2008 collection), recalls their project beginning with three adjectives: "romantic," "nonlinear" and "surreal." The French sound artist Frédéric Sanchez, who has scored most Prada shows since the mid-90s, was, in a similar way, also creating for an idea of clothes rather than a finished garment. "With Margiela," says Sanchez about his other longtime collaborator, "it was very physical"; sometimes they'd even repeat the same soundtrack season after season. His experience with Prada, he says, has been more "cerebral."
It's difficult to overstate how radically Prada has changed the landscape of contemporary luxury, a word she hates ("hate," on the other hand, is one she really likes). These days, every reference seems to lead back to her, whether it's a padded headband or a utility vest. Such a fixture is Prada on other designers' mood boards that for her spring 2000 collection -- which she referred to as "the ABC of fashion" -- she paid homage not only to the work of Yves Saint Laurent but also, rather cheekily, to her own, in the form of reinterpreted cardigans and schoolboy shorts. And yet, what Prada has put out into the world feels more substantial and transgressive than a khaki crop top or the very notion of so-called quiet luxury -- both things, mind you, that came from her. "It's much cooler than being eccentric," says the designer Marc Jacobs, a friend of hers. "With Mrs. Prada, it's that thing of style with substance. It's not just a shell that looks good."
THE SOUL OF the Fondazione Prada is the Haunted House, a four-story gilded tower that contains work by the sculptors Robert Gober and Louise Bourgeois. On the second floor, there's a Bourgeois installation called "Cell (Clothes)" (1996), in which pants and dresses appear to be trapped by a ring of wooden doors. On the top floor, there's a 2010 wax sculpture by Gober of a child's leg -- almost Prada-like in a white sandal and matching ankle sock -- weighed down by an anchor. There are no other clothes on this floor. Instead, Gober has installed a storm drain with water running beneath it. Under the metal bars, among the rocks and debris, sits an illuminated heart -- discarded, but still beating.
Journalists inevitably like to bring up Prada's political past, and not just because she likes to bring it up, too -- though as a New Yorker article about her from 2004 notes, "in the '60s it was almost a rite of passage for thousands of young middle-class Italians" to join the Communist Party. Prada, however, does seem to have a genuine need to reconcile the idealism of her youth with the choices she's made since; and if ambivalence can be paralyzing, in her case it appears to have had the opposite effect. In 1993, her days of on-the-ground protest behind her -- she'd long stopped handing out flyers at rallies -- Prada and Bertelli created Milano Prada Arte, which later became the Fondazione Prada. It would give them a place to house their growing art collection but, for Prada, it also became a way to funnel her revolutionary spirit -- and her money. "I tell my people in the Fondazione all the time to thank me," she says. "I have to sell a lot of expensive handbags to run a museum." ("Handbags are not art," the British sculptor and painter Damien Hirst, a friend, recalls her saying. "Whereas when you meet other people, they're constantly telling you that they are art, and you need 100.")
From the beginning, Prada has been dutifully managing and scrutinizing every detail of the Fondazione's programming -- even showing up at Gober's studio in Manhattan to convince him to contribute. Gober remembers that when she appeared on his doorstep, she said, "Like everything else, I have to do this myself!" (Her exit was equally quotable: When Gober sent her home with some books, she took one look at the tote bag he offered and said, "I'll carry them.") In 1999, she and Bertelli dropped in on Koolhaas at his studio in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. "They were bored with their stores," Koolhaas says, and wanted him to oversee the construction of their New York flagship. "All my friends in the art world, or let's say in the cultural sector, were extremely skeptical whether this would be a desirable collaboration," he says. Koolhaas reimagined the Epicenter, as it's called, on the site of what was once the Guggenheim Museum's SoHo location, with an undulating wood floor and motorized hanging displays. In 2008, OMA, Koolhaas's firm, was hired to design the Fondazione Prada.
Thirty years in, having worked tirelessly to earn her place in the art world, Prada has chosen to become the new director of the foundation. "My main track is [the Fondazione Prada]," she says. "I'd decided that I wanted to keep it separate from fashion. And no one knew -- I never told anybody." As she deliberates over what to say next, I'm reminded of something that the filmmaker Wes Anderson -- who's partnered with her on various film and art projects and who designed Bar Luce, the 1950s-style cafe at the Fondazione Prada -- told me. "You quickly sense her vulnerability, which can sort of disappear from a person with such authority. I think without a bit of that, you can't quite reach them. She can be fearless, but I don't think she's fearless," he wrote in an email. "Maybe it's because I'm getting older," Prada continues, "but I want to reconcile my whole life and declare my job: I run the Fondazione."
"She's properly a patron," says Hirst. "She really, genuinely sees art as something beneficial to other people." And unlike almost every other collector who tells him they're building a museum, he says, she actually did. The two were out to dinner one night when Hirst, who grew up working class, ordered caviar for the table. Prada sighed. "I really struggle to eat caviar," she said. "Why would you struggle with that?" he recalls saying. "And she was like, 'Oh, I was a communist."'
FOR THE PAST few years, Miuccia Prada hasn't had to do quite as much all by herself. In February 2020, just before the pandemic forced Italy into lockdown, the Belgian designer Raf Simons was announced as her co-creative director. The two of them, she said, would be jointly responsible for Prada's women's and men's wear going forward. (She's still the sole designer at Miu Miu; "When I change floors, I change mentalities," she says.) The next day, Simons flew home to Antwerp. Upon his return to Milan that June, he mostly communicated with Prada through a screen.
It was a challenging start to an ambitious experiment. They both had simple reasons for wanting it to succeed. Prada was, as she puts it, "fed up working alone." She was also, of course, planning her succession. "But they don't want me to talk about that because they're afraid it looks like I want to leave," she says. "I don't want to leave at all." Simons, 55, had briefly worked for Prada and Bertelli before going to Dior and then Calvin Klein. (He was the creative director of Jil Sander from 2005 until 2012; the Prada Group sold the brand in 2006.) Following his two-year stint at Calvin Klein, a tumultuous period he describes as "hysteria," he'd vowed to never again run someone else's fashion brand.
"I'm not a stupid guy," says Simons, who now lives in the Milanese apartment where the first Prada shows took place. When Bertelli reached out to set up a meeting, Simons says he knew they wouldn't be discussing Church's shoes. "It was more like, 'Miuccia and I, this is our age, this is our reality,"' he recalls Bertelli saying. (In January, she and Bertelli stepped down as co-chief executive officers of the Prada Group and were replaced by Andrea Guerra, formerly the chief executive officer of the Luxottica eyewear conglomerate. Their son Lorenzo is expected to assume the role down the line.) Prada had wondered if Simons, who'd overseen his own cultish men's wear brand for 24 years at that point (the line has since been discontinued), might want to look after the men's collections. "But in three seconds," says Prada, Simons suggested, " 'Why don't we do the two together?' And I immediately said, 'Yes, why not."'
In practice, they couldn't be more different. Simons, whose cool aesthetic conveys restraint, would rather adhere to deadlines; she "loves to design today what needs to go on the runway tomorrow," he says. And yet they share an aversion to traditional clothes. "It wasn't a shock, like, 'Oh my god, what a left-field choice,"' says Marc Jacobs. "If I were doing this movie, I'd have cast Raf."
After years of having to make every decision on her own -- even now, she's thinking about the most recent installment of "Women's Tales," Miu Miu's ongoing short film series, by the Croatian-born director Antoneta Alamat Kusijanović, and the Fondazione's next two art shows -- Prada is relieved to sit down with Simons and discuss the upcoming women's collection. "Listen," she says the day after the men's show in June from her office, where she's spent part of the morning reading the (good) reviews. "Every single moment you have to have ideas on so many things. Your brain evaporates." Recently, she and Simons have resolved, at least temporarily, not to divulge the references or describe the characters in their collections with the world. "I decided that I didn't want to tell stories anymore," she says. "We'll see how long it lasts."
When it comes to how her own story is eventually told, she hopes not to have, as she puts it, "thrown my life out on superficial things." Her goal, today, as it was in 1968, is to have done something good. "And deep down," she says, "political." But on my way out, I ask Prada if she ever wonders how her life might have looked had she not become a designer. "Always," she says without hesitation. Then, as the elevator door begins to close between us, she smiles. "And never."

Full text: He entered publishing when he was 43, then published many of the most popular books of recent decades, including "The Da Vinci Code."
Stephen Rubin, a book-business fortune seeker who helped make John Grisham and Dan Brown famous writers and who published Michael Wolff's 2018 chronicle of the Trump White House, "Fire and Fury," died on Friday in Manhattan. He was 81.
The cause of his death, at a hospital, was complications of sepsis that arose after a recent infection, his nephew David Rotter said.
Mr. Rubin was a patron of classical music who employed a chauffeur. Yet he was also a child of the working-class Bronx who valued literary prestige less than the bottom line.
"When I read something that I know is simply wonderful, I see dollar signs," he told The New York Times for a 2018 profile.
In that same article, Jonathan Karp, president and chief executive of Simon & Schuster, called Mr. Rubin "the quintessential hitmaker."
"He is to the book business," Mr. Karp said, "what Clive Davis is to the music industry."
Mr. Rubin was a 43-year-old freelance journalist and out-of-work magazine editor when he took his first job in publishing, at Bantam Books.
He had to ask his boss what the industry use of the word "royalty" meant, but he also showed initiative. For the first original novel he bought, "Destiny," by Sally Beauman, he paid $ 1,015,000, then the highest advance ever given to an unknown author. The novel became a best seller.
Nine months after he was hired, Mr. Rubin became Bantam's editor in chief. Just a few years after that, in 1990, he took over Doubleday, which, like Bantam, was owned by the German conglomerate Bertelsmann. He continued placing million-dollar bets on unpublished books.
"Trying to publish big-ticket best sellers is the riskiest game you can play," Mr. Rubin wrote in his memoir, "Words and Music: Confessions of an Optimist," published by Rowman & Littlefield in January. "But it has been my modus operandi."
When he arrived at Doubleday, the imprint was about to publish "The Firm," the second book by a little-known novel-writing lawyer and former Mississippi state legislator named John Grisham. When "The Firm" began to take off, Mr. Rubin invested heavily in advertising both the book and Mr. Grisham himself. Doubleday released a hardcover version of Mr. Grisham's unsung first novel, "A Time to Kill," and that, too, became a best seller.
The two men kept working together for nearly 20 years, a period during which Mr. Grisham wrote a popular new book more or less annually.
"He was involved in every aspect of each book, from the story to the title to the marketing," Mr. Grisham said in a phone interview. "Even late in my career, when I'd sold so many books you wouldn't think I'd have to listen to anybody, Steve wouldn't spare me the tough criticism -- and he'd often be right."
In the early 2000s, Mr. Rubin -- now running Doubleday Broadway, a restructured firm under the corporate umbrella of Random House -- appraised the work of another unproven novelist, Dan Brown. Mr. Brown had already written three novels, but they had all sold poorly. Mr. Rubin read a new proposal of his and spent $ 400,000 on a two-book deal.
In 2003, Mr. Rubin published Mr. Brown's "The Da Vinci Code," a suspenseful tale of centuries-old cults and secret Christian mythology that became one of the most popular books of the modern era. It sold more than 80 million copies, was translated into numerous languages (including Uyghur), incited the Vatican to appoint a cardinal to rebut what it called "shameful and unfounded errors" and inspired a movie that grossed about $ 760 million worldwide.
"The momentum in New York's most important publishing house isn't coming from the charismatic Sonny Mehta (old news) or the free-spending Ann Godoff (moved to Penguin)," New York magazine wrote in 2006. "Instead, Random House's considerable power now lies with Rubin, the expansionist publisher of the Doubleday Broadway imprint."
Mr. Rubin used the riches earned from "The Da Vinci Code" to expand the imprint while his competitors shrank. "Lock up your editors," one industry insider told New York.
But by October 2008, Doubleday's fortunes had turned. The imprint laid off 10 percent of its employees, and soon thereafter it merged with Knopf, empowering Knopf's publisher, Mr. Mehta, over Mr. Rubin, whose new position, publisher at large, gave him a grand title but much less actual power.
New York magazine developed a new epithet for Mr. Rubin: "the Icarus of big-advance publishing."
In 2009, he became president and publisher of Henry Holt, a smaller firm without Doubleday's pedigree. He quickly made a characteristically big bet, paying about $ 6 million for the Fox News personality Bill O'Reilly and a co-writer, Martin Dugard, to write "Killing Lincoln," a work of history about Abraham Lincoln's assassination written in the style of a thriller.
It sold millions of copies and kicked off a whole series of popular (if factually challenged) assassination books by Mr. O'Reilly and Mr. Dugard, which brought Holt "unheard-of amounts of money," Mr. Rubin later told Publishers Weekly. The company began paying Mr. O'Reilly eight-figure advances.
In 2018, at 76 years old, Mr. Rubin was set to hit it big one more time. Less than two months after Holt published it, Michael Wolff's "Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House" had sold more than 900,000 copies, not including e-book sales and audio downloads. It helped cause a rift, never entirely healed, between President Donald J. Trump and his adviser Steve Bannon; inspired an opening sketch on "Saturday Night Live"; and was even read aloud by Hillary Clinton at the Grammy Awards.
Mr. Wolff said that his plans for the book rapidly changed while he worked on it, but that Mr. Rubin remained faithful to the project throughout.
"He's the kind of guy you really want when you're writing a book and you're full of doubts," Mr. Wolff told The Times in 2018. "You want an upper, not a downer."
Stephen Edward Rubin was born on Nov. 10, 1941, in the Bronx, where he grew up. His parents were both the children of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. Irving, his father, ran a buckle-manufacturing plant in Brooklyn with his brother. Evelyn (Halpern) Rubin, Steve's mother, was a homemaker.
Mr. Rubin earned a bachelor's degree from New York University and a master's in journalism from Boston University.
In the 1970s, Mr. Rubin wrote frequently about classical music for The Times. He also founded and ran his own news syndicate of freelance writers, Writers Bloc, and in the early 1980s he was briefly an editor at Vanity Fair.
Among the other notable books Mr. Rubin published were two 2003 novels, Mark Haddon's "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time" and Lauren Weisberger's "The Devil Wears Prada" (which was also adapted for a movie, released in 2006).
Mr. Rubin faced a dilemma in 2017 when one of his star moneymakers, Mr. O'Reilly, became the subject of a New York Times investigation that revealed multiple allegations of sexual harassment. Mr. O'Reilly lost his job at Fox News and his representation by two talent agencies, but Holt remained committed to him. "The corporate stance is that it's not our job to judge our authors," Mr. Rubin told The Times in 2018.
Yet Mr. O'Reilly's sales quickly plunged. "People had to forgo their bonuses," Mr. Rubin told Publishers Weekly this year. In 2020, he left Holt and became a consulting publisher for Simon & Schuster.
In addition to his work in publishing, Mr. Rubin created the Rubin Institute for Music Criticism, which has trained classical music critics and provided newspapers with funding to publish music writing.
Mr. Rubin's gossipy memoir named which best sellers he thought nobody actually read (Thomas Piketty's "Capital," Stephen Hawking's "A Brief History of Time" and, he wrote, the whole oeuvre of Thomas Pynchon); cataloged his biggest failures (including books by Billy Crystal, Mia Farrow and Anita Hill); and chronicled episodes of corporate infighting.
In 1966, Mr. Rubin met Cynthia Robbins, a manager and publicist whose focus was opera. They began dating, married later in life and stayed together until she died in 2010. (No immediate family members survive.)
Mr. Rubin's response to the success of "Fire and Fury" was mostly characteristic. He exulted to The Times about its selling "a kajillion copies." But in his memoir, he struck a newly wistful tone about the place of books in mass culture.
"In an era when social media and cable television dominate the conversation," he wrote, "it is thrilling that one lone book could cut through all the static and have a profound effect on an entire nation."

Stephen Rubin, a book-business fortune seeker who helped make John Grisham and Dan Brown famous writers and who published Michael Wolff’s 2018 chronicle of the Trump White House, “Fire and Fury,” died Friday in Manhattan. He was 81.
The cause of his death, at a hospital, was complications of sepsis that arose after a recent infection, his nephew David Rotter said.
Rubin was a patron of classical music who employed a chauffeur. Yet he was also a child of the working-class Bronx who valued literary prestige less than the bottom line.
“When I read something that I know is simply wonderful, I see dollar signs,” he told The New York Times for a 2018 profile.
In that same article, Jonathan Karp, president and CEO of Simon & Schuster, called Rubin “the quintessential hitmaker.” “He is to the book business,” Karp said, “what Clive Davis is to the music industry.”
Rubin was a 43-year-old freelance journalist and out-of-work magazine editor when he took his first job in publishing, at Bantam Books.
He had to ask his boss what the industry use of the word “royalty” meant, but he also showed initiative. For the first original novel he bought, “Destiny” by Sally Beauman, he paid $1,015,000, then the highest advance ever given to an unknown author. The novel became a bestseller.
Nine months after he was hired, Rubin became Bantam’s editor-in-chief. Just a few years after that, in 1990, he took over Doubleday (which, like Bantam, was owned by German conglomerate Bertelsmann). He continued placing million-dollar bets on unpublished books.
“Trying to publish big-ticket bestsellers is the riskiest game you can play,” Rubin wrote in his memoir, “Words and Music: Confessions of an Optimist,” published by Rowman & Littlefield in January. “But it has been my modus operandi.”
When he arrived at Doubleday, the imprint was about to publish “The Firm,” the second book by a little-known novel-writing lawyer and former Mississippi state legislator named John Grisham. When “The Firm” began to take off, Rubin invested heavily in advertising both the book and Grisham himself. Doubleday released a hardcover version of Grisham’s unsung first novel, “A Time to Kill,” and that, too, became a bestseller.
The two men kept working together for nearly 20 years, a period during which Grisham wrote a popular new book more or less annually.
“He was involved in every aspect of each book, from the story to the title to the marketing,” Grisham said in a phone interview. “Even late in my career, when I’d sold so many books you wouldn’t think I’d have to listen to anybody, Steve wouldn’t spare me the tough criticism — and he’d often be right.”
In the early 2000s, Rubin — now running Doubleday Broadway, a restructured firm under the corporate umbrella of Random House — appraised the work of another unproven novelist, Dan Brown. Brown had already written three novels, but they had all sold poorly. Rubin read a new proposal of his and spent $400,000 on a two-book deal.
In 2003, Rubin published Brown’s “The Da Vinci Code,” a suspenseful tale of centuries-old cults and secret Christian mythology that became one of the most popular books of the modern era. It sold more than 80 million copies, was translated into numerous languages (including Uyghur), incited the Vatican to appoint a cardinal to rebut what it called “shameful and unfounded errors” and inspired a movie that grossed about $760 million worldwide.
“The momentum in New York’s most important publishing house isn’t coming from the charismatic Sonny Mehta (old news) or the free-spending Ann Godoff (moved to Penguin),” New York magazine wrote in 2006. “Instead, Random House’s considerable power now lies with Rubin, the expansionist publisher of the Doubleday Broadway imprint.”
Rubin used the riches earned from “The Da Vinci Code” to expand the imprint while his competitors shrank. “Lock up your editors,” one industry insider told New York.
But by October 2008, Doubleday’s fortunes had turned. The imprint laid off 10% of its employees, and soon thereafter it merged with Knopf, empowering Knopf’s publisher, Mehta, over Rubin, whose new position, publisher at large, gave him a grand title but much less actual power.
New York magazine developed a new epithet for Rubin: “the Icarus of big-advance publishing.”
In 2009, he became president and publisher of Henry Holt, a smaller firm without Doubleday’s pedigree. He quickly made a characteristically big bet, paying about $6 million for Fox News personality Bill O’Reilly and a co-writer, Martin Dugard, to write “Killing Lincoln,” a work of history about Abraham Lincoln’s assassination written in the style of a thriller.
It sold millions of copies and kicked off a whole series of popular (if factually challenged) assassination books by O’Reilly and Dugard, which brought Holt “unheard-of amounts of money,” Rubin later told Publishers Weekly. The company began paying O’Reilly eight-figure advances.
In 2018, at 76 years old, Rubin was set to hit it big one more time. Less than two months after Holt published it, Michael Wolff’s “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House” had sold more than 900,000 copies, not including e-book sales and audio downloads. It helped cause a rift, never entirely healed, between President Donald Trump and his adviser Steve Bannon; inspired an opening sketch on “Saturday Night Live”; and was even read aloud by Hillary Rodham Clinton at the Grammy Awards.
Wolff said that his plans for the book rapidly changed while he worked on it, but that Rubin remained faithful to the project throughout.
“He’s the kind of guy you really want when you’re writing a book and you’re full of doubts,” Wolff told the Times in 2018. “You want an upper, not a downer.”
Stephen Edward Rubin was born on Nov. 10, 1941, in the Bronx, where he grew up. His parents were both children of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. Irving, his father, ran a buckle manufacturing plant in Brooklyn with his brother. Evelyn (Halpern) Rubin, Steve’s mother, was a homemaker.
Rubin earned a bachelor’s degree from New York University and a master’s in journalism from Boston University.
In the 1970s, Rubin wrote frequently about classical music for the Times. He also founded and ran his own news syndicate of freelance writers, Writers Bloc, and in the early 1980s he was briefly an editor at Vanity Fair.
Among the other notable books Rubin published were two 2003 novels, Mark Haddon’s “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time” and Lauren Weisberger’s “The Devil Wears Prada,” (which was also adapted for a movie, released in 2006).
Rubin faced a dilemma in 2017 when one of his star moneymakers, O’Reilly, became the subject of a New York Times investigation that revealed multiple allegations of sexual harassment. O’Reilly lost his job at Fox News and his representation by two talent agencies, but Holt remained committed to him. “The corporate stance is that it’s not our job to judge our authors,” Rubin told the Times in 2018.
Yet O’Reilly’s sales quickly plunged. “People had to forgo their bonuses,” Rubin told Publishers Weekly this year. In 2020, he left Holt and became a consulting publisher for Simon & Schuster.
In addition to his work in publishing, Rubin created the Rubin Institute for Music Criticism, which has trained classical music critics and provided newspapers with funding to publish music writing.
Rubin’s gossipy memoir named which bestsellers he thought nobody actually read (Thomas Piketty’s “Capital,” Stephen Hawking’s “A Brief History of Time” and, he wrote, the whole oeuvre of Thomas Pynchon); cataloged his biggest failures (including books by Billy Crystal, Mia Farrow and Anita Hill); and chronicled episodes of corporate infighting.
In 1966, Rubin met Cynthia Robbins, a manager and publicist whose focus was opera. They began dating, married later in life and stayed together until she died in 2010. No immediate family members survive.
Rubin’s response to the success of “Fire and Fury” was mostly characteristic. He exulted to the Times about it selling “a kajillion copies.” But in his memoir, he struck a newly wistful tone about the place of books in mass culture.
“In an era when social media and cable television dominate the conversation,” he wrote, “it is thrilling that one lone book could cut through all the static and have a profound effect on an entire nation.”

Full text: Cristaseya isn't trying to hide, it just knows that the right people will find it.
Cristaseya is a decade-old clothing line operated by Cristina Casini and her husband Andrea Spotorno, two Italians who moved to Paris nearly 20 years ago from Milan. If you're lucky enough to know about it, the best place to shop for Cristaseya is the second floor of nondescript office building at 7 Rue Ambroise Thomas in the 9th arrondissement. Not only because the entire collection is there -- "This is the atelier, the showroom, the store, everything," Ms. Casini said one afternoon during Paris Fashion Week in late September -- but because it is difficult to find the line elsewhere.
Casa Cristaseya, as the Rue Ambroise Thomas space is called, is open by appointment only. Many of those who make one have been directed there by a fashion-insider friend with good taste. For the artist Martine Syms, who has collaborated with Prada, it was the fashion publicist Poppy Edmonds. For Emily Rahimpour, a creative director in Los Angeles whose clients include Byredo, it was the stylist Charlotte Collet. For Zoë Ghertner, the fashion photographer who shoots campaigns for Miu Miu and Chloe, it was Christiane Juergensen, who works with Phoebe Philo.
"There is no way I would've found out about it had it not been introduced to me by someone that I know and work with," Ms. Ghertner said.
Of the 45 or so stores that carry Cristaseya, most are in Japan with a few in the United States, including Mameg in Los Angeles, Viola Lovely in Boston, Oroboro in New York and AP Shop, a seasonal boutique in Lakeside, Mich., that is open Friday to Monday, May through January. No other store in France besides Casa Cristaseya carries the collection, and Cristaseya is not sold in Italy, despite the fact that Ms. Casini and Mr. Spotorno are Italian and much of their fabric comes from Italy and their production is done there.
"They think about luxury in the sense of luxury," Ms. Casini said, indicating the use of the term as a catchall for a certain price, branding and marketing style rather than a measure of the quality of goods and services. "That is not really what we like. Already the word 'luxury,' I don't like it because it's a bit, I don't know, vulgar."
Words Ms. Casini does like include "discreet" and "rareness." In the small world of Cristaseya, Ms. Casini and Mr. Spotorno enjoy complete freedom and control. Everything is a reflection of their personal curiosities and pleasures: a big wooden table Mr. Spotorno designed, an exhibition of photography by Jacob Holdt held in a gallery space upstairs from the showroom.
The clothes bear the influence of traditional Italian and Japanese tailoring. (Keiko Seya, an original partner, left the company a few years ago and now runs the label Seya.) Ms. Casini was previously a stylist. Mr. Spotorno photographs and art directs all of the imagery for the collection, sometimes using Cristaseya's two other employees -- Wonji Hong, the collection director, and Herta Bernane, the sales director -- as models. The look is arty but playful. It's not sexy, but it's smart in its slightly twisted understatement.
Ms. Rahimpour was introduced to Cristaseya in its early days and was charmed by Ms. Casini and Mr. Spotorno's approach. At the time, Ms. Rahimpour was working as the in-house art director for Chanel Beauty.
"I entered the company at a time when it was like a family business, and then it became this multinational, and everything at the time was turning into a multinational," she said. "Cristaseya is more about the clothes and the experience. You go to the atelier, and there's this tactile element. Like, the clothes on your skin. You feel comfortable, the fabrics are extraordinary."
For years, big department stores, like Le Bon Marché and Galeries Lafayette, and major e-commerce sites, like Matchesfashion.com and Ssense, have been trying to add Cristaseya to their vast assortments, but Ms. Casini and Mr. Spotorno refuse to sell to them.
"When everything looks the same with everything together, it's not special," Ms. Casini said. "We don't want to see the product there. And if I were a Cristaseya client, I wouldn't want to see the product there." Ssense, in particular, is known for buying an incomprehensible number of brands, many of which are destined to end up 70 percent marked down. "It's a bit sick," Ms. Casini said.
Cristaseya never goes on sale. It is expensive. An oversize reversible Japanese wool coat -- tentlike yet somehow elegant -- with leather piping is 2,806 euro (about $ 2,975). An oversize shirt, handmade by the Neapolitan shirtmaker Salvatore Piccolo, is 594 euros. An oversize baby camel's hair sweater is 1,169 euro. The fabrics and silhouettes, mostly unisex with a slightly raw, textured hand, are much more interesting and appealing in person than online. The collection does not abide by the fashion industry's traditional seasonal model, wherein there's spring, fall and two pre-collections, all of which are available for that season and then never again.
Cristaseya releases editions, two per year, and pieces from all editions are constantly in the mix. Edition 1 was called Winter Sky, and everything was navy. Edition 2 was Shirting. Edition 3 was Camel. Editions 18 and 19 were Sardegna, for which Ms. Casini and Mr. Spotorno branched out into ceramics, a "pibiones" style rug, picked out in raised loops, and 18-karat gold filigree jewelry that he designed and executed with local artisans from Sardinia. All of the knitwear is produced by Ms. Casini's mother's company Maglierie Cristina in Reggio Emilia.
"She really does it with love," Ms. Casini said.
In the beginning, Ms. Casini and Mr. Spotorno tried to avoid selling the collection online. "It's something that you have to experience, to touch -- it's expensive," Ms. Casini said. "You have to listen to the story, the savoir faire and tra-la-la. But then obviously, it was not possible to not do any online."
They've adopted a quirky model. The online shop opens temporarily and seemingly arbitrarily -- a week here, a few days there -- posted to Cristaseya's email distribution list and on Instagram.
"I think it's interesting," said Salima Boufelfel, the owner of the Desert Vintage stores in Arizona and New York. "I like the feeling of it."
This limited-access modus operandi is less about driving hype and intrigue for hype and intrigue's sake, in the way that brands like Supreme have become famous for their drops, than about manpower and capacity. The four employees can handle only so much demand. "It's a lot of work," Mr. Spotorno said.
That said, clients can contact them at any time, and Ms. Bernane will send a link to a product page. "But it's not everybody contacting us," Ms. Casini said. "You really need to be very motivated."
This state of mind may make fashion giants shudder, but it's yielded a tight bond between Cristaseya and its clients. As Mr. Spotorno said, "We know them, they know us."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On a recent summer morning in New York, three sopranos, a director and a small crew gathered for a rehearsal of "The Hunt," a new opera by Kate Soper.
One soprano had a ukulele stored offstage. Another had a violin close at hand. And a third, placed center stage at the Miller Theater at Columbia University, mimed speaking into a smartphone as the day's blocking work began.
While that character, Fleur, primped and preened for an imagined camera as if on a livestream, she bragged about her "social media fluency" on an address to a "royal hiring academy." All three sopranos were creating separate, self-taped auditions, for a show within the show.
And yet: They were clearly doing so in some bygone era.
"The King seeks spotless maidens for the hunt of the unicorn," the sopranos recited in unison, "whose conquest will bring riches to our kingdom, expansion of our realm and everlasting power over all our enemies."
So far, so anachronistic. All of this, though, was precisely on brand for Soper, the composer and librettist of "The Hunt," who was also in the auditorium day, keeping a close eye on the early rehearsal for the opera, which premieres at the Miller on Oct. 12.
Ever since her witty and sophisticated chamber opera "Here Be Sirens," from 2014, Soper has been plying fields similar to the one she has cultivated in "The Hunt." She consistently borrows ancient literary texts and tropes -- freely quoting from and playing with, say, Aristotle or Christine de Pizan -- in dramatic works that have contemporary urgency and comic thrust.
"The Hunt" revives texts from Hildegard von Bingen and Thibaut de Champagne, among others. (On some occasions, Soper also writes her own translations.) And, as in "Sirens," the instrumentation is limited to what the soprano performers can play onstage while also singing her complex music.
Because of pandemic delays, this new opera is Soper's second major stage premiere of 2023: In February, her grandest dramatic creation to date, "The Romance of the Rose," made its belated debut at Long Beach Opera in California.
"Probably this is the only year of my life in which I'll have two opera premieres," Soper said, self-deprecatingly, with a laugh during a telephone interview. Still, there's nothing that suggests she won't remain in demand -- in New York, on the West Coast or even elsewhere.
After all, her work is readily available to curious listeners. An archival video of Morningside Opera's scrappy, celebrated production of "Sirens" -- which includes Soper in its cast -- can be streamed for free on Vimeo. And on YouTube, Long Beach Opera's more recent highlight reel from "Rose" shows Soper expanding her compositional palette.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In "Rose" there is the kind of experimentalism that Soper has regularly engaged in as co-director of the cutting-edge Wet Ink Ensemble. But there are also numbers that approach the hummable quality of show tunes.
"This is not the kind of opera I thought I would write when I was in grad school," Soper said. "That's part of what 'Sirens' is about, feeling just sort of disgruntled and ashamed of some of my musical impulses: 'No one's going to take me seriously if I write this stupid show-tunes stuff."'
She added that the character she sang in "Sirens" was "struggling with this idea that you can't have pleasure and intellect at the same time, or something. Like most people, I just sort of have gotten over my completely pointless hangups I had in my 20s or early 30s."
The soprano Christiana Cole, who plays Briar in "The Hunt," said that Soper's writing is some of the richest that they have sung, in a career that has encompassed both contemporary classical music and Elton John's stage adaptation of "The Devil Wears Prada."
"I have done so many new pieces in my career," Cole said. "Sometimes there are big hits and sometimes there are big misses." But in Soper's music, they added, avant-garde density merges with tunefulness in rare fashion.
"It's as though Kate has a microscope, and she uses it on every measure," Cole said. "The level of detail is not just incredible because it's maximalist and baroque at the same time -- but it's amazing because it sounds good."
In "The Hunt," Cole also plays the principal ukulele part, in songs that, they said, are not easily scanned for patterns.
"The way the words sit on this very Minimalist, repetitive, beautiful ukulele part that I'm playing -- the text sits differently every time," Cole said. "For the audience, the feeling is that you are both listening to something that is ancient, that has been around forever, and that also does something different to your body than any music you've ever heard."
There is asymmetry, too, in Soper's approach to contemporary political commentary in "The Hunt." While the opera mines ancient lore about unicorns and how to catch them -- per canonic literature, virgins are the best bait -- it also tweaks that received wisdom through contemporary discussions surrounding gender presentation. By consciously setting out to cast a nonbinary soprano for the role of Briar, Soper hoped to welcome transgender rights to her earlier explorations of gender.
"Sirens," Soper said, asked: "How do you go through life when you want to change who you are but can't? How do you deal with expectations, based on how you helplessly present yourself?"
By contrast, she sees "Rose" as being "a bit more open: like 'How do you stay in love?' And 'Who are you in love?' And 'How do you try to empathetically perceive the world, in other people, without constantly getting wrapped up in your own tendencies?"'
"The Hunt" is less concerned with those internal questions, and more with threats from the outside. "Certain new norms and ways of behaving -- and ways of reacting to thought -- seem suddenly medieval," Soper said. "Who has power, and who has rights?"
This opera, she added, is ultimately about how to "survive in a culture that is specifically hostile to what you are. And what do you do? What's the solution?"
In the interview, Soper didn't want to give an answer that would spoil "The Hunt." But the production's director, Ashley Tata, who also staged Soper's "Ipsa Dixit" at the Miller, pointed to the fact that the theater's listing for the show credits an intimacy choreographer -- so it isn't much of a spoiler to say that the opera embraces physical pleasure.
Soper said that there were "two things I felt I could offer, despite the lack of optimism I feel."
First, "When someone tells you that you're disgusting and shameful and you don't own your body, you can use your body to give and receive pleasure," she said. And second, "You can say: I can do what I want with my body. You actually do have autonomy."
The intimacy among performers in "The Hunt" is remarkable, in part because of the chaste turn that much of contemporary opera has pursued in a politically fraught era. By contrast, Soper's characters are always alive to the possibility of pleasure, even when the path forward is murky.
Also enjoyable is how literate her characters are in exploring their identities. "That tends to happen in my operas, that there's a self-conscious readership going on," Soper said. "In 'Here Be Sirens,' my character was constantly reading and referring to books -- as if that was going to help her."
These investigations are also laced with humor -- another seemingly lost art in American opera. And Soper hopes that the pleasure she allows for characters translates to enjoyment for audiences, too.
"Somehow it's important to me," she said. "I'm also going to write some dirty jokes in this opera. And I am a woman -- whatever, deal with it."

Full text: How Miuccia Prada -- and Miu Miu -- became the muse of the season. Plus a detour through Chanel and Louis Vuitton.
Want to know what you will wear next?
Quite possibly a rah-rah skirt so short it shows your rear end or (if you are of a mind-set that eschews rah-rah skirts) a pencil skirt or pair of trousers or even pair of men's swim trunks that sit so low on the hips they flirt with bumster-dom. They'll probably be cinched with a wide leather belt or at the very least expose the elastic logo waistband of your underwear.
With them, a schoolboy striped Oxford shirt, navy V-neck sweater and navy blazer. Or maybe you'll forget the pants and skirts entirely -- too much to think about! -- and just toss a jeweled flapper wrap dress or a gold brocade opera coat over your shirt. Then you might stuff an extra pair of shoes, the kind that gave you blisters so you had to put Band-Aids on your heels but you love them so you'll take them anyway, into your handbag before sprinting out the door.
Or that's what you may wear next if what appeared on the Miu Miu catwalk at the close of Paris Fashion Week is any indication.
But why, you say, scratching your head, would Miu Miu have anything to do with it?
Not just because the show was fantastic -- one that seemed to be channeling Simone de Beauvoir or Natalia Ginzburg en route to the flower market after a late night of pub quizzes and philosophical debate.
But because ever since Miuccia Prada enlisted Raf Simons as co-creative director at Prada in Milan, freeing herself up to pay more attention to what had always been seen as Prada's little sister line, the Miu Miu brand -- not to mention Mrs. Prada's whole aesthetic -- has quietly become one of the most influential in fashion.
If in doubt, simply consider the number of audience members who arrived at the show in hot pants and tights (not since the age of Mary Quant have so many upper thighs been so visible). Or consider how much Mrs. Prada's work has shaped what has appeared on other catwalks since this fashion month began.
Indeed, it would not be overstating things to say Mrs. Prada has been the muse of the season.
The Mrs. Prada Effect
It started during New York Fashion Week, when Joseph Altuzarra offered up what was essentially an ode to early Prada in cocooning uniform coats, sheer pencil skirts and frumpy knits -- a theme that was repeated three weeks later in Paris at Matthew M. Williams's show for Givenchy, which featured similar Prada-isms in pastel shades speckled among his lithe black dresses (elegant, but generic).
In Milan, short shorts -- the kind that looked an awful lot like the hot pants Mrs. Prada showed for Miu Miu last season, which were an evolution of the truncated skirts she showed the season before -- became the trend of the week at Gucci, Bally and Etro. Versace embraced the concept of the shorts set, which came in the wake of the Miu Miu set renaissance of early 2022.
Hot pants -- dotted with costume jewels even -- popped up again at Stella McCartney, paired with ruffled tuxedo shirts and cool suiting, amid the backdrop of the designer's sustainability market showcasing various material technologies, and a host of her own greatest hits. Even Victoria Beckham, who seems to be struggling to find a new fashion identity, threw some bodysuits, with undies peeking out around the edges, under cardigans into her mix of tailoring and transparency.
It's not that anyone is overtly referencing Mrs. Prada (or it's not like most of them are). But she has become so masterful at cozying up to the clichés of gender, burrowing down and recontextualizing them, so good at using clothes to wrestle with the desire to be pretty and frivolous and serious and stressed all at the same time that her work has started to shape the culture it reflects. In the real world of the street, and the digital world of influencers.
At which point it gets regurgitated back through the maw of other designers, amplifying the ideas. It's not trickle down or trickle up as much as trickle out.
A Detour to Vuitton and Chanel
The Miu Miu effect marks a pretty big shift in the biorhythms of fashion month. After all, years ago, when Mrs. Prada moved her Miu Miu show to Paris to create some breathing room between it and the Prada show in Milan, it was a sort of an addendum, or coda, to the week, after the mega brands of Chanel and Louis Vuitton had brought the season to an end. Lately, however, those shows seem increasingly niche; not smaller physically, but speaking mostly to an echo chamber of their own (paid) celebrities and acolytes.
Vuitton, for example, was held in the brand's new building on the Champs-Élysées, a former Art Deco palace hotel, now a construction site for what the brand would only describe as "a new project."
The soaring ground floor interior had been shrink-wrapped in orange plastic (100 percent recycled and 100 percent recyclable said the show notes) to resemble the interior of a hot-air balloon because, you know, travel (and the brand's birth as a trunk maker). And because the clothes from the designer Nicolas Ghesquière -- layers of striped and plaid mousseline belted at the hip, with leather jackets, candy-cane clown pants and elaborately beaded tweeds -- had their own floaty fussiness to match.
They were complicated-looking, no matter how light the construction, which paradoxically gave them a very French air. You don't want to wear them, but they are compelling all the same. Even if they also seem like a very acquired taste that might take too much effort to acquire, like sweetbreads.
At Chanel, meanwhile, Virginie Viard was riffing on the Villa de Noailles, the 1920s artistic salon in the South of France and the creative milieu Coco shared, with bouclés and seaside stripes, long-line bathing suits and flirty cover-ups, logos and flowers and pearls galore. The problem is, for every great piece -- a pleated black and white halter neck gown, for example, or a kind of ironically fun tweed caftan -- there's another that has all the subtlety of boardwalk souvenir shop Chanel without any of the irony.
"Whatever"
It's Mrs. Prada's self-awareness and ability to both love fashion and recognize the issues with it, to embrace the inherent tensions and related absurdity of even worrying about such tensions, that makes it possible for so many to recognize themselves (or their many selves) in her work.
"Fashion comes when you want a distraction, when you are not too serious," she said after the Miu Miu show. "But then you need to think about the rest, so you need clothes you can live with, and clothes that you can think with."
During the show, a piece of video art titled "Gravity & Grace" from the Qatari-American artist Sophia Al-Maria played on screens set up around the venue, featuring a stuntwoman, Ayesha Hussain, in those Prada hot pants, gas station jackets and knee-high boots, going through different exercises with a sword and a cross bow, and twirling around like a jewel-box ballerina. It didn't have much to do with what was on the runway, other than evincing, the show notes said, "a congruent intellectual viewpoint."
At the finale, after Cailee Spaeny -- the actor who plays Priscilla Presley in Sofia Coppola's coming biopic "Priscilla" -- had walked out in a plain black coat, the video flashed a close-up of a gum-chewing face and the word "whatever."
It was the perfect ending.

Fashion Royalty, Even Without the Crown: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: There are some people in fashion with such distinctive personal style trademarks that you can recognize them from their silhouettes. Karl Lagerfeld was one (remember the Diet Coke bottles?). Anna Wintour is another. And then, with her sky-high heels, narrow pencil skirts, shaggy bob and permanent presence on the front row of fashion week for more than 30 years, there is Carine Roitfeld.
The former French Vogue editor and stylist was a longtime collaborator with the likes of Mr. Lagerfeld and Tom Ford, as well as a principal architect of the hedonistic aesthetic that defined late 1990s fashion. After leaving French Vogue in 2011, she founded her own biannual publication, CR Fashion Book, which celebrates its 10th anniversary this year. The latest cover, released earlier this week, stars Kim Kardashian with razor-thin brows, a dirty white top and a buzz-cut wig, and was shot by Nadia Lee Cohen.
Lately Ms. Roitfeld has also been busy building a lifestyle empire, branching out into everything from perfumes to housewares as well as a new coffee-table book, "Fantasies," published earlier this month by Rizzoli (with a cover also featuring Ms. Kardashian).
She now occasionally uses a cane, but after turning 69 earlier this month, Ms. Roitfeld also appears to show no signs of slowing down. At the end of Milan Fashion Week -- and ahead of a big birthday bash in Paris on Sept. 27 -- she sat down to discuss getting older, her hand in shaping the intersection of fashion and pop culture and why she has no regrets about going it alone.
This interview has been edited and condensed.
In Milan, there were two major debuts at the houses of Gucci and Tom Ford. Given your long involvement with both of those brands, what did you think of what you saw?
The Tom Ford show was emotional for me because there were a lot of familiar faces in that room, including Peter [Hawkings], the new creative director who was Tom's right hand man and whom I have known for a long time. It was sexy, with a lot of references to the creative force of what Tom did both at Gucci and for his own brand. With Sabato [De Sarno] at Gucci, he is also a lovely guy. He was so unlucky with the weather and the fact the show location had to change. It was meant to be held in the streets, not a big black box. But it felt like a palate cleanser, and a real fresh start. Now he'll need to build on it.
You've been coming to Milan for almost 30 years. How has the way sex is presented on the fashion week runways changed since then?
I think it is more sanitized. I do think the 1990s were the best time for music and for fashion. And I think that is because people felt they had more freedom. Now we live in an age of anxiety where people are worried about everything -- like if they might get photographed by a cellphone or how they look on social media. That shapes people's sexuality and how they present themselves. There might be a lot of short shorts, but they don't always feel that sexy, you know? There was an emotional charge to many shows back then.
But I still see good shows that touch on sex now. The oozing latex curtain wall on the Prada runway this week felt very sensual to me. That was smart.
How has fashion week changed?
Social media has changed everything. There was no Instagram. The front row is now as much for TikTokers as it is for the people who have worked in fashion for 20 or 30 years. When everything is geared to be consumed online, something gets lost in the offline experience. Everyone films at the end of a show. No one is clapping.
Things change, I know that. But there is less space for us and I think it is a bit sad. For example, I couldn't congratulate Sabato after his show -- there were so many people backstage, all not talking, just holding up their phones and blocking the way. I waited for 10 minutes. Then I just gave up.
You've turned 69. Not a conventional big birthday to celebrate.
It's a good number. And I plan to stay 69 forever now, that's my new permanent age. So why not celebrate my last birthday party. It's going to be at Raspoutin, which is a nightclub in Paris my father used to go and sort of feels like home. Plus I have a lot going on that I feel proud of, like 10 years of CR Fashion Book. There are a lot of memories and we created a lot of great moments and careers in fashion. We, not me. I do not think of myself as a me, me, me person. Fashion is a team business. So my colleagues deserve to have a party, too.
When you look back on the last 10 years, what makes you proud?
When I left French Vogue, it was like giving back a royal crown. It's a huge title, everyone loved you and wanted your approval. And then I left, and then there was no team, no secretary, no automatic audience. Certain photographers were not allowed to work with me anymore. But it was really good for me to break out on my own at that stage in life. It forced me to find new contacts, look for new talent and do something that was truly my own.
Kim Kardashian is your cover star for the latest CR Fashion Book.
Yes and she's the cover of my new book, too. We have shot her before for CR Fashion Book -- working with Karl Lagerfeld and Riccardo Tisci. This time round, as you've seen, we shot her in a very surprising way. We've done a second cover with Jennifer Aniston, too.
Tell me about your tattoos. Are they new?
Yes, I've had them for about three or four months. On one finger is an Orthodox classic cross as I was raised in the Russian Orthodox Church. Then on another it says Odesa in Russian letters, where my family is from, and another says Paris. And I have the initials of those I love, and a small red band of thorns. I waited a long time to get these done -- 69 years. I had a lot of time to think about what to get.
On the subject of new things, you've also just started a housewares line.
Well yes, it's candles and diffusers for now, it's not furniture -- yet. But I do think smell is very important, it's very sensual and one of your very first impressions of a space. They're black. They're very chic. They're very me.
Then there is a new fragrance.
Yes, it's on me. Can you smell it? Forgive Me is the name. There is a lot of patchouli and white flowers. Making fragrances is very addictive, and I'd already got 7 Lovers [a perfume collection named for cities that inspire her and imaginary lovers in each of them]. Last year was Carine. And now this. The face of it will be my daughter, because she's very beautiful. Maybe the next one will have my granddaughter in the campaign.
Is family important to you?
Very. We are a small family but a very close one. My son, Vladimir, is my C.E.O. I dream of creating a new dynasty, a family fashion business that keeps creating the Roitfeld world.
When will you retire?
I don't have the luxury to retire. Honestly, I have too much going on and I'm not ready to stop and I am surrounded by people who are 25, which keeps me young. I think if I stopped it would just be boring.
But I have been making some life changes. I do sports and I have good DNA, and I'm lucky my body hasn't changed that much. But my skirts are now knee length, no matter what the new trends are. In Paris, I moved from the Left to the Right Bank. Anyone in Paris will tell you that to cross the river is a huge thing to do. And I've had to have five operations on my back. I do get tired; I do get worried I'll fall. So I use a cane now if I need to.
And where did you buy your cane or who makes it for you?
Amazon. 15 euros. A bargain!

Full text: Ahead of his first show at Milan Fashion Week, Sabato De Sarno talks family, tattoos and what he sings in the shower.
Last January, two months after Alessandro Michele shocked the fashion world by announcing he was leaving Gucci, a brand he had transformed into a trendsetter with $ 10 billion in revenue in 2022, the company named his successor, and that too shocked the fashion world. Who was this man, Sabato De Sarno, who would be stepping into Mr. Michele's fur-lined, logo-ed Gucci slides?
Little is known beyond basic biographical facts: Mr. De Sarno started his career at Prada before moving to Dolce & Gabbana and then Valentino, where he spent almost 14 years, ultimately becoming the fashion director in charge of men's and women's ready-to-wear.
Which is why, when I had the chance to sit down with Mr. De Sarno before his first Gucci show, I seized the moment to play 21 questions. Here is what I learned, in edited form, below.
What is your first memory?
I was about 7, in the small village I come from in the countryside, close to Naples. I was on a Vespa with my grandfather, just riding around, talking. He died 10 years ago, and we were very close. I have his name. When the announcement came out about Gucci, it made me very emotional because my father said, "I know Sabato would be very proud to read his name in the magazines."
What is your favorite food?
Eggplant Parmesan from my mother. She is the best cook in the world. She uses it to convince me to visit her in Como, where they live now. She says, "If you come home, I can make it for you." And always, she wins. I'm a terrible cook.
What else are you bad at?
I really like to drive, but people say I am a terrible driver. In Rome, I get around on city bikes.
What's your favorite ice cream flavor?
Stracciatella.
What is the first thing you do in the morning?
I have a dachshund named Luce, and she loves to sleep close to my feet. When I wake up, she just comes up, and we spend two or three minutes cuddling.
Do you sing in the shower?
Yes, pop music. This morning I was singing a song by Romy from the xx.
How did you celebrate your last birthday?
I just had my 40th birthday. It was at a nightclub. I love dance clubs. It was at the end of Valentino, the beginning of Gucci, and I decided to get together my colleagues, my family and my friends.
Relationship status?
I got married five years ago. My husband is a lawyer in Brussels at the European Union. We see each other on weekends. It works very well because when we stay together, we really have quality time: just me and him and our dog. We don't fight very often because if we fight, we need to make a peace before leaving.
What piece of clothing have you had the longest?
A dark navy worker's jacket I bought on Portobello Road when I was 19. It was the first moment I bought something as a piece of my wardrobe. I still wear it.
Do you have a uniform?
White sneakers from the brand I am working on, or Converse. Black Levi's and a black T-shirt in the summer and black sweater in the winter.
Wait ... isn't that the uniform of Pierpaolo Piccioli, your former boss at Valentino?
It's the same as Pierpaolo, but I did it before him.
What do you buy?
I just bought a lot of pieces of Raf Simons because it's his last collection and I love his shapes and his way to do men's wear. [Mr. Simons closed his namesake label at the end of 2022.] But then I just wear it for one hour or two in the house and put it away because I don't like to go out like that. It's strange, I know.
I also have a large collection of coats. I have about 200. The first one I bought was a prototype when I worked at Miu Miu. It looks like a coat, except it has no pockets.
Do you have any tattoos?
Four. On my right forearm, an Ellsworth Kelly flower, because I love Ellsworth Kelly. On my left wrist, a star, which was the first one my mother allowed me to get, and the number 3, which I got with my two good friends and they also have. Then higher up on that arm, "Ancora," which I just got.
It means again. It's a word I use a lot. Not "again" as in the past, but "again" as when you enjoy something and you want more. It is the name of my first collection for Gucci.
Who was the first person you told when you got the Gucci job?
My husband. It was a very emotional moment. We were crying. He said, "I knew that it would happen." I could hardly believe it. After I put my signature on the contract, I slept with it because I dream a lot, and sometimes when I wake up in the morning, I say, "Was it real or not?" But with my hand on the paper, I'd know it was real.
What has surprised you about Gucci so far?
The hugeness of the brand. OK, from outside you see that, but you don't really feel it until you have meetings with every single team around the world. I'm very open, and I don't have any system about meeting with my team. I'm Sabato, you just come in the door.
But I remember the first week I was at Gucci was strange because no one talked to me. They all wanted to make appointments. I finally just told everyone: "OK, I know I'm the creative director, but I was in your role just two weeks before. You don't have to wait for a meeting."
What is going to surprise people about your Gucci?
I think the first thing is I'm more real. I don't want to build another world. I don't like sets. I like when I see people in the street with my clothes. In fact, the first show is going to be in the street. Also, we have a new brand color: red. I love it.
Do you have a personal motto?
Avanti. Go ahead.
What's your favorite form of exercise?
I'm not really a sporty person. When I decide to start a sport, I go and buy all the stuff to make a nice look. I decided to swim, for example, because I started to think my shoulders were becoming too hunchy, so I bought the swimsuit, the nose plugs, the ear plugs, the towels. But then after three lessons ... that's it.
What is your favorite book?
It depends on the moment. I like Elena Ferrante because of the way she describes my city, Naples. I am reading a book by James Baldwin, "Giovanni's Room." And I read the Obama biographies -- Michelle and Barack -- at the same time. He reminds me of my husband.
What did your husband give you for your birthday?
A Cartier Love bracelet. I don't really like to wear jewelry, but I like to wear this.
What is the best gift you have ever given?
I bought a house for my parents in Como, where they live now. Honestly, I'm so proud about that. They are all coming to the show. My family -- I have two younger brothers and two nephews -- represents to me the place where I feel safe and I can be myself.

Full text: Tom Ford's new designer falls in, but Prada offers a fabulous escape hatch.
Ever dreamed of a do-over? Wished you could climb into a special mystery machine like Dr. Who and end up sometime in the late 20th century, before smartphones and social media, before alternative facts and the return of autocracy, when climate change was still a question mark, air conditioning could blast with impunity and hedonism was a subversively appealing marketing concept?
That kind of magical thinking is exactly how it felt on Thursday, walking through a wall-to-wall-carpet-lined tunnel into the Tom Ford show: the first major new designer debut of the Milan fashion season. It was the first live show since Mr. Ford sold his namesake brand to Estée Lauder, who in turn handed over the reins of the ready-to-wear to the Zegna Group; the first since Mr. Ford stepped down, and his longtime No. 2, Peter Hawkings, was appointed creative director in his place.
One minute you were outside in the Milanese rain, a crowd of looky-loos shrieking happily at Elizabeth Banks and Rebecca Dayan. The next minute, you were swirling down the decade drain into 1995 or '96 or '97, the era when Mr. Ford was busy reinventing Gucci and bringing excitement back to Milan with show sites covered in plush carpet to recreate a haute nightclub circa 1979.
It has been almost 20 years, cultural schisms and a whole other company since Mr. Ford left Gucci, and yet Mr. Hawkings, who could have taken his mentor's brand almost anywhere (literally and aesthetically), chose to bring everyone right back to the beginning.
And not just with the carpet and the décor, but with the clothes: an effective tour through Mr. Ford's greatest Gucci hits (with a touch of his Yves Saint Laurent) in 50-plus moments of déjà vu.
Remember the slinky jersey dresses cinched at the hip with a curvy, Elsa Peretti-inspired buckle from Gucci fall '96? They were here, in black with a bronze-buckle belt, the backs cut to the lowest curve of the spine. Remember the rock-star velvet pantsuits from the same collection? Ditto, in teal and raspberry (one with shorts, instead of pants). Remember the slick pencil skirts that Mr. Ford's Gucci stylist, Carine Roitfeld (sitting front row at Mr. Hawkings's show), once made her signature, along with slinky silk charmeuse silk shirts unbuttoned to the navel? Those too, though this time the skirts, like the slick suits for both men and women, were in faux patent leather croc rather than the real thing.
Every look came with a pair of shades and a stiletto sandal (or, for the men, a sharp leather boot). Most also included some gold chains and a clutch. The only thing lacking, really, was the follow spot. Oh, and the frisson of discovering the gleeful sex-power-strut thing.
After all, it's not quite the same any more. The world isn't; gender isn't; the relationship of sex and power isn't. So why double down on the past?
The Dress-Up Game
Maybe this was a transition collection; an attempt by a protégé to pay homage to the man who trained him by proving that he understood the legacy, and to show his new owners that he was a steady pair of hands. Maybe, in a season in which a new designer is about to debut at Gucci itself and rumors have been floating around about a return to that brand's classics, it was an effort to reclaim those looks; to out-Tom Ford the house that Mr. Ford helped build. Maybe, after 25 years of working with Mr. Ford, this is simply what Mr. Hawkings knows.
Or maybe Mr. Hawkings believes (correctly) that we live in a time of nostalgia for the past, especially that turn-of-the-millennium past, where generations that didn't experience it the first time around try to recreate it as closely possible the only way they really know how: pants!
After decades in men's wear, Mr. Hawkings is a dab hand at those (and he did succeed in uniting the Tom Ford men's wear and women's wear. But in doing that, he forgot one thing: When Mr. Ford first blew fashion open, he wasn't going through the motions of existing norms. He was unzipping them, with a dash of irony and a self-aware wink.
If Mr. Hawkings learned one thing from his mentor, it should have been that: Real seduction comes garbed in the confidence of an original point of view. After all, you can't repeat the past. You can just play dress-up in it.
Prada Plays the Slime Card, Beautifully
It's not that a designer needs to reject history (theirs, ours, a brand's) entirely -- if you don't learn from it, you are doomed to repeat it and yadda, yadda, yadda. But it needs to be remixed rather than reproduced, so that suddenly the familiar looks entirely different. That's how progress happens.
That's what Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons do so brilliantly at Prada, and what they did again this season.
Starting with slime, which oozed down from the ceiling in long, transparent sheets, bisecting the runway and pooling in sea-foam clumps on the floor, like some sort of delicate alien plasma (or sneaky metaphor).
"We had the '20s, '30s, sort of sliding together, and then the '90s, and some '80s," Mr. Simons said backstage after the show, as he and Mrs. Prada were swarmed by the usual flock of well-wishers and journalists pecking at their crumbs of wisdom.
He was talking about the echoes of decades past in iridescent organza shift dresses bathed in dawn shades, wisps of material floating behind them like mist. Talking about the strong-shoulder suit jackets that narrowed to a point at the waist over tiny tailored shorts. With, perhaps, a shard of a chiffon scarf thrown over the shoulders for good measure -- and a gold or silver carwash skirt, or at least notional skirt, belted atop, like a can-can dancer on her way to a board meeting.
He was talking about the Milky Way swirls of rhinestones and comet trails of silver grommets that decorated leather and velvet frocks, under distressed oversize barn coats (they are turning into something of a trend this season, as seen in '80s-style dyed denim at Max Mara and at Etro). Not to mention the freaky little baldheaded icon that doubled as a handbag clasp and turned out to be a recreation of a bag clasp from around 1913, when Mrs. Prada's grandfather founded the brand.
It was, Mrs. Prada said, a "mythological head," but set against the ominous strains of the "Vertigo" soundtrack, it bore an unsettling resemblance to Alfred Hitchcock, peering out from an alternate accessories dimension.
The effect was to de- and re- contextualize the clichés of femininity and masculinity; to challenge any entrenched sense of surety about what is fancy, what is professional, what is kitschy, what is tough, what is fragile. And in doing so, open up the sense of what is possible.
"It's about shifting things," Mr. Simons said backstage. Expectations, preconceptions, the ground under everyone's feet.

Full text: For years, Matthieu Blazy was a fashion ghost: a specter whispered about but rarely seen. "The most famous designer you've never heard of," New York magazine crowed in 2014.
At only 30, he was said to be the man behind the renaissance of Margiela couture, after the brand's founding designer left the house. A few years later, he was rumored to be the secret sauce in Phoebe Philo's Céline collections. Then he was spotted at Calvin Klein, helping reinvent it under Raf Simons. His name kept coming up in reference to top designer jobs, but he never took a bow at the end of the runway. He was rarely photographed. He didn't hang out with celebrities.
"You can't keep such a talent under wraps," Suzy Menkes wrote in British Vogue. Except he did.
Until now.
In late 2021 Mr. Blazy, now 39, became the creative director of Bottega Veneta, after its previous designer, Daniel Lee, who had reinvented the brand in only three years, departed under a cloud of rumors about misbehavior and high employee turnover. Mr. Blazy, who had been Mr. Lee's No. 2, inherited not just his headline gig, but a house shrouded in innuendo and in need of yet another sprinkling of fairy dust. What did he do?
He changed leather into denim, flannel, ribbed cotton and knit and fooled everyone. He pulled the rug out from under assumptions in the most gracious way and made the everyday into precious objects that only the wearer really understood. He created a world -- one where nothing is quite as it seems -- and populated it with an entire assortment of passers-by. He played sleight of hand with the hierarchy of taste.
And he did it so effectively that this month Bergdorf Goodman in New York, which always devotes its fashion week windows to what Linda Fargo, the senior vice president for fashion and store presentation, described as "the best fashion of the season," filled three of its windows with Bottega -- and only Bottega. Two years into the job, Mr. Blazy hasn't just redefined a brand, he has defined a direction.
Lately there has been a growing rift in the fashion world between designers who make content and designers who make clothes. The content crew considers fashion as a subset of entertainment; the clothes crew sees fashion as a service.
The appointment of Pharrell Williams as creative director of Louis Vuitton men's wear was in many ways the apotheosis of the content phenomenon, in which what matters is the spectacle and how it resonates through the world. The garments serve as souvenirs that allow you to buy into the experience and advertise your belonging.
Mr. Blazy has become the epitome of an alternative approach: a designer who puts himself second to the products, the people who make them and the people who buy them. "He doesn't see himself in the driver's seat of the company," said François-Henri Pinault, the chief executive of Kering, the group that owns Bottega Veneta. "He sees himself in the middle of the car."
Which is not to say he doesn't know exactly where everyone is going.
House Building
"I said I wanted to go against the stream of the monovision," Mr. Blazy said, talking about his initial pitch to Mr. Pinault. He was in his office in the Bottega Veneta headquarters in Milan, wearing a white Patagonia T-shirt and faded jeans.
He told Mr. Pinault he thought Bottega should focus on craft, rather than design; that it should be "a house, not a brand." That may sound like semantics but is the difference between a garment that advertises its point of origin and a garment that slips seamlessly into a wardrobe. And it was very different from the approach of Mr. Lee, who had made Bottega so associated with a single color -- a bright, herbalicious green -- that you could identify a piece from blocks away. It also explains a lot about how Mr. Blazy approaches not his job, but the world.
When he moved into his office, which was a white box, he had the walls repaneled in wood tinted a rich brown so they looked like a "chalet in Chamonix," and the room felt more domestic. Now it is anchored at one end by a seating area with an Isa Genzken Nefertiti head on a pedestal and, at the other, by a long table for meetings. The table has a bowl of Ricola lemon mint lozenges, but no computer.
"I did not open a computer for the last six months," Mr. Blazy said. "I have two, but I don't use them so much. I sketch a lot and talk a lot and look at books, and I have a phone." On the floor, below enormous windows, were 16 different piles of paper, each one corresponding to a different collection or project: perfume, new store concepts, the fanzines he creates with people he admires (most recently the British designer Hussein Chalayan, which involved Mr. Chalayan playing with pen and ink, watercolor and glitter to draw pieces from Mr. Blazy's last show).
On the walls were a series of artworks. Mr. Blazy collects first drafts. It started, he said, because that's all he could afford, and he liked the idea that they were "the first expression of something." Then, he said, he couldn't stop.
"It's not that I need to have more more more," he said. "But two or three times a year I try to find something that makes me happy to live with. I would rather have my money on the wall than in the bank."
When he likes something -- Marlboro Lights (he smokes a pack a day); stracciatella (the ice cream with tiny shavings of chocolate that he loves so much he had a special rug designed in its image for his last show; it is now in his office); the Gaetano Pesce chairs he commissioned for the show before that -- he whispers, "It's wonderful," and his eyes light up like a 10-year-old seeing snow for the very first time.
"He can get inspired by anything," said Pierre Debusschere, the image and music director for Bottega, who is a close friend. It is not a coincidence that one of Mr. Blazy's favorite sites in Milan is the Church of Santa Maria presso San Satiro, which features a "false apse" that from the front appears to recede into the distance but up close turns out to be a flat wall painted in trompe l'oeil.
The way Raf Simons, the co-creative director of Prada, who has been Mr. Blazy's boss twice, and is one of his closest friends, puts it is: "Matt is very free in his head. He has no fear of showing anything he believes in creatively. He always had so many ideas: Add latex kitchen gloves! What about a marching band jacket? Some made completely no sense, and some were so genius I would say, 'Of course, we are going to do that."'
Of Course, We Are Going to Do That
"In the past I've been proposed a few beautiful houses," Mr. Blazy said, talking about job offers that came his way before Bottega Veneta. He wouldn't name names, saying only that "one was very beautiful, about craft, one was very commercial but still about fashion, and one was a smaller house that I thought could be reactivated without being passé. But I never felt it was the right time. I saw a lot of designers taking stuff quickly, and for me it was important to build myself first. I wanted to know my job. Know myself."
Mr. Blazy grew up in Paris. His father is an expert in pre-Columbian art, and his mother a historian and researcher; he has an older brother who is an airplane pilot and a twin sister who works in Singapore. He was a rambunctious kid -- so much so that when he was 13, his parents sent him to a Marist school in the French countryside, and when that didn't take, to Pangbourne College, a military boarding school in England for a year. (He said he liked it.)
He thought about going into archaeology but ended up at La Cambre, the fashion school in Brussels, because his mother thought it would be good for him to have a skill; Julien Dossena, the creative director of Rabanne, was in his class; Anthony Vaccarello, the creative director of Saint Laurent, was a year above. His graduate collection was about Claudie Haigneré, the first Frenchwoman in space, who became the minister of science, and involved "big fur coats covered in silver fabric," Mr. Blazy said. "I had a lot of fun."
Mr. Simons liked the collection so much he offered Mr. Blazy a job at his namesake label as a men's designer. Another designer named Pieter Mulier was already working there, and he and Mr. Blazy soon became a couple.
"We did everything together," Mr. Simons said. "Go to fabric fairs in Paris, go to the movies, go on vacation."
Four years later, however, and still in his 20s, Mr. Blazy jumped to the Margiela Artisanal collection, that brand's equivalent of couture. That's where he began to experiment with the idea of transformation; using one kind of material (plastic hair combs) to represent another (fringe).
"I could really use my passion digging, being curious," he said. But, he said, he was worried he would be pigeonholed as a conceptualist, so he ended up hopscotching to Céline, when Phoebe Philo was creative director, to work on the more commercial precollections and, from there, to Calvin Klein, where he teamed up with Mr. Simons and Mr. Mulier once again.
It was, Mr. Blazy said, like a "high school reunion. It was very romantic. We're going to meet new people, we're going to live in New York."
He and Mr. Mulier rented a weekend place in Connecticut and got a rescue puppy called John John.
But then the Trump election happened, and the Calvin collections became less about the American dream than the American nightmare, somewhat to the dismay of PVH, the conglomerate that owned Calvin Klein. Mr. Simons and his inner circle were fired abruptly after two years.
"It was hell," Mr. Blazy said. "Like when you have your boxes on the street. It's something you see in movies, and then you are the main character."He thought about leaving fashion. Instead he ended up going to Los Angeles to help the artist Sterling Ruby with a collection he showed during the Pitti Uomo trade fair, in Florence.
That's when Daniel Lee, who had been the design director at Céline when Mr. Blazy was there and had just been tasked with updating Bottega Veneta, came calling. And though Mr. Blazy had reportedly gotten fed up with Mr. Lee's erratic leadership and resigned following a show in Detroit (he declined to discuss the situation), when Leo Rongone, the chief executive, was looking for Mr. Lee's replacement, "It was clear we had the right person already here."
The Anti-Pharrell
Mr. Blazy approached Bottega Veneta with two goals: First, to challenge himself to make something that is wearable. "Because we are expensive, it should be an investment," he said. And second, to interact with the world we live in. "Timeless is a word I just cannot hear anymore," he said. "It's more about a responsibility we have as designer to offer something that lasts." But also is not boring.
The first thing he did was reduce the size of the design teams so that everyone could sit around the same table. Then he involved the craftspeople (the leather workers and fabric developers) in every conversation.
"He knows everyone's name," Mr. Rongone said. "He listens to everyone." He brought a "new mood" to the studio, Mr. Pinault said. That's how those leather jeans -- "the first thing I asked for on the first day in the first meeting," he said -- came about.
The first response was "not possible," Mr. Blazy said. Then the teams started going through test after test -- about 30 to 40 of them, he said -- until one day his staff brought him a sample, "and I thought it was cotton," he said. "I'll always remember that day." Those "denim" jeans, which cost $ 6,900, sold out in two weeks, Mr. Blazy said.
Mr. Blazy believes in products that serve a function, like the Andiamo bag, a practical intrecciato style that Mr. Rongone said has become Bottega's best-selling item, and products that are unique, like a "sardine bag" from the last collection that comes with a Murano glass handle shaped like a Brancusi fish. No two handles are exactly alike (though there is a more accessible brass version). Twenty-five such bags were produced, costing $ 11,000 each, of which Bergdorf got three -- "and they sold immediately," Ms. Fargo said. At this stage, said Mr. Pinault, Bottega is close to becoming the third largest brand in the group, just after Gucci and Saint Laurent, and vying with Balenciaga.
"Even their most commercial pieces are special," Ms. Fargo said. "We're all in on it."
Mr. Blazy recently got his own apartment in Milan, after surfing a series of Airbnbs. (Mr. Mulier, now the creative director of Alaïa, and Mr. Blazy split up earlier this year; they are friends and share custody of the dog, though the breakup is still too hard for him to talk about.) The apartment, at the top of a 1960s Modernist building, looks a bit like a houseboat inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright: dark wood, slanted ceilings, with a step up on one side to a tiny balcony that is covered in greenery.
"I walked in and thought, 'This looks familiar,"' Mr. Blazy said. It turned out he was renting the same apartment Mr. Simons had rented for a time during a stint as creative director of Jil Sander from 2005 to 2012.
He shares the flat during the week with Mr. Debusschere. They have music planning meetings in the kitchen late at night over drinks, and more corporate meetings in the morning, looking over the roofs of Milan and drinking coffee. Mr. Blazy often brings art from his house to his office, and vice versa. He shot the most recent Bottega ad campaign in the courtyard of the apartment, featuring Mariacarla Boscono and his very stoic looking doorman.
Lately he has been thinking a lot about nature. "I'm interested in fish," he said to his team. "Can we look at birds? I saw this woman in the street. She was walking with double shorts. I think it's interesting. Can we try? Maybe it's too perfect. Can we try to make it less perfect?" And so on.
When they are in the studio, he said, he asks his team, "Would you wear this?" Sometimes they say no. Then, he asks them, "Why did you design it?"
Last season he began styling his shows himself, which he will do again this season. "I would rather make my own mistakes," he said.
He is glad he took his time in stepping forward. "Because now, even if I doubt, I know a question mark can become not just 'I don't know,"' he said. "It can become an adventure."

Four years later, however, and still in his 20s, Blazy jumped to the Margiela Artisanal collection, that brand’s equivalent of couture. That’s where he began to experiment with the idea of transformation; using one kind of material (plastic hair combs) to represent another (fringe).
“I could really use my passion digging, being curious,” he said. But, he said, he was worried he would be pigeonholed as a conceptualist, so he ended up hopscotching to Céline, when Phoebe Philo was creative director, to work on the more commercial precollections and, from there, to Calvin Klein, where he teamed up with Simons and Mulier once again.
It was, Blazy said, like a “high school reunion. It was very romantic. We’re going to meet new people, we’re going to live in New York.”
He and Mulier rented a weekend place in Connecticut and got a rescue puppy called John John.
But then the Trump election happened, and the Calvin collections became less about the American dream than the American nightmare, somewhat to the dismay of PVH, the conglomerate that owned Calvin Klein. Simons and his inner circle were fired abruptly after two years.
“It was hell,” Blazy said. “Like when you have your boxes on the street. It’s something you see in movies, and then you are the main character.” He thought about leaving fashion. Instead he ended up going to Los Angeles to help artist Sterling Ruby with a collection he showed during the Pitti Uomo trade fair, in Florence, Italy.
That’s when Lee, who had been the design director at Céline when Blazy was there and had just been tasked with updating Bottega Veneta, came calling. And though Blazy had reportedly gotten fed up with Lee’s erratic leadership and resigned following a show in Detroit (he declined to discuss the situation), when Leo Rongone, the CEO, was looking for Lee’s replacement, “it was clear we had the right person already here.”
The Anti-Pharrell
Blazy approached Bottega Veneta with two goals: First, to challenge himself to make something that is wearable. “Because we are expensive, it should be an investment,” he said. And second, to interact with the world we live in. “Timeless is a word I just cannot hear anymore,” he said. “It’s more about a responsibility we have as designer to offer something that lasts.” But also is not boring.
The first thing he did was reduce the size of the design teams so that everyone could sit around the same table. Then he involved the craftspeople (the leather workers and fabric developers) in every conversation.
“He knows everyone’s name,” Rongone said. “He listens to everyone.” He brought a “new mood” to the studio, Pinault said. That’s how those leather jeans — “the first thing I asked for on the first day in the first meeting,” he said — came about.
The first response was “not possible,” Blazy said. Then the teams started going through test after test — about 30 to 40 of them, he said — until one day his staff brought him a sample, “and I thought it was cotton,” he said. “I’ll always remember that day.” Those “denim” jeans, which cost $6,900, sold out in two weeks, Blazy said.
Blazy believes in products that serve a function, like the Andiamo bag, a practical intrecciato style that Rongone said has become Bottega’s bestselling item, and products that are unique, like a “sardine bag” from the last collection that comes with a Murano glass handle shaped like a Brancusi fish. No two handles are exactly alike (though there is a more accessible brass version). Twenty-five such bags were produced, costing $11,000 each, of which Bergdorf got three — “and they sold immediately,” Fargo said. At this stage, said Pinault, Bottega is close to becoming the third largest brand in the group, just after Gucci and Saint Laurent, and vying with Balenciaga.
“Even their most commercial pieces are special,” Fargo said. “We’re all in on it.”
Blazy recently got his own apartment in Milan, after surfing a series of Airbnbs. (Mulier, now the creative director of Alaïa, and Blazy split up earlier this year; they are friends and share custody of the dog, though the breakup is still too hard for him to talk about.) The apartment, at the top of a 1960s Modernist building, looks a bit like a houseboat inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright: dark wood, slanted ceilings, with a step up on one side to a tiny balcony that is covered in greenery.
“I walked in and thought, ‘This looks familiar,’” Blazy said. It turned out he was renting the same apartment Simons had rented for a time during a stint as creative director of Jil Sander from 2005 to 2012.
He shares the flat during the week with Debusschere. They have music planning meetings in the kitchen late at night over drinks, and more corporate meetings in the morning, looking over the roofs of Milan and drinking coffee. Blazy often brings art from his house to his office, and vice versa. He shot the most recent Bottega ad campaign in the courtyard of the apartment, featuring Mariacarla Boscono and his very stoic looking door attendant.
Lately he has been thinking a lot about nature. “I’m interested in fish,” he said to his team. “Can we look at birds? I saw this woman in the street. She was walking with double shorts. I think it’s interesting. Can we try? Maybe it’s too perfect. Can we try to make it less perfect?” And so on.
When they are in the studio, Blazy said, he asks his team, “Would you wear this?” Sometimes they say no. Then, he asks them, “Why did you design it?”
Last season he began styling his shows himself, which he will do again this season. “I would rather make my own mistakes,” he said.
He is glad he took his time in stepping forward. “Because now, even if I doubt, I know a question mark can become not just ‘I don’t know,’” he said. “It can become an adventure.”

Full text: After comfort clothing, after confusion, clarity comes to New York Fashion Week.
Ever since the Covid-19 lockdowns lifted in 2021, when people began to emerge from social isolation and the fashion system started to work again, we've been asking the same question: What do we wear? The world was different; we were different. Staring into your closet was like staring into a foreign land.
First, the answer was continuity: comfort clothes, elastic waists, sneakers, leggings. Then there were predictions that the Roaring '20s would return in all their glittering, befeathered glamour. Then that started to seem premature, because ... well, the war in Ukraine. And it turned out that Covid wasn't exactly over. Then everyone threw up their hands and said, "It's a mess!"
So was fashion, and that's pretty much where things stood.
But as the New York shows drew to a close this week, a different answer emerged: a hybrid look for a hybrid world. A style that isn't armored or swaddled, decorative or in denial, but instead connects pragmatism to polish, building a bridge that is also enabling. In a good way. Imagine a world where you could have your structure and freedom too.
It's one where the sleeves of a no-nonsense suit jacket might be sliced open (free the forearm!), and the jacket then worn over an elaborately ruched jersey minidress, like a little amethyst cloud, as at Tory Burch -- who has finally fully escaped her dependence on Lee Radziwill to lead the way (fast, in flat shoes and maybe that dress with flying saucer hems) toward whatever is coming next.
A Trend Takes Flight
"It was time for a new direction," Joseph Altuzarra said before a show that traded his usual executive shibori silhouette for one that had come slightly undone. Sheer slip skirts came pre-crinkled via metallic thread, bra tops peeked out from under trapeze coats, and cotton dresses slipped off the shoulders to show the straps beneath. The idea was right, but his new direction looked a lot like Prada's old direction, which was a problem.
Michael Kors said it a different way: "No one needs more tight melton pencil skirts." Hard to argue with that. Instead he offered a collection that was heavy on the light -- Empire-waist dresses with leotard tops and airy skirts caught with tough leather belts at the breast; Jane Birkin-era lace caftans -- without being flimsy. In fact, "light" might have been the mantra of the week. Brandon Maxwell ended his show with an elegant black gown caught up on one shoulder with a metallic knot, the skirt featuring a dove in midflight.
At Gabriela Hearst, there was lightness in the chiffon inserts hidden between the pleats of an otherwise no-nonsense cotton trench and in the tiny glass beads handwoven into a crocheted fishnet dress. Lightness at Carolina Herrera, in a straight sequined skirt sliced up the back and paired with a black shirt, and in a lemon yellow skirt constructed from four layers of tulle but no crinolines.
"I found myself at fittings taking off a ruffle or eliminating a seam," Wes Gordon, the creative director of Herrera, said before the show, the goal being what he called "minimalism with soul" (minimalism being a relative term in the Herrera world). Which is a fairly good explanation of where this may be going and why it's appealing. Also, perhaps, why there are so many echoes of the '90s around, like sonar pings from a distant land.
Then There Was Mud
"Soul" is one of those terms that can sound hokey when it comes to clothing -- clothes do not have souls, duh -- but actually means the way garments can serve as wormholes to memories that are the building blocks of a life, so wearing them becomes a choice filled with meaning.
That's what makes Raul Lopez's work at Luar -- a chaotic mix of raised-shoulder tension, suits rent open at the thighs and after-dark slink caught between communities -- so resonant. It's what powers the patched-together mix of shredded denim and sequins, lace and frayed suiting of Ev Bravado and Tela D'Amore at Who Decides War. And it's what complicates the narrative at Elena Velez, who set up a mud pit in Brooklyn the better to illustrate a didactic manifesto about "antiheroines" and the need for "resistance to a monolithic cultural paradigm."
That translated into a primal scream of a collection in rough-cut toiles, so the seams of a trench and a corseted minidress bristled outward, as if the clothes themselves were raising their hackles. (Ms. Velez has been yelling into the void for a while now, sometimes about the hands that would feed her.) At the end the show predictably deteriorated into a wrestling match, dragging everyone down into the swamp. It wasn't necessary. Nor was the silly proclamation.
Ms. Velez's point had already been made as effectively as possible by a single accessory: a stiletto shoe, the spike heel jammed into the sole of a Nike slide (Nike having sponsored the show), forcing the woman who wore it to watch each step she took, casting her progression in terror.
Yet under all the mud, progress was there. So was a really great bomber jacket.
The Best Show in New York
Still, no designer did more to crystallize the way forward than Willy Chavarria, whose genderless suiting deserves to redefine New York fashion. It doesn't just break boundaries between cultural traditions, the street and the skyscraper, and old stereotypes of who can wear what when. It erases them completely.
See jackets with sharp shoulders and widened, jutting lapels; waists nipped in by a single button and paired with pleated trousers cut like the swishiest skirt; see sweeping overcoats adorned with an explosive crimson rose. See tuxedos where the culottes are actually basketball shorts; choirboy collars as stiff and soaring as those of a high court judge; hammered bronze and silver sequins matched with sweats or T-shirts; and the most dramatic taffeta opera cloaks over ratty old tighty whities.
The result is both a grand gesture and an easy one. A sweatshirt came with the slogan "Grupo Nuevo Vision por Vida," or "New Group Vision for Life." Mr. Chavarria actually offered one. At this point, who doesn't need that?

Full text: The fashion world came out to honor the star photographer. He didn't show.
At a cocktail party in Lower Manhattan on Friday to celebrate a new collection of clothing and accessories designed by the fashion photographer Steven Meisel for Zara, practically the only boldface name who didn't show up was Steven Meisel.
"I would have been surprised if he had come," said Edward Enninful, the editor in chief of British Vogue, standing outside the event space on Howard Street as the model Kaia Gerber walked by. "He's shy. He lets the work speak for itself."
If Mr. Meisel were a movie star, said another guest, the writer James Reginato, he'd be Greta Garbo.
Mr. Meisel's photo spreads are known for their inventive and often satirical narratives. In "Makeover Madness," a 2005 feature for Italian Vogue, Linda Evangelista posed as a couture-clad socialite with a plastic surgery addiction.
Ms. Evangelista was one of many models at the party, along with a number of editors, stylists and other fashion-world people who have worked with Mr. Meisel.
He seems to be having a moment. In addition to the Zara collaboration, Phaidon is publishing a book this month, "Linda Evangelista Photographed by Steven Meisel." On Oct. 6, Christie's is holding an auction titled "Madonna x Meisel -- the Sex Photographs" of more than 40 photos from Madonna's 1992 coffee table book, "Sex."
Mr. Meisel, who shot the cover for Madonna's 1984 album, "Like a Virgin," was her chief collaborator for "Sex." She has credited him with teaching her to treat each photo shoot as "a small film" and to transform in each into a new character. "He was the first person to introduce me to the idea of reinvention," Madonna once said in an interview with Vogue.
Several models at the party spoke of how Mr. Meisel had either found signature looks for them or changed their appearances in ways they had not imagined.
Karen Elson, who made her name with a goth princess look, was decked out in a black trench coat that Mr. Meisel had designed for Zara. She said that when she met Mr. Meisel in 1996, she was "a mousy strawberry blond." On their second shoot together, for Italian Vogue, Mr. Meisel tried something new.
"They shaved my eyebrows off and colored my hair red," Ms. Elson said. "It was the first time I saw myself, if that makes sense. Steven has this uncanny ability to make his subjects feel seen. It was like I had been transformed into who I am, and that's something magical he possesses. They call him a Svengali for a reason."
The model Joan Smalls recalled working with Mr. Meisel on a Moschino ad campaign in which he spoofed a TV series from the '80s where "all the women hate each other."
If only she could remember the name of the show.
"'Dynasty'?" a reporter asked.
"Yes, that's it. Exactly," she said. "It was just so much fun."
Mr. Meisel long ago stopped going to events where he might be photographed. But everyone in fashion knows his look: androgynous, with long black hair and all black clothes, with a punk edge. His designs for Zara were of a piece with that. "It's his uniform," the model Karolina Kurkova said as she picked out a black leather biker cap from the racks.
A few feet away, the hairstylist Julien d'Ys was trying on a faux-fur winter hat that suggested a mash-up of Dr. Zhivago and Rick Owens. Mr. d'Ys described how Mr. Meisel had brought him to New York in the early '80s to meet the designer Stephen Sprouse.
Mr. Sprouse and Mr. Meisel had worked together in the '70s, under the designer Halston. Mr. Sprouse, who died in 2004, was the studio manager. Mr. Meisel, a gifted illustrator, was responsible for providing the Halston seamstresses with drawings that served as blueprints. But he did not get along with the boss, who derisively nicknamed him "Pocahontas," Mr. Meisel told Vogue in a rare interview in 2009.
After some time at Women's Wear Daily, Mr. Meisel was brought to Condé Nast by its editorial director, Alexander Liberman, and began shooting for many of its publications. Prada, Calvin Klein, Louis Vuitton and Versace started calling on him for ad campaigns. In those days, Mr. Meisel went everywhere -- Mudd Club, Area, Marc Jacobs shows. The reclusive part, Mr. d'Ys said, came later.
In 2009, when the International Center of Photography staged an exhibition featuring Mr. Meisel's work, the Vogue editor Anna Wintour assigned a profile of Mr. Meisel. The result was an article suggesting that a possible reason for his reclusiveness was insecurity about his weight.
After that, Mr. Meisel shot for American Vogue only sporadically. Asked about the apparent deterioration of the magazine's relationship with Mr. Meisel, Ms. Wintour said in an email, "Steven is an absolutely brilliant photographer, someone whose work defines our era and Vogue's history, and I admire him so much."
At a little past 6 p.m., Tonne Goodman, a former fashion director at Vogue, made a beeline to Ms. Evangelista, who was decked out in a black oversize Meisel for Zara blazer along with her own billowing black skirt and a pair of Meisel-designed biker boots.
"Aren't they great?" she said.
Mr. d'Ys gave Ms. Evangelista a kiss hello, which turned into a long embrace.
"He gave me my original haircut!" Ms. Evangelista said, recalling a shoot from early in her career, when Mr. Meisel was behind the camera and Mr. d'Ys styled her hair. "He's the one who made me cry."
As Ms. Evangelista told it, she wasn't prepared at the beginning to change her look so drastically. But that's what it was like working with Mr. Meisel.
A reporter asked her why he appeared to be having a resurgence.
"But is it a resurgence?" Ms. Evangelista said. "I don't know. I think he's done a few things all at the same time, and there is this younger generation that's coming to appreciate him now and discover him, I guess."
"He's legendary," she continued. "We all go into our quieter moments and then resurface. It's not like he ever went away. Not like me."

It's Military-Grade Style: [Style Desk]

Full text: The American defense contractor, best known as the world's largest arms dealer, is getting into the streetwear business.
If you've spent any time in the military, or around people who have, you've likely encountered the merch often given out free at workplace gatherings or sold at convention centers during air and sea expos. Major defense contractors like Raytheon, Boeing and Northrop-Grumman have produced baseball hats, T-shirts and water bottles advertising military-grade weapons like ballistic missiles, rocket-propelled grenades and fighter jets.
Now, Lockheed Martin, the American defense contractor best known as the world's largest weapons manufacturer, is allowing its brand to be used in the streetwear business.
Through Equity Management Inc, a corporate trademark licensing company in San Diego, Lockheed has been selling its trademark to apparel retailers in both the United States and abroad. A spokesperson for Lockheed Martin confirmed the collaborations were real but declined to comment further.
Doojin Corporation, in Seoul, recently bought the rights to use Lockheed Martin's brand name, and since May has released several streetwear collections featuring oversize cargo pants and hoodies, logo graphic tees with slogans like "Ensuring those we serve always stay ahead of ready," and other T-shirts displaying the brand's fighter jets. The pieces range from $ 30 for a T-shirt to $ 115 for a nylon zip-up jacket, and are aimed at young consumers of South Korea's growing streetwear market, where oversize cuts and bucket hats reign supreme.
Doojin's Lockheed Martin collection harks back to the 2019 gorpcore moment, when outdoor sports infiltrated the season's biggest trends, including a Louis Vuitton chalk bag for rock climbing, or Prada's multi-buckled and strapped performance parkas, perfect for any influencer wanting to scale Mount Everest.
But the Lockheed Martin streetwear line takes the idea of functional-clothing-as-fashion a step further, creating pieces that don't just look like they belong at base camp, but also on an army base.
It's all part of a larger trend in South Korea that started around 2020 called K-licensed Brands, said Young Chul Kim, a street style and fashion photographer in Seoul. "Brand names such as National Geographic, Jeep, Kodak, NASA, Life, M.L.B., etc. are in the Seoul fashion scene, and are very popular for young people," he wrote in an email.
National Geographic, for example, has seen such success licensing its brand for apparel in South Korea that the trademark's licenser, the Nature Holdings, recently expanded into China.
Sukwoo Hong, a Korean fashion journalist and director of the Navy Lab creative studio, said the Lockheed Martin collaboration "reflects a very 'nowadays' Korean streetwear feel," and likened it to the recent collaboration between the Metropolitan Museum of Art and PacSun.
"The logos of 'non-fashion' brands are actually quite popular in Korea," Mr. Hong said.
Brands like National Geographic and CNN also have the advantage of already being known entities, Mr. Hong said; it's easier for Korean companies to license famous brands for collections than it is to try to create new ones.
"In fact, this collaboration with 'logos' or 'non-fashion brands' has been a trend in Korea for a while now," Mr. Hong said. "A few years ago, when the boom around 'retro culture' started, brands from paint companies to food companies collaborated with fashion brands to launch small collections. I think people find the intersection of completely different worlds refreshingly interesting."
Lockheed Martin apparel did not go unnoticed by the young men's style council of TikTok, a set of young fashion critics who use the app to keep their followers updated on men's wear trends. "They stopped killing people for just a second to help you kill those looks," quipped one of the critics, who goes by the name Opal. He captioned his video: "Garms dealers."
Opal praised the cargo pants and jackets but said the logo tees were a little too "on the nose" for his taste. "Sadly, it's only available in Korea right now, so if you're in the U.S., only their tanks and missiles are available to you," he deadpanned on his TikTok.
"The people who made the decision are either so out of touch or like unbelievably acutely aware of what's going on, and I can't really tell the difference," he said in an interview.
You can get Lockheed Martin-branded apparel in the states, but it won't have the same stylish cut or design. American manufacturers of promotional products, like Brand Junkie, in Cypress, Texas, also work with Lockheed Martin to "create unique products and sustain fulfillment programs and e-stores," according to the Brand Junkie website.
On LockheedMartinGear.com, you can buy graphic tees, backpacks and bluetooth speakers advertising your favorite "program," like the F-35 fighter jet, or Skunk Works, the popular nickname for Lockheed Martin's Advanced Development Program that is primarily responsible for classified research and development.
The designs and types of products offered by Brand Junkie suggest the company seems to be marketing to a totally different audience than Doojin's Lockheed Martin Apparel, which is focused primarily on the fashion set. Doojin has been paying street style influencers to pose in its products, including Jonathan Vine, an influencer in Britain, to help increase its fashion credibility.
As for the Lockheed Martin Apparel line, both Mr. Hong and Mr. Kim said they themselves wouldn't be buying any items, but that it's definitely a trend in Seoul. "Personally, I don't think I'd wear it," Mr. Hong said. "But Lockheed Martin has a pretty big presence, even among people who aren't necessarily interested in the military."

Full text: The Afro-Brazilian artist Emanoel Araújo is considered a giant in his home country. A museum he founded is working to preserve his legacy.
The day Emanoel Araújo died last year, his museum was in shambles.
It was Sept. 7, the 200th anniversary of Brazil's independence, and renovations at the Museu Afro Brasil had just begun the month before.
An artist known as much for his geometric sculptures and reliefs as for his tenacity and penchant for getting what he wanted, Araújo (pronounced Ahra-OO-zhoh) was just two months shy of his 82nd birthday at the time of his death -- 18 years after he founded the museum and later fought for state funding for much-needed updates.
Even as floors were being torn up and walls taken down, Araújo was adamant that the Museu Afro Brasil -- which bears his name on the building and which he considered his most important work -- not shutter completely, leaving the long-term exhibitions open to the public.
Although he is not well known in many parts of the world, Araújo is a household name in Brazil's art world. He spent his life trying to create much-needed exhibition spaces for underrecognized Afro-Brazilian artists -- this in a country with a population that is majority Black -- and it pained him to think that the doors of the museum, in São Paulo's Ibirapuera Park, would be closed.
"We already had to shut down for eight months in 2020 because of the pandemic, and Emanoel was so distressed about it, so worried," Sandra Salles, executive director of the Museu Afro Brasil, said in a recent interview. "He refused to work from home. We laughed because even when the park was closed and we couldn't physically get to the museum, he wanted to go in to work."
So when Araújo died, there was no need to discuss where his funeral would be held. Friends and colleagues got together and started clearing out the gallery next to the museum's ground-floor entrance. At the center of the high-ceilinged room, its stark-white walls bare save for two of Araújo's reliefs, they placed one of the artist's best-known pieces, "Baobá."
The sculpture, an imposing vertical figure with sharp angles carved in wood and painted black, is named after a tree sacred to the West African Yoruba people. It represents the connection between the physical and spiritual worlds and is considered a witness to time and a guardian of memory. It's also a fitting symbol for a man who spent his life trying to preserve the history and culture of Afro-Brazilians through its artists.
"He used to say, 'If I don't remember them, remember their story, nobody will,"' Salles said. "'This country has no memory. They'll think this all fell from the sky."'
Now the spotlight is being turned back on Araújo's work: His first solo exhibition in the United States will be at Jack Shainman Gallery, in New York, which also represents his estate. The show, opening Sept. 12, will highlight pieces the artist created throughout his career, from the 1970s to 2022, in various mediums, including wood, metal and found objects.
"He spent so much of his life supporting other artists," the gallery's co-founder, Jack Shainman, said. "In a way, he was hiding in plain sight. And his concerns, his intentions, his work really parallels so many of the artists I work with already that adding his voice feels almost like it's part of a chorus."
Much of Araújo's personal collection of pieces from African and Afro-Brazilian artists -- which number in the thousands and are spread out across his homes and the Museu Afro Brasil -- will also be put up for auction later this year in São Paulo, with hopes that they will continue to be available for public viewing.
Born into a family of goldsmiths in the town of Santo Amaro da Purificação in Brazil's northeastern state of Bahia, Araújo learned to work with wood in the studio of a master woodcarver, Eufrásio Vargas. At 13, he took a job as a graphic designer for his hometown's Official Press, a company that prints government communications and announcements.
Six years later, certain that he was on the right path as an artist, he held his first solo exhibition. He soon moved to the state capital, Salvador, where he studied printmaking at the Escola de Belas Artes da Bahia. He would go on to show his work in some 50 solo shows and more than 150 group exhibitions, winning several awards along the way, including a gold medal at the 1972 Graphic Biennial in Florence.
After a stint as director of the Museu de Arte da Bahia in the early 1980s, Araújo headed to New York, where he taught courses in graphic arts and sculpture at City College. Back in Brazil, he spent a decade as the director of São Paulo's Pinacoteca, one of the country's most important art museums, before founding the Museu Afro Brasil in 2004.
An avid collector, he filled the museum's immense galleries with art he'd accumulated over the years: a mix of works touching on the themes of labor, farming and slavery. All tell the story of the journey Africans took when they were forcibly brought to Brazil and of the resilience they needed to rebuild their communities and hold on to their cultures.
When Araújo liked an artist, he made it his mission to buy every piece of theirs he could find. He was passionate about collecting and exhibiting the works of little-known Black artists, like the brothers João and Arthur Timótheo da Costa, who worked together at Brazil's mint, designing stamps and prints before turning their focus to painting in the early 1900s.
But while Araújo had been winning praise for supporting certain artists, he was criticized for not including others.
"Anyone with a critical eye can see there are few women artists represented in the museum," said Amanda Carneiro, a curator and an artistic organizer for the 2024 Venice Biennial who used to work alongside Araújo as a coordination assistant at the Museu Afro Brasil's education center. "Everything has its limits. The Museu Afro Brasil is wonderful, but when something stands alone, it ends up carrying more weight and not being plural enough in its representation of diversity."
That's something that Salles thinks Araújo was trying to change in the months before his death. The last two exhibitions that Araújo oversaw were "Multiple Female Voices," showcasing 86 works from 28 female artists.
While Araújo's fondness for accumulating as many works by a single artist as possible may have seemed excessive, it also pointed to his generosity. He gave countless pieces from his personal collection to the Museu Afro Brasil -- about 2,000 works in the museum's 9,000-piece collection are on loan from him -- and made donations to several other art institutes, including the Pinacoteca.
"He made a big difference, he still makes a big difference," says Keyna Eleison, curator and a former artistic director of Rio de Janeiro's Museum of Modern Art. "We need to keep talking about Emanoel. He needs to be referenced. We need to make him a household name."
Araújo spent little time in the office tucked away in a corner of the museum and rarely sat, but when he did, it was at the desk of his secretary of more than 30 years, Maria de Fátima Pádua, so they could discuss the day's tasks. A demanding boss who also loved to joke around, he could generally be found flitting around the museum in one of his signature hats and designer shoes -- Burberry and Prada were his favorites -- with his dogs, Joca and Tim, by his side.
For Araújo, some of the longtime staffers were like family. His secretary now cares for his dogs, their yellow and white ceramic bowls still on the shelf in his office. Next to them sits a framed photo of a chubby, smiling baby, the son of another museum employee and Araújo's godson and namesake.
For the people who worked closest with him, he was like family, too.
"He might be gone, but the museum will never be without him," Salles said. "All of this will always have come from him."

Cowboys Are Back in the Saddle Again: [Style Desk]

Full text: When Navied Mahdavian, a cartoonist, and his wife, Emelie, a filmmaker, moved from San Francisco to Mackay, Idaho (population 473), they fixated on their new hometown's theater. Or, rather, the ghost of a theater.
A red and white marquee for the Mackay Main Theater dominated part of Main Street, and Mr. and Ms. Mahdavian, who had moved in pursuit of a cheaper and less frantic way of life, resolved with other community members to reopen the cinema, which had been defunct for years.
Before the big reopening, one longtime town resident seemed less than enthusiastic about the plan, Mr. Mahdavian recalled, accusing the theater boosters of trying to import an "artsy-fartsy, social-justice-warrior" sensibility to the Idaho mountains.
"We're actually showing a western," Mr. Mahdavian said.
To which the resident replied: "John Wayne?"
Instead, the Mahdavians chose "Damsel," a new-age western from 2018 featuring a heroine played by Mia Wasikowska, a wimpy male character and a masturbation scene. It didn't go over all that well.
"We probably should've anticipated that the reaction in town would be mixed," said Mr. Mahdavian, 38, who has chronicled his move to a rural area in the forthcoming book "This Country."
By taking an active interest in the West of the American imagination -- and the ever-evolving notions about what a western story can, or should, be -- the Mahdavians are part of a larger movement.
Cowboys ride in and out of popular culture every few years, propelled by a hunger for stories that are wild, tumultuous and unvarnished. Now, as western style spreads across fashion and entertainment once more, that spirit of reinvention is being applied to reinvent the western itself, inflecting an old genre with new viewpoints.
Two cultural stars of the summer, Beyoncé and Barbie, have invoked western tropes. Beyoncé wore a disco cowboy hat tilted over her face and sat atop a silver horse in portraits promoting her Renaissance World Tour, the imagery reminiscent of an extraterrestrial cowgirl. Re-creations of the hat, for fans trying to mimic the look, have sold for over $ 100 on Etsy. "Barbie," which has climbed to more than $ 1 billion at the box office, included a lengthy sequence of Margot Robbie venturing deep into the Wild West of Los Angeles while wearing a white cowboy hat, a pink bandanna and a western-cut pink ensemble. And Taylor Swift may no longer wear western gear in public, as she did early in her career, but there were plenty of cowboy boots and cowboy hats to be seen among her fans headed to the Eras Tour shows this summer.
History rhymes, fusty fashions turn trendy and cult classics become newly beloved -- so it's no surprise that cowboys keep cycling back into the popular imagination.
"There's a longstanding tradition in American history of looking West," said Andrew Patrick Nelson, a historian of American cinema and culture at University of Utah. "Part of the appeal is the idea you can live a more authentic, exciting and rugged life."
Coming out of a period of pandemic malaise, millions of people have gone that-a-way -- in their clothing choices, social media posts, and selections of TV shows and movies. In fashion, high-end brands, including Prada, unveiled spring collections comprising get-ups that smacked of the Old West. On TikTok, thousands of women have posted videos of themselves modeling outfits billed as "coastal cowgirl" -- linen shirts, boots, hats and well-worn denim shorts. The #CoastalCowgirl hashtag has racked up tens of thousands of views.
"Glam western is probably the No. 1 trending thing in fashion right now," said Taylor Johnson, 36, who owns the concert wear boutique Hazel & Olive.
Brunello Cucinelli, the fashion designer, said the "ease and sportiness" of western style lent itself to perennial cycles of popularity. "As a younger man, I watched many Sergio Leone movies and listened to Johnny Cash," Mr. Cucinelli said in an email interview. "While visiting America for the first time, I remember vividly my trips to Texas and how men dressed with their tapered jackets and those great belts with large buckles."
"Yellowstone," the soapy "red state" rancher television series, was ranked by Nielsen as the top scripted program last year. In interviews, several TikTok users said their #CoastalCowgirl posts represented their efforts to mimic Beth Dutton, the ruthless main daughter of the show played by Kelly Reilly.
Kimberly Johnson, 39, a stay-at-home mother in Delaware, said the series offered a reprieve from the Covid-era divorce drama of her own life. When she saw the #CoastalCowgirl trend, she said the thought that crossed her mind was: "Now I have an excuse to dress like I'm from 'Yellowstone'!"
"Yellowstone," which is filmed and based in Montana, pumped some $ 700 million in tourism spending into the state's economy, on top of $ 72 million in production spending from Paramount, according to a study from the University of Montana (which was sponsored by the Media Coalition of Montana and Paramount). Nearly 20 percent of visitors to the state in 2021 attributed their travel in part to watching the series, in what economists called "'Yellowstone'-induced" tourism.
Jordan Calhoun, a writer in New York who edits the how-to site Lifehacker, was one of the fans who went West because of the show. He said his affection for the series came about in the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, when he was locked down in his Harlem apartment and felt the need for a landscape that looked different from what he was seeing out his window. He longed for rows of pines, big stretches of sky. And he wanted to experience the Dutton family's way of life.
"I don't know how to fix a fence or ride a horse or grow crops," Mr. Calhoun, 38, said. "Self-reliance, or country living, is something that got really appealing during the pandemic."
He spent five days on a Colorado ranch in 2022. Although the trip confirmed for him that it wasn't what he wanted full time, it taught Mr. Calhoun, who is Black, that the western landscapes he loved on TV were something he could go and enjoy. That was a realization far afield from what he had felt watching westerns when he was growing up.
"I watched 'Young Guns' a thousand times," he said. "There wasn't much of me in it."
But as much as it is a place on the map, the West is also an idea, one that changes over time. And amid the latest round of fascination with cowboy culture, the western, a staple film genre since the early days of cinema, is being reimagined for a growing audience.
From 2000 to 2009, Hollywood made 23 movies categorized as westerns, according to Comscore, which compiles box office data. That number shot up to 42 from 2010 to 2019. Some of these new films feature Black cowboys, Native American protagonists, queer heroes and damsels far from distress. Some are directed by female filmmakers, like Jane Campion, whose 2021 movie "The Power of the Dog," which features a most likely closeted rancher, received more Academy Award nominations than any other film last year.
Alaina Roberts, an American historian who wrote "I've Been Here All the While: Black Freedom on Native Land," was raised with all the classic images of what a western film looked like: Davy Crockett wrestling a bear, John Wayne squinting through the Texas dust. Her mother loved those films.
But when Dr. Roberts started her own career as a scholar, those weren't the visions of the West that captured her imagination. Instead, she wanted to research stories of her own Black family members, who were enslaved by the Chickasaw and Choctaw tribes in what is now Ardmore, Okla. She also grew fascinated by the Buffalo Soldiers, all-Black regiments who policed the plains.
"We shouldn't be afraid of complexity," said Ms. Roberts, 32, who consulted on the recent documentary series "The Real Wild West," which focuses on Black and Hispanic cowboys, Buffalo Soldiers, Native leaders and women on the plains. "It doesn't mean we're trying to rewrite history."
The list of movies, TV shows and documentaries taking on these more tangled western tales keeps growing. There's "The Harder They Fall," a 2021 film from the director Jeymes Samuel about Black outlaws, sharpshooters, horse riders and frontier townspeople. The director Kelly Reichardt has put her stamp on the genre in two films: "Meek's Cutoff," which is centered on pioneer women played by Michelle Williams, Shirley Henderson and Zoe Kazan, who realize that a Native American man they meet on the Oregon Trail is more trustworthy than their white guide; and "First Cow," about a pair of misfits, played by Orion Lee and John Magaro, trying to make a go of it in mid-19th-century Oregon. There's also Chloé Zhao's "The Rider," a rodeo story about the Lakota Sioux tribe.
Ms. Mahdavian, 41, who moved with her husband from San Francisco to rural Idaho, is another filmmaker who has trained her camera on the West. Her 2022 documentary, "Bitterbrush," follows female cattle ranchers near her new home. "I don't have an agenda to kill the western," she said. "I find myself drawn to telling stories that feel true to a certain type of lived experience."
Western films have tended to reflect the experience of the people who produced them and the ideas in the air at the time of their production, film historians say. The westerns of the World War II era, for example, fulfilled a hunger for clear-cut messages. Some see "Stagecoach," the 1939 John Wayne classic, as a parable for the New Deal: A group of Americans (a whiskey salesman, a drunken doctor) have to work together to prevail over what's lurking around them.
Then came the 1960s, when social changes raised questions about the old order, driving a desire for new types of anti-establishment western heroes, like Clint Eastwood's antihero "Man With No Name" character, or the jovial outlaws played by Paul Newman and Robert Redford in "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."
"It's almost like a Rorschach inkblot test," Richard Aquila, 76, a historian and author of "The Sagebrush Trail" said. "Every generation is going to interpret differently what it sees in the West."
For die-hard lovers of western films and novels, the periodic resurgence of the genre is invigorating because it sends new fans toward old classics. W.F. Strong, a professor of communications and culture at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, delights in hearing from young readers who have recently discovered Larry McMurtry's 1985 novel "Lonesome Dove," which follows a group of lovably bone-headed cowpokes from their tiny hometown, Lonesome Dove, to the plains of Montana.
Mr. Strong, 68, said he particularly loved how Mr. McMurtry, who died in 2021, was able to capture the lives of ordinary Americans in the novel. "He was writing about my people -- and I didn't realize you could do that as an author," he recalled. "When I was young, I thought you had to be writing about glamorous things far away, like England."
For many people, including those taking part in the #cowgirl memes on social media, that's part of the appeal -- the idea that the western experience seems within reach, that wide-open plains are closer than they appear. Kyra Smolkin, a content creator in Los Angeles who has been posting her cowgirl-themed fashions on TikTok, said she grew up in Toronto "romanticizing small towns and ranches."
"What's cool about cowgirl style is it's attainable -- there's no barrier to entry," Ms. Smolkin, 30, said. "I love that there's an ease to it. It's easy to make your own."
And for the Mahdavians, the couple who moved from San Francisco to Idaho, there was a thrill to making the western story their own, by setting up a home in the kind of landscape that they had long associated with the movies. They built a house on a small plot of land about a 20-minute drive from Mackay. It is surrounded by snow-capped mountains, and there are no people in sight.
They have also gotten past the mixed reception they received for their opening night at the renovated theater on Main Street. They pulled it off by showing "The Quiet Man," a 1952 western romance starring John Wayne.
"We had, like, 70 people come, which for a population of 500 is a lot," Mr. Mahdavian recalled. "People definitely responded to John Wayne."

Some of these new films feature Black cowboys, Native American protagonists, queer heroes and damsels far from distress. Some are directed by female filmmakers, like Jane Campion, whose 2021 movie “The Power of the Dog,” which features a rancher most likely closeted, received more Academy Award nominations than any other film last year.
Alaina Roberts, an American historian who wrote “I’ve Been Here All the While: Black Freedom on Native Land,” was raised with all the classic images of what a western film looked like: Davy Crockett wrestling a bear, John Wayne squinting through the Texas dust. Her mother loved those films.
But when Roberts started her own career as a scholar, those weren’t the visions of the West that captured her imagination. Instead, she wanted to research stories of her own Black family members, who were enslaved by the Chickasaw and Choctaw tribes in what is now Ardmore, Oklahoma. She also grew fascinated by the Buffalo Soldiers, all-Black regiments that policed the plains.
“We shouldn’t be afraid of complexity,” said Roberts, 32, who consulted on the recent documentary series “The Real Wild West,” which focuses on Black and Hispanic cowboys, Buffalo Soldiers, Native leaders and women on the plains. “It doesn’t mean we’re trying to rewrite history.”
The list of movies, TV shows and documentaries taking on these more tangled Western tales keeps growing. There’s “The Harder They Fall,” a 2021 film from director Jeymes Samuel about Black outlaws, sharpshooters, horse riders and frontier townspeople. Director Kelly Reichardt has put her stamp on the genre in two films: “Meek’s Cutoff,” which is centered on pioneer women played by Michelle Williams, Shirley Henderson and Zoe Kazan, who realize that a Native American man they meet on the Oregon Trail is more trustworthy than their white guide; and “First Cow,” about a pair of misfits, played by Orion Lee and John Magaro, trying to make a go of it in mid-19th-century Oregon. There’s also Chloé Zhao’s “The Rider,” a rodeo story about the Lakota Sioux tribe.
Emelie Mahdavian, 41, who moved with her husband from San Francisco to rural Idaho, is another filmmaker who has trained her camera on the West. Her 2022 documentary, “Bitterbrush,” follows female cattle ranchers near her new home. “I don’t have an agenda to kill the western,” she said. “I find myself drawn to telling stories that feel true to a certain type of lived experience.”
Western films have tended to reflect the experience of the people who produced them and the ideas in the air at the time of their production, film historians say. The westerns of the World War II era, for example, fulfilled a hunger for clear-cut messages. Some see “Stagecoach,” the 1939 John Wayne classic, as a parable for the New Deal: A group of Americans (a whiskey salesman, a drunken doctor) have to work together to prevail over what’s lurking around them.
Then came the 1960s, when social changes raised questions about the old order, driving a desire for new types of anti-establishment western heroes, such as Clint Eastwood’s antihero “Man With No Name” character or the jovial outlaws played by Paul Newman and Robert Redford in “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.”
“It’s almost like a Rorschach inkblot test,” said Richard Aquila, 76, a historian and author of “The Sagebrush Trail.” “Every generation is going to interpret differently what it sees in the West.”
For die-hard lovers of western films and novels, the periodic resurgence of the genre is invigorating because it sends new fans toward old classics. W.F. Strong, a professor of communications and culture at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, delights in hearing from young readers who have recently discovered Larry McMurtry’s 1985 novel “Lonesome Dove,” which follows a group of lovably bone-headed cowpokes from their tiny hometown, Lonesome Dove, to the plains of Montana.
Strong, 68, said he particularly loved how McMurtry, who died in 2021, was able to capture the lives of ordinary Americans in the novel. “He was writing about my people — and I didn’t realize you could do that as an author,” he recalled. “When I was young, I thought you had to be writing about glamorous things far away, like England.”
For many people, including those taking part in the #cowgirl memes on social media, that’s part of the appeal — the idea that the Western experience seems within reach, that wide-open plains are closer than they appear. Kyra Smolkin, a content creator in Los Angeles who has been posting her cowgirl-themed fashions on TikTok, said she grew up in Toronto “romanticizing small towns and ranches.”
“What’s cool about cowgirl style is it’s attainable; there’s no barrier to entry,” Smolkin, 30, said. “I love that there’s an ease to it. It’s easy to make your own.”
And for the Mahdavians, there was a thrill to making the Western story their own, by setting up a home in the kind of landscape they had long associated with the movies. They built a house on a small plot of land about a 20-minute drive from Mackay. It is surrounded by snow-capped mountains, and there are no people in sight.
They have also gotten past the mixed reception they received for their opening night at the renovated theater on Main Street. They pulled it off by showing “The Quiet Man,” a 1952 western romance starring John Wayne.
“We had, like, 70 people come, which for a population of 500 is a lot,” Navied Mahdavian recalled. “People definitely responded to John Wayne.”

A Summer Visit to Aspen on the Cheap: [Travel Desk]

Full text: The Colorado town associated with glitzy ski trips also draws summer visitors who love hiking, biking and cultural festivals. Here's how to craft an affordable vacation in this famously expensive enclave.
Over an $ 8.50 pint of craft beer from Aspen Brewing Company, which is comparable to what I pay at home in Chicago, I realized that Aspen, Colo., is not expensive by big-city standards. It's expensive by small-town standards.
The Economic Research Institute, which compiles financial data for public and private organizations, pegs the cost of living in Aspen at 51 percent higher than the average in the United States, a little less than a city like Seattle.
As a professionally penny-pinching traveler, I try to avoid paying urban prices in the mountains. In the summer in Aspen, apart from my weakness for microbrews, I didn't have to.
For those who don't care to shop for Prada or Gucci clothing, or don't maintain elaborate second mansions here, Aspen's essential appeal lies in the outdoors -- mountains, wildlife, rivers -- which, compared with winter, when you might need to rent ski equipment or pay for mountain access, is a steal. Hiking and city bus transportation are free. Cycling, if you can avoid expensive rentals, is a bargain. Parks beckon picnickers, and free cultural attractions abound.
Over the course of three days in Aspen, I spent about $ 600 before airfare, with most of that on lodging. Here's how I cheaped out in a resort town synonymous with wealth.
Extra beds and free wheels
An annual winter visitor to Aspen, I touched down in July, astonished at how dramatic the mountains looked without fluffy layers of snow to soften their jagged edges.
From the Aspen/Pitkin County Airport, nearly four miles from downtown, the Roaring Fork Transportation Authority buses are free to and around town, saving more than $ 20 on a taxi and delivering the moral satisfaction of speeding by bumper-to-bumper traffic in a bus-only lane.
Within 10 minutes, I reached town and walked a few blocks to my Main Street accommodations at the Tyrolean Lodge, a relatively affordable, family-run hotel decorated in vintage ski gear and backcountry photos that the local Aspen Times once called "a dying breed in Aspen."
"There used to be small lodges all over Aspen owned by families and not corporations," said Pierre Wille, the general manager, whose family has owned the Tyrolean since 1970.
Fifteen of its 16 rooms accommodate five people in three beds, and all have efficiency kitchens with free coffee to help guests economize on meals. I paid $ 267 a night including taxes and fees, which, for budget travelers, is expensive for one person, but a find for families and groups, potentially knocking the price down to $ 53 a night per person. By comparison, rates at the luxury Hotel Jerome were running $ 1,275 a night. Even the more modest Limelight Hotel Aspen was charging over $ 700 a night.
"We're interested in keeping Aspen affordable," Mr. Wille said. "A ski bum can still sort of make it."
A summer bum, I was relieved to find the lodge offered free bikes. The fleet of eight hand-me-downs solidly beat the offerings at local shops, which mostly rent only electric bikes, charging $ 130 a day for e-bike rentals.
I pedaled my single-speed cruiser to the nearby Rio Grande Trail, which runs down the valley following the Roaring Fork River from Aspen 42 miles to Glenwood Springs. I breezed as far as Woody Creek, about eight miles, before turning around for the uphill return, consoling myself with extended wildflower-viewing time as other cyclists whizzed past on e-bikes.
Bus to the wilds
As skiing is to winter, hiking is to summer. Several trails take off from town, and anyone who hikes up Aspen Mountain can take the gondola back down free.
Among the stars of the Elk Mountains that surround Aspen are the "14ers," or 14,000-foot-plus peaks, including Maroon Peak and North Maroon Peak, collectively known as the Maroon Bells, about 10 miles west of town.
One look at the majestic pyramidal pair reflected in Maroon Lake at the base of the Maroon Bells Scenic Area explains why more than 300,000 visitors come here each year. To quell traffic between May and October, RFTA runs a bus ( $ 16 by reservation) to the area from Aspen Highlands, one of the four ski mountains that make up Aspen Snowmass (a free RFTA bus travels between town and Aspen Highlands).
I booked the day's first lightly trafficked shuttle at 7 a.m. on a chilly, bright morning and hit the trail to Crater Lake, 3.6 miles round-trip, for closer mountain views. Stands of aspen gave way to alpine meadows blooming with wild columbine and aspen sunflowers. The trail bisected one rock pile occupied by a family of pika, pudgy rabbit relatives who vocalized like squeaky toys.
By 9 a.m., as I descended back to the bus base, a steady stream of hikers were making their way up the trail with cellphone cameras pointed lakeside at a family of moose.
Adjusting to happy hour
While the outdoors are free, the indoors -- namely restaurants and bars -- require strategy.
"With happy hours, you're golden," advised my famously thrifty brother-in-law Chuck Leavitt, who lives near Aspen, noting the happy-hour deals that many restaurants offer during off-peak hours.
There are few locations better than Ajax Tavern, with a sprawling outdoor patio at the foot of Aspen Mountain. Its happy-hour deals slash margaritas from a nosebleed $ 19 to a reasonable $ 8. But the signature truffle fries, undiscounted, cost $ 21, and food specials like arancini at $ 15 weren't enough for dinner.
Besides limited menus, the problem with happy hours is adjusting to dining between the early-bird hours of 3 and 6 p.m., which I managed the next day at Mezzaluna. A veggie pizza ( $ 14) from its happy-hour menu provided ample leftovers for breakfast.
Lunches, thankfully, were easier. A sizable slice of pepperoni pizza at New York Pizza set me back $ 6.25. Red Fox Frozen Yogurt offers self-serve by the ounce (75 cents) so I limited myself to a $ 2 cup. My friend Tess Weaver, a writer who lives in nearby Basalt, suggested we meet at the Big Wrap for lunch, where her chicken pesto and my chicken Caesar -- both as generous as the business name implies -- cost $ 11 each.
"Most of my dates with friends are hikes, bike rides or river activities," she said, as we sat at a public table on shady Cooper Avenue and discussed spots to stage B.Y.O. après-sport picnics. "You meet people to do free things."
Cultural freebies
One considerable trickle-down benefit to the largess for which Aspen is famed is that most of its major cultural attractions are free, including the Aspen Art Museum. A few blocks from the ski hill, I toured exhibitions by the Iranian artist Nairy Baghramian and paintings by the German artist Florian Krewer before reaching the tranquil Rooftop Café, where a pick-me-up cappuccino cost $ 4.
Aspen's reputation as a cultural destination began after the Chicago businessman Walter Paepcke visited in the 1940s and envisioned the former mining town as a gathering place for artists, thinkers and leaders, an inspiration that would spawn the nonprofit Aspen Institute and the Aspen Music Festival and School. In 1946, he lured the artist and designer Herbert Bayer, who had studied and taught at the influential Bauhaus in Germany, to Aspen, where Bayer would design everything from Modernist homes to the Aspen leaf logo originally used by the local ski company.
Bayer's prolific work in textiles, book graphics and more is the subject of the year-old Resnick Center for Herbert Bayer Studies (free). A six-minute bike ride from downtown, the museum borders the 40-acre Aspen Institute grounds, which Bayer also designed. After an hour in the museum, I spent another outside with a free online guide from the Aspen Meadows resort, seeking out marble sculptures, earthworks and a topographic mural by the artist.
Next door, in a giant tent, caterers were preparing for a concert from the Aspen Music Festival, an eight-week summer series devoted to classical music and opera (through Aug. 20). Headlining performances by the opera singer Renée Fleming and other stars start at $ 75, but the calendar is loaded with free events, often performed by some of the school's more than 400 students (alumni include the violinist Joshua Bell and the composer Philip Glass).
That evening, I took a bus to the school's leafy campus about two miles out of town to attend a String Showcase, a free one-hour concert by violin and cello students who performed a range of music, from the French Romantic composer Ernest Chausson to the contemporary Turkish composer Fazil Say.
"The free events are important parts of what we do," said Laura E. Smith, the festival's marketing and communications vice president, estimating that roughly 70 percent of its programming is free. "More than a ticket sale, it's about heart and humans and enriching the world."
Backcountry day trips: $ 65
In summer, when mountain roads are free of snow, Aspen is a great base for day trips in the region, including exploring the Continental Divide on 12,095-foot Independence Pass. Extremely fit bicyclists make the roughly 20-mile ascent southeast of Aspen -- gaining over 4,000 feet in elevation -- but far more drive the twisting, narrow route on a seasonal stretch of Highway 82 that follows the cascading Roaring Fork River.
I hitched a ride with my sister and brother-in-law, who live in nearby Carbondale. Slushy ice still covered a pond ringed in wildflowers on the pass. Working our way back down the road, we parked below the pass to hike to Linkins Lake, a steep 1.2-mile round-trip in the Hunter-Fryingpan Wilderness for a lakeside picnic, and later wandered around the mining ghost town of Independence. At the Grottos, we waded into the icy river at a tumbling section known as the Cascades. We broke out a D.I.Y. happy hour at Devil's Punchbowl, entertained by jumpers from surrounding cliffs launching themselves into a river pool.
To replicate this day without freeloading, I would need to rent a car (Kayak lists them from $ 48 a day), pack a picnic (Grateful Deli's ham, turkey, Cheddar and Swiss, $ 10.50) and stock up on beer (25-ounce cans of Bud Light were recently priced at two for $ 6 at City Market grocery in Aspen), a roughly $ 65 outlay, not including gas. Rocky Mountain high: priceless.

Fashion Only Women Could Create: [Style Desk]

Full text: This fall, the Metropolitan and three other museums give female designers their due.
It is one of those ironies rarely discussed in the fashion industry -- that a world focused largely on catering to (or exploiting, depending on how you look at it) the dreams and identity of women is run mostly by men.
Men run the biggest luxury groups; men make up the largest percentage of the chief executives; and for years the most celebrated designers who take their bows at the end of the runways of the biggest global brand names were men.
To a certain extent, that dynamic has finally begun to shift: In 2016, Dior named its first female creative director for women's wear, Maria Grazia Chiuri; in 2019, Chanel appointed its first female designer since Coco, Virginie Viard; Hermès has women at the head of its women's and men's lines, Nadège Vanhee-Cybulski and Véronique Nichanian; and Phoebe Philo's return this fall under her own name may be the most anticipated new line of the year.
But LVMH, the largest luxury group in the world and Dior's owner, has only two other female designers at its 14 total fashion brands (plus a partnership with Stella McCartney). Kering, the second largest fashion-focused global luxury group, has but one female designer among its six ready-to-wear brands: Sarah Burton of Alexander McQueen. There's still a long way to go.
Which is why the announcement that the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art will devote its fall show to a survey of the work of female designers is so striking. Perhaps even more shocking is the fact that this is the Costume Institute's first such retrospective in the roughly 85 years of its existence.
While the Costume Institute has held a sprinkling of single shows dedicated to the work of women who changed fashion (Coco Chanel, Madame Grès, Rei Kawakubo, Elsa Schiaparelli and Miuccia Prada), it has never before taken a broad look at the female fashion canon -- or, indeed, posited that there is a female fashion canon and that it should be a larger part of the general fashion canon.
Even more notably, when the Met show opens on Dec. 7, it will be the punctuation mark at the end of months of museum shows celebrating women.
The correction starts in September with "Ann Lowe: American Couturier" at Winterthur in Delaware, the largest exhibition yet of the work of the visionary behind Jackie Kennedy's wedding dress and a Black designer who remained unsung for decades.
Next up, in October, is "Mood of the Moment: Gaby Aghion and the House of Chloé" at the Jewish Museum in New York, the first major exhibition devoted to the brand and its founder to be held in the city. That will be followed in November by "Iris van Herpen. Sculpting the Senses" at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris. All of which should add up to a potent reminder of the breadth and contributions of women designers -- not to mention a spur for the future.
"It can be complicated to do a show based on identity," said Mellissa Huber, an associate curator at the Met's Costume Institute and the co-curator, with Karen Van Godtsenhoven, of the museum's show "Women Dressing Women." "We don't want to categorize all female designers as working the same or being the same. Perhaps that's one thing that deterred people in the past. But this exhibit really is intended to be about celebration and acknowledgment."
As it happens, Ms. Huber and Ms. Van Godtsenhoven had proposed similar female-focused retrospective shows to Andrew Bolton, the Costume Institute's curator in charge, around the same time in 2019, the year before the 100th anniversary of women's suffrage. They decided to team up, but the Covid-19 pandemic intervened, postponing the show to this year.
The result showcases the work of about 70 designers held in the Costume Institute's collection, which stretches from the turn of the 20th century to today and includes names both famous (Jeanne Lanvin, Claire McCardell) and little known (Augusta Bernard, Madeleine & Madeleine). And it is a reminder that once upon a time, the industry looked very different.
"The '20s and '30s were a period when women designers were incredibly active and prolific, and it's the one moment in history when women actually slightly outnumbered men in leading the creative direction of fashion," Ms. Huber said. "But that moment never really, truly occurred again."
As to why the shift, Ms. Huber said it had to do with "gender and social change and a lack of confidence on the part of the financial community to invest in women" after World War II. "When we had the New Look in '47 with Dior, there was a major tidal change," she continued. "We've never entirely recovered."
To illustrate how we got here, the Costume Institute show traces the work of female designers from their anonymous beginnings, when, Ms. Huber said, "many women were working in a field that didn't recognize the contributions of individual makers" through the hegemony of the French couture houses, when Chanel, Schiaparelli, Vionnet and Grès dominated.
Then it moves on to what Ms. Huber calls "the boutique generation" of the 1960s -- designers like Mary Quant and Bonnie Cashin, who cleared their own path -- culminating in pieces by designers working today and "thinking collaboratively, considering notions of sustainability and inclusivity."
Along the way the exhibition rights a few historical wrongs, such as the often mistaken attribution of the famous Fortuny Delphos gown solely to the Fortuny founder, Mariano Fortuny, instead of to his wife, Adèle Henriette Negrin Fortuny.
"The Delphos dress is a great example of something that is very canonized, very familiar, even to nonspecialists," Ms. Huber said. But the pleating patent that had been filed for the gown includes a handwritten note from Mr. Fortuny noting "that Henriette Negrin Fortuny was actually the rightful inventor and that essentially he filed it under his name for expediency," Ms. Huber said.
"To realize that there was actually another person behind the dress who had been removed from the historical record for so long was astonishing," Ms. Huber added.
The show also enabled the curators to add the work of at least a dozen new names to the museum's holdings, including Marine Serre, Anifa Mvuemba of Hanifa and Hillary Taymour of Collina Strada, thus carving out a permanent space for them in the historical record and ensuring, Ms. Huber said, that this is simply the start of "a much longer ongoing conversation."
"I think it's a very exciting moment for women designers," she added. What really matters is what happens next, now that "this critical mass of voices is suddenly coming together."

Full text: "Amore," Hugh Findletar shouted. "Amore!"
The words echoed through Studio Salvadore, a family-run glassblowing workshop on Murano, the Italian island near Venice known for its centuries-old glass industry. It was 3 p.m. on a Friday in late July, and Mr. Findletar had been making drinking glasses with a small team since around 6:30 in the morning. The temperature near the studio's furnaces had risen to as high as about 120 degrees.
At the mouth of a furnace, colorful glass rods lined up on the head of a shovel were melting together. Mr. Findletar, 49, flicked water droplets at the glass, which would become a cup, to make bubbles. Then he moved to a table with bowls full of ground glass that looked more like sand. He took pinches of the particles, in shades of lemon yellow and Campari red, and dusted them onto the cup to create splotches.
"I call this dirtying up the glass," Mr. Findletar said. Some of the pieces being made that day were for India Mahdavi, an interior designer and architect, who is starting to sell his glassware at her namesake boutique in Paris.
Though Mr. Findletar makes housewares like cups, he is perhaps best known for his bust-like vases, which he calls "flowerheadz." The "z," he said, is for his daughter, Zadie, who was named after the writer Zadie Smith. He uses the letter liberally: Mr. Findletar refers to his pieces collectively as "glassz," and he has made sculptures of horses, fish and shells that he calls "horseheadz," "fishiez" and "shellz."
The flowerheadz vases are usually based on people, and he has made versions inspired by the model Naomi Campbell, a doorwoman who works at his apartment building in Milan and Solomon, the biblical king. The pieces start at $ 25,000, and Mr. Findletar encourages buyers to fill them with flowers. (He likes cattail, anthurium, hydrangea and palmetto, which he said create dramatic hairdos.)
Angela Missoni, 65, the president of the Missoni fashion brand, has bought three of the vases, including the King Solomon edition. Ms. Missoni compared arranging flowers in the pieces to "taking them to the hairdresser."
Other collectors include Marina Prada, the sister of Miuccia Prada, and the designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, who have commissioned flowerheadz vases in their likenesses. King Mohammed VI of Morocco bought a school of eight fishiez sculptures at L'Éclaireur, a luxury store in Paris. (Each cost about $ 7,500.)
Glass by Way of Photography
In September, Mr. Findletar will introduce new flowerheadz vases at Bergdorf Goodman in Midtown Manhattan, as part of a group art show hosted by the Spaceless Gallery in the department store's home décor section.
Some of the pieces are modeled after people connected to New York, including the jazz singer Billie Holiday; Patricia Field, the merchant turned "Sex and the City" costume designer; and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who Mr. Findletar rendered in bubble-gum pink, a reference to the color of the Chanel suit she was wearing on the day her first husband, President John F. Kennedy, was shot.
Mr. Findletar typically works with five other artisans to create each flowerheadz vase. (Ears are applied last.) He has been working with many of the same people for more than a decade. "When I start with somebody, there's a wedding," he said of the professional bonds he has made.
His path to becoming a glass artist -- and to Murano, where he lives on most weekends -- was not exactly direct.
Mr. Findletar was born in Jamaica and was raised by his maternal grandparents and great-grandparents, who ran a banana and coffee farm in St. Ann Parish, until he was 8. His interest in flowers, he said, came from his childhood in what's known as Jamaica's garden parish.
He then moved to New York and lived with his parents in Brooklyn. His early jobs in the city included working for a political club and managing the floor at a home décor shop, Mr. Findletar said. He also worked as a housekeeping supervisor at a hotel on the Upper East Side, which is now closed. He recalled Tina Turner staying there. "I went and smelled everything in her room," he said.
In the late 1980s, Mr. Findletar started working as an assistant to the photographer Ken Nahoum, who specialized in celebrity portraiture. Later, in the 1990s, he assisted other photographers, including Michel Comte on shoots with Sophia Loren and other notable subjects. Around the same time, Mr. Findletar also began working as a photographer; his portraits have appeared in The New York Times and elsewhere.
"For a long time, my career was only photography," he said.
He had moved from New York to Milan by the time he went to Kenya in 1999 on a photography job for the Italian edition of Marie Claire. He stayed in Kenya for about a month, he said, and during that time he visited Anselm's Kitengela Hot Glass, a glassblowing studio on the outskirts of Nairobi, where he started taking lessons in the craft.
Mr. Findletar said he first made vases that he would use for floral arrangements, some of which he would photograph. He also began to experiment with making glass masks, after buying a wooden mask made by members of Kenya's Kikuyu tribe.
Eventually, Mr. Findletar said, he thought, "What if I put a mask on a vase, and flowers in the vase?"
"Ding-dong!" he added of the idea that became the foundation for his flowerheadz pieces.
Mr. Findletar pursued glass work as a hobby for about a decade while continuing to work as a photographer. He became more serious about glass, he said, after being invited to show some vases at the 2013 edition of Germany's International Design Week. Before the festival, Mr. Findletar went to Murano to refine his technique. He said the island is one of the very best places to be for glass.
An 'Outsider-Outsider' in Venice
On the island he met Oscar Zanetti, the head of Zanetti Murano, a glassblowing studio that Mr. Zanetti's family has operated since the 1950s.
"He's a character," Mr. Zanetti, 62, said of Mr. Findletar. "I liked him. I liked his ideas." But he "didn't know glass well when he arrived and really had to try hard to learn," Mr. Zanetti said.
Around the time Mr. Findletar started working with Mr. Zanetti, he met Lino Tagliapietra, another master glassblower, at a bar on Murano. (Mr. Tagliapietra has collaborated on various projects with the artist Dale Chihuly.) Mr. Findletar said he helped advance his understanding of the theory of glass as a modern art.
Mr. Findletar, who now rents work space at Mr. Zanetti's studio and others on Murano, is among a handful of Black glass artists who have penetrated the native industry in Venice, said Adrienne Childs, an art historian and an associate at the W.E.B. Du Bois Research Institute at Harvard. Others include Fred Wilson, a Black American artist whose black glass chandeliers were made on Murano, and the Senegalese artisan Moulaye Niang, who studied at the Abate Zanetti School of Glass -- Venice's only glassmaking school -- and helped found a studio, Muranero, in the city.
Outsiders in the field are not usually Black, Mr. Findletar said. He described himself as an "outsider-outsider" -- or a particularly rare presence -- on Murano and in Venice. "I consider myself a Moor in all this," he added, using a term once used in Europe to describe Muslims and people from Northern Africa, and which was later used to generally describe people with dark skin, like Shakespeare's character Othello.
Dr. Childs said that decorative objects called blackamoors, which portray Black people in problematic ways, are still made in Venice. They typically feature Black servants and enslaved people, she said, dressed in fashionable livery that represented the wealth of their owners or employers.
Reni Folawiyo, the owner of Alára, a boutique in Lagos, Nigeria, brought four of Mr. Findletar's vases to a pop-up shop she curated for this year's "Africa Fashion" exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum, which runs through October.
Ms. Folawiyo said that from the 1970s to the 1990s, Venetian glass tiles and chandeliers were considered status items in Nigerian homes. By supporting Mr. Findletar, she said, she is hoping to raise his profile in Africa and to boost its glassblowing industry.
"Our diaspora is very important to the story we tell," she said. "I think more people need to know Hugh's work."
Mr. Findletar is also attempting to promote the African glass industry, he said, by developing a series of glass masks informed by Venetian romanticism with the studio in Kenya where he learned the basics of glassblowing.
He said he sees making the flowerheadz vases as a way of trying to repopulate the planet with "my people of every color, even green." (He gives some pieces a green complexion similar to the color of bamboo canes.) He added that, through his work, he is "bringing that Rift Valley energy to Venice," referring to the swath of East Africa where some of humans' oldest ancestors lived.
As he put it, "I'm playing God."

'The Notebook' Musical Is Coming to Broadway: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The adaptation of the popular Nicholas Sparks romance novel, with music and lyrics by Ingrid Michaelson, had a well-reviewed run last year in Chicago.
"The Notebook," Nicholas Sparks's best-selling 1996 novel about a star-crossed couple's lifelong romance, which was adapted into a 2004 film starring Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling, will soon arrive in New York in another form: a Broadway musical.
The production had a well-reviewed world premiere at the Chicago Shakespeare Theater last fall. Steven Oxman of The Chicago Sun-Times wrote that it represented "a significant leap in artistic quality over its sources, which it respects, while also providing a clear, resonant and unique voice of its own." He had particular praise for the "poetic" songs, by the indie singer-songwriter Ingrid Michaelson, and the "impressive" onstage rainstorm.
Previews are scheduled to begin Feb. 6, and the opening is set for March 14 at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, most recently home to "Life of Pi."
The story of the couple, Noah and Allie, is relayed in flashbacks that come to life as the older Noah reads from a notebook detailing their love story to the older Allie, who has dementia. (In a change from the book and the film, the story now begins in the 1960s instead of the 1940s.)
In the Chicago production, Allie and Noah were each played by three different actors, who embodied them at various ages. The younger and older versions of the characters often share the stage, with the older couple watching as scenes from their past unfold. (Jordan Tyson and John Cardoza played the teenage Allie and Noah; Joy Woods and Ryan Vasquez depicted them in their late 20s; and Maryann Plunkett and John Beasley played the older versions.)
Casting for Broadway has not yet been announced, but one casting change is certain: Beasley, who played the older incarnation of Noah, died in May at 79.
The Chicago creative team will return for the Broadway run: Michael Greif ("Dear Evan Hansen," "Rent") and Schele Williams ("Aida," "The Wiz") will direct, with choreography by Katie Spelman (associate choreographer of "Moulin Rouge! The Musical"). Bekah Brunstetter ("This Is Us") wrote the book, with music and lyrics by Michaelson, a first-time theater composer. It will be produced by Kevin McCollum ("Six," "The Devil Wears Prada") and Kurt Deutsch, an executive at Warner Music Group.
"The Notebook," which was Sparks's first published novel, consistently ranks among the most popular of his more than 20 books. Though the film adaptation -- directed by Nick Cassavetes from a screenplay by Jeremy Leven and adapted by Jan Sardi from the novel -- received mixed reviews, it became one of the highest-grossing romantic dramas of all time.

Ripples From a Strike Touch Fashion's World: [Style Desk]

Full text: The actors' strike could have far-reaching implications for how we watch and consume fashion.
At first it seemed impossible to imagine: No more red carpets! No more photos of movie stars and names to watch in fabulous gowns blanketing the internet. Could "Oppenheimer" and "Barbie" be the last gasp of that marketing Valhalla of fashion and film that was the modern premiere -- at least for the foreseeable future?
At least, that is, until the SAG-AFTRA actor's strike, announced July 14, is resolved. For the moment, actors, from the unknown to the most celebrated, are banned by their union from engaging in any promotional activities. That means big openings. That means magazine covers touting new movies. That means film festivals with all their associated dressing and posing opportunities. That means social media pics of them getting dressed for premieres.
And what that means for fashion, an industry that has become increasingly intertwined with the denizens of Lalaland in a mutually beneficial ecosystem of influence and outfits -- and as important, what it means for the public's understanding of fashion, much of which is received through the lens of celebrity -- is potentially enormous.
Actors sign contracts that can be worth millions, negotiated by agents and managers, to be brand ambassadors, appearing in some combination of advertisements, front rows, store openings and red carpets, dressed by stylists, generating coverage, desire and, most of all, publicity for everyone involved.
Their work may form their substance, but fashion is the grease that sends them viral (and that has bolstered their bank accounts at a time when the economics of movies are shifting -- part of the reason for the strike). Timothée Chalamet on the red carpet in Venice in a crimson Haider Ackermann halter top and Florence Pugh in a sheer pink Valentino "revenge dress" are images that put those actors and those brands at the center of social media for days.
Alison Bringé, the chief marketing officer at Launchmetrics, a data analytics and software company, wrote in an email that Margot Robbie's appearance in Schiaparelli at the film's Los Angeles premiere "generated over $ 2.1 million in media impact value in just 24 hours, which is more than half of what Schiaparelli's fall 2023 show amassed overall."
With all of that grinding to a halt, along with studio productions themselves, what happens? And who are most at risk? Actors and studios are not the only ones with a stake in this game.
At the moment, agents and talent seem to be holding their breath and swiveling their heads to see what everyone else is doing. The brands themselves are staying mum. Louis Vuitton, whose ambassadors include Jennifer Connelly, Michelle Williams and Ana de Armas, declined to comment. Versace, which works with Anne Hathaway, ditto. Prada, ditto. Gucci, ditto. Dior did not respond to requests for comment.
In theory, all fashion promotional work (as opposed to movie promotional work) can continue. Commercial appearances are not prohibited, according to the strike guidelines. And there are myriad such opportunities that have nothing to do with premieres. Recently Wimbledon turned into a catwalk of sorts for celebrities including Emma Corrin and Brad Pitt.
Much has been made of the fact that the first big red carpet victim will be the Venice Film Festival, scheduled for Aug. 30 to Sept. 9, and the de facto start of awards season, with all the fashion fanfare that implies.
This year the films rumored to be showing star Zendaya, a Louis Vuitton ambassador (Luca Guadagnino's "Challengers"); Jessica Chastain, who works with Gucci (Michael Franco's "Memory"); Emma Stone, also a Louis Vuitton ambassador (Yorgos Lanthimos's "Poor Things"); and Penélope Cruz, who works with Chanel (Michael Mann's "Ferrari"). All of them will most likely be absent.
Yet, as it happens, early September is also New York Fashion Week, and the start of the whole fashion season. That's four weeks of potential for appearances and events.
Even more pointedly, brands themselves have increasingly tiptoed into the content arena, making short films, especially during the pandemic. What sorts of non-studio videos could they cook up? Entirely independent films are allowed under strike guidelines. YSL even has its own film production division. The studios would look selfless -- supporting talent -- and the talent would look, well, good. When given lemons. ...
Indeed, the strike may make brand relationships even more important, both as a source of income and as a creative outlet. "The first writers strike, our teams were busier than ever, because a lot of the actors had to do more promotional appearances to subsidize for any slowing in their main vocation," said Brooke Wall, the founder of the Wall Group, a talent agency for stylists that is part of the Endeavor group.
That's one way of looking at it. The issue is thornier, however, because of the morality and optics involved. Even if SAG-AFTRA members are allowed by the rules to continue their outside work, will it not seem gauche to do so? Given the glitz and champagne associated with fashion, it could seem a bit like partying while Rome burns.
Fran Drescher, the SAG-AFTRA president and face of the strike, received vociferous blowback when she attended the Dolce & Gabbana Alta Moda couture extravaganza/junket in Puglia, Italy, just before the strike was announced, even though a spokeswoman for the union told The Hollywood Reporter that it knew about the trip, and it was fine. Add in the fact that it is often the most boldface names in the industry who have snagged the biggest outside contracts -- exactly that layer of Hollywood that does not necessarily need work during a stoppage -- and the situation gets even more complicated.
On the other hand, there is a whole substratum of talent who are not at the negotiating table and yet are seriously affected by the red carpet suspension: the stylists and hair and makeup artists who help create the image-making magic, and whose salaries are generally paid for by the studios, not the talent.
"There is no work!" said Kate Young, a stylist whose work focuses on Hollywood.
The end of movie promotion is a "massive issue," according to the stylist Karla Welch, who said she had had four premiere tours cut short or canceled already. "Basically any stylist who works with celebs just saw all their jobs go away," she said. "The only thing celebs' people can do are fashion jobs, and that's the few people who have celebs with brand deals."
This may be partly why there has been little noise thus far about suspending brand appearances. There is a trickle-down effect at work that is not insignificant when it comes to people's livelihoods. Still, Ms. Wall said, "this is a whole new world, so we shall see."
Indeed, there is a scenario in which the suspension of the red carpet has the unintended but far-reaching consequence of decoupling fashion and Hollywood, or at least significantly changing the balance of power. It could prove to brands that they need celluloid celebrities less than they may think, ushering in a new era of ambassadors focused on the rest of the world and talent that has nothing to do with back lots or Oscar statuettes. Really, it has already begun.
Two names: BTS and Beyoncé.

Full text: In what now seems the quaint era of Truman Capote's baroque social diagrams, what distinguished the truly wealthy from the merely rich was the better vegetables they served: "tiny ones."
Were Capote alive today to freeload off his social betters, the details he would most likely espy might not involve the fare at their tables -- even the mega-rich do takeout -- but the Hallstein water they import from Austria, or their $ 15,000 computer-operated Danish TopBrewer coffee systems, or the $ 700 hand-embroidered monogrammed towel sets they order from the cult Florentine linen shop Loretta Caponi, or even the subtle toggles they use to switch off a light.
Lately throughout gentrified Brooklyn -- or Hollywood on Hudson, as some call a borough now home to Adam Driver, Matt Damon, Michelle Williams, and Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz -- the brownstone superrich signal domestic chic with decorative details like a $ 220 light switch manufactured by the English company Forbes & Lomax.
For the average home renovator, of course, a $ 22 Leviton light switch from Home Depot does the job just fine. Yet no five-story Brooklyn Heights behemoth, where the obligatory uncurtained windows open up on scenes reminiscent of ethnological dioramas (Exhibit A: Lives of the 21st-Century Technocrats), can be considered complete anymore without Forbes & Lomax toggles in each room.
"They're house jewelry," said David Hottenroth, a partner in the architectural firm Hottenroth & Joseph, referring to the elegant 1930s-style switches made of nickel, bronze and brass.
Or they are a domestic version of Kendall Roy's Loro Piana baseball cap in "Succession" (remember "Succession"?): absurdly costly, yet so subtle you only notice them if you already know how expensive they are?
"Nothing should be noticed" is a dictum often attributed to the heiress Bunny Mellon. In truth, the reverse was improbably the case. It was in Mellon's ostentatiously modest habit of ordering haute couture garden aprons from Givenchy and hanging her best Braque in a basket room that one could detect early groundwork being laid for what would eventually be marketed as "quiet luxury," according to the Mellon biographer Mac Griswold. "That sort of 'What me -- rich?' attitude originates with her," Ms. Griswold said.
For Old Money like Mellon's, discretion was indeed a key value, while for those in the class of New Old Money -- that is, great fortunes made, often in tech, in a time frame bracketed by Myspace and TikTok -- wealth display is noticeable, but only to those who know what they're looking for.
"It's the Loro Piana effect and it's a smoke screen," said William Norwich, a novelist and editor who, in a previous professional incarnation, had a front-row seat on New York's moneyed elite as a gossip columnist in the 1980s for The New York Post. "It's code," he added. "You telegraph status without seeming to do it."
And, as trends go, "stealth wealth" was one well suited to a moment in which social media has made us all into de facto voyeurs, noses pressed to the digital window as the grotesquely wealthy flaunt their toys, their cars, their designer fashions, the closets in their 35,000-square-foot Calabasas mansions devoted to Hermès Birkin bags. "We are collectively spending more time checking out what the rich and famous are doing and less time on what Barry from H.R. and Sandra from accounting were up to last weekend," said Nicholas Bloom, the William D. Eberle professor of economics at Stanford.
We are parsing Veblenesque narratives laid out for us by glossy strangers, people like the supermodel and philanthropist Karlie Kloss, who happens to be married to Josh Kushner -- an investor whose stake in onetime start-ups like Instagram, Spotify and Slack yielded a personal fortune estimated at $ 3.6 billion.
In posts created for the delectation of her 12 million Instagram followers, Ms. Kloss conjures a narrative in which she and her family inhabit a digital empyrean, someplace universes away from the paycheck-to-paycheck worries of hoi polloi. In Kushner-Kloss world, the light is always honeyed, air travel quietly private and human and divine seemingly will converge somewhere in the Grenadines aboard the poop deck of the billionaire David Geffen's humongous Lürssen yacht, Rising Sun.
"Wealth porn," Stellene Volandes, editor in chief of Town & Country, termed such postings. And as with any permutation of adult entertainment, it's free online: Anyone can watch.
Things were not always thus. Back in the remote Reagan '80s, also an era of unbridled wealth creation, opulent status display may have been occasionally grotesque (think birthday parties for 500 in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Temple of Dendur), and yet they were far less visible to the general public. Hedge fund moguls, predacious leveraged-buyout kings and real estate tycoons competed shamelessly to out-party, out-dress and out-spend one another, mounting lavish entertainments for "Champagne-swilling, caviar-supping, Lacroix-wearing" guests, as The New York Times once noted. Yet their excesses were noted by a relative few.
"In the '80s, you could give a private party in a public venue like the Met, wear Lacroix poufs, have Robert Isabell design a one-night-only Versailles décor for you, flying in all the flowers in Holland," Mr. Norwich said. "And the only risk to your privacy was maybe a few media outlets hovering outside with a pen and pad."
Showiness of that kind is not only frowned upon in the age of New Old Money. It risks courting the dangers common to countries where the greatly wealthy are obliged to live heavily guarded and sequestered lives. "You don't want to become a target," Mr. Norwich added. Hence in recent years, the offspring of plutocrats -- the billionaire Mort Zuckerman's teen daughter for example -- find themselves chauffeured to drop-off at elite private schools in S.U.V.s replete with tinted windows and attendant security detail. "Those '80s excesses could not have happened if everyone had an iPhone," Mr. Norwich said.
Privacy, discretion and to a large extent anonymity are the baseline for stealth wealth. The quiet luxury trope developed to conceal the unvarying truth that the essential status marker is "how much space you take up," as Mr. Norwich said.
He meant economic space. And in that respect, Americans dominate the world, the superrich here making up more than a third of the global population of ultrahigh net-worth individuals (UHNWI), according to a Wealth Report issued by Knight Frank, an independent real estate consultancy that has its headquarters in London. It is that group (a club whose entry point is $ 30 million in net worth), far more than the "1 percent," that increasingly comes to define a new world order at the upper echelons of income.
Not surprisingly, that UHNWI group also occupies space in a literal sense, given that between them, the 13 largest individual landowners in the country -- think John C. Malone, the owner of Liberty Media and the Atlanta Braves; Ted Turner; or Peter Buck, the Subway co-founder -- control over 16.9 million acres of land in the contiguous 48 states, an area equivalent to the size of West Virginia.
If '80s style excesses remain -- and they assuredly do -- they are played down, low-key, hidden in plain sight. This was subtly evidenced at a Manhattan benefit held this year for the Society of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, an event celebrating the opening of the prestigious TEFAF Art Fair. Assembled at the Park Avenue Armory were 91 of the world's top-ranked dealers in fine art from all periods, high jewelry and antiques dating to 18th Dynasty Egypt.
Assembled, too, were members of more freshly minted dynasties, who turned out in robust numbers for an event that, despite platinum-level tickets priced at $ 10,000, has historically drawn one of the toniest crowds from among New York's ultrawealthy elite. What was conspicuous about the event was not so much the presence of shoppers undaunted by six- and even seven-figure price tags for objects like a Gustav Klimt sketch study of a Gorgon or "The Mountain Bar," a louche, atmospheric barroom installation by the Cuban American artist Jorge Pardo, but how inconspicuous the attendees were in their manner of dress.
There was nary an "it" bag to be spotted that evening. And, while people were undoubtedly dressed in costly designer labels, the labels they wore were from Khaite, the Row or Prada -- chic but anonymous and decidedly logo-free. Far from presenting the usual wall of $ 7,000 suits from Kiton, the men at the event were illustrations of what the Robb Report termed the "Succession" effect -- subtle sport coats from Brunello Cucinelli or Loro Piana, "dress" sneakers like a currently popular model from Berluti that, while it wouldn't be out of place on a shelf at Modell's, cost $ 1,600 a pair.
To the extent that people wore jewels at all, they were not creations by traditional zillionaire go-tos like JAR -- whose pave brooches studded with rubies, pink sapphires and tourmalines were long worn like pledge badges by society folk like Jo Carole Lauder, Princess Firyal of Jordan and Anne Bass -- but ostentatiously low-key baubles like the much-coveted Harmony bangle made by the storied Munich jeweler Hemmerle.
These unassuming adornments are in themselves a case study in the evolution of the status symbols, since in earlier iterations of the 30-year-old design it often came studded with gems and was about as subtle as a Mighty Morphin Power Ranger bracelet. Gradually, the Harmony design was refined to oblige a developing taste for things that, however costly, did not scream money. Many Harmony bangles are now formed of base metals like aluminum, iron or carved olive wood. Inset with tiny cola-colored diamonds, some look like relics unearthed from a Celtic burial mound.
Yet they are hugely in demand despite being no one's idea of a bargain. "We don't really give prices," Christian Hemmerle, scion of the family company, said by email. For perspective, consider that an iron Harmony bangle was hammered down at a Christie's London auction in June for $ 13,000 and that one made from wood and brown diamonds sold at Sotheby's in April for $ 103,000.
"You know, I want something I can wear every day without looking ridiculous," one Hemmerle client at the TEFAF fair said, on condition that her family's well-known name not appear in print. "Let's face it," she added. "The status pendulum has swung on the Birkin bag."
In a sense, status at all times and in every society is calibrated, "according to the group you associate yourself with, your position and rank in relation to others," said Ronit Lami, a wealth psychologist and therapist to UHNWIs.
Not only is flaunting wealth now frowned upon at the highest levels of income, Dr. Lami added, it sets in play competitive games there is no guarantee one can win. "Let's say you have one private plane: So what?" Dr. Lami said. "For a multibillionaire, one private plane probably won't be considered a status symbol. They may have five or six."
Similarly, that $ 20 million brownstone in the West Village or that penthouse on Fifth Avenue may not be the trophy you thought it was, given that for many in certain income strata, extensive residential portfolios are routine. "Fifty million and above is a trophy," Kurt Rappaport, a Los Angeles real estate agent specializing in elite properties, said flatly.
Consider a Spanish colonial Malibu mansion Mr. Rappaport sold last year. Its buyer was an Oscar-nominated producer and heir to a brewing fortune. The price tag was $ 91 million and very likely, Mr. Rappaport said, the bluff-top estate was not intended as its new owner's primary residence. "These properties are extensions of the owners' presence and persona, but in an elevated way," he said. "It's on a much different level from posting your bling on Instagram. That's not status. That's showing off glitz."
For the New Old Money, discretion is the ultimate flex, said Ms. Volandes of Town & Country. "The power move is not posting, not sharing," she said. "It's knowing where to go first, what to buy first, pivoting away from the crowd, not in any way following it and not showing off. "
Yes, she added, there will always be those that load themselves down like caparisoned pack mules with status symbols like logo bags and diamonds. Assuredly, clueless billionaires will ride rockets into space with Stetsons clamped to their heads. But gaucherie is not arrival. And taste as currently constituted demands the hushed tones of a quiet luxury that, as Ms. Volandes added, is not in fact all that quiet. "You just have to adjust your hearing."
Or change your sightline. Notable in a new line of men's wear from the Italian designer Brunello Cucinelli, for example, is a sports coat so low-key as to look generic. Pale camel in color, it has three buttons, patch pockets and a sporty band collar. Some version of the jacket can probably be found in most every haberdashery in Italy and, for all one knows, on the sales floor at Macy's Herald Square.
Yet Mr. Cucinelli -- a farmer's son from Umbria who parlayed a line of cashmere sweaters into a billion-dollar personal fortune -- does not design clothes for Everyman. He proudly creates "uniforms for the wealthy," as he recently said by telephone.
He designs with such devoted clients in mind as Marc Benioff, co-founder and chief executive of Salesforce. As a multibillionaire and longtime Cucinelli aficionado, Mr. Benioff would most likely recognize the jacket as being from the Italian designer's exclusive line of creations rendered in vicuña -- a rare, ultrafine wool harvested from llama-like animals in Bolivia. And he may not be daunted by its $ 24,500 price tag since, to a man worth $ 8 billion, that is roughly equivalent to someone earning $ 80,000 a year spending a quarter on a coat.
"When you talk about wealth, it is all a matter of scale," Dr. Lami said.

To the extent that people wore jewels at all, they were not creations by traditional zillionaire go-tos such as JAR — whose pave brooches studded with rubies, pink sapphires and tourmalines were long worn like pledge badges by society folk such as Jo Carol Lauder, Princess Firyal of Jordan and Anne Bass — but ostentatiously low-key baubles such as the much-coveted Harmony bangle made by the storied Munich jeweler Hemmerle.
These unassuming adornments are in themselves a case study in the evolution of the status symbols, since in earlier iterations of the 30-year-old design it often came studded with gems and was about as subtle as a Mighty Morphin Power Ranger bracelet. Gradually, the Harmony design was refined to oblige a developing taste for things that, however costly, did not scream money. Many Harmony bangles are now formed of base metals such as aluminum, iron or carved olive wood. Inset with tiny cola-colored diamonds, some look like relics unearthed from a Celtic burial mound.
Yet they are hugely in demand despite being no one’s idea of a bargain. “We don’t really give prices,” Christian Hemmerle, scion of the family company, said by email. For perspective, consider that an iron Harmony bangle was hammered down at a Christie’s London auction in June for $13,000 and that one made from wood and brown diamonds sold at Sotheby’s in April for $103,000.
“You know, I want something I can wear every day without looking ridiculous,” one Hemmerle client at the TEFAF fair said, on condition that her family’s well-known name not appear in print. “Let’s face it,” she added. “The status pendulum has swung on the Birkin bag.”
In a sense, status at all times and in every society is calibrated, “according to the group you associate yourself with, your position and rank in relation to others,” said Ronit Lami, a wealth psychologist and therapist to UHNWIs.
Not only is flaunting wealth now frowned upon at the highest levels of income, Lami added, it sets in play competitive games there is no guarantee one can win. “Let’s say you have one private plane: So what?” Lami said. “For a multibillionaire, one private plane probably won’t be considered a status symbol. They may have five or six.”
Similarly, that $20 million brownstone in the West Village or that penthouse on Fifth Avenue may not be the trophy you thought it was, given that for many in certain income strata, extensive residential portfolios are routine. “Fifty million and above is a trophy,” Kurt Rappaport, a Los Angeles real estate agent specializing in elite properties, said flatly.
Consider a Spanish colonial Malibu mansion Rappaport sold last year. Its buyer was an Oscar-nominated producer and heir to a brewing fortune. The price tag was $91 million and very likely, Rappaport said, the bluff-top estate was not intended as its new owner’s primary residence. “These properties are extensions of the owners’ presence and persona, but in an elevated way,” he said. “It’s on a much different level from posting your bling on Instagram. That’s not status. That’s showing off glitz.”
For the New Old Money, discretion is the ultimate flex, said Volandes of Town & Country. “The power move is not posting, not sharing,” she said. “It’s knowing where to go first, what to buy first, pivoting away from the crowd, not in any way following it and not showing off. ”
Yes, she added, there will always be those that load themselves down like caparisoned pack mules with status symbols such as logo bags and diamonds. Assuredly, clueless billionaires will ride rockets into space with Stetsons clamped to their heads. But gaucherie is not arrival. And taste as currently constituted demands the hushed tones of a quiet luxury that, as Volandes added, is not in fact all that quiet. “You just have to adjust your hearing.”
Or change your sightline. Notable in a new line of menswear from Italian designer Brunello Cucinelli, for example, is a sports coat so low-key as to look generic. Pale camel in color, it has three buttons, patch pockets and a sporty band collar. Some version of the jacket can probably be found in most every haberdashery in Italy and, for all one knows, on the sales floor at Macy’s Herald Square.
Yet Cucinelli — a farmer’s son from Umbria who parlayed a line of cashmere sweaters into a billion-dollar personal fortune — does not design clothes for Everyman. He proudly creates “uniforms for the wealthy,” as he recently said by telephone.
He designs with such devoted clients in mind as Marc Benioff, co-founder and CEO of Salesforce. As a multibillionaire and longtime Cucinelli aficionado, Benioff would most likely recognize the jacket as being from the Italian designer’s exclusive line of creations rendered in vicuña — a rare, ultrafine wool harvested from llama-like animals in Bolivia. And he may not be daunted by its $24,500 price tag since, to a man worth $8 billion, that is roughly equivalent to someone earning $80,000 a year spending a quarter on a coat.
“When you talk about wealth, it is all a matter of scale,” Lami said.

Full text: Anya Firestone leads what she calls "cou-tours" around Paris: Tours tailored to the clients' interests, be they dinosaurs, drag queens or booze.
On a recent morning at the Louvre, Anya Firestone handed out bottles of Evian. "Because 'the art of drinking' begins with hydration," she said.
Ms. Firestone, 34, a museum guide-conférencière (tour guide) and art integration strategist, wore rhinestone earrings in the shape of olive martinis, pink Manolo Blahniks, the Mini Bar clutch by Charlotte Olympia and a Marni dress printed with likenesses of Venus.
She escorted Matt Stanley, her client, and his Parisian date, Salomé Bes, 30, past the long lines at the museum's entrance and toward the Code of Hammurabi. The set of ancient Babylonian laws included "an eye for an eye," she explained, and it also dealt with issues of alcoholic beverages, like watered-down wine and the peoples' "right to beer," as she pithily put it.
"Pretty impressive!" said Mr. Stanley, the chief executive of a memory care community near Austin, Texas. Mr. Stanley, 43, had hired Ms. Firestone to design a two-day visit around alcohol.
"You're going to see that drinking and art had the same upbringing and moved in the same direction -- from a religious context with prayers and libations to decadence and debauchery," said Ms. Firestone, who calls her custom tours "cou-tours," a play on couture.
Last fall, Ms. Firestone starred in "The Real Girlfriends of Paris," a reality show broadcast on Bravo that followed six 20- and 30-something American women as they navigated work, life and l'amour. She said that the opportunity to put her business, called Maison Firestone, on public view was the main reason she had done the show.
But Ms. Firestone had also liked the idea of elevating the oft-scorned TV genre with art and culture. (Not to mention some pun- and Yiddish-inflected wit.) "By the way," she said, "I don't describe myself as American. I say I'm New-Yorkaise."
Ms. Firestone was raised in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood Manhattan; her parents were actors. She first moved to Paris in 2010 after college at George Washington University, for an artist residency, during which she wrote poetry and sculpted oversize macarons. (People thought they were colorful hamburgers," she said, explaining that the confection had not become popular yet.)
She worked briefly as an au pair, channeling Mary Poppins and Maria von Trapp, she said. But Ms. Firestone likened her current plot to the TV shows "Emily in Paris" -- "Love her chutzpah, less her bucket hats," she said of the protagonist -- and "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel."
After a master's degree in French cultural studies from Columbia Global Center in Paris, she spent a few years traveling between New York and Paris, offering custom tours and writing about art and brand intersections for Highsnobiety. Maison Firestone -- which also designs themed events with luxury brands -- followed from that interest in "art as branding," she said.
At "Winged Victory of Samothrace," a white marble statue from Hellenistic Greece, better known as "Niké," for example, Ms. Firestone noted that the figure's wings had inspired the sportswear empire's Swoosh logo.
Ms. Firestone's clients used to find her only by word of mouth, but now about half of them, including Mr. Stanley, come to her via the Bravo show and Instagram. The majority are visiting France from the United States; the cost of a tour starts at $ 2,400 for one or two people for one day.
Her angle is to take "art off the wall to show its intersection with things that people already enjoy and consume," Ms. Firestone said, be it champagne or Schiaparelli or N.F.T.s. Recent and upcoming tours have been designed for drag queens, the crypto team at a venture capital firm, "Eloise-like" little girls with a fondness for dinosaurs, and a man who is blind.
Working her way through Dionysian art and decorative works, Louis XIV's stemware, and the occasional Bravo fan ("I just want to say that I loved the show!"), Ms. Firestone directed Mr. Stanley and Ms. Bes into the museum's largest room, where the Mona Lisa hangs on a wall across from "The Wedding Feast at Cana," an immense piece by the 16th-century artist Paolo Veronese that depicts Jesus Christ turning water into wine. "You can see wine tastings happening all over the painting," she said.
After lunch at the Ritz, which naturally featured cocktails and champagne, the itinerary called for the Musée d'Orsay. "The Louvre was a former palace, this is a former train station," Ms. Firestone said. She likes companion visits to the two museums, which, she said, help to show how art entered modernity by breaking from the monarchy, the church and the academy and spilling into the cafes of Paris.
"L'Absinthe" by Edgar Degas pictured what she called a "tapped out" woman with a glass of the infamous green spirit on a table before her. Nearby was a painting by Édouard Manet of the same woman (the actress Ellen Andrée), titled "Plum Brandy." Ms. Firestone prompted her clients to ponder the difference. "She's not nearly so sad or so schnockered here, right? She seems OK."
Paris, she said, had by then been transformed by Napoleon III's urban planner Georges-Eugène Haussmann, bringing with it grand department stores like Le Bon Marché and Samaritaine.
Ms. Firestone and Mr. Stanley met the next day at Samaritaine, where she had arranged for a cognac tasting and some shopping in the private apartments with a stylist. "Bonjour. How y'all doin'?" Mr. Stanley said, greeting the staff. "I'm not an aristocrat -- I'm just a cowboy!" He chose a pair of drawstring trousers by Maison Margiela.
Afterward, in a taxi, Ms. Firestone pointed at a Prada ad featuring Scarlett Johansson. "I think they're referencing that Man Ray photo of Kiki de Montparnasse," she said. "We like a good art-brand ref." She Googled the Man Ray photograph on her phone and held it up for Mr. Stanley to see, who said he felt like he had gotten a master class.
"Who doesn't love their hand held in Paris?" Ms. Firestone said.

A Big Dream Shifts Into Overdrive: [Correction]

Author: Friedman, Vanessa

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Of all the many Madonna-related posts that have appeared on social media since it was revealed that the artist had been taken ill and forced to postpone her "Celebration" tour, one in particular stood out -- not just because of what it said, but because of what it showed.
It was "M" herself, sitting conspiratorially at home with a pale bearded man -- the designer Guram Gvasalia of Vetements, the subversively indie brand that upended fashion in 2014 by elevating the anti-glamorous. Mr. Gvasalia, it turned out, had been secretly working with her for the last five months on the looks for "Celebration."
"Designing your costumes was such a privilege and honor," he wrote next to the picture, adding, "now I understand why you are who you are. You are a fighter, you are an icon, you are THE QUEEN."
If the timing seemed a little self-interested -- new dates for the tour have not yet been announced -- one thing was clear: Three decades after Madonna transformed the fortunes of another designer, Jean Paul Gaultier, via her "Blond Ambition" tour, the blockbuster that made Mr. Gaultier's cone bras into a symbol of sexual rebellion and his name forever a part of pop culture history, Mr. Gvasalia is hoping that even the appearance of her imprimatur may do the same for him.
"I think it gives you certain recognition and credibility," Mr. Gvasalia said of being chosen to work with Madonna. "When she can ask anyone in the world, and people will probably do it for free and be less complicated than I am, it gives you a certain security that you've done something right. It's really a blessing."
Certainly, if the tour happens, it will introduce Mr. Gvasalia, 37, to a much wider audience. He officially took over as creative director of Vetements only in late 2021, and before that was known primarily as the business partner and younger brother of Demna, the mononymic, much feted, latterly almost canceled designer of Balenciaga. (This despite the fact that the two brothers started Vetements together and Guram was as responsible as anyone for building it into a brand with 5.2 million Instagram followers and about 400 retailers worldwide.)
Along with the new Vetements collection, released digitally last week and featuring a bounty of grandiose proportions, the Madonna seal of approval may finally move him fully out of the shadow of his brother.
Though even there, his ambition, like his clothes, is outsize and impossible to miss. He did say he had made his trousers, puffers and skirts 16 times larger than normal in part because he was "trying to understand what is the maximum oversize I can make that still looks like clothes and you can wear but nobody else can make anything bigger."
Consider the Kardashians
History, not to mention literature, is rife with stories of sibling love and rivalry. It is one of our strongest, and most fraught, bonds. While fashion has had the occasional sibling partners -- Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen of the Row; Kate and Laura Mulleavy, who founded Rodarte; Dean and Dan Caten of Dsquared2 -- never before have two siblings who started together ended up quarterbacking fashion teams that are, if not exactly playing the same game, certainly aiming for a similar league.
"You guys really misunderstand how it is," Mr. Gvasalia said, referring to the fashion media. He was sitting on the terrace of the Aman hotel in New York, drinking a Coke and wearing big black boots with barnstormer platform treads, a white gold Cartier nail bracelet, two Cartier gold chain necklaces, a diamond wedding band, a Cartier panther ring and gold grills on his teeth.
"My brother is six years older. When I'm in the second grade, he's in the eighth. He got certain opportunities in life earlier. But if you consider where I am today, where my brother was when he was my age, I think I'm far more advanced."
Mr. Gvasalia tucked his hands through the giant rips in the thighs of his oversize black jeans as if they were pockets and took a breath. He can be charming and erudite and breathtakingly ego-centric, all at the same time.
"I give you the best example that everyone can relate to," he went on: "The Kardashians. You have Kim, who is a great person -- we think she's phenomenal -- and you have Kylie. Kylie's the young generation. She's been very successful without having sex tapes, without having to go through all the things that her sister had to go through. Another example is Venus and Serena Williams. They're both fantastic. But somehow there was a point where Serena managed to kind of take over.
"I think my brother is very talented, but I have a completely different approach to things. He had his good run of 10 years, and I think his era is slowly going to its finish line. Now it is my time."
Is that why he chose to post his Madonna reveal not long after the Balenciaga couture show?
"It's just the right time for us, after the momentum from our show," he said. Then he added, "Balenciaga always releases news on the day of our show, so I feel it's only fair." "Always" may be something of an exaggeration, though he did point out, "They announced Demna's appointment on my birthday." That was true (Oct. 7, 2015) though it's a long time to carry a grudge.
Sometimes it's hard not to wonder if Mr. Gvasalia knows what he is saying -- or how it may be received -- or if he is purposely trying to roil the pot. After all, said Julie Gilhart, chief development officer and president of Tomorrow Consulting, who started following Vetements not long after its debut: "There's nothing sloppy about Guram. I sat with him once in an airport lounge and saw the way his bag was organized -- it was perfect. Everything had a place. He never stops thinking. And he is very precise."
'It's not enough to be good. I need to be very good.'
Currently the two Gvasalias are trying to keep their public selves separate. Demna dropped his surname in late 2021. Guram said he would rather I not speak to his brother for this piece. When I requested comment from Demna anyway, he declined, via a spokeswoman, to respond.
Still, it's almost impossible to disentangle their stories.
Demna and Guram were born in Sokhumi, Georgia. When Guram was 7, civil war broke out and the family fled home, leaving everything behind. They spent a month lost in the mountains before eventually making their way to Düsseldorf, Germany, where the boys grew up. (In 2021, Guram told Forbes Georgia that if his family had stayed in Georgia, "I would probably be running for president.")
"They have a shared sense of survival that makes them very disciplined and resilient," said Jean Delmas, who, along with his partner, Heidi Yang, has been working with Guram as a sales agent for almost a decade.
Parental pressure dictated that Guram, like his brother, go to business school, but he also earned a master's degree at the London College of Fashion (he wrote his thesis on Martin Margiela), with after-school stints at Burberry and Selfridges. In 2012, he self-published a book called "Size Zero: A Guide to Spiritual Management" about "how you need to get rid of everything in your head and just listen to your heart." Two years later, he joined forces with his brother, who had been working at Margiela and Louis Vuitton, to start Vetements.
They decided to frame their new label as a "collective" because, Guram said, "we didn't want to put ourselves out there. It was always just about making the clothes and making what we felt was right." If pressed, they would say Demna was the creative one, and Guram the businessman.
"Everyone was kind of doing everything," Guram said. "You're a designer, a manager, a cleaning person; everything."
"No one really knew what was going on," Ms. Gilhart said. "But anyone who knew anything about the business knew Guram was a big part of it. He hears and sees everything."
Vetements detonated in the fashion world so effectively that in 2015, Demna was hired at Balenciaga. The next year, Guram
relocated to Zurich, along with the business -- a decision he said was less related to taxes than to the desire to get away from the fashion establishment. Zurich is German-speaking; German is one of the four languages he speaks fluently (the others are Georgian, Russian and English, though he is also pretty capable in French and Italian).
Demna and his husband soon followed, but by 2019, Demna announced he was leaving Vetements to focus his attention on Balenciaga; he has since left Zurich for Geneva.
"I find the world has for me completely different expectations than from everyone else," Guram said of the pressure he now feels. "The moment I do something, the bar is really super high. Because we changed the industry, because we were so shocking. And because my brother has a big name and has done a lot of things. Having him in my life puts more challenge on me. You know, it's not enough to be good. I need to be very good."
Lagerfeld dreams
According to Mr. Delmas, the move to designer was less of a leap for Mr. Gvasalia than the popular narrative may make it seem. "Even when Demna was there, Guram would edit the line," Mr. Delmas said. He would "add some pieces to what was in the showroom. He has a good idea of what is viable commercially."
Still, Mr. Gvasalia has begun to differentiate his Vetements, focusing more on tailoring and luxury fabrics. It is certainly priced like a luxury brand, with leather coats between $ 3,000- $ 10,000, and dresses that can run from a few thousand to more than $ 75,000. "The styling seems more involved, the fashion seems a little more high-concept," said Noah Johnson, the global style director of GQ, who said he was beginning to wonder if "maybe he was the mastermind of Vetements all along."
The most recent collection, Mr. Gvasalia's third, was rife with Easter eggs that reflect his dreams, goals and hangups. Alongside the acres of puddling denim paired with narrow corsetry and swaddling down were two very long, very Chanel-like coat dresses, shown over jeans, a nod to Karl Lagerfeld, whose longevity in fashion made him a role model for Mr. Gvasalia.
Also included: a choker necklace with an "M" at the front, a relic of his work with Madonna (she wore a similar necklace in an Instagram post in May). And a group of bell-shaped gowns with skirts six meters in diameter, integral gloves and face masks that, as Nicole Phelps wrote for Vogue Runway, bore a marked resemblance to the bell-shaped dresses Demna made for a Balenciaga show in 2019, spliced with the full-coverage bodysuit Balenciaga gown Kim Kardashian wore to the Met Gala in 2021.
"Those dresses, they're much, much smaller," Mr. Gvasalia said of the Balenciaga looks. "They have a completely different construction. And honestly, I think all the brands in the world have done these kinds of dresses. I also think if you look at them next to each other, ours are much better."
'There is still something coming.'
Mr. Gvasalia has spent the last five months hopping back and forth from his headquarters in Zurich to showrooms in Paris to New York, where Madonna is based.
In Zurich, he lives in a house on a lake just outside the city with his partner of almost 10 years, a Russian-raised entertainment mogul who asked to remain anonymous but has pitched in with the Vetements business so Mr. Gvasalia can concentrate more on the creative side. They also have an apartment on the Avenue George V in Paris, just across the street from the Four Seasons hotel (where his parents stay when they are in town) and up the street from the Balenciaga couture salons. They are, Mr. Gvasalia said, "perfect" together.
When Mr. Gvasalia comes to see Madonna in New York, he stays at the Aman. He does not collect art, but he does collect very high-end watches (Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet) as well as Hermès bags ("all in croc"); vintage Margiela, Gaultier and Montana; and nice cars. (His current ride of choice is a Rolls-Royce SUV.)
For years Mr. Gvasalia was very shy and refused to have his picture taken, Mr. Delmas said, but recently he has done something of an about-face, creating a public persona -- much as Karl Lagerfeld did -- that involves sweeping leathers with jutting shoulders and cinched waists, giant ripped black jeans, giant T-shirts, black shades and lots of jewelry.
He also acquired some custom-made grills from a dentist turned jeweler in New York whom he called the No. 1 grill person in the world. "He's from Israel but moved to New York and couldn't get his license," Mr. Gvasalia said. "He started to see rappers wearing the golden teeth, but the quality was horrible, so he said 'Oh, I'll make it properly for you.' He does grills for Pharrell, Madonna."
Mr. Gvasalia designed his to match his watches: a white and rose gold set to go with his white and rose gold Patek Nautilus. He likes the grills because they are not permanent, but, he said, "they add to the look, especially in summer, when you just have a T-shirt on."
During the January men's collections, show goers began noticing Mr. Gvasalia everywhere: in front rows and at clubs, in Daily Mail celebrity gossip columns holding hands with Avril Lavigne. He is friends with J Balvin, whom he met about a year ago when Mr. Balvin DM'd him on Instagram. Now, Mr. Balvin said, they text almost every day and "spend hours talking about fashion, watches, music and traveling -- gossiping."
Still, he often works until 5 or 6 in the morning, returning again at 10 a.m. His most recent show was the second most viewed spring 2024 men's collection on Voguerunway.com, coming in just after Vuitton and just before Prada. Mr. Gvasalia is, Vogue wrote, "on a roll." (Not long after, Beyoncé posted a photo of herself on Instagram in a pair of Vetements jeans.) According to Freddy Barassi, the vice president for men's wear at Ssense, it has stocked Vetements since 2015 and seen double-digit growth each season.
Next year will be Vetements' 10th anniversary. Mr. Gvasalia has plans. They are, characteristically, not small.
"Looking at people my age now, I'm not sure who is the competition," he said. "I had dinner yesterday with Sam Worthington. You know, the actor from 'Avatar.' I said, 'Sam, do you think you've had your biggest movie yet?' and he said, 'No, I think it's still coming.' And I feel for me, there is still something coming very big. I would not take a job today somewhere else. But one day if Chanel comes? I would not say no."

Full text: Blaming supply chains, inflation and changing weather patterns, the Wellington boot brand stumbled toward the brink of extinction this week. Can it be saved by a new (American) owner?
For decades, one fashion accessory was more synonymous with Britain's most famous music festival, Glastonbury, than any other: Hunter Wellington boots.
Paparazzi photographs of the likes of Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne and Alexa Chung wearing their Hunters in the early aughts propelled what were once functional footwear favorites of country life into cool style statements with broad global appeal. To many, Hunter -- which held a royal warrant, and was established in Edinburgh as the North British Rubber Company in 1856 -- became a brand as quintessentially British as afternoon tea, queuing and talking about the weather.
But this month, the week before this year's (uncharacteristically sun-soaked) Glastonbury got underway, Hunter was forced to file for administration, the British equivalent of bankruptcy, owing creditors about $ 146 million. Pandemic-related supply chain problems, Brexit and inflation all played their part. However the company largely blamed the dry-up in demand to unseasonably warm weather in its largest market: the United States. Online, however, some customers also aired their theories on what had gone wrong. Namely, that Hunter's offshoring of production to China had led to stumbles in quality control, resulting in split rubber and sodden toes. Today, prices for the tall rain boots start at around $ 175.
"Part of the Hunter magic was that they were built to last, and so were also built to become a part of your life," bemoaned Anna Murphy, fashion director of The Times of London, who said that she had spent the earnings from her first job on a pair. "They equated to permanence, to being in and of the land, and not just any old land but this particular one."
Similar to brands like Burberry and Barbour, Hunter capitalized heavily on its British roots when it sought to shake off a dowdy reputation and reinvent itself as a 21st century fashion powerhouse. Beyond their more recent adoption on the festival scene, Hunter wellies (as Wellington boots are affectionately known in Britain) were also a longtime mainstay of both working farmyards and aristocratic piles, worn by everyone from Princess Diana and Queen Elizabeth to those cleaning out the stables. For all their ever-increasing colors and styles, it was that tie to British life that held such considerable appeal to newer customers from Boston to Beijing.
"In America there has always been a sizable group of shoppers fueled by Anglophilia and a fascination with English lifestyle pursuits, particularly those of the upper classes," said Daisy Shaw-Ellis, accessories director at Vanity Fair. "People don't tend to walk across muddy fields in the drizzle for fun in America, they just get in their car and drive. But they also love that quintessential English country aesthetic, and the Hunter Wellington boot is a major symbol of that here."
Alasdhair Willis, who is married to the fashion designer Stella McCartney, served as Hunter's creative director between 2013 and 2020, and for a time the brand showed at London Fashion Week. But competition in the premium rubber boot business also grew stiffer, with niche brands like Le Chameau and Aigle as well as major fashion players like Prada and Balenciaga gaining ground as the latest social signifier to stomp in for those in the know. And when the United States had some of its warmest and driest winters on record in recent years, sales tumbled dramatically.
That said, Hunter now looks to be stepping toward a lifeline and a possible next chapter. A current statement on the company website, accompanied by the signature red white and black logo, reads: "We're creating a new experience for you. Sign up below to be notified when we launch!"
Hunter's intellectual property was sold to Authentic Brands Group and announced earlier this month. An American company, Authentic Brands also owns the rights to other once-beleaguered household-name brands like Brooks Brothers in the United States and Ted Baker in Britain in order to license them out to partners. Now, it believes it can breathe fresh life into Hunter.
"Our business is built on the premise that there are amazing brands that mean a lot to people that have been operating on inefficient or broken models for years, and Hunter falls into that camp," said Authentic's chief marketing officer and president, Nick Woodhouse. "But whatever country you are in, Hunter is the first name you think of when it comes to the Wellington boot, and that is so powerful. It is intrinsically and whimsically British, and we think exporting that around the world still has huge, untapped value."
An American partner, Marc Fisher, and European partner, the Batra group, have already been chosen to design and develop footwear and run wholesale and e-commerce operations in those territories. But if Hunter is no longer owned and based in Britain, can it retain authentic meaning and value in its story?
"Hunter is so close to the hearts of so many people and has so many positive associations, from Glastonbury to the late Queen," Mr. Woodhouse said. "But with all due respect, sometimes Britishness is better done outside Britain. We are not running away from Britain, and we have a big office in London. We are getting ready to bring Hunter, and ideas of what it means to be British, to a whole new group of consumers."

After 6 Months at the Gym, Finally Seeing Eye to Eye: [Society Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Six months after seeing Alexis Bittar at the gym, Jack Miner remained intentionally "aloof" toward him. Once the silence was broken, a relationship and a family followed.
A couple decades ago, the accessory designer Alexis Riyad Bittar, who had nearly a dozen tattoos at the time, added an especially meaningful one to the array: an image of a pair of thin wedding bands in navy blue ink, deliberately situated on the ring finger of his left hand.
"I got this in my 30s because I thought, 'I'm gay -- I'm never getting married,"' he said, pointing to the tattoo. "It wasn't legal."
Since then, of course, the laws around same-sex unions have changed, but until about five years ago, none of Mr. Bittar's relationships led to marriage. His life changed in other ways though: In 2015, Mr. Bittar, now 54, became a single father with the arrival of twins, Sophie and Ivan, who were born via surrogate.
One morning during the spring of 2018, Mr. Bittar, who is best known for creating vibrant Lucite jewelry, went to a branch of Blink Fitness not far from the Brooklyn Heights townhouse he's lived in since 2014, as he did most days.
He was accustomed to seeing the same set of recognizable faces there, but spotted someone new on the gym floor who stood out: John Cameron Miner, who had recently settled in Brooklyn after spending several years in Mexico City.
Mr. Miner, 34, who was working at the fashion brand Bode at the time, noticed Mr. Bittar, too.
"He's saying hi and he knows everyone," said Mr. Miner, who goes by Jack. He recalled thinking, "I'm not going to really give him much because he thinks he's pretty cool."'
Admittedly, the reaction was, in part, a reflection of Mr. Miner's personality.
"I can be quite guarded, just as a coping mechanism for the world," Mr. Miner said. "So I think that the sense that Alexis had was that I was a little bit aloof or something." He added, "It's not inaccurate. It's not that I wasn't interested, but I was not showing any interest."
For about six months, they saw each other during their morning workouts, but didn't speak or interact. That changed one day in November 2018, when, Mr. Bittar said, "for the first time, Jack gave me eye contact and acknowledged me." They chatted and made plans to meet outside of the gym.
A few days later, they got together for a late lunch at East One Coffee Roasters, which was around the corner from the Cobble Hill brownstone apartment where Mr. Miner was living at the time with his older brother Charlie, who is one of three siblings, and two friends. As they got to know one another -- "It was a little awkward because I'd been looking at him for six months," Mr. Bittar said -- Mr. Bittar explained that he was a single father.
"One of the first things he said was, 'I have twins," Mr. Miner said. "I remember saying, 'That's so cool.' I think some gay men might be scared of that, but I wasn't at all."
On the surface, the couple might seem quite different. Mr. Bittar, who is gregarious and vocal, grew up in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. His father, Robert Bittar, is of Syrian descent and his late mother, Helen Bittar, was of Irish-Catholic descent; both were professors. Mr. Bittar began selling jewelry on the streets of downtown Manhattan as a scrappy teenager.
Mr. Miner, who received a bachelor's degree in English literature from Bucknell University and is considerably more reserved, grew up in leafy Connecticut -- first Darien, then Fairfield. His father, Charles Miner III, is a doctor, and his mother, Claire Miner, is an interior designer. His first marriage ended in divorce.
"The differences are so obvious it's kind of ridiculous," said Todd Parmley, a software company executive who has known Mr. Bittar for more than two decades. "They are opposites."
Yet, as Mr. Bittar put it, "We're very different people -- like backgrounds, personality -- but our core values are the same."
On their second date, a neighborhood stroll toward Red Hook, Mr. Miner took Mr. Bittar's hand. "I know it sounds crazy, but I felt like, 'Wow, that really fit,"' Mr. Bittar said.
A relationship ensued, and in February 2019, it came time for Mr. Miner to meet Mr. Bittar's twins. He arrived with a gift: bear-shaped cookies he'd noticed at the counter of the coffee house where the couple had their first date.
"I used to think to myself, 'If and when I meet Sophie and Ivan, I'm going to bring them these little cookie bears,"' Mr. Miner said.
About a year later, with Covid in full swing, the couple and the twins left Brooklyn, first on a planned vacation to the Dominican Republic, then to a house in North Monmouth, Maine, where Mr. Bittar spent his childhood summers. During that period, Mr. Miner founded a clothing line, Interior, with Lily Miesmer, a close friend since eighth grade. In May 2021, they returned to Brooklyn, and Mr. Miner moved into the family home.
On the evening of June 1, 2021, as the children watched cartoons on television, Mr. Bittar presented Mr. Miner with a set of rings he designed, one for each of them. The sleek 18-karat matte gold bands, created to serve as both engagement and wedding rings, were made by Lori McLean, a fine jeweler and friend of Mr. Bittar's. With the bands in his hands, Mr. Bittar whispered in Mr. Miner's ear, "Will you marry me?"
Exactly two years later, on June 1, the couple was married by Michael McSweeney, the city clerk of the City of New York, at the chapel in the Brooklyn office of the city clerk. The location, the Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Municipal Building, is several blocks from the gym where they first met.
During the ceremony, the twins were by Mr. Bittar and Mr. Miner's sides, dressed in the sneakers and T-shirts they wore to school earlier that day. The image of Ms. Ginsburg on Ivan Bittar's T-shirt was a coincidence.
Mr. Bittar wore a beige Bottega Veneta suit. Mr. Miner wore a Prada shirt, Brunello Cucinelli blazer, and pants by Comme des Garcons, accessorized with a cotton baseball cap from the Leather Man, a shop on Christopher Street that carries items like fetish wear. He wore it, he said by text, "as a point of pride and remembrance for the gay men who came before me, who fought and struggled so I could have the opportunities I have today."
Afterward the couple and the twins took the C train into Manhattan for an early dinner at Grand Sichuan, a favorite restaurant in Chelsea, with Ms. Miesmer and Mr. Parmley, who were the couple's witnesses.
Two days later, on an unusually cool June day, the Bittars, as they are now known, gathered a couple dozen friends and family members for a second, symbolic ceremony at the Fairfield, Conn., home of Mr. Miner's parents. Strictly speaking, the event was hosted by the twins, whom Mr. Miner plans to adopt. Their handwritten invitations read: "Sophie and Ivan request the pleasure of your company at the wedding of Daddy and Jack."
The service, led by Mr. Parmley, included a section of Justice Anthony Kennedy's 2015 United States Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage.
Dinner was served afterward on the property's expansive lawn. There was salad, lasagna and a vanilla cake adorned with strawberries -- a nod to a similar dessert that was served at Mr. Miner's parents' wedding celebration at the house more than 40 years earlier.
Now married, the Bittars are preparing themselves for another change: The birth of a daughter, due next month via surrogate.
Alexis Bittar said, "I think there was a feeling, with Jack coming into the family, that the family would expand in a new iteration."

Full text: Lauren showed psychedelic tuxedos, Armani and Zegna stripped things down and Chris Pine made the rounds during a potent fashion season in Florence and Milan.
Concision -- that was the word to come to mind after eight surprising days in this men's wear capital, and in Florence. Did some unseen force take a blue pencil to all the slack narratives, rehashed inspirations, derivative references that prevailed in recent seasons? Suddenly everything seemed crisp and focused, like early Hemingway after he'd learned how to do Gertrude Stein.
Designers laboring for decades on narratives as schticky as the plot of an airport novel (we see you, Dolce & Gabbana) discovered urgency and a fresh approach in a tight edit. It must be freeing not to rewrite the same paragraph every season, even if the exigencies of an increasingly industrialized luxury goods market demand that designers repeat themselves.
What to do? You could follow the lead of Pierpaolo Piccioli at Valentino, showing his first men's wear collection in three years. The grouping of 56 looks was finely proportioned, but you'd expect as much from this fastidious designer. Shorts were worn under boxy jackets. Floppy collared shirts were paired with skinny ties. Guayabera-style shirts were embellished with paillette blossoms. There were ghostly boiler suits and drifty overcoats.
Not coincidentally, the significant design gesture was the designer's decision to emblazon some of the apparel and many accessories with text. The words he employed were drawn from Hanya Yanagihara's 2015 novel "A Little Life," a best seller replete with self-harm, childhood trauma, emotional mortification and rape. (Ms. Yanagihara is the editor in chief of T Magazine.) For undisclosed reasons, Mr. Piccioli bypassed the more Gothic elements of the fiction and settled on a phrase that renewed him and made him feel buoyant: "We are so old we have become young again."
Decontextualized and printed on jeans, outerwear and leather briefcases, the words could have easily tilted toward gimmickry, the stuff of refrigerator magnets. Instead you felt that the idea legitimately moved Mr. Piccioli, who wrote on his Instagram after the show that he longed to restore "the enchant and the eyes I had when I was dreaming to make this job." In a sense, the Valentino collection was a type of disclosure bordering on confession. Design and not red carpet stunts or global commercial domination is where Mr. Piccioli's story started. He'd like to return to that.
Probably the whole industry would. "Now, in this time, we have to inject fantasy, ideas," Miuccia Prada said immediately after her show on Sunday. It was not clear what made this time different from any other, unless perhaps the looming threat of artificial intelligence. By turns fantastical and pragmatic, the Prada collection was rich as always in her brand of intellectualized play. To begin with, there was a set made from industrial steel-plate floor panels, onto which from the ceiling oozed some substance resembling oobleck.
Between the curtains of slime paraded pretty robots dressed in tailored jackets with outsize shoulders, high-waisted shorts or ballooning trousers. The hourglass silhouettes called to mind Constructivist dolls. Ms. Prada and Raf Simons, her co-creative director, cited as one reference point the exaggeratedly manly proportions of men's suiting from the 1940s. Yet it was hardly necessary to go back that far. You could find those same proportions in nearly any Claude Montana men's wear collection of the late 1980s.
What the two designers added was a riff on those pneumatic period shapes, layering them with brightly colored utility vests, alternating the shorts with roomy jeans of a sort worn by the teenage speed freaks in Larry Clark's classic photobook "Tulsa," or else turning out commercially irresistible fringed floral shirts that would make anyone the hit of the Kiwanis bowling league.
If that makes the Prada show seem frivolous, it emphatically was not. Like most other designers here, Ms. Prada is uncommonly focused on upholding the legitimacy, if not primacy, of Italian design. People like the wildly underrated Walter Chiapponi at Tod's do so by producing coolly subdued collections that all but eliminate ornament.
Rather than pile on styling tricks, Mr. Chiapponi studiously whittled away at things extraneous to classic men's wear staples like windbreakers, chore coats, baseball jackets, trousers with inverted pleats and fingertip-length car coats until you could mistake the offerings for J.C. Penney basics. But of course that would be impossible because, in the manner of goods for the stealth-wealth set, the clothes were made of whisper-light woolens, finespun cotton, materials like doeskin or paper-thin suede.
It is a cardinal rule of conservation that, by the time a species is designated as endangered, it is probably too late for salvation. Almost the same can be said of skilled craftspeople, and that knowledge surely played a part in Silvia Venturini Fendi's decision to hold her show at a brand-new Fendi factory in Bagno a Ripoli, a Tuscan hamlet 30 minutes outside Florence.
Beforehand, the roughly 400 guests who had been bused or driven into the countryside were invited to wander a fully staffed factory as workers in white coats pantomimed slicing pristine calf-hide with a laser machine, piecing and stitching peekaboo bags.
"The idea of transparency in all aspects of our work is important," Ms. Fendi said in an interview. "People want to verify the sources of what they're buying -- the who, the what, the where." Presumably, at $ 3,000 for a classic Baguette, they already know the why.
Artisans, even those trained in advanced technology, are in scarce supply in Italy -- or anywhere else, for that matter. Publicly celebrating them, as Ms. Fendi did by bringing out her entire team after the show, is as much pragmatic as considerate. They are, after all, the unsung forces behind her vision of what could be called intersectional men's wear: sophisticated shirt aprons or net vests naturally dyed with the nettles that grow wild on the Tuscan hillsides; designs inspired by topstitched worker's aprons or tool belts repurposed as miniskirts and worn over trousers; clog slingbacks; articulated handbags created in collaboration with the Japanese architect Kengo Kuma.
Ms. Fendi's luxury is hardly the quiet kind. Neither are the designs produced for Ralph Lauren's Purple Label collection. Returning to show in Milan, after a four-year hiatus, the Lauren design team set up their presentation at Mr. Lauren's private palazzo, where guests like Chris Pine and Damson Idris ogled a rare Jaguar XK120 parked in the forecourt, sipped Champagne (or sparkling water, in Mr. Pine's case) and drifted among the potted palms.
Although the collection was divided into three passages, each squarely designed within Mr. Lauren's Gatsby idiom (a tailored denim suit was the outlier), one rewarding passage was the roomful of formal clothes in the raucous hues of a macaw.
Nontraditional evening wear is the fastest growing category in Mr. Lauren's Purple Label line, according to a spokesman. Given that the brand recently opened a 4,000-square-foot store along the luxury goods rialto of Miami's Design District, it's conceivable that all those dinner jackets in emerald green or canary; cerise trousers surprinted with vivid foliage; and double-breasted tangerine dinner jackets with wide peaked lapels are pitched toward that segment of the population of moneyed South Americans that has not yet decamped from South Florida for Madrid.
The two shows that closed Milan's fashion week were Giorgio Armani and Zegna. Each had as its core thesis revision and simplification. At Zegna, Alessandro Sartori, who trained in tailoring and bases everything on classical sartorial precepts, has gradually pared his style down to a kind of taut inevitability. Like a Raymond Carver story, his clothing has a clockwork geometry and logic. Unembellished to the point of plainness, it renders undetectable the complex processes of harvesting, weaving and fusing that go into its manufacture.
Mr. Armani is far from a minimalist, yet his style is typically under adaptation, what he termed "a constant process of writing and rewriting." Since 1975, Mr. Armani has steadily rung changes on a style he all but invented, with the result that he has things down to their essentials: unconstructed sports jackets that read as shirts, handsome field coats and cargo pants, blouse-y trousers and deeply cut vests worn over bare chests to create an effect of masculine décolletage.
On not a few occasions, Mr. Armani has been aimless, drifty or has fallen into the trap of sentimentalizing his own back pages. Somehow that is no longer the case. Finally, at 88, he has grown so old he has become young again.

Full text: In Milan, there's one unofficial but very important entertaining rule: Never throw a party on a Saturday night. Monday through Friday, the city is brimming with creative people -- the quiet engines running the design and fashion industries -- but, when the weekend rolls around, they tend to leave for the nearby Swiss Alps or the Mediterranean coast. Weekdays are when the Milanese gather and the aperitivo, a postwork, pre-dinner cocktail hour, defines the city's social life. "The Milanese are very busy," says the fashion designer Damir Doma, 42, a native of Croatia who was raised in Germany and has been living in the northern Italian city since 2016. "Aperitivo brings everyone together for a short moment to have a drink and a chat."
But for Doma, an aperitivo can also be a celebration. That was the case on a brisk Thursday evening earlier this year, when he invited friends and collaborators to his apartment in the vibrant Porta Nuova neighborhood to toast the success of his two-year-old label, Diomene. Many of the 30 or so guests are also members of what he calls his "Aperto" group -- a network who meet regularly for early evening events he organizes in local bars with his friend Stephanie Barth, a creative director.
Eight years ago, when Doma moved to Milan, he never imagined his social and professional lives would be so closely intertwined. He'd made the decision to relocate from Paris -- where he'd lived for nine years and founded his namesake brand in 2006 -- strictly for work. In Paris, he'd become one of the youngest and most closely watched designers on the fashion week schedule and his concept-driven collections and deconstructed garments had won him a global following. Moving to Italy, he figured, would allow him to collaborate more closely with the people who actually produced his clothes -- an aspect of the fashion industry he considered increasingly interesting. Today, his personal life is also firmly entrenched in Milan. He met his now-wife, Charlotte Rondeau-Doma, 37, in 2016 and the couple have two sons, Achilles, 5, and Balthus, 2. And he entered the next phase of his career in the city, launching Diomene in 2021, a year after closing his previous label amid the economic upheaval of the pandemic.
The new line is decidedly quieter and more considered than his first, made up of impeccably tailored shirting embellished with hand-stitched flowers inspired by traditional Croatian embroidery and boxy, padded jackets filled with recycled cashmere in lieu of goose down. "The goal is not to make something avant-garde, as I used to 15 years ago," he says. "Then, I really tried to push my own boundaries and the boundaries of what was actually wearable." Now, he says, he is more concerned with the quality and construction of a garment rather than how it might look on a runway.
In fact, when he first established the brand, he eschewed the runway completely. Instead, he'd invite friends and a few select buyers into his living room where, sipping prosecco, they'd thumb through racks of clothing, seeing the handsome craftsmanship up close and getting a feel for the technical fabrics that he and his team developed from scratch. This week, during Milan men's fashion week, Doma will finally inch back into the spotlight with a low-key presentation in an ex-industrial building close to Fondazione Prada, where he will launch the brand's third collection, as well as a collaboration with the Venetian footwear brand Marsèll. "The project is growing, and there's a limit to the amount of people I can invite to my house," he says.
Still, at this party, with just the inner circle on hand, there was plenty of room to spread out. Just before guests began to trickle in, the furniture designer Grace Prince arrived with a gift: a maple, soapstone and stainless-steel vase that Doma had commissioned for his wife's birthday and planned to surprise her with that night. Several others in attendance had befriended the couple through similar collaborations. The Jamaican-born artist Hugh Findletar, for instance, was in the process of making a Venetian-glass, wall-hung mask for the couple.
Early in the evening, guests mostly huddled in the dining room around the marble-topped Florence Knoll table, snacking on classic aperitivo fare -- including springy balls of fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced prosciutto and raw vegetables -- and sipping Negroni Sbagliatos that Maurizio Stochetto, the current owner of Bar Basso, where the Sbagliato was invented in the '70s, had swung by to mix for the group. Also on offer was a Ski Wasser cocktail, a tart mix of lemon juice, gin, seltzer and sweet raspberry syrup that the hosts often order après-ski while on holiday in the French alpine resort of Chamonix.
As the night wore on, the tapers flickering in splatter-painted candlesticks made by Doma's mother burned down, causing the half-filled cocktail glasses to shine with a rosy glow. Guests shifted between the living room, where they lounged on Doma's vintage Carlo Scarpa-designed sofa set, and the balcony, which overlooks the neighborhood's dense grid of Rationalist-style high-rises. The guiding logic of an aperitivo is that it never carries on too late. Guests usually filter out around 9 or 10 on their way to dinner reservations, with perhaps a handful sticking around a little longer. And such was the case that evening, with just a few close friends lingering until 11 to help clear plates, and the rest heading off into the night. Here, Doma shares his tips for hosting a classic Milanese aperitivo.
Send a No-Pressure Invite
To rally guests for their Aperto series, Doma and Barth simply notify the hundred-plus strong WhatsApp group dedicated to the event. "Everyone really enjoys the fact that it's so easy," he says. "You come, you don't come -- it's not a big deal."
Enlist the Experts
For their 2019 wedding in Geneva, Doma and Rondeau-Doma hired the team at Bar Basso to provide cocktails at the reception. Now, years later, the couple count the owner, Maurizio Stochetto, as a close friend. When they organize an aperitivo, he's been known to show up with a stocked bar, just for fun.
Keep the Kids Up
At several points in the evening, Doma and Rondeau-Doma's sons sneaked out of their beds to run laps around the party. The younger of the two somehow managed to outpace his parents, despite being confined in an animal-print sleep sack.
Make Some Merch
When hosting his regular Aperto nights, Doma often chooses artists to create what he calls "little souvenirs" that guests can purchase as a memento of the party. Past items have included collaged key chains and printed T-shirts. "It doesn't have to be complicated and shouldn't cost more than 40 or 50 euros," he says. "Everyone should be able to afford it."

MILAN — Concision was the word that came to mind after eight surprising days in this menswear capital, and in Florence. Did some unseen force take a blue pencil to all the slack narratives, rehashed inspirations, derivative references that prevailed in recent seasons? Suddenly everything seemed crisp and focused, like early Ernest Hemingway after he’d learned how to do Gertrude Stein.
Designers laboring for decades on narratives as schticky as the plot of an airport novel (we see you, Dolce & Gabbana) discovered urgency and a fresh approach in a tight edit. It must be freeing not to rewrite the same paragraph every season, even if the exigencies of an increasingly industrialized luxury goods market demand that designers repeat themselves.
What to do? You could follow the lead of Pierpaolo Piccioli at Valentino, showing his first menswear collection in three years. The grouping of 56 looks was finely proportioned, but you’d expect as much from this fastidious designer. Shorts were worn under boxy jackets. Floppy collared shirts were paired with skinny ties. Guayabera-style shirts were embellished with paillette blossoms. There were ghostly boiler suits and drifty overcoats.
Not coincidentally, the significant design gesture was the designer’s decision to emblazon some of the apparel and many accessories with text. The words he employed were drawn from Hanya Yanagihara’s 2015 novel “A Little Life ,” a bestseller replete with self-harm, childhood trauma, emotional mortification and rape. (Yanagihara is the editor-in-chief of T Magazine.) For undisclosed reasons, Piccioli bypassed the more Gothic elements of the fiction and settled on a phrase that renewed him and made him feel buoyant: “We are so old we have become young again.”
Decontextualized and printed on jeans, outerwear and leather briefcases, the words could have easily tilted toward gimmickry, the stuff of refrigerator magnets. Instead you felt that the idea legitimately moved Piccioli, who wrote on Instagram after the show that he longed to restore “the enchant and the eyes I had when I was dreaming to make this job.” In a sense, the Valentino collection was a type of disclosure bordering on confession. Design and not red carpet stunts or global commercial domination is where Piccioli’s story started. He’d like to return to that.
Probably the whole industry would. “Now, in this time, we have to inject fantasy, ideas,” Miuccia Prada said after her show Sunday. It was not clear what made this time different from any other, unless perhaps the looming threat of artificial intelligence. By turns fantastical and pragmatic, the Prada collection was rich as always in her brand of intellectualized play. To begin with, there was a set made from industrial steel-plate floor panels, onto which from the ceiling oozed some substance resembling oobleck.
Between the curtains of slime paraded pretty robots dressed in tailored jackets with outsize shoulders, high-waisted shorts or ballooning trousers. The hourglass silhouettes called to mind constructivist dolls. Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons, her co-creative director, cited as one reference point the exaggeratedly manly proportions of men’s suiting from the 1940s. Yet it was hardly necessary to go back that far. You could find those same proportions in nearly any Claude Montana menswear collection of the late 1980s.
What the two designers added was a riff on those pneumatic period shapes, layering them with brightly colored utility vests, alternating the shorts with roomy jeans of a sort worn by the teenage speed freaks in Larry Clark’s classic photobook “Tulsa,” or else turning out commercially irresistible fringed floral shirts that would make anyone the hit of the Kiwanis bowling league.
If that makes the Prada show seem frivolous, it emphatically was not. Like most other designers here, Miuccia Prada is uncommonly focused on upholding the legitimacy, if not primacy, of Italian design. People like the wildly underrated Walter Chiapponi at Tod’s do so by producing coolly subdued collections that all but eliminate ornament.
Rather than pile on styling tricks, Chiapponi studiously whittled away at things extraneous to classic menswear staples like windbreakers, chore coats, baseball jackets, trousers with inverted pleats and fingertip-length car coats until you could mistake the offerings for J.C. Penney basics. But of course that would be impossible because, in the manner of goods for the stealth-wealth set, the clothes were made of whisper-light woolens, finespun cotton, materials like doeskin or paper-thin suede.
It is a cardinal rule of conservation that, by the time a species is designated as endangered, it is probably too late for salvation. Almost the same can be said of skilled craftspeople, and that knowledge surely played a part in Silvia Venturini Fendi’s decision to hold her show at a brand-new Fendi factory in Bagno a Ripoli, a Tuscan hamlet 30 minutes outside Florence.
Beforehand, the roughly 400 guests who had been bused or driven into the countryside were invited to wander a fully staffed factory as workers in white coats pantomimed slicing pristine calf-hide with a laser machine, piecing and stitching peekaboo bags.
“The idea of transparency in all aspects of our work is important,” Silvia Fendi said in an interview. “People want to verify the sources of what they’re buying — the who, the what, the where.” Presumably, at $3,000 for a classic Baguette, they already know the why.
Artisans, even those trained in advanced technology, are in scarce supply in Italy — or anywhere else, for that matter. Publicly celebrating them, as Silvia Fendi did by bringing out her entire team after the show, is as much pragmatic as considerate. They are, after all, the unsung forces behind her vision of what could be called intersectional menswear: sophisticated shirt aprons or net vests naturally dyed with the nettles that grow wild on the Tuscan hillsides; designs inspired by topstitched worker’s aprons or tool belts repurposed as miniskirts and worn over trousers; clog slingbacks; articulated handbags created in collaboration with Japanese architect Kengo Kuma.
Silvia Fendi’s luxury is hardly the quiet kind. Neither are the designs produced for Ralph Lauren’s Purple Label collection. Returning to show in Milan, after a four-year hiatus, the Lauren design team set up their presentation at Lauren’s private palazzo, where guests like Chris Pine and Damson Idris ogled a rare Jaguar XK120 parked in the forecourt, sipped Champagne (or sparkling water, in Pine’s case) and drifted among the potted palms.
Although the collection was divided into three passages, each squarely designed within Lauren’s Gatsby idiom (a tailored denim suit was the outlier), one rewarding passage was the roomful of formal clothes in the raucous hues of a macaw.
Nontraditional eveningwear is the fastest-growing category in Lauren’s Purple Label line, according to a spokesperson. Given that the brand recently opened a 4,000-square-foot store along the luxury goods rialto of Miami’s Design District, it’s conceivable that all those dinner jackets in emerald green or canary; cerise trousers surprinted with vivid foliage; and double-breasted tangerine dinner jackets with wide peaked lapels are pitched toward that segment of the population of moneyed South Americans that has not yet decamped from South Florida for Madrid.
The two shows that closed Milan’s fashion week were Giorgio Armani and Zegna. Each had as its core thesis revision and simplification. At Zegna, Alessandro Sartori, who trained in tailoring and bases everything on classical sartorial precepts, has gradually pared his style down to a kind of taut inevitability. Like a Raymond Carver story, his clothing has a clockwork geometry and logic. Unembellished to the point of plainness, it renders undetectable the complex processes of harvesting, weaving and fusing that go into its manufacture.
Giorgio Armani is far from a minimalist, yet his style is typically under adaptation, what he termed “a constant process of writing and rewriting.” Since 1975, Armani has steadily rung changes on a style he all but invented, with the result that he has things down to their essentials: unconstructed sports jackets that read as shirts, handsome field coats and cargo pants, blouse-y trousers and deeply cut vests worn over bare chests to create an effect of masculine décolletage.
On not a few occasions, Armani has been aimless, drifty or has fallen into the trap of sentimentalizing his own back pages. Somehow that is no longer the case. Finally, at 88, he has grown so old he has become young again.

A High-End Handbag Smaller Than a Grain of Salt: [Style Desk]

Full text: The Microscopic Handbag by MSCHF takes the tiny-purse trend to the extreme. To see it, you'll need a microscope.
MSCHF, the creative collective responsible for the Big Red Boots that clomped across New York Fashion Week in February, is thinking smaller for its next accessory release. A lot smaller.
On Wednesday, the group plans to unveil its Microscopic Handbag, a specklike rendition of Louis Vuitton's OnTheGo tote. The bag measures 657 by 222 by 700 micrometers, making it smaller than a grain of sea salt and narrow enough to pass through the eye of a needle.
From afar, the fluorescent green bag looks like a radioactive poppy seed or a fragment of a sprinkle. Only when it is magnified are its translucent handles and Louis Vuitton monogram clearly visible. This is not the kind of tote bag that can be filled up with vegetables at the farmers' market: At most, it could be used to carry around a platelet or two.
Kevin Wiesner, the chief creative officer of MSCHF, positioned the bag as a commentary on the impracticality of ever-shrinking luxury handbags. "I think 'bag' is a funny object because it derives from something rigorously functional," he said in an interview. "But it has basically become jewelry."
He said that MSCHF aimed to extend that trend to its logical conclusion by stripping away all of the bag's utility, leaving nothing but a brand signifier. "It is the final word in bag miniaturization," MSCHF said in a statement.
The bag will be sold this month as a lot in Just Phriends, an auction organized by Sarah Andelman, the former creative director of the Paris boutique Colette, which closed in 2017, and Joopiter, the auction house founded by Pharrell Williams.
Mr. Wiesner said that MSCHF had not asked for permission to use Louis Vuitton's logo or design, despite the fact that Mr. Williams was recently named men's designer for the luxury brand. "We are big in the 'ask forgiveness, not permission' school," Mr. Wiesner said. (MSCHF settled a Nike lawsuit in 2021, and a Vans trademark suit is under appeal in federal court.)
But he noted that Mr. Williams had shown a fondness for oddly sized objects: "Pharrell loves big hats, so we made him an incredibly small bag."
This is all in keeping with MSCHF's history of provocative antics. Officially founded in Brooklyn in 2019 by Mr. Wiesner, Gabriel Whaley, Daniel Greenberg, Stephen Tetreault and Lukas Bentel, the collective has long leveraged parody and controversy to comment on the absurdities of consumer culture.
Its drops have included $ 76,000 "Birkinstock" sandals made from Birkin bags (released with the blessing of neither Birkenstock nor Hermès) and a pair of "Jesus Shoes," or customized Nike Air Max 97s containing holy water from the River Jordan.
If those projects allowed MSCHF to poke fun at sneaker culture and organized religion, the microscopic bag trains the brand's gimlet eye on the luxury handbag market.
When it comes to handbags, size matters. Consider the "ludicrously capacious" Burberry bag considered a faux pas in "Succession." Or the teensy Valentino tote that Lizzo carried from the American Music Awards red carpet into the meme stratosphere, or the buzzy micro bag that Jacquemus debuted at Paris Fashion Week in 2019.
And although luxury bags are considered desirable in part because some retain their value, new "it" bags are anointed at a dizzying pace -- from more minimal luxury offerings like Prada's mini Cleo and Bottega Veneta's "candy"-size Jodie to funkier statement bags like Puppets and Puppets' cookie bag and Simone Rocha's micro egg.
MSCHF had been discussing the idea of a miniature handbag for several months when Mr. Whaley brought the idea to Ms. Andelman during a visit to Paris. She jumped at the chance to offer a less obvious bag than the ones typically available at auction. "Christie's and Sotheby's, they have these Hermès bags," Ms. Andelman said. "It's become so usual, which is scary for me."
MSCHF approached several industrial manufacturers that specialize in biotechnology, which Mr. Wiesner said they found through a combination of asking around and Google. Many said no.
The whole process was an exercise in persuasion, Mr. Wiesner recalled, "because you're going into a production chain that makes stents and asking them to make a sculpture." Eventually, they got a yes from a manufacturer that he declined to name.
The bag was created out of resin through a process called two-photon polymerization, a kind of 3-D printing for microscopic objects. The OnTheGo style was chosen because its design -- a simple rectangle with a prominent logo -- could be reproduced legibly at such a small scale, Mr. Wiesner said. Its bright color and slight translucence are intended to make it more visible when lit from below on a microscope slide. (According to MSCHF, the bag will be sold in a sealed gel case premounted beneath a microscope with a digital display.)
When samples of the bag arrived a few months ago, they were so small that Mr. Wiesner said the team lost some of them. But at least one bag that survived will be on display later this month, affixed beneath its microscope, during Men's Fashion Week in Paris.
On June 19, it will be auctioned off online to a buyer who Mr. Wiesner hopes will not treat it with too much reverence. "I almost hope somebody eats it," he said.

Balenciaga's Uncanceling Strategy Is Working: [Style Desk]

Full text: At the Cannes Film Festival, the Met Gala and with a new collection. Is the world ready?
Demna, the mononymic designer of Balenciaga, that former harbinger of all things haute and cool that experienced a highly public fall from grace last winter, simply cannot resist a visual metaphor. His collections became famous as comments on the world around us and then infamous: He sent refugees trudging through a maelstrom after Russia invaded Ukraine; fetishized capitalism in the New York Stock Exchange; and then veered uncomfortably close to associating children with S&M when he posed a youngster amid adult "toys," reminding the watching world that those who thrive by the viral image risk dying by it.
So what does it say that his resort collection, released digitally on May 30, features a video of models emerging from the vaulted wooden doors of the Balenciaga headquarters on Avenue George V, walking back into the world in their shoulder pads, hoodies and beaded gowns, only to be doused by a sudden downpour?
Coming three days after the end of a Cannes Film Festival in which more Balenciaga appeared on the red carpet than it had since last November, the message is pretty clear: Balenciaga is in the midst of its comeback, baby.
Welcome to the next stage of The Return. Or, as Mosha Lundström Halbert called it on TikTok, the "Balenciagassance." If the Balenciaga powers that be can pull it off, they will have added a new chapter to the story of early 21st-century cancel culture, becoming not just a case study on mismanagement in a crisis, but one on how to strategize a recovery without the public defenestration of the decision makers involved.
As you may remember, the erstwhile hottest brand in the world fell into disrepute after a troika of events -- its close relationship with Ye before his turn toward public antisemitism and racism; and a pair of ad campaigns that viewers claimed promoted pedophilia -- had it teetering on the brink of disaster. Balenciaga products were burned on social media; Kim Kardashian condemned the choices; sales during the crucial holiday period dipped markedly. Even in a fashion world regularly troubled by problems with appropriation and offense, the situation was extreme.
Caught up in a whirlwind of public opprobrium, Demna and the brand's executives seemed unsure how to react, before finally offering up statements of public apologies and self-recrimination. Then, after what seemed like a self-imposed timeout, they came tiptoeing out of the shadows with a show in February: a stripped-down march of the penitents involving no sets or social commentary, just clothes.
But then came the Met Gala and Demna's first major public appearance, albeit one in a fashion safe space, where he hosted a table for young designers who could not afford their own tickets. Then came Cannes and the return of red carpet names to the fold.
It was clear that a master plan of sorts was unfolding. One that was tactical and considered and with some of fashion's most influential power players carefully pulling public strings.
Anna Wintour, for example, who very deliberately invited Demna to the Met and who has made something of a personal cause of second chances: masterminding John Galliano's return to fashion after he was fired from Dior thanks to a drug-and-alcohol-fueled antisemitic rant, as well as supporting Georgina Chapman after the crimes of her former husband, Harvey Weinstein, tarnished her brand, Marchesa. Indeed, Ms. Wintour said, she was "thrilled" to have Demna attend the Met, citing his "sincere" apologies and commitment "to making changes at the house.
"I've always thought part of owning up to one's mistakes is to not hide away, but to be honest -- and go out and face the world," she said.
Her embrace sent a signal to the rest of the fashion world, as did the fact that François-Henri Pinault, the billionaire chief executive of Kering, the luxury conglomerate that owns Balenciaga, wore a Balenciaga tuxedo to the Met rather than one of his many other brands, such as Saint Laurent, Gucci or Brioni. It was a public sign of his commitment to the brand and its designer.
Mr. Pinault doubled down on his support at Cannes, once again wearing Balenciaga "on purpose," he said. And it wasn't just Mr. Pinault: His wife, Salma Hayek Pinault, also wore Balenciaga, as did Michelle Yeoh, Isabelle Huppert, Alton Mason and the French singer Yseult, in red carpet images that would be captured and sent around the world, putting their brand equity where Balenciaga's was.
As to why, Cédric Charbit, Balenciaga's chief executive, said they were all wearing custom looks and "that happens through long-term relationships."
"It's not an overnight process, and it needs to be meaningful," he said. Suggesting, again, that the decisions were planned gestures of affirmation.
The chosen site seemed a carefully calibrated choice as well, given that an equally if not more controversial return -- that of Johnny Depp to the big screen -- also took place at Cannes, effectively paving the way. (Also, the brouhaha over Balenciaga had always been lower in Europe than it was in the United States, so it made sense to start the comeback there.)
Admittedly, when pictures of Ms. Yeoh and Co. in their Balenciagas appeared, there were a few social media comments taking them to task, but any negative reaction was far outweighed by the fire emojis. Overall, backlash was almost nonexistent. Diet Prada issued not a peep.
The outrage mob had, it seems, moved on. Luca Solca, a luxury goods market analyst, compared the Balenciaga situation to the Gucci "blackface difficulty" of 2019. "We have seen in the past that media mishaps have an impact for two to three quarters and then normalize," he said. He added that he expected Balenciaga to be "home and dry by the second half of 2023."
Now the question is whether Balenciaga can recapture the buzz and sales it generated before its crisis, a more complicated conjuring trick to pull off. It is one that requires the alchemical combination of products and desire that Demna once generated by upending all expectations and challenging stale ideas of "beauty" and "luxury."
While the cruise collection had some of that embedded within its signature oversize suits, puffer opera trenches and diva gowns -- "drawstring" bags that looked like the string bags used to tote grocery produce; "towel" wrap skirts that looked like bathroom towels -- such pieces no longer seem revolutionary. Like the ready-to-wear collection in March, they're familiar.
That's OK. As Hermès has proved, there is profit in consistency, if not excitement. And Demna can create truly gorgeous, sophisticated clothes, with the purity of line synonymous with the house. See one fan-pleated silk dress with winged sleeves that simultaneously suggests the body while framing it like a bas-relief. But the magic that was once there, that sense of gleeful, liberating, absurdist challenge?
That still hasn't come back.

Full text: The film festival, which took place over almost two weeks, brought lots of fashion to the French Riviera.
There has been a lot of head-turning fashion on the French Riviera lately. Though some of it was spotted on guests at the Monaco Grand Prix (hello Bad Bunny in torso-hugging Jean Paul Gaultier), much of it came from the Cannes Film Festival, which ended on Saturday.
As one might expect from a pack of A-list celebrities attending a star-studded festival in a particularly glamorous location, there were lots of gowns and tuxedos. But in contrast to the Oscars or other awards ceremonies, there were many daytime events at Cannes, which gave many festival attendees repeated chances to dress up and take style risks -- some of which were more successful than others.
There were a lot of outfits that caught our attention during the almost two-week festival, including Jennifer Lawrence's red Dior gown and flip-flops (most comfortable!); Naomi Campbell's Valentino dress and flowing pink feathered cape (most ethereal!); and the nearly identical tan linen blazers that David Zaslav, a media executive, and Graydon Carter, an editor, wore as co-hosts of a party for the Warner Bros. movie studio (most coordinated!).
But the 20 looks on this list stood out more than most. Some were unexpected, while others were flawless. All, importantly, drew strong opinions.
Helen Mirren: Most Blue Crush!
To match her cornflower-blue Del Core gown (and her nails), the actress wore blue streaks in her wavy silver hair, the colors of which recalled a frothing ocean.
Elle Fanning: Most Antique Silverware!
The actress's metallic Paco Rabanne dress was suspended by what looked suspiciously like a piece of cutlery and had a skirt that looked as though it could cut someone who came too close.
Fan Bingbing: Most Scenic!
Printed on the actress's Christopher Bu gown was a design featuring a roaring tiger in a bamboo forest that extended onto the dress's train.
Viola Davis: Most Volume!
A towering Afro and a colossal ostrich-feather stole punched up the actress's otherwise simple Valentino dress.
Troye Sivan: Most Negative Space!
The singer's ensemble of Valentino shorts, shoulder-baring shirt and tie advanced a new definition of business casual.
Ramata-Toulaye Sy: Most Power-Glam!
Amid the many penguin suits at Cannes, the director's wide-leg multicolor Chanel pantsuit was a sartorial unicorn.
Natalie Portman: Most Jackie O.!
In oversized cat-eye sunglasses and a belted Dior mini dress (and matching jacket), the actress brought a dose of the former first lady's style to La Croisette.
José Condessa, Jason Fernández and Manu Ríos: Most Triple Threat!
It seemed impossible that the trio of actors in "Strange Way of Life," a queer Western directed by Pedro Almodóvar, did not plan their three peek-a-boo Saint Laurent looks in advance.
Lily Gladstone: Most in Bloom!
An understated hairstyle toned down the drama of the actress's floral Valentino cape dress and three-tiered earrings by Jamie Okuma, a Native American designer.
Dua Lipa: Most Accesorized!
The singer paired her sleek, one-shoulder Celine dress with accessories that included jewelry, tattoos and her reported boyfriend, the filmmaker Romain Gavras.
Rawdah Mohamed: Most Smoldering!
The model set the carpet ablaze in a Robert Wun gown covered in what appeared to be burn marks. Over her head was a tattered veil that matched the distressed dress.
Lily-Rose Depp: Most Dressing-Her-Age!
Or almost her age: The 24-year-old actress's sequined Chanel mini dress is from 1994, making it a few years older than she.
Alton Mason: Most Snatched!
Look behind the model's gloved hands, and you will notice the hourglass silhouette of his double-breasted Balenciaga suit jacket, which was tapered sharply at the waist.
Scarlett Johansson: Most Trompe l'Oeil!
With a contrasting white top and straps, the actress's pink Prada sheath dress gave the illusion of an exposed bra.
Jennie Kim: Most 'I Do!'
The Blackpink member was a vision in white -- specifically, a Chanel bridal gown made (slightly) less sweet by black tulle poking out from the bodice.
Orlando Bloom: Most Painterly!
The green and blue streaks down the actor's pale Paul Smith suit were a risk -- as were the chunky soles on his matching shoes.
Ilona Chernobai: Most On Message!
As the Ukrainian influencer ascended the festival's red-carpeted stairs wearing a blue-and-yellow gown, the colors of the Ukrainian flag, she popped balloons filled with a red liquid on her head. Those who witnessed her fashion statement included security personnel, who escorted her off the carpet soon after.
Marion Cotillard: Most Coachella!
Her twee Chanel sweater set and pink bleached jorts were textbook festival style -- music festival style, that is.

Full text: Jeremy O. Harris celebrated art stars, while Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union showed up for Loewe.
Los Angeles is so consumed with celebrity that even some houses are famous. Take the Sheats-Goldstein residence, a co-star in films like "The Big Lebowski." Last Friday the e-commerce site Mytheresa leveraged its renown to fete the new Paula's Ibiza collection from Loewe, a beachy capsule the brand has released each summer since 2017. "This is the playful part of the brand," said Tiffany Hsu, Mytheresa's vice president for buying.
On the other coast, MoMA PS1 hosted its annual gala in the museum's front courtyard. Guests mingled over drinks and music by BombaYo, followed by a seated dinner punctuated with speeches by the evening's honorees: Robert Soros, a member of the museum's board of trustees, and the artists James Turrell, Daniel Lind-Ramos and Anicka Yi. A performance by the singer duendita signaled it was time for the after-party and for guests, including Solange Knowles, to dance into the early hours of the morning.
MoMA PS1 Annual Gala
'I wanted something that blurred the gender lines, and something that felt very free, flowy and that reflected my identity as an artist.' -- Jeffrey Meris
'I decided to wear this because it makes me feel very feminine and liberated, and it's my armor. I'm really a wallflower, but the armor that I put on makes me feel confident to move throughout spaces.' -- Friday Lynton
'I think a lot about being outdoors. I work on the High Line, so I spend a lot of time outdoors. I try to mimic nature.' -- Cecilia Alemani
'I just got rid of a lot of stuff, so I'm just really down to the things that I really feel good about wearing. Outfits have been coming together seamlessly.' -- Kalifa Diouf
'I feel like artists paint because they are telling a story. When I put on clothes, it's me telling a story to the world.' -- Matthew Kovalsky
Loewe Mytheresa
"I always tell Jennifer [Coolidge] that Jonathan Anderson is the Mike White of fashion. Like, he sees the bigger picture. He understands the greater vision and understands how to use this to tell the stories of our time." -- Evan Ross Katz
'Knowing Jonathan [Anderson], and how he respects the creative process, the clothing really is a manifestation of his hopes and dreams." -- Dan Levy

Russian Elites Still Obtaining Luxury Goods: [Foreign Desk]

Author: Troianovski, Anton; Ewing, Jack

Abstract: None available.

Full text: More than a year into Vladimir Putin's invasion, the web of global trade has adjusted to Western sanctions, with a network of middlemen sending cars, electronics and more to Russia.
On a dusty roadside on the outskirts of Dubai, Sohrab Fani is profiting from the West's response to the war in Ukraine: his shop installs seat heaters into cars being re-exported to Russia.
Twelve thousand heating pads languished in his warehouse for years, he said, until Russia's invasion and the resulting Western sanctions drove American, European and Japanese automakers out of the Russian market. Now, Russians import those cars via Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates -- and because cars shipped to the Middle East tend to be made for warm climates, accessories shops like Mr. Fani's are doing a brisk business outfitting them for winter weather.
"When the Russians came, I sold out," Mr. Fani said, so he ordered several thousand more seat-heating pads. "In Russia, they have sanctions. Here, there is not. Here, there is business."
More than a year into President Vladimir V. Putin's invasion, Western sanctions have damaged Russia's economy but not crippled it. The web of global trade has adjusted, allowing the Russian leader to largely deliver on a key promise: that the war would not drastically disrupt the lifestyle of consumption for Russian elites.
Russia is still importing coveted Western goods, enabled by a global network of middlemen.
In Moscow, the latest iPhones are available for same-day delivery for less than the retail price in Europe. Department stores still stock Gucci, Prada and Burberry. Car-sales sites list new Land Rovers, Audis and BMWs.
Just about all of the West's leading electronics, automobile and luxury brands announced last year that they were pulling out of Russia. Not all of their goods technically violate sanctions, but commerce with Russia became very difficult in the face of public outrage, pressure from employees, and restrictions on semiconductor exports and financial transactions.
Still, Russian demand for luxury items remains strong, and traders in Dubai and elsewhere are meeting it.
"The wealthy people always stay wealthy," said Ecaterina Condratiuc, the director of communications at a Dubai luxury car showroom who recently shipped a $ 300,000 Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT to a Russian dealership. The war, she added, "did not affect them."
In Dubai, buyers roam the showrooms of a sprawling auto market, haggling for Western cars -- the Dodge Ram is a recent favorite -- to purchase in cash and ship to Russia. Some are wealthy Russians buying vehicles for themselves, or small-time entrepreneurs looking to resell cars for a quick buck.
In other cases, Russian car dealerships, having lost their official affiliations with Western brands, are organizing their own imports, sometimes of hundreds of cars at a time.
The Russian analytics company Autostat reported that such indirect imports accounted for 12 percent of the 626,300 new passenger cars sold in Russia in 2022.
Electronics also take circuitous routes to the Russian market. In Dubai's old commercial neighborhood, Deira, electronics wholesalers have scrambled to recruit Russian-speaking staff.
"It's an open secret thing," said the owner of Bright Zone International General Trading L.L.C., a few storefronts down from a wholesaler of hair extensions. "Competition is very tough right now for Russia."
The owner, who requested that he only be identified by his last name, Tura, said he shipped hundreds of smartphones and laptops into Russia last year ahead of the holiday season. One potential buyer wanted a quote for 15,000 iPhones, Mr. Tura said, but apparently found a better deal elsewhere.
In another electronics shop nearby, an Afghan salesman, Abdullah Ahmadzai, said he had arrived in Dubai less than a year earlier, and had since learned enough Russian to negotiate with his Russian-speaking customers. Across the street, a man from Tajikistan, a former Soviet republic, said he and his colleague quickly found employment in a shop selling phones, laptops and drones.
"All the stores here are looking for people who speak Russian," he said. "We got lucky."
After many Western companies pulled out of Russia, Mr. Putin's government encouraged unauthorized imports of their goods from other countries. The Russian trade ministry published a list of dozens of companies whose products could be imported without their makers' consent, including Apple, Audi, Volvo and Yamaha.
"Whoever wants to bring in whatever luxury goods will be able to do it," Mr. Putin pledged last May.
One Russian report estimated that such "parallel imports" of laptops, tablets and smartphones totaled $ 1.5 billion last year. At the same time, Chinese cars and electronics have flooded onto the Russian market.
"You can bring over whatever you want, as long as you have money," said Pyotr Bakanov, an auto journalist based in Moscow. "Everyone who isn't lazy is bringing cars over."
The new trade routes largely pass through countries that have friendly relations with Moscow. Western analysts and officials have pointed to Turkey, China and former Soviet republics like Armenia and Kazakhstan as countries redirecting Western goods to Russia. They say that the Kremlin is taking advantage of those imports not just to mollify a populace used to foreign phones and cars, but also to source microchips for weapons used against Ukraine.
Mr. Bakanov, like other Russian car bloggers and journalists, has gotten into the business himself: he posts advertisements on the messaging app Telegram, offering to import cars "to order from any part of the world." He said that foreign car parts are also coming in via parallel import -- some are now available in Russia for lower prices than before the war, when those parts were sold by authorized dealers charging high premiums.
The workarounds have become so widespread that Russian car publications run regular reviews of cars made for foreign markets. The multimedia console in the Toyota Camry made for China only operates in Chinese, a popular auto website warned in February; the reviewer suggested holding a smartphone translating app up to the display.
In the Dubai car market one March evening, Sergei Kashkarov sat in the passenger seat of a parked gray Toyota, negotiating his latest deal: sending six Mitsubishi cars to a dealership in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk by ferry and truck, via Iran and Kazakhstan. Mr. Kashkarov had moved to Dubai from Siberia in 2021 and, after the invasion, established himself as a broker connecting Russian car dealers with Dubai suppliers.
"I've got plenty of work," he said. "I'm really not complaining."
The new trade patterns show up in international statistics; car exports from the European Union to Russia, for instance, dropped to about 1 billion euros in 2022, from 5 billion euros in 2021.
But E.U. exports to Kazakhstan rose nearly fourfold, to more than 700 million euros, and exports to the Emirates rose some 40 percent, to 2.4 billion euros. Armenia reports that its car imports more than quintupled to $ 712 million last year.
Western car companies generally deny knowledge of their cars going to Russia in any significant quantities, or of a spike in sales in the Emirates.
"We haven't seen any of that," said Jim Rowan, the chief executive of Volvo.
Paul Jacobson, the chief financial officer of General Motors, said, "I'm not aware of anything going to Russia."
Carmakers would have trouble tracking sales of vehicles through intermediaries, industry officials say. And U.S. officials responsible for enforcing restrictions have focused more on goods that can be used for military purposes.
The United Arab Emirates has been identified as a "country of focus" by U.S. officials for its role as a hub for products shipped to Russia in violation of sanctions. Electronics are of particular concern, officials say, because their chips can be repurposed for military use.
"The U.A.E. has strict measures in place governing import and export permits for dual-use materials to prevent their exploitation for military purposes," an Emirati official said in a statement.
Browsing in Dubai's auto market, a group of three men said they split their time between Russia and Armenia. They refused to say what they did for a living but they described the import and resale of cars as a lucrative side business; one said he had bought around 100 cars in the last year.
"Dubai is a three-in-one," a man who gave his name as Aik quipped. "You go on vacation, you buy a car for yourself, and you buy some to resell."

Muses Abound at the Met Gala Cocktail Party: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Nicole Kidman and her husband, Keith Urban, were among the first celebrities to arrive inside the Great Hall at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Monday for the Costume Institute benefit, honoring the designer Karl Lagerfeld. The couple was accompanied by Baz Luhrmann and his wife, Catherine Martin.
For the cameras, Ms. Kidman, with her long, strawberry blond locks, in a swath of peachy fabric, seemed to float toward Mr. Luhrmann's side, in front of a towering centerpiece featuring hundreds of one-liter plastic bottles sourced from a recycling plant.
The light of many flash bulbs reflected off the bottles, lighting Mr. Luhrmann's face as he fluffed Ms. Kidman's train, gesturing with his hands, softly, toward her face. Ms. Kidman, who starred in Mr. Luhrmann's films "Moulin Rouge!" and "Australia," poked her chin up, meeting the director's hand in midair.
The role of muse is one Ms. Kidman knows well: She was also one of Mr. Lagerfeld's muses, though she humbly deflected about the title when asked if she considered herself as such, preferring to talk about how much he taught her.
"I stood there, you know, in my lingerie while he designed my dress," Ms. Kidman said about Mr. Lagerfeld, who died in 2019 at 85, as she exited the exhibition and headed to the cocktail party in the American Wing of the museum. She clutched the train of her dress, designed by Mr. Lagerfeld for a Chanel No. 5 commercial Mr. Luhrmann directed. "Karl knew me and he was able to design for me, but he was also really playful and fun. It was just lovely in the same way as being around someone like Stanley Kubrick."
Supermodels like Kate Moss cherished the intimacy they shared with Mr. Lagerfeld. Ms. Moss recalled working with the designer, as well as his infamous largess.
"To sit at the desk with Karl Lagerfeld as he sketched was the most incredible thing," Ms. Moss said, as she entered the exhibit with her daughter, Lila Moss, wearing a Fendi dress. "He was so generous with his passion."
Naomi Campbell, who walked in Mr. Lagerfeld's runway shows and shot ad campaigns with him, also relished the bond she shared with Mr. Lagerfeld. As she walked through the exhibition, "Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty," her knee-length dark hair contrasted with the stark white walls.
"If I could describe our relationship, it was fun, witty, intelligent, never a dull moment, so creative, risk-taking and caring," she said, wearing a satin pink and silver Chanel dress from the 2010 couture collection. One thing she loved about Mr. Lagerfeld? "He was very honest: He did not suffer fools."
Ms. Campbell is proud of having been Mr. Lagerfeld's muse because it allowed her to watch him conceive an idea and bring it to life, she said.
"It is an honor to be a muse," Ms. Campbell said while a man holding a satin pink purse that matched her dress on a pillow stood several feet away. "It's an honor to be a part of, to watch something transpire and watch what it turns into."
Unlike Ms. Campbell, Gisele Bündchen, who wore archival Chanel from the 2007 bridal collection, has never considered herself a muse. She felt too tomboyish to see herself in that context, but she has muses of her own, she said.
"My muse is my mom and my grandma because they are incredible women who show me the values that carry me throughout my life," Ms. Bündchen said as she walked through the exhibit in a feathery white Chanel cape with a train that dragged a foot behind her and laid over a sequined white Chanel dress.
The Oscar-nominated actor Brian Tyree Henry said that he also considered his mother his muse. "My mother was my muse for most of my life, still is," said Mr. Henry, who wore a collaborative piece from the Karl Lagerfeld bridal collection. "She was one of the most fashionable people I ever saw. From her jewelry to her rings or shoes, I was enamored with everything that she picked and how she walked in this world."
The designer Tom Ford believes muses are important, even more so for male designers of women's clothes. "Oh my God, I have so many muses," Mr. Ford said as he walked past a row of waiters in white tuxedos and away from the bar, fizzy drink in hand. "I would say I have two main muses, Carine Roitfeld and Lisa Eisner. They represent very different sides of my own personal taste, and both were quite different."
While Mr. Ford can narrow it down to two women, the Nigerian singer Tems, who wore a feathered Robert Wun gown, said she finds creative inspiration in everyone.
"We gain inspiration from everybody -- it's a universal thing." Tems said, while chatting with Gabrielle Union, who wore a red Prada get-up. "We are all connected. You can see somebody right now, and then you gain inspiration from that. We are all muses in our own right, whether we know it or not."

NEW YORK — Officially, it’s the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute benefit, a black-tie extravaganza held the first Monday in May to raise money for the museum’s fashion wing. Unofficially, it’s the party of the year, the Oscars of the East Coast and “an ATM for the Met” (the last according to publicist Paul Wilmot). To understand the latter, consider that last year’s event raised $17.4 million.
The party signals the opening of the Costume Institute’s annual blockbuster show, and the party is usually themed to the exhibition. This year’s show is “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty,” an homage to the imagination and creativity of Lagerfeld, the longtime designer of Chanel, Fendi and his own line, who died in 2019 and helped shape (pun intended) not just the modern wardrobe, but the modern fashion world.
Guests were instructed to — surprise — dress “in honor of Karl.” And that meant a lot of Chanel, Fendi and Lagerfeld, as well as Chloé, Balmain and Patou (where Lagerfeld worked early in his career).

Full text: In sharing a role on the Showtime series, Juliette Lewis and Sophie Thatcher took cues from each other about never going for the obvious choice.
Juliette Lewis: I first met Sophie in a big office building in Burbank before we shot the pilot [for the TV series "Yellowjackets"]. We were both like, "Oh, it's you!" She plays a younger version of our character, Natalie, so she studied what I was doing, picking up my heaviness on set. The character is like a loaded weapon -- there's the possibility of danger at any time. Not every actor her age can make you feel that. I had that quality early on -- one thing I was recognized for because of "Natural Born Killers" [the 1994 film in which Lewis played a violent fugitive] was that I could scare you. Similarly, Sophie carries herself as a rare bird because she can't help it.
I was a closeted singer and dancer at her age. When I started making music at 30, it was hard to come back to acting. People were like, "No, you do music now." And I was like, "But I'm both." Today you can have an art show, write poetry, make music and then do your TV show. As with any young artist, it's up to her to get out of her own way and find what she wants to say.
My mistake was believing that I wasn't worthy, that I didn't belong here and that I should give up. Any of those themes can manifest in destructive behavior, and you'll have nothing at the end of that road. It's important to develop discipline in the form of self-preservation and self-care.
Sophie Thatcher: One piece of advice Juliette gave me was, "Finish the thought." I've always suffered from a voice in my head telling me not to complete the song, or that the self-tape is bad. It's so easy for me to fixate because I'm a perfectionist. I remember there being a change in me after I wrapped my first film, [the 2018 sci-fi movie] "Prospect." I went home with more self-confidence and saw the power of fully immersing yourself in a world. Everything felt like art to me.
I think it's important to rid yourself of walls that are created from fear of judgment and anxiety, to go with whatever feels right and do things that are unexpected. Juliette has helped me with that -- just watching her and seeing how she never goes for the obvious choice. Some people think the art and music I reference are too dark, but I'm trying not to worry about how others perceive me. There's a certain expectation for an actor to be a blank slate, but I'm not. I know what I'm into.
Interviews have been edited and condensed.

When in Doubt, Try Tweaking the Logo: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It's a classic move in the fashion playbook when trying to signal a new direction or herald a new designer. But are shifting sensibilities leading more brands to reconsider the humble serif?
Logos carry a peculiar, almost paradoxical burden of both inspiring loyalty and conveying novelty. A good design stands the test of time, while maintaining the allure of the new; too new, and it risks a sense of betrayal.
Consider the City of New York's recently announced, and widely panned, "We ❤️ NYC" logo, an update of "I ❤️ NY," the beloved Milton Glaser design created in 1976. High-profile logo redesigns often incite emotional uproars -- and increasingly, public discussions of the fashion of fonts.
When the British luxury brand Burberry introduced a new logo of its own last month, it seemed everyone in the fashion circuit had a hot take on typography trends.
Burberry joined two recently debuted serif logos from Ferragamo and Phoebe Philo, leading online followers to proclaim the era of serif typefaces in, and the era of "blanding" sans-serifs decidedly out.
For the uninitiated, serifs refer to the short marks, or "feet," at the ends of a letter's strokes (as seen in certain typefaces, such as the one used by The New York Times). A typeface that includes serifs is referred to as a serif, and one that does not, a sans-serif.
But for branding experts and design industry players whose daily work involves the detailed craft of custom typography and lettering, the hubbub was more a source of mild amusement.
"No one's really having the conversation about whether the logos are actually well drawn or not," said Grace Robinson-Leo, a founder and creative director at Decade, a branding studio that has consulted for Khaite, Banana Republic and Playboy.
According to Ellen Lupton, a design author and educator, the perceived binary of serif versus sans-serif is "really quite artificial" anyway. She noted that it "doesn't exist in most other writing systems that are not Latin based."
Michaël Amzalag, a founder of the art and design studio M/M Paris, described the fashion world's preoccupation between serifs and sans-serifs as "a dichotomy established decades ago, since the 1940s," pointing to the age-old rivals Chanel and Dior. His studio's brand identity for the Spanish luxury house Loewe has stayed in use for a decade -- a lifetime in internet years -- and notably bucks fashion industry trends by pairing two contrasting styles: a stately serif along with an ornate, script-style letter L.
Broadly speaking, serifs evoke "a certain historicism," said Michael Rock, a partner at the design consultancy 2x4, whose clients include Prada and Shanghai Tang. Serifs, as all typefaces, have always carried with them "the mark of a tool," he said.
Originating in the Latin alphabet, serifs date back to Roman antiquity, when inscribers would first sketch then carve letters into stone, Mr. Rock said. As a matter of function, the serifs were added as a so-called stop cut to prevent the longer strokes of letters from chipping out, he explained.
These classical forms have persisted as formal references in type design, even as technology progressed well beyond the days of chisel and stone. Sans-serifs emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as the industrial age and Modernist ideology inspired type designers to remove extraneous, ornamental vestiges of the past. Form follows function, as the adage goes, and serifs were thought to no longer serve a purpose.
"Now, we're in an age where everything is produced by digital means, and that difference between modernity and classicism is less ideological and more stylistic," Mr. Rock said. Still, the associations remain.
In the new serif logos of Ferragamo and Burberry, that subtle play for historicism may be key to winning back customer bases in an increasingly competitive landscape of newer brands. But at Daniel Lee's first show as Burberry's new designer, the new typeface -- an about-face from the brand's previous logo, a streamlined treatment created by Peter Saville less than five years ago -- took a back seat to the revival of the brand's turn-of-the-century equestrian knight design, a sort of heraldry that featured in a royal blue.
As abstracted, abbreviated signifiers, logos are but the tip of the iceberg for a large body of world-building creative work that forms a brand image, though they often attract outsize influence -- an influence that luxury fashion brands have in recent years used to steer controversy and buzz around an incoming creative director.
"Letter forms are the smallest containers for meaning," said Mathias Augustyniak, Mr. Amzalag's partner at M/M Paris, with typography offering the potential for a second layer of authorship. But the more common trend for publicity-driven redesigns, he suggested, are "more about creating noise than a true design act."
Fans of Ms. Philo, who led Celine from 2008 to 2018, still refer to Peter Miles's design of the "old Celine" logo -- which the brand's current creative director, Hedi Slimane, famously altered upon taking the reins, removing the accent over the E, among other adjustments recalling elements of the brand's 1960s logo. (Mr. Miles, who also created the mark for Ms. Philo's coming namesake brand, said of the serif-versus-sans-serif question: "Both have a place, both permanently current.")
Mr. Slimane also courted controversy during his tenure at Saint Laurent, where he dropped the Yves and replaced the previous word mark, created in 1961 by the French painter and typographer Cassandre, with a bold, all-caps sans-serif.
That, too, was an archival reference -- this time, to the original logo for the brand's ready-to-wear collection, Saint Laurent Rive Gauche, started in 1966. (The brand has since quietly reverted to a logo set in Cassandre's typeface, still absent the Yves, to form a mash-up that Mr. Amzalag referred to as "an amputation" akin to "cutting an arm off of Mona Lisa.")
In 2017, Mr. Saville, who established his career designing album artwork for Factory Records in the 1980s and is now a fashion-industry favorite for logo redesigns (including the latest one for Ferragamo), updated the Calvin Klein logo when Raf Simons took the helm.
Copycats exist throughout fashion, as a popular meme shows, listing examples of luxury brands -- Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Burberry, Berluti, Balmain -- whose logos had gone sans-serif within the past five to six years.
Starting a new label with a blank slate, however, the new Phoebe Philo logo designed by Mr. Miles, set in all-caps Times New Roman -- the familiar, default typeface of Microsoft Office -- breaks from the pack with a sort of rebellious indifference.
Mr. Rock described it as "a typographic version of a studied blankness, what in Italian might be called sprezzatura" -- a knowing and cool nonchalance belying a precise eye.
"Make no doubt about it, though," he said. "This takes enormous effort to achieve."
Ms. Robinson-Leo expressed an appreciation for the aesthetic created by Ms. Philo and Mr. Miles, though she said she could not quite put her finger on what exactly she admired about it. "When a logo is really beautiful and really well drawn, it really stands the test of time, and it often sets the tone for a kind of style or aesthetic that other people get excited about," she said.
The online hive has quieted its parsing of Burberry's new face, and it's too soon to know how it will fare over time. It's also possible that nobody will notice or remember.
"In the same way that social media is so immediate," Mr. Rock said, "it also has really short memories."

Full text: Miyoko Ito
Through April 15. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22 Street, Manhattan; 212-243-0200, matthewmarks.com
In 2018, the nonprofit Artists Space reacquainted New Yorkers with the Chicago painter Miyoko Ito (1918-1983), whose singular abstractions had mostly been held in Midwestern confidence. Five years after that rediscovery, her paintings are back in New York, at Matthew Marks, where 16 beautiful exercises of restrained carnality call for a silent pilgrimage.
Born in Berkeley, Calif., Ito had to abandon her education in 1942, when she was interned with other Japanese Americans at the Tanforan Assembly Center. She recommenced her studies after her release, but health troubles and family obligations prevented her from painting full-time until the 1970s. What she then made were structured abstractions of gently curved solids, pinstriped bands and rectangles rounded off at the top like gravestones.
Each painting is built up, layer by contrasting layer, and most suggest receding spaces, even classical landscapes, wholly unlike the flat forms of postwar American abstraction. Irregularly, Ito stopped short when hammering some canvases to the stretcher bars, letting the nails protrude like a marquee. Also irregular is her palette, a twilit, sublimely weird range whose best description might be adult. Muffled green. Muted magenta. Amber, but a little softer. Apricot, but a little darker.
Ito's colors are erotic, but also modest; they draw from Giorgio Morandi's dampened tones, they prefigure the ugly-chic palette of Miuccia Prada; but what on earth are their proper names? The green-gray of goose droppings. The fuchsia of the sky 10 minutes before sunset .... Ito's art has that speechless beauty that emerges only when, as Friedrich Schiller had it, "sensuality and reason, duty and inclination, are harmonized." JASON FARAGO
Winfred Rembert
Through April 22. Hauser & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, Manhattan; 212-794-4970, hauserwirth.com.
Born in rural Georgia and raised by a great-aunt, Winfred Rembert (1945-2021) suffered some of the cruelest traumas of the Jim Crow South. His childhood and years on a chain gang were spent picking cotton, which imprinted itself into his consciousness. At 21 years old, he survived a near-lynching, a horrific event that haunted him and echoed throughout his life's work.
The dyed and carved leather paintings, on view in his career survey "All of Me" at Hauser & Wirth, range from stories of injustice and violence to fond domestic scenes. In the first category are works like "Georgia Justice" (2015) or "Almost Me" (1997), which shows a Black man hanged by the neck from a tree. "Soda Shop" (2007) and "Jeff's Pool Room" (2003) show leisure and social scenes, and "Winfred Rembert Going North" (1997) depicts a car packed with luggage, and perhaps dreams.
One consistent motif in Rembert's work is the white dots that appear in many paintings. These culminate on the third floor in a series of paintings with swirling, rhythmic, seemingly abstract compositions. The works here seem joyful and celebratory -- until you lean in to examine one like "Mixed Rows (A Chain Gang)" (2013), and a darker tale emerges, of laboring men forced to pick cotton. Throughout the show, Rembert's story functions like that tiny white dot in a field of cotton: individual but part of a vast history of racialized violence and injustice in America. MARTHA SCHWENDENER
Martin Kippenberger
Through April 22. Skarstedt, 20 East 79th Street, Manhattan; 212-737-2060, skarstedt.com.
In the 1980s, a dashing young Martin Kippenberger filled his peers with envy; in the 1990s, bloated and tiresome, he attracted pity. The hard-living German painter died of liver cancer in 1997 at the age of 44. The rangy oeuvre he left behind jostles with his bad-boy legend -- as a man who (at least outwardly) dared to fail in public, his canvases unpredictable, often underwhelming, but sometimes unsettlingly fierce.
The eight paintings (1984-96) on view at Skarstedt on the occasion of what would have been the artist's 70th birthday have the ratio just about right. Half are brutal self-portraits, flirting with Picasso's or Schiele's idioms (or the tortured male form in general) in fits of painterly grandstanding and virtual self-abuse. The most idiosyncratic, "Nieder mit der Inflation" ("Down With Inflation"), from 1984, is a bisected composition based on photographs: On the left, Kippenberger pictured himself from the belly down, his pants (as they reportedly often were) around his ankles; on the right, an obscure and protean piece of orange exercise equipment seems mocking. It's the oldest piece here.
The only one to beat the show's fantastic blend of lust and resignation is the latest: "Dinosaurierei" ("Dinosaur Egg"), from 1996, centers a curled, infant longneck in the middle of an oblong shell, its vegetation-hued skin and bulbous eye garnished by hot, petal-like splotches of paint -- the image is womblike and gravelike at once; the membrane alive with veins yet split open, perhaps premature and failed, perhaps ready to deliver a miracle. TRAVIS DIEHL
Jake Berthot
Through April 15. Betty Cuningham Gallery, 15 Rivington Street, Manhattan; 212-242-2772; bettycuninghamgallery.com.
A New York City painter famed for his cerebral abstractions moves to the country and starts painting trees, which everyone considers an unforgivable betrayal. It's a funny cliché about the rigid boundaries of pictorial content, a reversal of the supposed progression of the artist, who's expected to get over sunsets and do something serious, like Cubism. Maybe Jake Berthot wasn't aware of the wisdom, or didn't care. His emotive, nearly monochromatic paintings of the 1970s both resisted Minimalism's incursions and softened them, remaining loyal to the modernist ideas of gesture and feeling, until he abandoned them for the landscapes of the Catskill Mountains.
Except Berthot's landscapes weren't really of the Catskills, or anywhere else. Where his early paintings, accounting for half of the 20 on view here, employed notched edges or central columns to shift their focus, inviting the eye to linger over a naturalistic palette of oxidized greens and rusted zinc, his late work (the other half, from 1996-2014) redoubled that strategy through multiple vanishing points, violating the concrete parameters of real space. These pictures wear nature like a feint -- loosely rendered fields whose loamy browns and ochers contain only the hint of a spectral birch or sunlight leaking over a ridge, their organizing grids left faintly visible, like a ghost -- a pastoral of the mind.
Berthot was a restive artist, and it's tempting to view the paintings he made toward the end of his life, as he dealt with illness, as vibrating between serenity and dread. But that would do his vision a disservice. He was grappling with the void from the start. MAX LAKIN
Rosalyn Drexler
Through April 15. Garth Greenan Gallery, 545 West 20th Street, Manhattan; 212-929-1351, garthgreenan.com
Thinking back on the postwar era when he emerged as a sculptor, Robert Morris said that the "great anxiety" was "to fall into the decorative, the feminine, the beautiful, in short, the minor." What he didn't mention: that almost all art by women was bound to be described by those adjectives, and dismissed.
That leaves me all the more astounded by the early work of Rosalyn Drexler, still working today at 96. Created in the years around 1960, the art in this show fearlessly trumpets its femaleness.
A wacky little sculpture called "Pink Winged Victory," not quite nine inches tall, seems to be a biomorphic, almost abstract riff on the figure of Nike from the Louvre, with the addition of a prominent vulva. "Fat Lady," a sculpture that's barely bigger, depicts its subject as a pair of spindly green-and-black striped legs with a big pink blob proudly sitting on top -- this, at a moment when plus-size women were hardly celebrated and when pinks and pastels were considered taboo in women's art, as the critic Lucy Lippard once recalled.
At Garth Greenan, a dozen tiny drawings done in brightly colored markers could almost pass as the work of an ebullient child, except that their subjects are frankly pornographic. In the sex acts depicted, Drexler seems to dwell on the woman's pleasure.
And yet, given that most of the objects here would barely crowd a night stand, it feels as though Drexler could not yet imagine her vision of empowered womanhood as something for full-scale public consumption. BLAKE GOPNIK

Ivan Bart Changed the Notion of What's Beautiful: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ivan Bart, who helped kick-start the careers of some of today's most recognizable models, has left his role as president of the agency IMG Models.
On the April cover of British Vogue, three models wearing dresses that hug their hourglass figures are described by three words: "The New Supers."
Those models -- Jill Kortleve, Precious Lee and Paloma Elsesser -- are represented by IMG Models, an agency that also represents Gigi and Bella Hadid. The models on the cover of British Vogue, all of whose careers may have once been hindered because they are not size zero, represent the agency's efforts to redefine who a supermodel can be.
Ivan Bart, 59, the president of IMG Models, has been an important part of those efforts. On Friday, he left that position for a role as senior adviser at the agency, according to a news release sent by its parent company, Endeavor.
"Ivan has quite literally changed the shape and face of the modeling industry," Mark Shapiro, the president of Endeavor, wrote in a statement to The New York Times. "We are honored that we will still continue to benefit from his vision in this next chapter."
Mr. Bart, who has worked at IMG Models for three decades, will not be replaced by another president. His departure is part of a series of organizational changes at Endeavor, which last year hired Susan Plagemann, a former chief business officer at Condé Nast, to run a newly formed division called WME Fashion. IMG Models, now part of that division, will be led by Jeni Rose and Kate Stirling.
Mr. Bart said that as part of his new role, he will continue to identify new models. "I want to keep finding great talent," he said.
More models these days can be short or curvy or middle-aged, and they can emerge from social media or reality television. Scouting talent has always been a part of the business, but when Mr. Bart came to IMG from Ford Models as an agent, in 1994, the industry was less inclusive.
In his early years at the agency, Mr. Bart worked with some of the most sought-after models at the time, including Carolyn Murphy and Stephanie Seymour. Though Mr. Bart was young, he was "a big thinker," Ms. Seymour said. "He had ambition for the girls."
"He was also incredibly personable," she added. "Someone you could trust, someone you could ask their opinion or tell a secret to."
Kyle Hagler, who worked at IMG Models from 1996 to 2014, said that Mr. Bart also took an interest in progressive causes within the industry. Mr. Hagler recalled how Mr. Bart attended a 2007 news conference hosted by Bethann Hardison, a former model and an agent, to call attention to the lack of racial diversity on runways and in advertising.
Ms. Hardison, who has also worked as a casting director, described Mr. Bart as "someone who always cared about the issues that I cared about."
In 2009, Chuck Bennett, then the president of IMG Models, left the agency. Mr. Bart was named its director, essentially replacing Mr. Bennett.
The model Martha Hunt, who had mostly posed for catalogs when she was introduced to Mr. Bart in 2012, said that meeting with him changed everything for her. "I went from doing catalog work to, overnight, walking for Prada and Chanel," Ms. Hunt said.
When IMG Models signed Gigi Hadid, in 2012, she was arguably best known for appearing on TV alongside her mother, who was then a star of "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills." Mr. Bart made some of her early introductions to fashion world players, including the editor Carine Roitfeld, whose magazine CR Fashion Book featured Gigi Hadid in 2014.
Mr. Bart was named president of IMG Models in 2014, after the agency was acquired by the entertainment conglomerate that owns WME. That year, after the closure of the plus-size division at Ford Models, IMG signed Ashley Graham and other plus-size models who had been dropped by Ford.
In 2017, Ms. Graham became the first plus-size model to appear on the covers of British Vogue and American Vogue. In 2018, she became a face of Revlon.
"Being the president of an agency that sells beauty is a tricky thing in these times, when beauty is loaded with political meaning and values," said Linda Wells, a former editor in chief of Allure, who was the chief creative officer at Revlon when the brand signed the deal with Ms. Graham. "It requires a different vision and awareness. Ivan really pushed that, and pushed that in a forceful way."
Mr. Bart further expanded the notion of who can be a model by supporting the careers of transgender models such as Hari Nef, who signed with IMG in 2015, and of Maye Musk, the mother of Elon Musk, who was 68 when she signed with the agency in 2016. Mr. Bart also gave his stamp of approval to Ella Emhoff, the stepdaughter of Vice President Kamala Harris, who signed with the agency a week after she attended President Biden's inauguration in 2021.

Should Helpers Suffer for an Artist's Sake?: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: Tom Sachs made an art career on casual shock value and relationships with luxury brands. Now he's under attack for what employees say was an abusive studio environment.
Tom Sachs, the downtown artist who has recently come to broader public attention over accusations of epically mistreating his studio assistants, first emerged as a creature of interest to high-rolling, mid-cult New York in 1994, when he built a crèche for Barneys Christmas windows and cast Hello Kitty in the role of Jesus. Outraged, Catholic groups placed hundreds of calls to the store, and the display was quickly removed. Still, it was a time when a calculatedly offensive expression, a tasteless gesture, did not signal the midnight of a career so much as the bright early morning.
By the 1990s, New York was no longer the center of the art world, and the influence of critics was long past a period of decline. Gallerists and curators, whose affinities had once been so entwined with the preoccupations of totemic intellectuals, now found themselves increasingly under the spell of the fashion world's mercurial vision. The era of Clement Greenberg, who had famously championed abstract expressionism for its resistance to the invasions of commerce, was long over, succeeded by a new age that brought a rapturous enthusiasm specifically to these intrusions of the market.
In this environment Tom Sachs found a trend-chasing audience for his cheeky banalities -- sculptures of fast-food meals wrapped in Hermès packaging, a toilet made out of Prada shoe boxes, a homemade gun with a Tiffany logo. For a 2002 group show about art and Nazism at the Jewish Museum, Mr. Sachs built what he described as a "pop up" concentration camp forged out of a Prada hat box.
When the writer Deborah Solomon asked him in an interview in The New York Times Magazine what any of this could possibly have to do with Hitler, Mr. Sachs responded that fashion was like "fascism" because it was about the "loss of identity." Fashion, he went on, "is good when it helps you to look sexy, but it's bad when it makes you feel stupid or fat," suggesting that the coercions of Harper's Bazaar existed on some continuum with the Gestapo's.
The notion that Mr. Sachs was critiquing the vulgarities of luxury consumerism, however mindlessly, was just pretense -- his own and one passed along by an obsequious fashion press. But the joke was always on us. He was finding his way into the firmament, moving pop art away from its origins as a means of cultural comment toward a newer language of collusion, a descendant of Warhol's, if we imagined that Warhol held the ambition to actually work for the Campbell Soup Company. In 2006, Fondazione Prada, a gallery space in Milan, held a Tom Sachs exhibition. Six years later, in 2012, he began his ongoing collaboration with Nike to make sneakers, a relationship that now may be jeopardized.
A man's hypocrisy never drives in a single lane. The trouble for Mr. Sachs began earlier this month, when a Curbed investigation outlined allegations of misconduct by more than a dozen former employees (most who chose to remain anonymous either because they had signed nondisclosure agreements or feared retaliation). They all described a workplace characterized by fear and humiliation. For a while now, Sachs has made big art that requires many hands -- spaceship replicas and so on -- and his management style has made as much a fetish of process as the work itself does.
Thirteen years ago, he released a short film called "Ten Bullets" meant to serve as an employee guidebook instructing staff on his many exacting rules -- keeping fit, answering orders with the words "I understand" or "I don't understand" -- which has a satirical charm until you realize that the sentiment behind it all is largely serious. In the Curbed article, former workers alleged that Mr. Sachs made sexist comments about women's bodies, lost his temper, kept vintage porn on the walls, threw things, called people "autistic" or "retarded" and made assistants tend to demeaning personal errands.
A week or so later, more allegations surfaced in a piece in Artnet News, among them, from a former assistant who said she had to pick up clothes from Chanel for Mr. Sachs's wife, Sarah Hoover -- whose Instagram page is a showcase of her life in Chanel -- and prepare meals for her French bulldog consisting of wild rabbit, spinach, aloe water and coconut oil. In response to that assertion, a studio spokesman told Artnet that assistants were in fact dispatched to make Napoleon's "veterinarian-prescribed meals." Neither did the studio deny that Mr. Sachs had once appeared in a Zoom call with Nike in his underwear; it did clarify that changing clothes was a feature of "weekly virtual fittings."
In a public statement made after the accusations surfaced, Nike said that it was "deeply concerned by the very serious allegations" around Mr. Sachs and that the company was "in contact with Tom and his studio, seeking to better understand the situation and how these issues are being addressed."
On Tuesday, Mr. Sachs sought to confront what had happened, sending a letter to his staff. Although he said that he "never tried to make anyone uncomfortable," he acknowledged that he could be "impulsive" and "even aggressive," that he was "a demanding boss" who always expects "the absolute best," but that the "recent representations" of him in the media did "not portray the totality" of his long career.
Some allegations were false or misleading, he wrote, and while he did not follow that up with any detail about what exactly was false or misleading, he said that he sincerely regretted having referred to a particular room in the studio housing an air compressor as the "rape room." He was working to "improve" himself and he was in the midst of formalizing "Human Resource policies" -- ignoring, perhaps, that the ostentatiously regimented corporatization of the studio was what had caused so much of the conflict in the first place.
For all the recent show that the art and fashion worlds have made of their progressive politics -- their efforts to market their alignment with inclusive causes -- they remain tied to caricatures of intemperate genius -- even when the genius itself is hard to locate. A brilliant artist reads beneath the culture, identifying the undercurrents the rest of us cannot easily recognize. What should we make of one who has managed to miss what is happening right on top, who has been blind to a tidal wave of shifting social norms?
Stories like this typically prompt circular conversations about how we ought to think about the great art of bad men. Here, the question seems a lot simpler. Mr. Sachs ended the letter to his team by saying that he remained devoted to "innovation" and "radical ideas." Was he ever?

The Men's Luxury Market Isn't What You Think: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In a floor-through loft in SoHo one Friday night in January, Vincent Ferraro was selling luxury clothing. Sort of.
On one side of the room, a tattoo artist covered a young woman's palm in an illustration of a bankroll. Some people flipped casually through the racks of Chrome Hearts and Enfants Riches Déprimés, but Mr. Ferraro -- sinewy, with a shaved head and covered in tattoos -- didn't pay them much mind. Instead, he poured shots of Patrón, posed for Instagram photos and occasionally disappeared with one of the several women who had come to vie for his attention.
On the men's resale clothing site Grailed, Mr. Ferraro, who before the pandemic worked in nightlife, most recently as general manager and creative director of Rose Bar at the Gramercy Park Hotel, sells under the handle 4GSELLER, and in the last couple of years, has become the go-to for rare Chrome Hearts, recent-season Louis Vuitton statement pieces and thrashed vintage dirtbag T-shirts, building a business that he says has annual revenue in the low seven figures.
"I did take, like, a big page out of what I did hospitality-wise and integrate it into what I'm doing," Mr. Ferraro, 32, said a few weeks before the party, relaxing in the showroom one afternoon in a Yankees fitted cap, white T-shirt and Louis Vuitton ski pants. On the couch next to him he had a small pile of new Chrome Hearts inventory, and one piece in particular stood out: heavyweight black leather cargo pants with exaggerated pockets and built-to-last hardware.
The pants had an original retail price, he said, of around $ 6,000 to $ 7,000, but he was planning on listing them for north of $ 20,000. "The guy who got these waited a year," he noted, referring to the sometimes lengthy wait for Chrome Hearts orders. "But people aren't coming here to wait a year. They're coming to walk out with them right now. So there's a value to that."
Still, $ 20,000 is a few mortgage payments, a diamond necklace, a painting, maybe a small car. Is there no sticker shock?
"I sold three of these already," he said, not even blinking.
Welcome to the wild world of men's luxury resale, which has begun to boom in recent years, owing in large part to the graduation of the young male customer who came of age in the era of limited-edition sneakers and Supreme items as asset classes, and for whom hip-hop icons and sports superstars are also high-fashion heroes.
All of those trends have primed the pump for the luxury men's resale market, which is broadening rapidly, a growth captured in sellers like Mr. Ferraro; Justin Reed, whose Los Angeles showroom has become a celebrity playpen; and Luke Fracher, something of a modern garmento, who recently opened Luke's, the first buy-sell-trade shop in New York for this generation of men's luxury clothing.
"We're seeing the streetwear-ification of high-end," Mr. Fracher said over dinner in January at Ludlow House in Manhattan, a few blocks from his narrow-corridor shop just north of Dimes Square. Which is to say that the category of current men's luxury isn't Loro Piana and Kiton, but rather Louis Vuitton and Balenciaga, Chrome Hearts and Rick Owens, rare Nikes and archival Raf Simons.
That evolution has been unfolding for more than a decade. There's an explicit through line from Riccardo Tisci's invigoration of Givenchy in the early 2010s to Alessandro Michele's psychedelic-tapestry rebrand of Gucci, to Kim Jones's streamlining of Dior to, of course, Virgil Abloh's up-from-spare-parts reconstruction of Louis Vuitton. And by remaking Nike and Vuitton simultaneously, Mr. Abloh implicitly linked their audiences, making clear that a luxury item is something people are willing to splurge on, regardless of which company made it.
Mr. Fracher, 34, was a founder of the Round Two empire, which during the 2010s turned the secondhand T-shirt trade into a multimillion-dollar concern with nine locations in five cities. He left Round Two last year and opened Luke's in December, betting that some of the customer base that cut its teeth on streetwear and sneakers would be ready to upgrade to something fancier.
He also pointed to how insatiable social media feeds have created persistent and renewable demand for luxury clothing. "First of all, it's the homogenization of how everyone dresses in every city across the world," he said, emphasizing how clothing has become a globally spoken language. "And then it's the need to flex nonstop and the need to have new clothing all the time, so you can post fit pics and get the dopamine hit and hopefully get some clout off it."
Because he buys his inventory outright and has little room for storage, Mr. Fracher wants to move product quickly, most likely leaving him with thinner margins than those of Mr. Ferraro or Mr. Reed, who operate as showrooms with online presence.
Mr. Reed's space, in a warehouse building in the downtown Los Angeles arts district, is bucolic and soothing, almost spalike. At the center of the main room sits a four-section de Sede Terrazza sofa from the early 1970s, still in its original beige leather, that he bought from a Hollywood producer. It's been a fixture on his Instagram for a few years, giving him a unique, sophisticated visual identity as his website, which he started in 2017, was getting on its feet.
Now Mr. Reed, 35, is one of the most trusted names in men's luxury resale. At his showroom, which during a December visit was decorated with a Givenchy surfboard, artwork by Joyce Pensato and a bench from the spring 2022 Louis Vuitton runway show, he entertains celebrity clients like the boxer Gervonta Davis, the Buffalo Bills wide receiver Stefon Diggs, the longtime fashion plate Luka Sabbat and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, point guard for the Oklahoma City Thunder, all memorialized in a wall of Polaroids. (Mr. Reed said that only about a quarter of his business comes from celebrity clients.)
Mr. Reed, in a St. John's hoodie -- his alma mater -- and Balenciaga Strike boots, described himself as "a self-taught street kid." Born and raised in New York, he sold photocopiers door to door before beginning to resell sneakers online in the mid-2010s. Once he began focusing on luxury men's items, he effectively helped make the marketplace thanks to a sleek web presence and a reputation for sourcing rare pieces. Last year, he sold one of the only known jackets by Pastelle, an early Kanye West brand, to Kim Kardashian. Like Mr. Ferraro, he does brisk trade in Chrome Hearts, especially odd, rare items like a leather case for jumper cables, or a weight bench.
Unlike Mr. Ferraro, he runs most of his business on consignment -- his 2022 revenue was approximately $ 8 million, he said, roughly doubling each year since 2019. His average website order is $ 1,300, he said, and around 100,000 people visit his site each month with almost no advertising.
Broadly speaking, hip-hop is to thank. Rappers began to embrace luxury fashion in the 1990s and 2000s just as the genre was muscling its way to the center of American pop music. By the 2000s, Kanye West and Pharrell Williams were deepening the ties between music and fashion, making way for the generation of ASAP Rocky and Tyler, the Creator, followed by Travis Scott and Playboi Carti. (This attitude has spilled over into professional sports, especially basketball and football, where players are now routinely filmed and photographed in the outfits they arrive at games wearing.)
In a way, high-fashion items have supplanted the rapper chain as the de rigueur splashy purchase. "You got to be dripped out to show people like, 'Hey, I'm here and I'm going to wear $ 10,000 jeans, drag 'em on the ground, and I'm going to make more money,"' Mr. Ferraro said.
By the mid-2010s, being a fan of hip-hop almost implicitly meant becoming a style aficionado, and starting to learn to dress the part. Around the same time, Grailed was introduced, formalizing a chaotic web of sales that mostly took place in online forums and building a true, transparent marketplace out of what had largely been hand-to-hand transactions. Furthermore, no longer did someone have to speak in the specific argot of forum loyalists in order to have access to rare product.
Arun Gupta, the co-founder and chief executive of Grailed -- which last year was acquired by the GOAT Group, which also owns the sneaker reseller Flight Club -- said that sales of luxury clothing had grown year over year, thanks to increased customer education.
"The level of knowledge has gone crazy," Mr. Gupta said. "The number of fashion brands that the average fashion person knows has probably 10x'd. Self-expression in the '90s was your CD collection, but in the 2020s, it's about your closet."
Before Grailed, to the extent that there was luxury resale for men's clothing at all, it was limited to consignment shops, like the one Ina Bernstein opened on Thompson Street in Manhattan in the early 1990s. Originally, she did not carry men's clothing in her namesake store. Eventually, some trickled in -- suits and ties, Armani and Calvin Klein, maybe a little Yohji. By the mid-1990s, she had opened a small men's-only storefront on Mott Street. Customers were dedicated, but scant. Men weren't quite ready. "It was very weird for them to think about trying on someone else's clothes," she said in a phone interview last month.
But the social conventions of male dress were on the verge of disruption. Soon, luxury houses were making more than officewear for men, and a wider swath of male consumers took an interest in expensive clothes. Ms. Bernstein's customer base widened accordingly, she said: "It's drastically changed. Many men who do not work in the fashion business, never went to art school. They're just walking-down-the-street men, and they all love fashion."
Even just a decade ago, the audience for some of the rarer men's luxury items was almost comically small. Alex Kasavin, before opening Idol in Brooklyn in 2014, resold niche high-end men's clothing, like Carol Christian Poell and early Rick Owens, through a showroom called the Gray Market beginning in 2012. "There was a time with those brands, for these key pieces, I would know almost every owner," Mr. Kasavin said. "There wasn't a whole generation that grew up on it. Now there is, and that generation has buying power."
It also has a robust understanding of how clothing in this category holds its value. "It's like buying stocks now," Mr. Gupta said, adding that expensive purchases now involve less risk because of the stability of the resale market.
This growing market is also attracting the attention of luxury brands and retailers. Mr. Reed said that he had been approached by larger fashion players interested in forming a partnership with him: "I think I can be the Barneys of the secondary market."
Mr. Ferraro, for his part, would rather remain niche. "I'm not trying to be, like, a $ 50 million business," he said. "I'm trying to stay genuine to the products." He sells across the modern luxury spectrum, including Saint Laurent and "Decarnin-era only" Balmain, but Chrome Hearts is his bread and butter and, in a way, his public persona. He is effectively a stand-in for his customer base, which includes rappers like Lil Tecca, rockers like Travis Barker, and athletes like Odell Beckham Jr. and Travis Kelce, who stopped by Mr. Ferraro's showroom not long after his Kansas City Chiefs won the Super Bowl last month.
"Tecca or Odell will come here, and we'll go out after," Mr. Ferraro said. "And then we'll come back here, and they'll buy clothes." He once was summoned to Offset and Cardi B's home on Father's Day to show Cardi some rare Chrome Hearts pieces. He has even sold vintage Chrome Hearts to Kristian Stark, scion of the brand's family.
But he's not precious, believing that even at these perilous prices, these garments are meant to be worn. The day before the interview, a handyman had been in the showroom doing some work. "We had the TaskRabbit in Chrome!" Mr. Ferraro exulted.
Mr. Fracher said that Mr. Ferraro's casual roisterousness was central to his appeal. "I knew Vincent from Rose Bar," Mr. Fracher said. "He used to comp us tables and bottles. He's a psycho like me. Vinny is, like, almost like a fashion house designer. Like, he reminds me of Hedi or Demna, in the sense that he built a lifestyle and then portrays it." (Nightlife is in Mr. Ferraro's blood -- one of his uncles is Ron Galella.)
Mr. Reed, on the other hand, is "like a jeweler," Mr. Fracher said. Of the three sellers, Mr. Reed's business is the biggest, and his attention to the market is finely detailed. He's made a few micro-markets in recent years, getting in early on the Chrome Hearts denim resurgence and selling some of the only Prada collaborations with Frank Ocean's luxury brand Homer that have hit the resale market.
What the ceiling for this luxury resale marketplace may be is yet to be determined. Clothes are increasingly detached from scene and subculture, so there are many more style propositions in demand at any given moment. But there's only so much product of this level being manufactured, and only some of it is in circulation at any given time.
"The athletes, the entertainers -- they hold, they don't want to sell," Mr. Reed said. "What I think they like is having a closet that's like a store."
Often, Mr. Reed and Mr. Fracher find themselves selling to other resellers in different cities, or with different clienteles. "Part of what keeps the market propped up is that so many people see what those guys are doing and want to do it," Mr. Kasavin said.
If Mr. Ferraro is a lifestyle ambassador and Mr. Reed is an asset manager, then Mr. Fracher is a yenta. A freewheeling presence on TikTok and Instagram, blending his thorough knowledge of the marketplace with a sense of wry exasperation, it sometimes feels as if he is advertising clothes by indicating how preposterous he finds them. To sit with him over a few afternoons of haggling is to become lightly unromantic about the purported exclusivity of luxury clothing. Expensive items, some rare, seemed to walk in out of nowhere.
"Luke is really the new Ina," Mr. Kasavin said.
Mr. Fracher traded two smallish Rick Owens jackets for a few Balenciaga pieces from a fashion hound wearing an early Vetements hoodie. One man tried to sell him the Enfants Riches Déprimés hoodie off his back, but couldn't agree on a price. Someone came in to offload a shirt from Yeezy Season 5. "No one is buying that," Mr. Fracher shrugged.
Seeing these expensive items treated so casually threatened to undermine the concept of luxury itself. If everyone is dressing up, then is anyone really dressing up? But it also suggested the true circularity of the marketplace, the scale of available supply, and the potential for endlessly renewable demand, even in the face of a possible recession.
Mr. Fracher is not overly preoccupied by these philosophical concerns, though. "I think as the real wealth gap keeps growing, more and more normal people are going to want to cosplay as rich people, and this is the easiest way to do so," he said. "I'll be here for them."

In Venezuela, Economy's Up, But Not for All: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: CARACAS, Venezuela -- In the capital, a store sells Prada purses and a 110-inch television for $ 115,000. Not far away, a Ferrari dealership has opened, while a new restaurant allows well-off diners to enjoy a meal seated atop a giant crane overlooking the city.
"When was the last time you did something for the first time?" the restaurant's host boomed over a microphone to excited customers as they sang along to a Coldplay song.
This is not Dubai or Tokyo, but Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, where a socialist revolution once promised equality and an end to the bourgeoisie.
Venezuela's economy imploded nearly a decade ago, prompting a huge outflow of migrants in one of worst crises in modern Latin American history. Now there are signs the country is settling into a new, disorienting normality, with everyday products easily available, poverty starting to lessen -- and surprising pockets of wealth arising.
That has left the socialist government of the authoritarian President Nicolás Maduro presiding over an improving economy as the opposition is struggling to unite and as the United States has scaled back oil sanctions that helped decimate the country's finances.
Conditions remain dire for a huge portion of the population, and while the hyperinflation that crippled the economy has moderated, prices still triple annually, among the worst rates in the world.
But with the government's ease of restrictions on the use of U.S. dollars to address Venezuela's economic collapse, business activity is returning to what was once the region's wealthiest nation.
As a result, Venezuela is increasingly a country of haves and have-nots, and one of the world's most unequal societies, according to Encovi, a respected national poll by the Institute of Economic and Social Research of the Andrés Bello Catholic University in Caracas.
Mr. Maduro has boasted that the economy grew by 15 percent last year over the previous year and that tax collections and exports also rose -- though some economists stress that the economy's growth is misleading because it followed years of huge declines.
For the first time in seven years, poverty is decreasing: Half of the nation lives in poverty, down from 65 percent in 2021, according to the Encovi poll.
But the survey also found that the wealthiest Venezuelans were 70 times richer than the poorest, putting the country on par with some countries in Africa that have the highest rates of inequality in the world.
And access to U.S. dollars is often limited to people with ties to the government or those involved in illicit businesses. A study last year by Transparency International, an anti-corruption watchdog, found that illegal businesses such as food, diesel, human and gas smuggling represented more than 20 percent of the Venezuelan economy.
Though parts of Caracas bustle with residents who can afford a growing array of imported goods, one in three children across Venezuela was suffering from malnutrition as of May 2022, according to the National Academy of Medicine.
Up to seven million Venezuelans have simply given up and abandoned their homeland since 2015, according to the United Nations.
And despite the Maduro administration's new slogan -- "Venezuela is fixed" -- many scrape by on the equivalent of only a few dollars a day, while public-sector employees have taken to the streets to protest low salaries.
"I have to do back flips," said María Rodríguez, 34, a medical lab analyst in Cumaná, a small city 250 miles east of the capital, explaining that, to pay for food and her daughter's school tuition, she relied on two jobs, a side business selling beauty products and money from her relatives.
Yrelys Jiménez, a preschool teacher in San Diego de los Altos, a half-hour drive south of Caracas, joked that her $ 10 monthly salary meant "food for today and hunger for tomorrow." (The restaurant that allows diners to eat 150 feet above the ground charges $ 140 a meal.)
Despite such hardship, Mr. Maduro, whose administration did not respond to requests for comment, has focused on promoting the country's rising economic indicators.
"It seems that the sick person recovers, stops, walks and runs," he said in a recent speech, comparing Venezuela with a suddenly cured hospital patient.
The United States' shifting strategy toward Venezuela has in part benefited his administration.
In November, after the Maduro administration agreed to restart talks with the opposition, the Biden administration issued Chevron an extendable six-month license to pump oil in Venezuela. The deal stipulates that the profits be used to pay off debts owed to Chevron by the Venezuelan government.
And while the United States still bans purchases from the state oil company, the country has increased black-market oil sales to China through Iran, energy experts said.
Mr. Maduro is also emerging from isolation in Latin America as a regional shift to the left has led to a thaw in relations. Colombia and Brazil, both led by recently elected leftist leaders, have restored diplomatic relations. Colombia's new president, Gustavo Petro, has been particularly warm to Mr. Maduro, meeting with him repeatedly and agreeing to a deal to import Venezuelan gas.
With presidential elections planned next year and the opposition's parallel government having recently disbanded, Mr. Maduro seems increasingly confident about his political future.
Last year's inflation rate of 234 percent ranks Venezuela second in the world, behind Sudan, but it pales in comparison to the hyperinflation seen in 2019, when the rate ballooned to 300,000 percent, according to the World Bank.
With production and prices up, Venezuela has also started to see an increase in revenues from oil, its key export. The country's production of nearly 700,000 barrels a day is higher than last year's, though it was twice as high in 2018 and four times as high in 2013, said Francisco J. Monaldi, a Latin America energy policy fellow at Rice University.
The Venezuelan government's loosening of restrictions on dollars has made it easier for some people to use money sent from abroad. In many cases, no cash is actually exchanged. Venezuelans with means increasingly use digital apps like Zelle to use dollars in accounts outside the country to pay for goods and services.
Still, U.S. officials call Venezuela's economic picture somewhat illusory.
"They were able to adjust to a lot of their problems after sanctions were implemented through dollarization," according to Mark A. Wells, a deputy assistant secretary of state, "and so it starts to look over time that they are able to reach a status that basically helps the elites there, but the poor are still very, very poor."
"So, it's not that everything is more stable and better there," Mr. Wells added.
Mr. Maduro took office nearly 10 years ago and was last elected in 2018 in a vote that was widely considered a sham and was disavowed by much of the international community.
The widespread belief that Mr. Maduro won fraudulently led the National Assembly to deem the presidency vacant and use a provision in the Constitution to name a new leader, Juan Guaidó, a former student leader. He was recognized by dozens of countries, including the United States, as Venezuela's legitimate ruler.
But as the figurehead of a parallel government that had oversight over frozen international financial accounts, he had no power within the country.
In December, the National Assembly ousted Mr. Guaidó and scrapped the interim government, a move some observers considered a boost to Mr. Maduro. A number of opposition figures have announced that they will run in a primary scheduled for October, even though many political analysts are skeptical that Mr. Maduro will allow a credible vote.
"What Maduro does have today is an opposition that is disjointed and dispersed," Mr. Guaidó said in an interview. "He also has a majority of the people against him. He continues being a dictator without popular support, a destroyed economy, which was his own fault, with professors, nurses, older people and workers protesting right now as we speak."
Even people like Eugenia Monsalves, who owns a medical supply company in Caracas and sends her two daughters to private schools, is frustrated with the country's direction.
Though she is upper middle class, she said she still had to watch how she spends her money.
She goes out to eat occasionally and has visited some of the city's new luxury stores, but without buying anything.
"The vast majority of Venezuelans live in a complicated situation, very complicated," she said.
Ms. Monsalves believes the Maduro administration needs to go, but she worries that the best candidates were forced into exile or disqualified. The opposition, she said, has not coalesced around what it most needs: a leader who can energize the electorate.
"That's what I most want, like many other Venezuelans," she said. "But the truth is that without a clear vision from the opposition, a clear platform from a single candidate, I think it's going to be hard."

CARACAS, Venezuela — In the capital, a store sells Prada purses and a 110-inch television for $115,000. Not far away, a Ferrari dealership has opened, while a new restaurant allows well-off diners to enjoy a meal seated atop a giant crane overlooking the city.

The country’s production of nearly 700,000 barrels a day is higher than last year’s, though it was twice as high in 2018 and four times as high in 2013, said Francisco J. Monaldi, a Latin America energy policy fellow at Rice University.
The Venezuelan government’s loosening of restrictions on dollars has made it easier for some people to use money sent from abroad. In many cases, no cash is actually exchanged. Venezuelans with means increasingly use digital apps like Zelle to use dollars in accounts outside the country to pay for goods and services.
Still, U.S. officials call Venezuela’s economic picture somewhat illusory.
“They were able to adjust to a lot of their problems after sanctions were implemented through dollarization,” according to Mark Wells, a deputy assistant secretary of state, “and so it starts to look over time that they are able to reach a status that basically helps the elites there, but the poor are still very, very poor.”
“So it’s not that everything is more stable and better there,” Wells added.
Maduro took office nearly 10 years ago and was last elected in 2018 in a vote that was widely considered a sham and was disavowed by much of the international community.
The widespread belief that Maduro won fraudulently led the National Assembly to deem the presidency vacant and use a provision in the Constitution to name a new leader, Juan Guaidó, a former student leader. He was recognized by dozens of countries, including the United States, as Venezuela’s legitimate ruler.
But as the figurehead of a parallel government that had oversight over frozen international financial accounts, he had no power within the country.
In December, the National Assembly ousted Guaidó and scrapped the interim government, a move some observers considered a boost to Maduro. A number of opposition figures have announced that they will run in a primary scheduled for October, even though many political analysts are skeptical that Maduro will allow a credible vote.
“What Maduro does have today is an opposition that is disjointed and dispersed,” Guaidó said in an interview. “He also has a majority of the people against him. He continues being a dictator without popular support, a destroyed economy, which was his own fault, with professors, nurses, older people and workers protesting right now as we speak.”
Even people like Eugenia Monsalves, who owns a medical supply company in Caracas and sends her two daughters to private schools, is frustrated with the country’s direction.
Although she is upper-middle class, she said she still had to watch how she spends her money.
She goes out to eat occasionally and has visited some of the city’s new luxury stores, but without buying anything.
“The vast majority of Venezuelans live in a complicated situation, very complicated,” she said.
Monsalves believes the Maduro administration needs to go, but she worries that the best candidates were forced into exile or disqualified. The opposition, she said, has not coalesced around what it most needs: a leader who can energize the electorate.
“That’s what I most want, like many other Venezuelans,” she said. “But the truth is that without a clear vision from the opposition, a clear platform from a single candidate, I think it’s going to be hard.”

Full text: Long, strong and bold, coats ruled the runways this season -- so much so that we're making our shopping list early.
The fall 2023 fashion shows finished up earlier this month, and after four cities and hundreds of collections, one thing was clear: There will be an abundance of long, statement-making coats available to buy ... in six months or so.
Yes, that's a long way away, and it may feel counterintuitive to think about new coats just when we're on the cusp of putting our winter wardrobes into storage. But while these things are fresh in our minds, we've pulled two dozen we found particularly special: Burberry's warm yellow trench, Proenza Schouler's thick checkered tweed, Chloé's striped stunner and, of course, a thick and shiny brown MaxMara, to name a few.
And if none of these are appealing, fear not: You can't go wrong with a big black coat, which many designers offered up in a variety of fabrics.
The Row's Cherry
Bottega Veneta's Double Take
Prada's Gray Lady
Loro Piana's Striped Poncho
Proenza Schouler's Soft Tweed
Burberry's Big Yellow Trench
Chloe's Curiosity
The Row's Soft Angular Dress Coat
Miu Miu's Collegiate Herringbone
Tod's Floor Skimmer
Fforme's Shape-shifter
Jil Sander's Cozy Hug
Loro Piana's Swinger
Loewe's Liquid Leather
Khaite's Tailored Shell
Alaïa's Cocoon
Partow's Two-Tone Trench
Stella McCartney's Street Sweeper
Tove's Abstract Canvas
Givenchy's Easy Glam
Dries Van Noten's Golden Ratio
MaxMara's Teddybear
Bottega Veneta's Snatched Waist
Prada's Toggle

Oscars Fashion Beyond Marketing: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "Everything Everywhere All at Once" may have been the big winner of the 95th Academy Awards, a vote by the industry for idiosyncrasy in the face of corporate moviemaking, but on the red -- whoops, sorry, champagne -- carpet, classicism ruled.
Its color may have changed, reportedly in an effort to inject some modernity into the arrivals/runway show portion of the evening (Oh, Jennifer Connelly, a Louis Vuitton ambassador, in Louis Vuitton? What a surprise!), but its ethos hasn't, that much.
Except ... except: Just as the triumph of "Everything" may offer a new way forward for filmmaking, a select few Oscar attendees eschewed predictability for some quirkier, more emotive choices, and in doing so added a touch of zest to the familiar old recipe. Rather than act as an advertising vehicle for a brand, they seemed more like co-conspirators, moving beyond the safety of promotion to expose some personal style. It's riskier (kind of like a movie about the multiverse featuring an everything bagel) but also more engaging to see.
There was Rihanna, for example, making her entrance fashionably late in a leather Alaia bra and long leather bandage skirt that opened and closed at the hips like some sort of super-glamorous armor, worn over a sheer body suit, the better to bare her pregnant belly. And that was just for openers. She changed into a Maison Margiela Art Deco-like silver beaded top and silver brocade pants to perform her nominated song "Lift Me Up," and then changed again, into a mint-green Bottega Veneta bias-cut silk skirt and matching stole, for afters: a play in pregnancy style in three acts and three brands where she -- and her stomach -- retained the starring role.
No one else swapped outfits with quite the same alacrity, but she wasn't the only one who brought some subversive attitude and private storytelling to the party.
Florence Pugh showed up in a Valentino strapless ocean of taffeta bedsheets with billowing sleeve-clouds attached to each elbow -- that parted in the center, like Moses, to reveal very abbreviated black bike shorts beneath, with a little pocket on the side for extra insouciance. (For anyone who remembers the Demi Moore self-designed bike short Oscar gown of 1989, this is the evolved version.)
Harry Shum Jr. got Adeam to custom-make him a white smoking jacket piped in midnight blue, wrapped in an obi-like belt to represent, he said -- after doing a little soft shoe shuffle -- "East meets West." Hong Chau, of "The Whale," asked Prada to add a mandarin collar to her shell pink gown to represent, she said, her roots. And Malala Yousafzai, an executive producer of the short film "Stranger at the Gate," in silver sequined Ralph Lauren with an integral hood/head scarf, demonstrated that high glamour and cultural values were not oppositional entities.
It was a reminder of the bigger context around these moments of shared pop culture escapism, which may also help explain the preponderance of white, by far the most popular color of the evening, and one that calls to mind fresh starts and peace, among other associations. (That's one way to read it anyway; "Navalny" did win for best documentary, and assorted attendees were wearing blue ribbons to stand #WithRefugees.) See Michelle Yeoh, whose precedent-setting best actress win will also make her swan-like Dior gown a part of Hollywood history, and, perhaps, usher in a new era. Also Mindy Kaling, in corseted Vera Wang, the boning exposed; Rooney Mara, wrapped in Alexander McQueen mist; Emily Blunt in a strapless Valentino column; and Paul Mescal in a Gucci white dinner jacket with extra-wide lapels.
In a show of true "I wore it first" power, Lady Gaga's Versace came straight from that brand's Los Angeles runway show the Thursday night before the Oscars, trumped in the statement-making stakes only by her expectation-defying and entirely nonbranded (nonbranded!) switcheroo into a washed-out black T-shirt and ripped jeans to perform. Meanwhile, Nicole Kidman's one-armed sequined Armani had asymmetric oompf, and Elizabeth Olsen's backless Givenchy offered a little slithery fringe as a finale. As for Danai Gurira, her Jason Wu gown was understated elegance incarnate.
Then there were the princess gowns: acres of tulle modeled by Sofia Carson in white Giambattista Valli, Stephanie Hsu in Valentino, and Halle Bailey in sea-foam green Dolce & Gabbana. Such fairy-tale frippery is an undeniable red carpet cliché, but at least when it came to Ms. Bailey, the look was also a clever nod to her role as Ariel, a.k.a. the Little Mermaid, in the upcoming film; a bit of strategic movie-marketing magic and a fashion double entendre that took the dress to a whole different level. (Also, let's be grateful for small favors: A princess gown trumps the even more tired cliché of a mermaid gown every time. At least the wearer can walk.)
The move that deserves the most applause, both from a personal style and point-making perspective, however, is the embrace of vintage. Ms. Mara's McQueen hailed from a 2008 collection; Winnie Harlow stepped out in Armani circa 2005; Vanessa Hudgens wore old Chanel; and Cate Blanchett appeared in a Louis Vuitton top with jutting shoulders that had been unearthed from the archives, paired with a bias-cut sustainable silk skirt for a serious Joan Crawford vibe.
If the awards show circuit has become in part a piece of promotional fashion content, this was a potent reminder that the attention paid to what everyone wears can actually be used for a higher purpose than just promoting new stuff. Unlike the decision to swap the carpet's color, the reworn looks actually made the de facto catwalk seem relevant.

Full text: I bought a sporty, stretchy, bone-colored dress in a mid-calf length for day wear. Now I find that in sunlight one can see through the dress. What is the underwear protocol for a sheer dress? How much skin should I show?
Joan, Wayland, Mass. Like so much else when it comes to dress these days, there is no longer a specific underwear protocol for what to wear under a sheer outfit -- only a variety of options. That's good news on one hand: It's great to have the freedom to make your own choices. On the other hand, it's stressful: Who needs so many more everyday decisions in their life?
Also, you have to consider how, exactly, the choices you make will be read by those around you. No matter how much we celebrate body positivity and the idea that being unafraid to show your skin is about owning it, there is no getting around the fact that there will be people who misconstrue what is on view.
How much you want to deal with that issue matters. So does context: Sheer on the street or among friends, for example, is going to be received differently than sheer in the office, where you probably don't want your clothes to distract from your points.
As I see it, there are four choices.
First, the most obvious -- and safest -- solution is to wear a knee-length slip underneath, a dress under the dress. That lets you be a bit provocative but without any real revelation. Then the question becomes do you emphasize that fact with, for example, a black slip, or do you go tone-on-tone or neutral by matching your skin, so the effect is sort of fake sheer? That's a little more challenging to those around you, often eliciting a sort of double take.
Second, you could take a cue from the nature of the dress itself and swap the slip for a sports bra and Lycra shorts. They would provide coverage and underscore the "sporty" aspect of the look. And if the dress is simple, the undergarments could also add layers of color, or even pattern, beneath.
Third, you could look to Miu Miu, where Miuccia Prada has been flirting with sheer looks on her runways for a few seasons now, often matched with underwear in similar shades to create a sense of depth. That demands a little more gumption but it's also very pretty and generally flattering. You do need to pick your undergarments with care; you can't throw on any old bra and pants combo.
Finally, you could ignore the bra altogether à la Florence Pugh, and just wear the dress with some briefs. That's how Anthony Vaccarello showed his sheer looks at Saint Laurent, though he also paired them with big jackets for a bit of coverage.
Still, as Ms. Pugh's experience with related internet commentary and controversy showed, if you go this route, you need to be ready for the response. Freeing the nipple is, even now, not exactly a simple choice.

Who Are You Wearing? For Costume Designers, the Answer May Be ‘Me.’

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Last year, their work transported audiences to Paris and to Graceland, to an underwater kingdom, to parallel dimensions with googly-eyed rocks and hot dog fingers — and to the decadent depths of 1920s Hollywood.
Throughout their careers, the five nominees for this year’s Oscar for costume design have dressed dozens of movie stars and entire armies of extras, collectively picking up eight Academy Awards along the way. So what happens when they turn their expert eyes inward and become the main characters for an evening?
“There’s a decision that we have to make: whether or not we go outside to a big fashion designer,” said Ruth E. Carter, speaking from Los Angeles a few days before the ceremony. “Or we say: We have the resources. We have the know-how. We have the ability to make beautiful fashions that we can actually adorn ourselves in and be comfortable in, and represent ourselves. So that’s what I’m doing. I’m representing myself.”
In 2019, Carter became the first Black designer to win the Oscar for costume design, taking home the award for “Black Panther.” This year, she is nominated for her work on the sequel, “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.” Carter said she planned to wear two outfits Sunday night, and that one of her looks — a white-toned dress with beadwork — was a tribute to Chadwick Boseman, the star of “Black Panther” who died from cancer in 2020.
“If I were to be thematic about who I am on the red carpet, I feel like I’m somebody real that represents Afro-future because of who I am,” she said. To realize her vision, she enlisted cutters Tamara Cobus and Rory Cunningham. (In the film world, a cutter makes patterns and cuts, fits and constructs garments based on a costume designer’s sketches.)
Jenny Beavan — who won the Oscar last year, for “Cruella” — and Mary Zophres went a similar route with their Oscars outfits, working with industry friends and collaborators to bring their own visions to life, dressing themselves as they might dress a character.
For Beavan, that meant using her Oscars ensemble to pay homage to the title character of her film, “Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,” and assuming an awards-season uniform of sorts. In the film, Mrs. Harris is a London house cleaner whose passion for a Dior dress takes her on a journey to Paris to buy a designer gown of her own. Beavan’s planned Oscars outfit, which she also wore to the BAFTAs and the Costume Designers Guild Awards, is “a homage to a cleaning lady” with a “nod to Dior,” she said, and was made by a friend, cutter Tim Perkins. It features a polka-dot pinafore and headband as well as a feather duster, which she “thought would be a fun accessory, to go around sort of dusting people down.”
Zophres, who is nominated for her work on “Babylon,” said that she planned to wear a dress of her own design, cut by José Bello. “This way, you’re never going to be wearing something that someone else is going to be on the carpet in,” Zophres said. She described her Oscars dress as a fuchsia pink, in a shade similar to that of a two-piece suit she wore to the nominees luncheon last month. “It’s a fun dress,” she said, adding that it was “danceable and energized.”
Shirley Kurata and Catherine Martin went in a different direction with their Oscars looks, ceding the reins to fashion designers.
In an email, Kurata said she planned to wear custom Rodarte. In studying Oscars looks through the years, she was especially drawn to a sequined Arnold Scaasi outfit that Barbra Streisand wore in 1969, and took that as inspiration for her own dress. Kurata added that her dress was hand-sewn and red, to nod to a “dominant color” in her film, “Everything Everywhere All at Once.”
“It is also a color in the Chinese culture that symbolizes luck, joy and happiness, which also mirror the feelings I have about the movie and my Oscar look,” she wrote.
In an interview, Martin said that she and her husband, director Baz Luhrmann, would wear Prada on Sunday. Martin, who is nominated for her work on “Elvis,” said that she loved the feeling of, “on a special occasion, not having to make my own outfit.”
“That feels like a treat, not work,” she said.
“As I’ve gotten older, I’ve got more and more comfortable with being part of the celebration and being happy to be at the dance with everyone else and less self-conscious — less feeling like I’m a backstage person and should just be wearing a black pantsuit,” Martin said. She added that she planned to wear two looks for the evening: an embellished print dress for the ceremony and a sequined pajama for the after-party.
“My theory about costumes is they’re all clothes,” she said. “However fanciful or removed from reality an outfit is, even in a movie, it still needs to be clothes. I think that costumes are clothes and clothes are costumes, and in a sense we costume ourselves every day.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Paris is a city of easy pleasures. Wine, cheese, croissants. What's not to love? Isn't that what Netflix built the popularity of the très unrealistic "Emily in Paris" on? Except the thing about Paris is that it seems like a foolproof place, but it's not. Rather, it is a city that rewards research.
Prioritize idiosyncratic shops. Paris is still the kind of place where you can stumble upon a boutique that sells only gloves or umbrellas. There is nothing better than being able to announce to anyone listening that you got some supple belt or slipper or lamp or toothpaste in Paris.
Definitely check on the hours that shops are open because they can be highly unusual from a New Yorker's perspective. Some require appointments, but don't be intimidated by that. Be enticed at the potential, the uniqueness, the fun.
Strategize your day by neighborhood groupings. In the morning, go to a few stores around, say, Place Vendôme, capped off with a lazy lunch and some of the all-time great people-watching at Hotel Costes. (A fun game: "Is that his daughter or his girlfriend?") If you're a real demon, move on to another neighborhood. Otherwise take a nap, then go to a small museum like Musée de la Chasse et de la Nature, which is like entering into a Wes Anderson film set.
Paris has many of the same designer boutiques as New York and other large cities, so you might skip them. However! Between the exchange rate and the VAT return (a.k.a., tax refund), designer goods can be significantly cheaper. You'll need your passport in store. At the airport, remember to scan the forms or have them stamped before you check in and go through customs, as sometimes they ask to see the goods in person. Basically, this is a crucial way to justify buying things.
Resee
This is an online consignment store, but you can make an appointment and send links of what you like, then try it all on at its showroom. Allow Matt, who runs the showroom, to bring you a coffee, and try on a Jil Sander paisley dress from when Raf Simons was the designer or an ivory Chanel jacket like the one in "The Devil Wears Prada" or a ruffled Prada blouse consigned by Catherine Deneuve.
Le Bon Marché
All grand (and less than grand) department stores owe their existences to this place. Émile Zola used it as the setting for "The Ladies Paradise," in 1883. Here's how I navigate it. I go to the lingerie-swimwear section. The Empreinte lingerie brand for large busts and plus sizes is hard to find in the United States but has the most comfortable and beautiful collections.
The second floor has a beauty section for niche brands, where you can buy hair masks and dental floss from brands you've never heard of. Then do a loop of the designer collections as an overview to see which ones speak to you. Go to, say, Dries Van Noten for an immersive experience. Go to the Buly counter for souvenirs, like a lip balm that comes in a box that can be embossed with initials. Buy snacks at the food hall across the street, which sells things like carrot-passion fruit jam and has at least three aisles dedicated to yogurt. Open Sundays!
Sabbia Rosa
If your ideal look is '90s off-duty supermodel, this is your heaven. There are exquisite but extremely expensive handmade slips here. Everything can be custom-made, which is dangerous. Do not skip the satin mule slippers with the bow.
Monoprix
Monoprix is basically the French equivalent of Target. The organic cotton underwear comes in a ribbed culotte -- a bikini style -- or culotte haute, which is more like granny panties. They're not dissimilar to the handmade underwear from Zimmerli or Hanro but around five euros. Stock up on Savon de Marseille hand soap and filet à provisions, those net market bags.
Em Archives
This new vintage showroom made a cameo in the Blackbird Spyplane newsletter. On a recent visit, it had at least one oversize Donna Karan blouse, an Hermès blazer, Comme des Garçons flats from 1997 and several pairs of Jil Sander trousers at extremely competitive prices.
Flea Market
There are several flea markets in Paris, but the largest is the Puces de Paris Saint-Ouen at the northern border of the city. The place is gigantic, so you absolutely need some kind of strategy. Choose a category (a friend had great luck looking for antique tablecloths) or pick one area to browse. The Marché Paul Bert Serpette is my favorite and has a mix of furniture and clothes.
Will you find a deal? Maybe. Will you want to buy a chair and ship it home? Absolutely! There are shipping companies on site, or just build it a box and check it as oversize luggage on a flight home. For something easier to take home, De Laurentis has late '80s and early '90s European and Japanese minimalist designer clothes, and Chantal has beaded flapper dresses reminiscent of the first Bode women's collection.
Charvet
Who doesn't want to authentically dress like Lydia Tár these days? This is a multistory palace of tailoring. Get the slippers, get a striped nightshirt that can be worn as a dress, maybe get a rosette brooch made out of necktie material. Then cross to the Hemingway Bar at the Ritz for a cocktail. It's sort of like the Bemelmans Bar of Paris.
La Tuile à Loup
Maybe its stern but direct Instagram bio says it all: "Finest of handmade tableware. MADE IN FRANCE. International shipping available." Do you want a vase with a jellyfish on it? Or how about a marbled tray? Maybe all you need to know is that Ina Garten was recently photographed there.

From City Hall To Consulting For Landlords: [National Desk]

Full text: Frank Carone, who stepped down as Mayor Eric Adams's chief of staff in December, has found work with two commercial real estate titans, including one seeking a casino.
As a candidate for mayor and since being elected, Eric Adams has appeared closely allied with New York City's influential real estate industry.
Major landlords have showered the mayor with donations. He has frequently met with real estate leaders and has used One Vanderbilt, one of the city's newest skyscrapers, as a backdrop for photo ops and news conferences. And as a small-time landlord, Mr. Adams once declared, "I am real estate."
Now his recently departed chief of staff, Frank Carone, who is expected to chair Mr. Adams's re-election campaign, is strengthening real estate's ties to the mayor's inner circle.
Since Mr. Carone left his job at the end of December as Mr. Adams's right-hand man, he has been busy building a consulting business whose clientele now includes two of the city's biggest landlords, and he may soon add a Saudi-based firm.
The Durst Organization, which controls several of New York City's marquee buildings, including One Bryant Park and Via 57 West, has hired Mr. Carone "to assist with business strategy," a Durst spokeswoman confirmed.
SL Green Realty Corporation, which developed One Vanderbilt and describes itself as the city's largest office landlord, has retained Mr. Carone to aid its bid to build a Caesars Palace casino in Times Square, an effort that is likely to require city support.
City law prohibits Mr. Carone from directly lobbying the mayor's office for one year, yet both companies stand to benefit from Mr. Carone's knowledge of the Adams administration's inner workings.
Mr. Carone, a longtime friend of the mayor, says his new firm, Oaktree Solutions, is broadly focused on global consulting and public affairs. He said in a statement released on Tuesday that he and his firm's employees would not lobby City Hall for one year, and that he would take the additional step, not required by law, of not lobbying any city agencies this year.
Even so, Mr. Carone's activities raise concerns that he could influence the mayor on behalf of Mr. Carone's new clients, underscoring fears that Mr. Adams is already too allied with real estate.
The real estate industry has long been considered the most politically influential in New York City, where space is limited and power flows to those who control it. Real estate barons contribute lavishly to mayoral campaigns and mayors' pet causes, hoping to gain access and consideration of their interests. Political leaders in New York have wavered on this relationship: Some on the left have refused to accept donations from real estate; Mr. Adams's predecessor, Bill de Blasio, also took an outwardly antagonistic stance toward the industry, but he, too, cultivated ties to certain real estate leaders.
Mr. Adams's close relationship to the industry is something of a reversion to the norm.
"This is all about public confidence," said Richard Briffault, a professor at Columbia Law School and the former chair of the New York City Conflicts of Interest Board. "He doesn't actually have to do anything improper for people to have a reasonable concern that there's something improper."
Mr. Carone's new career path, while potentially quite lucrative, is not particularly novel. A long line of city officials before him have left government and then cashed in on reputations newly burnished by proximity to power and the bureaucrats who operate the levers of government.
But the expectation that Mr. Carone will lead the mayor's re-election campaign raises a new raft of concerns for watchdogs.
"He's in a position to have private conversations with the mayor all the time about campaign contributions," said John Kaehny, the executive director of Reinvent Albany. "The potential for conflicts of interest is baked into that."
Fabien Levy, a spokesman for the mayor, said that outgoing senior officials are instructed about ethics rules in a process overseen by Brendan McGuire, the mayor's chief counsel, who "ensures all of our employees understand their ethical obligations."
After The New York Times began reporting this article, four separate public relations specialists reached out on behalf of Mr. Carone. But Mr. Carone declined an interview request and refused to answer specific questions.
"Frank worked for the city for one year, compared with decades as a successful lawyer and private sector leader," said David Meadvin, one of those publicists. "If this was about trading on his government service, he would've put his own name on the door and become a lobbyist. Frank's goals are much bigger than that."
Mr. Carone's appeal seems to extend beyond the real estate industry. Mr. Carone has told at least two associates that he is in talks with LIV Golf, a professional golf tour that has close ties to Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, just a year after he held at least two meetings at City Hall to discuss the Saudi-supported Aramco golf tournament at the Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point course in the Bronx. Mr. Carone has traveled to Saudi Arabia twice this year as part of his potential work there, according to a person who was familiar with the matter.
But the company would not confirm the talks.
"We are not aware of any discussions or relationship with Mr. Carone and LIV Golf," Jane MacNeille, a spokeswoman for LIV Golf, said.
Mr. Carone's yearlong stint as chief of staff granted the government neophyte unusual insight into both the workings of government and of industries that deal with City Hall.
As New York State was greenlighting up to three new casinos for the New York City area, gambling companies, breathless with excitement, descended on the mayor's chief of staff.
Las Vegas Sands's chief executive, Robert Goldstein, hosted Mr. Carone at his Upper East Side pied-à-terre, as The New York Times reported last year. And city lobbying records show Mr. Carone held meetings with the New York Mets owner, Steven A. Cohen, who wants to put a Hard Rock casino next to Citi Field, and Jeff Blau, the chief executive for Related Companies, the Hudson Yards developer looking to build a casino on the Far West Side of Manhattan.
Now, Mr. Carone is working for their competitor, SL Green, a hire first reported by Politico. A spokesman for the SL Green Caesars bid released a statement from Mr. Carone indicating that he would be helping to "create a diversified community engagement hiring plan as part of the proposal for a Times Square gaming destination," and would not be lobbying on its behalf.
The spokesman said the company was "very excited to be working with Frank to ensure that Caesars Palace Times Square maximizes job opportunities for underrepresented communities across all five boroughs of New York City."
A former Brooklyn Democratic Party lawyer and apparatchik with offices in Downtown Brooklyn, Mr. Carone used his year at City Hall to gain significant cachet. He now serves as the mayor's designee on the board of the Museum of Modern Art, alongside billionaires like Ronald S. Lauder and Leon Black.
He held meetings with the likes of the JPMorgan Chase chief executive, Jamie Dimon; the Goldman Sachs chief executive, David Solomon; and the chief executive of Northwell Health, Michael Dowling, according to Mr. Carone's schedules, which were released via a Freedom of Information Law request. Mr. Carone is now consulting for Northwell Health, according to Politico.
He has his eyes on a loftier perch -- metaphorically and practically. His firm is planning to sign a lease at 724 Fifth Avenue, a building across from Trump Tower that is home to Prada's flagship store, according to a person familiar with his plans. Mr. Carone had told Politico that he planned to occupy an entire floor at another building at 745 Fifth Avenue overlooking Central Park, but those plans fell through.
It is not clear how much money Mr. Carone stands to gain from his consulting work. But he has told at least two associates that his bills to clients will total about $ 25,000 a month. He also told those associates that his brother, Anthony Carone, will be joining the firm.
Mr. Carone's moves come as support grows for legislation to rein in city officials' post-government private-sector employment.
Lincoln Restler, a left-leaning City Council member in Brooklyn, introduced legislation this year aimed at ending the "revolving door" in city government by banning former high-ranking city officials from "appearing before" or lobbying any city agency for two years.
The bills could limit the activity of officials like Mr. Carone and Corey Johnson, the former City Council speaker, Mr. Restler said. Mr. Johnson works as a lobbyist for companies he once dealt with as speaker, including Vornado Realty Trust and Citi Bike. He declined to comment. Nineteen of the council's 51 members support the bill, including many from the Council's progressive caucus who have quarreled with Mr. Adams over school budget cuts and policing.
"When the most senior officials leave City Hall, they are permitted to lobby the people that reported to them the very next day, and it is insidious and wrong," Mr. Restler said in an interview, adding: "It gives the distinct impression that folks are in government service for themselves and not for the public good."
Lobbying is defined in New York City as attempting to influence specific activities, including the passage of a local law, procurements or zoning decisions, but many other consultants advise clients on strategy or communications.
Some of Mr. Carone's business dealings have drawn scrutiny, including his investment in an unorthodox police tool that Mr. Adams promoted as Brooklyn borough president. Mr. Carone has other friends in politics, including Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the powerful Democratic House minority leader whom Mr. Carone has said he plans to work with to take back control from Republicans.
Mr. Carone declined to provide the names of any new clients, but his spokesman, Mr. Meadvin, did offer a statement about his firm's vision, which is based on a 2020 book that listed Mr. Carone as a co-author: "Everyone Wins: How You Can Enhance and Optimize Business Relationships Just Like Ultra-Wealthy Entrepreneurs."
"Frank and his colleagues aim to help their clients solve complex problems with joy, value and understanding," he said.
Mr. Carone considers his year in government fruitful. He helped negotiate the New York City Football Club's stadium development plans in Queens and spearheaded the city's Democratic National Convention bid.
When Mr. Adams and Mr. Carone announced that D.N.C. bid last May, they avoided some of the city's most famous landmarks, instead choosing to host it on the 91st floor of One Vanderbilt. Its developer, SL Green, is now Mr. Carone's client.

What You Really Need Next Season is a Big Black Coat

PARIS — Paris Fashion Week, and with it the whole monthlong show circus, ended Tuesday just as one of the largest labor strikes of the year took place in France, halting transport and other services and causing chaos, to protest President Emmanuel Macron’s plans to raise the retirement age.
Editors — the ones who hadn’t already changed their departure reservations — scrambled out of the Miu Miu show, panicking about getting their planes home, even as Miuccia Prada’s visions of eccentric policy nerds in gray cardigans, horn-rim glasses and sheer pencil skirts that revealed the waists of pantyhose were dancing in their heads. Sometimes, under the dowdy sweaters, models wore only crystal-spangled briefs. Sometimes it was turtlenecks and hoodies under oversize jackets, sometimes 1950s-era halter-neck sheaths. Always, they tucked their handbags neatly into the crook of their arms, even when their hair looked like it was standing on end.
“I am thinking too much about what’s happening around us and how,” Prada said with a sigh, as her guests rushed for the exits. “But I can’t leave fashion like some place of nonsense. Basically, I think we have to dress for thinking, for doing things and so on.”
Or maybe half-dress, as if someone woke up with a brilliant idea, pulled on the clothes nearest at hand, was so excited she forgot the bottoms and then rushed out the door with serious bed-head to make it happen. Either way, she wasn’t just “dreaming about strange party fashions,” as Prada said.
It was a fitting end to the French collections, which had begun with Dior’s toned-down paean to the 1950s and Europe in the wake of World War II, a show that proved more prescient than anyone knew when they took their seats in the Tuileries on Day One. There’s a rigor in the air, and in the clothes; a quiet fierceness that is both protective and practical. Time to get on with things.
Remember that predicted explosion of excitement everyone thought was going to happen after the first period of pandemic social isolation? That burst of vitality and freedom that would involve color! And sequins! And ruffles!? That period of the 2020s that was supposed to mirror the 1920s, full of Champagne and dancing on tables; that period that was just starting? Well, it got cut short by the war in Ukraine.
We’ve fast-forwarded, reference-wise, to the post-WWII era now, at least in fashion (not, obviously, in reality, although perhaps the clothes are actually a gesture of belief that we’ll get there soon, maybe by the time they end up in stores): buck up and buckle down. History compressed by current events into a few style cycles.
Frivolity is out; austerity and formality is in. (This is part of the ubiquitous new emphasis on wearability, intimacy.) Arms clutched around the torso is the defining gesture. The black overcoat — broad shoulders, hems brushing the ankles or even the floor, expansive enough to double as a place of refuge, but also tough — is the defining garment. Most often worn with a cavernous handbag and an interesting shoe. See the Row, where Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen offered enveloping double-breasted styles with a scarflike panel emerging from the side, like an extra fillip of care, as “Bela Lugosi’s Dead,” a goth-rock song by The Bauhaus, played in the background.
Road Warriors and Camellias
That’s why the Chanel show, an ode to the camellia, struck such an off note. Two giant camellias — a key part of the brand semiology and the base note of its fragrance Chanel No. 1 — had been built in the show space, and around them swirled the models in camellia-speckled everything.
There were camellias woven into the tweed of a soft-shoulder day coat; camellias clustered around the neckline of a leather jacket; camellias as a corsage on a white T-shirt over a striped undershirt and sequin jeans; camellias polka-dotted over knitwear; camellias embossed on ’70s-style boots. The colors caught the general mood, and there were some lovely airy pieces (designer Virginie Viard is best when she isn’t trying for cool), but then the collection overdosed on camellias.
The only other item as present (besides the brand’s signature tweed bouclé) was shorts. Bermuda shorts, biker shorts and long bloomer shorts; shorts worn as part of a suit, often over white lace tights with those boots. Combined with the camellias, they looked sort of like a perfume ad for the out-of-touch.
On the other hand, when Junya Watanabe’s road warriors arrived wearing gas masks dripping in delicate gold chains and glorious pastiches of motorcycle and trench coats, garments that had been boiled down to their constituent parts and re-amalgamated, with Led Zeppelin’s “Kashmir” blaring out and D-rings hanging off waists, they looked exactly right.
Reduce, Reinvent, Reboot
“I feel like it’s important to be grounded now, because the world is in such chaos and upside down,” said Sarah Burton after a fantastic Alexander McQueen show. She was back in Paris after three years of London shows, but she wasn’t celebrating. She was tailoring. She was, as she said, “stripping away” down to the anatomy of a suit or a jumpsuit — strong-shoulder, no-nonsense, in black and gray. One constructed to make you “feel quite held, in a way that is still incredibly relevant and beautiful.”
The only adornment came in the form of orchids (painted onto, yes, black coats, and jackets; built out of armorial silver on a dress) and neckties. Ties! Which were also on view at Valentino in almost every outfit, since designer Pierpaolo Piccioli based his entire collection on the idea of black tie and the way social constructs can be rewritten by context. After all, now that ties have been abandoned by the professional classes, they can get repurposed by fashion world: into abstracted symbols of uniform; into totems of power.
“I wanted something more strict,” Piccioli said before the show about his repurposing of an old-fashion dress code. “There’s been too much eclecticism. Too much buzz.” Sometimes limitations can actually be liberating
To wit: 73 iterations of an alternative in black, white, pink and red as well as striped, checkerboarded, short, long, collared, crystal-bedecked, ruffled and feathered. The best option was the simplest: a floor-length white shirtdress cut generously loose and sliced to the thigh on one side. The sort of dress that would make you feel like the most sophisticated host of your own life, without getting in its way.
If that’s one solution to the dilemma of navigating the current environment, Rei Kawakubo offered another, describing the impetus for her Comme des Garçons collection as “wanting to go back to the starting point,” to “return to the source.”
Not the source of inspiration or the life source: the actual birth of the universe (she’s not the only one; escaping Earth has been something of a subtrend this season). How else to reboot this whole thing? We may have reached that breaking point.
Then she offered up 11 passages, in pairs, each set to their own slice of music, each like a mishmash of molecules colliding: black and white and red and blue; fake fur and wool and tulle; layers and lumps and roses and protrusions. By the end, a few appeared to have coalesced into actual dress form.
It was a potent reminder that from the beginning, no matter what else is going on, we’ve always needed something to wear. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

This is an online consignment store, but you can make an appointment and send links of what you like, then try it all on at its showroom. Allow Matt, who runs the showroom, to bring you a coffee, and try on a Jil Sander paisley dress from when Raf Simons was the designer or an ivory Chanel jacket like the one in “The Devil Wears Prada” or a ruffled Prada blouse consigned by Catherine Deneuve.
Le Bon Marché
All grand (and less than grand) department stores owe their existences to this place. Émile Zola used it as the setting for “The Ladies Paradise,” in 1883. Here’s how I navigate it. I go to the lingerie-swimwear section. The Empreinte lingerie brand for large busts and plus sizes is hard to find in the United States but has the most comfortable and beautiful collections.
The second floor has a beauty section for niche brands, where you can buy hair masks and dental floss from brands you’ve never heard of. Then do a loop of the designer collections as an overview to see which ones speak to you. Go to, say, Dries Van Noten for an immersive experience. Go to the Buly counter for souvenirs, like a lip balm that comes in a box that can be embossed with initials. Buy snacks at the food hall across the street, which sells things like carrot-passion fruit jam and has at least three aisles dedicated to yogurt. Open Sundays!
Sabbia Rosa
If your ideal look is ’90s off-duty supermodel, this is your heaven. There are exquisite but extremely expensive handmade slips here. Everything can be custom-made, which is dangerous. Do not skip the satin mule slippers with the bow.
Monoprix
Monoprix is basically the French equivalent of Target. The organic cotton underwear comes in a ribbed culotte — a bikini style — or culotte haute, which is more like granny panties. They’re not dissimilar to the handmade underwear from Zimmerli or Hanro but around five euros. Stock up on Savon de Marseille hand soap and filet à provisions, those net market bags.
Em Archives
This new vintage showroom made a cameo in the Blackbird Spyplane newsletter. On a recent visit, it had at least one oversize Donna Karan blouse, an Hermès blazer, Comme des Garçons flats from 1997 and several pairs of Jil Sander trousers at extremely competitive prices.
Flea Market
There are several flea markets in Paris, but the largest is the Puces de Paris Saint-Ouen at the northern border of the city. The place is gigantic, so you absolutely need some kind of strategy. Choose a category (a friend had great luck looking for antique tablecloths) or pick one area to browse. The Marché Paul Bert Serpette is my favorite and has a mix of furniture and clothes.
Will you find a deal? Maybe. Will you want to buy a chair and ship it home? Absolutely! There are shipping companies on site, or just build it a box and check it as oversize luggage on a flight home. For something easier to take home, De Laurentis has late ’80s and early ’90s European and Japanese minimalist designer clothes, and Chantal has beaded flapper dresses reminiscent of the first Bode women’s collection.
Charvet
Who doesn’t want to authentically dress like Lydia Tár these days? This is a multistory palace of tailoring. Get the slippers, get a striped nightshirt that can be worn as a dress, maybe get a rosette brooch made out of necktie material. Then cross to the Hemingway Bar at the Ritz for a cocktail. It’s sort of like the Bemelmans Bar of Paris.
La Tuile à Loup
Maybe its stern but direct Instagram bio says it all: “Finest of handmade tableware. MADE IN FRANCE. International shipping available.” Do you want a vase with a jellyfish on it? Or how about a marbled tray? Maybe all you need to know is that Ina Garten was recently photographed there. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Dries Van Noten and Olivier Rousteing of Balmain get personal.
PARIS -- For so long (even, maybe especially, after the brief Covid hiatus) so much of fashion has been focused on being big -- big shows, big sets, big stars, big followings, big growth -- that to talk about intimacy, about being small, can seem new.
It's not, of course: The clothes we put on, which literally touch our skin, have always been among our most personally resonant belongings, repositories of individual history, even as they also make public statements. It's just that recently the public statements (or made-for-selfie statements) have been so overwhelming that they tended to drown out any other idea.
Yet there they were, both Olivier Rousteing of Balmain, a brand built on Kardashian and Jenner-size ambition and bombast, and Dries Van Noten, king of the emotive gesture, name-checking the preciously personal.
Intimacy with clothing is the emotional flip side of the popular term "wearable," which is fast going from being a synonym for boring to a laudable adjective suggestive of smart thinking about daily life. It started in New York with Proenza Schouler, continued in Milan at Prada and Bottega Veneta. So the fashion hamster wheel turns.
Maybe it has to do with the general horror at megalomania and global domination -- by companies or countries. Maybe it's social media fatigue. Maybe it has to do with an appreciation of the human, in the face of war. There's a lot of grimness so far in Paris fashion; a lot of black and gray on the runway, creating a sense of looming austerity. At Undercover, Jun Takahashi even included little skeletal hands on his suiting, like phantoms rising from the grave (also the lyrics, from The Specials' 1980 cover version of the 1949 song "Enjoy Yourself": "Enjoy yourself/It's later than you think," scripted on the backs of jackets).
Or maybe that's all over-egging it and it's just about self-justification. Maybe a better way of thinking about intimacy: the return is another way of talking about sustainability, which has otherwise unfortunately disappeared from the fashion conversation (possibly because the environmental impact of brands is being considered in actual practice, though by all reports not as effectively as needed). Still, it's increasingly clear there's a divide between those paying lip service to an idea and those actually thinking it through.
Or, in Mr. Van Noten's case, designing it through. His guiding principle being that clothes should be valued and loved until they are worn out -- and then repaired and loved some more. That they should not be disposable. That in not just the making, but the wearing, they contain volumes.
Designers tend to go on and on about the touch of the hand and the value of artisanal creation, and those have meaning, unquestionably. It's part of what you pay for when you buy high-end fashion. What they talk about less is what happens after, when the clothes become part of a life. Yet that may be the most priceless part of the experience, and that's what Mr. Van Noten was honoring.
"For me, it's really the opposite of wanting to show off with the garments," he said backstage in the gargantuan amphitheater where he held his show. "It's really things which for you personally are important." Or become personally important.
That meant a focus, above all, on fabrics: rich and plain, masculine and feminine, tough and fragile. A bit of silk, handwoven and hand-painted, patchworked onto the hem of a skirt and then laid under a scrim of chiffon, worn with a gray jacket. Some gold leaf, painted to resemble a corset onto the waist of a camel wool coat. A pinstripe bustier, stitched in gleaming thread and worn with an easy pantsuit, the jacket fraying at the edges. It was make do and mend, the British wartime mantra, dashed with a bit of 1930s drama and raised to the nth degree. Klimtian luxe meets wabi-sabi. Redolent with imagination about how such pieces might be worn.
That's what was missing from the Balmain collection, despite Mr. Rousteing's stated determination to pull back from his megashows.
This time he swapped the stadium of his previous show, which had also involved an appearance by Cher and 7,000 guests (a.k.a., his Balmain army), for 220 guests and a living room setup with low white couches snaking their way around a room. And this time he was talking backstage about a return to original Balmain principles, back in 1945. "I think we are going through a moment in fashion where people need to remember what fashion is about," he said. "It's about quality, it's about timelessness. It's not about hype." That for him, the show and its approach were the start of "a new chapter," the "new me." A focus on craft.
Sounds good. Except that Mr. Rousteing seemed to translate craft as a lot of structure and more than a bit of bling. Just because it comes in a 1950s silhouette (also a theme at Dior), and to the tune of Frank Sinatra crooning a very on-the-nose "My Way," doesn't change the actual effect. Think a quilted, silver shoulder-framing jacket, plunging to the clavicle in front and gleaming with sequins, over cigarette pants. Sweetheart necklines, peplums and full skirts dotted with gobstopper pearls. More pearls -- pearls galore. A tea dress entirely encrusted in rhinestones. Turned out it was the space, not the clothes, that got small.
On Instagram, it was probably fabulous. Close-up, it was blinding.

Dasha Zhukova's Post-Oligarch Life: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The oligarch's ex-wife had carefully built a place for herself in the art world. And then, Putin's war started.
"If there's one place in the world that's fighting today for freedom and democracy, where people -- men, women and children, everybody -- are dying as we are having dinner right now, that is Ukraine," chef José Andrés told a well-heeled crowd at the Museum of Modern Art in November, as he accepted an Innovator Award from the Wall Street Journal Magazine, a Ukrainian flag pin on his lapel. Attendees rose to their feet and broke into applause.
Among them was Dasha Zhukova, a philanthropist, entrepreneur and socialite. For a decade she was married to the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich.
The former couple, who divorced in 2017, still have an arts foundation and co-own the Garage Museum of Contemporary Art in Moscow; Ms. Zhukova also continues as creative director of New Holland Island, a cultural hub in St. Petersburg they founded. Their young children, alongside his children from a previous marriage, were reportedly named beneficiaries of trusts worth billions of dollars in a hurried reallocation of their father's assets, not long before the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
If anyone found it strange that Ms. Zhukova, who is also the daughter of a Russian oil magnate, was spending an evening in the same space as the Pussy Riot co-founder Nadya Tolokonnikova (who spent more than a year in a penal colony for criticizing President Vladimir Putin of Russia, and presented an award that night in a jacket with the words "ARREST ME" on the back), they didn't let on.
Ms. Zhukova, 41 and now married to Stavros Niarchos II, the grandson of a Greek shipping tycoon, was in the midst of a post-divorce rebrand when the first Russian bombs fell on Kyiv a year ago. She had a new husband and baby, as well as an art-inflected real estate venture that she was getting off the ground in New York and Philadelphia.
But the work that had built her reputation continued, too. She had recently returned from Moscow, where she and Mr. Abramovich, 56, had announced an expansion of the Garage, by then an internationally recognized museum. She did an interview and posed for photographs in Vogue Russia to promote their plans.
The atrocities of the war unfolded quickly, and public outcry was just as swift. There was newfound scrutiny of what it meant to do business with the oligarchs, who, during the Putin era, had become deeply entangled with the art and real-estate worlds in New York and London as they sought to invest in the West.
Ms. Zhukova, who has both U.S. and Russian citizenship, is among the most high-profile people in the United States to be closely connected to a Russian oligarch.
As a result, the last year has represented a test of sorts for her, and for the art world: How much did it matter that the money that had built her reputation came largely from an oligarch?
People close to her brushed aside Ms. Zhukova's association with Mr. Abramovich, or claimed not to know much about their relationship. More than 40 people, most of them in the art world, were interviewed for this article, though some declined to go on the record, worried about professional consequences.
The art dealer Larry Gagosian agreed to an interview about Ms. Zhukova, a longtime client, but cut it off at the first question, after the mention of the word "Moscow," and said he was uncomfortable. Condé Nast's Anna Wintour also agreed to an interview, and then was suddenly unavailable. She emailed a statement instead, writing, in part, "You can't fake the kind of passion Dasha has for the arts." David Geffen (who called her "kind, charming") and Rem Koolhaas, who designed the Garage Museum (and said she had "solid intelligence"), were happy to talk, however.
Ms. Zhukova declined to be interviewed for this article.
Over the past decade and a half, Ms. Zhukova had ridden the wave of the art scene's embrace of oligarch money to build a career for herself in the upper echelons of that world. With her carefully chosen spending and giving, she was following a classic American script, and alchemizing money into cultural status.
Other Russian oligarchs have collectively donated millions to major arts institutions in New York and London. Some became trustees (and stepped down last year). But it was Ms. Zhukova, not Mr. Abramovich, who joined art-world boards -- including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) -- helping to establish her as a powerful figure in her own right.
And she had proved to be a connector, as the founder of the well-received art magazine Garage, a co-founder and early investor in the online art marketplace Artsy, and a tastemaker among some socialites and collectors.
In some ways, Ms. Zhukova is what Anna Delvey, the now famous con artist, wanted to be: an ambitious businesswoman and maven of the art world, with family money and social influence that runs as deep as her pockets.
Damage Control
In February 2022, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, Ms. Zhukova issued a statement condemning the war, "in solidarity with the Ukrainian people as well as the millions of Russians who feel the same way."
She spent the first few months of the invasion lying low -- no Met Ball, no sharing on Instagram -- then quietly vacationed in Europe for the summer.
As she tried to remain out of the spotlight, some of her closest friends posted about the war on social media: Lauren Santo Domingo, the founder of the luxury retailer Moda Operandi and the doyenne of New York socialites, frequently re-tweeted about war crimes being committed by Russian forces in Ukraine; Derek Blasberg, the well-connected writer who is the executive editor of Gagosian Quarterly and the media and culture consultant for "Succession," shared an Instagram image of the Picasso peace dove holding a Ukrainian flag. His post received both praise and backlash, with commenters pointing to his close relationship to Ms. Zhukova as evidence of hypocrisy.
The art world responded, too. The British artist Damien Hirst -- a favorite of the oligarchs -- painted a Ukrainian flag with his signature butterflies for a last-minute Venice Biennale exhibition titled "This is Ukraine: Defending Freedom." The Russian Pavilion was nixed from the biennale, and there was a sudden, urgent focus on Ukrainian artists.
Auction houses, which had for more than a decade courted the Russian oligarchs, went into damage control. Christie's and Sotheby's made donations to Ukrainian aid, and canceled upcoming sales of Russian artists' work. Phillips Auction House, which is owned by Russians, donated more than $ 7 million to the Ukrainian Red Cross. (In February, federal prosecutors in New York reportedly subpoenaed auction houses for sales records to look for potential sanction violations; Mr. Abramovich was one of several oligarchs named, according to Bloomberg.)
The official Instagram account for the Garage Museum posted a since-deleted black square with text announcing that the museum was stopping all exhibitions until the end of the war, and opposed "all actions that sow division." Alison Gingeras, a curator and art historian who helped lead an art-world protest of Ivanka Trump after her father was elected president, copied the post to her own feed and called it "PR tiptoeing double speak and whitewashing." She wrote: "Nothing less than a full throated denunciation of Putin and his oligarch enablers is acceptable."
Behind the scenes, museum board directors concluded that Ms. Zhukova's involvement with their institutions posed no issues. When the war began, "there were a number of conversations," said Max Hollein, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, who stepped down from the international advisory board of Russia's State Hermitage Museum in reaction to the war. But he said there was "no doubt" about Ms. Zhukova continuing as a Met trustee. It was important to Mr. Hollein that Ms. Zhukova had issued an early statement against the war.
"She's been here in the U.S. for a long time," Mr. Hollein said. "She's not on a sanctions list."
Michael Govan, the director and chief executive of LACMA, noted that Ms. Zhukova spent a significant part of her childhood in Los Angeles. "Anybody who knew the details inside, of course, didn't really associate her in that way," he said. "Plus, obviously, she's already remarried."
By fall, her social hiatus was over, too. In September alone, she attended the opening of Urs Fischer's show at Gagosian Gallery, a party at Anna Wintour's townhouse and the opening of a $ 250,000 a year members-only club on the Upper East Side.
Around the same time, Mr. Abramovich anchored his yachts in sanctions-free Turkey. (Britain and the European Union have imposed sanctions on Mr. Abramovich, but the United States has not, reportedly at the request of President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, who believed he might be a useful lifeline to communicate with Mr. Putin. However, the U.S. government has warrants to seize two jets it says belong to Mr. Abramovich.)
Mr. Abramovich declined to comment for this article.
A Moscow Socialite by Way of Los Angeles
Ms. Zhukova was born in Moscow in 1981, her own story mirroring the explosion of wealth that would come to define the post-Soviet era. Her mother, Elena, was a molecular biologist, and her father, Alexander, worked as an editor. They divorced when Ms. Zhukova was 3.
When Ms. Zhukova was 10, she and Elena moved into a one-bedroom rental apartment in Houston, after Elena accepted a job at Baylor College of Medicine; scientists were leaving the Soviet Union in droves as funding for their work decreased. Her father remained in Moscow, where he was part of the rush to profit off the natural resources up for grabs in newly capitalist Russia.
Two years later Dasha and her mother moved again, after Elena was offered a job at the University of California Los Angeles. Ms. Zhukova went to Pacific Hills, a small private school in West Hollywood, which her father paid for. Starting in the eighth grade, she worked at the Beverly Center shopping mall. ("How many 'oligarch's wives' worked at Mrs. Fields Cookies in the mall?" Mr. Blasberg said.)
She was aware of her father's new wealth; when they'd take ski trips in the Alps, it was apparent he'd entered another stratosphere. As she was finishing her degree at the University of California, Santa Barbara, she studied abroad in Russia. In the new Moscow, she was a socialite with a hint of a Southern California accent. She began dating the Russian tennis pro Marat Safin, then one of the top players in the world, and was photographed at his matches.
Ms. Zhukova, who moved to London in 2004, made the most of her fame, starting a clothing company, Kova & T, with a friend. Its faux leather leggings and skinny jeans gained traction with starlets of the mid-aughts. Young rich Russians in London wore them, too, eager for an alternative to the flashy clothes they'd become known for.
In 2006, the same year Kova & T's "Dasha" jeans appeared in major stores, a friend introduced Ms. Zhukova and Mr. Abramovich. He was at the time one of the wealthiest people in the world, according to Forbes, after he had bought a state-run oil company in the mid-1990s, then sold back his shares to the Russian government at a significant profit.
Mr. Abramovich served as governor of a particularly frigid Russian region, but was spending more and more time in London, where he'd bought the Chelsea football club, making him famous in parts of Europe, even though he was said to be quite shy.
Soon, Ms. Zhukova and Mr. Abramovich were seen at Chelsea matches together. In 2007, he and his second wife of 16 years divorced.
Neither Ms. Zhukova nor Mr. Abramovich spoke publicly about their relationship. The money talked loudly enough: Ms. Zhukova had become interested in contemporary art, and Mr. Abramovich set records in 2008 by buying a Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud at auction for a combined $ 120 million. Mr. Abramovich had been quietly collecting already, but there was speculation in the press that Ms. Zhukova had inspired the purchases.
Early on, the media framed Ms. Zhukova as a dilettante. She appeared on the cover of a Times of London fashion insert, described as "the girl who transfixed Britain's richest oligarch."
In interviews, however, she gave the impression of wanting to be taken more seriously: In 2009, she told GQ Russia that Miuccia Prada and the artist Cindy Sherman were her role models. When asked who she would want to be for a day, she answered, "Obama."
Building the Garage
In the mid-to-late aughts, Russia's contemporary arts scene, which had gone underground during the Soviet era, was having a moment, as the Russian men made rich by the last decade decided to play in the cultural realm.
"The oligarchs I know of bought themselves, first and foremost, access to knowledge," said Joachim Pissarro, the chairman of the U.S.-based Hermitage Museum Foundation and the head of the Hunter College Galleries in New York. "If they did not know what they were buying, they made sure to have all the right experts." (Ms. Zhukova's art adviser, Sandy Heller, has also worked with the hedge-fund billionaire and New York Mets owner Steven A. Cohen and venture capitalist Joshua Kushner.)
Buying art wasn't just an investment. It achieved what buying a yacht -- obvious, gauche --could not. The goal was to "convert your money into something that has a cultural touch," said Elisabeth Schimpfössl, an associate professor of sociology and policy at Aston University in Britain, who interviewed Russian billionaires for her book "Rich Russians: From Oligarchs to Bourgeoise."
It was an effective strategy, including on this side of the pond. "If you take New York's attitude toward moneyed people and accelerate it 100 times, now you have the art world," said Michael Gross, who has chronicled the city's high society for decades. "The art world doesn't give a damn who you are. The art world just wants to see the number of zeros in your checkbook."
Mr. Gagosian recognized the power of this new class of Russian buyers early on, and made inroads in Russia as early as 2003, lending Cy Twombly works to the State Hermitage; other dealers followed. Sotheby's opened a Moscow office in 2007 and Christie's did so in 2010.
Ms. Zhukova, who opened the Garage in 2008, was part of a trend: A number of women related to oligarchs started art initiatives between 2003 and 2008, when the contemporary art market was booming, in part because of a surge of new Russian buyers. Compared with some of her peers, she was initially seen as an arriviste. But she proved skilled at cultivating relationships, and bringing on big names to work with her.
In just nine months, she turned a 1920s Constructivist bus depot into a renovated exhibition space, and the Garage was born. For the soft opening -- a party with 300 guests, including Jeff Koons, Mr. Gagosian and Ronald Lauder -- she displayed a hanging light installation by the artist Rafael Lozano-Hemmer that pulsed with the heartbeat of whoever touched it. After dinner, at which prawns and roast sirloin were washed down with vodka and champagne, Amy Winehouse took to the stage and performed her song "Hey Little Rich Girl."
Ms. Zhukova's newfound cachet quickly extended beyond Moscow. The same summer she celebrated the Garage, she hosted the Serpentine Gallery's annual fete in Kensington Gardens, a prestigious event where artists and wealthy collectors mingle with celebrities and socialites. The New York Times declared that "overnight" she'd become an "art-world It Girl." In 2009, LACMA named her to its board.
And powerful officials in the world's most influential cities wanted to be in business with Ms. Zhukova, too: In London, Mayor Boris Johnson asked her to lunch, to talk about funding a cultural project there. In New York, she hosted a 2013 dinner with Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Mr. Bloomberg said he was making Ms. Zhukova and Mr. Abramovich honorary citizens of New York, and joked, "Roman's going to have a heart attack thinking he has to pay taxes."
The geopolitical mood shifted in February 2014, when Mr. Putin illegally annexed Crimea. The United States and the European Union responded with what were ultimately toothless sanctions against various Russian companies and individuals with ties to the Kremlin. Mr. Abramovich was spared, and so was his and Ms. Zhukova's social status.
Two weeks after Mr. Putin claimed Crimea as part of Russia following a fraudulent referendum, Ms. Zhukova posed for photographs at the 35th anniversary gala for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. Vogue named her to its "best dressed" list for the week, noting her Lanvin frock.
(She received backlash that year, but for a different reason: In a rare public blunder, she posed for a photograph sitting on a "chair" by the Norwegian artist Bjarne Melgaard that depicted a Black woman in bondage. The image spurred outrage online, and Ms. Zhukova publicly apologized. )
Behind the scenes, Ms. Zhukova was expanding her ambitions for the Garage, with plans to turn it into Moscow's equivalent of MoMA or the Tate Modern. She hired Kate Fowle, who later went on to lead MoMA PS1, as chief curator. Ms. Zhukova and Mr. Abramovich also brought on Mr. Koolhaas to reimagine what had been a cavernous Soviet-era restaurant into a silvery modernist box, outfitted with big garage doors. The new museum was the centerpiece of a revamped Gorky Park, now filled with bike paths and restaurants.
Showing at Garage became, for artists, "a credible and attractive thing to be able to have on your C.V.," said the artist Rashid Johnson, whose works have been acquired by MoMA and the Met, as well as by Ms. Zhukova. (Only rarely did artists decline, Ms. Fowle said, but it did happen. The most common reason was discomfort showing in a country with anti-L.G.B.T.Q. laws.) Ms. Fowle piloted a training program for contemporary art curation at the Garage, which she said was the first of its kind in Russia, and also developed an extensive Soviet art archive.
To celebrate the reopening in 2015, Ms. Zhukova once again got a crowd (George Lucas, Karlie Kloss, Harvey Weinstein, the French art dealer Almine Ruiz-Picasso, the Serpentine Gallery director Hans Ulrich Obrist) to Moscow. Arianna Huffington moderated multiple panels, and journalists flew in from across the globe, their expenses covered by the museum.
From Oligarchs to Oprah
In the middle of the last decade, Ms. Zhukova shifted her focus to New York, where she already had friends from the international jet set. She and Mr. Abramovich planted a flag in Manhattan: Over time, he bought multiple townhouses on the Upper East Side to be configured into one giant mansion. (He already owned a $ 36 million mansion and $ 11 million ski chalet in Colorado, mere blips in his vast real estate portfolio.)
Privately, however, their marriage was unraveling. (Neither Ms. Zhukova nor Mr. Abramovich have spoken publicly about the cause of their split.) In August 2017, they announced that they were separating, their official statement noting that they remained "close friends, parents, and partners in the projects we developed together." The same week, Ms. Zhukova was pictured on Mr. Geffen's yacht near Sicily along with Diane von Furstenberg and Oprah Winfrey. She was comfortably ensconced among the United States' own billionaires.
As the divorce unfolded, Ms. Zhukova and her children temporarily moved into an unoccupied East 64th Street mansion owned by the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska; in the spring of 2018 the U.S. government imposed sanctions on Mr. Deripaska, and he left the country. Then, as part of the divorce settlement, Mr. Abramovich transferred the Upper East Side homes he'd bought -- valued at $ 92 million -- to Ms. Zhukova. On their son's first day at a new school, her friend Mr. Blasberg went with Ms. Zhukova to drop-off.
Several months after the separation announcement, Ms. Zhukova attended an event at the Met with Mr. Niarchos, who had been tabloid fodder in his 20s when he dated Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan. He was already part of Ms. Zhukova's social scene. (His jewelry designer sister, Eugenie, was friends with Ms. Zhukova.)
At their much-Instagrammed $ 6.5 million wedding in January 2020, most of which took place at the Niarchos family's luxurious Kulm Hotel in St. Moritz, guests included Mrs. Prada, Kate Hudson, Mr. Kushner, Wendi Deng, Katy Perry, Baroness Dambisa Moyo, members of the Greek royal family and Princess Beatrice.
For a Russian-Winter-themed party that was part of the weekend's festivities, they dressed in traditional garb, including furry ushankas, military jackets and floral crowns. (In the lead-up to the wedding, Mr. Blasberg helped organize Ms. Zhukova's bachelorette party in Las Vegas, where she wore a 1980s wedding dress and later danced on stage while Gwen Stefani performed.) For Ms. Zhukova, who had kept much of her first marriage out of the public eye, it was a significant shift.
In March 2021, she and Mr. Niarchos had their first child together, and two months later Ms. Zhukova announced her real estate venture, Ray. For now, Ray is focused on residential rental buildings with an artistic bent.
Ray's flagship location is in partnership with the National Black Theater in Harlem, a $ 185 million development scheduled to open in 2024, designed by Frida Escobedo, an architect in Mexico City who was recently hired to design the Met's new $ 500 million contemporary wing. Construction is in the early stages but the space will eventually include a renovated theater owned by the N.B.T., along with public art galleries, shared work spaces and apartments. (A portion of the apartments, in compliance with New York City's mandatory inclusionary housing rules, will be below market rate.)
In early press coverage Ms. Zhukova seemed eager to position the project in modern Medici mode. WSJ Magazine, edited by Ms. Zhukova's friend Kristina O'Neill, reported that Ms. Zhukova hoped the complex could help keep more artists in a city with skyrocketing housing costs, and noted a partnership with Artspace, a nonprofit in Minneapolis that creates and supports housing for artists. But a spokesperson for Artspace said they have never had a contract. Ms. Zhukova's spokesperson said conversations between Ray and Artspace "are ongoing."
Ray's first location, a market-rate rental building in Philadelphia, will open this spring and include six artist studios, one of which has been granted to an artist in residence. Mr. Johnson, who currently has work on display at the Met Opera, is designing an installation for the lobby.
The Art World Moves On
As the Russia Ukraine war rages on, the Garage, once a beacon for contemporary art in Russia, is a shell of its former self. As a result of the war, the substantial expansion to the Garage that Mr. Abramovich and Ms. Zhukova had announced in late 2021 is on hold. The museum is operating with a fraction of its staff, and exhibitions are paused indefinitely. Russian artists, including some of the country's most famous, have fled, as a matter of both safety and conscience.
For now, the art market has moved on from Russian oligarchs. In November, Christie's had a record-setting auction, with five sales over $ 100 million, and total sales reaching $ 1.5 billion -- about a quarter of which came from Asian buyers.
Multiple people in the art world who know Mr. Abramovich expressed fondness for him, even sympathy -- but not publicly. (Several mentioned his philanthropic efforts.)
Ms. Schimpfossl said that in London, a similar sentiment about the Russian oligarchs is shared among the wealthy. "People often ask me, highly intelligent people, 'Well, we allowed them in," she said. "'They ask, how do we all of a sudden do a U-turn? It's not fair to them."' She predicted that ultimately, many of the oligarchs will be rehabilitated, "in order to do normal business again as soon as possible."
Back in New York, Ms. Zhukova is accruing more credentials in the art world. She is pursuing a master's degree in art history from N.Y.U. And in December, weeks after being named to the new Gagosian Gallery board, she was a chairwoman of the Met acquisitions gala, just as she had been the year before.

Full text: The style at fashion week in Milan, perhaps more than in any other city, is defined by logos and labels.
Wearing pieces from a brand to its runway show has long been a custom of fashion week. But in Milan, perhaps more than in any other city, this trend is more noticeable -- and when you go inside shows, you can better observe the trickle-down (and trickle-up) relationship between clothes worn on the street and what's presented on a runway.
At Max Mara, all the elegant overcoats and tonal separates in the crowd suggested a seemingly endless appetite for refined basics, two words that characterize both the brand and its latest collection. Shiny suits on some guests at Gucci reflected the whimsy that Alessandro Michele, its former creative director, had brought to the label. (Mr. Michele didn't design the latest Gucci collection, but his influence could still be detected in certain pieces, like a shimmering silver coat.)
The most exciting show to compare looks from the crowds to those on the runway, though, might have been Diesel, which has found new relevance under the designer Glenn Martens and, as a result, has attracted a whole new generation of fans.

Imagine and Deliver a New Uniform: [Style Desk]

Full text: Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons elevate the everyday, while, at Fendi, Kim Jones splits the suit.
MILAN -- The Prada show invitation did not arrive alone. It came with a delicate calla lily, rolled out of starched white cotton and ready to be pinned to a lapel. Also a door stopper of a 550-page monograph titled "Recycling Beauty" and chronicling the current exhibition at the Fondazione Prada: an examination of the way in which themes and materials (and ideas) are reused and reinvented over time.
How we see things and what we see in them changes according to context; how the familiar can be filched and made new, depending on the situation and the eye of the beholder. Sometimes that's called a readymade, sometimes cheating, sometimes brilliance. Sometimes it's a little fabric flower on a safety pin, like a peace offering.
Well, that's the story of fashion. You take a garment with a hole for the head and two holes for the arms and maybe a little something for the legs and transform it according to custom and the exigencies of the moment.
And that's what Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons did, in a Prada show that took the subject of uniforms -- the kind that surround us, the kind that are so familiar they often go unseen (not the kind associated with the war in Ukraine, though it has been a year since Russia invaded, and the consequences have affected our closets in ways we don't always realize) -- and lavished them with the sort of detailed attention normally bestowed on couture.
The endless style appeal of uniforms is nothing new: It's rooted deep in our psyche, capable of pushing emotional buttons both good and bad, depending on the memories and associations. But this gave a different twist to an old story.
It was different, for example, than the "personal uniform" often touted by fashion as desirable: the identifiable look adopted by an individual as a form of value or community signaling. And it was different from the default uniform developed by Silicon Valley figures like Mark Zuckerberg and Elizabeth Holmes, who espoused the value of wearing the same thing every day as a shortcut to freeing the mind. It was different from the performative deconstruction of Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren, which was a political statement of rebellion against the uniform; rejecting the idea of a dress code.
It was even different from what Kim Jones did at Fendi, though he was also playing with uniforms, albeit of the more white collar and Catholic school kind; taking pinstripes, kilts and suiting, layering them together and twisting them up just a little bit, then adding a touch of kink for interest. Imagine a skirt slit to the thigh at the side, for example, to show the shirttails and over-the-knee boots beneath; a long ribbed knit sliced open unexpectedly at the ribs.
This was reworking the uniform as a form of homage and devotion. It was acknowledging the comfort in the familiar and then amplifying that with a touch of grace. The point being, Mrs. Prada said during a joint interview backstage afterward, "to give importance to what is modest: a simple job, a modest job and not only extreme beauty." To acknowledge, "beauty is in everyday things."
That's a laudable idea, though it's also true that using certain uniforms as inspiration for clothes that people in such jobs will never be able to afford can smack of Marie Antoinette role play and noblesse oblige. But Prada has a long history with finding beauty in the quotidian. And the point isn't about play acting, but rather recasting the whole story. You force people to look differently at the source material. Or to actually look at the source material to begin with.
Like duffle coats and parkas. Here in wool, with the back belled out like a cocoon and caught by a seam just at the top of the thighs, hands tucked into neat little pockets high on the ribs, so it changes the posture. Or caretakers' shirtdresses, rendered as evening wear in crisp white cotton dropped narrowly to the ankles, hitched up on the bias at the hips and fishtailing behind on the floor (trains are a thing this season, also showing up at Fendi).
Or khaki shirts, with epaulets and even neckties, tucked into very high-waist peg-leg pants -- the no-nonsense kind that could signal a move away from the low-slung wide-leg trousers that have been the dominant pants of the past year.
The colors were mostly gray, brown, army green and navy. It was all about the form: the curves carved by the clothed body in space. The function. And the emotional connections triggered.
And it is part of a definite swing this season away from escapism and toward an alternate theory of the role of fashion. Not as rebel yell of hedonism and fringe in the face of complicated realities, though that has its uses, but as a coping mechanism that does not demand too much.
It's not the swaddling self-care clothing that was dominant during lockdown. It's stuff made for being out in the world; stuff meant for navigating the world. And there are alternate propositions: At Moschino, Jeremy Scott often offers a bit of absurdist elegance, though this season his take on distorted reality via melting florals, dripping hemlines and rhinestones gone wild seemed more of a zigzag and less of a zinger.
But more and more it's becoming clear that sometimes, especially when the job is hard, it's OK for the clothes to be easy.

Full text: On a night of many, many, many, (so many) stars, here are some outstanding red carpet moments.
Viewers of the livestream of the 29th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards could be forgiven for having a hard time keeping up with the onslaught of outfits on the red carpet. Unlike the Oscars or the Golden Globes, it is an event in which actors nominate and celebrate one another. So although the show wasn't televised, the ceremony, which took place Sunday night at the Fairmont Century Plaza in Century City, Los Angeles, attracted many of the most established names in Hollywood as well as some of the most exciting breakthrough talent of the year: Cate Blanchett, Viola Davis, Michelle Williams, Jamie Lee Curtis, Jennifer Coolidge, Patricia Arquette, Sam Elliott, Brendan Fraser, Haley Lu Richardson, Austin Butler, Jenna Ortega, Stephanie Hsu, Will Sharpe, Mark Indelicato, Megan Stalter and Tyler James Williams are just a sample of who showed up.
A night with so much talent brought a veritable rainbow of gowns -- and suits -- in scorching reds, indelible greens, cheerful yellows and a smattering of every shade of pink. But plenty of staple black, white and silver made an appearance as well. It's hard to go wrong with a well-cut, glittery gown. Below, some standouts.
Michelle Yeoh
The black Schiaparelli couture gown, festooned with a swath of pasta-colored frizz and accessorized with Moussaieff jewelry, was both elegant and strange -- like her role in "Everything Everywhere All At Once."
Eddie Redmayne
Amid a sea of plain black suits, this high-necked Saint Laurent shirt gave the ginger-haired Mr. Redmayne a jaunty vibe.
Ayo Edebiri
In real life, "The Bear" actor likes to keep things cool. Her checkered blue-and-brown Emilia Wickstead dress struck just the right balance of dressed up, but not overdone.
Julia Garner
Would Anna Delvey (née Sorokin) have approved of this copper-hued Gucci gown with shells over the breasts? No matter, because we do.
Quinta Brunson
Lustrous but playful, with a shell top: The "Abbott Elementary" star gave a lesson in standing out while fitting right in.
Mark Indelicato
No monotone here! The "Hacks" star mixed his Calvin Klein suit with a vintage purple Thierry Mugler shirt, with the kind of ruffles you'd want to get lost in.
Hong Chau
Lingerie dresses can risk feeling too underdressed -- but this couture Fendi had enough surface work and textures to keep the eye enthralled.
Danielle Deadwyler
A seriously fancy, scalloped Vuitton dress, fit for a seriously talented actor.
Meghann Fahy
This simple white Ralph Lauren dress with a few cutouts doesn't scream out for attention, but it ends up getting it anyway.
Haley Lu Richardson
If you designed a dress to capture Ms. Richardson's natural effervescence, it might be this one: covered in bubbly white baubles, by Carolina Herrera.
Claire Foy
Regal in a shiny floor-length, acid yellow Prada, with a steeply cut bust and a single strand of diamonds.
Sheryl Lee Ralph
The fierce advice Ms. Ralph's stylist, who also happens to be her daughter, gave her -- "You've got to rise like a phoenix, but younger" -- broke through in her gold Tadashi Shoji ensemble.
Jenna Ortega
A little rock, a little goth. It was hard not to want to see Ms. Ortega break out into her viral Wednesday Addams dance, wearing this black Versace.
Amanda Seyfried
Ripping off Elizabeth Holmes's tech uniform, Ms. Seyfried gave off a '60s go-go dancer vibe with her green-apple Prada.
Austin Butler
Still channeling the King of Rock, a little flare goes a long way in this deep burgundy tuxedo by Gucci.
Rooney Mara
Delicate panels of black lace make an image of a feathered bird over the front of this Alexander McQueen dress.
Niecy Nash-Betts
Her spectacularly bright yellow Vera Wang gown brought some much needed sun on a rare rainy day in Los Angeles.
Will Sharpe
The "White Lotus" star made red the peekaboo color of the season with his Ferragamo shirt.
Cate Blanchett
In this Giorgio Armani Prive gown, a sequin bodice gave way to lace detailing. Lydia Tar would never, but that's just fine.
Sam Elliott
That head of hair and signature mustache could make anyone want to go gray.
Ana De Armas
Critics are split on her portrayal of Marilyn Monroe, but there's no denying the high glamour of her slinky custom Vuitton dress.
Zendaya
A human bouquet of roses in her strapless Valentino.

In This Chekhov Variation, It's Moscow in the Catskills: [Review]

Full text: Parker Posey stars in "The Seagull/Woodstock, NY," as Chekhov comes to the Catskills.
With so many Chekhov adaptations on the market, it's fair to wonder whether the Dramatists Guild requires playwrights to crank them out as a condition of membership.
If so, "The Seagull" is apparently the recommended source -- appearing more often than "The Cherry Orchard," "Three Sisters" and "Uncle Vanya" combined. The 1896 tragicomedy about the hopelessness of love and theater has set off a flock of homages and spoofs, often in one booby-trapped package.
That most of the adaptations don't stick doesn't matter; since opening night, little has been heard from "Drowning Crow," "Stupid ____ Bird," "A Seagull in the Hamptons" or even "The Notebook of Trigorin," Tennessee Williams's 1981 stab. What counts, at least as far as selling the show is concerned, is the mash-up of a classic title with a modern sensibility, so that troikas and patronyms become sports cars and upspeak.
The first question to ask in approaching these rehashes is: Do they make any sense if you don't know the source? The second question is: Do they add any worth if you do?
"The Seagull/Woodstock, NY," Thomas Bradshaw's entry in the reincarnation sweepstakes, clears the first bar, with maybe a trailing foot, in a New Group production that opened on Tuesday at the Pershing Square Signature Center. Airlifting the story from a 19th-century Russian estate to a 21st-century Catskills compound makes sense, and Chekhov's artsy, spoiled, lovestruck characters are more or less at home in a world of soy milk, Prada sneakers and pans in The New York Times.
These characters, mostly renamed with English soundalikes, constellate pretty much as the original 10 did. (Some workers on the estate have apparently been fired.) Their North Star, Irene, played by Parker Posey, is a moderately successful and immoderately self-involved actress who is "theater famous, not famous famous." Posey, that former indie "it girl," is perfectly cast as a woman who has won one Tony but can say with light sincerity, "I do need another one."
Along with her lover, the middlebrow novelist William (Ato Essandoh), Irene has returned from the city to visit her ailing friend, Samuel (David Cale), and her sensitive yet untalented son, Kevin (Nat Wolff). Kevin is in love with Nina (Aleyse Shannon), a neighbor's daughter who stars in the play he plans to present to the assembled company. But Nina is in love with William, while another family adjunct, Sasha (Hari Nef), is in love with Kevin.
There are yet more triangles and quadrilaterals of affection, not always clearly mapped in Bradshaw's vigorous trimming of the text. (Even so, Scott Elliott's production is a bit pokey, running 2 hours and 35 minutes.) But you do get the gist: Everyone wants someone they cannot have, and privilege breeds discontent.
Whether Bradshaw's "Seagull" also passes the second test for such adaptations -- does the new version add any value beyond what the original offers? -- may depend on whether you admire his work in the first place. His kind of theater, he has said, is about asking audiences to "question their own reactions" even if they are "outraged" as a result. This he has faithfully done in plays like "Fulfillment," "Intimacy," and "Burning," which depict, often explicitly, incest, pornography, scatology and sadomasochism.
There's a lot of that in his "Seagull" too. Kevin's ridiculous play -- in the Chekhov a gassy symbolist fantasy -- is more literally gassy here, as Nina extols the virtues of public farting. Its climax comes when, having asked audience members to share their "most recent masturbation experience," she rewards the best answer with the chance to watch hers. With unusual delicacy for a Bradshaw play, this is staged in a tub behind a curtain.
But mostly he translates the bad behavior of Chekhov's characters to snark instead of smut. Take the famous opening salvo of the original "Seagull," in which Masha is asked by Medvedenko, the poor schoolteacher who loves her, why she dresses all in black. Her ruefully funny answer -- "I'm in mourning for my life" -- becomes something merely nasty when Sasha, as she is now called, tells the rechristened Mark (Patrick Foley), "at least I don't buy my clothes at Walmart."
If the play, with all its cattiness and cruelty, at times feels like "Mean Girls Goes to Camp," it's not always clear where the meanness is coming from. When Sasha or Irene cut someone down, as they frequently do with generous heaps of obscenity, Nef and Posey subtly show us that they're mostly self-medicating with insults.
But other times it seems as if no one, or perhaps just the popular yet perennially panned Bradshaw, is behind the rancor. It's no accident that the names of the holies casually sideswiped in the rush of dialogue are mostly theatrical: Arthur Miller, Tracy Letts, "How I Learned to Drive," Terrence McNally, Nora Ephron and Janet McTeer in an "all-female 'True West."'
Grinding axes can be funny, and several times I caught myself guffawing in public, then regretting it privately. Though that's probably just where Bradshaw wants us, the easy laughs don't really provide added value; over time, they're more subtractive.
But then two things happen.
One is that the play opens a new line of inquiry as Nina (who is biracial) and William (who is multiracial) explore the way identity inflects their art and ambition. "Interracial children are the glue that will one day bond our sad, broken country," William says. To which Nina responds flirtatiously, "I don't know. I think Black people should stick together."
This is the kind of alteration that enhances the original, giving a familiar relationship a different dimension.
And then in its second half, the play changes again. Instead of looting or even building on Chekhov, it is drawn into the immense depth of his writing and becomes, at least fitfully, "The Seagull" itself. The tender scene in which Irene redresses, in both senses, her son's wounds -- he's tried to kill himself -- works exactly as it always does, no matter that it involves a conversational detour to P.S. 122. And the play's infallible final gesture, here involving rude Scrabble instead of bingo, once again doesn't fail.
Still, I'm left to wonder whether a few moments of enhanced relevance are worth the bother of a comprehensive and often counterproductive update. Couldn't this cast have pulled off the standard edition? And pulled it off more smoothly, without the staging longueurs occasioned by the rough text and the stop-and-go direction? (But do keep the fabulous contemporary clothing by Qween Jean.)
Short of fulfilling a union requirement, there's no reason for playwrights to keep pickpocketing Chekhov. Though as I write that I realize: That's what we all do anyway.

NEW YORK — With so many Anton Chekhov adaptations on the market, it’s fair to wonder whether the Dramatists Guild requires playwrights to crank them out as a condition of membership.
If so, “The Seagull” is apparently the recommended source — appearing more often than “The Cherry Orchard,” “Three Sisters” and “Uncle Vanya” combined. The 1896 tragicomedy about the hopelessness of love and theater has set off a flock of homages and spoofs, often in one booby-trapped package.
That most of the adaptations don’t stick doesn’t matter; since opening night, little has been heard from “Drowning Crow,” “Stupid ____ Bird,” “A Seagull in the Hamptons” or even “The Notebook of Trigorin,” Tennessee Williams’ 1981 stab. What counts, at least as far as selling the show is concerned, is the mashup of a classic title with a modern sensibility, so that troikas and patronyms become sports cars and upspeak.
The first question to ask in approaching these rehashes is: Do they make any sense if you don’t know the source? The second question is: Do they add any worth if you do?
“The Seagull/Woodstock, NY,” Thomas Bradshaw’s entry in the reincarnation sweepstakes, clears the first bar, with maybe a trailing foot, in a New Group production that opened Tuesday at the Pershing Square Signature Center. Airlifting the story from a 19th-century Russian estate to a 21st-century Catskills compound makes sense, and Chekhov’s artsy, spoiled, lovestruck characters are more or less at home in a world of soy milk, Prada sneakers and pans in The New York Times.
These characters, mostly renamed with English soundalikes, constellate pretty much as the original 10 did. (Some workers on the estate have apparently been fired.) Their North Star, Irene, played by Parker Posey, is a moderately successful and immoderately self-involved actress who is “theater famous, not famous famous.” Posey, that former indie “it girl,” is perfectly cast as a woman who has won one Tony but can say with light sincerity, “I do need another one.”
Along with her lover, middlebrow novelist William (Ato Essandoh), Irene has returned from the city to visit her ailing friend, Samuel (David Cale), and her sensitive yet untalented son, Kevin (Nat Wolff). Kevin is in love with Nina (Aleyse Shannon), a neighbor’s daughter who stars in the play he plans to present to the assembled company. But Nina is in love with William, while another family adjunct, Sasha (Hari Nef), is in love with Kevin.
There are yet more triangles and quadrilaterals of affection, not always clearly mapped in Bradshaw’s vigorous trimming of the text. (Even so, Scott Elliott’s production is a bit pokey, running 2 hours and 35 minutes.) But you do get the gist: Everyone wants someone they cannot have, and privilege breeds discontent.
Whether Bradshaw’s “Seagull” also passes the second test for such adaptations — does the new version add any value beyond what the original offers? — may depend on whether you admire his work in the first place. His kind of theater, he has said, is about asking audiences to “question their own reactions” even if they are “outraged” as a result. This he has faithfully done in plays like “Fulfillment,” “Intimacy” and “Burning,” which depict, often explicitly, incest, pornography, scatology and sadomasochism.
There’s a lot of that in his “Seagull” too. Kevin’s ridiculous play — in the Chekhov, a gassy symbolist fantasy — is more literally gassy here, as Nina extols the virtues of public farting. Its climax comes when, having asked audience members to share their “most recent masturbation experience,” she rewards the best answer with the chance to watch hers. With unusual delicacy for a Bradshaw play, this is staged in a tub behind a curtain.
But mostly he translates the bad behavior of Chekhov’s characters to snark instead of smut. Take the famous opening salvo of the original “Seagull,” in which Masha is asked by Medvedenko, the poor schoolteacher who loves her, why she dresses all in black. Her ruefully funny answer — “I’m in mourning for my life” — becomes something merely nasty when Sasha, as she is now called, tells the re-christened Mark (Patrick Foley), “at least I don’t buy my clothes at Walmart.”
If the play, with all its cattiness and cruelty, at times feels like “Mean Girls Goes to Camp,” it’s not always clear where the meanness is coming from. When Sasha or Irene cut someone down, as they frequently do with generous heaps of obscenity, Nef and Posey subtly show us that they’re mostly self-medicating with insults.
But other times it seems as if no one, or perhaps just the popular yet perennially panned Bradshaw, is behind the rancor. It’s no accident that the names of the holies casually sideswiped in the rush of dialogue are mostly theatrical: Arthur Miller, Tracy Letts, “How I Learned to Drive,” Terrence McNally, Nora Ephron and Janet McTeer in an “all-female ‘True West.’”
Grinding axes can be funny, and several times I caught myself guffawing in public, then regretting it privately. Although that’s probably just where Bradshaw wants us, the easy laughs don’t really provide added value; over time, they’re more subtractive.
But then two things happen.
One is that the play opens a new line of inquiry as Nina (who is biracial) and William (who is multiracial) explore the way identity inflects their art and ambition. “Interracial children are the glue that will one day bond our sad, broken country,” William says. To which Nina responds flirtatiously, “I don’t know. I think Black people should stick together.”
This is the kind of alteration that enhances the original, giving a familiar relationship a different dimension.
And then in its second half, the play changes again. Instead of looting or even building on Chekhov, it is drawn into the immense depth of his writing and becomes, at least fitfully, “The Seagull” itself. The tender scene in which Irene redresses, in both senses, her son’s wounds — he’s tried to kill himself — works exactly as it always does, no matter that it involves a conversational detour to P.S. 122. And the play’s infallible final gesture, here involving rude Scrabble instead of bingo, once again doesn’t fail.
Still, I’m left to wonder whether a few moments of enhanced relevance are worth the bother of a comprehensive and often counterproductive update. Couldn’t this cast have pulled off the standard edition? And pulled it off more smoothly, without the staging longueurs occasioned by the rough text and the stop-and-go direction? (But do keep the fabulous contemporary clothing by Qween Jean.)
Short of fulfilling a union requirement, there’s no reason for playwrights to keep pickpocketing Chekhov. Although as I write that I realize: That’s what we all do anyway.

Wanted: A Discreet Drudge to Art: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Emily Colucci, a freelance art writer, "constantly, mindlessly" browses the online job listings hosted by the nonprofit New York Foundation for the Arts -- and recently she found a doozy.
The ad, seeking a full-time "Executive/Personal Assistant" with "a high level of discretion," had been posted by an anonymous but high-profile "Art World Family." It was that phrase that first caught Colucci's eye: "I thought it might have been a child-care service," she explained. But the ad itself combined a tone so blithe with a detailed list of tasks so unreasonable that Colucci quickly posted it to the blog she co-founded, Filthy Dreams, under the title "I Found It: The Worst Art Job Listing Ever Created."
And what made the blog post immediately catch fire across the internet was that it was only slightly crazier than the sorts of jobs many young people -- the overeducated assistants, the underemployed M.F.A.s, all the well-dressed hordes of the exploited -- already put up with to get a toehold in what looks like the glamour of the art world.
For starters, the lucky candidate would expect to work "in a dynamic, unstructured environment and possess flexibility to change course at a moment's notice."
Among many other domestic chores, the aspiring subordinate would "serve as the central point of communication to household staff (includes chef, nannies, landscapers, dog walkers, housekeeper, contractors, and building managers)," but also be left alone with the couple's 4-year-old. Clothes would need to be picked up from "high end" stores, and one could expect to "coordinate all cleaning, repairs, and guest stays." Do you have a green thumb? You'll need one: The post requires "apartment rooftop garden maintenance."
He or she would make restaurant reservations, R.S.V.P. to events, and "create detailed travel itineraries for family to follow" for domestic or international excursions -- passports to hotels to airport escorts. (Oh, and manage travel bookings for members of the artist's studio, too.)
But the point that really stayed with Colucci was the ad's one-sentence synopsis of the job requirements: "The ideal candidate must be dedicated to a simple goal: make life easier for the couple in every way possible."
"It's just a total lack of self-awareness," she said. "So of course I saw it and I laughed, 'cause it's hilarious."
The listing itself was quickly taken down, but Colucci had uploaded the pdf. As it pinged from one reader to another, people argued about which aspect of the job, which offered to pay " $ 65,000 to $ 95,000," was funniest or most insulting. The most frequently singled out absurdity was the phrase "Manage dog systems," which included "potty breaks, food, day care, dog walkers, vet appts," and helping the studio assistant with in-house cats.
Melanie Martin, director of sales and communications for the N.Y.F.A., said that employees vet listings daily as they are submitted. "We check that job listings adhere to relevant labor laws, including, but not limited to, the inclusion of a salary range," she said, adding that this specific listing was never flagged. The organization did not respond when asked to identify the poster.
"Many people thought it was an art world parody," said Noah Becker, an artist and the publisher of Whitehot Magazine. He said it brought to mind a gory satire of the art world he had seen on Netflix, "a Zoolander version of the art world -- 'Velvet Buzzsaw."'
But if it had been posted "as a goof," said Melissa Stern, an artist and journalist, it was by someone "who knows this world quite intimately."
Emily Mae Smith, a painter who sometimes uses as many as three assistants in her own studio, said she found the ad "completely bonkers."
She was especially struck by the amount of detail. "'We want you to be a personal assistant, we want you to be an executive assistant, but we also want you to do all kinds of liaising with our staff,' which sounds to me like three jobs. Oh, and babysitting?"
But plenty of people found it all too plausible.
Emmy Thelander, an artist and adjunct professor at City University of New York, said it wasn't the job's requirements but their obsessive enumeration that was hardest to swallow. "What's ridiculous," she said, "is that they felt the need to spell out all the belittling things that role implies."
Rebecca Greene, a film producer who once was a personal assistant to a Hollywood A-lister, said, "The tasks aren't that uncommon for what someone of a high-caliber financial situation would want. It's just not typically written out that way, which is sort of intense."
Like many others, Greene also found the salary range low for a job that, by her reckoning, should pay at least $ 150,000 in New York.
Soren Stockman, a poet and performer who works as an executive assistant, found it unlikely that any applicants would collect a full year's salary, anyway. "That's a job where, if you're hired, it's a countdown to being fired," he said. "This person wants to never be affected by anything irritating. There's no way to fill that need for someone."
Colucci said, "It's a microcosm of what goes on in the art world and in a lot of cultural industries. People with a lot of power, and a lot of money, that are basically able to hire a lot of underlings, underpaid, probably young. It's very clear you're going to be abused in this role in some shape or form."
Of course, it's exactly that kind of abuse that leads to successful books and films like "The Nanny Diaries" and "The Devil Wears Prada" -- which may be something that the "Art Family" had in mind when they added that "a nondisclosure agreement must be signed upon hire."

Snow Sports At a Climate Crossroads: [Style Desk]

Full text: On Feb. 1, 2021, during the biggest blizzard to hit New York City in five years, snowboarders turned city spots into their playground. Hollis DuPre, 23, grinded rails at 30 Rockefeller Plaza. Jayell White, a 30-year-old Bronx native, popped off a brick wall in Battery Park.
All of this was documented in the first film produced by Hell Gate, a scrappy snowboard crew. Last year, the crew's second video, "Gate 2 Hell," started on a far gloomier note. Trung Nguyen, 29, hiked up a mound of road salt. At the top, he dropped in and slid down the sodium chloride.
Cooper Winterson, a 28-year-old Hell Gate rider, said Mr. Nguyen's trick "plays out as an ironic metaphor for what we're dealing with. We don't have enough snow to get clips, so we're snowboarding on salt," which, he pointed out, is used to combat snowstorms.
New York City is in a snow drought. Hell Gate's members have had to travel instead to Buffalo, Albany and Poughkeepsie -- or to Big Snow, billed America's first and only indoor snow arena, at the American Dream mall in East Rutherford, N.J. The sealed slope ensures that, according to its website, "every day is a snow day."
This message is cheerily reinforced by the mountain's yeti mascot, who, on a recent Sunday, was seen twerking near the chair lift as house music played over echoey loudspeakers. Big Snow opened in 2019, and its everlasting winter has been repeatedly disrupted, first by the pandemic and then because of an electrical fire that broke out inside the 180,000-square-foot dome.
As climate change rewires the world's weather patterns, skiers and snowboarders -- along with the companies that outfit them -- are pondering a future without snow.
"Our season is certainly shorter than it was in the past," said Ali Kenney, 44, the chief strategy officer for Burton Snowboards. "Before, you could depend on a Thanksgiving and Christmas rush. Now, most of our activity is January to March."
Over the coming decades, winter's window is expected to shrink even more. One recent study led by researchers at the University of Waterloo warned that, by 2100, only one of the 21 previous Winter Olympics locations will have enough snow and ice to reliably host the Games. In response, many snow sports companies are diversifying. Salomon, once known for skis, has largely become an outfitter of running shoes, while Lib Tech, a snowboard manufacturer, now also makes surfboards. Burton, the company that pioneered and popularized snowboarding, is viewed as the sport's leader. It has nurtured the sport in important ways, including by helping bring snowboarding into the Olympics, and then supporting many Olympic snowboarders.
The company is now fighting to keep its cherished (and most profitable) season alive, but is also forced to hedge for the heat. Though it wants to save snowboarding, it also knows it needs to transcend it. Burton is attempting this tricky balance through a combination of environmental practices, promoting policies to protect winter, and efforts to diversify and expand snowboarding, which has long been dominated by a white and largely affluent ridership. 'We Cannot Ignore It'
In 1977, Jake Burton Carpenter founded Burton out of his Vermont barn. Donna Carpenter now owns the company, taking it over after her husband's death in 2019. In August of last year, Bloomberg reported that the private, family-owned company was exploring a sale, though Ms. Carpenter later denied it.
The Green Mountains in Vermont are far smaller than the peaks out west, but the state has been credited with popularizing snowboarding. In 1983, Stratton Mountain, in southern Vermont, became the first resort to welcome snowboarders, then developed training programs for them. The idea for the gravity-defying halfpipe -- a long U-shaped feature, borrowed from skateboarding, that flings snowboarders high into the air -- was developed in the state. Many of the sport's top athletes were reared there, too.
Through the aughts, Vermont winters were reliably cold, and snowstorms were common. Each time 24 or more inches fell, Mr. Carpenter gave his employees in Burlington, Vt., the day off to hit the slopes.
Now a new form of winter is taking hold, one plagued by warm snaps and rain. A recent assessment from the University of Vermont warned that, by 2080, the state's ski season could be shortened by a month. As good storms become less reliable, Burton has loosened its snow day rules, and now shuts down if a foot or more is projected.
"There's a lot less energy around here when no one is feeling like they can get out and ride and experience the feeling that we are all seeking," Ms. Kenney said. "The positive is that it increases the energy and commitment around our climate work. But it's hard for it not to take a toll emotionally."
The University of Vermont also studies snow's shifting qualities. Kate Hale, a snow hydrologist at the university, said that light fluffy powder will become rarer as winters become more volatile. "Champagne powder requires consistently cold temperatures," said Dr. Hale, 31.
Jeremy Jones, 48, a legendary backcountry rider, is torn up over a future without powder, which he described in almost spiritual terms. "It's this weightless, effortless descent," he said. "You're barely connected to the earth."
Mr. Jones carved his first turns at his childhood home on a board aptly named the Burton Backhill. Danny Davis, 34, a Burton rider and former Olympian, grew up on a Kmart board in his Michigan yard. Zeb Powell, a 23-year-old Burton pro, credits his mesmerizing bag of tricks to the Cataloochee Ski Area, a modest North Carolina mountain that, because of its limited features, forced him to be unconventional.
Low-altitude (and generally cheaper) slopes incubated talent and improvisation. This advanced the snowboarding's countercultural flair, known as "steez," a term popularized by the rapper Method Man that's used to hail a snowboarder's blend of style and ease. As snow migrates to ever higher elevations, accessible paths into the sport start to disappear, leaving only the biggest and most expensive resorts.
"I don't know if today I'd be able to learn in my front yard," Mr. Davis said. "The snow just doesn't stick around Michigan like it used to."
Much of the world is facing similar issues. Dachstein, a receding Austrian glacier where the 2022 Olympic gold medalist Anna Gasser honed her skills, closed for this entire season. Snowboarders see climate change up close, said Ms. Gasser, 31: "We cannot ignore it."
In 2011, Ms. Kenney traveled across Europe and produced a troubling report on the future of the snowboarding industry there. She spent the next six months drafting plans for a sustainability program within Burton. She pitched them to Ms. Carpenter, who deputized her to overhaul company procedures.
Because Burton is family owned, Ms. Kenney said this work has been unencumbered by a "fiduciary duty to pursue profits at all costs," adding that Burton's efforts to become climate positive are costing millions in revenue each year.
Ms. Kenney is also mulling support for research on future snow patterns. These days, Burton makes conservative inventory estimates, then transports gear to places that have snow. This year, that's been Japan and much of the American West, with even the temperate climate of Southern California experiencing rare blizzard conditions in and around the area.
At the same time, the East Coast and much of Europe is suffering. While Switzerland has been plagued by historically warm temperatures, Utah's snowpack is 170 percent of the average, which, while generally appreciated, has also created avalanche risks and infrastructure headaches that have led to some temporary resort closures.
In 2013, Burton became the biggest financial backer to Protect Our Winters (POW), an advocacy group focused on climate policy founded by Mr. Jones in 2007. That same year, in a seemingly practical calculation, the company started its first spring/summer collection, which "captures the spirit of snowboarding in styles for hot days and long nights."
In 2019, Burton became snowboarding's first certified B corporation, a rigorous designation based on intense observation of company practices that followed years of work to balance profit, purpose and environmental accountability. It has introduced refurbishment and resale programs, and overhauled its supply chain with an eye toward sustainability.
With Burton's blessing, riders, including Mr. Davis, have lobbied Capitol Hill lawmakers. Many are Republicans representing communities used to the cold and snow, including Representative John Curtis, Republican of Utah, a POW ally and founding member of the Conservative Climate Caucus who has used America's bipartisan love of winter sports to push climate policies. Last year, he went hiking in his Utah district with POW athletes.
Mr. Davis said winter's disappearance would "be so much more dire than sliding on snow," invoking the specter of water shortages. "Snow is critical to humanity whether you like it or not."
POW has also used its platform to call out those it sees as obstacles, including Jay Kemmerer, the owner of Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, who has adopted green resort practices -- like renewable energy and water conservation habits -- while also supporting politicians who deny climate change. Other snow resorts have also donated to climate-change deniers. (Earlier this month, 200 athletes signed a POW letter demanding that the International Ski and Snowboard Federation do far more to fight climate change.)
Ms. Kenney is also frustrated by some of Burton's corporate peers. "Many companies are owned by private equity or a big holding company," she said. "If snowboarding starts to decline, their reaction is, 'Let's just get out of that sport or sell that brand."' (While snowboarders and skiers have long had a frosty relationship -- largely because ski resorts long banned snowboarders from their terrain -- Ms. Kenney praised Atomic, the world's largest ski maker, which earlier this month announced a POW partnership, alongside efforts to adopt green company practices.)
At the same time, high-end fashion houses have ventured into the industry. Saint Laurent, Louis Vuitton and Dior are making luxe snowboards and outerwear for the sport. The U.S. Olympian Julia Marino won a silver medal at the 2022 Olympics on a Prada board. In 2016, Trevor Andrews, a Burton rider, was hired by Gucci to make his bootleg "GucciGhost" designs official. That same year, Burton collaborated with Jeff Koons to design a snowboard.
Tucker Zink is the general manager for Darkside Snowboards in Vermont, which operates three stores that have expanded to carry skateboarding and mountain biking gear. His store is now supplying more expensive options to attract high-fashion customers, many of whom flocked to resort towns during the pandemic. But in an attempt to protect snowboarding's proletariat, Darkside has also built the "Dark Park," located behind its Killington store, which offers day and nighttime riding, for free.
A Faint Smell of Plastic
Burton opened its first New York store in SoHo in 2005 on the corner of Spring and Mercer Streets. It featured a "cold room" where customers could test outerwear in frigid conditions. The store has since moved to a new outpost, on Greene Street. It may be the only place in the city where you can get a board waxed, and is a stop for OVRRIDE, a company that shuttles urbanites to the snowy north. It's also an unofficial gathering place for the city's snowboarding diaspora.
As Burton tries to branch out, the company has various programs to support new riders, with a particular focus on bringing Black snowboarders to the mountain. Selema Masekela, 51, a longtime X Games host and Burton board member, is helping lead these initiatives, which are informed by his decades of mistreatment on the mountain. "I got every sort of look and verbal thing thrown at me," he said.
The late Virgil Abloh, an avid snowboarder, designed Burton collections in 2018 and 2022. These lines fueled the company's efforts to introduce the sport to people of color, most notably through the Chill program, which says it has introduced the sport to thousands of people, chiefly by subsidizing the costs to get up on the slopes and learn.
One of those athletes is Brolin Mawejji, 30, who started snowboarding as a boy after landing in Massachusetts as a Ugandan refugee. In 2022, he became the first snowboarder to represent his country in the Winter Olympics. He said that amid the trauma and instability of his childhood, "snowboarding gave me inner peace." On a drizzly evening earlier this month, Burton's SoHo store hosted a party for its new collaboration with the rap group Run DMC. The collection was spearheaded by T.J. and Jesse Mizell, two sons of Jam Master Jay, the group's D.J., who was fatally shot in 2002.
The Mizells said they hoped their line would encourage more Black people to get into snowboarding, or at least borrow the sport's style. "We want to see people walking through SoHo in Burton being like, 'I've never ridden a snowboard before, but this tech is insane," said T.J. Mizell, 31.
Perhaps the most hyped-up rider at the event was LJ Henriquez, a 14-year-old prodigy from New Jersey who largely built his skills at Big Snow's mall hill, which is more accessible than most mountains, relatively cheap and offers eerily consistent conditions. The short and narrow slope is dotted with fake Christmas trees and illuminated by harsh fluorescent flood lighting. It's stocked with rows of industrial-grade air-conditioners and has a faint smell of plastic.
"You're missing the birds and the trees and the sun, which is weird," said Brian Burke, a 31-year-old from Maine, who waited in the Big Snow line while a cheerleading competition wrapped up in the atrium below. The pro snowboarder Mr. Powell, after his own recent visit, leaned into Big Snow's bizarre locale by snowboarding down a mall escalator.
There's also a clear difference between feathery natural snow and its fabricated form. Each real crystal is beautiful and unique, while the fabricated stuff is akin to chopped ice.

Full text: The most eye-catching shows, the biggest parties and the newest talents to watch. Here is what turned heads in London this season.
LONDON -- Farms aren't normally a source of stylistic inspiration for the upper echelons of fashion. But at London Fashion Week, it felt as if some designers had barnyards on the brain.
Simone Rocha had hay fever -- she packed her sheer layered skirts with similar-looking stuff -- and Christopher Kane offered tops and column gowns with kitschy AI-generated prints of pigs, chicks and rats. S.S. Daley presented knits with one of his favorite recurring motifs -- the duck -- as did Daniel Lee, whose debut collection for Burberry was filled with wacky mallard prints, feathery fronds and a knitted duck bonnet with a beak and legs. Why?
"Because ducks are so British and associated with rain," Mr. Lee said after the show.
As Britain continues to grapple with its ongoing national identity crisis, the turn to familiar terrain -- think English eccentricity and the green and pleasant land -- should perhaps not feel surprising. But there was also more to this season than that.
Beyond the big Burberry reveal, here are some of the week's most memorable moments.
Stylized sexuality for women -- by women -- was a major moment ...
Dilara Findikoglu has become one of the must-see shows in London in recent seasons. The Turkish-British designer uses her clothes to explore ideas of defiant female sexuality and emancipation, often with a witchy twist. Her latest collection, inspired in part by the women's protest movement in Iran, weaponized the female body in a push and pull between armor and undress, climaxing in a gothic finale dress with a superimposed skirt and bodice made from gleaming silver knives.
Ms. Findikoglu is part of a movement redefining sexy dressing for the female gaze. Those designers include Dimitra Petsa, whose Di Petsa show featured wet-look illusion dresses inspired by Greek goddesses, and Karoline Vitto, part of the Fashion East talent incubator, who built confidently on her size-inclusive philosophy using signatures like metal inserts and cutouts. Also, see Nensi Dojaka, who presented more of her lingerie-cum-ready-to-wear with a new level of creative accomplishment and commercial savvy.
... as were florals for fall.
Florals for spring are famously not groundbreaking, as any fan of "The Devil Wears Prada" would know. Perhaps that's why plenty of London designers had them out on the runways for fall instead.
Few went quite as far as Richard Quinn, for whom florals are a style hallmark and whose set was so laden with blooms on and off the runway that guests were encouraged to make bouquets to take away after the show. Emilia Wickstead offset her grungy "Twin Peaks"-inspired collection with some posy prints, and Erdem, preoccupied this season with fallen women of Georgian London, offered ghostly glamour with trompe l'oeil greenery that wound its way across his jewel-tone taffeta skirts.
The Chinese designer Susan Fang made us stop and smell the roses -- literally -- with a runway of crushed petals and delicately beaded looks in pastel shades that shimmered and danced with what looked like crystallized droplets. Courtesy of her dad, who works for Shanghai's fire safety department, Ms. Fang also created rose-scented dresses with water-mist wings that sprayed scent as the models walked.
Moncler brought the stars out ...
This season, the most celebrity sightings were not at a runway front row. Instead, Justin and Hailey Bieber, Serena Williams, Lewis Hamilton and Charli XCX could be found at the gargantuan "Art of Genius" presentation hosted by Moncler after the Burberry show. The Italian brand best known for pricey puffer jackets blew the budget on the London iteration of its Genius project, in which Moncler enlists designers and guest artists to reimagine its trademark outerwear, which then is revealed to the thousands of fans who have signed up for free tickets to the event.
They could go to a foam party hosted by Palm Angels; record songs in booths by Jay-Z's Roc Nation; play with robots that respond to human interaction, courtesy of the Japanese label FRGMT; or listen to Alicia Keys, who played a live set. Also there? Pharrell Williams, fresh from his appointment last week as the new creative director of men's wear at Louis Vuitton.
... and two British actors made the runways a stage.
February is not just a time of fashion shows. It's also Hollywood awards season, meaning that actors and actresses are busy cruising red carpets rather than popping up at runway shows. Except, it would appear, for Florence Pugh.
The British star didn't just show her face at the Harris Reed show last week, the first on the London Fashion Week calendar. She opened the entire affair, emerging into the round in a sparkling harlequin dress with a black corset, slithering cutaways and a huge halo-like topper.
"In a sometimes judgmental world, our costumes can change who we want to be seen as and who we are destined to be," Ms. Pugh declared to the audience. Days later, at the BAFTA awards, she wore a luminous orange gown from Nina Ricci, where Mr. Reed is now the creative director. His debut collection for the house is to be unveiled in Paris next month.
Mr. Reed was not the only talent to harness some serious thespian energy. At S.S. Daley, Ian McKellen emerged from the shadows in a sailor's cap and peacoat for a raspy recital of Tennyson's "The Coming of Arthur." Anna Wintour, famously a fan of the West End, smiled serenely as the performance unfolded at her feet.
Some designers tested the boundaries of taste.
Christopher Kane has always relished being a provocateur. This season, amid sweeping bustles and embroidered florals, he showed creepy dresses covered in AI-generated swarms of rats, chickens and piglets, which he later explained were for "those who desire clothes that challenge sartorial standards."
As more and more brands pivot toward a pared-back wearability, where would fashion be without those who continually push the envelope?
Mowalola Ogunlesi, the 27-year-old Nigerian designer who was handpicked by Kanye West to oversee the collaboration between his Yeezy brand and Gap, clearly thrives on straddling that line. Her "bumster" trousers came closer to "thighsters," alongside reworked parody corporate logos and an "insert disc here" dress with an arrow pointing toward the model's nether regions. (It was a collection inspired in part by the blurring of lines between life and tech.)
And so does Jonathan Anderson, whose success with his own line and with Loewe makes him a critical cornerstone of the London schedule. He doesn't wear that responsibility lightly. Nor was he afraid to plaster giant penises over billboards on his set or on graphic vinyl T-shirts -- part of a tribute to the choreographer Michael Clark in an exploration of fandom -- giving his show additional frisson.
And Simone Rocha made "hay."
The whimsical romance and dark underbelly of Simone Rocha's clothes make her one of the highlights of the London calendar. This season, inspired by the historic Irish tradition of Lughnasadh, a Gaelic harvest festival, she sent out models with delicate ribbon bows on their cheekbones or trailing from their fingertips. They wore skirt suits in crinkled gold cloqué or gleaming black leather and puffy tulle dresses and skirts that gained extra volume thanks to layers of loose raffia.
Ms. Rocha isn't easy to categorize, nor does she want to be. Much like Molly Goddard, she of the supersize ruffle dresses who this season invited guests over to her East London studio to sample skirts in more modest shapes, Ms. Rocha designs for women (and men) like her. In other words, those who are quietly determined to do things their way.

How to Score a Vintage Handbag: [Style Desk]

Full text: What's a good deal? Where should you look?
The ubiquity of certain "it" handbags on social media can create a feeling of snow blindness when you're scrolling online. If you want to break out of that trend cycle, the solution is obvious: Get a vintage bag.
This is a wild and exciting world to dive into! It's also overwhelming. Allow me to talk you through it. You'll want to take your time, familiarize yourself with sellers' authentication guarantees, do research on serial numbers, get a lay of the land on competitive pricing and learn to understand the subtleties of how sellers describe the conditions of their goods. Sounds exhausting but trust me, it's worth it.
You should know things like what Prada calls its nylon (tessuto) and the name of Bottega Veneta's woven leather (intrecciato). Never hesitate to ask questions or request more photos -- advice that also applies to life in general.
For our purposes, we're using a loose definition of vintage: at least a decade old. There are many, many, many strategies for shopping for vintage bags. One way is to frequent vintage shops that carry a lot of bags. Check out What Goes Around Comes Around in New York and Beverly Hills, Calif., or Dina C's Fab & Funky Consignment Boutique in Palm Beach, Fla. (a.k.a., destination shopping heaven). Browse by designer at a resale site like ReBag or Fashionphile. Visit super-specific destinations like ClosetfullofCoco on Instagram, which sells Chanel exclusively -- and almost all of it bags.
If you need something to do after eating lunch and before returning to work, browsing Christie's Collection of André Leon Talley is a solid use of your time. Mr. Talley was not just a fashion historian and writer but a real shopper. While few can attend the live auction on Feb. 15, and fewer can place a winning bid on a beige ponyhair Chanel bag or a black Ralph Lauren alligator duffel, looking at the collection can inspire your own vintage bag rabbit hole.
Satin is one of my favorite materials for bags, especially small evening bags with drawstrings or fringe. Renaud Pellegrino's bright pink satin bag would be ideal for a night at the ballet, maybe. Also, look for materials that were often used in past decades, like tortoiseshell, resin or Bakelite.
Or you might try looking for earlier pieces from your favorite labels. Search for Kate Spade from the early aughts when some of the bags were made in Italy. You can find wonderful Tom Ford-era Gucci or Yves Saint Laurent bags. Ditto Louis Vuitton bags in Epi leather, a Vuitton-specific creation that's textured with tiny wavy ridges.
Another way to search is by looking for bag shapes that were all the rage before your time. I like to search for frame bags or top handle bags; the Céline clasp bag from just a few years ago is a favorite. For a treat, try minaudières, a whole world unto itself. Maybe a Judith Leiber egg?
Important note! You won't look costume-y if you wear any of these with normal clothes. But looking like you're in costume isn't always a bad thing.
Roberta di Camerino
A friend of mine who designs accessories loves to search for Sharif bags from the 1980s and Susan Gail bags for their high quality leather. Another classic is Roberta di Camerino, an Italian brand whose heyday was in the midcentury and whose bags are known for trompe l'oeil and color-blocking. Once you see the bags, you can't unsee their influence in other designers' work -- Prada, Gucci. There are a lot of bags around at an array of prices. I prefer the velvet to the vinyl and would wear it with thin wale corduroy pants. 640 euros; about $ 700
Mark Cross
For a certain kind of fashion fixated person, the biggest revelation in "Rear Window" was the box bag Grace Kelly's character carried. There are vintage versions of the bag on 1stdibs.com, but Mark Cross continues to make a smaller version of the bag that Gerald Murphy, who ran Mark Cross, designed in 1954 for the film, called the Rear Window Day Case. (Mr. Murphy and his wife, Sara, were significant Lost Generation figures, legendary for their time in the South of France.) I find the interior mirror completely charming. Black is practical, but who needs practical? Go with the celadon. $ 3,590
Hermès
The Birkin and the Kelly bags are more or less household names, but Hermès has a deep bench of lesser known styles: Picotin, Chevreuse, Chaîne D'Ancre, Cordelière, Sandrine. "I think many overlook all of the wonderful styles Hermès had in the '60s," said Zabrina Estrada, who owns Etéreo Vintage in Brooklyn. "I love the Palonnier in a skin, and the Piano bag is also really chic." Her dream bag is the Mallette, which has a lockable compartment for jewelry. The Brooklyn Museum has one owned by Babe Paley that was donated by her social secretary! $ 13,000
Manolo Blahnik
I consider companies whose bags are less celebrated than other things they make a whole category of vintage. Bally fits in there, as does any bag from Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels, Nina Ricci, Fortuny and Ferragamo. Kudos to whoever gets this gold and pink metallic polka-dot Manolo clutch worthy of Cher Horowitz, Carrie Bradshaw or other '90s protagonists. $ 487.50
Chanel
Vintage Chanel bags go in a lot of directions. You could get a wild piece from one of its collections, like an $ 84,000 shopping basket from 2014 made out of the house's signature chains. Take it to the farmers' market? But as with Hermès, the elegant move would be a piece from the 1960s, like a chocolate brown Ottoman bag with a lipstick red lining. Why does red lining make everything better? 1,800 euros; about $ 1,960
Louis Vuitton
Skip all the Louis Vuitton logos, unless you're buying a trunk. Instead, go for simple. Sumptuous. Mysterious but privileged. I'm talking about Sofia Coppola! But specifically, the Louis Vuitton Sofia Coppola SC Bag Leather PM. The navy blue is classic. In fact, everything about this bag is classic. I'd be happy with any color -- light brown, cherry red, oxblood -- and it's large enough to carry a laptop, wallet, tiny notepad for deep thoughts, a bag of Doritos. You know, the essentials. $ 2,005

A 'White Lotus' Star Steps on the Runway: [Style Desk]

Full text: Jon Gries made a surprise appearance in the Eckhaus Latta show. He's not totally ready to give up on Tanya.
In the two months since the season finale of "The White Lotus" aired on HBO, Jon Gries has been on the receiving end of a lot of angry pointing in public.
"You," strangers have snarled at him in the street, Mr. Gries said, mimicking their outrage. And can you blame them? Viewers were left with the assumption -- spoiler alert -- that Greg had somehow helped orchestrate the attempted murder of his wife, Tanya, played with Peppa Pig-meets-Monica Vitti gravitas by the fan-favorite Jennifer Coolidge. (More on that plot point later.)
Yet his character's unfavorable audience score didn't stop Mr. Gries from making a very public appearance on Saturday night, cast as a model in Eckhaus Latta's fall 2023 show.
Mr. Gries is not the first "White Lotus" star to answer fashion's call. They've been seated in the front row at runway shows (Theo James and Will Sharpe, who played Cameron and Ethan, hit the Armani shows in Milan in January) and been cast in major fashion campaigns (Sydney Sweeney, one of Season 1's surly teens, models for Miu Miu, among other brands). But Mr. Gries is the first to be seen on the runway during New York Fashion Week, which began on Friday.
The Eckhaus Latta designers were connected to Mr. Gries through his girlfriend, who is a friend of the label and who suggested they work together, said one of the brand's founders, Zoe Latta. "We're so touched he wanted to do it," she said. "We were a little nervous that he would steal the show because he's major."
The New York Times chased down Mr. Gries backstage, where he was celebrating with his fellow models, to hear more about his debut on the runway -- where he wore a yellowish, abstract knit sweater, off-white linen pants and leather patchwork boots -- and the fate of Greg.
Why did you want to do this?
I liked their brand. They're independent, and I've always had pretty much an independent film career. I've been somewhat rogue, so it spoke to me. And also, look at the clothes -- they speak for themselves [gesturing to his boots]. They really are great. It's something I'd never done and something I wanted to try.
What direction were you given before you hit the runway?
They said, "You're walking down the streets of New York, and your mind is somewhere else." And I said, "You mean like you're listening to headphones?" And they said, "Exactly."
So you've never done this before, but are you a fashion guy?
Not really, no. I'm aware of it, but I buy old clothes. I wear only corduroy pants. But many, many years ago, I did a thing in Los Angeles magazine where I wore Prada. I remember putting on the pants, and they were lined, and they were so cozy. It was like, Oh, this is what first class is.
How have you felt about the reaction to the show? You were in the second season for only a few episodes, but you played a major sinister role. [To recap: Tanya died when she tumbled from a yacht. She'd become convinced that her new "high-end gay" travel companions, including a British man named Quentin, were colluding with Greg to kill her. She ended up shooting most everyone on the boat, using a gun from a duffel bag that also contained rope and duct tape, brought on board by her drug-dealing one-night stand, whom she'd met through Quentin. It's complicated.]
This is the beauty of Mike White [the show's creator]. It's also extremely subjective. This is what Tanya thinks. When Portia says to her, "Hey, something's afloat." Is it really?
OK: gun, rope, tape. Would they really need all that? All they've got to do is push her off the boat out in the ocean, and, "Oh, she fell overboard." You know what I mean? Mike is so crafty, how he kind of leaves it open. Even when she's doing the shooting, it's from her perspective because we're in her mind, and she thinks something's up.
Wait, are you saying Greg's innocent?
I'm not saying he's innocent, but let's just say, if this were in a court of law, would they really be able to prove intent? He wasn't there, number one. Number two, yes, maybe he suggested Sicily, and yes, maybe Quentin is his friend. But the purpose might have been to get her in a compromising position with that other guy.
But I go along with the crowd. I do think that there's something afoot.
Are you going to be in the next season?
That I don't know, honestly. Mike White does what Mike White does. When he was writing Season 2, I got a text from him -- that was how I found out. He said, Are you available? I said, Anytime, anywhere.
He could be going back in time, you never know. There's still a way to get Tanya in.
This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.

NEW YORK — In the two months since the season finale of “The White Lotus” aired on HBO, Jon Gries has been on the receiving end of a lot of angry pointing in public.

No. 2, yes, maybe he suggested Sicily, and yes, maybe Quentin is his friend. But the purpose might have been to get her in a compromising position with that other guy.
But I go along with the crowd. I do think that there’s something afoot.
Q: Are you going to be in the next season?
A: That I don’t know, honestly. Mike White does what Mike White does. When he was writing Season 2, I got a text from him — that was how I found out. He said, “Are you available?” I said, “Anytime, anywhere.”
He could be going back in time, you never know. There’s still a way to get Tanya in. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: The outfitter to Lily Collins and Sarah Jessica Parker can sell you a tutu or a pink merkin. In a new memoir she spills the tea.
Patricia Field likes looking back on a lifetime in fashion as a series of snapshots. In the late 1970s the rocker Patti Smith visited Ms. Field's shop on Eighth Street in Manhattan, a downtown mecca for club kids and outliers of varying stripes. "Her hair was disheveled, and her clothes were all wrinkled," Ms. Field recalled, "but she had on a full-length olive green mink, looking like royalty who'd fallen on hard times"
A couple of decades later, as costume designer for "Sex and the City," she was rifling through a discount bin in a Seventh Avenue showroom searching for just the right item for Sarah Jessica Parker to wear in the show's opening title sequence.
Soon enough, she unearthed a length of tulle that "peeked out like a frothy wave " Ms. Field said. "I pulled and out came this sort of chic white tutu."
Among her varied gifts is a near eidetic recall. "What impresses me stays with me," she said on a recent afternoon. It also animates her latest venture.
Artist, stylist and merchant turned costume designer, Ms. Field, 81, is about to add author to her catalog of credits. Her new memoir, "Pat in the City: My Life of Fashion, Style, and Breaking All the Rules," written with Rebecca Paley and out on Feb. 14, charts her trajectory from retail upstart and brazen participant in the underground ballroom culture (which gave birth to vogueing) to costume designer and audacious Hollywood influencer.
A keen-eyed chronicler of the downtown scene, she was one of the first New York merchants to sell underwear and neoprene togs as club wear. This was in the 1960s, '70s and '80s, and those outré items jostled for space alongside bedazzled merry widows, mesh tank tops, neon-colored wigs and merkins, dainty pubic wigs she showed poking from the tops of low-rise jeans.
The shop, which opened in 1971, famously served as a safe space for Ms. Field's surrogate family of young artists and self-proclaimed hedonists all flying their freak flag below 14th Street. Carol Channing, Ivana Trump and Madonna were among her clients. Ms. Field had Jean-Michel Basquiat, then known by the graffiti tag SAMO, scrawl designs on paper jumpsuits. In 2002, she closed the store, seeking greener pastures.
She diverted some of her formidable energy to her work as a costume designer, with a string of greatest hits that includes "The Devil Wears Prada" and the first two seasons of "Emily in Paris."
Much of her success, she would argue, is built on sheer audacity. She was able to sell the notion that Carrie Bradshaw, Ms. Parker's oversharing character, would actually wear a lace-up Heidi corset and dirndl skirt to a picnic in Central Park -- this over the eye rolling of her boss, Darren Star, the creator of the HBO series, which ran from 1998 to 2004.
"There were moments I panicked," Mr. Star said. "I told her, 'I can't hear the dialogue because the wardrobe is so loud."'
She did not think twice about draping Miranda Priestly, the editor in "The Devil Wears Prada," in a succession of overripe furs and giving her an outsize crocodile bag, and she was brash enough to dress the overreaching protagonist of "Emily in Paris" in a cartoonlike homage to Gallic chic. Emily's polarizing get-ups included an Eiffel Tower printed blouse, split-toe boots, a houndstooth beret and, perhaps most ringarde, a white eyelet Chanel crop top worn with jogging pants.
Emily's style, a jumble of clichés, ruffled viewer sensibilities, but mostly it irked critics, among them those at Vogue, where one writer dismissed her wardrobe as a "cringe-worthy trigger."
"I'm not making documentaries," Ms. Field said.
The prospect of writing tested Ms. Field's nerves. "I didn't want to sound uppity, I didn't want to sound pedantic," said the designer, who in her student days majored in government and philosophy at New York University. "I wanted the book to be my voice."
In an interview, that voice, slightly raspy, as if sifted through dry coffee grounds, betrayed no stress. She strolled into Patricia Field ARTFashion Gallery, her combined store and gallery on East Broadway, looking like an amalgam of punk royalty and slightly rough-edged Park Avenue matron. She wore a beat-up Pucci bomber jacket and purple tank showily stamped with a Balmain logo.
"It's very anti-something that I would never expect myself to buy, very anti-me, putting somebody's name across my chest," she said. "But something attracted me to it." She wore slim jeans and lime-colored loafers from Trash and Vaudeville, the fabled rock emporium on St. Marks Place. Her flame-colored hair cascaded past her shoulders.
Indeed, the only mild thing about her was the pack of yellow label American Spirit cigarettes that she placed like a talisman on table in front of her.
Her store is part of a residential complex where Ms. Field also lives. The ground-floor retail space teems with a violently colorful mash-up of hand-painted T-shirts by her friend Scooter LaForge, a painter and sculptor; sneakers embellished with what looked like cake frosting; and a poison-green breast-plated evening dress by the designer Kristina Gress. Inevitably there was a nameplate necklace, Carrie's familiar concession to bling on the series.
"That nameplate is the rent," Ms. Field noted dryly.
She thinks of herself as a merchant without borders, just as apt to dig up a conical bra at a fusty shop on Orchard Street, or pick up a haul of puffer jackets or Tyvek jumpsuits at a Las Vegas surplus show, as she is to score a fake fur chubby at the now defunct Century 21. At ARTFashion, she peruses her inventory with what looks like maternal affection.
"Lately we've been in Depression clothes, kind of loose and shapeless and faded," she said. She has never liked the look, she said, "the people who put holes in their $ 75 jeans."
That's over, she predicted. Going forward, we will be more formal, more considered, less studiedly haphazard. "It's not that you'll be throwing on a dumpy dress," she said.
Though Ms. Field may cringe to hear it, her followers revere her as a sage, a living repository of fashion history and canny purveyor of outsider style to the masses.
"Sex and the City" changed our wardrobes "forever," Harper's Bazaar gushed not long ago, applauding Ms. Field for encouraging the show's fans to follow Carrie's lead, mating a $ 5 dress with $ 500 shoes and to regard clashing prints, jungle patterns and, of course, those Manolos as not just acceptable but infinitely covetable.
That mixmaster aesthetic proved contagious, not to say prophetic. But encomiums make Ms. Field squirm. "I don't want to be like this special thing," she said. "I was actually a little taken aback when I became this guru, even though I handle it."
If you take her at her word, there is little she cannot handle. She inherited her gumption from her mother, Marika, a Greek-born dynamo who channeled her entrepreneurial instincts into a thriving dry cleaning business in Queens, embracing whatever fate tossed her way. And Ms. Field similarly welcomes change, partly as a bulwark against sadness.
She was 7 when her father died of tuberculosis. "I think it was my mother who gave me the strength and confidence to let my dad go," Ms. Field said. "She was the go-getter, always moving toward the next thing, and I took after her."
At work she aims to balance an untrammeled enthusiasm with professional levelheadedness. She does not particularly relate to her characters, much less to her clients, she said. But she relished dressing Lily Collins as Emily, finding her committed, eager and excitable.
"She encourages me to push fashion boundaries," Ms. Collins said. "Sometimes you just have to trust the process and not be afraid to mix and match. Sometimes more is really more."
Ms. Parker "is a diva," Ms. Field said with grudging respect, but she is a dream to dress. "Sarah Jessica loves fashion," she said, adding, "she has an eye."
On set or off, Ms. Field mostly follows her impulses, even the most contradictory, choosing romantic partners much in the way that she chooses a look, with a blithe eclecticism. Living with Barbara Dente, an influential stylist of the early '80s, opened up new worlds. "She was a minimalist before that was even a thing," Ms. Field writes in her book. "Her happy place was the Zoran showroom; mine was the junk show in Las Vegas."
Life with Rebecca Weinberg, a go-go dancer turned stylist with whom Ms. Field shared a loft in the late '80s, better chimed with her tastes. "We developed a nice groove," Ms. Field writes of Ms. Weinberg. When, after a decade, that partnership dissolved, Ms. Field did not embark on another. She attracted younger women "who saw me as their fairy godmother." But, she writes, "I was a human being, not the answer to all their prayers."
"I can tell, you know, when people have a motive," she said.
Living on her own leaves Ms. Field free to indulge stray whims or, when the mood takes her, to sit idly on her terrace watching boats pass on the river.
"Sometimes I feel a little lonely, I'm not going to deny it," she said. "But I think I'm better off having nobody to answer to."

Sneakers and Songs Are Among His Specialties: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Footwear News Achievement Awards, sometimes called the Oscars of shoes, shines a spotlight on the industry's top designers. But when the singer Dua Lipa won for a Puma collection last November, her frequent collaborator Billy Walsh bolted at the sight of flashing cameras.
"Billy Walsh's five-seconds limit on the red carpet," Ms. Lipa said, as photographers shouted her name at Cipriani Wall Street.
"More like two seconds," Mr. Walsh, 40, added safely from the sidelines.
Avoiding attention is a peculiar trait for a man who collaborates with some of the biggest names in pop, including Ms. Lipa, Post Malone and the Weeknd, straddling the upper echelons of fashion and music.
He has collaborated with Rihanna on a Fenty collection with Puma, and consulted Kanye West on video directors. As a fashion stylist, he dressed the Weeknd in Givenchy for the Met gala and James Blake in Yohji Yamamoto for awards shows.
But his biggest achievements are in songwriting. His co-writing credits include "Sunflower" by Post Malone and Swae Lee, and six tracks on Mr. West's "Donda" album -- and those are just counting his Grammy nominations.
"Billy is part of a small group of people in this industry that I consider to be like family," Mr. Malone said by email. Their shared writing catalog also includes the hits "I Fall Apart," "Better Now," "Wow" and "Circles." "Not only is he one of the best songwriters, but he is a brilliant creative and fashion designer."
On a recent Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Walsh went shopping at Dover Street Market, the retail temple in Manhattan where he often goes for inspiration. "I would come here to do massive pulls for the Weeknd," he said. "I used to start on the top floor and work my way down."
He still does. As he flipped through racks of Raf Simons and Junya Watanabe on the seventh floor, Mr. Walsh recounted this unorthodox rise in the recording and street wear industries. "Fashion and music are definitely interrelated, but I guess I don't know too many people who have succeeded in both," he said. "I stay in the back and don't need credit."
Dressed in an all-black "uniform" (T-shirt, Prada nylon shorts, Alyx socks and Nike Air Tuned Max sneakers), with his signature shaved head and platinum veneers, he has the tough-guy appearance of a post-apocalyptic British rude boy.
Mr. Walsh credits his dexterity to his rough-and-tumble upbringing in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston. His father, William Walsh, a folk musician who performed at local Irish pubs, encouraged him to write poetry and dance. He was also an obsessive sneaker head. "I drove my mom crazy looking all over the city for the Adidas Equipment Basketball shoes with the interchangeable, different-colored socks," he said.
Other addictions followed. He started drinking at 11, often getting into after-school brawls until he sobered up a decade later.
At 18, he headed to Los Angeles to study dance at Loyola Marymount University, and signed with an agent. But dance gigs were few and far between, so he spent most of his 20s as a nightclub promoter, working alongside his brother at Hollywood hot spots like Emerson Theater and Hyde, where he would party with a young Post Malone and future designers like Matthew M. Williams of Givenchy.
In 2011, the choreographer Fatima Robinson, who he met at Eden, a Hollywood nightclub, encouraged him to stop dancing and focus on poetry and design instead. "This woman literally saved my life," he said.
He quit auditioning and busied himself with writing poetry and daydreaming about street wear. He looked inside his sneaker closet and began experimenting with Frankenstein combinations. One of the first designs cobbled together was a white Nike Air Force One with a black rubber creeper sole. "I always wondered what a creeper would look like with certain old sneakers from my childhood," he said.
He wore his custom sneakers to the clubs, which would get noticed by emerging V.I.P.s like Virgil Abloh and Travis Scott. In 2014, with seed money from fellow party promoters, he and a friend started a street wear label called Mr. Completely, which reimagined classic sneakers including Adidas Sambas and Stan Smiths.
To promote the brand, he held a party at Fourtwofour on Fairfax and invited everyone he knew. Among them was the stylist Jahleel Weaver, who ordered several pairs for his client Rihanna. That turned out to be a propitious sale. A few months later, Rihanna invited Mr. Walsh to design her debut collection with Puma (which went on to win the Footwear News "Shoe of the Year" two years later).
Sneakers opened other doors. One of them led to Illangelo, a veteran Canadian producer, who became a confidant and his unexpected entree into music writing. Once again, it started at a nightclub. The two were clubbing on the Sunset Strip in 2014 when Illangelo mentioned that he was disappointed by the state of songwriting. Seizing the moment, Mr. Walsh shared a short poem from his iPhone Notes app.
Illangelo was so impressed that he brought Mr. Walsh into studio sessions with Alicia Keys and he ended up getting his first mainstream writing credit on the song, "In Common." Illangelo also introduced Mr. Walsh to the Weeknd, who at first was only interested in working with him as a stylist. (The two shared an appreciation for military bomber jackets.) But as Mr. Walsh's reputation as a songwriter began to rise, the Weeknd began bringing him into the studio.
Those sessions resulted in three tracks from the 2016 album‌‌ "Starboy," including "True Colors" and "Die ‌for You," which peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 this month, seven years after it was first released, thanks to going viral on TikTok.
Mr. Walsh has since gone on to write more than 100 songs for artists as varied as the Kid Laroi ("Without You"), pop powerhouses like Mr. Malone and Ms. Lipa, and rock royalty like Ozzy Osbourne ("Ordinary Man"). His publishing catalog has racked up a combined 20 billion streams. Last November, "Sunflower" went 17 times platinum, becoming the highest-certified single of all time.
His soaring music career hasn't stopped him from other creative pursuits. In 2016, he started Donavan's Yard, a nightlife collective in Los Angeles with the D.J.s Drew Byrd and Sean G that hosts parties in Tokyo and a streaming concert series on Amazon Music Live. Branded merch is sold at Dover Street Market,
In October, he started a conceptual street wear label called Iswas with Keith Richardson, his creative partner at Mr. Completely. The label currently sells one item: a pair of painter's pants made from Japanese selvage denim that costs $ 450.
Wearing many hats, Mr. Walsh said, affords him creative freedom. "If Abel knows I am winning an award with Dua and doing my own clothing line, he respects that I'm doing OK for myself," he said, referring to the Weeknd by his given name. "No one feels like you're too dependent."
Back at Dover Street, Mr. Walsh went from floor to floor, examining the clothing racks like an archaeologist at a fresh dig. On the shoe floor, he picked up a pair of cloven-toed "tabi" boots by Martin Margiela. "I appreciate what this guy does," he said of the designer, who, like himself, shuns the limelight in favor of letting his work speak for itself.
After about two hours, he reached the Rose Bakery on the ground floor, took a seat and ordered an Earl Grey tea. As ambient music played overhead, he reflected on his unusual journey. "My success comes from artists recognizing that I see the creative process as sacred, somewhat secret," he said. "I am never the main focus, just as it should be."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Last year, the Bronx rapper emerged from the drill scene with a pop-friendly sound, and attracted the attention of Drake. Now she's releasing her first EP.
On a cold, damp afternoon earlier this month, Ice Spice didn't want to be recognized, so she covered her signature bounty of red curls with a wig of long blonde tresses, and wrapped that wig in a pink scarf. After a quick stop at her dentist in Bushwick to get her veneers adjusted, the rising hip-hop star hopped in a black SUV to head up to the area around Fordham Road in the Bronx where she grew up.
At first, she was muted on the ride, pulling a makeup case out of a pink Von Dutch bag and applying foundation, mascara and lip liner while playing a string of sentimental songs by the Atlanta R&B singer Mariah the Scientist from her phone through the car's stereo.
But by the time the SUV crossed over into the Bronx, Ice Spice -- wearing a black Prada fleece, black Balenciaga tights and black Uggs, her long nails painted in an exaggerated French manicure -- had livened up, playing her latest single, "In Ha Mood," on repeat, and rapping along with quiet force:
"Oh, they mad 'cause I keep making bops/Oh, she mad 'cause I'm taking her spot/If I was bitches, I'd hate me a lot."
These are the sort of coolly but directly confident verses that have made Ice Spice, 23, one of the most signature voices in New York drill music, as well as an emerging pop culture touchstone, beloved both for what she says and how she comes off while saying it.
"I'm just naturally super chill and nonchalant about a lot of things," she said. "I've always been that way, since I was a baby."
On Friday, she'll release her first EP, "Like..?," which gathers her previous singles with some new songs, all of which feel of a piece. While the sound of the Bronx drill scene she emerged from is often unrelenting and harsh, the style of her EP, she said, is "pop drill" -- spacious, up-tempo and a little skittish, with careful use of melody and just the right amount of punch.
Unlike many New York drill rappers, who tend toward the antic, Ice Spice raps with equanimity: calm, controlled and almost reticent, letting each line linger ever so slightly, almost as if to draw you to her before she again pushes you away.
"She makes this thing we call sexy drill," said Nicole Racine, founder of Talk of the Town, a media company that documents New York drill music. "Her being sexy, being feminine, not the rah-rah drill that we expect."
Just a few months ago, Ice Spice didn't need to hide behind decoy wigs, but that changed during one hectic week in August. First, Drake expressed admiration for her music -- she posted a screenshot of his message -- and then flew her along with her manager and producer, RIOTUSA (who goes by Riot), on a private jet to his annual festival in Toronto, OVO Fest.
"I probably had like $ 200 to my name on that trip," Riot said, chiming in from the back seat of the SUV. "It kind of felt like the flight was like me flying into a new life."
Ice Spice said she was "mad broke" at the time, laughing as she remembered the "fake-ass purse" she was carrying.
A few days after the event, she released "Munch (Feelin' U)," the song that would become her true breakout, inaugurate a delicious new piece of slang and establish her signature visual identity: golden curls, bold outfits, intense eye contact.
"We slept on that record because that was the only song we had that didn't have a sample," said Riot, whose father is DJ Enuff, an influential New York radio figure. At the time, the dominant sound of New York drill relied on familiar samples; earlier, they'd released "No Clarity," based heavily on Zedd's decade-old trance-pop hit "Clarity."
But the originality of "Munch" turned out to be a blessing -- a hit reliant upon an older hit can feel contingent, saying less about the new artist than about the durability of the older one. "I'm happy the first song that ever really blew up for me like that was an original song, with an original word," Ice Spice said. "I'm just so proud of that."
The response, fueled by social media, was instant. "I remember the week 'Munch' came out, I had went to the mall, right?" Ice Spice said, characteristically unperturbed. "And a bunch of kids started running up to me like, 'Yo, are you the "Munch" girl?' And like, taking pictures of me and recording me."
Before stopping at New Capitol diner for an M&M cookie, she popped by St. James Park, where the "Munch" video was filmed, hoping to use the bathroom -- it was locked -- and quipped, "They should name it Munch Park."
In the wake of the success of "Munch," Ice Spice signed to 10K Projects/Capitol Records, and had her first taste of financial success -- "I got 2 milli for using a mic," she posted online at one point. But riding down the blocks where she grew up, making the trip back for the first time since handing out Thanksgiving turkeys alongside fellow Bronx rapper Lil Tjay, she expressed a little exhaustion. "People won't ask you directly, like, 'Hey, can you buy me a house?' I mean, they will actually," she said. But she was even more frustrated about the things she couldn't yet do: "It's just weird now being at a certain place and not being able to just help everybody that you want to help."
Born Isis Gaston to a Black father and a Dominican mother who divorced when she was still a toddler, Ice Spice has five younger half siblings. She'd written poetry and raps since childhood, and her father routinely encouraged her to freestyle with him. ("We would be walking to school and he would be trying to get me to rap about my day," she recalled.) She didn't begin writing full songs until 2019, inspired by the breakout wave of Brooklyn drill rappers that included Sheff G and Pop Smoke, and didn't record any of them until 2021, after a video of her doing the #BussItChallenge gained traction and she had a brief flirtation with extreme virality.
"Once that happened I was like, Oh, if I could do it one time, I'm pretty sure I could do it again," she said. "That's when I knew I could be an artist." Sensing an opportunity, she rushed to complete her first song: the squelchy, tough-talking, Brooklyn drill-esque "Bully Freestyle." She began recording more tracks, and documenting the process, eventually releasing promo trailers for each to gin up attention and enthusiasm.
All of her released songs so far have been produced by Riot (born Ephrem Lopez Jr.). The two met when they were both studying communications at SUNY Purchase, where Ice Spice also played volleyball, as she did at the Catholic high school she attended in the Bronx.
They found a common language in drill songs that didn't shy away from the personal, and that were lyrically emphatic, line by line. "I like to hear catchy stuff and I always be thinking like, Damn, what should I caption this? So I just started coming up with mad captions," she said. She also found that writing personal stories came naturally. "There's like this type of therapy to it," she said. "It's just like a relief whenever I complete a song."
Before "Munch," attention came in fits and starts, not all of it positive. "I was getting a lot of hate when I first put out my anything -- content, music, whatever," she said, but added, like a sophisticated child of the internet, "hate could take you a long way."
Even now, she's still something of a lightning rod. Because social media spins tizzys from even the barest scraps of information, there was prurient interest after Drake unfollowed her on Instagram after the Toronto trip. "We're cool," she said. "We spoke after that a couple times and we're good. There's no beef." When she was being roasted for her lackluster performance at Rolling Loud in September, her first festival appearance, she "was just happy they were talking about me, really."
But she has benefited greatly from the online attention, too. Her fandom is still settling on a name: Spice Cabinet? Spice Rack? Spice Cadets? Munchkins? And she has seamlessly been absorbed into the meme universe -- split portraits of her alongside Tupac, XXXTentacion, Martin Luther King Jr. and Princess Diana float around the internet, and her lyrics ("How can I lose if I'm already chose?") pop up in tweets and captions. She decided to record "Princess Diana," from her new EP, after seeing memes flying around the internet late last year calling her this generation's Princess Diana.
"Who don't wanna be a princess?" she said quietly, as if acknowledging something that she'd already known for a while, and assumed everyone else did, too.
In perhaps the ultimate indication of pop culture absorption, Lil Nas X, the effortless channeler of virality, dressed as her in the "Munch" video for Halloween, sporting a neon tank top and a wild wig.
"The hair is definitely iconic," she conceded. "When I was in high school, I was straightening my hair, trying to be something that I'm not. Now it's flattering seeing a wave of Afros. I enjoy that. I feel like that's great for Black women especially, making Afros more like just a normal staple look, you know?"
Racine, of Talk of the Town, said, "She'll make the sexy drill mainstream, she's just gonna open more doors." But drill, the aesthetic that has delivered Ice Spice's first dose of fame, may only be a convenient way station.
"She's a pop star," Riot said. "People say drill just to box people in."
Ice Spice agreed that her aspirations stretch beyond that sound. "For me personally, I think I have passed that," she said. "I do want to be a mainstream artist. I want diamond records and plaques and Grammys. So I think in order to get that, you do have to surpass just one subgenre."
Back in the car, she scrolled through new music, both from the EP, and a verse she recorded for a remix of PinkPantheress's "Boy's a Liar," which has a similar tempo to her own songs but a completely different texture. It's her first adventure out into the world beyond drill but unlikely to be her last.
"I've tried Detroit beats. I've tried trap. I've tried hyperpop," she said. She speaks Spanish, and has been chatting with the Dominican rapper Tokischa about possibly working together.
On her way home from the Bronx, she stopped at a mall in Elizabeth, N.J., so she and Riot could buy True Religion jeans for an upcoming video shoot, which would take its visual cues from the early 2010s, perhaps the last era, pre-drill, in which New York rap truly spurred national conversation. On the way, they dove into a conversation about whether New York, the birthplace of hip-hop, could ever truly fall off.
"I just feel like there's never been a moment where it was dead," she said. "You can name a year and I can say an artist from New York that was popping, lit, that year. We was singing them songs in the parties."
For maybe the first time all day, she betrayed just the slightest bit of agitation: "Like, I would be mad if one day somebody refers to 2022 as when New York fell off when it's like, 'Hello, I'm here."'

Amid Dusty Trays, Offices Rethink the Cafeteria: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The corporate cafeteria can be an especially lonely place these days.
"You used to walk in at 12 o'clock on a Tuesday and stand in line to get something," said Casey Allen, 46, who works for a division of the agricultural chemical company BASF in Raleigh, N.C. "Now, you walk in and you're usually first in line."
A paternalistic fixture of white-collar life born of the Industrial Revolution, the office dining room survived the midcentury move to sprawling suburban office parks. It weathered the rise and fall of cubicle culture and power lunches, and more recently, the lavish excess of the Silicon Valley office lunch.
But as the American office emerges from its pandemic slumber, can the cafeteria survive layoffs, a workweek that sometimes requires only a few days in the mother ship and a new, more demanding generation of employees?
Even at companies like Meta, which this month announced that it would lay off 126 cafeteria employees at its headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., workers are skipping free meals in a quest to leave the office as soon as possible.
"The world of the traditional big cafeteria is dead," said Fedele Bauccio, who in 1987 co-founded Bon Appétit Management Company, which runs food service at hundreds of museums, universities and companies like LinkedIn. "They are just too expensive to maintain, and not flexible enough."
Still, office workers need to eat. So companies are blowing up the cafeteria. Long regarded as a way to encourage productivity, cafeterias are being reframed as respite and recreation, designed to attract younger workers in a job market badly in need of them.
Some companies are installing cocktail bars, or hosting sunset oyster-shucking parties to help employees relax and socialize after work. The large dining halls at tech giants are being divided into smaller, more homey spaces flexible enough to feed a work force whose size changes drastically day to day. Developers are building restaurants that function like subsidized corporate cafeterias but are open to the public.
"Free pizza isn't enough anymore," said Andrew Montesano, the North America food programming and operations manager at LinkedIn.
Employees, especially younger ones, are demanding more culturally authentic meals and climate-friendly kitchen protocols, like reducing waste, according to Mr. Bauccio and others in the corporate food service business. They are eating less meat and questioning labor practices. Health and wellness have become a menu mantra.
Companies that aren't paying attention are likely to suffer, said Jennifer A. Chatman, associate dean for academic affairs at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.
Smart leaders know that informal interaction can keep corporate culture from eroding as remote work persists, and may be the main purpose for coming to the office in the future, she said.
"A cafeteria is not the only way to get there," Dr. Chatman said, "but people need to eat, and we know eating together fosters interaction."
Food has become such an important recruitment and retention tool that some applicants for remote jobs are even offered credits with food delivery companies, or generous weekly lunch stipends -- benefits that may be especially prized as inflation drives up food costs.
Free meals can also offer psychological rewards, Dr. Chatman said. "There's an advantage to being able to say, 'My company buys me lunch every day.' There is a symbolic value in feeling like you are being taken care of by the company."
On the shores of South San Francisco, an airy two-story restaurant called the Anecdote opened in March on a biotech campus. It functions like a corporate cafe, but has the look and feel of a restaurant.
Bon Appétit Management Company pioneered the idea with real estate developers. Companies in the building can use the restaurant as a way to offer employee meals, sometimes free or at a discount. But anyone can stop in for dishes like crispy tofu sliders and $ 16 Dungeness crab cakes.
Company downsizing and hybrid work hours prompted the idea, but cities -- particularly on the West Coast -- that are pushing companies to stop providing abundant free food helped it along, said Alison Harper, a Bon Appétit district manager. Huge corporate cafeterias, the reasoning goes, keep workers from patronizing local food businesses, and offer nothing for the neighborhood.
"The pandemic speeded up what I consider a paradigm shift that was already happening in the Bay Area and beyond," she said. "Cities were saying we don't want big, closed cafeterias that don't benefit the community anymore."
Hans-Peter Goertz, 48, eats at the Anecdote during the three days each week he goes to the Cytokinetics office. He misses the variety and speed of food service at his former employer, Genentech, where a dosa or an order of fresh, local fish was delivered fast and free. A meal at the Anecdote, he said, is more akin to a longer, European-style lunch.
"I can get a really nice meal for $ 4 or $ 5 in a beautiful setting with an innovative menu," Mr. Goertz said. "It's a very nice perk that translates beyond the economics."
There may be no better example of the changing fortunes of corporate dining than the former Condé Nast cafeteria in Midtown Manhattan, once an exclusive palace of power where the editor Anna Wintour ordered blood-rare burgers, and one might spot Cameron Diaz at the salad bar or John Updike having lunch with a New Yorker editor. The cafeteria line became so legendary that it had a role in the film "The Devil Wears Prada." ("You do know that cellulite is one of the main ingredients in corn chowder," Stanley Tucci tells a young new hire ladling some into a bowl.)
The Durst Organization opened the revamped cafeteria at 151 West 42nd Street in 2018, after Condé Nast moved out. Part of its $ 150 million renovation was spent giving the cafeteria, originally designed by the famed architect Frank Gehry, a face lift. Anyone whose company rents space in the building is welcome.
Durst put beehives on the roof of a neighboring building and uses its honey in the cafeteria. It began offering master classes in cooking lobster and fresh pasta. Food scraps are shipped to the company's 1,800-acre McEnroe Organic Farm near Millerton, N.Y., and the compost is used to grow vegetables for the cafeteria line.
Quality food, served in refined gathering spots, has been such a winning formula that Durst is replicating it in its building at 825 Third Avenue, which is also undergoing a $ 150 million renovation. By this summer, employees at companies like Gotham Asset Management and National Bank of Egypt will be able enjoy a cafeteria lunch, and after work head to a 6,000-square-foot terrace for happy hour or an oyster-shucking party.
At One World Trade Center, which Durst co-owns with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, a large, casual communal space on one floor offers a quick-service cafe with high-end coffee and beverages. The building is home to young, midsize tech companies like Wunderkind and Undertone, which have pumped up their own pantries, sometimes making them the centerpiece of the office.
"What we're seeing is a merger of the renaissance in food and corporate dining," said Spencer Cohn, who manages food and beverage for Durst. "The shift is not temporary."
David Neil, a Durst principal, said a number of companies have made their leasing decisions based on a building's food and beverage offerings.
In less flashy corners of corporate America, companies are struggling to find efficient ways to manage unpredictable lunch crowds and reduce labor costs while still offering dining options. Streamlined menus with QR codes are posted on office walls, and orders are made on apps or at kiosks.
Some businesses have abandoned cafeterias altogether in favor of subsidizing food delivery. An app called Relish by ezCater aggregates a variety of restaurant orders from employees and delivers them all at the same time, in uniform packaging, so everyone can eat together. It uses a network of more than 104,000 restaurants in every state, selected based on their ability to reliably feed large groups.
Stefania Mallett, the chief executive of ezCater, said that companies she never thought would subsidize food for employees have signed up because it's cheaper than running a cafeteria and satisfies younger workers, for whom food is becoming a requirement rather than a perk.
The New York ticket company SeatGeek uses the service regularly, she said. On days it offers subsidized lunch through the Relish app, five times as many employees come to the office.
"It's much cheaper to give you a sandwich than replace a worker," she said.
Still, there are some parts of the country where the old-school corporate dining room endures. The cafeteria at Hallmark headquarters in Kansas City, Mo., is one of them.
J.C. Hall, who founded the greeting-card company, created one of the country's first corporate cafeterias in 1923 because there was nowhere nearby to eat besides an expensive restaurant. (He is also credited with starting the coffee break.)
In 1956, Mr. Hall opened the Crown Room, with an army of cooks, a terrific view and 36 chandeliers shaped like the company logo. "Greeting cards represent thoughtfulness, and it's fitting that those who create them should be working in the best conditions we could provide," he said at the time.
The Crown Room was always the heart of the company, with cakes for employee birthdays, World Series parties and gift-wrapping demonstrations. People heading home for the day could pick up a potpie or some meatloaf for the family on their way out the door.
During the height of the pandemic, when headquarters was closed, the kitchen still turned out packaged sandwiches and salads to feed people in the manufacturing plants. The dining room reopened in April. "Hallmarkers were thrilled to have the Crown Room back open," said Paul Herdtner, a company spokesman who is particularly fond of the cafeteria's Texas sheet cake.
It's a piece of Hallmark corporate culture no one wants to change, but reality is reality. These days, the cafeteria line is open only three days a week.

On Milan's Streets, It's Pink All Over: [Editorial]

Full text: MILAN -- Spotting people in bright colors is always a thrill. Outside the latest round of men's shows, which started on Friday and wrapped up earlier this week, dressing vibrantly seemed to be the law of the land.
Bold floral prints and embroidered flowers covered jackets, shirts and trousers. Pink, a color I'd see occasionally in years past, was seemingly inescapable, brightening up lots of outfits as well as the occasional head of hair. There was also green hair, a look that Jeremy Sochan of the San Antonio Spurs debuted last month -- about 30 years after Dennis Rodman did it while he was playing for the Spurs. Mr. Rodman, as it happens, was also a fan of gender fluid dressing, which in recent years has only become more ubiquitous on the street. I hope this trend continues.

MILAN -- It is nearly 72 years since Giovanni Battista Giorgini, a descendant of an old Florentine family, telephoned a group of American buyers attending the spring haute couture shows in Paris and invited them to attend a fashion show in his home.
Five accepted. They were the Seventh Avenue designer Hannah Troy and the buyers for B. Altman and Bergdorf Goodman of New York, I. Magnin of San Francisco and Morgan's of Montreal. So successful was Giorgini's experiment that the shows were soon moved to the Pitti Palace, attendance grew by exponents and the cornerstone of a postwar Italian fashion industry was laid.
It is doubtful Giorgini could have imagined that seven decades later, Italian fashion shows would attract thousands of guests, an equivalent number of press and mobs clamoring for glimpses of fashion show attendees like the members of the K-pop boy band Enhypen.
As much as any trend or runway spectacle (or personnel guessing game; we see you, Gucci), it is the continuity of Giorgini's vision that struck an observer this week and how durable and robust Italy's claim on fashion primacy remains.
A case in point was the Fendi show on Saturday. Held at the company's headquarters, on a set that featured a suspended Rube Goldberg contraption, Silvia Venturini Fendi's men's wear presentation could have served as a mission statement for why Italian design still matters. It is not wildly overstating things to say that the designer took on some of the more harassing cultural anxieties -- principally about gender and safety -- and cloaked them in garments that, while they revealed the male body in an unorthodox manner (one-shouldered sweaters, for instance), simultaneously enveloped it in shapes that were swaddling, protective and unabashedly luxurious.
There were sleek gray woolen greatcoats that swept to the ground. There were fringed capes that called to mind a Fendi rendition of the ancient Venetian tabarro cloak. There were, of course, the various bags and intricately treated hide garments associated with a label established in Rome in 1925 as a leather goods shop. More deep rooted, though, were allusions to a discreetly assured manner, a kind of grandpacore typical of the Milanese bourgeoisie and that has attracted the attention of street-style photographers like Scott Schuman of The Sartorialist.
You won't often see the two labels mentioned in the same sentence, yet if Fendi represents one face of Italianness, Dsquared is in some ways the flip side of the same coin. The twin designers Dean and Dan Caten are natives of Toronto. Yet, having lived and worked in Milan for decades, they are honorarily local and, as such, have adopted an almost stereotypically Italian style of sartorial mash-up -- exuberant, silly, rife with references and devoid of specific context.
The Caten twins talk so much about individuality that it is easy to forget how much their designs celebrate the collective teenage id. More determinedly than most, they have spent their careers rummaging around in a psychic closet where goth, emo, gamer geek and fanboy identities are jumbled in a heap.
Take the show's second look, for which the tattooed TikTok superstar JeanCarlo León, a.k.a. Jashlem, was sent strutting down the catwalk in a pink T-shirt emblazoned with a knife-wielding pussycat and the legend "Cute & Nasty," and some super-distressed jeans worn unbuttoned over a second sewn-in pair of trousers and belted with an outsize rodeo buckle. What followed was a spin-cycle of fringed Western wear, shredded denim, exposed boxers, leather jockstraps, supersize trapper hats and T-shirts that provocatively recast the world-famous soft-drink logo as Choke.
While the show was coed, it was amply supplied with lacy underthings shown primarily on cisgender men. "There's nothing hotter than a guy in girlie panties," Dan Caten remarked beforehand. And, given that a raft of maverick labels like Menagerie, Candyman Fashion and Ciciful have joined mainstream brands like Cosabella, Fleur du Mal and Savage X Fenty in cranking out frilly undergarments for those with male genitals, he may have a point.
Placeholder collections can be like emails from Human Resources: You know they contain crucial information and yet nobody reads them. Hence the first Gucci show since the unexpected November departure of Alessandro Michele, the stealth firebrand who reinvented a sagging brand and drove sales into the billions by riding a wave of gender dispersion, was deleted from consciousness almost as quickly as seen.
Like it or not, fashion needs headliners. It is not yet enough to fill the vacuum left by a star designer's departure by cramming front rows with cross-platform celebrities like Idris Elba, Nick and Susie Cave, Kai, Jalen Ramsey and the elite gamer Pow3r, hiring live bands like Marc Ribot's Ceramic Dog to perform and then presenting a studio team's crowdsourced efforts.
To be sure, there were elements of the Gucci collection to approve, if not exactly admire or covet. (Admittedly, a supersize flasher raincoat was pretty cool.) And, yes, in the show's first looks it seemed as though the brand had decided to emphasize foolproof elements of a tailoring heritage by rendering trousers and jackets and coats voluminously and pairing them with skinny shirts reminiscent of 1970s Florence.
Ultimately, and as a "reflection of the individualities represented by the multifaceted creatives and craftsman who inhabit the house of Gucci," according to the notes, the show was a semi-coherent blur of ankle boots, scarf-patched denims, sailor beanies and other products likely to reduce the interval between full-price retail and markdown at Woodbury Common.
And certain things were downright puzzling. To wit, some goofy pirate boots that forced the models to walk with an oddly mincing gait and a floor-length skirt of industrial gray wool that came with a deep slit up the front and no zipper. It is one thing to toy with gender tropes and quite another to ignore anatomy. "It's not nice to fool Mother Nature," to quote a famous '70s advertisement for Chiffon margarine.
"All my life, I've asked myself why fashion is considered so cheap and so trivial in many situations." Miuccia Prada said to Vogue Business before a show that, as so often in the career of this designer, aimed at upgrading the status of fashion in the cultural hierarchy from that of perennial stepchild.
The title of the show was "Let's Talk About Clothes," and the two designers -- Mrs. Prada and Raf Simons -- used a strict visual grammar to assemble groupings based on traditional masculine garments reduced to stark geometric shapes. Perhaps the designs were uncomfortably reminiscent of work Italo Zucchelli did at Calvin Klein before being replaced at the label by Mr. Simons. Also, where Mr. Zucchelli celebrated sexuality, the Prada models were so underdeveloped they looked as if puberty had yet to kick in.
Yet if both the casting and a collection of largely monochrome circular, tubular, conical and squarely boxy stuff (jackets, suits and coats, some single-breasted, some two-buttoned, some three-buttoned; and also parkas, MA-1 bombers and mid-calf duffle coats snug enough to be hobbling) made scant allowance for physical ease, that was doubtless part of the point. Even the suede work aprons refashioned as tunics called to mind manual laborers in an August Sander portrait. Sander's subjects (like, evidently, Mrs. Prada and also, perhaps, Mr. Simons) understood innately that, in the long sweep of history, personal comfort is a fairly novel idea.
History is seldom far from the thoughts of Giorgio Armani, who as he approaches 90, increasingly casts his thoughts backward to the Italy of his youth. "We tend to forget about so many beautiful things that have been done," Mr. Armani said Monday before the V.I.P. presentation whose guests included Ed Westwick, James Norton and the "White Lotus" hunk Theo James.
Seated on a stage created inside the palazzo where he lives in center city, Mr. Armani tented his hands and gestured toward a set suggestive of the marmoreal elegance characteristic of entrance halls constructed throughout the city from the 1920s to the 1970s.
Increasingly, in recent years, Armani shows revisit a style of dress that is rich, quiet and evocative of a metropolis as staid as it is elegant. Not for the Milanese or Mr. Armani the exuberance of southern Italy. Here, women of a certain age and class still hold to a singsong Italian adage that translates as "a low heel, a dab of makeup and a string of pearls."
It is not an Instagram-friendly way of dressing, and so the shows can sometimes feel like looking at old Kodachrome slides -- all those eight-button jackets, nubby tweeds, woolen shawls and belted overcoats. (It hardly helps that his models move at the speed of molasses.) Despite that, there is a distinct pleasure to be experienced by relaxing into the pace of a designer who, above all, stands for continuity -- the "OG of OGs," as one wag remarked.
It is a bit like having a tisane at a traditional confectionery shop like Marchesi, founded in 1824, with a relative whose sense of style, correctness and propriety are firmly rooted in the past. Keep your trashy TikTok and your visually noisome Instagram feed, Mr. Armani often seems to be saying. Take a walk around this ancient city and value what came before.
"With beauty you can touch something eternal," he said.

Full text: Celebrity, tabloid fodder, would-be rock star, nepo baby -- who went on to have her own movie star, nepo baby (Riley Keough) -- Lisa Marie Presley packed so much of our collective cultural id into her tiny frame over her 54 years that it was hard to know who she was beneath it all. She had the sleepy eyes of her father, Elvis, and the delicate bone structure of her mother, Priscilla, and was famous from the moment she was born: part of the story of the damage and joy the spotlight can wreak and how it can trickle down over generations. She struggled to define her own identity even as she embraced her birthright (and various equally headline-grabbing men, including Michael Jackson and Nicolas Cage), landing on the cover of Vogue in 1996 with a story entitled "Daddy's Girl." Inside, Steven Meisel captured her trying on different selves, literally, to see how they might fit -- including one shot of her grinning in a khaki Prada camp shirt and tie, cropped black hair in a rockabilly bouffant, channeling her father during his army days when he was still a fresh-faced twentysomething riding the crest of his talent. In the end, she was heir not just to his looks and estate, but the myth too.

Full text: William Wildman and Parker Kennedy began dating as students at the University of Mississippi before going their separate ways for four years.
When William Edwin Wildman III first saw Parker Calin Kennedy in March 2015 at the pool in the condominium complex where they both lived in Oxford, Miss., Mr. Kennedy was drinking a bottle of Veuve Clicquot Champagne with friends.
It was around 9 a.m. and the last day of spring break at the University of Mississippi, where Mr. Wildman was a junior and Mr. Kennedy a sophomore. "My friends and I were scoffing, 'What is he doing? It's ridiculous,"' Mr. Wildman said. "But I was intrigued. He had this sense of occasion. I had to find out who he was."
As it turned out, Mr. Kennedy was known for toting around bottles of champagne: He worked as an events manager for Debutante Farmer, a catering and events company founded by Elizabeth Heiskell, the "Today" show food contributor, and would often receive freebies at the end of a job.
Though the two never talked at the pool, Mr. Wildman later sent a direct message to Mr. Kennedy on Instagram. They began chatting and a couple of days later, on a rainy afternoon, Mr. Wildman came over to Mr. Kennedy's apartment to watch films.
"He had a raincoat on with a little hood," Mr. Kennedy said. "When he pulled it back, I thought, 'I really like this guy."'
Neither could remember the movie that they watched that day, but agreed that it was Disney and must have been a title from a short list. "Parker watches the same movies over and over again," Mr. Wildman said. "He stopped watching new movies in 2010."
"If I'm having a bad day ..." Mr. Kennedy began.
"I open the door and I hear 'The Devil Wears Prada,"' Mr. Wildman finished.
Though Mr. Wildman said he is more of a "documentary person," he added that he will watch Disney for Mr. Kennedy.
"I don't watch scary movies and he loves gore and horror," Mr. Kennedy said. "I'm like, 'OK you made me suffer through that movie night, so now we're going to watch a Disney movie to replenish my positive good vibes."'
About a week after meeting, the two had their first official date at Newk's Eatery, a sandwich shop in Oxford. "It was my first time going out for a meal with a guy in Oxford," Mr. Kennedy said. "The glory of college is that you can do what you want to do without having someone tell you that you can't do it."
They bonded over their upbringing in large families from small Southern towns. Mr. Kennedy, now 28, was born and raised in Kerrville, Texas, outside San Antonio, and is one of six half- and stepsiblings.
Mr. Wildman, 27, is from Laurel, Miss., where his extended family lives, and is the oldest of three. "Growing up, I wanted to get out of that town so bad," Mr. Wildman said. "But now, I have a new appreciation for it. It's taught me a lot of interpersonal skills that I don't think I could have gotten elsewhere."
The pair dated for a couple of months, enough time for them to develop strong feelings.
"I loved William from the moment I met him," Mr. Kennedy said. One night that spring, he told Mr. Wildman that he wanted to marry him.
"I was obviously enamored," Mr. Wildman said. "But I knew what the next few years held for me. He was ready to move quickly and I was much more hesitant, only because I knew I was moving abroad, then going to grad school. The plan I had at the time didn't include a relationship."
In May 2015, Mr. Wildman left for Bass Lake, Calif., where he worked as a counselor at Skylake Yosemite Camp for the entire summer. "I didn't have a cell signal," he said. The lack of communication frustrated Mr. Kennedy and the relationship cooled off. Both began dating other people.
Back on campus during the fall of 2015, Мr. Wildman thought about Mr. Kennedy often. In December 2015, before he left to study and intern at UNICEF in Paris for eight months, he texted Mr. Kennedy, asking him to come over.
"'I think this is a bad idea,"' Mr. Kennedy said. But he went anyway, curious about what Mr. Wildman might say.
In his living room, Mr. Wildman bent on one knee and made a promise: "If the universe brings us back together again, I won't fight it, but right now, I have to go."
"It was hard," Mr. Kennedy said. His feelings, he said, were "10 percent hope, 90 percent hatred."
They stayed apart but in touch for some time. In May 2017, Mr. Wildman graduated from the University of Mississippi with a bachelor's degree in international studies and French, then moved to Denver. The following year, Mr. Kennedy received a bachelor's degree from the University of Mississippi in hospitality management.
In Denver, Mr. Wildman worked as a community engagement specialist at Apple for about a year. Afterward, in August 2018, he returned to the University of Mississippi to earn a master's degree in higher education administration, just as Mr. Kennedy left Oxford for New Orleans to be closer to his family.
Nearly a year later, Mr. Wildman joined Tulane School of Architecture in New Orleans as an assistant director of graduate admission. For the first time in about two years, he and Mr. Kennedy met in person, for drinks. They discovered that the spark between them was as strong as it had ever been. In July 2019, they decided to take a risk and move in together in a two-bedroom loft in New Orleans.
"I was nervous and scared," Mr. Kennedy said. After all the ups and downs, and the separations and reunions, he said, "I thought this could be the breaking point."
Cole Putman, a close friend of the couple, didn't believe Mr. Wildman when he texted to say that he and Mr. Kennedy were moving in together. At the time, he did not even know they were dating again. But when he visited Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Wildman a few months later, in February 2020, he thought their decision made sense. "They had started building this cute life and this routine," he said. "I started falling in love with their relationship."
Friends were one thing; family was another. Mr. Kennedy said when he told his mother, Lisa Ballay, about their plan to move in together, she was "shocked" by the pace. But she accepted the move. "My mom is one of my closest friends," Mr. Kennedy said. "She was one of the first people I told I was gay."
Mr. Wildman was more hesitant in sharing his decision to live with Mr. Kennedy with his parents. "My parents didn't know we were together," he said. For months, he did not tell them that his roommate was also his boyfriend.
"I come from a very conservative, very religious background and they had a harder time accepting me," he said. "It had always been a touchy subject." When he finally told his mother and father that he and Mr. Kennedy were romantically involved in early 2020, his parents struggled to accept that his interest in men was not a passing phase.

But after some time, he said, they understood that his relationship with Mr. Kennedy was "forever," and "took it seriously and became more accepting. Now I have a much better relationship with my parents."
Half a year after Mr. Wildman and Mr. Kennedy moved in together, the pandemic began. "Then we really got to know each other," Mr. Wildman said.
In the following months, Mr. Kennedy decided to open an interior design business. He started Piqué by Parker Kennedy in November 2020.
Mr. Wildman pivoted away from higher education and enrolled at Loyola University New Orleans College of Law. He plans to graduate in May 2023 with a law degree and a master of laws in health law and administration, and to join the New Orleans office of the Baker Donelson law firm as an associate.
As they made these major life changes, Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Wildman found strength and relief in each other. "With my world being so rigid, it's nice to have someone who's in a creative world who can balance me out and bring me to earth," Mr. Wildman said.
"They support one another in building up what they want their lives to be while also having their separate ventures," Mr. Putman said. "Neither of them has lost their personhood. It's like if you're mixing a cocktail, and the flavors don't dilute each other, but bring out the others."
Mr. Wildman proposed to Mr. Kennedy on Christmas Day 2020 on a bench in Audubon Park in New Orleans, where they often ate lunch during the pandemic. "I said something like, 'I made you a promise a long time ago, and now I'm following through on it,"' Mr. Wildman said.
Six months later, on vacation in Tulum, Mexico, Mr. Kennedy surprised Mr. Wildman with his own proposal. "We're a gay couple, so we can make up our own rules," he said.
They were legally married Dec. 15 by Judge Janis van Meerveld in a small ceremony at the United States District Courthouse for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Mr. Kennedy's mother, Ms. Ballay, and his stepfather, Charles Ballay, attended, along with Mr. Wildman's father, William Edwin Wildman Jr., and his mother, Amy Gavin Wildman.
A few weeks later, at the Château le Chereau in Montrieux-en-Sologne, France, Mr. Wildman and Mr. Kennedy celebrated their union with 75 guests over several days of events that culminated in a black-tie New Year's Eve bash. Mr. Putman led the wedding ceremony.
As New Orleans residents, Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Wildman wanted live music at the wedding, so Tomos Xerri, a harpist, played during the welcome party on Dec. 29 and Ensemble Obbligato, a string quartet, performed for the Dec. 31 ceremony and the cocktail hour that followed. Roasting chestnuts on an open fire enhanced the sense of wintry festivity, and bartenders serving cocktails out of a bright yellow 1968 Renault Estafette van added a playful element.
"It rained and poured almost all of last week in Sologne," Mr. Wildman said. "The one day of the week it was sunny and peaceful and 10 degrees warmer was our wedding day. If that's not a symbol for what we can conquer as a couple, I don't know what is."

The Light Arts Along with musicians, performers included a fireworks artist and a fire breather. "We wanted the wedding to feel like everyone is going to a big New Year's Eve party," Mr. Wildman said.

In 'M3gan,' a Deadly Doll Deserves a Killer Wardrobe: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The titular star of the horror film "M3gan," released last week, had to try on several outfits before finding a signature look.
A doll's clothes can be as memorable as any worn by a human, especially if that doll has a taste for blood.
Talky Tina, the demonic toy made famous by "The Twilight Zone," had her plaid dress with a dainty lace-trimmed collar. Annabelle, the sinister doll that first appeared in "The Conjuring," has her white gown with leg-of-mutton sleeves. And even those who have not seen "Child's Play" (or its sequels) probably know of Chucky and his blue overalls.
The titular star of the horror film "M3gan" stands to be another murderous doll recognized for a killer outfit. Not least because M3gan, whose name is pronounced like Megan, for most of the film wears a striped, silk twill scarf tied in a pussy bow -- a sartorial choice that tends to elicit strong reactions.
M3gan, which stands for Model 3 Generative Android, is a life-size artificially intelligent doll designed to provide companionship and emotional support -- until a programming glitch turns her into a Terminator-esque killing machine. There are parts of the film where the doll is played by a high-tech puppet, but in most scenes, M3gan is played by the actress Amie Donald, 12, wearing a mask.
M3gan, who has wide eyes with long dark lashes and dirty blond hair that falls below her shoulders, wears the pussy-bow scarf with an inverted-pleat shift dress layered over a striped long-sleeve shirt, white stockings and shiny black Mary Janes. Gerard Johnstone, the director of "M3gan," described the doll as having clothes that evoke the mod fashion of the 1960s and "long, flowing hair" like the "Mod Squad" actress Peggy Lipton.
"I wanted her to be classy and elegant and unexpected, almost like the toy equivalent of those automotive shows from the '60s, where the car would appear on the turntable and everyone's minds would be blown," Mr. Johnstone said.
The film's original script, written by Akela Cooper, only referenced M3gan wearing children's clothes, Mr. Johnstone said. Putting her in a loose-hanging shift dress was both a stylistic and practical decision.
"M3gan has to move quickly and unencumbered. She's got to run on all fours. She's going to attack people," he said. "With the shift dress, I could see the possibilities."
About 25 versions of the dress were produced by the film's costume and wardrobe department. "They lasted through all of the dancing, all of the killing," said Daniel Cruden, the film's costume designer. Lizzy Gardiner, an Oscar-winning costume designer who created M3gan's main outfit with Mr. Johnstone, said the pussy-bow scarf was also painstakingly reproduced.
"We needed so many perfect replicas that each one had to be cut and hand sewn with the stripe in the silk in exactly the same place," she wrote in an email. "It needed to be fluid without being bouncy. Large but consistent with a young, tiny girl. Doll-like but fashion forward."
While developing M3gan's wardrobe, many other possible outfits ended up on the dressing room floor. "Initially I wanted her to have a bunch," Mr. Johnstone said. But by giving her a signature look, "that one costume can be really the focus," he added. "People could dress up as her for Halloween."
Where did you look for inspiration for M3gan's clothes?
GERARD JOHNSTONE I was on Pinterest every night looking at fashion, trying to figure it out. Originally it was just me and my wife, for a female perspective. I kept going back to the '60s because of the detailing and the fabrics. Everything was so rich. And Gucci kids' dresses ended up being a big inspiration. I loved a yellow one with red ribbons that I saw online, but we couldn't physically get our hands on it.
If Gucci was such an inspiration why isn't M3gan wearing the label?
JOHNSTONE I wondered if we could get them on board. But you have to get approval and it takes a long time, especially when you're making a horror movie, so we went our own way. We hadn't proved ourselves. The hope now is that it wouldn't be too hard to get some designers if we do another film.
DANIEL CRUDEN If a toy from a film gets licensed and there isn't clothing approval, it could be seen as replicating for a profit. Even if I'd found a pair of vintage Gucci sunglasses, we'd have put them through clearance to make sure they were OK to use.
When viewers see M3gan commit her first murder, she wears a different outfit -- a black cloak with gold buttons and a fur collar, black stockings and leather gloves. What inspired that look?
JOHNSTONE It was kind of a subversion of Little Red Riding Hood. I also thought of her as a bit like Damien from "The Omen." The black gloves were a practical consideration because the gloves made the hands feel more robotic. And she's a doll -- she has to have some accessories.
Speaking of accessories, in another scene M3gan wears a pair of purple sunglasses. Why?
JOHNSTONE I really fought for her to have that moment. It felt like it could either be great or ridiculous. I was worried some people might think, "Is this going to diminish the scares?" But once everyone saw her really rocking the look, they started to get on board.
CRUDEN We had a real hunt for the sunglasses because we knew they were going to be a statement.
JOHNSTONE I wanted Prada.
CRUDEN We ended up with a brand called Minista, they came from a children's boutique in Auckland, New Zealand.
What are some of the outfits that didn't make it into the movie?
CRUDEN There was a scene that showed different M3gans on a turntable wearing looks I created for her. One was French-inspired, with a black beret, black turtleneck and high-waisted flared silk pants. We had a beach M3gan with a peasant blouse, beach hat and espadrilles. Equestrian M3gan had jodhpurs and riding boots. Sporty M3gan looked like she was ready for tennis.
JOHNSTONE Daniel did a very Audrey Hepburn look with a scarf and sunglasses. But the looks were on a dummy M3gan, and she didn't look alive. If we'd been able to do it with our main M3gan, it would have worked. It was a shame.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: André Leon Talley amassed piles of Louis Vuitton, Versace, Chanel and Fendi. Now it's all about to go up for auction to benefit Black churches.
André Leon Talley, the barrier-breaking Black fashion editor, was famous for his love of extravagant things and extravagant gestures. For striding through the world in a fabulous designer caftan and towering fur hat, a set of monogrammed Louis Vuitton trunks at his side as he unfurled his pronouncements: on beauty, designers, the meaning of life.
So after he died in January 2022 with no heirs, the speculation began: What would happen to the collections he had amassed over the decades and squirreled away in his homes in White Plains, N.Y., and Durham, N.C., an Aladdin's cave of artifacts that represented a certain style of luxury in the second half of the 20th and early 21st centuries?
Would they be left to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where Mr. Talley had begun his career assisting Diana Vreeland in the Costume Institute, and where he often presided over Vogue's Met Gala red carpet livestream? Would they go to the Savannah College of Art and Design, where Mr. Talley had curated Oscar de la Renta and "Little Black Dress" exhibitions? Would they be used to establish a scholarship in his name at Brown University, where he received his master's degree?
"André was very, very specific," said Alexis E. Thomas, the executor of his estate. "He left a very clear will."
And that was: Sell. Sell it (almost) all. The proceeds to be split between the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem and the Mt. Sinai Missionary Baptist Church in Durham, where he grew up. Communities that represented his private life, where he had been an active (and activist) member for decades, and where he marched for change alongside.
"Basically what André did was monetize his fashion assets to secure the financial sustainability of two very important Black institutions of faith," said Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation and a friend of Mr. Talley's since 1995.
Exactly what that means will be on view this week as Christie's unveils "The Collection of André Leon Talley," a 448-lot auction that will begin a three-city tour on Jan. 18 in Palm Beach, Fla., just after Martin Luther King Day. The tour will continue on to Paris (during couture) and New York (during fashion week) and culminate in a live auction of 68 lots on Feb. 15, during Black History month (the rest of the sale will open online starting Jan. 27). The timing is not coincidental.
It is to underscore the final grand gesture of an editor who was often name-checked as an inspiration by Black designers, models and editors, but who was also accused of not doing enough to force fashion's gatekeepers to face their own complicity in the industry's racism; of pandering to their bias and blindness in order to keep his most favored status and trading his intellect and knowledge for the allure of a Charvet shirt, or a Chanel tennis racket.
"André, like most of us, just wanted to be loved," Mr. Walker said. "And one of the reasons he really loved his church family is he was embraced unconditionally, and that wasn't the case in the fashion world, which sought to put him in a box of the caricature of the fashion diva." Even if it was a caricature he helped create and maintain.
"Internally he was constantly negotiating that reality," Mr. Walker said. "He had a consciousness that was informed by the history of racism and his own experience of racism both growing up and in the industry. He was a very private person and a master of compartmentalization, largely as a reaction to that. He didn't reveal himself to many beyond the news release. But on the bookshelves of his White Plains house were scholarly books on 17th-century French court dress next to first edition copies of Paul Robeson's biography and Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s history of Black America."
Both sides of Mr. Talley's life will be on view in the sale, which is, in some ways, an effort to create a bridge between the two. It will allow people to see, Ms. Thomas said, "the worlds that André did not expose." Whoopi Goldberg has written an essay for the catalog; the designer LaQuan Smith will be speaking at the Palm Beach event; and in New York the Abyssinian Baptist choir will perform.
Christie's has put a current low estimate on the sale of $ 702,200. Historically, however, personal estate auctions often far exceed the estimates because of the unquantifiable emotional dimensions involved. At the recent Joan Didion sale at Stair Galleries, for example, a pair of Céline sunglasses valued at a few hundred dollars sold for $ 27,000. At Christie's own sale of the Joan Rivers estate, a silver dog bowl engraved with her pet Spike's name estimated at $ 500- $ 800 ended up selling for more than $ 13,750. During the auction of the estate of Ronald and Nancy Reagan, a pillow valued at $ 1000 to $ 1,500 went for $ 71,250. Last year Christie's held a sale for DJ Kool Herc that ultimately brought in 226 percent more than the estimate.
"You know, we have no clue what will capture people's imagination, what will get people to bid against one another," said Elizabeth Siegel, the head of private and iconic collections at Christie's. "Will it be one of Mr. Talley's amazing caftans, or will it be a portrait of him?"
It could be one of the handful of Warhol-signed screen prints (Mr. Talley worked for Mr. Warhol at Interview after his time at the Met) or one of the many photographs by Horst P. Horst and Cecil Beaton and Louise Dahl-Wolfe. Or it could be a gold brocade caftan by Dapper Dan or one of six Prada crocodile coats. It could be a pile of colorful Versace scarves or a quilted Chanel bag; a diamond Dior watch or gold Verdura cuff links. Or a pair of Baccarat candlesticks or the African wood stools and reclining chairs that mixed it up with the gilded marble-top Louis XV console once owned by Mrs. Charles W. Engelhard, Annette de la Renta's mother. Simply sorting through the contents of Mr. Talley's two homes, Ms. Siegel said, took "a team of specialists."
"Once you went up the stairs in White Plains, you got to go into a back bedroom where there were just racks and racks of clothing," Ms. Siegel continued. "There were books stacked everywhere." Ms. Thomas talked about hundreds of pairs of shoes, sunglasses and gloves, of sketches from Karl Lagerfeld and Manolo Blahnik. (The auction comprises the majority of Mr. Talley's possessions, though a certain percentage did go to SCAD.)
Some of the lots are in better condition than others -- the Hermès drinking glasses that Mr. Talley never really used because he never entertained, for instance, and the Hermès bicycle he never rode but kept in storage at the Ritz in Paris -- but all of them share a provenance that straddles both fashion and Black history. (It is a combination that Christie's is also hoping will make the auction house relevant to a new audience.)
"I used to always say, 'André, why don't you just sell some of this stuff that you have -- you could be living like a king,"' Ms. Thomas said, a coded reference to the fact that Mr. Talley was famously bad with money, seeing it largely as a means of acquiring the things he loved rather than paying, say, a tax bill (a pattern that contributed to a dispute over the ownership of his White Plains house that was settled just after his death). "He was always saying, 'No, Alexis, that's my legacy."'
And so it will be, though perhaps not in the way anyone would have expected. Ultimately, Mr. Talley wanted his memory contained not in the objects he acquired but how he chose to dispose of them.
"That," Ms. Thomas said, "is what André wanted the world to know about who he was."

At the Golden Globes, a Night of Statement-Making: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The awards show returned, and so did major dressing up.
So the Golden Globes returned, two years after disappearing from our screens, first because of a pandemic-induced lockdown and then because of scandal -- financial, ethical and racial. And with their disappearance went the first major red carpet of that phenomenon otherwise known as the Extended Awards Season Fashion Show.
Before the event, speculation was rife: Would stars actually show up for the tarnished Hollywood Foreign Press Association? And if they did, would they seek to play down their connection with the evening's awards by dressing down? Would they stay away from eye-catching ensembles, in favor of the forgettably banal and the bland?
As if. Globes night turned out to be a night of statement-making, onstage and on the red carpet. Not so much of the marketing or branding kind, but rather of the personal kind. And it was the more interesting for it.
Jerrod Carmichael, the host, set the tone with an opening monologue that addressed the Globes' historical lack of diversity without pulling any punches and went on from there -- with a matching set of six (count 'em) outfit changes that included two skinny black velvet suits (the first by Armani); a symphony of pinks; one white tuxedo with a sheer turtleneck and pearl necklace; and a Bode beaded tunic. It may be a record for number of award show looks worn by a single host. If some fashion brand doesn't sign him up immediately, it'll be the biggest surprise of the night.
Still, go big or go home seemed to be the general theme. Rihanna, making her first major post-baby event appearance, swaddled herself in a black velvet Schiaparelli bustier dress and an enormous shoulder-swallowing sculpted velvet stole, plus velvet opera gloves and Cartier diamonds.
Angela Bassett played a silver superhero in Pamela Rolland sequins. Laverne Cox channeled Marilyn Monroe in a blond bob and vintage Galliano gown. And Jessica Chastain got caught in a gossamer beaded Oscar de la Renta spiderweb -- with a matching mask. She was one of the few attendees to nod to the continued reality of Covid.
Royalty was a trend, represented in a plethora of red (Lily James in a bandeau top from which was suspended acres of swagged Versace skirting and Billy Porter in a cardinal velvet Christian Siriano coatdress with a sweeping train) and purple (Selena Gomez in Valentino and Sheryl Lee Ralph in glimmering Aliétte). This was probably not surprising given the recently unavoidable nature of the subject thanks to Prince Harry's memoir.
Also pink, courtesy of Seth Rogen in salmon Dior Men and Margot Robbie in powder puff Chanel. (Rumors of her separation from the brand appear to be highly exaggerated.) And overblown rosettes on lapels, as represented by Eddie Redmayne's chocolate Valentino, Diego Calva's forest green Gucci and Emma D'Arcy's oversize Acne Studios satin tux, skirt and trousers, chosen because, they said, "nothing says nonbinary like wearing both a skirt and trousers."
There was a lot of speaking-in-clothes going on. Michaela Jaé Rodriguez, in draped sapphire Balmain, told E! that her dress was "giving water butterfly." Michelle Williams, in cascading tiers of Gucci ruffles, looked like sea coral, wafting in the waves. And Jenny Slate, in leaf green Rodarte with a bloom at the throat, said she wanted to look "like a woman who's about to turn into a magical plant." Why not? It's the beginning of the year. Anything could happen.
Donald Glover said he was going for comfort, and the chance to get "mildly drunk," with his white silk YSL pajama-and-robe set under his tux, possibly the perfect combination of working-from-home dressing meets black tie. You can go from the ballroom to the bedroom in one easy step.
Indeed, it was but one of a variety of contemporary twists on ye olde tux, as modeled most successfully by Jean Smart in an elegant, sharp-shouldered tuxedo dress with an actual twist at the waist, and Hannah Einbinder in a strapless black Carolina Herrera tea dress with a white bow at the bodice.
She looked as if she could move, as did Letitia Wright, in a simple Prada trompe l'oeil silk column dress, deliberately crumpled and splotched with a rough-cut slash at the leg that was an ode of sorts to the elegance of imperfection. Like the night itself, it was a reminder that when it comes to our flaws, it's how you deal with them that matters.
