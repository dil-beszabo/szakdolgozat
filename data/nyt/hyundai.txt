Full text: A tax benefit boosted quarterly earnings, but that masked a decline in earnings from carmaking caused by intensifying competition.
Tesla's profit from sales of electric cars slumped in the last three months of last year because of price cuts intended to thwart increasingly intense competition, the company said on Wednesday as it warned of a tough year ahead.
Profit in the fourth quarter nearly doubled to $ 7.9 billion, up from $ 3.7 billion a year earlier. But $ 5.9 billion of that profit came from a tax benefit. Without that one-time accounting effect, profit would have fallen.
Tesla has slashed prices for the two cars that make up the bulk of its sales -- the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y sport utility vehicle -- as automakers like BYD, in China, and General Motors, Hyundai, Ford Motor and Volkswagen, in the United States and Europe, have begun selling more electric vehicles.
The price cuts have helped Tesla sell more cars and forced other carmakers to respond, helping to make electric vehicles more affordable. But the cuts have weighed on Tesla's profit. In 2022, Tesla was one of the most profitable carmakers in the world, but its margins from vehicle sales have fallen by almost one-third in the last year and are now comparable to those of other large rivals.
Because of the price cuts, sales revenue from cars last quarter rose just 1 percent from a year earlier, to $ 21.6 billion -- even though Tesla sold 1.8 million cars in 2023, a 35 percent increase from 2022. Tesla made up some of the difference by reducing manufacturing costs.
Tesla shares slumped about 6 percent in after-hours trading after the company said it expected sales growth to be "notably slower" in 2024 as it developed a budget-priced vehicle. Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, said during a conference call Wednesday that the vehicle, whose design is still a secret, might be available by late 2025.
"That will be a challenge," he cautioned, because of new technology being developed to manufacture the car at a lower cost.
At Wednesday's close, Tesla stock was 17 percent below where it started the year and down more than 25 percent from its 12-month high in July.
The carmaker faces an array of challenges this year, including economic uncertainty in all of its major markets and questions about the future role of Mr. Musk. He surprised investors this month when he said on X, the social media site he owns, that he wanted the Tesla board to raise his stake in the company to 25 percent, from 13 percent, effectively giving him shares worth more than $ 80 billion.
If he doesn't get his wish, Mr. Musk said, he will develop new artificial intelligence products "outside of Tesla." Tesla's board has not responded publicly.
Mr. Musk said Wednesday that he needed 25 percent to protect him from being ousted "by some sort of random shareholder advisory firm." He added, "There's a lot of activists that basically infiltrate those organizations and have, you know, strange ideas about what should be done."
Mr. Musk did not clarify how Tesla's board could grant him a stake worth $ 80 billion without diluting the value of Tesla shares.
The automaker commands more than half the electric vehicle market in the United States, and it has more models than any other manufacturer that qualify for $ 7,500 tax credits under rules that took effect Jan. 1. Plummeting prices for lithium, cobalt and other materials essential to battery production should help lower manufacturing costs.
Tesla has begun selling the Cybertruck, a pickup that is the company's first new model since the Model Y in 2020. But Tesla remains dependent on the Model 3 and Model Y for sales. BYD and Volkswagen, along with its Audi, Porsche and Skoda brands, offer larger selections of vehicles.
Tesla said Wednesday that the cost of ramping up production of the Cybertruck had weighed on profit, and that it would take longer than usual to produce the vehicle in large volumes because of a complex manufacturing process. The truck's body is made of stainless steel, which resists rust and is more durable than the steel used in most cars, but is also harder to shape and weld.
Slowing sales growth for electric vehicles is another challenge. Surveys show that many people are interested in electric vehicles but hesitant to buy because of high prices and concern about finding enough places to charge the cars.
In a setback, Hertz said this month that it would sell some of its fleet of Teslas because they were less profitable than expected, and because some customers struggled with the unfamiliar technology.
Election-year politics add another element of uncertainty for all electric vehicle makers. Former President Donald J. Trump, the front-runner for the Republican nomination, has called electric vehicles a hoax, and his supporters have vowed to roll back Biden administration policies intended to promote the cars and encourage domestic manufacturing.
Senator John Barrasso, a Republican from Wyoming who has endorsed Mr. Trump, recently portrayed electric vehicles as a subsidy for rich liberals at the expense of "hardworking families in my home state."

Full text: Automakers like Ford, Kia and Toyota are offering more hybrid options to appeal to buyers who aren't ready for fully electric vehicles.
As Teslas and other electric vehicles dazzled car buyers with futuristic technology and dreams of a gasoline-free future, hybrid cars began to seem like yesterday's news. Sales of the Toyota Prius, the standard-bearer for hybrids, fell 85 percent over a decade.
Now, a slowdown in the growth of electric car sales has led General Motors, Ford Motor and Volkswagen to walk back ambitious targets for those vehicles. And sales of hybrids are robust, underscoring what may be the enduring reality check of 2023: Many Americans are hugely receptive to electrification, but they're not ready for a fully electric car.
"Consumers want the same experience they've had" with a combustion engine car, said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights for Cox Automotive. "And we are not there yet. Price is still the top barrier for most consumers."
Americans bought a record 1.2 million electric vehicles last year, a gain of about 46 percent and a 7.6 percent share of all new car sales, according to Cox. But hybrid sales rose even faster, up 65 percent to more than 1.2 million, lifting their market share to 8 percent from 5.5 percent, according to Edmunds. Throw in plug-in hybrids, and nearly one in 10 new cars pairs a gasoline engine with electric motors to save fuel and boost performance.
Analysts say stubbornly high electric car prices and worries about public charging are pushing some car shoppers to hybrids, including renters or urbanites who can't charge a battery-powered car at home. Hybrids deliver savings at the pump with no need to plug in for hours or plan trips around charging stops. Their batteries are much smaller and cost a lot less than the batteries in fully electric vehicles.
Buyers paid about $ 42,500 on average for hybrids in November, according to Edmunds, compared with $ 60,500 for electric vehicles and $ 47,500 for a conventional models. There is a smorgasbord of affordable hybrid models, many starting around $ 30,000 -- including a stylishly redesigned Prius that returns a model-record 57 miles per gallon. The electric vehicle market, by contrast, remains top-heavy with luxury offerings.
Jim Farley, Ford's chief executive, said mainstream consumers were fundamentally different from early adopters who flocked to electric vehicles with little encouragement or education from automakers.
"E.V.s continue to grow with spectacular numbers, but what's changing is that people buying them are not willing to pay a premium," Mr. Farley said in an interview. "Now we have to get costs under control and even -- surprise, surprise -- advertise."
Ford is trimming its planned production of the F-150 Lightning pickup truck and increasing output of the more-affordable F-150 Hybrid by 20 percent. The automaker plans to quadruple overall hybrid production in hopes of selling 100,000 this year. They include the red-hot Maverick compact pickup, whose 37-m.p.g. hybrid version has exceeded Ford's most optimistic sales forecasts.
So why doesn't Ford make all Mavericks hybrids? Mr. Farley said the company remained committed to offering a full range of powertrains, including electrified trucks that can double as mobile generators to power equipment, homes or even the electrical grid. Securing battery supplies also takes a long time, Mr. Farley said, sometimes longer than building a new assembly line.
"We didn't know a $ 30,000 truck would be this popular," he said of the Maverick. "Ford has struggled to make money on small cars since the beginning of time."
The hybrid resurgence is mainly benefiting Toyota, Honda and Hyundai Motor, including its Kia sister brand.
Those automakers account for roughly 90 percent of U.S. hybrid sales, followed by Ford. All continue to invest in the technology even as G.M., Volkswagen and other automakers vow to pivot entirely to electric vehicles.
Honda outdid itself in 2023, nearly tripling hybrid sales to 294,000 units. Hybrid versions of the Honda Accord sedan and the CR-V sport utility vehicle now account for more than half those models' sales. That Accord combines luxury-level comfort, quality and amenities with up to 44 m.p.g. in overall driving, for $ 33,290 to start.
En route to record U.S. sales in 2023, Hyundai, Kia and their Genesis luxury brand together sold more electric vehicles in the United States than any automaker save Tesla. Yet Hyundai Motor remains bullish on hybrids, even after the Biden administration proposed regulations that would require two-thirds of new cars to be fully electric by 2032.
"Anyone who wants to survive in this business is making these electric investments," said Steve Center, chief operating officer at Kia America. That includes Hyundai, which has committed to investing $ 12 billion in factories in Alabama and Georgia.
But Mr. Center added that an electric vehicle might not serve the needs of a "cowboy in Montana with a pickup truck." Hybrids can help reduce emissions from those kinds of vehicles faster, he said.
Mr. Center offered a bold prediction: As combustion engine cars fade into obsolescence, all remaining gasoline models will adopt electrification in hybrid form. Gasoline cars won't be able to compete without it, as consumers and regulators alike demand better fuel economy and reduced emissions.
"Everything should be hybrid to start with, because everyone can drive a hybrid, everywhere," he said.
Toyota, the world's largest automaker, seems to be treading that path. Within a few months, Toyota will offer nine hybrid-only models, including one from its Lexus luxury brand. The company sold more than 640,000 hybrids in America last year, 29 percent of its total U.S. sales; it sold about 15,000 fully electric vehicles.
David Christ, general manager of Toyota's North American division, said the automaker expects to crack 40 percent electrified sales in 2024. He echoed Mr. Center's view on the prospects for combustion engine cars.
"Over time, we're not opposed to going all-hybrid to make a faster step to a greener future," Mr. Christ said.
Toyota's faith in democratizing hybrid technology turned the company, once an environmental darling, into a whipping boy as it was widely accused of foot-dragging over electric vehicles. If Toyota is feeling vindicated, Mr. Christ won't admit it.
"A year ago, we were getting roasted in the media for not being an E.V. believer," he said. "We thought that was unfair, that we weren't in on electrification. We started it. We have eight million hybrids on the road today, and every one reduces greenhouse gas emissions."
But Mr. Christ added that the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles was not yet ready for many millions of battery-powered cars, which is why sales of such vehicles have slowed.
"At the end of the day, the consumer drives this industry, not the manufacturer," he said.
Toyota will plant its biggest flag yet in June. The redesigned 2025 Camry will be offered only as a hybrid. That may seem to be a major gamble for the nation's perennially best-selling sedan. Toyota sold about 290,000 Camrys last year, and just 35,000 were hybrids. If the new Camry can maintain its sales, Toyota will convert a few hundred thousand buyers to a roughly 50-m.p.g. hybrid in one swoop. If not, the Camry franchise will take a huge hit.
Yet Toyota isn't taking a shot in the dark. When Toyota switched the Sienna to an all-hybrid lineup for the 2021 model year, it immediately became America's best-selling minivan, up from fourth place.
But some auto experts said hybrids could do only so much.
Dave Cooke, senior vehicles analyst for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said hybrids were a critical, affordable tool that allowed millions of drivers to use less gasoline but remained a transition technology. Long-term climate change goals still demand a shift to electric vehicles powered by a renewable energy grid, he said.
"In our comments to the E.P.A. and industry, it's 'Hey, put a hybrid on everything,"' Mr. Cooke said, referring to the Environmental Protection Agency. "But we still need stricter standards to ensure automakers face rules on what's technologically achievable."
Mr. Cooke noted that the fuel economy of the nation's fleet had held flat for years, in part because of the shift to pickups and S.U.V.s. Recent gains are entirely attributable to the rise of electric vehicles, with hybrids playing a negligible role.
Chris Harto, transportation and energy policy analyst for Consumer Reports, agreed with that assessment. "Hybrids buy some time, but E.V.s are where we need to go" to achieve climate goals, he said.
Yet Mr. Harto bemoans the popular narrative that pits hybrids and electric vehicles against each other.
"They're both taking market share from less efficient I.C.E. vehicles," Mr. Harto said, referring to internal combustion engines. "And there's a lot of market share to take."

Full text: Donald Erwin, a 59-year-old disabled veteran, disappeared in 2013 after leaving his home in the Ozarks. Last month, a YouTube diver found his car submerged at a nearby property.
One morning in late December 2013, Donald L. Erwin, a 59-year-old disabled veteran, told his wife he was going to buy cigarettes.
He often woke before dawn and was a heavy smoker. She went back to sleep. Sometime after 6 a.m., Mr. Erwin got into his silver Hyundai and left his mobile home in the central Ozarks.
He never returned.
For nearly a decade, Mr. Erwin's family, together with some friends and locals, have scoured the hilly region near his home in Camdenton, Mo., for clues. "I did not stop for nine years," Mr. Erwin's sister, Yvonne Erwin-Bowen, said in an interview, noting that she would travel from her home in Kansas City at least twice a year to search. Mr. Erwin's wife has since died.
By last year, Ms. Erwin-Bowen, 62, had begun to lose steam. "I didn't go look for my brother one time," she said. "I literally put it in God's hands."
Then, last month, Ms. Erwin-Bowen received a call from a friend: A scuba diver had found her brother's car about five miles from his home, submerged in a pond. The car, a 2002 Elantra, was retrieved on Dec. 16 from a private property in southern Camden County, according to a news release from the local authorities. Several days later, detectives and cadaver dogs recovered human remains and an artificial hip that matched Mr. Erwin's, the authorities said.
The diver, James Hinkle, said in an interview that he became aware of the case about two years ago and began methodically searching bodies of water near Mr. Erwin's home in a kayak mounted with sonar equipment, as well as with a drone.
On the afternoon of Dec. 14, Mr. Hinkle, whose volunteer scuba search-and-recovery team runs a YouTube channel, decided to search a pond on a private property, when he noticed a tire floating in the water. "That kind of got my nerves a' jumping," he said. Using a drone, Mr. Hinkle then observed a light, square-shaped object in the water. As he began to move the drone closer, he added, "it looked more and more like a car."
Two days later, Mr. Hinkle returned to the property with his kayak, a submergible camera and a magnet tied to a rope, which he dropped onto the car as a guide. Sheriff's deputies and detectives, together with divers from the local fire department, were able to reach the car and match its license plate to Mr. Erwin's. A local towing company then helped haul the vehicle from the pond.
The grim discovery has brought a confusing mix of closure, elation and renewed agony to the people who spent years searching for Mr. Erwin. "It is a new heartbreak," Ms. Erwin-Bowen, his sister, said. "Even though I knew in my heart he was gone -- accepting the reality is a whole different thing."
Mr. Erwin, who was also known as "Donnie," served in the Navy during the Vietnam War and later moved to Georgia, she said. But a rare condition led to his losing a leg. Ultimately, Mr. Erwin lost his job as a programmer at Mitsubishi, she said.
Eventually, Mr. Erwin and his wife moved to a mobile home in the Ozarks. Shortly before Mr. Erwin's death, he learned he would likely need to have his second leg amputated, Ms. Erwin-Bowen said. "My brother did what he did because he didn't want to be a burden on anybody," she added, noting that she believed he had taken his own life.
"People always say when you find that loved one, you get the closure," she added. "No you don't, because you'll never understand."
More than 24,000 people remain missing across the United States, according to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System. Other cold cases have been solved by amateurs before the authorities. In 2021, a YouTuber found a car belonging to two Tennessee teenagers who had been missing for 21 years; another search-and-recovery dive group claims it has helped solve 29 such cases.
Ms. Erwin-Bowen said that she hoped that her family's story would encourage others in similar situations not to lose hope. "Never stop looking, the answer is out there," she said. "Never give up."

U.S. Auto Sales Expected To Slow After Strong 2023: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Automakers sold more cars in 2023 than a year ago as supply chain chaos ended, but sales are now under pressure from higher interest rates.
After enjoying a strong rebound in sales in 2023, the auto industry appears headed for slower growth this year as consumers struggle with elevated interest rates and high prices for new cars and light trucks.
Edmunds, a market researcher, expects the industry to sell 15.7 million vehicles this year. That would amount to a modest increase from the 15.5 million sold last year, when sales jumped 12 percent.
"There's definitely pent-up demand out there, because people have been holding off purchases for a while," said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds. "But given the credit situation, we don't think the industry will see a ton of growth this year."
Since the coronavirus pandemic, automakers have struggled with shortages of critical parts that have prevented them from producing as many vehicles as consumers wanted to buy. In 2023, the shortages, especially for computer chips, finally eased, allowing production to return to more normal levels.
But over the past year, the Federal Reserve has significantly raised interest rates, which has pushed up costs considerably for car buyers.
For years, many people took advantage of zero-percent loans to buy vehicles, even as prices climbed. But such deals, offered by automakers to move inventory, have nearly disappeared in the wake of the Fed's rate hikes. In the fourth quarter of 2023, new-vehicle sales with zero-percent financing accounted for just 2.3 percent of all sales, according to Edmunds.
Monthly payments are at near-record highs. In the fourth quarter, the average monthly payment on new cars was $ 739, up from $ 717 in the same period a year ago.
Several automakers were hoping that a rapid rise in sales of new electric vehicles would drive the industry to gains into 2024 and 2025, but those cars and trucks haven't taken off quite as quickly as many analysts and executives had hoped.
In 2023, sales of battery-powered models in the United States topped one million vehicles for the first time, and Cox Automotive, another research firm, expects sales to reach 1.5 million this year. But General Motors, Ford Motor, Volkswagen and other manufacturers had been expecting an even faster ramp-up.
But consumers have balked at the high prices of many of the newest electric models. Many drivers are also reluctant to make the switch to battery power, because they are not sure they will be able to find enough places to quickly refuel. That has forced automakers to reset their plans.
G.M. had once forecast it would produce 400,000 electric vehicles by the middle of 2024 but now has given up that target, and it has delayed the production of some electric models.
Ford had been aiming to have enough factory capacity by the end of 2024 to make 600,000 battery-powered vehicles a year, but it recently lowered production plans for its electric F-150 Lightning and its electric sport-utility vehicle, the Mustang Mach-E.
On Wednesday, G.M. said that its sales of new vehicles in the United States jumped 14 percent last year. The company sold 2.6 million cars and light trucks in 2023, up from 2.3 million in 2022, when the chip shortage limited production.
G.M. sold about 76,000 electric vehicles, up from 39,000 in 2022. But most were Chevrolet Bolts, a model that the company recently stopped making. Only about 13,000 were vehicle based on newer battery technology that G.M. had been hoping would make its electric vehicles affordable to many more car buyers.
Sales for G.M. in the fourth quarter were relatively weak. They climbed just 0.3 percent from the same period a year earlier and were down 7 percent compared with the third quarter of 2023. The company said the sales of several important models were limited by a strike at some of its plants by the United Automobile Workers union.
Separately, Toyota Motor, the second largest seller of cars in the United States after G.M., said its 2023 sales rose 7 percent, to 2.2 million vehicles. The company's sales in the fourth quarter were 15.4 percent higher than in the same quarter a year ago and about 5 percent higher than in the third quarter.
Stellantis, the maker of Chrysler, Ram and Jeep vehicles, said that it sold 1.5 million cars and trucks in 2023, about 1 percent less than the year before. The company plans to introduce eight new electric vehicles this year, and it aims to have battery-powered models account for half of its North American sales by the end of the decade.
Honda, Hyundai and Kia also on Wednesday reported strong U.S. sales for 2023 And on Tuesday, Tesla, which dominates the electric car business in the United States, said it sold 1.8 million cars worldwide last year, up 38 percent from 2022.
Ford is expected to report its sales total on Thursday.

Tesla Sales Swing Back After Prices Are Slashed: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The leading U.S. electric-vehicle maker also drew buyers eager to take advantage of government incentives that will be harder to get in 2024.
Tesla sales jumped during the last three months of 2023 after the carmaker slashed prices and customers rushed to take advantage of tax breaks on electric vehicles -- provisions that will be harder to come by in 2024.
The company said on Tuesday that it sold 484,500 cars in the fourth quarter, up from 435,000 in the third quarter and 405,000 in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year, Tesla sold 1.8 million vehicles. The gains put Tesla on track to sell more than two million cars in 2024, potentially overtaking established carmakers like Mercedes-Benz and Renault.
The rebound in sales during the fourth quarter should help calm investor concerns about whether Tesla can defend its dominance of the market for electric vehicles as it faces increased competition from traditional carmakers.
During the last year, Tesla has lost market share to rivals like General Motors, Hyundai, Ford Motor and Volkswagen as they introduced more electric vehicles. Tesla accounts for half the electric cars sold in the United States. In 2022, Tesla accounted for two-thirds of the market.
Another electric vehicle maker, Rivian, said on Tuesday that it sold nearly 14,000 vehicles in the last three months of the year. That number was up substantially from a year earlier but down about 10 percent from the third quarter.
In China, the largest market for electric cars, Tesla faces intense competition from BYD and other Chinese automakers. BYD sold 526,000 fully electric cars worldwide in the fourth quarter, exceeding Tesla, a milestone that many auto analysts had been expecting given the Chinese company's rapid growth.
Chinese automakers have moved faster in offering a wide range of affordable electric models as the market has expanded beyond the affluent early adopters of technology. They are the core customers who have bought Teslas for as long as the company has been around.
"The customers who are buying E.V.s now are second adopters, who have fundamentally different needs," said Shay Natarajan, a partner at Mobility Impact Partners, a private equity fund focused on investing in sustainable transportation. "They care about tangible and immediately realizable decreases in total cost of ownership, and they care about convenience."
In Europe, Volkswagen and its Audi and Skoda divisions sell more electric vehicles than Tesla, although the Tesla Model Y is by far the best-selling model on the continent, according to data compiled by Schmidt Automotive Research.
In the United States, people interested in buying an electric car had a strong incentive to take delivery before the end of the year because of new rules intended to cut China out of the supply chain.
Tesla had warned on its website that the two least expensive versions of its Model 3 sedan would no longer qualify for $ 7,500 federal tax credits after Dec. 31. The cars have batteries made in China. Germany and some other European countries have also rolled back subsidies for electric vehicle buyers.
To maintain sales, Tesla cut prices, offering Model 3s on its website for well under $ 30,000 after factoring in the tax credits. By late December, the number of lower-priced cars listed on the website appeared to have dwindled, suggesting that the strategy had succeeded. But the price reductions cut into Tesla profits, which fell 44 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier.
Tesla said it would announce earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023 on Jan. 24.
While fewer Teslas will qualify for federal tax credits in 2024, the company is in a better position than most of its competitors. The Performance version of the Model 3, which includes upgraded wheels and brakes, will remain eligible for the subsidy, as will all versions of the Model Y sport utility vehicle, according to a federal government website. Tesla makes batteries for those cars at a Nevada plant operated with Panasonic, allowing it to meet domestic manufacturing requirements.
That gives Tesla a significant advantage over competitors like Ford, which has said that its Mustang Mach-E sport utility vehicle will not qualify for the credit in the new year.
Ford and others rely on manufacturers in China for crucial components. Ford is building battery factories in the United States, but they will not begin producing until 2025.
General Motors has been building batteries at a new factory in Ohio, but has struggled to get the plant operating at full capacity. Initially only the Chevrolet Bolt will qualify for tax credits, G.M. said in December. The Cadillac Lyriq and electric Chevrolet Blazer will no longer be eligible.
G.M. has said it is adjusting its supply chain so that those and other vehicles, including electric versions of the Chevrolet Silverado pickup and Equinox sport utility vehicle, will become eligible early in the year.
Tesla and other carmakers may also benefit from lower interest rates in the new year. Investors are betting that the Federal Reserve and other central banks will start to ratchet down rates as inflation cools.

China's Auto Giant BYD Sells More Electric Cars And Hybrids Than Ever: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sales by BYD, the country's dominant automaker, topped 3 million last year, including 1.6 million fully battery-powered cars. It's a sign of China's rapid growth in EVs.
The Chinese corporate giant BYD said Monday that it sold three million battery-powered cars in 2023, its most ever, capping a turbulent year for China's electric vehicle industry.
Even as sales surged, heavy competition and a sustained price war took a financial toll on many automakers.
But BYD last year sold 1.6 million fully electric vehicles and another 1.4 million hybrids, which are powered by both batteries and gasoline. Together that is a 62 percent increase over 2022. BYD is also making money, tripling its profit to $ 1.5 billion in the first half of last year.
All told, Chinese automakers are expected to have sold about 9.4 million electric vehicles and hybrids last year, an increase from 6.9 million in 2022, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. The group said it expected sales in 2024 to rise again, to 11.5 million.
Already the world's largest automobile market, China is now also its fastest growing, racing ahead in the electric vehicle transition that is upending the global industry. China rules the supply chain for battery-powered cars -- from the mining and processing of cobalt and other minerals used in batteries, to the deployment of robots in factories that make cars and trucks. China's electric vehicle companies and their suppliers employ some 1.5 million people.
A big reason for China's early lead in electric vehicles was the government's heavy financial support for the industry's development. After financial incentives for consumers expired at the end of 2022, automakers slashed car prices to lure buyers. Many companies, including BYD, introduced another round of cuts this fall, intensifying the price war.
In November, BYD advertised discounts on five models of up to 18,000 renminbi ( $ 2,550). Another Chinese electric vehicle company, Ji Yue, a partnership of Geely and Baidu, slashed the price of all versions of its first model by RMB 30,000 ( $ 4,200) in November.
Last year's price cutting was started by Tesla, the American automaker that has a factory in Shanghai. In January 2023 it lowered prices in China for the second time in three months, and others followed.
Tesla is expected this week to report a big jump in its worldwide sales after slashing prices at the end of last year, and as customers took advantage of U.S. tax breaks. Founded in 2003, Tesla is on a path to sell about 1.8 million battery powered vehicles for the year, up from 1.3 million in 2022. It makes about half of all electric vehicles sold in the United States.
As Tesla and BYD rival for the spot as the world's most prolific maker of fully electric vehicles, both companies face increasing competition from legacy automakers that are spending billions of dollars to catch up.
"I think an industry shakeout is an inevitable trend," said Cui Dongshu, the secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association, which represents the country's domestic industry. "But it's still uncertain who will seize the future leading position in the long term."
As fast as China's electric vehicle sales are rising, companies are pouring money into factories and research, often fueled by loans from state-owned banks and assistance from municipalities. Nio, a top selling Chinese EV brand, said in November that it laid off 10 percent of its employees.
During the last year, Tesla has lost market share to rivals like General Motors, Hyundai, Ford Motor and Volkswagen as they introduced more electric vehicles.
BYD, which faces prohibitively high tariffs in the U.S. market, sells most of its cars in China but is expanding globally, particularly in Europe.
It announced in December that it would build an assembly plant in Hungary, its first production facility for battery-powered cars in Europe. In Germany, the seat of European auto making, it introduced three models of electric cars at the start of 2023. BYD has opened dealerships in Germany, Norway and Sweden.
As global competition for electric vehicles has gotten more intense, the political ramifications have been heightened. United States policymakers have made it harder for foreign companies to become partners with American companies.
And in Europe, lawmakers are investigating China's state subsidies, a step that could lead to tariffs imposed by the European Union.
Yet Europe's auto industry can't ignore China as a customer and business partner.
BMW, which has more than 30,000 employees in China, announced last spring that it would invest about $ 1.4 billion in battery assembly capacity at its factory in Shenyang in China's northeast.
Volkswagen, which counts China as its largest sales market, is moving more of its supply chain and manufacturing to China. The German giant is hiring thousands of Chinese engineers to design electric cars at its industrial complex in Hefei, a city in central China.

In South Korea, Family Succession Is Put to the Test: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When Koo Bon-moo, chairman of South Korean conglomerate LG, died in 2018, there wasn't much question, at least publicly, of who would next preside over the company.
LG, a $ 10 billion corporate empire, is governed by the principle of male primogeniture. Succession was effectively settled 14 years earlier when Mr. Koo and his wife adopted their eldest nephew, Koo Kwang-mo. The adoption was necessitated by tragedy and tradition after the couple's teenage son died in 1994, and their efforts for another male heir resulted in a second daughter.
The Koo family has controlled LG since it was founded in 1947, and the transition that elevated Kwang-mo to the helm seemed seamless, burnishing the family's reputation for harmony.
It wasn't.
The former chairman died, at age 73, without a will. What followed was a power struggle within the Koo family and LG over the inheritance of his estimated $ 1.5 billion fortune -- including his 11 percent stake in the company. Now, five years later, the former chairman's widow and two daughters are suing Koo Kwang-mo, accusing him and other LG executives of deception to steal their rightful inheritance to bolster his claim to the company.
The women said they want their full inheritance, but they are not seeking control of LG.
The lawsuit not only pits the matriarch of one of South Korea's wealthiest families and her daughters against the adopted male heir, who is now one of the country's most influential business figures. It also challenges LG's patriarchal tradition that allows the oldest male successor to seize power and wealth, leaving female family members as afterthoughts in the company.
Omnipresent in South Korea, LG is a holding company comprising 11 publicly traded businesses, including LG Chem, the country's largest materials and chemicals firm, and LG Electronics, whose televisions, dishwashers and other home appliances are popular worldwide.
The Koo family is one of a few wealthy clans -- along with the Lee family at Samsung, Hyundai's Chung family and SK's Chey family -- who run the conglomerates known as chaebols that have dominated South Korea's economy for decades.
In a legal filing that reads like a Korean drama script involving one of the country's biggest corporate employers, the former chairman's widow, Kim Young-shik, and her daughters, Koo Yeon-kyung and Koo Yeon-sue, accused LG executives of colluding with Koo Kwang-mo and his biological father to swindle them.
In transcripts of secretly recorded conversations filed in the legal documents, Koo Kwang-mo pleads with his adopted mother not to challenge the inheritance because it will hurt LG's image and his leadership of the company, potentially tarnishing his reputation among the Korean public.
"The scariest thing is the public opinion," he said, according to the transcript. "How are they going to look at this situation? 'Someone got greedy,' or that I didn't come visit and do a good job of caring for my mother."
In addition, the women accused Ha Beom-jong, the former chairman's aide and now LG's president, of misleading them to believe that there was a will that left everything to Koo Kwang-mo. Without a will, South Korean law states, the widow would be entitled to inherit one-third of the estate with the remainder divided equally between the two daughters and Kwang-mo.
Instead, the women said they were duped into an agreement in which roughly 75 percent of the estate went to Kwang-mo. The lawsuit, filed in Seoul Western District Court, seeks to redistribute the estate according to the legal standard.
"We cannot stand having our rights, protected under the constitution and the law, be disregarded just because we are women," the women said in a notice filed with the lawsuit.
Yulchon LLC, a law firm representing Kwang-mo, said in a statement that the inheritance is "a legally settled matter" that was resolved four years ago after extensive negotiations, and that there have been about 10 rounds of consultations and several revisions since the chairman's death. It also noted Ms. Kim had signed a document agreeing that Kwang-mo should receive the LG shares and assets related to controlling the company.
While LG is not a party to the lawsuit, it has also staged a vigorous defense of Kwang-mo in public statements. LG also suggested that the women were trying to challenge Koo Kwang-mo for company control, something that they deny.
"Any attempt to shake LG's tradition and management rights cannot be tolerated," the company said in a statement earlier this year.
LG's Deep Roots
The Koo lawsuit is one of several recent legal proceedings involving chaebols that highlight the challenges of family succession and control.
Lee Jae-yong, Samsung's executive chairman, is entangled in a criminal case accusing him of breaking the law to clear the way for the merger of two group affiliates that helped strengthen his control of the company. Mr. Lee has denied any wrongdoing.
Chey Tae-won, chairman of SK, the conglomerate behind the country's biggest mobile carrier, is embroiled in a divorce after 34 years of marriage. Last year, a Seoul court awarded his former wife about $ 50 million -- roughly 1 percent of his net worth -- but not any of his 17.5 percent stake in the company. She is appealing the ruling.
Woochan Kim, a finance professor at Korea University Business School, said these legal disputes will make it harder for the conglomerates to maintain control within the family.
"Family succession will cease to exist for very large Korean chaebols," Dr. Kim said.
LG was founded by Koo In-hwoi, Kwang-mo's great-grandfather, when the country was still emerging from Japanese colonial rule, and rival governments were being formed in the north and south, setting the stage for the Korean War. Originally called Lak Hui (pronounced "lucky") Chemical, the company's breakthrough product was a cosmetics cream. After changing its name to Lucky Goldstar, it produced goods for a modernizing Korea, including the country's first toothpaste, radio and washing machine.
By the time Koo Bon-moo, the founder's grandson and the oldest son of six siblings, took over in 1995, the company, now called LG, was deeply embedded in Korean life. LG built apartments, established an economic research institute and started a baseball team.
A year before Mr. Koo became chairman, his 19-year-old son died of a heart attack a few days after his high school graduation, leaving the family with one daughter but no male heir. Ms. Kim, the chairman's widow, said they tried for another son. Two years later, in her mid-40s, she gave birth to a daughter, Yeon-sue.
In a statement, Yeon-sue, now a 27-year-old musician, said that for her parents, the pain of losing a son was compounded by the succession issue.
"That's the way it is in my family," she wrote. "I used to feel guilty about the fact that I wasn't born a son."
Without a male heir, Ms. Kim said her father-in-law pressured them to adopt Kwang-mo -- then 26. He was the oldest son of Bon-moo's eldest brother, Koo Bon-neung. A decade after her son's death, Ms. Kim said she and her husband relented.
"For my father-in-law, that was really important," she said.
In 2017, Bon-moo was 72 and still seemed healthy, planning for the company's future and hiking on the weekends. He went to the doctor because his face appeared slightly lopsided, and he was diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer.
Bon-moo's brain surgery in April 2017 went smoothly but after a second operation in December, he suffered a seizure that left him unable to speak, sending his health into a downward spiral. He died in May 2018.
His death raised a possible succession battle. During his illness, the company was being run by one of his other brothers, Koo Bon-joon, who had led one of LG's most high-profile businesses. Koo Kwang-mo, who was 40 at the time, had been an LG executive for a decade but had accrued little management experience.
Bon-moo's ashes were scattered among trees, as was his wish. In the blur of the funeral proceedings, his wife and daughters claim, Kwang-mo's biological father and LG officials started angling for control.
Without notifying them, the women say, Kwang-mo's biological father and LG officials enlisted a locksmith to help them pry open the former chairman's safes at the company office and a vacation home.
Then Mr. Ha, who had been Bon-moo's aide, and another employee came to the family's stately home in Seoul and told them that the senior Koo had left a will, according to the women in interviews with The Times. His wishes, they recalled the employees telling them, were that all his shares and the chairmanship go to his adopted son, in keeping with family custom since LG's founding. Mr. Ha has denied in court testimony that he ever told the family there was a will.
"The person my father trusted the most and supposedly knew everything came to us and said there was a will, and based on that, it all goes to Kwang-mo," Koo Yeon-kyung, the eldest daughter, 45, said in an interview.
Succession Question
While LG is a publicly traded company with 220,000 employees, its finance department does more than handle the company's books. It also manages the personal assets and bank accounts of family members. Employees kept the personal seals for family members and routinely inked documents on their behalf.
In court testimony, Mr. Ha said that there wasn't a will but a memo with Bon-moo's wishes signed a few days before his first surgery. It was later shredded in the routine destruction of documents, he said, adding that he showed it to the women and Kwang-mo shortly after the former chairman's death. The women say they never saw it.
Ms. Kim, 71, said she was told she needed to forgo inheriting any of her husband's shares to ensure Kwang-mo's succession and prevent any challenge from her late husband's brother, Bon-joon. She said she went along with it, but she questioned Mr. Ha about whether Bon-moo truly wanted his daughters to receive no shares. She said Kwang-mo eventually agreed to give roughly a fifth of Bon-moo's shares, worth about $ 270 million by current share prices, to his two sisters.
They said while the older Koo was alive, they never questioned the family's patriarchal ways. Their expectation, they said, was that Kwang-mo, as his adoptive father and grandfather had before him, would make sure everyone in their extended family was financially taken care of and would carry out ancestral rites that are Korean tradition.
Yeon-kyung, the eldest daughter, said she was told that the terms of the inheritance should be guarded with utmost secrecy, so much so that she didn't talk to her husband or consult an attorney. The agreement was read out to her and her mother once, and they were never given a copy, she said.
The women said that they were told that they would receive the former chairman's cash, other investments and the family's home in Seoul, and that Kwang-mo would pay hundreds of millions of dollars in inheritance tax. South Korea levies a tax of at least 50 percent on inherited assets over $ 2.3 million.
Through the agreement, Kwang-mo strengthened his claim to be chairman. Before the former chairman's death, Kwang-mo owned 6.1 percent of LG shares. Koo Bon-joon, the brother who was running the company, held 7.6 percent. By inheriting most of the former chairman's stock, Kwang-mo's stake grew to about 15 percent.
He became the chairman of LG in June 2018. Bon-joon agreed to leave the company, but he wouldn't go away empty-handed.
LG announced in November 2020 that it was going to spin off five affiliate businesses into a new holding company with Bon-joon as the chairman.
The U.S. hedge fund Whitebox Advisors protested the move, calling it a "solution to a succession problem" that gave priority to family needs but went against the interests of outside investors in the company.
In response, Mr. Ha, the former aide who was now promoted to LG's chief financial officer, told investors the plan "will diversify investment risk and provide an opportunity" for LG and the new company.
Shareholders approved the spinoff. Shares of the new company, LX Holdings, started to trade publicly in May 2021. Bon-joon sold most of his LG shares later that year and used the proceeds to buy shares in his new company.
"Running a public company as a private fiefdom for the benefit of a controlling shareholder adversely affects minority investors and is a disincentive for outside investment," Simon Waxley, head of equity arbitrage at Whitebox, said in a statement to The New York Times.
Inheritance Dispute
The women said they continued living their lives normally. Yeon-kyung, who studied social work, said she remembered her father's wishes that she get involved in running LG's charitable foundations, and started working at one of them as an adviser in 2021.
Around that time, Yeon-kyung said, she felt something was amiss when she applied for a store credit card to get a discount on a gift for a friend, but was rejected because she had too many loans. She said that came as a surprise to her.
Realizing how little she, her sister and her mother knew about their own finances, she started going from bank to bank to pull years' worth of statements. There were large inheritance tax payments and loans against their LG shares that didn't comport with their understanding that Kwang-mo alone would shoulder the tax. When they started asking questions to LG's finance team, they felt they were getting partial or evasive answers, Yeon-kyung said.
They were told a copy of the inheritance agreement was kept in storage away from Seoul and would take weeks to retrieve.
As the women pieced together the state of their finances, they said, they realized that Kwang-mo had also received more cash and investment assets than they thought they had agreed to.
"Isn't that strange, it was our money but we didn't know how much we had," Yeon-kyung said. "It started to seem odd."
Growing mistrustful, Yeon-kyung said she and her mother began secretly recording conversations with Kwang-mo and Mr. Ha in 2022. Throughout the year, the exchanges grew tense, and at times, emotional, according to excerpts from transcripts, which the plaintiffs have cited as evidence that they were misled by the men now running LG.
In one recording from November 2022, Ms. Kim complained to Kwang-mo that they were treated by the finance staff as if they could be ignored because they were women.
"All this time has passed, and now that we look into it, so much was done without our knowledge," she said, according to a transcript.
"The 'our' you mention doesn't include me, right?" Kwang-mo asked in return.
Kwang-mo sent his mother a letter in January clarifying the unexplained withdrawals from her accounts. He said that, unbeknown to him, "the employees" were short on funds to pay the inheritance tax under his name, so they paid it under her name using her assets, but that they had planned to pay her back. Still, he asked her not to assert her inheritance rights.
"If the elders each asserted their rights under the inheritance law, LG's management control would not have been passed down to the 4th generation as it is now," he wrote in the letter.
A month later, the women filed suit.
In September, Kwang-mo came to the family home for Chuseok, a major Korean mid-autumn holiday, when more than 100 extended family members got together for the customary ancestral rites.
The family carried out the elaborate ceremony, paying their respects to deceased family members as they always had, but an awkwardness hung between Kwang-mo and his adoptive mother and sisters. He seemed to avoid them, ducking into different rooms in the cavernous home, the women said.
"He didn't make eye contact, or talk," Ms. Kim said. "He just hurriedly left."

Full text: Conglomerates that sprawl across the society trace their roots to the nation's rise into a world power and have been tightly controlled for generations.
For decades, South Korea's economy has been dominated by a handful of family-run conglomerates that hold outsize wealth and influence and factor into nearly every aspect of life in the country.
Because of their political heft, the chaebol, as these families are known, have long been a matter of immense public interest. The marriages, deaths, estrangements and legal troubles of these families are chronicled in the South Korean press. Fictional chaebol families have been depicted in Korean dramas. The Lee family of Samsung, the Koos of LG, the Cheys of SK, the Shins of Lotte and the Chungs of Hyundai are household names that have tightly held the reins of the companies that are some of the country's largest private sector employers.
Their power has been increasingly scrutinized -- both inside and outside South Korea -- as an economic vulnerability, deepening inequalities and fostering corruption.
Chaebol families have controlled South Korea's biggest companies for generations.
The chaebol system is a legacy of South Korea's history. After an armistice ended the Korean War in 1953, the country's military dictators anointed a handful of families for special loans and financial support to rebuild the economy. The companies expanded quickly and moved from industry to industry until they morphed into sprawling conglomerates.
Even as the companies grew in size, wealth and influence, and sold shares on stock exchanges, they remained under family control -- typically run by a chairman who also presided as head of the family. Generational leadership changes have sometimes unsettled chaebol families, forcing companies to split or spin off into smaller groups.
More than two decades ago, during a family struggle, Hyundai was divided among the founder's six sons. The eldest son took control of Hyundai Motor, now one of South Korea's biggest companies. Under Chung Eui-sun, the founder's grandson, the family is still in charge of the global automaker.
These conglomerates make up a sizable portion of South Korea's economy.
South Korea's rapid rise from postwar poverty to a major developed economy in a couple of decades was closely tied to the rise of chaebol companies. Their early successes boosted wages and living standards, and drove the country's exports.
The total sales of the five largest conglomerates have consistently made up more than half of South Korea's gross domestic product in the past 15 years, topping 70 percent in 2012, according to the book "Republic of Chaebol" by the economist Park Sang-in. Their businesses also permeate South Korean life -- from hospitals to life insurance, from apartment complexes to credit cards and retail, from food to entertainment and media, not to mention electronics.
Chaebol families have had cozy relationships with the political leadership.
Patronage from political leaders was crucial to the chaebol companies' growth into industrial conglomerates, particularly under the regime of Park Chung-hee, who came to power in a coup and ran the country for two decades until his assassination in 1979. For Mr. Park, the chaebol were an instrumental part of his ambition to enrich and industrialize South Korea. To that end, his government steered funds to companies that were cooperative with his agenda, protected them from competition and spared them of public accountability.
While the close ties between the government and the businesses have lessened in recent decades, political leaders still frequently turn to them for support or counsel. In turn, the companies have at times been shielded as being too vital to the economy to be broken up or scrutinized -- something critics have assailed as a "too big to jail" problem.
This summer, chaebol heads traveled with the South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, on a trip to Europe as part of South Korea's bid for the World Expo. They also accompanied him on his visit to the United States to meet with President Biden and were among the guests at a White House state dinner.
Several scandals have tarnished their public image.
Chaebol companies have become enmeshed in political corruption cases.
One of South Korea's biggest political scandals in recent years demonstrated the close ties between the political leaders and the family-run conglomerates.
Park Geun-hye, the country's former president, was ousted from office in 2017 and later sentenced to prison after she was convicted of bribery, abuse of power and other criminal charges. Ms. Park and a longtime confidante were found to have collected or demanded bribes from three chaebol conglomerates: Samsung, SK and Lotte. Ms. Park was pardoned in 2021 after serving almost five years of a 20-year prison sentence.
Lee Jae-yong, chairman of Samsung Electronics, the country's biggest chaebol, was also sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for his role. He was paroled and later pardoned by President Yoon in 2022, a move that allowed him to return to running the company.

Tighter Tax Credits May Hurt Electric Vehicle Sales: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Purchases of popular models like the Tesla Model 3 and the Ford Mustang Mach-E may no longer entitle buyers to tax savings because the cars do not meet tougher sourcing requirements.
Efforts to fight global warming could suffer a setback next year when new rules reduce the number of electric cars that qualify for a federal tax credit.
The credits, up to $ 7,500 a vehicle, have helped make electric cars more affordable, bringing the cost of some models below $ 30,000. Next year, for the first time, dealers will be able to give buyers the credit when they purchase a car, rather than telling them to claim it on their tax returns.
But qualifying for the subsidy will become more difficult on Jan. 1 because of Biden administration rules intended to encourage automakers to manufacture vehicles and parts in North America, while bypassing China. Most automakers are still years away from breaking their dependence on China for batteries and essential materials like refined lithium.
The stricter rules, which stem from the Inflation Reduction Act, throw up another impediment to electric vehicles. Sales of such cars and trucks are already growing less briskly than a year ago because of high interest rates and drivers' anxiety about finding charging stations.
Electric vehicles are still the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry, and Americans have already bought more than one million this year. Sales will rise another 32 percent in 2024, according to BloombergNEF, compared to 47 percent in 2023. But Ford Motor, General Motors and Tesla have slowed investment as the pace of growth has cooled.
The list of fully electric vehicles that qualify for tax credits was already limited. Under rules that took effect this year, the credit was available only to cars manufactured in North America.
To collect the full credit, carmakers also must meet quotas on how much of their battery components and certain raw materials come from the United States or trade allies. Tesla, General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Rivian and Nissan are the only companies offering electric cars that qualify for the at least a partial credit. Some plug-in hybrid cars from Audi, BMW, Chrysler, Jeep and Lincoln also qualify for tax breaks.
New rules kicking in on Jan. 1 add another set of restrictions, disqualifying vehicles containing components made in China or made elsewhere by a firm under the control of the Chinese government.
"If it was already confusing for consumers, it gets even more confusing," said Kevin Roberts, director of industry insights and analytics at CarGurus, an online marketplace.
Tesla, which accounts for half of all the electric vehicles sold in the United States, has warned on its website that the least expensive Model 3 sedan and a long-range version will no longer qualify after Dec. 31. The cars have a battery made in China. The existing credits lowered the price of the base Model 3 to around $ 30,000, on a par with similarly equipped gasoline cars like the Toyota Camry or Honda Accord.
The stricter rules will also disqualify Ford's Mustang Mach-E, which has been eligible for half the credit and was the fourth-most-popular U.S. electric vehicle this year. Ford is still figuring out whether the F-150 Lighting, an electric pickup, will be eligible, a spokesman said.
The rules are complex and could still be modified by administration officials, leading to confusion among industry executives. In the worst case, only a handful of vehicles will qualify.
Volkswagen said it is "cautiously optimistic" that its ID.4 electric sport utility vehicle, made in Chattanooga, Tenn., will continue to get the credit.
General Motors said it is assessing whether its electric lineup, which includes the Chevrolet Bolt and an electric version of the Silverado pickup, will qualify. Nissan, whose electric Leaf is eligible for half of the $ 7,500 credit, did not respond to a request for comment. Rivian, whose electric pickups and S.U.V.s have qualified, also did not respond.
There is another way drivers can benefit from the credit. Under an exception intended for businesses with vehicle fleets, the Inflation Reduction Act allows dealers to apply the subsidy to leased vehicles and pass it on to customers. That wrinkle has helped Hyundai and other foreign automakers remain competitive even though they do not produce electric vehicles and batteries in the United States.
More than 40 percent of Hyundai's electric vehicle sales are leases, a spokesman said, up from just 5 percent before new restrictions took effect this year. The same provision in the law has allowed people who lease cars made abroad by Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volvo and Polestar to receive the credit indirectly.
But leasing is not a panacea. Many people prefer to own their cars, and foreign automakers are sore that they have been excluded from the subsidy available to buyers. The electric vehicle credit "is overly complex and unfortunately creating customer and dealer confusion," Volvo Cars said in a statement.
But the lawmakers who drafted and passed the Inflation Reduction Act have said they wrote it to force carmakers to realign their supply chains. That is happening, but the changes will take some time to bear fruit.
The list of eligible vehicles could grow over the course of 2024 as carmakers ramp up U.S. production to qualify for the credits and other subsidies.
The Korean automaker Kia expects to begin producing the EV9, a seven-passenger electric sport utility vehicle, at a factory in Georgia next year. Those domestically assembled vehicles should be eligible for half the credit, or $ 3,750, a Kia spokesman said.
Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, Dodge, Ram and Jeep, plans to introduce six mass-market electric vehicles in 2024, including versions of the Dodge Charger, Jeep Wagoneer and Ram pickup. The company has not said whether the vehicles will qualify for credits.
Some hybrids, which have internal combustion engines and electric motors, will also qualify if they meet the sourcing requirements and have a battery with a capacity of at least seven kilowatt-hours.
The Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid will most likely still be eligible for a $ 7,500 credit, a company spokesman said, while buyers of the Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe and Jeep Wrangler 4xe hybrids are expected to be eligible for up to $ 3,750.
Market forces are pushing down the prices of electric vehicles, a trend that is expected to continue as carmakers increase production. The average list price of an electric vehicle fell to $ 63,000 in November from $ 68,000 a year earlier, according to CarGurus. The average list price of a vehicle with an internal combustion engine was $ 48,000, the same as in the previous year.
Federal subsidies and loans for battery factories and electric car plants are also helping to lower prices. At some point during the next several years, analysts expect electric vehicles to become less expensive than internal combustion models even without tax credits.
"The long-term trend is going to be one of reducing prices," Mr. Roberts of CarGurus said. "You are going to see more mainstream vehicles."

Tesla Recalling 2 Million Cars Over Autopilot: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Federal regulators pressed the automaker to make updates to ensure drivers are paying attention while using Autopilot, a system that can steer, accelerate and brake on its own.
Tesla's reputation for making technologically advanced cars suffered a blow on Tuesday when the company, under pressure from regulators, recalled more than two million vehicles. U.S. officials said the automaker had not done enough to ensure that drivers remained attentive when using a system that can steer, accelerate and brake cars automatically.
The recall by Tesla, the world's dominant maker of electric vehicles, was its fourth in less than two years and the most significant to date. It covers nearly all cars the company has manufactured in the United States since 2012, including its most popular, the Model Y sport-utility vehicle.
Tesla accounts for about half of the electric passenger cars sold in the United States, but its market share has been slipping as General Motors, Hyundai, Ford Motor and other automakers have begun selling electric models. In addition, recent public statements by Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, have been widely interpreted as antisemitic and offended some customers. The recall amounts to another dent in the company's image.
"There's no question" that the company's brand "has taken a hit this year," Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund, who is generally positive about Tesla, said on the social media site X, which is owned by Mr. Musk.
The recall follows an investigation into Tesla's driver-assistance system, Autopilot, which the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began in August 2021 after a series of accidents, some fatal, involving the technology. Autopilot is designed to control vehicles on its own when on highways. Tesla's owners manuals tell drivers that they should keep their hands on the wheel and take over if anything goes wrong.
The recall reflects regulators' concern that Tesla did not do enough to prevent drivers from misusing the system, including by turning it on while they travel local roads and by becoming distracted because they assumed that their car could drive itself.
What Tesla calls Autopilot is a collection of features allowing the car's technology to take over a vehicle's control to varying degrees. The feature singled out in the recall, Autosteer, can keep a car in a lane without driver intervention.
There may be "increased risk of a crash," the safety administration said, when Autosteer is engaged and drivers do not "maintain responsibility for vehicle operation."
To address that problem, Tesla said it would wirelessly update its cars to add new, more prominent visual alerts and checks when Autosteer is engaged to remind drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention to the road. Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.
Tesla said it did not agree with agency's assessment of the system. The company has maintained that Autopilot makes its cars safer.
Manufacturers are responsible for preventing foreseeable misuse of their technology, the transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, who oversees the auto safety agency, said during a meeting with reporters and editors at The New York Times on Wednesday.
"They're going to say that it's safer with these systems," Mr. Buttigieg said, referring to Tesla. "That could be true. But you know, a car with an airbag is safer than a car without an airbag. If the airbag blows up, we're still going to recall it."
On Monday, Tesla said on the X platform, "It is morally indefensible not to make these systems available to a wider set of consumers, given the incontrovertible data that shows it is saving lives and preventing injury," a response to an article in The Washington Post about the technology's flaws.
Some experts question whether Autopilot makes driving safer. Philip Koopman, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University who studies self-driving software, said that improvements in safety come almost entirely from one feature, automatic emergency braking, which is commonplace on all new vehicles.
"Autopilot is not a safety feature, it's a convenience feature," Mr. Koopman said.
The regulator said its investigation would continue.
The recall was "egregiously overdue," two Democratic senators -- Edward Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut -- said in a statement. "We urge N.H.T.S.A. to continue its investigations to spur necessary recalls, and Tesla to stop misleading drivers and putting the public in great danger."
The investigation is the most prominent example of a wider push and pull among government regulators and companies developing technologies that allow vehicles to drive on their own in certain situations.
In October, California regulators ordered Cruise, a G.M. subsidiary, to stop its driverless taxi service in San Francisco after a series of traffic mishaps, including one in which a Cruise car dragged a pedestrian 20 feet after a crash. The company has since suspended its driverless car operations across the country.
Mr. Buttigieg said that some companies have pushed out self-driving technology before it was proved to be safe for broad use. These companies, he said, were motivated in part by the large number of highway accidents and deaths. More than 30,000 people were killed in traffic accidents in the first nine months of this year, down 4.5 percent from a year earlier but about 6,000 more than in the same period in 2013.
"I think the culture in a lot of these companies is around getting to that promised land, where the faster we build this technology and the sooner we get it out there, the better off everybody will be because human drivers have a murderous track record," he said.
The auto safety agency said that in August 2021 it began investigating 11 incidents involving Tesla vehicles that were operating with Autosteer engaged. A series of meetings between the agency and Tesla followed, and the company decided this month to voluntarily administer a recall.
Over the course of its investigation, the safety agency said, it has reviewed 956 crashes in which Autopilot was engaged. Then it focused on 322 crashes, including frontal collisions and situations where Autopilot may have been accidentally engaged.
Tesla began issuing wireless software updates to certain vehicles this week, safety officials said. The remaining vehicles will receive updates later. Tesla has for years updated the software in its cars using cellular networks, usually overnight when cars are parked.
Depending on the hardware on a car, some updated vehicles will feature more prominent visual alerts as well as additional checks when using Autosteer. The feature will also be suspended if drivers repeatedly fail to use it responsibly.
Letters to Tesla owners notifying them of the update are expected to be mailed in February.
Tesla's recall this week is the latest episode to heighten public scrutiny of the automaker. In October, a California jury found that the company's driver-assistance software was not at fault in a crash that killed a Tesla owner and seriously injured two passengers.
Several similar cases are being litigated around the country. One involves a 2019 crash in Florida in which a Tesla operating on Autopilot on a country road ran through a stop sign and hit a parked car, killing Naibel Benavides, 22, and severely injuring her companion.
Todd Poses, a lawyer representing the family of Ms. Benavides, said the recall showed Tesla was aware Autopilot was being used on roads where it wasn't safe, and failed to restrict where it could be turned on.
"This accident never should have happened because it doesn't work on roads like this," Mr. Poses said on Wednesday, referring to Autopilot.
The driver of the Tesla had dropped his phone and bent down to look for it, trusting Autopilot to steer his Tesla Model S. But the car failed to stop at a T-intersection with a flashing red light.
"This technology is not safe, it needs to be off the roads," said Dillon Angulo, who was with Ms. Benavides and suffered a traumatic brain injury, a broken pelvis and a broken jaw.
Tesla has faced several other recalls. In May, China ordered Tesla to recall 1.1 million vehicles, citing an issue with the acceleration and braking systems of certain models manufactured in China and abroad.
A few months earlier, Tesla recalled more than 362,000 cars equipped with its Full Self Driving driver-assistance system, a more advanced technology than Autopilot, after U.S. regulators found it increased the risk of accidents.
The more advanced system allows vehicles to travel above legal speed limits and through intersections in "an unlawful and unpredictable manner," safety officials said.
And in early 2022, Tesla recalled 54,000 cars equipped with its Full Self Driving software to disable a feature that in certain conditions let the vehicles roll slowly through intersections without making required stops.
Tesla sells Full Self Driving separately from Autopilot. But the two services are underpinned by the same technologies. In the past, drivers who have not purchased the more advanced system have been able to use Autopilot on roads that are not highways.
The company's latest recall explains that drivers will be alerted when they are using Autopilot outside of roadways where the technology is intended to operate. But it is unclear whether they will still be permitted to use the technology in these situations.
"N.H.T.S.A. has forced Tesla to focus on the right issues," said Matthew Wansley, professor at the Cardozo School of Law in New York who specializes in emerging automotive technologies. "But everything depends on the details."

Tesla’s reputation for making technologically advanced cars suffered a blow Tuesday when the company, under pressure from regulators, recalled more than 2 million vehicles. U.S. officials said the automaker had not done enough to ensure that drivers remained attentive when using a system that can steer, accelerate and brake cars automatically.
The recall by Tesla, the world’s dominant maker of electric vehicles, was its fourth in less than two years and the most significant to date. It covers nearly all cars the company has manufactured in the United States since 2012, including its most popular, the Model Y sport-utility vehicle.
Tesla accounts for about half of the electric passenger cars sold in the United States, but its market share has been slipping as General Motors, Hyundai, Ford Motor Co. and other automakers have begun selling electric models. In addition, recent public statements by Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, have been widely interpreted as antisemitic and offended some customers. The recall amounts to another dent in the company’s image.
“There’s no question” that the company’s brand “has taken a hit this year,” Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund, who is generally positive about Tesla, said on social media site X, which is owned by Musk and was formerly known as Twitter.
The recall follows an investigation into Tesla’s driver-assistance system, Autopilot, which the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began in August 2021 after a series of accidents, some fatal, involving the technology. Autopilot is designed to control vehicles on its own when on highways. Tesla’s owners manuals tell drivers that they should keep their hands on the wheel and take over if anything goes wrong.
The recall reflects regulators’ concern that Tesla did not do enough to prevent drivers from misusing the system, including by turning it on while they travel local roads and by becoming distracted because they assumed that their car could drive itself.
What Tesla calls Autopilot is a collection of features allowing the car’s technology to take over a vehicle’s control to varying degrees. The feature singled out in the recall, Autosteer, can keep a car in a lane without driver intervention.
There may be “increased risk of a crash,” the safety administration said, when Autosteer is engaged and drivers do not “maintain responsibility for vehicle operation.”
To address that problem, Tesla said it would wirelessly update its cars to add new, more prominent visual alerts and checks when Autosteer is engaged to remind drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention to the road. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.
Tesla said it did not agree with agency’s assessment of the system. The company has maintained that Autopilot makes its cars safer.
Manufacturers are responsible for preventing foreseeable misuse of their technology, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who oversees the auto safety agency, said during a meeting with reporters and editors at The New York Times on Wednesday.
“They’re going to say that it’s safer with these systems,” Buttigieg said, referring to Tesla. “That could be true. But you know, a car with an air bag is safer than a car without an air bag. If the air bag blows up, we’re still going to recall it.”
On Monday, Tesla said on the X platform, “It is morally indefensible not to make these systems available to a wider set of consumers, given the incontrovertible data that shows it is saving lives and preventing injury,” a response to an article in The Washington Post about the technology’s flaws.
Some experts question whether Autopilot makes driving safer. Philip Koopman, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University who studies self-driving software, said that improvements in safety come almost entirely from one feature, automatic emergency braking, which is commonplace on all new vehicles.
“Autopilot is not a safety feature; it’s a convenience feature,” Koopman said.
The regulator said its investigation would continue.
The recall was “egregiously overdue,” two Democratic senators — Edward Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut — said in a statement. “We urge NHTSA to continue its investigations to spur necessary recalls, and Tesla to stop misleading drivers and putting the public in great danger.”
The investigation is the most prominent example of a wider push and pull among government regulators and companies developing technologies that allow vehicles to drive on their own in certain situations.
In October, California regulators ordered Cruise, a GM subsidiary, to stop its driverless taxi service in San Francisco after a series of traffic mishaps, including one in which a Cruise car dragged a pedestrian 20 feet after a crash. The company has since suspended its driverless car operations across the country.
Buttigieg said that some companies have pushed out self-driving technology before it was proved to be safe for broad use. These companies, he said, were motivated in part by the large number of highway accidents and deaths. More than 30,000 people were killed in traffic accidents in the first nine months of this year, down 4.5% from a year earlier but about 6,000 more than in the same period in 2013.
“I think the culture in a lot of these companies is around getting to that promised land, where the faster we build this technology and the sooner we get it out there, the better off everybody will be because human drivers have a murderous track record,” he said.
The auto safety agency said that in August 2021 it began investigating 11 incidents involving Tesla vehicles that were operating with Autosteer engaged. A series of meetings between the agency and Tesla followed, and the company decided this month to voluntarily administer a recall.
Over the course of its investigation, the safety agency said, it has reviewed 956 crashes in which Autopilot was engaged. Then it focused on 322 crashes, including frontal collisions and situations in which Autopilot may have been accidentally engaged.
Tesla began issuing wireless software updates to certain vehicles this week, safety officials said. The remaining vehicles will receive updates later. Tesla has for years updated the software in its cars using cellular networks, usually overnight when cars are parked.
Depending on the hardware on a car, some updated vehicles will feature more prominent visual alerts as well as additional checks when using Autosteer. The feature will also be suspended if drivers repeatedly fail to use it responsibly.
Letters to Tesla owners notifying them of the update are expected to be mailed in February.

U.A.W. Says 3 Carmakers Violated Labor Laws: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A week after declaring a drive to organize nonunion automakers, the United Automobile Workers union filed charges against three foreign manufacturers.
The United Automobile Workers union accused three foreign automakers on Monday of unfair labor practices, asserting that they had interfered with efforts by employees to build support for the union at U.S. plants.
The union said it had filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board contending that the automakers -- Honda, Hyundai and Volkswagen -- had tried to prevent workers from discussing U.A.W. representation at work and that the companies had discriminated against those who had done so.
The action came two weeks after the U.A.W. announced an effort to organize nonunion plants owned by 10 foreign-owned companies, along with the domestic manufacturers Tesla, Lucid and Rivian, which make electric vehicles. The union has tried unsuccessfully to unionize some of those companies' factories in recent years, but not simultaneously on such a wide scale.
The U.A.W. said Monday that hundreds of workers at Honda's plant in Greensburg, Ind., and at Hyundai's plant in Montgomery, Ala., and more than 1,000 workers at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., had signed cards expressing support for joining the union.
At Honda, the union said, workers "report being targeted and surveilled by management for pro-union activity," while at Hyundai, "management has unlawfully confiscated, destroyed, and prohibited pro-union materials in nonwork areas during nonwork times."
It said that Volkswagen "had harassed and threatened workers for talking about the union" and that it had "confiscated and destroyed pro-union materials in the break room," among other accusations.
In a statement, Volkswagen said that it took such accusations seriously and that it would investigate the matter. "Volkswagen respects our workers' right to determine who should represent their interests in the workplace," it said.
Honda said, "We have not and would not interfere with our associates' right to engage in activity supporting or opposing the U.A.W." Hyundai said that the union's depiction of the matter was not accurate and that its workers "may choose to join a union or not as is their legal right."
Shawn Fain, the U.A.W. president, lashed out at the three companies in a statement issued by the union. "These companies are breaking the law in an attempt to get autoworkers to sit down and shut up instead of fighting for their fair share," he said. "But these workers are showing management that they won't be intimidated out of their right to speak up and organize for a better life."
The U.A.W. is trying to organize foreign-owned plants after a six-week wave of strikes against the three Detroit automakers -- Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, which makes Jeep, Chrysler and other brands -- that resulted in contracts providing record wage increases and additional gains in benefits.
In addition to Honda, Hyundai and Volkswagen, the foreign companies that the U.A.W. said last week that it was targeting are Toyota, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru, Mazda and Volvo.
The new contracts at Ford, G.M. and Stellantis raise the top hourly wage to $ 40 at the end of the four-and-a-half-year term, from $ 32 previously. Hourly wages at the foreign automakers in the United States generally range from the high teens to the high 20s.
After the U.A.W. agreements with the Detroit automakers were reached this fall, Honda said it would provide raises of 11 percent next year, and Hyundai said it would increase pay 14 percent next year and 25 percent by 2028. Toyota also announced raises.

U.S. to Limit China's Role In E.V. Sales: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The Biden administration issued new rules to prevent Chinese firms from supplying parts for electric cars set to receive billions of dollars in tax credits.
The Biden administration proposed new rules on Friday aimed at shifting more production of electric vehicle batteries and the materials that power them to the United States, in an attempt to build up a strategic industry now dominated by China.
The rules are meant to limit the role that firms in China can play in supplying materials for electric vehicles that qualify for federal tax credits. They will also discourage companies that seek federal funding to build battery factories in the United States from sourcing materials from China or Russia.
The rules could encourage shifts in automotive supply chains, which continue to rely heavily on China for materials and components of electric vehicles. Automakers are also facing intense cost pressures as they try to modify their factories to make electric cars, and China offers some of the most advanced and lowest-priced battery technology in the world.
The Biden administration is trying to use billions of dollars in new federal funding to change that dynamic and create a U.S. supply chain for electric vehicles.
The climate law that President Biden signed in 2022 includes up to $ 7,500 in tax credits to consumers who buy electric vehicles made in the United States using largely domestic materials. The law also included a general ban on Chinese products. Lawmakers mandated that firms in China, Russia, North Korea and Iran be prohibited from providing certain materials to cars that received those tax breaks.
But the law left open several questions, including what constitutes a Chinese or Russian company. Administration officials said those definitions included any entity that was incorporated or had headquarters in China or Russia, as well as any firm in which 25 percent of the board seats or equity interest was held by Chinese or Russian governments.
Chinese companies that set up operations outside China appear to be able to benefit from the rules as long as the Chinese government is not a significant shareholder. That provision came as a relief to some automakers, which feared that the Biden administration might bar them from contracting with Chinese-owned mines or factories in the United States or other parts of the world.
The law also requires battery makers that strike contracts or licensing agreements with Chinese firms to ensure that they are retaining certain rights over their projects. That provision is intended to make sure a Chinese firm is not effectively in control of such a project.
Some conservative lawmakers had challenged Ford Motor's plans to license technology from the Chinese battery giant known as CATL for a plant in Marshall, Mich., arguing that such a partnership should not be eligible for federal tax credits.
Some Republican lawmakers suggested on Friday that the Treasury Department's guidance did not go far enough to lessen the country's dependence on China.
"At a time when China is using massive subsidies to undercut U.S. manufacturers and throttle the global market for battery components, Treasury's naïve new regulations would open the floodgates for American tax dollars to flow to Chinese companies complicit in trade violations and forced labor abuses," said Representative Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.
The rules kick in for battery components in 2024, and in 2025 for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and nickel. They could be adjusted depending on industry comment.
The rules could have a profound impact on the U.S. electric vehicle market, which is rapidly growing -- battery-powered vehicles made up about 8 percent of new cars sold in the third quarter. Car and battery makers said Friday that they were still reviewing the rules, and that it would take time to determine how many models would qualify for tax credits.
Tesla said on Friday that the two least expensive versions of its Model 3 sedan would qualify for only half the $ 7,500 credit starting in January. The Model Y sport utility vehicle also might not qualify for the full credit after Dec. 31, Tesla said. The Model Y and Model 3 are the top two electric vehicles by sales in the United States. Tesla buys some batteries from CATL.
John Bozzella, the chief executive of Alliance for Automotive Innovation, wrote in a blog post Friday that the rules struck "a pragmatic balance," including by exempting trace materials. If the administration had banned all minor Chinese parts from the supply chain, no car models might have qualified for tax credits next year, he said.
Many cars have already been disqualified from purchase credits by other rules, like a requirement that vehicles be assembled in North America. Only about 20 vehicles currently qualify for the program out of more than 100 electric vehicles sold in the United States.
The rules also raised new questions about whether stricter requirements for supply chains could continue a trend of driving more shoppers to lease, rather than buy, vehicles.
The prohibition on sourcing from China applies only to vehicles that are sold, not to those that are leased. Consumers can receive tax credits for electric vehicles they lease from auto dealers, and that has led to a boom in E.V. leasing.
Jack Fitzgerald, chairman of Fitzgerald Auto Malls, which operates dealerships in Florida, Maryland and Pennsylvania, said he had seen a spike in customers leasing electric vehicles. But he said concern about electric vehicle range and the availability of chargers, more than price, was holding back electric vehicle sales.
"That's the principal thing," Mr. Fitzgerald said.
Auto industry lobbyists have warned that extremely strict rules could stifle electric vehicle sales, and they have urged the administration to strike more trade deals to secure supplies of scarce battery minerals. But Paul Jacobson, the chief financial officer of General Motors, said the company had structured its electric vehicle operations to be successful regardless of the federal rules.
"We're not anchoring the business on saying this has to happen" with regard to regulations, Mr. Jacobson told reporters on Thursday. If regulations change, he added, "it's not a backbreaking thing for us."
While the rules may create headaches for automakers, they are likely to benefit companies planning to supply batteries from factories in the United States.
"It's actually good news for us," said Siyu Huang, chief executive of Factorial, a Massachusetts company that is developing next-generation electric vehicle batteries with support from Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai and Stellantis, the owner of Dodge, Jeep and Ram.
Acquiring large amounts of lithium, an essential ingredient in batteries, could be difficult because most of the metal is processed in China, Ms. Huang said. But the rules will encourage investment in U.S.-based refineries, she continued. "Its definitely going to be another incentive to build more domestic supply," Ms. Huang said.
John DeMaio, chief executive of Graphex Technologies, which is building a factory in Michigan to process graphite for batteries, said the rules might temporarily slow electric vehicle sales by making it harder to qualify for the tax credit. But in the long run, he added, they will encourage investment in domestic suppliers.
"It might be a hiccup," he said, "but in general it provides certainty and clarity to get people off the fence."
Wally Adeyemo, the deputy secretary of the Treasury Department, said in a briefing with reporters that the rules would help advance the administration's goals of building up an American clean energy supply chain while also cutting emissions in the transportation sector.
"These changes take time, but companies are making the investments and Americans are buying these cars," he said.
Over the past year, companies have invested $ 213 billion in the manufacturing and deployment of clean energy, clean vehicles, building electrification and carbon management technology in the United States, according to tracking by the Rhodium Group and the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. That is a 37 percent increase from a year earlier.
.
Still, the global electric vehicle industry remains heavily anchored in China, which is the world's largest producer and exporter of electric vehicles. China produces about two-thirds of the world's battery cells, and refines most of the minerals that are key to powering an electric vehicle.
The rules also restrict automakers from sourcing nickel used in their batteries from Russia, which is one of the world's largest nickel producers.
One of the challenges for automakers will be developing systems to track all the components of their battery through a long, and often opaque, supply chain.
Vehicles that are reported incorrectly will be subtracted from an automaker's eligibility for tax credits, Treasury said, and automakers that commit fraud or intentionally disregard the rules could be declared ineligible for the credit in the future.

WASHINGTON — The Biden administration proposed new rules Friday aimed at shifting more production of electric vehicle batteries and the materials that power them to the United States, in an attempt to build up a strategic industry now dominated by China.
The rules are meant to limit the role that Chinese firms can play in supplying materials for electric vehicles that qualify for federal tax credits. They will also discourage companies that seek federal funding to build battery factories in the United States from sourcing materials from China or Russia.
The rules could encourage shifts in automotive supply chains, which continue to rely heavily on China for materials and components of electric vehicles. Automakers are also facing intense cost pressures as they try to modify their factories to make electric cars; China offers some of the most advanced and lowest-priced battery technology in the world.
The Biden administration is trying to use billions of dollars in new federal funding to change that dynamic and create a U.S. supply chain for electric vehicles.
The climate law President Joe Biden signed in 2022 includes up to $7,500 in tax credits to consumers who buy electric vehicles made in the United States, using largely domestic materials. The law also included a general ban on Chinese products. Lawmakers mandated that firms in China, Russia, North Korea and Iran be prohibited from providing certain materials to cars that received those tax breaks.
But the law left open several questions, including what constitutes a Chinese or Russian company. Administration officials said those definitions included any entity that was incorporated or had headquarters in China or Russia, as well as any firm in which 25% of the board seats or equity interest was held by Chinese or Russian governments.
Chinese companies that set up operations outside China appear to be able to benefit from the rules, as long as the Chinese government is not a significant shareholder. That provision came as a relief to automakers, which feared that the Biden administration might ban them from contracting with Chinese-owned mines or factories in the United States or other parts of the world.
The law also requires battery makers that strike contracts or licensing agreements with Chinese firms to ensure that they are retaining certain rights over their projects. That provision is intended to make sure a Chinese firm is not effectively in control of such a project.
Some conservative lawmakers had challenged Ford Motor Co.’s plans to license technology from the Chinese battery giant known as CATL for a plant in Marshall, Michigan, arguing that such a partnership should not be eligible for federal tax credits.
Some Republican lawmakers suggested Friday that the Treasury Department’s guidance did not go far enough to lessen the country’s dependence on China.
“At a time when China is using massive subsidies to undercut U.S. manufacturers and throttle the global market for battery components, Treasury’s naive new regulations would open the floodgates for American tax dollars to flow to Chinese companies complicit in trade violations and forced labor abuses,” said Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.
The rules kick in for battery components in 2024 and in 2025 for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and nickel. They could be adjusted depending on industry comment.
The rules could have a profound effect on the U.S. electric vehicle market, which is rapidly growing; battery-powered vehicles made up about 8% of new cars sold in the third quarter. Car and battery makers said Friday that they were still reviewing the rules and that it would take time to determine how many models would qualify for tax credits.
Tesla said Friday that the two least expensive versions of its Model 3 sedan would qualify for only half the $7,500 credit starting in January. The Model Y SUV also might not qualify for the full credit after Dec. 31, Tesla said. The Model Y and Model 3 are the top two electric vehicles by sales in the United States. Tesla buys some batteries from CATL.
John Bozzella, CEO of Alliance for Automotive Innovation, wrote in a blog post Friday that the rules struck “a pragmatic balance,” including by exempting trace materials. If the administration had banned all minor Chinese parts from the supply chain, no car models might have qualified for tax credits next year, he said.
Many cars have already been disqualified from purchase credits by other rules, like a requirement that vehicles be assembled in North America. Only about 20 vehicles currently qualify for the program out of more than 100 electric vehicles sold in the United States.
The rules also raised new questions about whether stricter requirements for supply chains could continue a trend of driving more shoppers to lease, rather than buy, vehicles.
The prohibition on sourcing from China applies only to vehicles that are sold, not to those that are leased. Consumers can receive tax credits for electric vehicles they lease from auto dealers, and that has led to a boom in EV leasing.
Jack Fitzgerald, chair of Fitzgerald Auto Malls, which operates dealerships in Florida, Maryland and Pennsylvania, said he had seen a spike in customers leasing electric vehicles. But he said concern about electric vehicle range and the availability of chargers, more than price, was holding back electric vehicle sales.
“That’s the principal thing,” Fitzgerald said.
Auto industry lobbyists have warned that extremely strict rules could stifle electric vehicle sales, and they have urged the administration to strike more trade deals to secure supplies of scarce battery minerals. But Paul Jacobson, chief financial officer of General Motors, said the company had structured its electric vehicle operations to be successful regardless of the federal rules.
“We’re not anchoring the business on saying this has to happen” with regard to regulations, Jacobson told reporters Thursday. If regulations change, he added, “it’s not a backbreaking thing for us.”
While the rules may create headaches for automakers, they are likely to benefit companies planning to supply batteries from factories in the United States.
“It’s actually good news for us,” said Siyu Huang, CEO of Factorial, a Massachusetts company that is developing next-generation electric vehicle batteries with support from Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai and Stellantis, the owner of Dodge, Jeep and Ram.
Acquiring large amounts of lithium, an essential ingredient in batteries, could be difficult because most of the metal is processed in China, Huang said. But the rules will encourage investment in U.S.-based refineries, she continued. “Its definitely going to be another incentive to build more domestic supply,” Huang said.
John DeMaio, CEO of Graphex Technologies, which is building a factory in Michigan to process graphite for batteries, said the rules might temporarily slow electric vehicle sales by making it harder to qualify for the tax credit. But in the long run, he added, they will encourage investment in domestic suppliers.
“It might be a hiccup,” he said, “but in general, it provides certainty and clarity to get people off the fence.”
Wally Adeyemo, deputy secretary of the Treasury Department, said in a briefing with reporters that the rules would help advance the administration’s goals of building up a U.S. clean energy supply chain while also cutting emissions in the transportation sector.
“These changes take time, but companies are making the investments, and Americans are buying these cars,” he said.
Over the past year, companies have invested $213 billion in the manufacturing and deployment of clean energy, clean vehicles, building electrification and carbon management technology in the United States, according to tracking by the Rhodium Group and the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. That is a 37% increase from a year earlier.
Still, the global electric vehicle industry remains heavily anchored in China, which is the world’s largest producer and exporter of electric vehicles. China produces about two-thirds of the world’s battery cells and refines most of the minerals that are key to powering an electric vehicle.
The rules also restrict automakers from sourcing nickel used in their batteries from Russia, which is one of the world’s largest nickel producers.
One of the challenges for automakers will be developing systems to track all the components of their battery through a long and often opaque supply chain.
Vehicles that are reported incorrectly will be subtracted from an automaker’s eligibility for tax credits, Treasury said, and automakers that commit fraud or intentionally disregard the rules could be declared ineligible for the credit in the future.

U.A.W. Aims To Unionize More Plants: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The United Automobile Workers' effort, with a long-elusive goal, follows its success in securing big raises in contracts with the Detroit automakers.
The United Automobile Workers union announced Wednesday that it was undertaking an ambitious drive to organize plants owned by more than a dozen nonunion automakers, including Tesla and several foreign companies -- a goal that has long eluded it.
The move comes weeks after the U.A.W. won new contracts from General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis that included wage increases of 25 percent or more over four and a half years for its 146,000 members employed there.
In addition to Tesla, the targets of the drive are two other electric vehicle start-ups, Lucid and Rivian, and 10 foreign-owned automakers: Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru, Volkswagen, Mazda and Volvo.
The U.S. plants owned by those companies employ nearly 150,000 workers in 13 states, the union said.
If the organizing drive gains momentum, it could become one of the largest by the U.A.W. since its infancy in the 1930s. The union's past efforts to organize even single plants owned by the foreign automakers, concentrated in the South, came to nought. A foothold among those companies would signal a big shift in the American auto industry, where nonunion manufacturers have long had a significant cost advantage over the Detroit automakers.
The union said the organizing drive had been prompted by inquiries from several thousand workers at nonunion plants.
"Workers across the country, from the West to the Midwest and especially in the South, are reaching out to join our movement and to join the U.A.W.," the union's president, Shawn Fain, said in a video posted on Facebook. "The money is there. The time is right."
A Honda statement cited the automaker's "competitive wages and benefits," adding, "We do not believe an outside party would enhance the excellent employment experience of our associates." Hyundai referred to its "excellent wages and benefits," adding, "Our team members have not shown an interest in union representation." Subaru pointed to wage increases and its benefits package but did not comment directly on the union drive. Rivian and Volkswagen said they had no comment.
At the DealBook Summit conference sponsored by The New York Times on Wednesday, Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, said, "If Tesla gets unionized, it will be because we deserve it and we failed in some way." He reiterated his opposition to unions, saying that "it's not good to have an adversarial relationship" between groups within a company.
The other companies did not respond to requests for comment.
On Wednesday, the U.A.W. activated websites where workers can electronically sign cards that serve as an official certification of their desire to have union representation. Earlier, at a handful of plants, the U.A.W. had already received signed cards from more than 30 percent of the work force, the threshold required under federal law for the union to move forward with a vote on unionization, a person familiar with the matter said.
The union is now working to send organizers to areas around these nonunion plants to collaborate with workers at those factories, this person said.
After the U.A.W. reached agreements with the Detroit automakers to raise wages, Toyota, Honda and Hyundai announced that they, too, would increase workers' pay.
Toyota has told workers that it will raise hourly rates 9 percent in January. Honda will lift wages 11 percent and Hyundai 14 percent next year. Hyundai plans to increase wages 25 percent by 2028.
The U.A.W. said Wednesday that it was making a concerted effort to organize a large Toyota plant in Georgetown, Ky., that employs about 7,800 workers and produces the Camry sedan and RAV4 sport utility vehicle.
U.A.W. members have long earned more than nonunion workers. At plants in the South, wages tend to start below $ 20 an hour and top out at less than $ 30. The top U.A.W. hourly wage, previously $ 32, climbed to more than $ 40 in the contracts the union signed with the three Detroit manufacturers.
The U.A.W. has fallen short twice in the past decade -- by narrow margins, in 2014 and 2019 -- in unionization votes at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tenn. The U.A.W. lost by a substantial margin at a Nissan plant in Canton, Miss., in 2017. Organizing efforts at other companies' plants have petered out before coming to a vote.
But after Mr. Fain became the union's president this year, the union promised a more aggressive approach to its contract talks with the Big Three and vowed to renew efforts to widen its reach in the industry.
In addition to wage gains at the Detroit companies, the U.A.W. won agreements to preserve jobs and to keep open a Stellantis plant in Illinois that had been slated to close.
Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said the U.A.W.'s wage gains created a stronger case for joining the union.
"It shows collective bargaining works and shows the U.A.W. was successful," he said. "They can say: 'We saved this plant. Look at what we got. You can have this, too."'
Past organizing drives were hurt because the U.A.W. had a tarnished image, Mr. Wheaton added: Many unionized plants had closed, its members had been required to accept wage and benefit cuts to help the Detroit manufacturers survive the 2009 financial crisis, and federal corruption investigations had implicated senior union officials.
"A lot of the negative things about the union -- a lot of that stuff has gone away now," Mr. Wheaton said.

Electric Cars Face Rules On China: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Some firms argue that a law aimed at popularizing electric vehicles risks turning the United States into an assembly shop for Chinese-made technology.
The Biden administration has been trying to jump-start the domestic supply chain for electric vehicles so cleaner cars can be made in the United States. But the experience of one Texas company, whose plans to help make an all-American electric vehicle were upended by China, highlights the stakes involved as the administration finalizes rules governing the industry.
Huntsman Corporation started construction two years ago on a $ 50 million plant in Texas to make ethylene carbonate, a chemical that is used in electric vehicle batteries. It would have been the only site in North America making the product, with the goal of feeding battery factories that would crop up to serve the electric vehicle market.
But as new facilities in China came online and flooded the market, the price of the chemical plummeted to $ 700 a ton from $ 4,000. After pumping $ 30 million into the project, the company halted work on it this year. "If we were to start the project up today, we would be hemorrhaging cash," said Peter R. Huntsman, the company's chief executive. "I'd essentially be paying people to take the product."
The Biden administration is now finalizing rules that will help determine whether companies like Huntsman will find it profitable enough to participate in America's electric vehicle industry. The rules, which are expected to be proposed this week, will dictate the extent to which foreign companies, particularly in China, can supply parts and products for American-made vehicles that are set to receive billions of dollars in subsidies.
The administration is offering up to $ 7,500 in tax credits to Americans who buy electric vehicles, in an effort to supercharge the industry and reduce the country's carbon emissions. The rules will determine whether electric vehicle makers seeking to benefit from that program will have the flexibility to get cheap components from China, or whether they will be required instead to buy more expensive products from U.S.-based firms like Huntsman.
The lawmakers who wrote the climate bill, including Senator Joe Manchin III, the West Virginia Democrat, included language that bars an electric car from qualifying for the tax breaks if the critical minerals or other components used in its battery were made by "a foreign entity of concern." Lawmakers defined that as any firm that is owned by, controlled by or subject to the jurisdiction of North Korea, China, Russia or Iran.
But they left it up to the Biden administration to fill in the details, including important questions like what constitutes a Chinese company, and what product qualifies as a "battery component."
The administration faces a tricky calculation with the new rules. If it allows more companies to qualify for the benefits, Americans will have a wider choice of low-cost electric vehicles to choose from. That would put more clean cars on the road and help to mitigate climate change. It could also help to shore up the finances of U.S. automakers that are losing heavily on electric vehicle production.
But such a path could undercut the administration's other priority -- to build more secure supply chains for electric vehicles. The government has been aiming to use the climate law to boost manufacturing of electric vehicles and their parts in the United States and in allied countries, and reduce dependency on China, which dominates global markets for electric vehicles and their batteries.
The effort to balance these concerns has touched off a fight between automakers and parts manufacturers, U.S. miners and labor unions.
Automakers have been awaiting the guidelines with trepidation.
Carmakers like General Motors and Hyundai, spurred by the new climate law, are racing to build factories in the United States to produce batteries and process materials like lithium. But they are still years away from being able to produce an electric vehicle without materials and components from China, auto industry representatives say.
China dominates production of materials, like graphite and processed lithium, that are essential to the flow of electricity within a battery, and to the cathodes and anodes, the basic building blocks of a battery. Through both formidable government subsidies and enormous economies of scale, Chinese firms now sell some of the world's most advanced electric vehicles and the components used to make them at much lower prices than competitors in other countries.
Automakers are also under intense pressure to keep costs down by buying from the cheapest suppliers. Ford Motor lost $ 1.3 billion on electric vehicles in the third quarter, the company said last month, equaling a loss of $ 36,000 on every vehicle it sold.
In June, Tesla, which sources key parts from China, submitted comments to the government arguing that the coming restrictions on foreign entities should be less restrictive. The limits on foreign purchases should be confined to major battery parts, like the cathode and anode, not the various minerals or other parts used to make them, Tesla proposed.
In the worst case, said Albert Gore III, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, "you can have vehicles made in the U.S., with the vast majority of parts coming from the U.S., that could be disqualified from the tax credit because a single part comes from China." Mr. Gore, whose organization counts Tesla as well as battery makers as members, said he expected the administration to strike a balance.
In contrast, miners and other makers of battery materials and components say that allowing China to supply cheap parts could open the United States to a flood of foreign products. That would ensure that the United States was merely an assembly point for Chinese-made technology and products, and leave the U.S. economy highly vulnerable, they say.
So far, the climate law appears to have done more to stimulate investment in factories to make electric vehicles and their batteries than in the mines and facilities that produce the minerals, chemicals and smaller components that go into the battery itself.
In fact, the only cobalt mine planned in the United States, owned by Jervois in Idaho, temporarily closed this year. The company blamed cratering prices, caused by a new rush of material produced by China. Jervois restarted some exploratory drilling this fall, thanks to new funding from the Defense Department.
Until the final rules are issued, some companies have halted plans for new U.S. investment, conscious that their business calculations could change significantly in the coming months.
"You're seeing a bit of a holding pattern until the final guidance is released by the administration," said Abigail Seadler Wulf, the vice president and director of critical minerals strategy at Securing America's Future Energy, a nonprofit organization.
Mr. Huntsman said that unless the government restricted the use of Chinese materials, there was no point in investing further in the company's Texas project. He said the Chinese government was heavily subsidizing the production of ethylene carbonate, allowing Chinese firms that account for 90 percent of the global production of the chemical to sell it so cheaply.
"The question, really, is how does the United States want to respond to this?" he asked.

Broadcom Closes Deal for Cloud Firm VMware
Broadcom on Wednesday closed its $ 69 billion acquisition of the cloud-computing firm VMware after receiving regulatory approval in its last major market, China, and ending a monthslong saga.
The deal, one of the biggest globally when announced in May 2022, was the latest in the chief executive Hock Tan's efforts to increase the chipmaker's software business.
China's regulatory approval came through on Tuesday after ongoing tensions with the U.S. around tougher chip export control measures had stoked fears among some investors on the company's ability to close the deal before the Nov. 26 deadline.

Volkswagen Will Raise Salaries at Factory 11%
Volkswagen said on Wednesday that it would raise salaries 11 percent for production workers at its assembly plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., weeks after the United Auto Workers union won major pay and benefit increases from the three Detroit automakers.
The company and other nonunion automakers in the U.S. have come under increased pressure to improve pay and benefits after the record contracts achieved by the U.A.W. in late October after thousands of its members went on a six-week targeted strike.
Honda and Toyota have raised wages for nonunion U.S. factory workers in recent weeks amid signs that the union is turning its attention to organizing the work force at foreign-owned and Tesla auto plants.
Hyundai Motor has also announced a 25 percent increase over the next four years for nonunion production workers in Alabama and Georgia. REUTERS

Higher Borrowing Costs Could Hinder Deere
Deere forecast 2024 profits below analysts' expectations on Wednesday, saying high borrowing costs and tighter budgets will likely dent demand for the farm equipment maker's agriculture and construction machinery.
Deere, a barometer for the global economy, predicted a downturn in agriculture and construction equipment sales across all of its regions for the fiscal year ahead, validating analysts' concern that demand may have peaked for big industrial companies.
The company now expects 2024 net income between $ 7.75 billion and $ 8.25 billion, far below the consensus for $ 9.33 billion, according to LSEG data.
The heavy equipment maker's net income for the quarter rose to $ 2.37 billion, or $ 8.26 per share.
Despite beating Wall Street profit estimates, the manufacturer's stock slump mirrors peers such as Caterpillar that also outperformed forecasts. REUTERS

Full text: The United Automobile Workers union hopes the agreements with General Motors, Ford and Stellantis will help it make inroads at other companies.
Members of the United Automobile Workers union have given their backing to new contracts with the three big U.S. automakers, agreements that deliver hefty wage increases and other gains that had eluded the union for more than 20 years.
In the most closely contested vote, the tentative contract agreement at General Motors won the support of 55 percent of the nearly 36,000 members casting ballots, according to a tally from all the G.M. locals that the union posted on Thursday.
Tentative agreements with Ford Motor and Stellantis, the maker of brands including Jeep and Chrysler, appeared headed for approval by more decisive margins, nearly complete results there showed.
A spokesman for the union confirmed the accuracy of the tallies but declined to comment further.
The agreements are similar across the three automakers and raise the top wage for production workers 25 percent, to more than $ 40 over four and a half years, from $ 32. They were reached last month after a six-week wave of strikes that hobbled the companies -- a strategy spearheaded by the union's new president, Shawn Fain, who had vowed to take a more adversarial approach to negotiations than his predecessors.
The agreements appear to have quickly reverberated across the auto industry, with Toyota, Hyundai and Honda announcing significant wage increase at nonunion plants in the United States only days later.
"We call that the U.A.W. bump, and that stands for 'U Are Welcome,"' Mr. Fain said in testimony before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee this week. "And we're very proud of that. And when these workers decide to organize and join the U.A.W., they're going to realize the full benefit of union membership and get what they're fully due."
The new contracts also included larger company contributions to workers' retirement plans and the right to strike over plant closures. All three automakers declined to comment on the ratification votes.
Mr. Fain said the union was seeking to capitalize on its momentum by waging muscular organizing campaigns at nonunion plants, and, in remarks submitted to the Senate committee, he added that thousands of workers were already contacting the union and signing union cards.
But even Mr. Fain's tough approach in the talks with the Big Three did not yield terms attractive enough to many union members. G.M. workers at several large plants voted against the tentative agreement by large margins.
In contrast, members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters recently approved a new contract at United Parcel Service with 86 percent support, while a new contract between the Writers Guild of America and Hollywood studios passed with 99 percent support.
Rebecca Givan, a labor studies professor at Rutgers University, said Mr. Fain had achieved a major victory despite having taken office only a few months earlier with a goal of reorienting the union.
Dr. Givan said the union's approach of initially striking at one plant at each of the three automakers and ramping up over time had "really upended a lot of conventional wisdom" in the labor movement and had proved unusually successful at reversing some concessions that the union had accepted years earlier, like the suspension of a cost-of-living adjustment.
"This shows that if workers build enough power, they can win things back," she said.
U.A.W. members at Mack Truck also ratified a contract on Wednesday, after rejecting an initial agreement with the company.
Across the three automakers, skepticism toward the agreements arose in large part from veteran workers who felt that the proposed contracts did not go far enough to compensate them for years of concessions and weak wage growth, even given strong gains for newer workers. Wages for some newer workers will more than double over the next four years.
Huey Harris, a G.M. employee at a large truck assembly plant in Flint, Mich., who has worked at the company for over 20 years, said the deal should have gone further in rewarding veteran workers, though he ultimately voted for it. "The traditional people didn't think they were offered enough in the contract," he said.
Several longtime employees of the Big Three automakers said that even after the large gains of the new contract, they would not be making more than when they started their careers.
Curtis March, who works at Ford's Chicago Assembly Plant, said he made about $ 18 an hour once he reached the top wage for production workers at the company in the early 1990s, equivalent to more than $ 40 today when adjusted for inflation. He will make about $ 36 in the first year of the new contract.
Mr. March said the deal was likely to pass at Ford because it placated more recent employees, who outnumber veterans like him. Workers at his plant approved the deal after voting against several previous contracts.
Despite the ultimate success, the path to ratifying the contracts has included some internal strains for Mr. Fain and the union. Unite All Workers for Democracy, a reform group that played a key role in electing Mr. Fain and six other members of the U.A.W. executive board to their positions, declined to formally recommend that union members approve the contract even after Mr. Fain urged the group to do so at a recent meeting, according to three people familiar with the meeting. Instead, Unite All Workers passed a resolution committing it to stay neutral during the ratification vote, though it stated that the group "celebrates the record gains made in this agreement."
Two of these people also said the union's General Motors department had been less communicative and less proactive in distributing information about the contract to local union officials and members than the Ford and Stellantis departments.
The union declined to comment on these developments.
Ratification could also bring political benefits to President Biden, who waded into the negotiations over the summer and fall, and who risked angering business leaders by increasingly siding with the union's members.
Administration officials were taken aback in August when Mr. Fain called for a 40 percent raise for autoworkers and a four-day workweek. Executives at the Big Three called the White House to ask if Mr. Fain was serious. A senior administration official said Biden aides had reassured them that the union wanted a deal, but acknowledged that the negotiations could go quite differently from the way the automakers were used to.
In mid-September, when Mr. Biden was in New York for meetings at the United Nations General Assembly, he joined aides on a video call to make a decision that he and his team had been building toward for weeks: to join autoworkers on a picket line in Detroit. That decision infuriated executives, the administration official said, but the White House saw it as a victory for the president and for workers, by making a clear statement about where Mr. Biden stood in the negotiations.
Some autoworkers argued that the union had erred by failing to expand the strike, which eventually included about one-third of the companies' unionized workers in the United States, even more.
LaDonna Newman, another longtime Ford worker who opposed the contract because of its limited gains for veteran workers, said she believed the union could have won more at the bargaining table had it been willing to escalate further.
Still, she did not blame Mr. Fain for the outcome. "He walked into a burning building," Ms. Newman said. "I give him a lot of kudos for having the courage to go against the corporations."

Long-Timers Are Resisting G.M. Deal: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Many longstanding General Motors workers have been voting against the tentative accord, which they feel insufficiently improves retirement benefits.
A United Automobile Workers union vote on a tentative contract agreement with General Motors that provides record wage increases has run into unexpectedly strong resistance from veteran workers.
Voting at most union locals has been completed and the final result, due as early as Thursday evening, will very likely be decided by a narrow margin. A majority of workers at several large plants in Michigan, Indiana and Tennessee rejected the contract, though union members at a large sport utility plant in Arlington, Texas, voted in favor of it.
G.M., Ford Motor and Stellantis agreed to similar contracts with the union after U.A.W. members went on strike at select plants and warehouses. Workers walked off the job at the first three plants on Sept. 15 and stayed on strike for more than 40 days. It was the first time the union has struck all three automakers at the same time, though it did not shut down all of the factories of any company.
The agreement appears to be headed for ratification at Ford and Stellantis, the maker of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram vehicles, by comfortable margins, according to running tallies the U.A.W. published online.
At G.M., many veteran workers have opposed the contract because they want the company to contribute more money to retirement plans and the cost of health care for retirees.
"I've heard from some traditional workers who said there wasn't enough in there for them," said David Green, director of the U.A.W. Region 2B, which includes Ohio, Indiana and a small part of Michigan. He voted for the contract.
David Miller, a 20-year G.M. veteran who works at a big truck assembly plant in Flint, Mich., said the absence of retiree health benefits was the reason he had voted no. "I'm not voting yes on any contract that doesn't have that in it because I don't need the health care when I'm 25 -- I'm 65," he said. "I'm at the mercy of Medicare."
General Motors declined to comment on the contract vote.
The tentative contract raises the top wage by 25 percent, from $ 32 to more than $ 40 over four and a half years. The increase is more than the combined wage increases the union has won over the past 22 years, according to U.A.W. officials.
Newer hires who are lower on the pay scale will see larger increases that take them to the new top wage. And workers who were recently hired will see their hourly pay double.
The agreement also provides for cost-of-living adjustments that will nudge wages higher if inflation persists as well as enhanced company contributions to pensions and retirement plans, more paid time off and the ability to strike if any plant is closed during the term of the contract.
To be ratified, the agreement must secure a simple majority. More than 46,000 U.A.W. workers work at G.M., although not all of them are likely to turn in ballots. More than 14,000 company employees took part in the targeted strikes.
As of Wednesday afternoon, an online vote tally that the union maintains showed that just over 54 percent of the votes were in favor of the contract, but that tally did not include numbers from some big plants.
If the tentative agreement is voted down, it will represent a big setback for the U.A.W. president, Shawn Fain, who was elected this year and promised to take a more aggressive approach in the contract talks in hopes of winning significant pay increases and reversing some of the concessions the union accepted in past contracts.
He appeared to deliver that in what was widely regarded as a record deal. President Biden, who joined striking workers on the picket line in September at a G.M. site in Belleville, Mich., hailed Mr. Fain's efforts. The president joined Mr. Fain last week at a plant in Belvidere, Ill., that Stellantis agreed to keep open after halting production this year.
"I don't think it diminishes Shawn Fain's luster that much because of a close ratification vote," said Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations. "It just means expectations were high, and had he not delivered as much as he did, it wouldn't have passed."
After the contracts with the three Detroit automakers are ratified, Mr. Fain hopes to try to organize workers at nonunion plants in the South owned by Toyota, Honda and other foreign automakers, and the nonunion plants that Tesla operates in California and Texas.
Since the terms of the U.A.W. agreements were announced, some of those companies have increased wages of factory workers. Toyota has told workers that it will raise hourly rates by 9 percent in January. Honda and Hyundai will lift wages 11 percent and 14 percent next year. Hyundai plans to increase wages 25 percent by 2028.
"Everybody at those companies should say, 'Thank you, U.A.W.,"' Mr. Wheaton said. "Those increases wouldn't have happened without the new U.A.W. contract."

After U.A.W.'s Agreement, More Carmakers Raise Pay
South Korean automaker Hyundai has joined Honda and Toyota in raising factory wages after the United Auto Workers reached new contract deals with Detroit automakers.
Hyundai said Monday it will raise factory worker pay 25 percent by 2028, matching the general wage increase won by the U.A.W. Toyota raised factory pay 9 percent to 10 percent starting in January, while Honda said it will increase wages 11 percent during the same period.
Labor experts say the increases are at least in part aimed at thwarting U.A.W. President Shawn Fain's strategy of trying to organize U.S. auto plants run by foreign automakers and Tesla. Mr. Fain said terrified auto executives at nonunion plants are raising wages, and he called Toyota's pay increase the U.A.W. bump.
"U.A.W., that stands for 'You Are Welcome,"' he said.

Emirates Plans to Buy
$ 52 Billion of Boeing Jets
Long-haul carrier Emirates opened the Dubai Air Show on Monday with a $ 52 billion purchase of Boeing aircraft, showing how aviation has bounced back after the groundings of the coronavirus pandemic, even as Israel's war with Hamas clouds regional security.
Its low-cost sister airline, FlyDubai, followed up with an $ 11 billion order of 30 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, the first wide-body aircraft in its fleet. Together, the sales marked a significant win for Virginia-based Boeing on the first day of the air show, as airlines appear poised for even more billion-dollar deals this year.
Emirates C.E.O. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said the carrier would purchase 90 Boeing 777 aircraft, 55 of them 777-9 variants and 35 of them 777-8s.
Emirates will also add five 787 Dreamliners to its previous order of 30, Sheikh Saeed said.

Continental Plans to Cut Thousands of Workers
The German car parts manufacturer Continental said on Monday that it would cut thousands of jobs in its automotive division worldwide as part of a plan to save 400 million euros ( $ 428 million) a year from 2025.
The exact number of job cuts was not immediately clear, but it will amount to the "mid-four-digit range," the company said.
The news comes amid ongoing reports that Continental plans a restructuring and potential sell-offs, with its C.E.O., Nikolai Setzer, saying in September he was considering a change in ownership of the company's ContiTech division.
The works council of the automotive division urged the company in an internal statement seen by Reuters to rule out outright dismissals and use all possible measures to keep its work force on, from part-time retirement for older workers to retraining and reallocating staff.

Full text: I GREW UP in India with all the major world religions. I attended a Christian boarding school in a Hindu-majority country that is roughly tied with Pakistan for the second-largest Muslim population in the world. My mother's family were Sikhs, and I counted among my closest friends a Jew from Bombay and Buddhists from Tibet. Pilgrimage is common to all of these faiths, even as it is utterly distinctive. In Islam, the pilgrimage to Mecca is an ordained pillar of faith that the Prophet Muhammad performed himself. In Christianity, the culture of cherishing relics and visiting holy places is said to have begun with Saint Helena -- the mother of Constantine I, the first Roman emperor to convert to Christianity in 312 -- rushing off to the Holy Land in search of the True Cross. Some pilgrimages enshrine sorrow, like the Ashura in Iraq, which would be the last stop on my journey; others, like fiesta in Bolivia's Copacabana, are pilgrimages of joy and rapture. Some are historical, like the Jewish commemoration of exile; others, like the Mecca pilgrimage, represent the repurposing of an older sanctity, in this case that of pre-Islamic Arabia. Some pilgrimages focus on a single day, others a season, a month, an auspicious alignment of the stars. In India, which has some of the greatest scenes of pilgrimage anywhere in the world, such as the Kumbh Mela, where every 12 years the largest gathering of humanity on earth -- more than 100 million -- comes together at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers, I had also witnessed the touching intimacy of a family or group of friends who set out for a holy place on a Sunday, just as someone might go fishing or to a national park in the United States.
It was the ordinariness of this latter kind of pilgrimage, away from the grand spectacles of Ashura and fiesta, that I had hoped to capture in Buddhist Mongolia. I had imagined springtime pilgrimages, people visiting monasteries as the weather warmed. If La Paz is the highest capital in the world, Ulaanbaatar is the coldest, with January temperatures reaching minus 30 degrees. In fact, even as I was setting out at the end of May, my guide and translator, Orgilbaatar Tsolmon, who goes by Orgil, was sending me videos of snow showers in the Mongolian capital.
My flight from New York connected through Istanbul; the first leg was 10 hours, and from there we flew another eight hours in a level line across the face of Asia. The Black Sea gave way to the Caspian and, beyond, to a land of mountain, desert and steppe. The Mongols, led by Genghis Khan and his descendants, poured over the steppe in the 13th century and, in the words of the 18th-century British historian Edward Gibbon, "the caliphs fell, and the Caesars trembled on their throne," even as representatives of the major faiths -- from Islam and Nestorian Christianity to Taoism and myriad forms of Buddhism -- would come before the great khans to make their case for why their particular creed ought to be the official religion of the empire.
My first glimpse of Mongolia was of rolling hills draped in thin emerald grass, of cloud shadows the size of lakes and of raking beams of morning light breaking through a heavy sky. "Nomadism," I scribbled in my notebook in a sleepless haze, "captures the very spiritual heart of pilgrimage, which is to wander." If the Latin peregrinus gives us "pilgrim," it also gives us "peregrination."
Orgil was waiting for me at Chinggis Khaan International Airport in Ulaanbaatar with a red Nissan SUV. My first thought on seeing him, with his long hair and light beard, was of the Nepalese artist Araniko's late 13th-century rendering of Kublai Khan, Genghis Khan's grandson. "In Xanadu, did Kubla Khan / A stately pleasure-dome decree. ..." The Coleridge poem was the first I had committed to memory as a child, during a blackout in Delhi, but Kublai was more than the figment of an opium dream. He was a full historical personage who founded the Yuan dynasty (1279-1368) in China and established Beijing (then known as Dadu) as its capital, and was the man whose conversion to Buddhism around 1258 brought shamanic Mongolia into the orbit of Tibetan Buddhism.
The influence of Buddhism grew sporadically for almost seven centuries in Mongolia, merging in profound ways with its ancient worship of nature -- of mountains, water, the eternal blue sky. But then, in the early decades of the 20th century, Buddhism encountered a mortal enemy: Soviet-backed Communism. Even by the standards of a tumultuous century, the Stalin-directed purges of the late 1930s stood out for their systematic eradication of Mongolia's religious culture. The great majority of the country's monastic institutions were leveled to the ground; some 18,000 monks were killed; and, in a society where about one-third of the adult male population were lamas (though not all living in monasteries), Buddhism was ripped out root and branch.
In 1990, with the fall of Communism, religious freedom was established in Mongolia and Buddhism was allowed to be practiced again. My first destination was the Khamar monastery, 300 miles south in the Gobi Desert, which had been all but destroyed in 1938. It was said to be situated at one of the portals to Shambhala -- a mythical kingdom of peace and tranquillity in the Buddhist imagining -- and had been founded in the century before by an artist, saint and sybarite called Danzanravjaa, known as the lama of the Gobi. Bolivia had given me new respect for the survival of the sacred, despite great political and historical upheavals, and I was curious to see what pilgrimage would look like in a place where it had been stamped out for generations -- curious to see the old pilgrim routes leading back to the locus of sanctity, like neural pathways reforming around an area of trauma.
MONGOLIA, BROADLY SPEAKING, is a country with half the landmass of India and a population smaller than that of Los Angeles proper -- some 3.3 million people -- of which about half live in Ulaanbaatar alone. As we left the capital's new Japanese-built airport armed with supplies of chips, Snickers, Coke Zeros and vodka as offerings, I gained a first impression of an unnerving emptiness. After some initial settlements of white yurts, or gers, as they're known here, and houses with brightly colored corrugated roofs behind dark wooden stockades, all signs of habitation fell away. On that morning in late May, spectral wisps of snow blew over the long two-lane highway, and the wind was so strong that I found it difficult to put my jacket on outside the car.
Amid what seemed like trackless wastes there periodically appeared the giant ragged form of an ovoo, or cairn. Its beanpole of a body was bandaged in blue khadags (prayer scarves), its stony mound of a base littered with vodka bottles and the occasional skull of a dead animal. The ovoo is a monument to the spirits of the natural world, known here as nagas and savdags. Orgil, following the custom of honoring these easily offended beings, lest they punish you for your neglect, honked three times as we went by. "This is the Gen Z way," he said, grinning, "but I prefer the old way," which involves circling the ovoo on foot three times in a clockwise motion.
But it was too cold to stop. It was too cold to smoke, too cold to take a pee. The temperature was only in the low 30s, but the wind bit through me, and it was hard to believe that this was a relatively mild spring day by Mongolian standards. Outside Choir, a dust-bitten town halfway to the monastery, we inhaled a lunch of mutton broth and dumplings, fried rice and a meat-stuffed pastry called a khuushuur. Then we drove on, another four hours. The land turned arid and flat. Double-humped Bactrian camels appeared along the side of the road. An enticing band of opalescent sky offered the relief of a horizon after hours of rain and snow.
Orgil, in between telling me of his days in a metal band, when "I drank beers left and right," would occasionally grow serious. "During Communism," he said, "we lost our national identity." The purges of the 1930s plundered the country's monasteries and temples -- there had been some 700 in the 19th century -- which Orgil described as repositories of folklore, history, traditional medicine and learning. Mongolia, after winning independence from Qing China in 1911, began those early decades of the 20th century as a feudal theocracy with a godlike figure, akin to the Dalai Lama, called the Bogd Khan at its helm, overseeing around 80,000 monks. (The Dalai Lama recently introduced a Mongolian child as the 10th reincarnation of the Bogd.) "They shot all the head lamas," Orgil said. "They murdered all the teachers." The fires from the monasteries were rumored to have burned for weeks. Christopher Kaplonski, a social anthropologist who has conducted research in Mongolia, has written that, though the total number of Mongolians killed between 1937 and 1939 is unknown, "credible estimates range from 35,000 to 45,000."
As evening fell, we arrived at the ger camp on the edge of the Gobi, a short drive from the Khamar monastery. We were the only ones there. Orgil had made me worried that there would be no pilgrims at all. Bolivia was a lesson in the imperishability of the sacred, but it had also shown me how places of pilgrimage, like the sacred crag on the Island of the Sun, could die. If you ban a religion for more than half a century, murder its clergy and raze its monasteries, as the Communists had in Mongolia, then maybe you do deal it a death blow?
I was full of dark thoughts when the ger camp began magically to fill. I'd just finished a dinner of banshtai tsai, dumplings in a goat milk and tea broth, and retired to my ger, where I was watching the wood-burning stove cast shadows on the wooden lattice and felt walls, when I heard electronic music blaring into the Gobi. I stepped outside to see the neat rows of gers now brightly lit, noise and chatter pouring out of their doorways. Bottles of soda were being ferried back and forth and mixed with vodka. Prim, lightly made-up girls sat on the edges of what looked like the Mongolian equivalent of a frat party. "Who are these people?" I asked Orgil in amazement. "Pilgrims," he answered. Some were part of a construction company, others students with exams on the horizon. They had come to draw energy from Shambhala. The rites the next morning were to begin before dawn, yet the pilgrim parties, with their Chaucerian feeling of intimacy among strangers, continued raucously into the night.
Just before daybreak, at 4:20 a.m., we joined a cavalcade of SUVs off-roading through the desert, drawing ruby red parabolas over the dunes. Our first stop was a fertility shrine near the monastery. On a hill were two mounds of sand and rock with stone finials, connected by a beam that was wrapped in the blue prayer cloths. Women in puffer jackets with cartons of milk went back and forth between the shrine and the edge of the hill, casting their offerings of milk into the air. Orgil told me that no man could perform the rite unless his mother had died in the past 49 days, in which case he could perform it on behalf of her spirit.
The sun rose over the Gobi, showing reddish earth and black-edged dunes. The sky was a cold, motionless blue. While the women performed the ritual, I spoke to a group of men in their late 30s and early 40s who worked for a real estate company in Ulaanbaatar. One was an economist, another a lawyer, a third a businessman. They had arrived by train from the capital. "I came here to recharge my energy and cleanse my spirit," said Egi, the economist. (Mongolians use patronymics rather than Western-style surnames; in conversation, people often go by just one name.) "This place is a world energy center." When I asked if the ritual had been handed down to him by his parents, he said, "They knew about it, but they were not authorized to come. We are the lucky generation." He added: "This Shambhala reminds us that we are not just ordinary nomads. We had an enlightened one [Danzanravjaa] live among us." Since the transition to the democratic era, Egi said, "Mongolian people have come to know that we have a great religious and cultural heritage."
Munkhdul, the businessman, said in halting English, "It's a reconnection in modern times to the past of our life." Some moments later, our band of pilgrims (about 50 to 100) reconvened outside the gateway to the Shambhala complex, where a pair of mesmeric half-closed eyes, painted on a wall of pinkish orange, gazed out at us, symbolizing the inward-turned sagacity of the Buddha. Stepping across the threshold, we found ourselves in a rectangular enclosure of red earth marked out by a perimeter of white stupas. It was like being in a Zen garden, where one proceeded from one station to another, performing a series of rituals and rites under an open sky. In the distance, the level sands of the Gobi fell away as far as the eye could see. It was an austere, heart-stopping glimpse of the void.
Our guide, Haidav, was from the Gobi region. In his early 30s now, he had been selected as a boy by Gandantegchinlen (often referred to simply as Gandan), the country's main monastery in Ulaanbaatar, to spend four years in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, where, at a center of Tibetan Buddhism -- the Namdroling monastery, popularly known as the Golden Temple -- he had been educated in the religion of his forefathers with the express aim of reintroducing it to Mongolia. As he led us into the Shambhala, he seemed less like a guide than like a monk re-educating his countrymen about a faith whose core precepts, such as the belief in karma and reincarnation, had survived the ravages of Communism, but whose rituals had to be relearned from scratch. Our group was composed almost entirely of Mongolians, but no one knew what to do at the various stations any more than I did.
At the genie's belly, a low mound of dark rocks, Haidav told us to exhale all of our sins and bad thoughts, intentional and unintentional. At the site of Danzanravjaa's ger, which was just a circle in the sand, we offered handfuls of grain. We wished that "with the help of the enlightened one, we would be reborn into the Shambhala." Then we went to three other circles representing past, present and future. Haidav told us to walk not through but around them. We had open bottles of vodka in our hands and made offerings into the air. (Milk and vodka! It was a combination I would encounter time and again in this nomadic post-Soviet society.) Haidav told us not to wish for money or material things but only that which was regenerative -- a child, rain or power. He placed a special emphasis on looking in, on harmony and balance. He said that all the bad things that happen to us, whether ill health or failure in our careers, were emanations of what was within and, in cleansing the inner sphere, we could succeed in the outer.
If pilgrimage is exteriorized mysticism, a way for human beings to grasp spiritual truths, the Shambhala felt almost like a cosmogram or mandala, a metaphysical scheme writ small. We came to a circle of red rocks that was the energy heart of the whole enclosure. Here, we sat down. Some lay on the rocks and rolled from side to side. The aim was to draw in the energy of the place. I talked to Samdanbazar, a 78-year-old herder from Töv Province, in the environs of Ulaanbaatar. She wore a gold-and-purple deel, a long coat of sorts, fur lined in the winter, with tiny earrings, her dyed hair whitening at the roots. Watching her roll back and forth, taking such obvious pleasure in the rite, I couldn't help but ask what it had been like to be denied all of this for the first 45 years of her life. "We had to hide everything," she said. "My father was a lama, so we had to hide our thangkas [Tibetan Buddhist cloth paintings], Buddhas and religious artifacts."
Our last station was the Golden Skull Hill, where a central ovoo overlooked the desert beyond. There we chanted, "Um sain amgalan boltugai" -- "may there be peace with you" -- and sang "Ulemjiin Chanar" ("Perfect Qualities"), a Mongolian folk song that Danzanravjaa had composed himself. Haidav was almost scolding in the care with which he instructed us to sing as a chorus. "Whatever your failures," he said at the end of our morning at the Shambhala, "it's because of your mind."
THE EMPHASIS ON interiority, on isolating the self as the site for spiritual advancement and failure, felt very different from the Christian pilgrimage in Bolivia. The focus there had been outward: on Mary, her miracles, on what she could give you. Here, almost everyone spoke of enlightenment from within and of certain corrosive human emotions, anger being among the gravest of them, that would impede that progress. In Mongolia, the texture of sin felt less like a crime against God than against oneself. Three symbols are often associated with Danzanravjaa's life and thought: a female figure representing his love of pleasure; a swan symbolizing the arts; and, lastly, a scorpion signifying the human potential for self-destructiveness. Outside our ger camp, there was a giant metal sculpture of a black scorpion, its tail raised, surrounded by desert sands on all sides. It stood as a reminder of the cardinal sin in the Buddhist scheme: rage, which, like the myth of the scorpion, makes us our own worst enemies, liable to sting ourselves in the head.
Kublai Khan may have laid the foundation for the rise of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia, but it was a man called Zanabazar -- a monk, scholar and artist -- who solidified its position. In everything from scripture to ritual, temple design and even religious fashion, including monastic robes with blue cuffs evoking the blue sky that Genghis Khan claimed to worship, the hand of Zanabazar is visible.
At the Erdene Zuu monastery, founded by Zanabazar's great-grandfather in the 16th century after the declaration of Tibetan Buddhism as the state religion of Mongolia, I witnessed an amazing scene, proof of the cocktail of motives that puts us on the road to pilgrimage. Erdene Zuu, with its green-tiled roofs in the Chinese style, is Mongolia's oldest monastery, built in 1586. It is also located near the ruins of the Mongol capital at Karakorum, about 530 miles from Khamar monastery. On entering Erdene Zuu's vast, grassy complex, with its perimeter wall crenelated with white stupas and nothing but big sky on all sides, I felt the spirit of a Mongolian camp. Nomadism harbors a disdain for materiality, yet it was hard not to feel myself on consecrated ground, even if only in historical terms. It was mainly from here that the descendants of Genghis Khan in the 13th century brought the world to its knees, from present-day Ukraine to Korea. The site had more recent memories, too. Of its 62 temples and some 500 facilities, the vast majority had been destroyed during the ravages of the 1930s. All around me, amid a handful of stupas and temples, were the flattened foundations of buildings in the religious complex. There had been 1,500 lamas here in the 19th century; there were fewer than 50 today. At the entrance, I spoke briefly to Mandakhtsog Monkhbaatar, who was in his early 20s, dressed in orange-and-red robes with those huge turquoise cuffs and high boots with blue piping. Like Haidav, he had spent years studying at the Golden Temple monastery in India, relearning the traditions that Communism had left Mongolian Buddhism too depleted to teach. Monkhbaatar's great-grandfather had been a prominent lama in the southwestern province of Bayankhongor. When I asked the young monk about him, he said casually, "He was murdered," then rushed into the great complex, where the morning chants were set to begin.
A plump child lama in a plumed yellow cap appeared on the wooden watchtower of a temple whose sloping white facade evoked the Potala in Lhasa, Tibet -- the winter palace of the Dalai Lamas. A conch shell sounded three times. Knots of pilgrims and tourists milling about outside drew near. Inside, monks sat chanting on wooden benches in a blue-ceilinged room hung with thangkas. Sutras wrapped in yellow silk rotated on a turnstile. As bells and chanting reached a crescendo, amid clouds of incense, a woman in a black-and-copper deel, her schoolteacher's face tremulous with ardor, came rushing in. She then began to perform full-bodied prostrations in the aisle between the monks, some chanting, others laughing or charging their phones. Again and again, as the tempo rose around her, this thin, bespectacled woman prostrated herself in ecstasy, doing what is known in Sanskrit as ashtanga pranam, or the eight-body-part salute: hands, feet, knees, chest and chin. Watching her, I was reminded of a pilgrim I had once seen at a shrine in central India. He had looked like a bureaucrat or bank clerk, the ordinariness of his appearance only amplifying the extraordinariness of his actions. I'd watched him take a rock and place it on the floor a few feet away and then lie flat on the ground face down and wriggle his way toward it. He'd repeated the same gesture several times until he circled the shrine. "This," the young Brahmin whom I'd been traveling with said to me, "is bhava" (a kind of rapture). Later, I learned that the woman at Erdene Zuu was a 40-year-old herder from Inner Mongolia, the region of the country that had remained part of China after present-day (Outer) Mongolia won its independence in 1911. She told me that she'd been a devout Buddhist since she was a child. "It's the most perfect religion because it enlightens from within," she said. But it wasn't just Buddha who had brought her to Erdene Zuu. She said she came for Genghis Khan, too. "He was our ancestor," she said of the founder of the Mongol Empire -- who was not Buddhist but shamanic. "I wanted to receive the particular energy of this man here, in what was the capital of the Mongol Empire and of Buddhism."
"So is this a religious pilgrimage for you, or a nationalistic one?" I asked.
"It is both," she said. "For Mongolians, this is a sacred place. This is ancestral land." When I asked her if she felt Chinese at all, she said, "I'm 100 percent Mongol, even if I live in the part that's China. We may live in different locations, but that doesn't change the fact that we're all Mongols."
When I asked for her contact details, she demurred, explaining that to share them was unsafe. Then, as I was walking away, she came rushing after me, imploring me not to post the pictures we had taken together on any social media or mention her by name in whatever I wrote. It was a reminder that political peril had always been part of the calculus of pilgrimage, whether in the Middle Ages, when Islam's conquest of the Holy Land gave rise to local shrines, such as Santiago de Compostela and Canterbury, or now, for this pilgrimage-within-a-pilgrimage of a Mongolian herder, honoring her ethnic and spiritual ancestor, irrespective of any national boundary.
Growing up in India, I witnessed the intersection of religion and nationalism canalized into a militarized form of pilgrimage. In 1990, the Hindu nationalist leader L.K. Advani led a rath yatra, or "chariot pilgrimage," from Somnath temple in the western state of Gujarat, where a major Hindu temple saw the first of many assaults upon it in the 11th century. The yatra, steeped in historical pain and revenge, was headed for the city of Ayodhya, a thousand miles away in Uttar Pradesh, where a 16th-century mosque -- named after the Emperor Babur, who, incidentally, was a descendant of Genghis Khan and the founder of the Mughal (derived from Mongol) dynasty -- stood on the alleged site of what was the birthplace of the Hindu god Ram. The yatra was stopped before it got to Ayodhya, and Advani arrested, but the rage he had tapped into was not so easily contained. Two years later, on Dec. 6, 1992, a mob of kar sevaks, or religious volunteers, some coming as pilgrims with bricks for the construction of a new temple, destroyed the mosque. Religious riots ensued, and hundreds died. Ayodhya was the crucible that led to the ascendancy of Hindu nationalism in India. Two decades on, it gave rise to the majoritarian politics of Narendra Modi. Pilgrimage offered a release from the monotony of daily life, but it also galvanized people in the service of faith, often at the expense of other faiths, and over such a wholesale recruitment of people sent away from home full of religious zeal there forever hung the specter of a crusade.
ORGIL AND I drove some 1,500 miles in five days, off-roading over what felt like the spine of Asia: valleys of spring flowers with ancient burial sites encircled by gently creased hills of green velvet. Orgil let me drive. The full expanse of the steppe, streaked with islands of shadow, opened up around us. Sometimes the sky would darken and a storm would roll in, turning the furrowed hills a morose green; then a herd of semi-wild, rain-drenched horses might assemble at the center of the road. I had never seen such emptiness. I felt myself in a country where animals outnumbered people many times over. It was as exhilarating as it was disquieting -- the solitary sight of a ger in the distance, the cattle-covered crest of a hill dotted black, beige and white, as if the fickle hand of nature had taken up pointillism. It was easy to imagine this changeless landscape as one where people were especially attuned to the spirits of the natural world. "Throughout Mongolia it is believed," Orgil said, "that if you pollute the water, the savdag will be angry at you, so we don't even pour milk into the water, which we consider to be the purest thing." That shamanic worship had fertilized Mongolian Buddhism, giving it its distinct character, which in turn, because of the influence of Tibetan Buddhism, already included certain esoteric teachings, practices and rituals, known in classical India as the Tantras.
I hardly saw Ulaanbaatar until the end of my time in Mongolia. The location of the capital once known to Mongols as Khuree, meaning "monastery," and later to the Russians as Urga, had not been fixed until the late 1700s and, even today, the city of nearly 1.7 million has the air of a giant encampment. A suburban sprawl of ger neighborhoods -- ramshackle houses and yurts -- surround a Soviet-style city center of decaying apartment blocks and bureaucratic behemoths touched up with blue glass and steel.
Here, the Gandan monastery, the de facto Vatican of Mongolian Buddhism, was the only such institution allowed to remain partially open during Communism. Although it was closed during the purges of the late 1930s, Munkhbaatar Batchuluun, 45, a jovial lama who handled communications for the monastery, explained that it owed its survival to a cynical act of tokenism. Henry Wallace, Franklin D. Roosevelt's vice president at the time, was in Mongolia on a fact-finding mission in 1944, and the Communist government wanted to show that some modicum of religious freedom existed in Mongolia. Thus the Gandan, though hollowed out, was permitted to stay open as a Potemkin monastery. Mongolia had come as close as any society to having eradicated a religious way of life, with deep roots in the social fabric, yet here, too, as so often on this pilgrimage of mine, the sacred had triumphed in the end. The newly built main hall of the Gandan was swarming once more with pilgrims and lamas. The recitation of the sacred Ganjuur sutra -- a practice that had been repressed in Mongolia for decades, the renewal of which I was there to witness -- was underway. Sitting in the coffee shop downstairs, in a building that was a teeming complex of ATMs, broadcast studios and what Munkhbaatar referred to as "donation receiving desks," akin to cashiers at a bank, for the performance of various religious services, he described Buddhism as never really lost "but preserved in the minds of people."
As a boy in the countryside in the 1980s, he recalled his grandfather -- a lama who disrobed after the execution of his teacher -- performing Buddhist rites under cover of darkness at an altar he kept hidden in his home behind a curtain. The other villagers, who praised Communist ideals of progress by day, would by night call on his grandfather, the disrobed lama, to perform healing rites. The Buddha outlined three freedoms, Munkhbaatar explained, of behavior, speech and mind: "The Communists controlled the first two, but they could not control our minds," he said.
On my penultimate night in Ulaanbaatar, I went to meet a woman named Gerelmaa, who went by Giimaa for short, for a shamanic ceremony. She lived in a ger neighborhood in a small house, with a yard full of rubble and rotting armchairs. A white Hyundai sat on cinder blocks, framed against the setting sun. Giimaa, a stout chain smoker in her 60s with a single upper tooth, had been an East German-trained electrical engineer under Communism before becoming a shaman in 1991. She'd often travel up to 5,000 miles a year on pilgrimages to Uvs Province in the west of the country to draw energy from the place where one of her ancestors, a powerful shaman in his day, had once lived. As we sat in an upstairs room full of taxidermy birds of prey, she told me that she mostly uses her shamanic powers to help people cure illnesses and dispel dark energy.
Giimaa donned her heavy reindeer-skin coat, hung with a bear's foot, a vulture's claw, a wolf's paw and brightly colored tassels. She made offerings of milk and vodka, which her spirit, like those of most people in Mongolia, seemed to relish. With a veil over her face and feathers on her head, she began to beat a pentagonal drum, dancing about the small room.
Once the spirit took hold, Giimaa slumped down on the floor and began to speak in the gravelly voice of her male ancestor. She had told me not to be scared, but it was scary. The spirit asked about my life, and I gave him the salient details: I was the love child of a Pakistani politician and an Indian journalist. My father had been assassinated by his own bodyguard. I was married to a man from Tennessee and had been unable to return to India to see my family since 2019, when Modi's government had stripped me of my overseas citizenship only months after I wrote an article critical of his re-election.
The spirit saw darkness in my life. He asked me to envision my home in the United States and, touching me, flew there to dispel that dark energy. My mind zoomed up, too, giving me an aerial view of this scene of a shamanic ceremony in a little house with the sun setting over the hills surrounding Ulaanbaatar. I thought of my fellow pilgrims: Eduardo Quintela, and his quiet tribute to his father; Aracely Alcón, full of gratitude for Santiago's restored mobility; and the woman at Erdene Zuu on her perilous journey.
Pilgrimage in that moment seemed less to me like exteriorized mysticism and more a rite of remembrance. The world would have us forget what is painful. It would have us move on and be free of the past; but both as individuals and societies, we have our loyalties to what we have known and endured. Pilgrimage gave us the illusion of a forward movement across space, even as it allowed an inner journey toward communion with our past. It was a crystallization of the poet Joseph Brodsky's idea that "if there is any substitute for love, it's memory."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: President Biden's signature climate law has stimulated a surge of investment in electric vehicle production across the country, including tens of billions of dollars on battery plants across the South and new assembly lines near the Great Lakes. Based on early evidence, it is succeeding at a goal that economists have long considered difficult and costly: using the power of government to rapidly grow a new industry.
That growth could prove crucial for the other side of the electric vehicle equation: enticing more consumers to buy them. That's because Mr. Biden's law effectively hitches the future affordability of electric vehicles to automakers' willingness to source and build them in the United States.
For now, the climate law has not drastically affected trends in electric vehicle sales. Americans are poised to buy one million electric cars and trucks for the first time this year, continuing a steady trend of increased market share for electric vehicles that began years ago.
The law's most pronounced immediate effect on the consumer market appears to be unintended: driving many electric car shoppers to lease vehicles instead of buying them. That's because a Treasury Department regulation enables auto dealers to avoid the law's made-in-America requirements for cars that they buy and then lease to customers. That allows shoppers to effectively reap the full benefits of the federal tax break for models that otherwise would not qualify.
Still, analysts say, electric vehicle sales are projected to jump sharply under the right conditions. Automakers would need to continue to invest in battery and assembly plants. Administration officials must speed the deployment of charging stations meant to ease the logistics of owning and driving an electric vehicle.
Mr. Biden is trying to jump-start the electric vehicle market as the global transition to cleaner fuels is accelerating more quickly than expected. That includes the switch to electric vehicles, which are a cornerstone of efforts to reduce emissions in the sector of the U.S. economy that emits the most greenhouse gases: transportation. Government policy missteps could slow or stall that growth.
The administration's policies to boost electric vehicles aren't just aimed at climate change. They also seek to support middle-class jobs for Americans in the auto industry. In a best-case scenario for the administration, those goals work together. The more automakers do to meet the made-in-America requirements in the climate law, the faster the electric vehicle industry will grow to dominate the U.S. auto market.
That relationship is primarily a function of cost. Without an American supply chain, electric vehicles can't qualify for the full $ 7,500 consumer tax credit the law created. Without the full credit, a typical electric vehicle remains less affordable than a conventional automobile. Those requirements don't apply to the leasing market, which explains the shift in consumer preferences.
"I think it's going to be a long time before you see your local waitress come in and buy an E.V. -- they're just too expensive," said Rhett Ricart, the chief executive and owner of the Ricart Automotive Group in Columbus, Ohio, and a former president of the National Automobile Dealers Association.
"If we're going to get people to buy these electric vehicles in volume," he said, "we will need more financial assistance from the manufacturers or the government."
Tax credits spur U.S. investment
The climate law spurred investment at a pivotal moment for American automakers. After a prolonged strike, union autoworkers won new concessions for workers who assemble electric vehicles and produce batteries at some plants that the three largest American carmakers run.
Republican leaders and some Wall Street analysts are calling on carmakers to abandon their plans and refocus on gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles. They claim the vehicle transition is effectively subsidizing China, which leads the world in electric-car technology and is home to vast stockpiles of critical minerals needed for batteries and other components.
The climate law's champions pitched it as a way to counter China and pull mining and manufacturing to the United States. That group included Senator Joe Manchin III, the West Virginia Democrat who cast the decisive vote for the bill and wielded outsize influence on its every detail.
Under the law, companies get lucrative tax credits for investing in electric vehicle production and component parts like advanced batteries. Consumers get up to $ 7,500 for buying an electric vehicle. But at Mr. Manchin's insistence, vehicles qualify for the credit only if they meet certain standards for how much of their content is made and mined in America, or in certain allied countries. Those standards get stricter every year.
Lobbyists from American auto companies warned that those requirements were so stringent that most electric vehicles -- other than Teslas -- would not qualify. Even Tesla vehicles could soon be excluded.
To avoid losing out, automakers have announced new battery projects across the country, particularly near Detroit and through the Southeast. They include plans from foreign automakers like Hyundai that were immediately excluded from the credit but want buyers to have access to it in the future.
"The response has happened faster than I think anyone would have anticipated on the supply side in anticipation of demand increasing," Wally Adeyemo, the deputy Treasury secretary, said in an interview. "I think the reason you're seeing these investments is that, ultimately, these companies see that over time, these credits are going to be quite effective in getting consumers to make a decision."
One area where companies have been slower to invest in the United States is in the raw materials and parts needed for batteries, including mines producing minerals like cobalt, and factories making chemicals that go into batteries. In the coming weeks, the Biden administration is expected to issue more rules about when these parts can be sourced from China and other countries, which are likely to determine where many companies base new projects.
Another proposed Biden regulation, from the Environmental Protection Agency, is encouraging automakers' investment in electric vehicle production. It seeks to ensure that two-thirds of all new passenger cars sold in the United States will be all-electric within a decade.
A Treasury rule encourages leasing
There is little evidence that the climate law has supercharged consumer demand for electric vehicles. American consumers bought about 873,000 electric vehicles in the first nine months of the year, according to Kelley Blue Book estimates. That put the country on a pace to surpass one million electric vehicle sales this year for the first time, but electric vehicles still account for not even one in 10 new cars and trucks sold in the United States.
The pace of that E.V. sales growth is actually slowing: Through the first nine months of 2022, Kelley Blue Book estimated, sales were up nearly 70 percent from the same period in 2021.
The climate law "certainly helped" with electric vehicle sales, said Mike Stanton, the president of the National Automobile Dealers Association. But, he said, "we were hoping for more."
The law has had a mixed effect for consumers and automakers. The federal government previously offered credits to electric car buyers but capped the total that individual automakers could qualify for. Both Tesla and General Motors, the nation's largest sellers of electric vehicles, exceeded that cap, meaning some consumers could not claim a credit for buying their cars.
The climate law restored credits for several of both companies' electric vehicles. It also eliminated credits for many of their competitors, like Hyundai and Kia, that assemble electric cars abroad. As of April, the number of vehicle models that qualify for the full credit had fallen by half compared with how many qualified before the climate law passed. G.M. and Tesla vehicles account for a majority of models that are still eligible for the full credit.
Elaine Buckberg, a former G.M. chief economist who is now a senior fellow at the Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability at Harvard, wrote in a research brief published in August that years of technological improvements and a consumer aversion to gasoline price spikes had helped electric vehicle sales grow even before the climate law passed.
After Mr. Biden signed the law, she wrote, "sales continued to trend up, with no abrupt shift."
Ms. Buckberg and other researchers, like Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, have noted one big way the law has changed the electric-vehicle market: It has pushed consumers toward leasing, not buying. That's because the Treasury Department allowed leased vehicles to be treated differently under the law's domestic content requirements. Companies like Hyundai and Kia are able to capture the full $ 7,500 credit for their electric models -- and pass that on to consumers -- if they lease them.
The auto dealers association calculates that more than half of electric vehicle transactions in the United States -- excluding Teslas, which are not sold through traditional dealership models -- are leased, a large jump from a year ago.
"For a dealer, that's easier for me," said Mr. Ricart, whose holdings in Columbus include a Hyundai dealership.
It is unclear how much the tax credit changes have otherwise influenced consumers' electric vehicle choices. Tesla's sales have grown by a quarter this year -- but on top of the tax credit re-qualification, it also slashed prices.
Auto dealers and administration officials are hopeful that a feature of the law that will take effect on Jan. 1 will further increase sales. It will allow qualified buyers to immediately pass their electric vehicle credit on to a dealer, essentially using it as a down payment, instead of waiting until they file a tax return to receive money back.
Chargers remain a critical part of the equation
Two years after Congress passed a law that included $ 5 billion to install fast chargers at 50-mile intervals along major highways, only a handful of states have awarded contracts to construct stations. Chargers remain relatively scarce on most highways.
Spotty availability of fast chargers is shaping up as one of the main reasons that people hesitate to buy electric vehicles. Most owners charge at home. But on longer voyages, they need chargers capable of charging a car in half an hour to 45 minutes.
Kara Womack, an Atlanta resident, owns a Hyundai electric car but is thinking of trading it in for a hybrid because it's too difficult to drive to visit family in Nashville.
"I don't know if I'm going to be able to find enough chargers to make it," said Ms. Womack, vice president of product at ParkMobile, which advises parking lot operators on where to place chargers. "If you've got an E.V. and you can't take it on a road trip because you can't count on the infrastructure, then it's a challenge."
Last month, modeling that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released predicted that the combination of vehicles qualifying for the consumer tax credits and the eventual build-out of the charging network under the infrastructure law would help electric vehicles make up 42 percent of all vehicles sold in America in less than a decade. That would be more than quadruple today's market share for plug-ins, and significantly higher than the result if Mr. Biden had done nothing to bolster the industry, according to the agency's study.
Billions of private investment dollars could help speed up expanding the charging network. Operators of roadside travel service centers, like Circle K, Pilot Flying J and Sheetz, are installing chargers alongside gas pumps. Carmakers, including G.M. and Mercedes-Benz, are building charging stations. Next year, much of Tesla's charging network -- the largest in the United States -- will open to other vehicles as part of an agreement with Ford, G.M. and other carmakers.
"The states are now rolling and making a lot of progress," said Andrew Dick, business development manager for Electrify America, a charging company. He added, "Things are starting to move very quickly."

Carmakers Downshift on E.V. Spending as Sales Growth Slows: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Growth is brisk but slower than expected, causing automakers to question their multibillion-dollar investments in new factories and raising doubts about the effectiveness of federal incentives.
Normally a 50 percent increase in sales is considered very good. But when the number of electric vehicles sold in the United States grew that much during the third quarter from a year earlier, it was a disappointment.
Carmakers and analysts had expected more. Instead of celebrating, auto executives worried that demand for electric vehicles was slackening, raising questions about their plans to invest tens of billions of dollars to develop new models and build factories.
In recent weeks, General Motors, Ford Motor and Tesla cited slower sales and signs that the economy was weakening in announcing that they would delay that spending. That was a blow to the Biden administration's plan to fight climate change by promoting zero-emission vehicles, and it cast doubt on whether generous federal tax credits for electric car buyers were working as well as policymakers had hoped.
"Our commitment to an all-E.V. future is as strong as ever," Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of G.M., told analysts on a conference call last month. But, she added, the market is turning out to be "a bit bumpy." As a result, G.M. is waiting several months to begin selling some new electric models, including a battery-powered incarnation of the Chevrolet Equinox sport utility vehicle.
Ford and G.M. have staked billions to retool factories and build new ones to produce electric vehicles, batteries and other components. If the carmakers have miscalculated, the consequences could be severe. (Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram, has not yet begun selling any all-electric vehicles in the United States.)
Sales of electric vehicles in China and Europe are also growing more slowly than they were a few months ago.
Still, electric vehicle sales are growing faster than any other major category of automobile, and Americans will buy more than one million of them this year, a record. From July through September, battery-powered cars accounted for 8 percent of the new cars sold in the United States, up from 6 percent a year earlier, according to Cox Automotive.
But some once-hot models are selling more slowly. Sales of the Ford Mustang Mach-E, which commanded a stiff markup a year ago, slumped 10 percent in October from a year earlier, Ford said last week.
"E.V.s are still in high demand," Jim Farley, Ford's chief executive, told analysts. But he added that increased competition had pushed down prices.
Carmakers have introduced at least 14 new all-electric models in the last year, according to Cox, and stepped up production of other models that had been in short supply. Inevitably, some sell better than others.
"The demand is inching up, but it's not moving up nearly to the degree that supply and production is increasing," said Rob Cochran, chief executive of #1 Cochran Automotive, which owns 34 dealerships in Pennsylvania and Ohio that sell nearly all major brands, including Ford, Chevrolet, Hyundai and Volkswagen.
Even Tesla -- which dominates the electric car market, with about half of all sales in the most recent quarter -- has struggled to sell cars and had to cut prices by thousands of dollars.
Some conservatives have seized on recent data to argue that electric vehicles are overhyped. Republicans like Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio have claimed electric vehicles are destroying auto industry jobs, and have proposed rolling back policies designed to encourage people to buy battery-powered cars.
A political agenda is driving some of those proclaiming an end to the electric vehicle boom, said Albert Gore III, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, an industry group whose members include carmakers like Tesla and Rivian, charging companies like EVgo and ChargePoint, and suppliers of equipment and raw materials.
"There are a lot of folks eager to draw a conclusion we should be less aggressive with policy," Mr. Gore said.
Some analysts said the uneven growth was not surprising as electric vehicles go from being a niche product to a more mass market offering. Most car owners are still learning about the technology, and carmakers and dealers are figuring out how best to sell to them.
"We had a lot of early adopters buy expensive electric vehicles," said Tom Narayan, global autos analyst at RBC Capital Markets. "Now you're at the point where the Main Street consumer is looking at E.V.s."
Ford illustrates the mixed signals that sales figures are sending. While sales of the Mach-E were up just 1.5 percent in the first 10 months of the year, sales of the F-150 Lightning, a battery-powered pickup, surged 43 percent. All told, sales of Ford electric vehicles rose 13 percent from January through October while sales of cars and trucks with internal combustion engines were up 7 percent. Sales of hybrid vehicles, which combine electric propulsion with internal combustion engines, climbed 19 percent.
The weak Mach-E sales probably reflect competition from the Tesla Model Y more than any broader trend, analysts said. Many buyers might be comparing the two vehicles, which are of a similar size and style. Tesla has cut the price of the Model Y so that the least expensive model is $ 2,500 less than the Ford after federal tax credits are applied.
The end of the United Automobile Workers' recent strikes against Ford, G.M. and Stellantis has refocused attention on traditional carmakers' attempts to compete with Tesla.
Electric vehicles played an important role in the U.A.W. negotiations, and tentative contract agreements extend at least some union privileges to workers at new battery factories. But the deals will increase manufacturing costs and make it that much harder for Ford, G.M. and Stellantis to catch up to Tesla, which is not unionized.
Buyers remain interested in electric vehicles, surveys show, but struggle to afford them. The average price paid for an electric vehicle in the United States was less than $ 51,000 in September, according to Cox Automotive. That's a huge decline from last year's $ 65,000. But it's still too high for many new-car buyers, especially as high interest rates have made monthly car payments more expensive. The average rate on a car loan is more than 8 percent, according to Federal Reserve data, compared with less than 5 percent in early 2022.
In the last few years, carmakers flooded the market with S.U.V.s aimed at affluent suburban homeowners. And there is still a dearth of cars priced below $ 30,000 that middle-class buyers can afford.
"A lot of automakers were rushing vehicles into the market," said Kevin Roberts, director of industry insights and analytics at CarGurus, an online car marketplace. "Now they're running into a situation in a rising interest rate environment that they are not priced properly."
Some would-be electric vehicle buyers may also be worried about finding enough places to quickly charge cars on road trips. After price, charging infrastructure is the No. 1 thing people worry about when considering an E.V., many surveys conclude.
Public charging is also essential for anyone who lives in an apartment or can't install a home charger, a group that skews young. "The younger demographic is more open to electric vehicles than the older demographic," Mr. Cochran, the Ohio and Pennsylvania dealer, said. "Typically it's the younger demographic that's in apartment settings. The fact that the infrastructure is not built up is a deterrent."
At least two of Mr. Cochran's customers returned newly purchased electric vehicles after discovering there weren't enough chargers near their homes, he said.
For people interested in buying an electric vehicle, the good news is that prices are likely to continue falling as carmakers ramp up new factories. Starting in January, dealers will be able to apply federal tax credits of up to $ 7,500 when a customer buys a car. Previously, buyers had to wait until they filed their taxes to claim the credit.
The charging system is also improving, albeit slowly. Parts of Tesla's network of fast chargers, the largest in the United States, will open to Ford, G.M. and other brands next year. Other carmakers are building their own chargers. Mercedes-Benz said last week that it would install at least 55 stations at high-end shopping malls in the United States and Canada operated by Simon Property Group, a large real estate firm.
Carmakers have gotten the message that selling electric vehicles is different from selling gasoline cars. "Charging," said Andrew Cornelia, chief executive of Mercedes's high-power charging unit in North America, "is still a critical problem to solve."

A New Law Supercharged Electric Car Manufacturing, but Not Sales

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden’s signature climate law has stimulated a surge of investment in electric vehicle production across the country, including tens of billions of dollars on battery plants across the South and new assembly lines near the Great Lakes. Based on early evidence, it is succeeding at a goal that economists have long considered difficult and costly: using the power of government to rapidly grow a new industry.
That growth could prove crucial for the other side of the electric vehicle equation: enticing more consumers to buy them. That’s because Biden’s law effectively hitches the future affordability of electric vehicles to automakers’ willingness to source and build them in the United States.
For now, the climate law has not drastically affected trends in electric vehicle sales. Americans are poised to buy 1 million electric cars and trucks for the first time this year, continuing a steady trend of increased market share for electric vehicles that began years ago.
The law’s most pronounced immediate effect on the consumer market appears to be unintended: driving many electric car shoppers to lease vehicles instead of buying them. That’s because a Treasury Department regulation enables auto dealers to avoid the law’s made-in-America requirements for cars that they buy and then lease to customers.

Billions of private investment dollars could help speed up expanding the charging network. Operators of roadside travel service centers, such as Circle K, Pilot Flying J and Sheetz, are installing chargers alongside gas pumps. Carmakers, including GM and Mercedes-Benz, are building charging stations. Next year, much of Tesla’s charging network — the largest in the United States — will open to other vehicles as part of an agreement with Ford, GM and other carmakers.
“The states are now rolling and making a lot of progress,” said Andrew Dick, business development manager for Electrify America, a charging company. He added, “Things are starting to move very quickly.”

SOUTH BURLINGTON, Vt. — The four vehicles parked at a depot in South Burlington, Vermont, look no different from the yellow school buses familiar to millions of schoolchildren. But beneath their steel shells, these buses are packed with technology that could be vital in the transition to clean energy.
While their main job remains transporting children, the vehicles take on a second task while sitting idle during school hours. The local utility puts their batteries to work, storing excess renewable energy so it can be pumped back into the grid when needed.
The buses are a test of the idea that electric vehicles, which skeptics often see as an expensive burden that could bring down electric grids, could be just the opposite: a buffer that soaks up power when there is too much and provides it when demand for electricity surges.
Any suitably equipped electric vehicle can be used to store surplus electricity, avoiding the need for utilities to fire up gas-fueled power plants when there isn’t enough sun or wind. But school buses work especially well because they have big batteries and spend much of the day parked.
“There’s no better tool than an electric school bus fleet to sort of smooth those curves,” said Duncan McIntyre, the CEO of Highland Fleets, a company near Boston that provides the buses and equipment. Synop, a New York firm, provides the software to manage the interaction between vehicles, chargers and the grid.
Utilities across the country have been testing the ability of batteries in electric vehicles to help stabilize increasingly unreliable power plants and lines that have faltered under stress from hurricanes, heat waves and other extreme weather linked to climate change.
Grueling summer heat this year tested the Texas grid for weeks, forcing officials to plead with homeowners and businesses to use less energy so the state could avoid rolling blackouts or the kind of power failure that left millions of people without light or heat in 2021.
Some energy experts say one solution to these problems is to corral thousands of rooftop solar panels, home batteries and electric vehicles around a city or state into virtual power plants. Tethered together with the help of software, the collective capacity of such devices to generate and store energy can be more than enough to avoid a blackout when power plants falter or strong winds take down a transmission line.
Grids primarily use power plants with quick-start abilities, known as peaking units, to serve as backup sources of energy. But such plants typically use gas, a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, and are expensive to run and maintain. Many have also failed to perform when they are most needed.
Electric school buses, in particular, could be very useful to the grid because of their limited use during school days and broad availability during summer’s sweltering temperatures.
Schools in every state except Wyoming have committed to begin using electric buses, though the number on the roads is small at fewer than 3,000 as of June 30, according the World Resources Institute, a nonprofit that works on the energy, environment and related issues.
California’s total number of school buses leads the nation, and Montgomery County, Maryland, has more than any other school district.
“We’re on the edge of the technology, which doesn’t happen often for school buses,” said Daoud Chaaya, vice president of sales for Thomas Built, a unit of the truck maker Daimler that supplied South Burlington’s electric buses.
The World Resources Institute is pushing U.S. policymakers to make sure all school buses are battery-powered by 2030, a goal that would also reduce asthma and other diseases in children by eliminating pollution from combustion-engine buses.
“There’s definitely a lot of challenges,” said Sue Gander, director of the institute’s electric school bus initiative. “It’s going to take some time for everybody to get there.”
Cost remains a big hurdle: An electric school bus can cost three times as much as a $100,000 diesel bus. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, passed in 2021, allocated $5 billion over five years to help schools buy electric buses, and the price is expected to fall in coming years. In the meantime, school districts can defray their expenses by letting utilities use buses to store energy.
In South Burlington, the school district leases the electric buses from Highland, which also supplies equipment to recharge them and pays the electricity bills. Those bills are lower than normal because of a deal that lets Green Mountain Power, the utility serving most of Vermont, draw power from the bus batteries when demand surges. They are part of a network that also includes batteries that homeowners install to provide backup power during blackouts.
In total, Green Mountain Power has access to 50 megawatts of battery storage from school buses, home batteries and other sources, said Mari McClure, the utility’s CEO. That’s as much as a small gas power plant. Unlike a plant that runs on fossil fuels, the power is available almost instantly.
The utility asked Vermont regulators last month to allow it to install batteries at the homes of its customers who don’t already have one, an effort that would dovetail with its work on school buses.
Over time, McClure said, enough electric school buses and home batteries may be connected to the grid to stop her utility from needing to buy electricity from out-of-state power plants. Commercial vans, pickups and garbage trucks could join the network as more businesses and cities buy electric vehicles.
But linking these vehicle batteries to the grid will take not only time but also money. While a standard electric vehicle charger for buses can cost $3,000 to $7,000 to install, initial data from early demonstrations of electric pickups indicates that equipment needed to send power back to the grid ranges from $10,000 to $58,000, according to the Electric Power Research Institute, an independent nonprofit organization. Utilities may also need to upgrade their power lines, transformers and other equipment.
There are also difficult legal and financial issues to sort out. Many states have struggled to determine how to compensate homeowners and businesses for power they deliver to the electric grid from batteries and rooftop solar panels.
Energy experts said that such issues would get addressed and that the high costs of electric vehicles would come down as utilities, regulators and manufacturers gained more experience.
Vehicle batteries can meet some of the needs of customers, utilities and the wholesale market for electricity, said Daniel Bowermaster, senior program manager for electric transportation at the Electric Power Research Institute. “From the technological standpoint, those things are within the realm of possibility.”
Officials in South Burlington, whose diesel bus fleet is mostly paid off, said they were willing to spend more on electric buses. The new buses are much better for the environment and public health, said Tim Jarvis, the school district’s finance manager.
There are other benefits, too.
Sean McKenzie, transportation coordinator for South Burlington schools, who drives a bus because of a labor shortage, said children no longer had to shout above the roar of a diesel engine.
“I was surprised that they were quieter,” he said.

U.A.W. Gains May Have Set New Bar for Unions: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Experts said the union's new contracts could set precedents that give labor advantages when bargaining contracts and organizing workers.
Laying out a tentative contract agreement to end a six-week wave of walkouts at Ford Motor, the United Automobile Workers president made an unusual pitch to other labor unions.
"We invite unions around the country to align your contract expirations with our own," the U.A.W. leader, Shawn Fain, said Sunday night.
"If we're going to truly take on the billionaire class and rebuild the economy so that it starts to work for the benefit of the many and not the few," Mr. Fain added, "then it's important that we not only strike, but that we strike together."
While it remains to be seen whether other unions follow the U.A.W.'s lead, Mr. Fain's invitation highlights the sweeping ambition of the union's strategy during the recent strike, the first to target all three Detroit automakers simultaneously.
Beyond seeking the largest wage and benefit increases in decades -- and a reversal of the concessions the union made during the companies' downturn, such as lower wage tiers for newer workers -- Mr. Fain repeatedly spoke of fighting for "the entire working class."
Labor experts said the proposals that union negotiators agreed to with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent of Jeep, Ram and Chrysler, had produced gains that could in fact reverberate well beyond the workers that the union represented.
"It is a historic and transformative victory by the U.A.W.," said Nelson Lichtenstein, a labor historian at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
Dr. Lichtenstein said that winning substantial gains through a strike in a critical industry demonstrated the benefits of work stoppages after decades in which workers had been taught to regard strikes warily.
"Fain says: 'Hey, strikes work, solidarity works; we're more unified now than before the strike,"' he added. "I think that's a powerful argument unions can take elsewhere."
Even before the strike ended, unions at other companies appeared to be doing just that.
In an interview in late September, David Pryzbylski, a lawyer who represents employers, said union officials in two separate contract negotiations had invoked the U.A.W. when discussing the possibility of a strike. "Outside the U.A.W., it's putting wind in their sails," Mr. Pryzbylski said. "They may be blustering, but I am seeing it already trickle down."
A recent report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce raised concerns that an emboldened labor movement was increasing strike activity and "causing collateral damage to a host of local businesses and communities" by harming the economic ecosystem that depended on automakers and other employers.
The element of strategy that the U.A.W. brought to its strike may also prove instructive to other workers and unions. Rather than ask all employees to strike at once, the union started small, with one key plant at each of the Big Three, then ramped up as it sought to bring additional pressure. The U.A.W. refrained from expanding the strike when it felt a company was bargaining productively, and it expanded to a highly valuable plant when it felt a company was dragging its feet -- in both cases, to create an incentive for the companies to engage with the union.
The approach may not translate perfectly to other industries, such as retail and hospitality, that are harder to disrupt with the loss of a small number of locations. But Peter Olney, a former organizing director with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, said the strategy was more widely applicable than it might appear at first glance.
He cited the possibility of organizing and striking at coffee bean roasting plants and distribution centers for a company like Starbucks, where workers at hundreds of retail stores in the United States have organized over the past few years. "They have 9,000 locations, there's a lot of redundancy and replication," Mr. Olney said, referring to company-owned stores in the United States. "But there are some choke points in that system, too."
And it is difficult for service-sector industries to send operations offshore in response to labor unrest, because proximity to customers is critical. By contrast, the U.A.W. may have to contend with the risk that companies shift production to Mexico as labor costs increase.
"That's where the international solidarity aspect of it comes in -- the need to build up a cross-border network with Mexico," Mr. Olney said. Last year, workers at a large G.M. plant in the country voted out a union accused of colluding with management in favor of an independent union.
In some ways, the recent U.A.W. effort builds on the gains made by unions involved in other high-profile standoffs. To resolve a nearly five-month strike with Hollywood writers in September, major studios agreed to a set of restrictions on the use of artificial intelligence. The agreement was a break with employers' typical insistence that management should have control over technology and investment decisions.
The tentative U.A.W. contracts award the union more influence over such decision-making as well -- for example, by allowing workers to strike against the entire company over the threat of a plant shutdown before their contract has expired. The union also successfully pressed Stellantis to reopen an Illinois plant that the company had closed.
Mr. Pryzbylski, the management-side lawyer, said that while such strike provisions and plant reopenings are not unheard of, they are uncommon.
Dr. Lichtenstein said securing these gains in such a high-profile context could prompt employees at other companies to demand a say in decisions that their employers had typically characterized as management prerogatives. "It restores a kind of social and political character to investment decisions," he said. "It's something the left has wanted for over a century."
In other cases, the U.A.W. managed to extract concessions at plants where it doesn't yet represent workers -- another unusual win that could be mimicked by fellow unions. Ford agreed that U.A.W. members would be allowed to transfer into battery and electric vehicles plants under construction in Michigan and Tennessee, and that these plants would fall under the union's national contract if the workers unionized there. According to the U.A.W., that would happen without the need to hold a union election at either site.
Madeline Janis, co-executive director of Jobs to Move America, a group that seeks to create good jobs in clean technology industries, called these arrangements a "huge historic, unprecedented deal" for helping to ensure that the E.V. transition benefited workers.
U.A.W. officials say that adding new members is critical to the union's survival, and that the Big Three contracts will provide a major boost to these efforts because organizers can point to large concrete benefits of unionizing.
"We're not going to win a contract victory this big in the future if we're not able to start organizing, especially in the E.V. sector," said Mike Miller, a U.A.W. regional director in the Western United States. "It has to involve Tesla, Volkswagen and Hyundai."
But some experts said the momentum of the recent contracts could help organizing campaigns that were even further afield. "It's not just personal vehicle manufacturing -- it's the fleets of delivery vans, big electric buses and trains," said Erica Smiley, executive director of Jobs With Justice, which helps workers seeking to unionize and bargain collectively.
Ms. Smiley noted that many of these companies, just like electric vehicle manufacturers, had received public subsidies, creating an opportunity for organizers to appeal to politicians for help raising pay and improving benefits so that they more closely resembled what the U.A.W. just won.
"The administration is investing in these industries," she added. "The question is how to use this to raise the floor."

Union Victories May Also Lift Biden Politically: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: President Biden's support for autoworkers helped them make big wage gains, and labor organizers are looking to bring about similar gains elsewhere as carmakers transition to electric vehicles.
The United Automobile Workers' big wins with Detroit's Big Three automakers could also prove to be a significant political victory for President Biden, who openly sided with striking workers to pressure the companies, General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, to produce generous concessions.
But the U.A.W.'s turn now toward nonunionized automakers like Tesla, Hyundai, BMW and Mercedes will test whether Mr. Biden's support, as well as measures that he signed into law, will produce the expansion of organized labor that he has long promised.
For unionized autoworkers, many of them in the swing state of Michigan, the tentative contracts, which are awaiting rank-and-file ratification, would bring substantial wage gains, "another piece of good economic news," Mr. Biden said on Monday. The tentative contracts would lift the top U.A.W. wage to more than $ 40 per hour over four and a half years, from $ 32 an hour. Stellantis, maker of Chryslers, Jeeps and Ram trucks, agreed to reopen its assembly plant in Belvidere, Ill., near the border of Wisconsin, another crucial swing state.
"The impact of Biden's public support can't be overstated," said Steve Smith, a spokesman for the umbrella A.F.L.-C.I.O., which includes the autoworkers' union. "There's a lot of upside here for Biden. The contracts set a new standard for the industry that clearly show the benefit of collective bargaining."
Beyond that, G.M. agreed to bring its electric vehicle battery joint venture, Ultium, under the national contract, a boon for Ultium workers but also a pressure point for unions as they seek to organize battery plants sprouting up around the country. Such plants are using generous subsidies from Mr. Biden's signature legislative achievements -- especially the climate change provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act -- as the administration pushes to speed the country's transition to electric vehicles.
"This historic contract is a testament to the power of unions and collective bargaining to build strong middle-class jobs while helping our most iconic American companies thrive," Mr. Biden said Monday evening.
Jason Walsh, the executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, which has brought together labor and environmental groups to marshal support for the clean energy transition, said the contracts, if ratified by U.A.W. workers, would be a watershed moment for the economy -- and possibly the planet.
"The legislative intent behind the industrial policy in the Inflation Reduction Act was an implicit deal: We as a nation are going to invest in the sectors of the economy that are important to the country and the planet in the long run, but in return we want the companies that receive those benefits to maximize returns to workers, communities and the environment," Mr. Walsh said. To that end, the contract settlement is "huge," he added. "It highlights the lie peddled by Donald Trump and at times the Big Three that the E.V. transition means lower-quality jobs in a nonunion work force."
The U.A.W. actions took on strikingly political meaning. In May, the autoworkers' union opted to withhold an endorsement of Mr. Biden's re-election, openly expressing "our concerns with the electric vehicle transition" that the president was pushing through legislation and regulation.
Last month, Mr. Biden became the first sitting U.S. president to join a picket line. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, castigated striking workers, saying "they want more money working fewer hours. They want more benefits working fewer days."
Mr. Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, visited a nonunion parts plant in Michigan to rail against electric vehicles and to demand that Shawn Fain, the new and aggressive U.A.W. president, endorse him for another term in the White House.
Mr. Fain said he would never do that, and supporters of the president pointed to provisions in federal laws championed by Mr. Biden that may have helped secure the deals. Subsidies for electric vehicle production will go only to domestic manufacturing plants, meaning Detroit management could not credibly threaten to move new auto plants overseas in search of cheaper labor.
But union officials did not say on Monday what their intentions were for a presidential endorsement. Mr. Fain did make clear over the weekend that he was not resting on his laurels with the gains achieved with its escalating wave of strikes against the Big Three. The union plans to target Tesla, the nonunion automaker that dominates the domestic electric vehicle market, as well as foreign automakers with factories in the Southeast, where unions have struggled to gain a foothold. Some of the biggest new plants are under construction in Georgia, a critical swing state for 2024, including a Hyundai electric vehicle plant that will be the state's biggest economic development project ever.
Organizers will be able to lean on provisions of the three big laws that Mr. Biden signed -- a $ 1 trillion infrastructure bill, a $ 280 billion measure to rekindle a domestic semiconductor industry and the Inflation Reduction Act, which included $ 370 billion for clean energy to combat climate change -- to push their case.
Tucked into all of those laws were measures to give unions the power to effectively tell employers that accept rich federal tax incentives this: You must pay union-scale wages and use union apprenticeship and training programs, so you might as well hire union workers.
How electric vehicle and battery makers respond to the U.A.W.'s next push will go a long way toward determining whether Mr. Biden can make good on his promise that his effort to curtail climate change and wean the nation off fossil fuels will indeed produce "good union jobs."

Beyond seeking the largest wage and benefit increases in decades — and a reversal of the concessions the union made during the companies’ downturn, such as lower wage tiers for newer workers — Fain repeatedly spoke of fighting for “the entire working class.”
Labor experts said the proposals that union negotiators agreed to with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent of Jeep, Ram and Chrysler, had produced gains that could in fact reverberate well beyond the workers that the union represented.
“It is a historic and transformative victory by the UAW,” said Nelson Lichtenstein, a labor historian at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
Lichtenstein said that winning substantial gains through a strike in a critical industry demonstrated the benefits of work stoppages after decades in which workers had been taught to regard strikes warily.
“Fain says: ‘Hey, strikes work, solidarity works; we’re more unified now than before the strike,’” he added. “I think that’s a powerful argument unions can take elsewhere.”
Even before the strike ended, unions at other companies appeared to be doing just that.
In an interview in late September, David Pryzbylski, a lawyer who represents employers, said union officials in two separate contract negotiations had invoked the UAW when discussing the possibility of a strike. “Outside the UAW, it’s putting wind in their sails,” Pryzbylski said. “They may be blustering, but I am seeing it already trickle down.”
A recent report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce raised concerns that an emboldened labor movement was increasing strike activity and “causing collateral damage to a host of local businesses and communities” by harming the economic ecosystem that depended on automakers and other employers.
The element of strategy that the UAW brought to its strike may also prove instructive to other workers and unions. Rather than ask all employees to strike at once, the union started small, with one key plant at each of the Big Three, then ramped up as it sought to bring additional pressure. The UAW refrained from expanding the strike when it felt a company was bargaining productively, and it expanded to a highly valuable plant when it felt a company was dragging its feet — in both cases, to create an incentive for the companies to engage with the union.
The approach may not translate perfectly to other industries, such as retail and hospitality, that are harder to disrupt with the loss of a small number of locations. But Peter Olney, a former organizing director with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, said the strategy was more widely applicable than it might appear at first glance.
He cited the possibility of organizing and striking at coffee bean roasting plants and distribution centers for a company such as Starbucks, where workers at hundreds of retail stores in the United States have organized over the past few years. “They have 9,000 locations, there’s a lot of redundancy and replication,” Olney said, referring to company-owned stores in the United States. “But there are some choke points in that system, too.”
And it is difficult for service-sector industries to send operations offshore in response to labor unrest, because proximity to customers is critical. By contrast, the UAW may have to contend with the risk that companies shift production to Mexico as labor costs increase.
“That’s where the international solidarity aspect of it comes in — the need to build up a cross-border network with Mexico,” Olney said. Last year, workers at a large GM plant in the country voted out a union accused of colluding with management in favor of an independent union.
In some ways, the recent UAW effort builds on the gains made by unions involved in other high-profile standoffs. To resolve a nearly five-month strike with Hollywood writers in September, major studios agreed to a set of restrictions on the use of artificial intelligence. The agreement was a break with employers’ typical insistence that management should have control over technology and investment decisions.
The tentative UAW contracts award the union more influence over such decision-making as well — for example, by allowing workers to strike against the entire company over the threat of a plant shutdown before their contract has expired. The union also successfully pressed Stellantis to reopen an Illinois plant that the company had closed.
Pryzbylski, the management-side lawyer, said that while such strike provisions and plant reopenings are not unheard of, they are uncommon.
Lichtenstein said securing these gains in such a high-profile context could prompt employees at other companies to demand a say in decisions that their employers had typically characterized as management prerogatives. “It restores a kind of social and political character to investment decisions,” he said. “It’s something the left has wanted for over a century.”
In other cases, the UAW managed to extract concessions at plants where it doesn’t yet represent workers — another unusual win that could be mimicked by fellow unions. Ford agreed that UAW members would be allowed to transfer into battery and electric vehicles plants under construction in Michigan and Tennessee, and that these plants would fall under the union’s national contract if the workers unionized there. According to the UAW, that would happen without the need to hold a union election at either site.
Madeline Janis, co-executive director of Jobs to Move America, a group that seeks to create good jobs in clean technology industries, called these arrangements a “huge historic, unprecedented deal” for helping to ensure that the EV transition benefited workers.
UAW officials say that adding new members is critical to the union’s survival, and that the Big Three contracts will provide a major boost to these efforts because organizers can point to large concrete benefits of unionizing.
“We’re not going to win a contract victory this big in the future if we’re not able to start organizing, especially in the EV sector,” said Mike Miller, a UAW regional director in the Western United States. “It has to involve Tesla, Volkswagen and Hyundai.”
But some experts said the momentum of the recent contracts could help organizing campaigns that were even further afield. “It’s not just personal vehicle manufacturing — it’s the fleets of delivery vans, big electric buses and trains,” said Erica Smiley, executive director of Jobs With Justice, which helps workers seeking to unionize and bargain collectively.
Smiley noted that many of these companies, just like electric vehicle manufacturers, had received public subsidies, creating an opportunity for organizers to appeal to politicians for help raising pay and improving benefits so that they more closely resembled what the UAW just won.
“The administration is investing in these industries,” she added. “The question is how to use this to raise the floor.”

Full text: A tentative agreement gives union members at the carmaker their best terms in decades but could complicate Ford's electric vehicle plans.
When autoworkers went on strike in September, executives of the large U.S. automakers warned that union demands could significantly undermine their ability to compete in a fast-changing industry. The chief executive of Ford Motor said that the company might have to scrap its investment in electric vehicles.
The future doesn't look quite that bleak now that Ford and the United Automobile Workers union have reached a tentative agreement that is likely to serve as a template for deals the union eventually reaches with General Motors and Stellantis, the maker of Ram, Jeep and Chrysler.
Ford's costs will rise under the terms of the new contract, which includes a 25 percent raise over four and a half years, improved retirement benefits and other provisions. The extra expense will weigh on profit and could hamper Ford's ability to invest in new technology, John Lawler, the company's chief financial officer, said Thursday.
But some analysts said the increases should be manageable. What will matter more for the company's prospects, they said, is how innovative and efficient the company is in designing and producing cars and technology that can compete with offerings from Tesla, which dominates electric vehicles, the auto industry's fastest growing segment.
"They haven't agreed to anything that will kill their competitiveness," said Joshua Murray, an associate professor at Vanderbilt University who is an author of a book that examined how U.S. automakers lost ground to Japanese and European rivals. He said the deal could even help Ford, in part because the four-year contract ensures there would be no labor strife during an intense phase of the transition to electric vehicles.
"They won't be engaged in labor conflict while they're dealing with" the technology shift, Mr. Murray said.
Ford said on Thursday that it earned $ 1.2 billion from July through September on revenue of $ 44 billion; the company lost $ 827 million in the third quarter of 2022. But the division that makes electric vehicles lost $ 1.3 billion because of investments in new technology and increasing competition that has pushed down prices.
The roughly 17,000 Ford workers who had been on strike, out of a total of 57,000 U.A.W. employees at the company, are expected to begin returning to factories soon. At U.A.W. Local 900 in Wayne, Mich., across the street from a Ford plant that was one of the first three factories to be struck by the U.A.W., workers were disposing of signs, firewood and bottled water that had been stockpiled for picket lines.
"This is the best contract I have seen in my 30 years with Ford," said Robert Carter, 49, who works with engineers to lay out work stations on the assembly line. He said younger workers who had been earning well below the top wage of $ 32 an hour would see the biggest impact with the new contract; their pay would rise to more than $ 40 an hour over the next four and a half years.
"For some people, their pay is going to almost double," he said. "How can you say that's not huge?"
The reaction on Wall Street suggested that investors did not regard the agreement as a catastrophe. The carmaker's shares fell 1.7 percent during regular trading on Thursday.
But Ford stock slumped almost 5 percent in after-hours trading after the company said that, because of the cost of the strike, it could no longer stand by an earlier estimate that profit before interest expenses and taxes would be $ 11 billion to $ 12 billion in 2023. Mr. Lawler also said that strike would cost the company $ 1.3 billion this year.
Analysts at Barclays estimated the annual cost of pay raises, improved retirement benefits and other measures in the new union contract to be $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion annually by the end of the four-year contract period, or equivalent to about 1 percent of sales.
Mr. Lawler said on a conference call that the contract would raise the company's labor costs by an average of $ 850 to $ 900 per vehicle. He said Ford would try to "identify efficiencies and improve productivity to help us deliver on our targets" in light of those higher labor costs.
Some analysts were critical of the deal with the U.A.W., saying the cost to Ford could put it at a significant disadvantage, perhaps prompting the company to move more production to Mexico.
"It adds a constraint in a very competitive market," said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive. "It's definitely a compromise that, I think, down the road will either limit Ford's performance or force them to consider alternatives."
During the contentious negotiations, Ford complained that a big raise for workers would put it even further behind Tesla in the electric vehicle market. Sales of Ford's two main battery-powered models, the F-150 Lightning truck and the Mustang Mach-E sport-utility vehicle, have been disappointing this year, and the company recently scaled back plans to increase production of the Lightning.
"There is tremendous downward pressure on E.V. pricing," Mr. Lawler said.
But Tesla and other automakers like Toyota, Hyundai, Nissan and Honda, whose factories in the United States do not have unions, may now face pressure to raise wages, eroding any cost advantage they might have had.
The U.A.W. has declared its intention to try to organize those factories. The pay agreement with Ford, by far the biggest boost in compensation that the union has won in decades, is likely to serve as a powerful advertisement for collective bargaining.
"Elon Musk better be looking at this," said Madeline Janis, executive director of Jobs to Move America, an advocacy group that has close ties to organized labor. "Hyundai and Toyota better be looking at this. This is a new era where workers are standing up."
Tesla, the company Mr. Musk runs, and other carmakers that don't have union workers in the United States, like BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, may decide to pre-emptively hand out raises to keep labor organizers at bay.
"One strategy to deter union organizing is to raise wages," said Rebecca Kolins Givan, an associate professor of labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers University.
The decisive factor in the electric vehicle market will be the ability of Ford, G.M. and Stellantis to produce innovative products, Ms. Givan and others said. That is the responsibility of management, not assembly line workers.
"It's clear that these companies have work to do in the electric vehicle market," Ms. Givan said. "There is nothing in this contract that creates any constraints."
In addition to the 25 percent pay increase, the contract gives Ford's hourly workers cost-of-living wage adjustments, major gains on pensions and job security, and the right to strike over plant closings. The union had initially asked for a 40 percent wage increase.
Ford has not yet set dates for restarting plants idled by the strike. The company previously said it could take up to four weeks to reach full production. Ford also needs some 600 suppliers to resume production and to deliver parts.
"Bringing a plant back up is much more difficult than taking it down," Bryce Currie, vice president of Americas manufacturing at Ford, said this month.
Workers at the Wayne plant, which makes the Ranger pickup and the Bronco sport-utility vehicle, had not received return-to-work orders on Thursday, but they expected to be back on the assembly line next week.
Walter Robinson, 57, has worked at the Wayne plant for 34 years and expects to retire by the end of the new contract. But he said three of his children work for Ford and would see a big benefit from the new terms.
"My daughter has only been here two years, and it was going to take years for her to get the top wage," he said. "This is going to help her immensely. This is going to make all of their lives better."

Not in U.A.W. But Still Part Of the Strike: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The three U.S. automakers say they are already at a disadvantage to nonunion rivals while labor leaders hope that big gains in negotiations will inspire workers in Southern states to unionize.
Tens of thousands of people who work for Toyota in Kentucky, Mercedes-Benz in Alabama or Tesla in Texas are technically not involved in the high-stakes negotiations taking place between labor and management in and around Detroit.
But they are very much a presence.
Executives at Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent of Chrysler, invoke nonunion automakers, many of them in the South, as a competitive threat that makes it impossible for them to meet striking workers' demands for big raises, more generous benefits and better working conditions.
"Toyota, Honda, Tesla and others are loving this strike because they know the longer it goes on, the better it is for them," Bill Ford, the executive chair of Ford Motor, said in Michigan last week. "They will win, and all of us will lose."
The United Automobile Workers union sees such statements as an attempt to play workers off one another. It views the strikes, entering their sixth week, as a first step toward better pay for not only U.A.W. members but also the nonunion workers that it plans to recruit in the future.
"We won't be used in this phony competition," Shawn Fain, the U.A.W. president, said on Friday, reacting to Mr. Ford's speech. He added, "Nonunion autoworkers are not the enemy. Those are our future union family."
The pay gap between union and nonunion factories has long been a point of contention. Some industry executives have argued that high union wages were a big reason G.M. and Chrysler had to resort to bankruptcy after the 2008 financial crisis.
Union leaders and progressive lawmakers have asserted that the growth of nonunion manufacturing, mostly in the South but also in the Midwest and West, has helped to erode the middle class over the past several decades.
Veteran union autoworkers tend to make more than production workers who are not represented by unions. They often have more say in their schedules and overtime work.
But starting pay at Ford, G.M. and Stellantis factories can be lower than at nonunion factories. And the pay of nonunion workers at Southern auto plants tends to go further because the cost of living there is lower than it is in the Midwest.
Even the geographic divide between union and nonunion plant is not always as clear as it may seem. Toyota and Honda have plants in the South, where unions are weak, but they also have factories in Ohio and Indiana, where unions are stronger. And G.M. and Ford have union operations in Kentucky, Tennessee and Texas.
The debate about auto industry wages has become more urgent as automakers invest billions to build factories that produce batteries for electric cars. Most of those factories are being built in Southern states, like Georgia and Tennessee, where local laws make it more difficult for unions to organize a factory.
"A good agreement with the Detroit Three would be powerful because it gives union organizers better arguments for joining the union," said Ian Greer, a Cornell research professor who studies the effect of electric vehicles on labor.
Even with a union wage of almost $ 32 an hour from her job assembling chassis at a Ford factory in Chicago, Schataan Lyke said she did not have it easy. She is the sole breadwinner for three children and worries about how to afford a prom dress for her oldest.
Ms. Lyke, who has been on strike, said she was glad to have the union behind her. "You've got someone on the outside fighting for you," she said.
But Ms. Lyke, 37, has it better than people doing similar work in the South. At a Nissan factory in Canton, Miss., Morris Mock, 49, makes about $ 1 less than Ms. Lyke per hour even with more than 20 years of experience, he said.
An attempt to unionize Nissan in 2017 failed to win enough support from workers. That means Mr. Mock, one of the people who led the union drive, will not benefit directly from the contract that the U.A.W. works out with automakers. But he said he was glad the union was fighting to protect wages as the industry switched to electric vehicles.
"The market is about to change," Mr. Mock said. "I'm glad that they understand that we must put workers first."
Government statistics suggest wide regional pay gaps. Michigan autoworkers make 22 percent more than production workers in Tennessee, 23 percent more than South Carolina workers and 28 percent more than Alabama workers, according to a Census Bureau survey. Those figures include people who work for suppliers, where pay is often lower than in factories that assemble vehicles.
Some labor experts said the bigger difference between union and nonunion autoworkers had less to do with pay and more with things like mandatory overtime and the scheduling of shifts. Union workers tend to have more say in those matters.
The auto industry has been moving South for decades, drawn by lower costs, weak unions and local government incentives. Foreign automakers have often chosen sites in the South when they set up factories in the United States. BMW and Volvo Cars have factories in South Carolina; Mercedes and Hyundai in Alabama; Toyota in Kentucky; and Volkswagen in Tennessee.
Most of the foreign automakers do not disclose what they pay their workers. Volkswagen, an exception, said the starting pay at its factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., was $ 21.10 for hourly production workers. Veteran workers earn more than $ 29, the company said.
Foreign automakers concentrated in the South sometimes pay their U.S. workers more than Ford, G.M. and Stellantis, according to a study by EY for Autos Drive America, an industry association that represents Nissan, Toyota, Mercedes and others.
The average starting wage at foreign automakers was $ 19 an hour, the survey said, more than the $ 17 starting wage for U.A.W. members. But the average maximum pay at the foreign automakers was $ 28, compared with $ 32 for U.A.W. members under the current contract.
A Nissan spokesman declined to say how much the company pays its U.S. workers, but he said the average was higher than that reported by the Autos Drive America survey.
Tesla, which is based in Texas and has factories there and in Buffalo; Fremont, Calif.; and Sparks, Nev., does not disclose what it pays its workers, but the Detroit automakers say it is less than what they pay.
Ford has said its labor costs, including benefits and bonuses, are 40 percent more per worker than Tesla's. That figure does not include stock awards that at least some Tesla employees receive. On Tesla's website, job advertisements for a production associate pay $ 20 to $ 23 an hour.
Even if autoworker pay in Alabama or Mississippi is less than what it is in Michigan or Illinois, it is often more than what employers in other industries pay in those places.
Working conditions are often a bigger issue than pay, labor representatives say.
In February, Emily Erickson of the University of Warwick in England and Berneece Herbert of Jackson State University published a survey of 211 workers at Mercedes's factory in Vance, Ala., near Tuscaloosa.
The workers reported earning an average of $ 27 an hour at Mercedes, high for the region. But they said they were forced to work overtime or change their work schedules with little notice. Almost half worked more than 50 hours a week. The study also found that white workers made an average of $ 3 more per hour than Black workers.
Mercedes denied that it discriminates. "Our pay structure is equal for all team members regardless of race, age or ethnic origin, and our pay progressions are based on seniority," the company said in a statement.
It noted that the company employed 6,000 people in Alabama, suggesting that the study sampled too few workers. "We do not agree with its conclusions," Mercedes said.
The gulf between pay in the South and the North is certain to widen when Ford, G.M. and Stellantis agree on new contracts with the U.A.W. The union is demanding a 40 percent increase over four years. Ford, G.M. and Stellantis have already offered raises of 23 percent and could go higher.
Unions have made some progress in the South recently. Workers at Blue Bird, which makes school buses in Georgia, voted to join the United Steelworkers in May and are negotiating a contract. Workers at ZF, which makes axles for Mercedes in Alabama, ended a monthlong strike last week after the German company agreed to raise the top hourly wage to $ 23.
Labor leaders say they have already been deluged with calls from workers at Toyota, Volkswagen and Hyundai who expressed interest in organizing unions. Workers at Volkswagen voted not to join the union in 2019, but the environment may be different this time.
"These workers will say, 'Look what the U.A.W. did for these workers at G.M., Ford and Stellantis,"' said Tim Smith, director of U.A.W. Region 8, which includes all of the Southeast.
"We've got organizers on the ground there right now," he said. "We're starting to make our move."

F.A.A. Chief Approved by a Senate Eager to Fill a Long-Vacant Post: [National Desk]

Full text: Michael G. Whitaker, who received bipartisan support, faces the challenge of stabilizing an agency that had been without a permanent leader for more than a year and a half.
The Senate on Tuesday confirmed Michael G. Whitaker, a former Obama administration official, to lead the Federal Aviation Administration, filling a key vacancy that had persisted for more than 18 months.
Mr. Whitaker, 62, was confirmed by a vote of 98 to 0, bringing an end to the carousel of leadership that had plagued the agency for more than half of President Biden's time in office. His swift bipartisan confirmation underscored the desire of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to install a permanent administrator atop the nation's aviation regulator.
Mr. Whitaker now faces the challenge of stabilizing an agency that has been in turmoil and providing the flying public with the confidence that the country's air travel system is safe and reliable. A system outage grounded flights nationwide in January, and a series of near collisions at airports around the country have raised fears about whether the air travel system is being stressed to the point of danger.
The F.A.A. has been without a permanent leader since Stephen Dickson, a former Delta Air Lines executive and an appointee of President Donald J. Trump, stepped down last year. In recent months, Polly Trottenberg, the deputy transportation secretary, has been serving as the agency's acting administrator, but she had been due to relinquish that post this week because of a federal law limiting how long she could run the agency on an acting basis.
Mr. Whitaker's confirmation to the position, which has a five-year term, comes after the Biden administration failed in its first attempt to appoint a permanent administrator. Last year, Mr. Biden nominated Phillip A. Washington, the chief executive of Denver International Airport, for the post. But Mr. Washington faced stiff criticism over his limited experience in aviation, and he withdrew from consideration in March.
Mr. Biden nominated Mr. Whitaker, the chief operating officer of Supernal, a Hyundai Motor Group company that is developing air taxis, in September. He has a long résumé in aviation and is deeply familiar with the F.A.A., having served as the agency's deputy administrator during the Obama administration. He was also an executive at United Airlines.
Mr. Whitaker fared much better in the Senate, with Republicans and Democrats on the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation welcoming his extensive aviation experience. The panel approved his nomination in a voice vote last week, setting the stage for his confirmation by the full Senate.
"Whitaker's overwhelming confirmation demonstrates the Senate's commitment to getting aviation right," Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington and the committee's chairwoman, said in a statement on Tuesday. "There is a lot to do on F.A.A. staffing, technology upgrades and safety improvements, and Whitaker is the right person to lead it."

General Dynamics Near
A New Labor Contract
The United Automobile Workers union and General Dynamics have reached a tentative agreement over a new labor contract covering 1,100 workers at some of the U.S. defense contractor's facilities, staving off a potential strike.
The four-year deal, which must be ratified by the workers, provides a 14 percent wage increase, protects against inflation, reduces the time it takes to get to top pay and "beats back the company's proposed health care concessions," the U.A.W. said.
U.A.W. members had overwhelmingly voted this month to authorize a strike after a four-year agreement was set to expire this past Sunday.

Chief of Qatar Airways
To Retire After 27 Years
Qatar Airways Group chief executive Akbar Al Baker, right, is stepping down after 27 years leading the company.
Mr. Al Baker's retirement will go into effect Nov. 5, Qatar Airways said on Monday.
He will be succeeded by Badr Mohammed Al-Meer -- the current chief operating officer of Hamad International Airport in Doha, the hub of Qatar's national carrier.
During his tenure at Qatar Airways, Mr. Al Baker became known for being one of the most outspoken leaders in the airline industry.
Mr. Al Baker has also made some controversial comments over his career -- including suggesting that women can't run airlines and for calling American carriers "crap" and that their passengers were "always being served by grandmothers." He later apologized for both remarks.

Daechang Will Open
A Factory in Georgia
A South Korean company that makes automotive seat frames will open a factory in Georgia to supply a new Hyundai Motor Group plant.
Daechang Seat Corp., based in Gyeongju, South Korea, said on Monday that it would invest $ 72.5 million in a plant in Savannah, hiring more than 500 people.
It is the latest company to announce a plant to supply Hyundai's $ 7.6 billion plant to assemble electric vehicles and batteries in Ellabell, near Savannah. The Hyundai plant, announced last year, could grow to 8,500 employees and could begin producing vehicles as early as 2024.
Daechang Seat opened a factory in Phenix City, Ala., in 2019. The company announced a $ 23.4 million expansion in Phenix City last year, saying it would build a new building and hire an additional 300 people. The company employs more than 5,000 people in seven countries.

Tesla Says Justice Department Is Broadening Inquiry Into the Company's Business Practices: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Department of Justice has sought documents related to vehicle range and "personal benefits," Tesla said.
The Department of Justice has expanded its inquiry into Tesla's business practices to include how far its vehicles can travel on a full charge and "personal benefits" to high-ranking executives or large shareholders, the company said without elaborating.
The disclosure followed recent news reports that the carmaker appears to have misled customers about how far its vehicles could travel before needing to be plugged in.
Tesla also said in a regulatory filing that the government had subpoenaed documents related to "personal benefits" and unidentified "related parties," a term that often refers to top management, company directors or large shareholders.
The U.S. attorney's office in New York has looked into whether funds were misused in a planned house for Elon Musk, the company's chief executive, near Tesla's factory in Austin, Texas, The Wall Street Journal reported in August. The U.S. attorney's office declined to comment on Monday.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
"To our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred," the company said in the filing, a quarterly report to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Tesla said it was cooperating with the authorities.
Reuters and Consumer Reports have reported that Tesla vehicles fell short, in road testing, of the range indicated by the Environmental Protection Agency, which tests cars on rollers in a laboratory. Carmakers have some discretion in how they configure cars for the tests and can influence the results.
The range of all battery powered cars suffers in cold weather, but a Tesla Model Y sport utility vehicle that Consumer Reports tested fell at least 50 miles short of the claimed range even in warm weather.
The Ford Mach-E and Volkswagen ID.4 S.U.V.s exceeded their claimed warm-weather ranges when tested by Consumer Reports under identical conditions as the Tesla vehicle. A Hyundai Ioniq 5 came within two miles of its E.P.A. range.
Tesla had earlier disclosed that the Justice Department had issued subpoenas for documents related to its self-driving software. Tesla is the target of lawsuits claiming the software played a major role in accidents that caused deaths and injuries and does not live up to the claims about its performance made by Mr. Musk and the company.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the S.E.C., and various local and international authorities have also requested information, Tesla said without providing details.
Tesla's shares have fallen 13 percent since Wednesday when the company reported that profit in the third quarter slumped 44 percent after it slashed prices of its models.

Tesla Profit Plunges 44% As Musk Cites Challenges: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The automaker reported a sharp drop in profits in the third quarter after slashing car prices by around 25 percent in an attempt to compete.
Tesla's profit slumped in the third quarter, disappointing Wall Street expectations, after the carmaker cut prices to maintain its dominance of the market for electric vehicles.
Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, also dashed hopes that a new model called the Cybertruck would quickly revive earnings, warning that the pickup truck would take at least 18 months to become profitable after it goes on sale at the end of November.
The company reported a net profit of $ 1.9 billion from July through September, a 44 percent drop from the $ 3.3 billion Tesla made in the same three-month period a year earlier.
Saying he wanted to "temper expectations," Mr. Musk warned on Wednesday during a conference call with financial analysts and investors that "there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with Cybertruck and making the Cybertruck cash flow positive."
He added, "The blood, sweat and tears that will be required to achieve that is just staggering."
The company has slashed car prices by around 25 percent in the United States during the last year, putting the priority on sales rather than profit. The least expensive version of Tesla's best selling car, the Model Y sport-utility vehicle, now starts at $ 44,000 before government incentives, or roughly as much as the comparable Toyota RAV4 Prime plug-in hybrid, which has an electric motor and a gasoline engine.
"We continue to believe that an industry leader needs to be a cost leader," Tesla said in a statement.
Despite the cuts, Tesla's share of the electric vehicle market in the United States slumped to 50 percent in the third quarter from 60 percent in the first quarter, according to Kelley Blue Book. BMW, Mercedes, Hyundai, General Motors and other automakers have been introducing new electric vehicles at a rapid clip, eroding Tesla's dominance.
Tesla is also facing stiffer competition in China and Europe, two large markets for battery-powered cars, from local automakers.
Analysts had expected a decline in profit after Tesla said earlier this month that sales fell in the third quarter because of temporary factory shutdowns to retool assembly lines at factories in Austin, Texas, and Shanghai. But the slump was greater than expected.
At least until recently, Tesla was more profitable than established U.S. automakers, allowing it to cut prices. "I view it as a way to defend market share at the expense of margin," said Kevin Roberts, director of industry insights and analytics at CarGurus, an online auto sales site.
The company may not be able to continue cutting prices indefinitely. Its net profit margin in the third quarter was 8 percent, in line with that of traditional carmakers.
Investors had been hoping that the Cybertruck pickup would revive sales. The company said Wednesday that it expected to begin deliveries of the vehicle on Nov. 30, two years behind schedule.
Mr. Musk acknowledged that Tesla was facing severe challenges mass producing the vehicle, which has an unusual stainless-steel body. The material resists rust and does not need to be painted, but is much more difficult to shape and weld.
"We dug our own grave with Cybertruck," Mr. Musk said.
Ford Motor, Rivian and General Motors have reported lackluster sales of electric pickup trucks after an initial surge in customer interest, suggesting that the market for such vehicles may not be quite as big as industry executives and analysts had once thought. This week, G.M. said it would delay by a year plans to start producing electric pickups at a factory in Michigan, and Ford said it was slowing production of its F-150 Lightning truck.
Mr. Musk insisted that demand for the Cybertruck was "off the charts" and that more than one million people have placed orders. But he noted that higher interest rates have led to higher monthly loan payments, reducing consumers' ability to buy new cars.
"We have to make it at a price that people can afford," he said.
Tesla could benefit if the United Automobile Workers strike against Ford, G.M. and Stellantis expands to more factories. So far, workers at six plants owned by the three companies have walked off the job. Tesla workers do not belong to a union.
Tesla's stock price, which fell nearly 5 percent in regular trading on Wednesday, was down another 3 percent in extended trading after Mr. Musk's conference call.
"I'm not saying things will be bad," he said of the economy, "but I'm saying they might be."

Used E.V.s Becoming A Good Deal: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The prices of used battery-powered models have fallen sharply, as the supply of cars and trucks has improved.
If you're in the market for an electric vehicle, the time might be right to consider a used one.
The high cost of electric vehicles has long dissuaded many people from buying one. Last year, for example, electric cars and trucks were so popular and supply so limited that waiting lists were common. And some lucky individuals found they could sell their ride for more than they paid for it.
But over the past year, prices of used electric vehicles have fallen significantly. In addition, climate legislation passed in 2022 includes a tax credit to encourage more people to buy used electric cars and trucks.
Auto inflation has eased
Used cars as a whole are around 7 percent less expensive than they were a year ago, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But used battery-powered models are 28 percent less expensive than a year ago, according to Recurrent, a research firm that specializes in the used electric vehicle market.
Shortages of new cars during the pandemic made new and used cars more expensive, as strong demand for new vehicles spilled over into the used market. Now, supply chains and inventories have improved, and new electric vehicles -- and new cars generally -- have become more available.
Tesla, which sells most new electric cars, has cut prices several times this year to attract buyers, forcing other automakers to lower prices and offer promotions. Those cuts have helped to push down used car prices.
Some analysts think used electric car prices could fall further, though perhaps not as fast. Higher interest rates and a strong supply of new vehicles ought to continue driving prices down, according to J.D. Power, a market research firm.
Are electric cars a bad investment?
Most cars depreciate over time. That said, electric cars and trucks are holding their value better today than they did before the pandemic. That's because there are more places to charge these cars and people have become more familiar with them, said David Paris, director of market intelligence at J.D. Power Valuation Services.
If you bought, say, a used BMW i3 in 2019, Mr. Paris said, it retained only around 30 percent of the manufacturer's suggested retail prices after three years. But now the i3 retains more than 50 percent of its value, suggesting that buyers have fewer concerns about the cars and specifically the health of their batteries, the most expensive part of those vehicles.
Liz Najman, a researcher at Recurrent, said most used electric cars were still new enough that their batteries should be covered under warranty. "Most used E.V.s in the country have at least an eight year, 100,000-mile warranty on their battery," she said.
You should still check the health of a car's battery before buying because replacing it can be expensive. Recurrent provides reports on the health of a car's battery, and apps like Leaf Spy and MyGreenVolt allow car owners to monitor their batteries, depending on the model.
You might be eligible for a tax credit
The Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden's climate bill, grants a tax credit of up to $ 4,000 for buying used electric vehicles that cost no more than $ 25,000.
The credit is available to individuals who earn up to $ 75,000 a year and couples who make $ 150,000 or less. According to Recurrent, around 27 percent of the used electric car inventory is eligible for the credit, up from 17 percent last year.
To qualify, a used vehicle has to be at least two years old. Buyers cannot claim the credit more than once every three years. But, unlike with the tax credits for new vehicles, there are no restrictions on where a used electric vehicle is assembled or where the materials in its batteries come from.
More options are available
Before the pandemic, some of the most popular electric vehicles had been on the road for only a few years at most. Among the few electric models often found on the used car lot, many were luxury models like the Tesla Model S, a large sedan, or the Tesla Model X, a three-row sport-utility vehicle.
The market is much bigger and more diverse now. The number of used electric cars for sale has tripled over the past year, according to Recurrent. A recent scroll through used car listings in the New York area showed a wide range of cars, including a Porsche Taycan listed for more than $ 80,000 and Chevrolet, Hyundai and Nissan models selling for less than $ 25,000.
Buying a used electric vehicle might not be right for everyone, especially if you have to drive long distances or live somewhere where charging stations are few and far between. But if you have a place to plug in and don't frequently drive several hundred miles a day, you can get a good deal.

The Climate Fight Takes On Appliances: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: More than a year after its passage, much about President Biden's climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, is working.
America is putting in more solar panels than ever before, with installations expected to be up 52 percent compared with last year. The law has helped lock in America's transition to electric vehicles. Companies have announced more than $ 60 billion in E.V. manufacturing investments since the I.R.A. passed, and Hyundai is rushing to finish its new E.V. factory in Georgia because the law's incentives are so good. Across the country, investment in all forms of clean-energy manufacturing has ramped up, with spending this spring five times the level of two years ago, according to a new tracker from M.I.T. and the Rhodium Group, a research firm.
The law is supposed to do more than transform the economy, though. It's also supposed to change how Americans live. The I.R.A. contains nearly $ 9 billion in rebates meant to help people upgrade and decarbonize their homes -- for example, install an induction stove, a heat pump or a new electrical or insulation system. Since the climate law passed last year, Mr. Biden and Democrats in Congress have hyped the savings on energy that these policies will bring to consumers; that is, after all, the inflation that the law is meant to be reducing.
But I have grown worried about these efforts -- and about the next phase of the I.R.A.'s rollout more broadly. The building sector accounts for about 13 percent of America's climate pollution, so the success of these programs is essential to the country's decarbonization efforts. Yet more important, the execution of these programs poses a political risk for the Biden administration. These rebate and tax credit programs are some of the law's most visible provisions. Other than the law's electric vehicle subsidies, these home-focused policies will be most Americans' best opportunity to get I.R.A. money in their pockets.
If the programs fail, they could seriously mar the I.R.A.'s public image. And right now, they are faltering.
Perhaps the biggest problem is inherent to their design. The most successful federal programs are simple, straightforward and easy to use. Think of the U.S. Postal Service sending free at-home Covid tests to all Americans or the relative ease of signing up for and receiving Social Security benefits. These new home-upgrade programs, meanwhile, seem likely to be especially persnickety, complicated and onerous for many Americans.
That's because, first, there are a lot of programs in play. Although the I.R.A. streamlined some of the most important existing climate tax credits (for example, for greening the grid), it included four home-focused programs. Two of these programs are tax credits meant to give Americans a tax discount when they install a new rooftop solar system, a geothermal-powered heater, a heat pump or another technology that reduces demand for carbon-emitting fossil fuels. Unlike other tax credits in the law, these programs have no income cap, so they can be used by wealthy Americans who can presumably afford to pay upfront to install residential equipment like a water heater. But like other new tax credits in the law, they require Americans to have some federal tax liability in the first place. If you owe nothing on your taxes, then you can't get a discount.
These credits are also likely to be generous in aggregate, but in some cases they will be too small to spur a serious change of behavior. Installing a whole-home heat-pump system, for instance, can cost tens of thousands of dollars, but the I.R.A.'s new tax credit will cover only $ 2,000 of that in one calendar year.
That's when another set of programs is supposed to come in. The I.R.A. introduced a pair of rebate programs meant to help working- and middle-class Americans afford to upgrade appliances and other features of their homes. These two programs, known as HOMES and HEEHRA, are important. When it's finally put in place, HEEHRA will lower the cost of heat pumps and other climate-friendly appliances at the point of sale, making them more affordable to consumers, including those who are not even aware of the policy. More than perhaps any other programs in the law, these rebates are meant to allow low-income Americans to reduce their monthly energy costs. And because they involve direct cash grants, using the rebates will not require owing any taxes to the federal government. That is huge for retirees and Social Security recipients, many of whom have no earned income and little to no federal tax liability.
Regardless of how consumers are reimbursed, the programs are exceedingly -- perhaps even fatally -- complicated. The reason they have yet to take effect is that although these programs will be overseen by the Department of Energy, they will be administered separately by each state's energy office. The department is still finalizing the last few rules that will govern how these programs work. When it finishes that process, then states will apply for their share of the money. Only then -- after states receive their funding and set up their programs -- will they be able to start disbursing it to their residents.
So far, few state offices have received any funds from the programs -- not even the preliminary funds meant to help them hire more staff members and manage administration costs. This could directly hurt the programs' chances of success in the next year. State energy offices employ anywhere from a handful of people to more than 100, and they have now been tasked with overseeing complicated, high-stakes federal programs.
The experts and business leaders I've talked to think that these problems will push any serious efforts to carry out the programs well into next year. Montana has said that it doesn't expect to make rebates available until the first half of 2024. Georgia's energy office recently estimated that rebates would become available by Sept. 30, 2024, at the latest -- barely a month before the presidential election.
Even then, major questions remain about how the programs will work. Democratic lawmakers have called on the Energy Department to consider allowing the rebates to be used retroactively -- meaning that someone who bought, say, a heat pump in late 2022 could get free money for it under the law. But that would sharply increase the program's complexity, and it would more quickly deplete the limited funds allocated to the rebates. The programs draw from fixed pools of funding -- about $ 250 million per state -- and when that money runs out at the state level, the rebates will lapse in most cases.
This is not the only place where the I.R.A.'s administration is mired in confusion. The initial rules of the home energy rebates have left state officials unsure of whether they can use someone's eligibility for other social welfare programs, such as food stamps, to gauge whether they qualify for a rebate. (The Energy Department has published guidelines about this, but they are not comprehensive.) That may force states to set up expensive processes that will duplicate work that's already been done and make it even more burdensome for people to use these programs. It's also unclear whether households can use several Energy Department programs at once -- such as the new HOMES rebates and the longstanding weatherization assistance program -- to reduce the cost of a major project.
Unless the Biden administration acts now, these programs could be a big mess by next fall. They will have confusing criteria, work differently in each state and may require applicants to go through time-sucking paperwork before receiving any funds. They will not showcase the nimble, modern government, fighting for working people, that Mr. Biden hopes to sell to voters.
The I.R.A. is going to change people's lives -- I have little doubt of that. But only eventually. And for the next year, many of the law's benefits for average Americans will remain largely theoretical. The M.I.T. and Rhodium tracker says that of the $ 137 billion in announced clean-energy investment, only $ 37 billion -- just 27 percent -- has started to flow. There is a growing risk that as the presidential election arrives, the law's most world-changing programs to stimulate clean electricity and E. V.s will have yet to show their impact, and its smaller programs will be mired in public operation headaches.
There is recent precedent for such a failure. Although most Americans now approve of the Affordable Care Act, the law was blamed for Democrats' losses in the 2010 midterms, and it remained desperately unpopular for much of the following decade. Even when Donald Trump was elected, most independents still disapproved of the law and wanted to see it rolled back. Only in 2017, when Republicans repeatedly tried to repeal the law, did popular opinion swing in its favor. It has remained popular ever since.
The I.R.A., like the Affordable Care Act, aims for a higher purpose than being politically popular. But the law's survival depends on its -- and Mr. Biden's -- ability to win a literal popularity contest next year. Mr. Trump and other Republicans are already cultivating a hatred of the clean-energy transition among voters; failing rebate programs for consumers would be a gift to them. And if Mr. Trump wins next year, his team will have plenty of opportunities to undermine the I.R.A.'s emission-cutting policies, even without repealing the whole law.
The aspirations of 30 years of climate policies ride on the I.R.A. If this one law is successful, it will open up other ways of making policy for the environment and economy; if it fails, then lawmakers will shy away from tackling climate change for years. The law's home-rebate programs will not be large enough to fully decarbonize America's millions of buildings. But if they are successful, then they will allow the creation of future policy that is.
The I.R.A., I believe, is still on track to be a success. But voters won't see the new E.V. factories that it's building or the sparkling new manufacturing hubs. They will see what's at Home Depot or in the back of their contractor's pickup truck. And if people have to fill out 20 pages of paperwork just to save less money on a heat pump than they initially hoped for, that's what they'll always remember about the I.R.A.
The climate fight might be waged in the streets. But it will be won in the appliance aisle.

Fortune's Chief Executive Will Step Down in 2024
Alan Murray, the chief executive of Fortune, announced on Wednesday that he would step down next year. In a note to staff members, Mr. Murray said he had agreed with Fortune's owner and board that he would help the company with a transition to new leadership and then leave his role at the end of April. He said that during his tenure, Fortune had been established as an independent company, expanded its audience and revenue, and "produced three straight years of profits." Mr. Murray, 68, joined Fortune as the top editor in 2014. Before he joined Fortune, he was the president of the Pew Research Foundation and worked at The Wall Street Journal for nearly 20 years. He said in his note on Wednesday that he had no plans to retire after he stepped down and that Mr. Jiaravanon had asked him to consider staying on in a different role. KATIE ROBERTSON

Hyundai and Kia to Use Tesla's Charging System
Hyundai and Kia say that they are adopting North American Charging Standard ports for their electric vehicles in the U.S. and Canada, which will give the vehicles access to thousands of Tesla Superchargers across the two countries and Mexico. Tesla's Superchargers are coveted by other automakers because it has more direct current fast-charging plugs in the U.S. than any other network, and its stations are in prime locations along freeway travel corridors. Hyundai Motor North America said Thursday that new Hyundai electric vehicles in the U.S. will come with the N.A.C.S. port starting in 2024's fourth quarter. It will begin in Canada in the first half of 2025. Hyundai's luxury brand, Genesis, will use the ports. Kia said it plans to build the port into new electric vehicles sold in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, also in the fourth quarter of next year. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Constellation Lifts Targets for Second-Quarter Profit
Constellation Brands raised its annual profit target on Thursday after higher prices and strong demand for its beers and spirits drove sales and profits in the second quarter. Alcohol producers like Constellation and Brown-Forman have benefited from increasing prices, helping offset steeper raw material costs. Constellation also raised the annual sales forecast for its beer business. Its Modelo Especial and Corona brand beers and premium wine labels Meiomi and Kim Crawford retained demand despite a broader consumer slowdown in the U.S. Modelo Especial's dollar share at retail outlets was 8.5 percent, while that of Anheuser-Busch InBev's Bud Light was 8.1 percent this year. Constellation now expects fiscal 2024 comparable earnings per share between $ 12.00 and $ 12.20, as against its previous forecast of profit between $ 11.70

Despite Cutting Prices at Tesla, Sales Are Down: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Analysts expected a decline in sales for the quarter. Still, the dip may raise concerns about flagging demand.
Sales of Tesla electric cars slipped from July through September after the company paused production at some factories to upgrade assembly lines.
The company delivered 435,000 vehicles worldwide in the third quarter, down from 466,000 in the second quarter. Wall Street analysts had expected the decline, which they attributed to production slowdowns as Tesla refitted factories in the United States and China.
The decline "was caused by planned downtimes for factory upgrades," Tesla said in a statement on Monday, adding that it still expects to deliver 1.8 million vehicles this year, up from 1.3 million in 2022.
Still, the dip in sales may renew concerns that demand for Tesla cars is slackening even after the company cut prices. In China, Tesla is trying to fend off Chinese carmakers, like BYD and Nio, that are rolling out new models more quickly.
In the United States, Tesla faces increased competition from established carmakers like Ford Motor, General Motors, Hyundai and Volkswagen. They have been chipping away at Tesla's dominance; the company accounted for about 60 percent of the electric vehicle market in the second quarter.
Another of the new competitors is Rivian, which said on Monday that it delivered 15,600 electric vans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in the third quarter, up from 12,600 in the previous quarter. Though Rivian is far smaller than Tesla, its pickups pose a competitive threat to Tesla's Cybertruck pickup. Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, has said the Cybertruck will go on sale by the end of the year.
Tesla cut prices significantly on all its models this year to fend off competition and keep its sales growing at a rapid clip. As a result, its profit margin has fallen sharply, though it remains higher than those of more established carmakers.
More recently, the company has slowed or stopped production at its factory in Austin, Texas, to prepare for production of the Cybertruck. In China, Tesla paused some production as it switched assembly lines to an upgraded version of its Model 3 sedan known as the Highland.
On an annual basis, Tesla continued to grow faster than the traditional carmakers. Sales grew 26 percent from the third quarter of 2022, when Tesla delivered 344,000 vehicles.
Tesla could also benefit from the United Automobile Workers strike against Ford, G.M. and Stellantis, the owner of Jeep, Ram and Chrysler. Sharply higher wages for unionized workers at the Detroit carmakers would widen Tesla's cost advantage. Tesla workers do not belong to the U.A.W., although the union has said it plans to try to organize them.

Artists' Soccer, 'Drunk vs. Stoned': [Style Desk]

Full text: In Montauk, an end-of-summer art show and sporting event served as a kind of referendum on two altered states.
A bunch of artists, along with some friends and family members, said goodbye to summer by playing soccer in Montauk, N.Y., on Sept. 17.
It wasn't the usual game. The participants split into two teams, Drunk and Stoned, and conducted themselves accordingly.
The madcap sporting event went along with an exhibition, "Drunk vs. Stoned 3," in which the works of 70 artists were displayed at a Montauk gallery and the Ranch, a 26-acre horse farm and venue owned by the art dealer Max Levai.
The first "Drunk vs. Stoned" was held in 2004 at a gallery in Greenwich Village. The critic Jerry Saltz called it "one of the most diverting group shows of the year," adding that it was "also one of the daffiest." There was a sequel the next year, along with a soccer game at Chelsea Piers in Manhattan. Legend has it that the Stoned team lost that contest because it didn't notice that Drunk had added three players after halftime.
It's no secret that painters and poets have long sought inspiration in altered states, and the show notes for the third "Drunk vs. Stoned" event compared and contrasted works seemingly informed by alcohol and cannabis. Viewers were encouraged to ponder just how, as the organizers wrote, "the lowered inhibitions and impulsive decisions of drunk stand in stark contrast to the heightened sensitivity and methodical meandering of stoned."
Artists who took part in the exhibition included: Rachel Harrison and Laura Owens, who have been the subjects of full-scale surveys at the Whitney Museum of American Art; Katherine Bradford, who has works in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Brooklyn Museum; Jamian Juliano-Villani, whose paintings were featured in last year's Venice Bienniale; and Nate Lowman, whose works have appeared at the Museum of Modern Art and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.
On the morning of the game, which was scheduled to start at 2 p.m., Mr. Levai, 35, was not pleased to see a black Hyundai parked in the gravel area near one of the goals. The car spoiled the tableau he had hoped to establish on the property and detracted from the five grand sculptures by Matt Johnson, each strategically placed near the undulating expanse where the game would take place.
"A lot of the sculptures here are pink and white, and the barns are white," Mr. Levai said. "The black Hyundai is a big interruption in this aesthetics trajectory."
The car also didn't fit in with the recreational zone that would include a massage table and two makeshift bars. Mr. Levai said he would have moved the vehicle himself, but it was locked, and he couldn't track down the person who had parked it. He repaired to his hilltop residence, where he hit upon a solution: toilet paper.
It seemed that Mr. Levai -- who struck out on his own after he was ousted from the presidency of the Marlborough Gallery in 2020 -- had ordered far too many rolls of industrial-grade Scott, which he was keeping in his pantry. Now he had a use for them.
He enlisted two children, the sons of people involved in the exhibition, and together they covered the eyesore, using shaving cream as a binding agent. When the job was done, the Hyundai could almost pass for an art installation.
Mr. Levai, the son of the former Marlborough Gallery director Pierre Levai, has not always had a smooth time on Long Island's East End since becoming the owner of the Ranch in 2020, according to reports in local news outlets and art publications. In July, there was an altercation with a neighbor, the gallerist Adam Lindemann, who owns the adjacent estate, Eothen. Last month, a supervisor for East Hampton, which contains Montauk, said the town could seek an injunction against Mr. Levai over how he is using land that has been set aside as an agricultural preserve. (Mr. Levai had no comment on his dealings with the town or his plans for the Ranch.)
As game time approached, the artist Scott Reeder, a curator of the first "Drunk vs. Stoned" shows, said that Mr. Levai had mentioned the idea of reviving the concept about a year ago. "I said, 'If you were going to restage it, do it here,"' Mr. Reeder recalled.
As the Stoned players began warming up on the field, several Drunk team members downed shots and beer. Both teams had uniforms made for the occasion, with "Stoned" or "Drunk" printed across the back. The referee, Jose Martos, an art dealer, suggested he was open to bribes, telling players, "One hundred dollars, if you want to win."
In the game's opening minutes, Stoned was lively and focused. It had youth on its side: The two boys who had helped TP the Hyundai, ages 11 and 12, were in the lineup. (They did not partake of anything on offer at the makeshift bars.)
Drunk was sloppy, but it had a secret weapon in its goalkeeper, Paololuca Barbieri Marchi, a filmmaker and a founder of the art collective Alterazioni Video. Without his shot-blocking prowess, the game might have been a blowout.
The 12-year-old player scored the first goal. The artist Borna Sammak, a member of the Drunk team, collapsed to the field, though he was not injured. He spent 10 minutes lounging in the grass, sipping a tequila drink.
Esteban Chacon, a surf coach in Costa Rica and Montauk, had the second goal for Stoned. "This is vengeance," said Mr. Reeder, who had played for the losing Stoned squad in 2005 and was on the same side again.
"Come on, Drunk, you got this!" said the Drunk coach, Ellie Rines, who runs 56 Henry, a gallery in New York's Chinatown. Seconds later, Alex Hubbard, a mixed-media artist, kicked in the team's first goal.
In the first half's final minutes -- with Stoned leading, 4-3 -- the players could hear the sounds of Big Karma, a Grateful Dead cover band that had set up about 100 yards from the field. As the musicians went into an extended jam, the Stoned team seemed to fall under a spell.
At halftime, a tow truck was rolling in reverse toward the Hyundai. Devin Troy Strother, a painter, confessed that he had left it in the gravel lot. The keys had ended up locked inside after a series of mix-ups, he said.
Nearby, Stoned players were making use of a hookah-like bong. The Drunk team was huddling with Coach Rines, who was in pep talk mode. "We've got grit!" she said. "I think we can take this!"
In the second half, many Stoned players were moving with a kind of contented aimlessness. They seemed to wither when Billy Grant, an artist playing for Drunk, engaged in some aggressive trash-talking. "I thought, 'Just start screaming, to scare them,"' he said. Drunk won, 5-4.
The next day, in a phone interview, Mr. Levai offered the opinion that the Grateful Dead cover band was a factor in the outcome. "Some people thought it would be an advantage for the Stoned team," he said, "but my feeling was that it might have ended up being a distraction."

Justice Dept. Targets eBay Over Unlawful Sales
The Justice Department filed a civil complaint against eBay, claiming the online marketplace unlawfully sold and distributed hundreds of thousands of products like pesticides and motor vehicle emission-evading devices that violate environmental laws.
The complaint Wednesday claims eBay sold, offered for sale or caused the sale of more than 343,000 aftermarket devices that try to evade motor vehicle emissions controls.
It also alleges the company unlawfully distributed or sold at least 23,000 pesticides that were unregistered, misbranded or for restricted use.
In addition, the complaint claims eBay distributed more than 5,600 painting and coating removal products that include methylene chloride.
eBay called the government's actions "entirely unprecedented," and said that it planned to vigorously defend itself.

Hyundai and Kia Recall 3.4 Million Vehicles
Hyundai and Kia are recalling nearly 3.4 million vehicles in the U.S. and telling owners to park them outside and away from structures because of the risk of engine compartment fires.
The recalls cover multiple car and S.U.V. models from the 2010 through 2019 model years including Hyundai's Santa Fe SUV and Kia's Sorrento SUV.
Documents posted Wednesday by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration say the anti-lock brake control module can leak fluid and cause an electrical short, which can touch off a fire while the vehicles are parked or being driven.
Dealers will replace the anti-lock brake fuse at no cost.
Hyundai reported 21 fires in the affected vehicles in the U.S., and another 22 "thermal incidents" including smoke, burning and melting of parts, the documents say. Kia reported 10 fires and melting incidents. ASSOCIATED PRESS
ECONOMY
Orders for Durable Goods Exceeded Expectations
Orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods rose in August as an increase in machinery and other products offset a drop in civilian aircraft, and business spending on equipment appeared to regain momentum after faltering early in the third quarter.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday also showed shipments of capital goods rebounding sharply last month, a sign of resilience in both business investment and the overall economy despite the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary policy tightening. The surge in shipments compensated for downward revisions to July's data.
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft meant to last three years or more, gained 0.2 percent last month. Data for July was revised lower to show orders for these goods decreasing 5.6 percent instead of 5.2 percent, as previously reported. REUTERS

Key to Walkout: Industry's Shift To Electric Cars: [National Desk]

Full text: Carmakers are anxious to keep costs down as they ramp up electric vehicle manufacturing, while striking workers want to preserve jobs as the industry shifts to batteries.
A battle between Detroit carmakers and the United Auto Workers union, which escalated on Friday with targeted strikes in three locations, is unfolding amid a once-in-a-century technological upheaval that poses huge risks for both the companies and the union.
The strike has come as the traditional automakers invest billions to develop electric vehicles while still making most of their money from gasoline-driven cars. The negotiations will determine the balance of power between workers and management, possibly for years to come. That makes the strike as much a struggle for the industry's future as it is about wages, benefits and working conditions.
The established carmakers -- General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, Jeep and Ram -- are trying to defend their profits and their place in the market in the face of stiff competition from Tesla and foreign automakers. Some executives and analysts have characterized what is happening in the industry as the biggest technological transformation since Henry Ford's moving assembly line started up at the beginning of the 20th century.
Nearly 13,000 U.A.W. workers walked off the job at three plants in Ohio, Michigan and Missouri on Friday after talks between the unions and the companies in three separate negotiations failed to result in agreements before a Thursday deadline. Pay is one of the biggest sticking points: The union is demanding a 40 percent pay increase over four years but the automakers have offered roughly half as much.
But the talks are about more than pay. Workers are trying to defend jobs as manufacturing shifts from internal combustion engines to batteries. Because they have fewer parts, electric cars can be made with fewer workers than gasoline vehicles. A favorable outcome for the U.A.W. would also give the union a strong calling card if, as some expect, it then tries to organize employees at Tesla and other nonunion carmakers like Hyundai, which is planning to manufacture electric vehicles at a massive new factory in Georgia.
"The transition to E.V.s is dominating every bit of this discussion," said John Casesa, senior managing director at the investment firm Guggenheim Partners who previously headed strategy at Ford Motor.
"It's unspoken," Mr. Casesa added. "But really, it's all about positioning the union to have a central role in the new electric industry."
Under pressure from government officials and changing consumer demand, Ford, G.M. and Stellantis are investing billions to retool their sprawling operations to build electric vehicles, which are critical to addressing climate change. But they are making little if any profit on those vehicles while Tesla, which dominates electric car sales, is profitable and growing fast.
Ford said in July that its electric vehicle business would lose $ 4.5 billion this year. If the union got all the increases in pay, pensions and other benefits it is seeking, the company said, its workers' total compensation would be twice as much as Tesla's employees.
Union demands would force Ford to scrap its investments in electric vehicles, Jim Farley, the company's chief executive, said in an interview on Friday. "We want to actually have a conversation about a sustainable future," he said, "not one that forces us to choose between going out of business and rewarding our workers."
For workers, the biggest concern is that electric vehicles have far fewer parts than gasoline models and will render many jobs obsolete. Plants that make mufflers, catalytic converters, fuel injectors and other components that electric cars don't need will have to be overhauled or shut down.
Many new battery and electric vehicle factories are springing up and could employ workers from the plants that have shut down. But automakers are building most aggressively in the South where labor laws are tilted against union organizers, rather than in the Midwest, where the U.A.W. has more clout. One of the union's demands is that workers in the new factories be covered by the automakers' national labor contracts -- a demand that the automakers have said they can't meet because those plants are owned by joint ventures. The union also wants to regain the right to strike to block plant shutdowns.
"We are at the dawn of another industrial revolution and the way we're going is the way we went in the last industrial revolution -- a lot of profit for a few and misery and not good jobs for the many," said Madeline Janis, executive director of Jobs to Move America, an advocacy group that works closely with the U.A.W. and other unions.
"The U.A.W. is really taking a stand for communities across the country to make sure this transition benefits everybody," Ms. Janis added.
Automakers have been racking up record profits during the last decade, but they cannot afford to lose time from work stoppages in their race to compete with Tesla and foreign automakers.
The three companies are already struggling to get their electric vehicle business going. A new G.M. battery factory in Ohio has been slow to produce batteries, delaying electric versions of the Chevrolet Silverado pickup and other vehicles. Ford this year had to suspend production of its electric F-150 Lightning in February after a battery caught fire in one of the pickups that was parked near the factory for a quality check. And Stellantis won't even begin selling any fully electric vehicles in the United States until next year.
Those problems and Tesla's growing sales could put the union in a strong position to extract a good deal.
On Thursday, in a sign that automakers are willing to go much further than they had previously, G.M. offered a 20 percent pay raise over four years. That is half of what the union is seeking but far more than workers received in recent contracts. President Biden on Friday strongly supported the union in remarks at the White House. The administration has been pouring billions into programs to promote electric vehicles and does not want a strike to delay a centerpiece of its climate policy.
Despite all the money that automakers have made in recent years, their executives express a profound unease about the growth of electric vehicles, which account for 7 percent of the U.S. new car market so far this year and are on track to surpass sales of one million this year. Managers are acutely aware that traditional companies like theirs have a poor track record of retaining dominance after a big change in technology. Witness the way that Apple sidelined Nokia and Motorola as cellphones became smartphones.
Auto company executives and most industry analysts underestimated how quickly electric vehicles would catch on and cannot confidently forecast how sales, which have been bumpy lately, will grow in the future. "I don't think anyone can perfectly predict what the adoption will be," Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, said in an interview with The New York Times last month.
Speaking to "CBS Mornings" on Friday, Ms. Barra said an excessive pay raise would undermine G.M.'s ability to continue producing vehicles with internal combustion engines while also developing electric vehicles. "This is a critical juncture where investing is very important," she said.
Still, unions and their supporters are unlikely to express much sympathy for auto executives. Ms. Barra, Mr. Farley of Ford and the chief executive of Stellantis, Carlos Tavares, have gotten tens of millions of dollars in compensation packages in recent years. The companies' shareholders have been rewarded with dividends and share buybacks.
Unions "are not going to have a lot of patience for sob stories," said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars.com, an online marketplace.
Adjusted for inflation, wages for autoworkers in the United States have fallen 19 percent since 2008, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning research group.
At the same time, union officials are aware of the changes in the industry and have said they do not want to handicap G.M., Ford and Stellantis as the companies try to recover ground they have lost to Tesla, which has aggressively resisted attempts to unionize its factories. The Detroit carmakers also face challengers like Rivian, a start-up that makes electric pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in Illinois, as well as foreign-owned rivals like Mercedes-Benz and Toyota, whose U.S. factories, mostly in the South, are not unionized.
"That's the biggest challenge here," Mr. Brauer added, "trying to commit to a long-term contract in an industry that is very uncertain and unpredictable over the next five years."
Union supporters say it would be wrong to blame workers if the traditional carmakers cannot compete with Tesla and other rivals.
"If you look at the breakdown at what it costs to build an E.V., labor is a very small part of the equation. Batteries are the most," Ms. Janis of Jobs to Move America said. "This idea that the U.A.W. is going to price Ford, G.M. and Stellantis out of the market is not true."
But other analysts said that a long work stoppage could help Tesla and foreign automakers gain ground on G.M., Ford and Stellantis.
"If something happens to disrupt their business, does that give a leg up to the emerging electric vehicle makers?" said Steve Patton, who overseas the consulting firm EY's work with auto companies. "Who stands to benefit if there is a protracted strike?"

A battle between Detroit carmakers and the United Auto Workers union, which escalated Friday with targeted strikes in three locations, is unfolding amid a once-in-a-century technological upheaval that poses huge risks for both the companies and the union.
The strike has come as the traditional automakers invest billions to develop electric vehicles while still making most of their money from gasoline-driven cars. The negotiations will determine the balance of power between workers and management, possibly for years to come. That makes the strike as much a struggle for the industry’s future as it is about wages, benefits and working conditions.
The established carmakers — General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, Jeep and Ram — are trying to defend their profits and their place in the market in the face of stiff competition from Tesla and foreign automakers. Some executives and analysts have characterized what is happening in the industry as the biggest technological transformation since Henry Ford’s moving assembly line started up at the beginning of the 20th century.
Nearly 13,000 UAW workers walked off the job at three plants in Ohio, Michigan and Missouri on Friday after talks between the unions and the companies in three separate negotiations failed to result in agreements before a Thursday deadline. Pay is one of the biggest sticking points: The union is demanding a 40% pay increase over four years; the automakers have offered roughly half as much.
But the talks are about more than pay. Workers are trying to defend jobs as manufacturing shifts from internal combustion engines to batteries. Because they have fewer parts, electric cars can be made with fewer workers than gasoline vehicles. A favorable outcome for the UAW would also give the union a strong calling card if, as some expect, it then tries to organize employees at Tesla and other nonunion carmakers like Hyundai, which is planning to manufacture electric vehicles at a massive new factory in Georgia.
“The transition to EVs is dominating every bit of this discussion,” said John Casesa, senior managing director at investment firm Guggenheim Partners who previously headed strategy at Ford Motor.
“It's unspoken,” Casesa added. “But really, it’s all about positioning the union to have a central role in the new electric industry.”
Under pressure from government officials and changing consumer demand, Ford, GM and Stellantis are investing billions to retool their sprawling operations to build electric vehicles, which are critical to addressing climate change. But they are making little if any profit on those vehicles while Tesla, which dominates electric car sales, is profitable and growing fast.
Ford said in July that its electric vehicle business would lose $4.5 billion this year. If the union got all the increases in pay, pensions and other benefits it is seeking, the company said, its workers’ total compensation would be twice as much as Tesla’s employees.
Union demands would force Ford to scrap its investments in electric vehicles, Jim Farley, the company’s CEO, said in an interview Friday. “We want to actually have a conversation about a sustainable future,” he said, “not one that forces us to choose between going out of business and rewarding our workers.”
For workers, the biggest concern is that electric vehicles have far fewer parts than gasoline models and will render many jobs obsolete. Plants that make mufflers, catalytic converters, fuel injectors and other components that electric cars don’t need will have to be overhauled or shut down.
Many new battery and electric vehicle factories are springing up and could employ workers from the plants that have shut down. But automakers are building most aggressively in the South, where labor laws are tilted against union organizers, rather than in the Midwest, where the UAW has more clout. One of the union’s demands is that workers in the new factories be covered by the automakers’ national labor contracts — a demand that the automakers have said they can’t meet because those plants are owned by joint ventures. The union also wants to regain the right to strike to block plant shutdowns.
“We are at the dawn of another industrial revolution, and the way we’re going is the way we went in the last industrial revolution — a lot of profit for a few and misery and not good jobs for the many,” said Madeline Janis, executive director of Jobs to Move America, an advocacy group that works closely with the UAW and other unions.

Biden Says He Will Nominate a Former F.A.A. Deputy to Lead the Agency: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The News
President Biden announced on Thursday that he planned to nominate Michael G. Whitaker, who served as the No. 2 official at the Federal Aviation Administration during the Obama administration, to become the agency's next permanent leader.
Mr. Whitaker currently serves as the chief operating officer for Supernal, a Hyundai Motor company that is developing air taxis. He was the F.A.A.'s deputy administrator from 2013 to 2016 and has also been an executive at United Airlines.
Why It Matters: The F.A.A. has lacked a permanent leader for 17 months.
The F.A.A. has been without permanent leadership since Stephen Dickson, a former Delta Air Lines executive and an appointee of President Donald J. Trump, stepped down last year.
Mr. Biden's first nominee for the post, Phillip A. Washington, the chief executive of Denver International Airport, withdrew from consideration in March after running into resistance in the Senate.
The failure of Mr. Washington's nomination has prolonged the leadership void atop the agency. The F.A.A. official who served as acting administrator after Mr. Dickson's departure, Billy Nolen, left the agency in June.
Polly Trottenberg, the deputy transportation secretary, has been serving as the F.A.A.'s acting administrator, but she will have to turn over the reins to another temporary leader in late October because of a federal law that limits how long she can run the agency on an acting basis.
Background: It's been a bumpy stretch for the airline industry.
Mr. Whitaker would take the helm of the F.A.A. at an eventful time.
Travelers have flocked to the skies as the coronavirus pandemic has receded, and a series of near collisions around the country has raised concerns about safety. A New York Times investigation published last month found that near misses involving commercial airliners have been happening far more frequently than previously known.
Passengers have also endured a string of delays and cancellations, including when an F.A.A. system outage in January forced a halt to flights nationwide.
In Washington, Congress faces a Sept. 30 deadline to reauthorize the F.A.A., giving lawmakers an opportunity to leave their imprint on the nation's aviation policies. The House passed a bill in July that would reauthorize the agency for the next five years, but the Senate has yet to act. Lawmakers may end up passing an extension to buy themselves more time.
What's Next: The Senate will consider the nomination.
Mr. Whitaker's nomination will go before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, the panel where Mr. Washington's nomination ran aground.
Mr. Washington had spent most of his career in the Army and at transit agencies, and Republicans senators painted him as unqualified to lead the F.A.A. But Mr. Whitaker has a long résumé in the aviation industry, so he is likely to fare better on that front. A lawyer by training, he became certified as a private pilot during his stint as the F.A.A.'s deputy administrator.
"America needs a confirmed F.A.A. administrator, and Mike Whitaker is the right leader for the job," Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement. "He knows aviation, he knows safety, he knows the F.A.A. and he knows how to manage and modernize large organizations."
Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the top Republican on the Commerce Committee, was noncommittal about the president's selection.
"After several near misses, chronic air traffic controller staffing shortages and ongoing problems with implementing new technology at the F.A.A.," Mr. Cruz said in a statement, "we must carefully evaluate Mike Whitaker's qualifications, experience and temperament to determine whether he is the right person to lead the agency at this critical juncture."

U.S. to Recall A Key Part For Airbags: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The action covers airbags made by two companies and used by 12 automakers from 2000 to 2018. The parts were linked to seven injuries and one death.
Federal auto safety regulators moved Tuesday toward a recall of about 52 million airbag inflaters used by a dozen major carmakers, calling the parts unsafe and susceptible to rupture.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration scheduled a public meeting on Oct. 5 on its recommendation to recall the airbags, manufactured by ARC Automotive and Delphi Automotive Systems. ARC rejected the agency's initial findings that its airbags were defective.
The agency said that at least seven people had been injured and one killed in seven incidents in the United States as a result of the defective airbags.
Of the 52 million airbags, 41 million were manufactured by ARC and 11 million were produced by Delphi using a design licensed by ARC. The airbags were variously made in China, Mexico and Knoxville, Tenn., and were used by a dozen major carmakers: BMW, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Stellantis, Tesla, Toyota and Volkswagen.
"An airbag inflater that fails by rupture not only does not perform its job as a safety device, but instead actively threatens injury or death, even in a crash where the vehicle occupants would otherwise have been unharmed," the agency said in its announcement.
ARC and Delphi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The ARC matter comes several years after the safety agency's investigation of inflaters made by Takata, a Japanese supplier, that were found to explode violently and suddenly, even when the airbags were not deployed in a crash. In that case, regulators determined that Takata used a propellant that could break down over time from exposure to humidity.
The safety agency linked the Takata defect to more than a dozen deaths in the United States. More than 70 million vehicles equipped with Takata inflaters were recalled in more than 40 countries.
In April, the safety agency demanded in a letter to ARC that the company recall tens of millions of airbag inflaters that were made from 2000 to 2018.
The agency's investigators found that a small number of inflaters designed by ARC could explode more violently than intended when a vehicle's airbags are deployed, and therefore "pose an unreasonable risk of death or injury," the letter said.
The letter prompted G.M. to recall nearly one million vehicles made from 2014 to 2017 and equipped with ARC inflaters. The automaker said it was taking the action "out of an abundance of caution."
In response to the agency's demand, ARC declined to issue a recall and said in a letter in May that it did not believe a defect existed and that in its view NHTSA's finding was not based on "any objective technical or engineering conclusion."
Inflaters use an explosive substance such as ammonium nitrate that is compacted into tablets stored in a metal cylinder. In a crash severe enough to set off a vehicle's airbags, the tablets are supposed to create a controlled explosion that rapidly fills the airbags with gas.
The safety agency said it had found that ARC's manufacturing process could leave bits of welding material, known as weld slag, inside the cylinder. If the airbags are deployed, that material could clog the exit opening and cause an explosion violent enough to blast shards of metal and plastic into the vehicle's interior.
The agency has been looking at ARC inflaters since 2015. The most recent incident involving a rupture occurred in Michigan in March, when the driver of a 2017 Chevrolet Traverse sustained facial injuries.
ARC, in its letter to regulators in May, said that weld slag had been ruled out as the cause of two of the seven incidents noted by the agency, and that it had not yet been found definitively to be the cause of the other five.
A large-scale recall, and any related legal expenses, could have considerable costs for the inflater makers. After the Takata recall, the largest in automotive history, which forced it to pay millions of dollars in fines to U.S. regulators, the company filed for bankruptcy in 2017 and was sold to Joyson Safety Systems, formerly known as Key Safety Systems.
Takata had been responsible for the cost of replacing the defective inflaters -- a task handled by local car dealerships -- but the bankruptcy filing left automakers to pick up the bill. About 11 percent of the affected airbags still haven't been replaced, according to the safety agency's most recent estimate.
The agency has come under scrutiny for its investigations of vehicle defects. In May the Department of Transportation's inspector general issued a report concluding that the agency's Office of Defects Investigations did not identify and investigate safety defects in a timely manner.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In a recent analysis of data from 37 American cities, the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, suggested a hopeful trend -- the pandemic-era spike in crime may have peaked. The homicide rate has dropped significantly over the last year, based on data from 30 American cities. In many places, just about all types of violent crimes are down, in some areas substantially -- in Atlanta, for instance, there have been 21 percent fewer aggravated assaults, 28 percent fewer homicides and 56 percent fewer rapes than at this point in 2022, according to police department data.
But there's a glaring exception: auto thefts. According to the Council on Criminal Justice, "The number of vehicle thefts during the first half of 2023 was 33.5 percent higher, on average, than during the same period in 2022 -- representing 23,974 more vehicle thefts in the cities that reported data." In Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Chicago, New Orleans, Buffalo and Durham, N.C., motor vehicle thefts this year have more than doubled relative to last year, according to stats collected by Jeff Asher, a crime data analyst. This week, The Baltimore Sun reported that "auto thefts are on pace to more than double the total from last year, as reports through the first eight months of 2023 are already up 88 percent compared to all of 2022."
Why are so many cars getting stolen? Police departments and city officials point to this: Millions of Kias and Hyundais are ridiculously easy to steal.
For years now, most automakers have equipped most of the cars they sell in the United States with electronic immobilizers, devices that prevent cars from starting unless they detect a radio ID code associated with the car's rightful key. But Hyundai and Kia, which come under the same South Korean conglomerate, did not install this basic device in somewhere around nine million cars sold between 2011 and 2022. A couple of years ago, videos showing how to hotwire the vulnerable cars began to pop up online. I won't go into details but I will say that it doesn't require much more than a USB plug.
The resulting crime wave has clobbered American cities. "We're hitting close to 6,000 cars that have been stolen this year alone," Adrian Diaz, Seattle's police chief, told me. More than a third of the cars stolen in Seattle in August were Hyundais and Kias, he said. "That's a massive cost, not only for the victim of having a vehicle stolen," but also in resources involved in "trying to investigate these crimes," Diaz said.
And then there are the follow-on incidents. Stolen Kias and Hyundais have been involved in numerous deadly crashes, armed robbery sprees and other crimes around the country. "We're recovering guns out of a lot of Kias that are stolen," Diaz said.
Seattle is one of several cities that are suing Kia and Hyundai, and they make a compelling case. The carmakers should have known they were creating unsafe products. The costs of their decision have had far-reaching effects on public safety and city resources, and there's no telling when the thefts might abate. Kia and Hyundai, not the public, should bear the cost of their irresponsible decision to sell cars without immobilizers.
The carmakers say they're doing all they can to stem the thefts. They've created a software update that they say fixes the issue; it requires a visit to a dealer and takes up to 45 minutes to install. They've also given police departments anti-theft steering wheel locks to hand out to affected owners, they say. So far, about 21 percent of affected cars -- about 660,000 Kias and 811,000 Hyundais -- have had the software upgrade installed, the carmakers said. (After you get the upgrade, the carmakers will give you a window sticker to alert thieves that they're wasting their time with your ride -- a good idea, I guess, though it does place a lot of faith in the integrity of would-be criminals.) The companies have also settled a $ 200 million lawsuit with owners of the vulnerable cars (though a federal judge recently rejected the settlement, ruling that it may not offer enough compensation for some drivers). A Kia spokesman told me that the cities' lawsuits are "without merit," arguing that federal auto safety regulators do not require automakers to install immobilizers in their vehicles. (A lawsuit filed by several insurance companies disputes this point.)
It may also be difficult for cities to prove that the rise in thefts is primarily Kia and Hyundai's fault. Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist who is one of the authors of the Council on Criminal Justice's analysis, told me that motor vehicle theft is an under-researched phenomenon. Many police departments do not "code" the make and model of stolen cars, so it's difficult to make long-term comparisons. "I cannot tell you what fraction of all motor vehicles that are stolen are Kias and Hyundais," he said.
But stats released by some of the worst affected cities strongly suggest that thefts of Kias and Hyundais are a major part of the recent spike. In the first half of 2022, according to the Chicago mayor's office, there were about 500 stolen Kias and Hyundais in Chicago. In the second half of 2022, the number of stolen Kias and Hyundais shot up to 8,350; this year, more than half of the cars stolen in Chicago were from these two brands. In August, Cleveland.com reported that Kias and Hyundais made up 57 percent of cars stolen this year, compared to 11 percent during the same period last year. In May, the Baltimore mayor's office announced the city's suit against the carmakers, reporting that Kias and Hyundais accounted for 41 percent of the cars stolen up to that point this year. (Hyundai and Kia accounted for just over 10 percent of the cars sold in America in the first quarter of this year, according to the research firm Cox Automotive.)
There's a chance that Kia and Hyundai will escape some of the blame for these thefts because there's a juicier target for politicians to go after: social media platforms, where the how-to videos have circulated.
Media accounts of the thefts often highlight TikTok's role; one Insider story was headlined "Grand Theft TikTok." In March, Eric Adams, the mayor of New York, held a news conference to discuss the city's response to the rise in stolen cars. After pointing out the steps Hyundai and Kia have taken to prevent the thefts, he went after tech companies. "We don't need social media to contribute to social disorder," he said. The same month, Representative Joe Morelle, a New York Democrat, told reporters, "We don't need companies like TikTok playing an active role in facilitating these crimes and putting information on how-to videos for people who would misuse them."
This strikes me as bizarre blame shifting. It's Kia and Hyundai, not TikTok, that sold theft-prone cars. I'm not against tech companies moderating their platforms to curb the spread of potentially dangerous information. But you know what would be better? Making cars that can't be stolen with a USB cable.

Getting Vaccines Is Key As Other Viruses Swirl: [National Desk]

Full text: Good morning. We offer a guide to fall vaccine shots -- and also have the latest on the Proud Boys, Mitch McConnell and the British Museum.
A vaccine clinic at Seattle Children's Hospital last year.Jovelle Tamayo for The New York TimesWhether over whenCovid cases have risen. Flu season is approaching. And new vaccines for the virus known as R.S.V. recently became available.
This swirl of developments has left many people wondering which vaccine shots they should be getting and when. Today's newsletter offers a guide.
The main message that I heard from experts is that Americans should shift how they think about respiratory viruses. For the past few cold-weather seasons (which are also when viruses spread most), we obsessed over Covid. This year, we should take a broader approach. "It's not only Covid you have to think about," said Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine expert and the author of a forthcoming book, "The Deadly Rise of Anti-Science."
The good news is that there are vaccines and treatments that reduce risks from all major viruses likely to circulate this season, including Covid. "For the past couple of seasons, the notion was that Covid controlled us," Dr. Nirav Shah, the C.D.C.'s principal deputy director, told me. "The tables have turned, not just for Covid but for the others."
1. R.S.V.
The most immediate step worth considering involves R.S.V., which stands for respiratory syncytial virus. It is a common winter virus that usually causes mild cold-like illness but can be dangerous for young children and older adults, as Emily Martin, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan, has told The Times.
This spring, the federal government approved the first R.S.V. vaccines, for people aged 60 and older. If you qualify, consider getting your R.S.V. vaccine shot now. Shah, the C.D.C. official, recently urged his mother to do so. Hotez, who's 65, has received his own R.S.V. shot.
Why now? R.S.V. tends to circulate somewhat earlier than the flu. If you're 60 or over, "you don't want to get into November without having an R.S.V. vaccine," said Dr. Ashish Jha, the former White House Covid adviser and current dean of Brown University's public health school.
What about infants? Although there is no R.S.V. vaccine for them, children under 8 months (and some who are older) can receive an advance antibody treatment to prevent severe illness. Parents may want to ask their pediatrician about it. It's sufficiently new that not all doctors have it yet.
2. Influenza
The flu officially kills about 35,000 Americans in a typical year, and the true toll is probably higher. As Jha told me, the flu also weakens the body in ways that make heart attacks and strokes more common, especially among the elderly. "We underestimate the impact that respiratory viruses have on our population," he said. "The flu can knock people out for weeks, even younger people."
Yet the flu's toll would be lower if more people got a vaccine shot. In recent years, less than half of Americans have done so.
This year's flu vaccine shots are now available at drugstores, hospitals, doctor's offices and elsewhere. You may want to wait until late September or October to get one, though. The heaviest parts of flu season tend to occur between December and February. If you wait, the shot's protection against severe illness will still be near its strongest level during those months.
3. Covid
The best defenses against Covid haven't changed: vaccines and post-infection treatments. They are especially important for vulnerable people, like the elderly and the immunocompromised. "Overwhelmingly, those who are being hospitalized are unvaccinated or undervaccinated," Hotez said.
The federal government is on track to approve updated Covid vaccine shots, designed to combat recent variants, in mid-September. Once it does, all adults should consider getting a booster shot. Many Americans have now gone more than a year without one, and immunity has waned.
Yes, severe Covid remains rare in people under 50, especially if they have received a vaccine shot or had the virus -- and nearly all Americans fall into one or both categories. But Covid can still be nasty even if it doesn't put you in the hospital. A booster shot will reduce its potency.
Shah argues that children (over 6 months old) should also get a Covid shot this fall, even though their own Covid risk is very low. "We should be thinking bigger than just ourselves," he told me. "Do you want to see your grandpa? Do you want to hang out with your grandma? Are you really sure you're not going to give Covid to them?" Even some boosted older people get severe versions of Covid.
A good strategy for many people may be to get their Covid booster and flu shot at the same time, in late September or October.
And if you're older and you get Covid, talk to a doctor about taking Paxlovid or a different treatment. It can make a big difference. "When I get Covid," said Jha, who's 52 and healthy, "I have every intention of taking Paxlovid."
The bottom lineI've offered specific advice here about the ideal time to get different vaccine shots. But don't exaggerate the importance of timing. As Shah said, "What I care more about is that you get all three shots if you're eligible rather than when you get all three."
Politics
Donald Trump pleaded not guilty in the Georgia criminal case over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, waiving an in-person arraignment.Justice Clarence Thomas formally disclosed private flights, luxury trips and a real estate transaction with Harlan Crow, a billionaire conservative donor.A former Proud Boys leader received a 17-year prison sentence for plotting to attack the Capitol."We need 50 million bucks": With Ron DeSantis lagging Trump, the chief strategist of DeSantis's super PAC made an urgent plea to donors.Mitch McConnellCongress's attending physician called Senator Mitch McConnell "medically clear" to work after he froze up at a news conference for a second time.Three senators named John -- Thune, Cornyn and Barrasso -- are among the possible successors if McConnell steps down as Republican leader.
War in Ukraine
Small Ukrainian advances like retaking the village of Robotyne are providing a morale boost for both Ukrainian troops and the public. New Russian high school textbooks seek to justify the war.
International
The building in Johannesburg where at least 74 people died in a fire was a refuge for desperate families seeking an affordable place to live. Pope Francis landed in Mongolia, home to fewer than 1,500 Catholics but bordering China and Russia, whose leaders have thwarted his ambitions.

Hyundai and LG Planning Infusion for Georgia Plant
Hyundai and LG Energy Solution said Thursday that they would spend an additional $ 2 billion and hire an extra 400 workers to make batteries at the automaker's electrical vehicle plant that's under construction in Georgia. The announcement by the South Korea-based companies expands on a partnership they began three months ago to produce batteries at the same site west of Savannah where Hyundai plans to start E.V. production in 2025. The news brings the companies' total investment in the Georgia plant to more than $ 7.5 billion and the site's overall planned work force to 8,500. It's not clear whether the additional investment and jobs announced Thursday mean the Hyundai/LG battery plant will produce more batteries. When the joint venture was first announced in May, the companies said they would supply batteries for 300,000 E.V.s a year. Hyundai has said the Georgia plant could later expand to build 500,000 vehicles annually. ASSOCIATED PRESS

J.C. Penney Will Spend $ 1 Billion on Upgrades
J.C. Penney said Thursday that it planned to spend more than $ 1 billion by the end of 2025 in a bid to revive the storied 121-year-old department store chain. The money is going toward remodeling stores, upgrading its online shopping site and app, and making its supply network more efficient. Under the plan, checkout stations that had been located throughout J.C. Penney's stores will be replaced with a single area of cashiers. Store employees will be equipped with mobile devices to scan inventory and ring up shoppers' purchases. And the chain is making upgrades to its Wi-Fi networks to speed up instore connections. The chain, which emerged from Chapter 11 reorganization in December 2020, targets budget-conscious families, whose median income ranges from $ 50,000 to $ 75,000 and who have been hit hard by higher costs basic items and high interest rates, making borrowing on credit cards and taking out a mortgage more expensive.

Microsoft Unravels Bundle To Head Off E.U. Action
Microsoft said on Thursday that it would stop packaging its Teams videoconferencing app with its Office software in Europe in an effort to head off antitrust penalties by regulators. It also said it would take steps to make it easier for competing products to work alongside its software. The announcement comes a month after the European Union's executive Commission, the 27-nation bloc's top competition enforcer, opened a formal investigation over concerns that bundling Teams with Office gives the company an unfair edge. The investigation was triggered by a complaint filed in 2020 by Slack Technologies, maker of popular workplace messaging software. Slack, owned by business software maker Salesforce, argued that Microsoft was abusing its market dominance to eliminate competition by illegally combining Teams with its Office suite, which includes Word, Excel and Outlook.

Union's Actions in Georgia Aim to Raise the Heat On Biden and Automakers: [National Desk]

Author: Weisman, Jonathan

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A coalition of unions and civic groups is pushing one of the world's largest automakers to protect and train workers in return for federal money under President Biden's signature laws.
A coalition of labor unions and civic groups in Georgia and Alabama will launch a pressure campaign on Monday targeting Hyundai's electric vehicle plants and its clean energy suppliers, an effort that could also push the Biden administration to make good on its oft-repeated pledge to create not just jobs but "good union jobs."
By focusing on the shift to electric vehicles at Hyundai, a nonunion carmaker expected to reap huge benefits from Mr. Biden's prized initiatives, the coalition hopes to make inroads at other automakers, such as B.M.W. in South Carolina and Mercedes-Benz in Alabama, which similarly chose union-hostile territory for their American manufacturing bases.
The campaign could also raise the heat on domestic automakers in the middle of contract negotiations with the newly aggressive United Automobile Workers union, which is focused on raising wages at electric vehicle suppliers like battery makers.
For Mr. Biden, the Hyundai campaign has political ramifications, in setting specific demands on one of the largest automakers in the world in one of the most important swing states in the 2024 presidential election, Georgia.
"The people in the community should be able to come to work in these plants, with a livable wage and good jobs," said Yvonne T. Brooks, president of the Georgia State A.F.L.-C.I.O., adding that "to bring jobs here but not provide a livable wage kind of defeats the purpose."
Mr. Biden has campaigned on the sheer number of jobs created by his three signature laws, a $ 1 trillion infrastructure package, a $ 280 billion measure to rekindle a domestic semiconductor industry, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which included $ 370 billion for clean energy to combat climate change. A $ 25 million advertising blitz announced by his campaign last week kicked off with a one-minute spot that proclaims, "Manufacturing jobs are coming home," and "America is leading the world in clean energy."
But despite low unemployment, tempering inflation and steady job creation, Mr. Biden's overall approval ratings have been dragged down by voters' refusal to give him credit for the good economic news. Clifford Young, who oversees U.S. public opinion research at Ipsos, a polling company, said that last year's 8.5 percent inflation and the ensuing interest rate hikes and slower economic growth might have sealed Mr. Biden's fate with the voting public.
"The dirty secret is a bad economy hurts a president more than a good economy helps," he said.
White House officials, who were notified of the Hyundai effort ahead of time, said Thursday that Mr. Biden fully backs the aims of the coalition in Georgia. And labor leaders have generally supported Mr. Biden as the most pro-union president ever.
But in a notable shift, those leaders also say the volume of jobs created on his watch may not be enough to win worker loyalties if those jobs are low-paid, dangerous and insecure. That is especially true if substandard jobs are underwritten by the taxpayer.
"I know the president can't make stipulations that all new jobs have to go to union workers, but there have to be fair labor standards for jobs that are supported by tax dollars," said David Green, the United Automobile Workers' regional director for Ohio and Indiana. "Members are a little frustrated with it. It's our tax dollars, too."
Such concerns have led the U.A.W. to withhold its endorsement of Mr. Biden as the union's new leadership threatens to strike over wages and benefits at electric vehicle suppliers. Mr. Biden has responded with support, tapping a senior adviser and Democratic veteran, Gene B. Sperling, as liaison between the union and the automakers and backing the U.A.W. this month in contract negotiations.
But union leaders are worried about the transition that Mr. Biden has set in motion with his push to address climate change with federal money funding the shift from fossil fuels. They are pressing automakers shifting to electric vehicles to "honor the right to organize," take necessary steps to avoid plant closings, and provide training programs to help workers transition into new jobs at comparable wages.
A letter to the chief executive of Hyundai's American subsidiary, José Muñoz, signed by coalition members including the U.A.W., the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (which is particularly close to Mr. Biden), and religious, community and environmental groups, maps key labor demands.
Such letters, demanding "community benefits agreements" enforced with binding arbitration systems, have been trotted out in the past to little effect. But union leaders said the Hyundai effort is more focused and forward-looking, hinting at the strategy of organizers in the South as unions across the country have become much more aggressive.
The letter pushes for Hyundai and its subsidiaries to hire locally, train workers from the communities around the plants, bolster safety standards, and protect the environment around the plants, which are expected to employ more than 30,000 Georgians and Alabamians. Of those, 12,750 are expected to work at or around Hyundai's new electric vehicle "megasite" in Bryan County near Savannah, the largest economic development project in Georgia's history.
The coalition is seeking a binding agreement modeled on one reached last year with the electric bus maker New Flyer, which promised, among other things, that at least 45 percent of new hires and 20 percent of promotions would be women, minorities and U.S. military veterans.
"These facilities will transform our communities, and we are faced with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to ensure that this transformation is for the best," the coalition wrote, demanding that Hyundai and its suppliers come to the bargaining table to make "highroad commitments to workers and their communities."
A spokesman for Hyundai U.S.A., Michael Stewart, said in a statement that the company's "top priority is the safety and well-being of the more than 114,000 individuals we employ, directly and indirectly, whose market-leading skills and expertise are driving America's auto industry forward."
Daniel Flippo, director of the United Steelworkers southeast district, cautioned that community agreements might not have the teeth of union contracts.
At a recent meeting with Energy Department officials about the electric vehicle transition, Mr. Flippo said, he told them, "Look, all this going in to protect workers and worker rights looks good on paper, but if you don't follow up, it shouldn't be up to the union organizers to do it for you."
Democrats secured a raft of provisions in Mr. Biden's three signature laws to encourage labor organizing, raise wages and favor union apprenticeships and training programs. In May, the administration used those provisions to apply pressure to a Georgia electric bus company, Blue Bird, and support workers trying to unionize its Fort Valley, Ga., plant. The United Steelworkers won that vote.
Mr. Flippo credited a rule in the electric school bus grants that said no federal money could be used to oppose union organizing, such as in hiring union-busting law firms during an organizing drive.
"They did use some of those tactics," he said, "but all we had to say was we were going to notify the government and request an audit of where their money was going, and it went away."
The Biden administration has had some successes with clean energy companies, securing commitments by a Danish wind energy giant to use union labor on its offshore wind projects and by a North Dakota metals company to stay neutral in any union drive at its new battery plant.
But union leaders have only so much influence over the rank and file -- and against the pull of Donald J. Trump, who has made working-class appeals central to his political movement. Mr. Green pointed to the former president's promise to revive a General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, by enticing an untested start-up to buy the facility. That start-up, Lordstown Motors, filed for bankruptcy protection in late June.
"I will not, could not support any endorsement of Donald Trump," he said. "But we've got a lot of members. Do I think that Trump's rhetoric is contagious among our members? Absolutely."

Full text: By David Leonhardt and Ian Prasad Philbrick
Good morning. We're covering Biden's focus on health costs, story B and story C.
Dr. Spend Less
As his re-election effort gets underway, President Biden is signaling that health care -- and particularly the cost of it -- will be central to his campaign.
"We're taking on powerful interests to bring your health care costs down," he has said. "I'm just tired of seeing Americans ripped off," he said last month. Tomorrow, he will hold an event at the White House at which he is expected to announce the first 10 drugs that will be part of a new program in which Medicare officials can negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to reduce drug prices.
Biden is emphasizing the cost of health care partly because it has been one of his administration's biggest priorities, even if other policies -- such as those on the climate and infrastructure -- receive more attention. His administration has reduced the cost of hearing aids, reduced the cost of health insurance for people who buy it though an Obamacare exchange and reduced an array of expenses for Medicare recipients.
"Millions of people benefit from the health care provisions," Larry Levitt, an executive vice president at KFF, a health care research group, told us. Some people, he added, will save "a lot of money."
Biden and his aides understand that these policies are popular with swing voters, who, as this newsletter has described before, tend to lean left on economic issues while being more conservative on many social issues. That's particularly true of swing voters who don't have a four-year college degree. The president has described his health care policies as part of "Bidenomics in action."
"If you look at the polling data, it's overwhelmingly popular, what we've proposed," Biden said earlier this year. "Matter of fact, it's a hell of a lot more popular than I am."
Today's newsletter delves into the specifics -- and some of the criticisms -- of Biden's health care agenda.
The Medicare provisions
The Inflation Reduction Act -- a law that Biden signed last year, centered on clean-energy funding -- also includes measures to lower drug costs for Medicare recipients. Virtually every American age 65 and older is on Medicare, and many will save hundreds of dollars a year in out-of-pocket expenses. Those who spend the most on drugs will likely save a few thousand dollars a year, according to KFF.
Where do those savings comes from?
■ As of this past January, the law caps a Medicare recipient's out-of-pocket spending on insulin at $ 35 per month. The cap will save about 1.5 million Americans almost $ 500 a year on average.
■ A provision allows Medicare recipients to receive some vaccines, like those for shingles and tetanus, at no charge.
■ The law caps a recipient's total spending on prescription drugs at $ 2,000 a year, although the provision will not take effect until 2025, after the upcoming presidential campaign.
■ The law penalizes pharmaceutical companies that increase drug prices faster than the overall rate of inflation; in recent years, half of the drugs Medicare covered would have qualified. The law also includes the policy that allows Medicare officials to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to reduce prices.
Those last couple of provisions will probably have a bigger effect on the government's health care spending than on household spending. But less government spending still benefits Americans in the long run by reducing the need for taxes.
Beyond Medicare
People under 65 don't benefit as much from Biden's agenda, but many do benefit to some degree:
■ The Inflation Reduction Act increased tax subsidies for Americans who get health insurance through the Obamacare exchanges. More than 13 million people will each save about $ 800 a year on average. The policy is temporary, expiring in 2026.
■ An executive order that Biden signed in 2021 led the F.D.A. to allow drugstores and other retailers to sell hearing aids over the counter. The change reduced the cost of hearing aids by more than half. Before the change, the average cost of hearing aids was about $ 5,000.
■ Biden is trying to close some loopholes that some hospitals and insurers have used to continue sending large, unexpected bills, despite a bipartisan 2020 law, signed by Donald Trump, to prevent the practice.
Potential problems
The underlying reason for Biden's push is that Americans pay more for medical care than the citizens of any other county. There are several causes, but many experts believe that the main factor is simply that the U.S. government doesn't prevent drug companies, hospitals and insurers from charging high prices. An influential 2003 article in an academic journal made this argument bluntly in its headline: "It's the prices, stupid." These high prices translate into higher profits for health care companies.
Still, there are some potential advantages to the U.S. system. High prices create an incentive for companies to develop new drugs, some of which save lives. Four of the world's five largest drug companies are based in the U.S. The pharmaceutical industry warns that lower Medicare prices may hamper innovation, although many independent analysts -- including those at the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office -- predict any such effect will be minor.
Another possible unintended consequence is that drug companies will respond to lower Medicare prices by increasing prices for people on private insurance. If that happened, it would effectively shift money from younger Americans to older Americans, and would probably worsen economic inequality.
Most experts are also relatively sanguine about these potential downsides. But, as Levitt told us, "The truth is, we don't know."
Looking ahead: Biden has suggested that if he wins re-election, he will try to take more steps to reduce medical costs. Among them: making Obamacare subsidies permanent and capping insulin costs for privately insured Americans. "There's more to do," Biden has said.

Labor Groups Target Hyundai — and Biden — Over Transition to Electric

A coalition of labor unions and civic groups in Georgia and Alabama will launch a pressure campaign on Monday targeting Hyundai’s electric vehicle plants and its clean energy suppliers, an effort that could also push the Biden administration to make good on its oft-repeated pledge to create not just jobs but “good union jobs.”
By focusing on the shift to electric vehicles at Hyundai, a nonunion carmaker expected to reap huge benefits from Biden’s prized initiatives, the coalition hopes to make inroads at other automakers, such as BMW in South Carolina and Mercedes-Benz in Alabama, which similarly chose union-hostile territory for their U.S. manufacturing bases.
The campaign could also raise the heat on domestic automakers in the middle of contract negotiations with the newly aggressive United Automobile Workers, who are focused on raising wages at electric vehicle suppliers like battery makers.
For Biden, the Hyundai campaign has political ramifications, in setting specific demands on one of the largest automakers in the world in one of the most important swing states in the 2024 presidential election, Georgia.
“The people in the community should be able to come to work in these plants, with a livable wage and good jobs,” said Yvonne T. Brooks, president of the Georgia state AFL-CIO, adding that “to bring jobs here but not provide a livable wage kind of defeats the purpose.”
Biden has campaigned on the sheer number of jobs created by his three signature laws, a $1 trillion infrastructure package, a $280 billion measure to rekindle a domestic semiconductor industry, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which included $370 billion for clean energy to combat climate change. A $25 million advertising blitz announced by his campaign last week kicked off with a one-minute spot that proclaims, “Manufacturing jobs are coming home,” and “America is leading the world in clean energy.”
But despite low unemployment, tempering inflation and steady job creation, Biden’s overall approval ratings have been dragged down by voters’ refusal to give him credit for the good economic news. Clifford Young, who oversees U.S. public opinion research at Ipsos, a polling company, said that last year’s 8.5% inflation and the ensuing interest rate hikes and slower economic growth might have sealed Biden’s fate with the voting public.
“The dirty secret is a bad economy hurts a president more than a good economy helps,” he said.
White House officials, who were notified of the Hyundai effort ahead of time, said Thursday that Biden fully backs the aims of the coalition in Georgia. And labor leaders have generally supported Biden as the most pro-union president ever.
But in a notable shift, those leaders also say the volume of jobs created on his watch might not be enough to win worker loyalties if those jobs are low-paid, dangerous and insecure. That is especially true if substandard jobs are underwritten by the taxpayer.
“I know the president can’t make stipulations that all new jobs have to go to union workers, but there have to be fair labor standards for jobs that are supported by tax dollars,” said David Green, the United Automobile Workers’ regional director for Ohio and Indiana. “Members are a little frustrated with it. It’s our tax dollars, too.”
Such concerns have led the UAW to withhold its endorsement of Biden as the union’s new leadership threatens to strike over wages and benefits at electric vehicle suppliers. Biden has responded with support, tapping a senior adviser and Democratic veteran, Gene B. Sperling, as liaison between the union and the automakers and backing the UAW this month in contract negotiations.
But union leaders are worried about the transition that Biden has set in motion with his push to address climate change with federal money funding the shift from fossil fuels. They are pressing automakers shifting to electric vehicles to “honor the right to organize,” take necessary steps to avoid plant closings, and provide training programs to help workers transition into new jobs at comparable wages.
A letter to the chief executive of Hyundai’s American subsidiary, José Muñoz, signed by coalition members including the UAW, the AFL-CIO, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (which is particularly close to Biden), and religious, community and environmental groups, maps key labor demands.
Such letters, demanding “community benefits agreements” enforced with binding arbitration systems, have been trotted out in the past to little effect. But union leaders said the Hyundai effort is more focused and forward-looking, hinting at the strategy of organizers in the South as unions across the country have become much more aggressive.
The letter pushes for Hyundai and its subsidiaries to hire locally, train workers from the communities around the plants, bolster safety standards, and protect the environment around the plants, which are expected to employ more than 30,000 Georgians and Alabamians. Of those, 12,750 are expected to work at or around Hyundai’s new electric vehicle “megasite” in Bryan County near Savannah, the largest economic development project in Georgia’s history.
The coalition is seeking a binding agreement modeled on one reached last year with the electric bus maker New Flyer, which promised, among other things, that at least 45% of new hires and 20% of promotions would be women, minorities and U.S. military veterans.
“These facilities will transform our communities, and we are faced with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to ensure that this transformation is for the best,” the coalition wrote, demanding that Hyundai and its suppliers come to the bargaining table to make “highroad commitments to workers and their communities.”
A spokesperson for Hyundai USA, Michael Stewart, said in a statement that the company’s “top priority is the safety and well-being of the more than 114,000 individuals we employ, directly and indirectly, whose market-leading skills and expertise are driving America’s auto industry forward.”

It's a Surprisingly Speedy Shift: [SpecialSections]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The United States is pivoting away from fossil fuels and toward wind, solar and other renewable energy, even in areas dominated by the oil and gas industries.
Delivery vans in Pittsburgh. Buses in Milwaukee. Cranes loading freight at the Port of Los Angeles. Every municipal building in Houston. All are powered by electricity derived from the sun, wind or other sources of clean energy.
Across the country, a profound shift is taking place that is nearly invisible to most Americans. The nation that burned coal, oil and gas for more than a century to become the richest economy on the planet, as well as historically the most polluting, is rapidly shifting away from fossil fuels.
A similar energy transition is already well underway in Europe and elsewhere. But the United States is catching up, and globally, change is happening at a pace that is surprising even the experts who track it closely.
Wind and solar power are breaking records, and renewables are now expected to overtake coal by 2025 as the world's largest source of electricity. Automakers have made electric vehicles central to their business strategies and are openly talking about an expiration date on the internal combustion engine. Heating, cooling, cooking and some manufacturing are going electric.
As the planet registers the highest temperatures on record, rising in some places to levels incompatible with human life, governments around the world are pouring trillions of dollars into clean energy to cut the carbon pollution that is broiling the planet.
The cost of generating electricity from the sun and wind is falling fast and in many areas is now cheaper than gas, oil or coal. Private investment is flooding into companies that are jockeying for advantage in emerging green industries.
"We look at energy data on a daily basis, and it's astonishing what's happening," said Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency. "Clean energy is moving faster than many people think, and it's become turbocharged lately."
More than $ 1.7 trillion worldwide is expected to be invested in technologies such as wind, solar power, electric vehicles and batteries globally this year, according to the I.E.A., compared with just over $ 1 trillion in fossil fuels. That is by far the most ever spent on clean energy in a year.
Those investments are driving explosive growth. China, which already leads the world in the sheer amount of electricity produced by wind and solar power, is expected to double its capacity by 2025, five years ahead of schedule. In Britain, roughly one-third of electricity is generated by wind, solar and hydropower. And in the United States, 23 percent of electricity is expected to come from renewable sources this year, up 10 percentage points from a decade ago.
"The nature of these exponential curves sometimes causes us to underestimate how quickly changes occur once they reach these inflection points and begin accelerating," said former Vice President Al Gore, who called attention to what he termed a "planetary crisis" 17 years ago in his film "An Inconvenient Truth." "The trend is definitely in favor of more and more renewable energy and less fossil energy."
Even as the pace of change in the United States is surprising everyone from energy experts to automobile executives, fossil fuels still dominate energy production at home and abroad.
Corporations are building new coal mines, oil rigs and gas pipelines. The government continues to award leases for drilling projects on public lands and in federal waters and still subsidizes the industries. After posting record profits last year, leading oil companies are backing away from recent promises to invest more heavily in renewable energy.
The scale of change required to remake the systems that power the United States -- all the infrastructure that needs to be removed, re-engineered and replaced -- is mind-boggling. There are major challenges involved in adding large amounts of renewable energy to antiquated electric grids and mining enough minerals for clean technologies. Some politicians, including most Republicans, want the country to continue burning fossil fuels, even in the face of overwhelming scientific consensus that their use is endangering life on the planet. Dozens of conservative groups organized by the Heritage Foundation have created a policy playbook, should a Republican win the 2024 presidential election, that would reverse course on lowering emissions. It would shred regulations designed to curb greenhouse gases, dismantle nearly every federal clean energy program and boost the production of fossil fuels.
And while energy systems are changing fast, so is the climate. It is far from certain whether the United States and other polluting countries will do what scientists say is required to avert catastrophe: stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere by 2050. All of the investment so far has slowed the pace at which emissions are growing worldwide, but the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere is at record levels.
And yet, from Beijing to London, Tokyo to Washington, Oslo to Dubai, the energy transition is undeniably racing ahead. Change is here, even in oil country.
'Energy Is Energy'
As the workday begins in Tulsa, Okla., the assembly line at the electric school bus factory rattles to life. Crews fan out across the city to install solar panels on century-old Tudor homes. Teslas and Ford F-150 Lightnings pull up to charging stations powered in part by the country's second-largest wind farm. And at the University of Tulsa's School of Petroleum Engineering, faculty are working on ways to use hydrogen as a clean energy source.
Tulsa, a former boomtown once known as the "Oil Capital of the World" where the minor league baseball team is the Drillers, is immersed in a new energy revolution.
At the port, an Italian company, Enel, is building a $ 1 billion solar panel factory. The bus factory is operated by Navistar, one of the biggest commercial vehicle makers in the world. And the city's main electric utility, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, now harvests more than 28 percent of its power from wind.
Clean energy entrepreneurs are flocking to Oklahoma, too. Francis Energy, a fast-growing maker of electric vehicle charging stations, is based in Tulsa. Canoo, an electric vehicle start-up, is building a 100,000-square-foot battery factory at a nearby industrial park and a manufacturing plant for its trucks in Oklahoma City, though there are questions about whether the company will have enough funding to realize its plans. And teams from Solar Power of Oklahoma are busy fastening photovoltaic panels to the roofs of homes and businesses around Tulsa.
The city is embracing its shifting identity.
"We have a tremendous sense of pride in our history," said Dewey F. Bartlett Jr., the Republican former mayor of Tulsa who was an oil and gas executive but now helps recruit clean energy companies to the region. "But we also understand that energy is energy, whether it is generated by wind, steam or whatever it might be."
Around the country, clean energy is taking root in unlikely locales.
Houston, home to more than 500 oil and gas companies, also has more than 130 solar- and wind-related companies. Some of the country's largest wind and solar farms are in the Texas flatlands outside the city, and a huge wind farm has been proposed off the coast of Galveston.
In Arkansas, a planned solar farm -- the state's biggest -- is expected to help power a nearby U.S. Steel factory that is undergoing a $ 3 billion upgrade. When complete, the plant will use electric furnaces to mold scrap steel into new products. That will result in about 80 percent less greenhouse gases, the company says, and set the pace for an industry that has been a major polluter.
About two-thirds of the new investment in clean energy is in Republican-controlled states, where policymakers have historically resisted renewables. But with each passing month, the politics seem to matter less than the economics.
"We're the reddest state in the country, and we're an oil and gas state," said J.W. Peters, president of Solar Power of Oklahoma. "So it took a lot of time to convince people that this wasn't snake oil."
Mr. Peters was broke six years ago, with less than $ 400 in his checking account after his contracting business slowed down. Then he responded to a help-wanted ad looking for workers to install solar panels, which were becoming more popular in Tulsa. He now employs 61 workers and has $ 18 million in annual sales. "The environmental benefits are nice," he said, "but most people are doing this for the financial opportunity."
'Something Very Dramatic'
Fifteen years ago, solar panels, wind turbines and battery-powered vehicles were widely viewed as niche technologies, too expensive and unreliable for mainstream use.
But clean energy became cheap far faster than anyone expected. Since 2009, the cost of solar power has plunged by 83 percent, while the cost of producing wind power has fallen by more than half. The price of lithium-ion battery cells fell 97 percent over the past three decades.
Today, solar and wind power are the least expensive new sources of electricity in many markets, generating 12 percent of global electricity and rising. This year, for the first time, global investors are expected to pour more money into solar power -- some $ 380 billion -- than into drilling for oil.
The rapid drop in costs for solar energy, wind power and batteries can be traced to early government investment and steady improvements over time by hundreds of researchers, engineers and entrepreneurs around the world.
"The world has produced nearly three billion solar panels at this point, and every one of those has been an opportunity for people to try to improve the process," said Gregory Nemet, a solar power expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. "And all of those incremental improvements add up to something very dramatic."
An equally potent force, along with the technological advances, has been an influx of money -- in particular, a gusher since 2020 of government subsidies.
In the United States, President Biden signed a trio of laws during his first two years in office that allocated unprecedented funds for clean energy: A $ 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law provided money to enhance the power grid, buy electric buses for schools and build a national network of electric vehicle chargers. The bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act set aside billions of dollars for semiconductors vital to car manufacturing. And the Inflation Reduction Act, which marks its first anniversary on Aug. 16, is by far the most ambitious attempt to fight climate change in American history.
That landmark law provided tax breaks related to electric vehicles, heat pumps and energy efficiency upgrades, solar panel and wind turbine manufacturing and clean hydrogen production. The government is also investing in efforts to capture carbon emissions and store them before they can reach the atmosphere, as well as technology that can remove them directly from the air.
Originally estimated to cost roughly $ 391 billion between 2022 and 2031, the tax breaks are proving so popular with manufacturers and consumers that estimates now put the cost as high as $ 1.2 trillion over the next decade.
Combined, the three laws have prompted companies to announce at least $ 230 billion in manufacturing investments so far. In Georgia, a Korean solar manufacturer, Qcells, is building a $ 2.5 billion plant. In Nevada, Tesla is building a new $ 3.6 billion electric truck factory. And in Oklahoma, the Enel and Canoo facilities are primed to benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act, as is a new $ 4.4 billion battery factory being considered by Panasonic, the Japanese conglomerate.
"There's a lot of appetite to invest in the United States thanks to that law," said Giovanni Bertolino, an executive at Enel, adding that the plant his company is building in Tulsa would not exist without the Inflation Reduction Act.
Regulations are also hastening the energy transition. Mr. Biden has proposed tough new federal pollution limits on tailpipes and smokestacks, but several states are acting on their own. California, with market muscle that influences the entire auto industry, plans to halt sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035 and new diesel-powered trucks by 2036 -- and a handful of states are following suit. In May, New York became the first state to ban gas hookups in most new buildings, requiring all-electric heating and cooking starting in 2026. Several cities, including New York and San Francisco, have similar prohibitions, although some Republican-controlled states have blocked their municipalities from banning gas.
Heavy investment by the United States has spurred a spirited reaction from other wealthy nations. Countries that initially complained that the United States was unfairly subsidizing clean energy manufacturers have since engaged in a sort of friendly subsidy race.
Canada, South Korea and others have pushed for their companies to have better access to the American incentives, while offering similar subsidies to their domestic manufacturers. After Russia invaded Ukraine last year, the European Union moved to lessen its dependence on Russian oil and gas. In May, for the first time ever, wind and solar power in the E.U. generated more electricity than fossil fuels.
And in China, which is currently both the world's top polluter and the global leader for renewable power, the government continues to invest in every stage of clean energy production, from solar cells to batteries, wind turbines and more. Like the United States, China provides subsidies to buyers of electric vehicles. Last year it spent $ 546 billion on clean energy, far more than any other country in the world.
With costs falling fast, manufacturing has picked up and installations of solar and wind projects have increased. The U.S. solar industry installed a record 6.1 gigawatts of capacity in the first quarter of 2023, a 47 percent increase over the same period last year.
And those low costs have led many of the United States' biggest corporations, such as Alphabet, Amazon and General Motors, to purchase large amounts of wind and solar power, because it burnishes their reputations and because it makes good economic sense.
"We're seeing the nonlinear change happen before us," said Jon Creyts, chief executive of RMI, a nonprofit organization that promotes the energy transition. "And that's important, because we're facing a climate crisis right now."
'A National Phenomenon'
Steve Uerling's Tulsa home is a model of energy efficiency. He replaced all his incandescent light bulbs with LEDs. He installed a heat pump and rooftop solar panels this year. And he drives a plug-in hybrid Ford Fusion and a Tesla Model 3.
Mr. Uerling, a mechanical engineer, said he wanted to see renewable power take off in Oklahoma and was trying to do his part. But he was also driven by his wallet.
"My fuel cost is equivalent to getting 200 miles a gallon on gasoline," he said. "We charge at night, when we get a much cheaper rate on our electricity."
Millions of people around the country are making similar calculations. Electric vehicles are by far the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry, with record sales of 300,000 in the second quarter of 2023, a 48 percent increase from a year earlier. Teslas are now among the best-selling cars in the country, and Ford has expanded its production of the F-150 Lightning, the electric version of its popular pickup truck, after a surge of initial demand created a waiting list.
Concerns among consumers about the availability of charging stations as well as the cost of some models have helped to cool sales somewhat, leading some automakers to slash prices. Still, federal tax credits of up to $ 7,500 have made the least expensive electric vehicles competitive with gas-powered cars. And about two dozen states offer additional tax credits, rebates or reduced fees, further pushing down their cost.
Government action is also helping heavier vehicles go electric. Sales of electric school buses are soaring, largely because of $ 5 billion in federal grants that can cover 100 percent of the cost for low-income communities. The Postal Service plans to spend nearly $ 10 billion to purchase 66,000 electric mail trucks -- roughly 30 percent of its fleet -- over the next five years.
In the private sector, Amazon has ordered 100,000 electric delivery trucks from Rivian. Tesla has an electric semitruck, as do several other manufacturers, including Peterbilt.
Companies that provide charging stations are springing up to meet the demand. Francis Energy has more than 400 chargers across Oklahoma and is expanding nationwide. EVgo, which has one of the largest fast-charging networks in the United States, plans to more than double the 3,000 charging stalls it operates.
"It is not a red-state, blue-state thing," said Cathy Zoi, EVgo's chief executive. "It is a national phenomenon."
In an unusual move, seven carmakers -- BMW Group, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz Group and Stellantis -- are spending $ 1 billion in a joint venture to build 30,000 charging ports on major highways and other locations in the United States and Canada.
The shift is happening so quickly that some of America's most iconic automakers are preparing for a world beyond gasoline-powered cars and trucks.
General Motors, which has the largest market share of any carmaker in the United States, has committed to selling only zero-emissions vehicles by 2035. It's a "once-in-a-generation inflection point" for the 114-year-old automaker, according to Mary Barra, G.M.'s chief executive.
In an interview, Ms. Barra said her company began to consider an all-electric future in 2020. "We started to see this happening with the consumer research we did," said Ms. Barra, who has subsequently bet billions on G.M.'s efforts to reorient its engineering, overhaul its manufacturing facilities and processes and build new battery plants.
As the cost of batteries comes down, and the number of charging stations nationwide goes up, Ms. Barra expects exponential growth. "I think it's going to be definitely an upward trajectory," she said. "It'll be a little bumpy, but bumpy growing."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A moment of forgetfulness by a distracted or sleep-deprived parent can be devastating. Experts and child-safety advocates have called for interior motion sensors in all vehicles.
Ever since Tyler Cestia left his son Thomas in his truck on a hot morning in June two years ago, he has felt, he said, like a cork bobbing in the ocean.
It was June 14, 2021, and Mr. Cestia was preparing for a stressful audit at work when he forgot to drop off Thomas at the babysitter on the way to his office in New Iberia, La.
At lunchtime, he drove to a restaurant with the auditor and then back to his office.
That afternoon, it occurred to him that he didn't remember seeing the babysitter that morning. He ran to his truck where he found Thomas in his car seat behind the driver's seat. Thomas, who was 2 and a half years old, was pronounced dead at the scene.
"It was just a total utter shock," said Mr. Cestia, 37, who lives in New Iberia with his wife, Pam, and their two other children. "It's almost like a nightmare that's not real. I'm living in a makeshift world that's not real. And once you come down off that, it's a daily grind."
Mr. Cestia said he has coped with the extreme grief with help from his religious faith and therapy. He has also had the support of his wife.
"People think, 'Oh, how does somebody do that?"' Pam Cestia said. "You don't forget your cellphone. You don't forget this. But he was hyper-focused on something else. He's not a bad parent. He's not a bad father."
The aftermath in other cases has been more dire. Marriages have fallen apart. Caregivers have been prosecuted and faced prison time. In one case last year in Chesterfield, Va., a father who realized what he had done immediately went home and killed himself.
And still the deaths come. Just this week in Houston, a 3-month-old died after he was left unattended in a car, the police said. About 40 children a year die from heatstroke in cars, either because they are left in the vehicle or because they become trapped, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
That averages out to a child dying in a hot car every 10 days in the United States. The deaths are more frequent in summer but happen in every month of the year.
Child-safety advocates said that new technology could help prevent these recurring tragedies. Vehicles with interior motion sensors, for example, can sound the horn and send alerts to a driver's phone if they detect a child in the back seat after the car has been turned off.
But automakers and regulators have not made the technology standard equipment in new vehicles, frustrating safety experts. According to Kids and Car Safety, a nonprofit group, 1,050 children have died in hot cars nationwide since 1990 and at least another 7,300 have survived with varying injuries.
"It should really be embarrassing for the automakers and to the government that this has not already been taken care of," said Janette E. Fennell, the founder and president of Kids and Car Safety. "When you have the technology to prevent these deaths, and it's not expensive, what are we waiting for?"
Federal regulators said they were developing rules that would require new vehicles to have lights and chimes to remind drivers to check the back seat after they turn off a car, as required under the $ 1 trillion infrastructure law that President Biden signed in 2021. But that requirement won't take effect until 2025.
Major automakers have also pledged that by 2025 all new vehicles will include basic back-seat reminder systems. As of last October, more than 150 models offered the reminders, according to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which said in a statement that the industry was making "major progress" toward its goal of universal back-seat reminders.
But higher-tech systems that use radar or ultrasonic sensors to detect a child in the back seat remain relatively rare.
"It's a matter of cost and demand," said Emily A. Thomas, the manager of auto safety at Consumer Reports, which holds the position that child-detection systems should be standard in new vehicles. "People don't know this is what they need, so there's not a huge demand for it and, unfortunately, the auto industry responds to what's required. So if it's not required, they won't put it in as standard equipment."
About half of all hot-car deaths lead to criminal charges ranging from child endangerment to murder, according to Kids and Car Safety. Many parents and caregivers take plea deals to avoid jail time and because they are unwilling to face a court battle after the death of a child, the group said.
The psychological underpinnings of the problem have been discussed for years, at least since 2009, when Gene Weingarten of The Washington Post wrote a Pulitzer Prize-winning article exploring whether criminal charges are really appropriate for parents who accidentally kill their children by leaving them in cars.
David M. Diamond, a neuroscientist at the University of South Florida who was quoted in that story, has been patiently explaining the issue ever since, including for a documentary film, "Fatal Distraction," that was released in 2021.
Dr. Diamond said that many of the deaths happen when parents drive to work and go into "autopilot mode and lose awareness of the child in the back seat."
During the drive, the part of the brain that handles habitual behaviors like commuting "outcompetes and suppresses" the conscious memory system, which is responsible for reminding a parent to stop and drop off the child at day care, Dr. Diamond said. Stressed and sleep-deprived parents are particularly susceptible to this problem, he said.
"That's why we need technology because, frankly, we are so forgetful," Dr. Diamond said in an interview. "I try to emphasize to people that it's not negligence, it's not bad parenting, it's just part of being human."
The reminder lights and chimes installed in many newer vehicles advise drivers to check the back seat when the car is turned off. Those systems are usually triggered by a rear door being opened before or during a trip, but they cannot actually detect whether a child is in the car.
Ultrasonic sensors, found in some Kia and Hyundai vehicles, can detect a child (or a pet) moving in the back seat after a vehicle has been locked and then blow the horn and send text messages to the driver. But ultrasonic sensors may not detect a child sleeping in a rear-facing car seat, Dr. Thomas said.
Radar-based systems can purportedly detect even slight movements like the rise and fall of the chest of a child sleeping in a car seat. At least one vehicle, the Genesis GV70, features that technology.
In March, the Federal Communications Commission approved a specific frequency for short-range radar, which automakers say will make it much easier to deploy child-detecting radar inside cars. Before that, companies had to seek waivers from the F.C.C.
While radar technology is not widely available, safety advocates said that drivers could remind themselves to check the back seat by putting something important next to the child, like a purse, phone, wallet or even one of their shoes.
The Cestias have their own system. Every morning at 8:05 they text each other to make sure that their 1½-year-old was dropped off at the babysitter.
They have also spoken out strongly in favor of mandatory child-detection technology in cars.
"This is my opportunity to be Thomas's mom and to advocate for him," Pam Cestia said. "His story can help save other people's lives."

Full text: Out on the road with nowhere to plug in -- that's the greatest fear of many would-be electric vehicle buyers and why they're staying on the sidelines. And that's why a group of automakers is planning to build 30,000 fast charging points in North America.
The joint venture by seven carmakers -- BMW, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis -- would nearly double the number of fast chargers in the United States. Those chargers can replenish a drained battery in 10 to 30 minutes.
While most E.V. owners typically charge their vehicles at home overnight, they need fast charging stations for longer trips. But the chargers can be far-flung in sparsely populated areas.
At the moment, Tesla accounts for more than half the fast chargers in the United States. Last month, Ford Motor and G.M. struck a deal that would allow them to adopt Tesla's charging technology, and separately Tesla has pledged to make more of its chargers available to other car brands. The collaboration announced on Wednesday would give the automakers an option other than Tesla for charging.
Installing so many charging stations will be costly -- $ 1 billion -- and will take until the end of the decade to complete, though some chargers will be in place around the middle of next year.
But major carmakers have already invested billions to produce electric vehicles and want to ensure that the vehicles catch on. Shoring up charging infrastructure may be a necessary to getting car buyers over a major psychological hurdle.
"The better experience people have, the faster E.V. adoption will grow," said Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of G.M.
"We have to be ready to follow the data, and given how far we've come, we can afford to be a little patient as well as resolute as we let this unfold."

With the Aid of A.I., Google's Robots Get Smart: [National Desk]

Full text: Our sneak peek into Google's new robotics model, RT-2, which melds artificial intelligence technology with robots.
A one-armed robot stood in front of a table. On the table sat three plastic figurines: a lion, a whale and a dinosaur.
An engineer gave the robot an instruction: "Pick up the extinct animal."
The robot whirred for a moment, then its arm extended and its claw opened and descended. It grabbed the dinosaur.
Until very recently, this demonstration, which I witnessed during a podcast interview at Google's robotics division in Mountain View, Calif., last week, would have been impossible. Robots weren't able to reliably manipulate objects they had never seen before, and they certainly weren't capable of making the logical leap from "extinct animal" to "plastic dinosaur."
But a quiet revolution is underway in robotics, one that piggybacks on recent advances in so-called large language models -- the same type of artificial intelligence system that powers ChatGPT, Bard and other chatbots.
Google has recently begun plugging state-of-the-art language models into its robots, giving them the equivalent of artificial brains. The secretive project has made the robots far smarter and given them new powers of understanding and problem-solving.
I got a glimpse of that progress during a private demonstration of Google's latest robotics model, called RT-2. The model, which is being unveiled on Friday, amounts to a first step toward what Google executives described as a major leap in the way robots are built and programmed.
"We've had to reconsider our entire research program as a result of this change," said Vincent Vanhoucke, Google DeepMind's head of robotics. "A lot of the things that we were working on before have been entirely invalidated."
Robots still fall short of human-level dexterity and fail at some basic tasks, but Google's use of A.I. language models to give robots new skills of reasoning and improvisation represents a promising breakthrough, said Ken Goldberg, a robotics professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
"What's very impressive is how it links semantics with robots," he said. "That's very exciting for robotics."
To understand the magnitude of this, it helps to know a little about how robots have conventionally been built.
For years, the way engineers at Google and other companies trained robots to do a mechanical task -- flipping a burger, for example -- was by programming them with a specific list of instructions. (Lower the spatula 6.5 inches, slide it forward until it encounters resistance, raise it 4.2 inches, rotate it 180 degrees, and so on.) Robots would then practice the task again and again, with engineers tweaking the instructions each time until they got it right.
This approach worked for certain, limited uses. But training robots this way is slow and labor-intensive. It requires collecting lots of data from real-world tests. And if you wanted to teach a robot to do something new -- to flip a pancake instead of a burger, say -- you usually had to reprogram it from scratch.
Partly because of these limitations, hardware robots have improved less quickly than their software-based siblings. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, disbanded its robotics team in 2021, citing slow progress and a lack of high-quality training data. In 2017, Google's parent company, Alphabet, sold Boston Dynamics, a robotics company it had acquired, to the Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank. (Boston Dynamics is now owned by Hyundai and seems to exist mainly to produce viral videos of humanoid robots performing terrifying feats of agility.)
In recent years, researchers at Google had an idea. What if, instead of being programmed for specific tasks one by one, robots could use an A.I. language model -- one that had been trained on vast swaths of internet text -- to learn new skills for themselves?
"We started playing with these language models around two years ago, and then we realized that they have a lot of knowledge in them," said Karol Hausman, a Google research scientist. "So we started connecting them to robots."
Google's first attempt to join language models and physical robots was a research project called PaLM-SayCan, which was revealed last year. It drew some attention, but its usefulness was limited. The robots lacked the ability to interpret images -- a crucial skill, if you want them to be able to navigate the world. They could write out step-by-step instructions for different tasks, but they couldn't turn those steps into actions.
Google's new robotics model, RT-2, can do just that. It's what the company calls a "vision-language-action" model, or an A.I. system that has the ability not just to see and analyze the world around it, but to tell a robot how to move.
It does so by translating the robot's movements into a series of numbers -- a process called tokenizing -- and incorporating those tokens into the same training data as the language model. Eventually, just as ChatGPT or Bard learns to guess what words should come next in a poem or a history essay, RT-2 can learn to guess how a robot's arm should move to pick up a ball or throw an empty soda can into the recycling bin.
"In other words, this model can learn to speak robot," Mr. Hausman said.
In an hourlong demonstration, which took place in a Google office kitchen littered with objects from a dollar store, my podcast co-host and I saw RT-2 perform a number of impressive tasks. One was successfully following complex instructions like "move the Volkswagen to the German flag," which RT-2 did by finding and snagging a model VW Bus and setting it down on a miniature German flag several feet away.
It also proved capable of following instructions in languages other than English, and even making abstract connections between related concepts. Once, when I wanted RT-2 to pick up a soccer ball, I instructed it to "pick up Lionel Messi." RT-2 got it right on the first try.
The robot wasn't perfect. It incorrectly identified the flavor of a can of LaCroix placed on the table in front of it. (The can was lemon; RT-2 guessed orange.) Another time, when it was asked what kind of fruit was on a table, the robot simply answered, "White." (It was a banana.) A Google spokeswoman said the robot had used a cached answer to a previous tester's question because its Wi-Fi had briefly gone out.
Google has no immediate plans to sell RT-2 robots or release them more widely, but its researchers believe these new language-equipped machines will eventually be useful for more than just parlor tricks. Robots with built-in language models could be put into warehouses, used in medicine or even deployed as household assistants -- folding laundry, unloading the dishwasher, picking up around the house, they said.
"This really opens up using robots in environments where people are," Mr. Vanhoucke said. "In office environments, in home environments, in all the places where there are a lot of physical tasks that need to be done."
Of course, moving objects around in the messy, chaotic physical world is harder than doing it in a controlled lab. And given that A.I. language models frequently make mistakes or invent nonsensical answers -- which researchers call hallucination or confabulation -- using them as the brains of robots could introduce new risks.
But Mr. Goldberg, the Berkeley robotics professor, said those risks were still remote.
"We're not talking about letting these things run loose," he said. "In these lab environments, they're just trying to push some objects around on a table."
Google, for its part, said RT-2 was equipped with plenty of safety features. In addition to a big red button on the back of every robot -- which stops the robot in its tracks when pressed -- the system uses sensors to avoid bumping into people or objects.
The A.I. software built into RT-2 has its own safeguards, which it can use to prevent the robot from doing anything harmful. One benign example: Google's robots can be trained not to pick up containers with water in them, because water can damage their hardware if it spills.
If you're the kind of person who worries about A.I. going rogue -- and Hollywood has given us plenty of reasons to fear that scenario, from the original "Terminator" to last year's "M3gan" -- the idea of making robots that can reason, plan and improvise on the fly probably strikes you as a terrible idea.
But at Google, it's the kind of idea researchers are celebrating. After years in the wilderness, hardware robots are back -- and they have their chatbot brains to thank.

Plan to Double Total of Fast Chargers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The companies will jointly spend at least $ 1 billion to build a North American network in an effort to persuade more people to buy battery-powered cars and trucks.
Seven major automakers announced a plan on Wednesday to nearly double the number of fast chargers in the United States in an effort to address one of the main reasons that people hesitate to buy electric cars.
The carmakers -- BMW Group, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz Group and Stellantis -- will initially invest at least $ 1 billion in a joint venture that will build 30,000 charging ports on major highways and other locations in the United States and Canada.
The United States and Canada have about 36,000 fast chargers -- those that can replenish a drained battery in 30 minutes or less. In some sparsely populated areas, such chargers can be hundreds of miles apart. Surveys show that fear about not being able to find a charger during longer journeys is a major reason that some car buyers are reluctant to buy electric vehicles.
Sales of electric vehicles have risen quickly in the United States, but there are signs that demand is softening. As a result, Tesla, Ford Motor and other carmakers have cut prices in recent months and are offering incentives. Popular models that had long waiting lists last year are now available in a few days or weeks.
Major carmakers are investing billions of dollars to manufacture electric vehicles and batteries and to establish supplier networks. Having staked their futures on the technology, they have a strong incentive to ensure that electric vehicles catch on with car buyers.
The chargers installed by the joint venture will have plugs designed for the connections used by most carmakers other than Tesla, as well as the standard developed by Tesla that Ford, G.M. and other companies have said they intend to switch to in 2025.
"The better experience people have, the faster E.V. adoption will grow," Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, said in a statement.
The seven automakers plan to formalize the joint venture and announce its name by the end of the year, Chris Martin, a Honda spokesman, said. The first chargers will begin operating around the middle of 2024, he said, with all 30,000 in place by the end of the decade.
The joint venture is open to adding other partners, he said. Among major automakers, Ford was a notable absence from the announcement on Wednesday. The company said in a statement on Wednesday that it would continue to invest in its own network, which allows Ford owners to charge from a variety of providers with one mobile phone app.
The partnership also does not include Volkswagen. The company is a majority shareholder of Electrify America, one of the largest fast-charging providers.
Tesla accounts for more than half the fast chargers in the United States and has said it will open its networks to other car brands, though, so far, it has made fewer than 100 ports available. Owners of Ford and G.M. vehicles, among others, will be able to connect to 12,000 Tesla fast chargers using an adapter beginning next year. In 2025, Ford and G.M. plan to make models designed to take the Tesla plug without an adapter.
The decision to form the joint venture is an indication that the seven carmakers do not intend to rely solely on Tesla, which dominates sales of electric vehicles, for charging.
The chargers being built by the joint venture will be concentrated in urban areas and along major highways, especially those used most heavily by vacationers and other travelers, the companies said in a statement. Charging stations will be close to restrooms, restaurants and other amenities. The partners said they would try to take advantage of federal and state funds available for charging infrastructure.
Most electric vehicle owners charge at home and rarely need to use public chargers. Home chargers typically replenish batteries overnight. Most public chargers, about 125,000 in the United States and Canada, also operate relatively slowly -- taking four to 10 hours to do the job.
But fast chargers are important for longer trips. Fear of not being able to find one is a major psychological impediment for many would-be electric car buyers. A related problem is that many charging companies have been reluctant to build too many stations in places where few people own electric cars.
The best way to promote electric vehicle ownership, said Shay Natarajan, a partner at Mobility Impact Partners, a private equity firm in New York that focuses on transportation, would be to install chargers in states in the West, Midwest or Southeast where there aren't many, rather than in California or Eastern states that already have extensive charging networks.
Studies have found that in Norway, where almost all new cars sold are battery-powered, sales of electric cars increased steeply when fast chargers became available, Ms. Natarajan said. But the impact diminished as chargers became more commonplace.
"In states where E.V. adoption is the lowest, that is where it would make sense to build chargers," she said. "That is where you are going to have the most impact."
But even California could use more charging stations, said Cathy Zoi, the chief executive of EVgo, a Los Angeles company that builds and operates public charging stations nationwide.
"The most mature market is California, and we're not saturated in California yet," Ms. Zoi said. "Potential buyers of E.V.s are still feeling they need to see more charging stations."
The new joint venture could be a competitor to EVgo, Electrify America and other companies hoping to cash in on the growth of electric vehicles. But the carmakers may also want to tap the expertise of EVgo and others that have experience in finding suitable sites, acquiring permits and connecting to the electric grid.
EVgo has a partnership with G.M. to build fast-charging stations, and Ms. Zoi said the company was open to working with the joint venture.
An Energy Department database that maps the location of chargers highlights the gaping holes in current networks. In Minnesota, for example, fast chargers are sprinkled across the bustling Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But in the state's northern city, Duluth, home to nearly 90,000 people, there are just five fast-charging ports, four of which can charge only Tesla cars.
Fast chargers are concentrated in wealthier counties, according to a study by Bumper, an online marketplace for cars. There are also racial disparities. Counties where most residents are Black have, on average, fewer than half as many chargers per capita as white counties, according to Bumper. Native American counties have even fewer.

GM and Other Automakers Will Build 30,000 Electric Vehicle Chargers

Seven major automakers announced a plan on Wednesday to nearly double the number of fast chargers in the United States in an effort to address one of the main reasons that people hesitate to buy electric cars.
The carmakers — BMW Group, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz Group and Stellantis — will initially invest at least $1 billion in a joint venture that will build 30,000 charging ports on major highways and other locations in the United States and Canada.
The United States and Canada have about 36,000 fast chargers — those that can replenish a drained battery in 30 minutes or less. In some sparsely populated areas, such chargers can be hundreds of miles apart. Surveys show that fear about not being able to find a charger during longer journeys is a major reason that some car buyers are reluctant to buy electric vehicles.
Sales of electric vehicles have risen quickly in the United States, but there are signs that demand is softening. As a result, Tesla, Ford and other carmakers have cut prices in recent months and are offering incentives. Popular models that had long waiting lists last year are now available in a few days or weeks.
Major carmakers are investing billions of dollars to manufacture electric vehicles and batteries and to establish supplier networks. Having staked their futures on the technology, they have a strong incentive to ensure that electric vehicles catch on with car buyers.
The chargers installed by the joint venture will have plugs designed for the connections used by most carmakers other than Tesla, as well as the standard developed by Tesla that Ford, GM and other companies have said they intend to switch to in 2025.
“The better experience people have, the faster EV adoption will grow,” Mary T. Barra, the CEO of General Motors, said in a statement.
The seven automakers plan to formalize the joint venture and announce its name by the end of the year, said Chris Martin, a Honda spokesperson. The first chargers will begin operating around the middle of 2024, he said, with all 30,000 in place by the end of the decade.
The joint venture is open to adding other partners, he said. Among major automakers, Ford was a notable absence from the announcement on Wednesday. The company said in a statement on Wednesday that it would continue to invest in its own network, which allows Ford owners to charge from a variety of providers with one mobile phone app.
The partnership also does not include Volkswagen. The company is a majority shareholder of Electrify America, one of the largest fast-charging providers.
Tesla accounts for more than half the fast chargers in the United States and has said it will open its networks to other car brands, although, so far, it has only made fewer than 100 ports available. Owners of Ford and GM vehicles, among others, will be able to connect to 12,000 Tesla fast chargers using an adapter beginning next year. In 2025, Ford and GM plan to make models designed to take the Tesla plug without an adapter.
The decision to form the joint venture is an indication that the seven carmakers do not intend to rely solely on Tesla, which dominates sales of electric vehicles, for charging.
The chargers being built by the joint venture will be concentrated in urban areas and along major highways, especially those used most heavily by vacationers and other travelers, the companies said in a joint statement. Charging stations will be close to restrooms, restaurants and other amenities. The partners said they would try to take advantage of federal and state funds available for charging infrastructure.
Most electric vehicle owners charge at home and rarely need to use public chargers. Home chargers typically replenish batteries overnight. Most public chargers, about 125,000 in the United States and Canada, also operate relatively slowly — taking four to 10 hours to do the job.
But fast chargers are important for longer trips. Fear of not being able to find one is a major psychological impediment for many would-be electric car buyers. A related problem is that many charging companies have been reluctant to build too many stations in places where few people own electric cars.
The best way to promote electric vehicle ownership, said Shay Natarajan, a partner at Mobility Impact Partners, a private equity firm in New York that focuses on transportation, would be to install chargers in states in the West, Midwest or Southeast where there aren’t many, rather than in California or Eastern states that already have extensive charging networks.
Studies have found that in Norway, where almost all new cars sold are battery-powered, sales of electric cars increased steeply when fast chargers became available, Natarajan said. But the impact diminished as chargers became more commonplace.
“In states where EV adoption is the lowest, that is where it would make sense to build chargers,” she said. “That is where you are going to have the most impact.”
But even California could use more charging stations, said Cathy Zoi, the CEO of EVgo, a Los Angeles company that builds and operates public charging stations nationwide.
“The most mature market is California, and we’re not saturated in California yet,” Zoi said. “Potential buyers of EV’s are still feeling they need to see more charging stations.”
The new joint venture could be a competitor to EVgo, Electrify America and other companies hoping to cash in on the growth of electric vehicles. But the carmakers may also want to tap the expertise of EVgo and others that have experience in finding suitable sites, acquiring permits and connecting to the electric grid.
EVgo has a partnership with GM to build fast-charging stations, and Zoi said the company was open to working with the joint venture.
An Energy Department database that maps the location of chargers highlights the gaping holes in current networks. In Minnesota, for example, fast chargers are sprinkled across the bustling Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But in the state’s northern city Duluth, home to nearly 90,000 people, there are just five fast-charging ports, four of which can charge only Tesla cars.
Fast chargers are concentrated in wealthier counties, according to a study by Bumper, an online marketplace for cars. There are also racial disparities. Counties where most residents are Black have, on average, fewer than half as many chargers per capita as white counties, according to Bumper. Native American counties have even fewer.

Huge in Mexico. Struggling With Mom.: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Fleeing the strictures of modern life in a hypercompetitive South Korea, a young woman found a calmer way of life in Mexico -- and millions of social media followers.
To her mother in South Korea, SuJin Kim is a failure: She's over 30, single and not working for a big Korean corporation.
But to her millions of followers in Latin America, she has become a relatable friend and a teacher of all things Korean. In Mexico, where she lives, they know her, in fact, as "Chinguamiga," her online nickname, a mash-up of the words for friend in Korean and Spanish.
Her success has been propelled not just by her ingenuity and charisma, but also by a wave of South Korean popular culture that has swept the world, driven in part by a government effort to position the country as a cultural giant and to exert a soft power.
In her homeland, Ms. Kim, 32, struggled with the grind of a hypercompetitive society where success is defined narrowly and young women face diminishing labor prospects, grueling work schedules, sexism and restrictive beauty standards.
In Mexico, the growing interest in all things Korean has made her a social-media sensation with more than 24 million followers on TikTok and over eight million subscribers to her YouTube channel, allowing her to gain popularity, financial stability and a romantic partner -- all on her own terms.
"There was a packaging that she came with," said Dr. Renato Balderrama, who leads the Center for Asian Studies at the Autonomous University of Nuevo León in Monterrey, an industrial hub with an expanding Korean presence. "She had all this training in Korea, in this new Korea that allows her to land in a place like Mexico and be successful."
A sort of a teacher of comparative pop culture, Ms. Kim offers lessons on popular Korean soap operas, lyrics, fashion standards, traditions and social norms. She once worked as a waitress in Mexico for a day and posted about her confusion with tips. (South Korea is a no-tip country.) She showed followers how Korean students crammed for exams. She started traveling across Mexico tasting regional delicacies.
Her social media success has attracted invitations to events, award nominations, magazine spreads and sponsorship deals, and yielded a popular business teaching Korean language classes online. She moved from Monterrey to Mexico City to gain more exposure and grow her brand.
Ms. Kim's budding empire now includes an online store of Korean beauty products. She will be featured as a contestant in the second season of HBO's "Bake Off Celebrity" show.
Ms. Kim's success tracks the growth of Korean influence in Mexico and the region.More than 2,000 Korean companies have a presence in Mexico, part of a so-called near-shoring strategy that has driven larger corporations -- Kia, LG, Samsung, Hyundai, among others -- to take advantage of a free-trade agreement with Canada and the United States.
South Korea has not only arrived in Mexico with jobs, cars and cellphones, but also with something more intangible: its own idea of modern culture. K-pop, K-beauty and K-dramas have shown Latin Americans a new, different way to be cool.
K-pop bands have been performing to increasingly bigger and sold-out venues since 2012. This year, a summer festival will bring 16 Korean groups to Mexico City, with ticket prices starting at around $ 170.
Some newsstands specialize in magazines, posters and merchandise about South Korean celebrities. Netflix offers dubbing in "Latin Spanish" for Korean shows. Movie theaters stream live K-pop concerts performed abroad.
Ms. Kim grew up in Seoul but after a work-study stint in Canada and traveling through South America, she returned home and found life in South Korea stifling.
"I don't want to go back to my old life," she remembered thinking.
She moved to Mexico in 2018, driven by a desire to experience life in Latin America and trying to escape severe burnout. She worked for a Korean multinational corporation and found the work rhythm all too familiar so she started teaching Korean.
Then the pandemic upended the world.
"It's my moment, I have nothing to do," she recalled thinking before she started to post her Korean classes on YouTube. "I had zero views, nobody saw me."
Her videos were straightforward language lessons "Easy Words in Korean -- 3 Minutes!" But then she pivoted to TikTok and uploaded a short clip, this time explaining Korean culture.
"That same day it had like 5,000 views and I was like, what?!" she said, her pointy nails adorned with jeweled stars, bows and moons.
Very quickly, her TikTok following exploded.
One afternoon this year, Ms. Kim welcomed her students to a virtual Korean class on Zoom; she charges $ 35 to $ 45 for each four-week session, with one 90-minute class per week.
When the class started, 76 students had logged on. There were young girls and bespectacled moms and at least one longhaired businessman, spread across Central and South America.
Ms. Kim's bright blue curls bounced on the screen as she moved her head approvingly.
When a student trying to figure out how to pluralize singular nouns asked, "No plural?" she chirped: "No! How neat, right?"
After finishing college in South Korea, Ms. Kim said she experienced severe stress. "I wanted to die and I wished to rest," she said in one of her most popular videos. She has spoken openly about being hospitalized to take care of her mental health.
She attributes her exhaustion to Korea's culture of sacrifice and grind that helped the country become an economic powerhouse after the Korean War.
"Everything is quick, quick, now, right this second," Dr. Balderrama said. "This created a culture where there's no place for mediocrity, there's no place for those unwilling to compete."
In Mexico, Ms. Kim hoped to find a more joyous life: "I saw how Latin culture is, how Latin people live and they're living happily," she said. "I don't want to waste a single moment I'm in Latin America because it's so precious to me."
But if Ms. Kim has found a passion and a business, she has not completely found the peace of mind she was seeking. She's in therapy to deal with what she described as some depression and anxiety.
Her large following and popularity has bred fear: "I feel people will forget me, that nobody will like me," she said, worried about the toll of having to come up with creative content to remain relevant.
"I also have this problem with haters, with people's comments, which affect me," she added.
She does get criticized online by users who say she should go back to Korea, who ask whether she pays taxes in Mexico (she says she does) and who consider her another foreigner lured by life on the cheap and who contribute to the gentrification of parts of the country at the expense of Mexican residents.
In a recent video,as she prepared to go home for a visit she showed an ID card that she said was proof of her status as a legal resident. She wanted to dispel any rumors she had to leave the country because she was on a tourist visa.
Ms. Kim declined to discuss her citizenship status with The New York Times, but months ago she posted a video in which she said she'd taken the exam to become a citizen of Mexico.
By many standards, Ms. Kim has made it. But what about her mother's standards?
"I don't think she'll change her mind about success -- that I'm not a success, that's a fact for her," she said following her visit home. "She's still more worried than happy for me."
Still, after meeting Ms. Kim's boyfriend and his family in South Korea, her parents promised to visit her in Mexico.

Survey of U.S. Cities Shows Nearly 10% Drop in Homicides: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After a surge during the height of Covid, killings have fallen but remain well above prepandemic levels.
In 2020, amid the disruptions of the pandemic and the social upheaval following the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, the United States saw the largest increase in its homicide rate in modern history. Now, more than three years after the start of the pandemic, the country is on track to record one of its largest -- if not the largest -- annual declines in homicides, according to a report released on Thursday.
Even so, violent crime is still considerably higher than just before the pandemic, the benchmark that police chiefs and city leaders are striving to return to, as cities remain awash in guns.
In the new report, the nonpartisan Council on Criminal Justice examined crime data from 30 U.S. cities -- including Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia and Denver -- and found that through the first half of the year there were 202 fewer homicides, a drop of more than 9 percent. Still, homicides across those cities are 24 percent higher than in same period of 2019.
"I would call the result heartening," said Richard Rosenfeld, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Missouri-St. Louis who was the lead author of the report. "Not a cause for celebration. Most cities have not returned to the homicide levels that were prevailing just prior to the height of the pandemic. So we have a ways to go."
The latest data at least offers a hopeful sign that the increases in violent crime during the pandemic were not the start of a new era of steadily rising crime, as many experts have worried. But the data is limited to the cities in which the council could obtain data, and the authors cautioned that for some categories only a few cities released statistics.
Gun assaults, for instance, declined 5.6 percent -- a positive sign for gun violence overall -- but that was based on only the 10 cities in the study that provided gun assault data. Robberies, burglaries and larcenies were also down. Car thefts, which have risen substantially in recent years, partially because of the ease in which teenagers have been able to steal Kia and Hyundai models, rose even further.
The council began tracking crime at the start of the pandemic, seeking to provide a timely snapshot of national trends and fill the void in comprehensive data from government agencies. The F.B.I., which typically releases national statistics in the fall for the prior year, has been hampered by a shift in 2021 to a new reporting system that saw several large cities, such as Chicago and New York, fail to submit data.
Just as criminologists struggle to reach a consensus to explain sudden increases in crime like the United States saw in 2020, concrete explanations for declines in crime are similarly elusive.
"It's like explaining the score at halftime," said Jeff Asher, a crime analyst based in New Orleans who tracks homicides across American cities and levels of law enforcement staffing. "Even if you are up by two touchdowns, it's still halftime. And so understanding that context makes it hard to say, 'Oh it's because it's x, y or z.' We don't have a strong understanding yet. And it'll be a little while until we do have an understanding."
But many agree that the disruptions of the pandemic -- the social isolation, the closure of schools and jobs lost -- likely led to an increase in crime. More contentious is an unproven theory cited by some experts that amid the social unrest that followed the murder of Mr. Floyd, officers in some places pulled back from enforcement and some citizens, distrustful of law enforcement, stopped working with police.
Notably, violent crime has fallen at a time when many police departments are smaller than they were before the pandemic. While the defund the police movement, which grew out of the Floyd protests, lost momentum as crime rose, police staffing levels declined in many cities as officers retired or quit and as many departments struggled to recruit new officers in a competitive U.S. job market. The result for some major cities has been an unintended experiment in what a smaller police department looks like.
Los Angeles, for example, is down about 1,000 officers since 2019 -- it had about 9,200 officers at the end of last year -- and hundreds of civilian workers. And yet homicides are down more than 20 percent this year, and overall gun violence has fallen at a similar clip.
"We are still not done with getting back to crime levels, community safety levels, that we saw just four years ago," Chief Michel Moore of the Los Angeles Police Department said in an interview. He added: "We're not home free because of the persistence of gun violence, and the persistence of too many guns in too many hands."
With fewer officers, Mr. Moore said the department was relying on overtime and on focusing resources on the most serious violent and property crimes. He said that the department was not responding as quickly as it used to for lesser issues, like neighborhood disputes or loud, late-night parties. The department's goal is to hire 700 more officers and 300 more civilians this year.
"The service levels have been impacted," he said, adding that the change has come at the expense of community members who typically interact with the police only on that type of lower level issue. That "gives me concern because it undermines their sense of confidence and their sense of safety in the department, and in government," he said.
A similar dynamic of smaller departments and falling crime has also played out in Philadelphia, which had about 5,800 officers at the end of last year, more than 700 fewer than in 2019. The city saw homicides decline more than 20 percent and has spent millions of dollars in overtime.
In Minneapolis, whose homicide data is not included in the council's report, violent crime is also down substantially, and the department has about 300 fewer officers than in 2019. To maintain the reductions in crime, the department has said it would focus its limited resources this summer on crime hot spots in the city.
Even with the increases in recent years, violent crime is still far below its historical peaks reached in the early 1990s. In periods of the last century when murders and violent crime surged, policymakers responded with ever harsher criminal justice policies: mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes, tough new laws for juvenile offenders and massive increases in policing, all of which led to mass incarceration.
And as crime rose in recent years, some mayors and governors did respond with tough-on-crime rhetoric. But, at least so far, there have not been major policy shifts toward more punitive measures like during the 1980s and 1990s, said Jeffrey A. Fagan, an expert on crime and policing at Columbia Law School. Efforts to overhaul bail systems are continuing and progressive prosecutors are being elected in many cities, which, he said, "showed that you really didn't need these harsh measures that were put in place to have violence rates and murder rates decline."

New York City Shootings Are Down Compared With 2022's Tally: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Murders and rapes were also down, part of a nationwide trend after a post-pandemic spike.
Shootings in New York City dropped by about 25 percent through the first half of this year compared with the same period last year, extending a downward trend after a spike in violent crime during the pandemic.
The sharp drop, which mirrored similar decreases across the United States, came amid widespread fears about crime in the city, which officials have blamed for keeping workers and suburbanites cloistered in their homes.
At a briefing on Thursday, Edward Caban, the acting police commissioner, said that shootings had declined for 13 consecutive weeks. The numbers were released at the beginning of summer, when violence historically rises, but he said he was "confident" that the department's positive streak would continue in the summer.
"It is no coincidence," Mr. Caban said. "From the beginning of this administration, we made the fight against gun violence our top priority."
Through Sunday, reports of five of the seven offenses that the Police Department ranks as major felonies had gone down, while two increased, police data show. Murders, rapes and burglaries decreased by about 10 percent each; robberies fell nearly 5 percent. But car thefts increased 18 percent and felony assaults by 6 percent.
Michael Lipetri, chief of crime control strategies, tied the increase in car thefts to the ease of stealing certain models of cars. "You could basically steal a Hyundai or a Kia in seconds," he said on Thursday.
Transit crimes, which have overall fallen by nearly 4 percent this year, increased by about 19 percent over the past month compared to the same period last year, according to Police Department data. Officials did not shed light on the spike at the news conference.
Crime data is a "roller coaster," said Jeffrey A. Fagan, a professor at Columbia Law School. Causality, he said, is "almost impossible to prove," though police departments often take credit.
"Crime goes up, crime goes down, people are alarmed and the police department changes its tactics," he said. "Whatever changes they've made, they don't seem able to interrupt this cycle."
"What they're observing in New York is happening all over the country," Mr. Fagan said.
At the beginning of last year, as the pandemic eased and people began returning to their routines, the city struggled to stem an increase in violence.
Mayor Eric Adams, whose tenure began in 2022, made reversing the trend, specifically reining in gun violence, a central goal. Mr. Adams appointed a "gun violence czar." He also expanded a jobs program and Saturday Night Lights, which offers activities for children between the ages of 11 and 18.
But the crime-fighting approaches of Mr. Adams and the Police Department have also been met with criticism.
Last year, the department announced an initiative designed to enforce what they called quality-of-life crimes, focusing on things like public drinking, urination and disorderly groups. Critics said that the enforcement is a return to "broken windows" policing, the enforcement of low-level offenses in an effort to prevent more serious crimes, which they said results in harassment.
In June, a court-appointed monitor found that anti-crime units, then under the leadership of the former commissioner, Keechant Sewell, were still stopping, frisking and searching too many people, despite assurances from Mr. Adams that new policies and training would prevent the problem. A report from The City this week found that there had been a 600 percent increase in police vehicle pursuits in the year's first three months.
For David Caba, vice president at Bronx Rises Against Gun Violence, the drop in gun violence that the department emphasized on Thursday reflects the work of social service organizations such as his.
Since the pandemic disruptions have ebbed, his teams, which operate in six zones within the Bronx, have seen shootings and homicides fall, he said. The zones are each made up of about 12 to 15 blocks that have grappled with high rates of violence. One zone has gone over a year without a single shooting or murder, he said.
"It takes everyone," he said, adding: "It ain't just one entity that's going to come in and provide a remedy."

Ford's U.S. Sales Rose 10% in Second Quarter
Ford Motor said Thursday that its new-vehicle sales rose 10 percent in the three months of April through June, thanks to robust demand for trucks. The automaker sold 531,662 motor vehicles, up from 483,688 in the second quarter last year, as sales of pickups, delivery vans and heavy trucks increased 26 percent. The gain in truck sales more than offset a decline of nearly 3 percent in sales of electric vehicles. Ford sold 14,843 battery-powered cars and trucks in the quarter, down from 15,273 a year earlier. It has had to slow production to upgrade assembly lines. The upgrade work mainly affected the Mustang Mach-E, whose sales declined 21 percent in the second quarter. Ford also sold 4,466 F-150 Lightning electric pickup trucks in the quarter. That was more than double the total from a year earlier and the second-highest quarterly total since the truck went on sale. On Wednesday, General Motors, Honda, Nissan, Hyundai and Kia reported increases of 14 percent or more. Overall, automakers sold more than 4.1 million cars and trucks in the second quarter, according to Cox Automotive, a market research firm, an increase of 16 percent from a year earlier. The total, however, was about 400,000 fewer cars than the industry typically sold in the second quarter before the coronavirus pandemic. Sales remain below their prepandemic levels because parts shortages have forced automakers to produce fewer vehicles for much of the last three years. The supply of computer chips, which have been particularly hard to get, has improved in recent months. NEAL E. BOUDETTE

Amazon's iRobot Deal Is in E.U.'s Cross Hairs
Amazon's $ 1.7 billion acquisition of iRobot may reduce competition and strengthen Amazon's position as an online marketplace provider, European Union antitrust regulators warned on Thursday. The European Commission opened a full-scale investigation and will decide by Nov. 15 whether to clear or block the deal for iRobot, the robot vacuum cleaner maker. "We continue to work through the process with the European Commission and are focused on addressing its questions and any identified concerns at this stage," an Amazon spokesperson said. Antitrust enforcers around the world have increased scrutiny of Big Tech acquiring smaller rivals, concerned about the accumulation of data by a few companies, and big players leveraging their dominance into new markets. The acquisition announced last August that it would add iRobot's Roomba robot vacuum to Amazon's portfolio of smart devices, which include the Alexa voice assistant, smart thermostats, security devices and wall-mounted smart displays. IRobot made its first Roomba robot vacuum in 2002. Amazon has previously said the vacuum cleaner market is very competitive, with lots of Chinese players. "The commission is concerned that the transaction would allow Amazon to restrict competition in the market for robot vacuum cleaners and to strengthen its position as online marketplace provider," an E.U. executive said. The Amazon spokesperson also said the company could "offer a company like iRobot the resources to accelerate innovation and invest in critical features while lowering prices for consumers." REUTERS

New-Car Sales Take Off As Chip Shortage Eases: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: General Motors, Toyota and other automakers sold more trucks and sport utility vehicles as supply chain problems eased and demand remained strong despite rising interest rates.
Some of the country's biggest automakers reported big sales increases for the second quarter on Wednesday, the strongest sign yet that the auto industry was bouncing back from parts shortages and overcoming the effects of higher interest rates.
General Motors, the largest U.S. automaker, said it sold 691,978 vehicles from April to June, up 19 percent from a year earlier. It was the company's highest quarterly total in more than two years.
Automakers have struggled in the last two years with a shortage of computer chips that forced factory shutdowns and left dealers with few vehicles to sell. More recently, rising interest rates have made auto loans more expensive, causing some consumers to defer purchases or opt for used vehicles.
"I'm not saying we are on the cusp of exciting growth here," said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, a research firm. "But we are now at a turning point where the auto market returns to more balance. It's the beginning of returning to normal."
The easing of chip shortages has allowed automakers to restock dealer lots, making it easier for car buyers to find the models and features they want, Mr. Smoke said. At the end of June, dealers had about 1.8 million vehicles in stock, nearly 800,000 more than at the same point in 2022, according to Cox data.
Sales have also been helped by strong job creation and rising wages, Mr. Smoke said.
At the same time, however, higher interest rates and higher car prices have put new-car purchases out of reach of many consumers. In the first half of the year, the average price paid for a new vehicle was a near-record $ 48,564. The average interest rate paid on car loans in the first six months of 2023 was 7.09 percent, up from 4.86 percent a year earlier, according to Cox. The average monthly payment in the first half was $ 784, up from $ 691.
"Demand will be limited by the level of prices and rates, which are not likely to come down enough to stimulate more demand than the market can bear," Mr. Smoke said.
Cox estimated that total sales of new cars and trucks rose 11.6 percent in the first half of the year, to 7.65 million. The firm now expects full-year sales to top 15 million, which would be a rise of 8 percent.
Several automakers reported solid quarterly sales on Wednesday. Toyota said its U.S. sales rose 7 percent, to 568,962 cars and light trucks. Stellantis, the company that owns Jeep, Ram, Chrysler and other brands, reported a 6 percent rise, to 434,648 vehicles.
Honda, which had been severely hampered by chip shortages, said its sales rose 45 percent to 347,025 cars and trucks. Hyundai and Kia, the South Korean automakers, each sold more than 210,000 vehicles, posting gains of 14 percent and 15 percent.
Electric vehicles remain the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry. Rivian, a maker of electric pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, said on Monday that it delivered 12,640 in the second quarter, a 59 percent jump from a year earlier. And on Sunday, Tesla reported an 83 percent jump in global sales in the second quarter.
Cox estimated that more than 500,000 electric vehicles were sold in the United States in the first six months of the year, and that more than one million would be sold in 2023, setting a record for battery-powered cars and trucks in the country.
Tesla, which does not break out its sales by country, remains the largest seller of E.V.s in the U.S. market. Cox estimated that the company sold more than 161,000 electric cars in the second quarter in the United States. Ford Motor, which offers three fully electric models., reports its quarterly sales on Thursday.
G.M. sold more 15,300 battery-powered cars and trucks, but nearly 14,000 were the Chevrolet Bolt, a smaller vehicle that the company will stop making at the end of the year. The company also sold 1,348 Cadillac Lyriq electric S.U.V.s and 47 GMC Hummer pickup trucks. Chevrolet will soon start delivering a new electric Silverado pickup truck, which uses the same battery technology as the Lyriq and Hummer.

Higher Tech Raises Cost To Fix Cars: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: More technology and creature comforts, as well as a parade of new electric vehicles, have complicated the job after accidents.
New cars and trucks are packed with sensors and technology that protect and pamper drivers and passengers. But those features are also raising the cost of repairs after accidents.
The average cost of making damaged cars good as new has soared 36 percent since 2018, and may top $ 5,000 by the end of this year, according to Mitchell, a company that provides data and software to insurance companies and auto repair businesses. That big increase is the main reason that insurance premiums have been soaring -- up 17 percent in the 12 months through May.
New sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, including a rapidly growing number of electric models, have become so complex and luxurious that seemingly simple repairs can cost a small fortune, auto experts said. Insurers are often on the hook for much of those costs, leading them to raise their rates.
Materials designed to crumple or deform in a crash to protect pedestrians or passengers, for example, can be hard or impossible to repair. Many bumpers must be replaced after low-speed dings because the safety sensors embedded in them may no longer work properly after repairs. Other systems, even some that do not appear to be damaged, must be inspected or recalibrated.
"The modern digital architecture is so advanced that systems beyond point of impact are being disrupted," said Ryan Mandell, director of claims performance for Mitchell. "Getting a car back to pre-loss condition is harder than at any point in history, and will only become more challenging."
Industry experts have been particularly focused on the cost of repairing electric cars and trucks, which aren't built like gasoline cars and have different parts. In addition, many mechanics aren't trained to work on them. In recent months, news reports and stories shared on social media about astronomical repair bills for electric cars and trucks have captured the attention of car enthusiasts.
Consider the case of Chris Apfelstadt and his Rivian R1T pickup truck, which was rear-ended by a Lexus in February at a stoplight in Columbus, Ohio, while he was driving and his infant son was in the back seat.
The damage was initially deemed relatively minor, and the other driver's insurer offered him $ 1,600. The actual cost to fix the bumper at a business certified to repair Rivian vehicles -- one of just three in Ohio -- was $ 42,000, roughly half the truck's selling price.
"I expected it to be expensive," said Mr. Apfelstadt, who owns a lighting company, "but it was still a shocking number."
A key reason is that the accident damaged a sleek panel that extends from the truck's rear to front roof pillars. Repairing and repainting it set off a cascade of pricey work, including removing the interior ceiling material, known as the headliner, and front windshield.
Some of the cost probably also had to do with Rivian's small size and youth. Like other auto start-ups, the company, which is based in Irvine, Calif., and delivered its first vehicles to customers in 2021, does not sell through franchised dealers and has had to build an independent repair network from scratch.
Ford Motor has 2,800 North American dealers equipped to repair its electric vehicles, along with a vast network of independent shops and aftermarket suppliers. Rivian has certified about 200 North American collision shops.
"It's a challenge that we're newer to market," said Noe Mejia, Rivian's vice president of service operations. But, he added, Rivian's smaller scale and lack of bureaucracy allow it to work directly with customers and shops to ensure repairs meet high standards.
Mr. Apfelstadt's story was discussed extensively on the internet. To some people, accounts such as his, and harrowing tales of cars totaled after minor accidents shared online by some owners of Tesla cars, have become cautionary tales about the financial perils of owning electric cars.
Auto experts acknowledge that repairing electric models is more expensive on average than repairing gasoline vehicles. But a fuller analysis of claims and repair data shows that electric vehicle repair costs are not markedly higher than costs for gasoline cars of similar age and price, and that they're sometimes less.
"The idea that E.V.s are being totaled left and right is the horror story that keeps insurers up at night," Mr. Mandell said. "Has that happened? Yes. But the incidents are few and far between."
Data from Mitchell shows that in 2022 electric vehicles cost about $ 6,800 on average to fix after accidents, about $ 2,400 more than the average for all cars. Battery-powered cars tend to require more expensive parts, the company said, and repairing them takes more time and may require work by specialist mechanics.
But a big reason electric cars tend to cost much more to repair, at first glance, is that most of them are newer luxury models. Tesla's cars, which sell for between $ 40,000 and around $ 110,000, account for 75 percent of collision claims for battery-powered models.
Fixing electric vehicles from mainstream brands such as Hyundai or Nissan costs only about $ 800 more than their gasoline counterparts, according to Mitchell. And in the premium segment, typical repair costs for battery-powered and gasoline vehicles are roughly the same, around $ 7,000, for model years 2018 and later.
Other data suggests that electric vehicles fare relatively well. About 18 percent of gasoline cars involved in crashes are totaled, while only about 6 percent of battery-powered vehicles are deemed unrepairable after accidents, according to Mitchell.
Matt Moore, a senior vice president at the Highway Loss Data Institute, a research organization that serves the insurance industry, said insurance and repair data undercut the idea that batteries or electric technology racked up burdensome repair costs. For 11 models that are available in gasoline and electric versions -- including the Hyundai Kona and Volvo XC40 -- repair costs for the electric models are just 2 percent higher, according to the institute's analysis.
Gasoline or electric, Mr. Moore said, more expensive, rare and higher-performing cars tend to be involved in fewer but more severe accidents in part because they are more likely to be driven by people who speed and take other risks.
"They hit fast and hit hard," he said. "Every collision is a mix of man and machine."
But auto experts added that damage to the battery pack of electric cars -- their most expensive part -- could make them harder to repair, requiring special tools and advanced training.
"Right now, if there's serious damage to the pack, nobody is anxious to take a shot at repairing that," said Sandy Munro, an engineer and consultant who hosts a popular YouTube show on which he has interviewed Elon Musk, the Tesla chief executive, and others in the auto industry.
Automakers say they are aware of rising repair costs and are working to make cars easier to fix, especially electric vehicles, which many executives expect to replace most or all gasoline models in the coming decades.
BMW has equipped its electric vehicles with sensors that provide data on crash-force direction and intensity. That information can guide technicians on which battery modules need replacement. Ford has made it so its dealers can replace a damaged battery tray on the Mustang Mach-E and swap all components into a new tray. General Motors is developing a process to let dealers repair and replace packs, including individual battery modules that are damaged.
Even though repair costs are climbing, Mr. Munro emphasized that newer cars provided significant benefits over older vehicles. They can absorb horrifying crash forces and let occupants walk away. Or they avoid collisions entirely, using the same cameras and sensors that make for trickier repairs.
"If nobody dies but we can't fix that bumper, I don't care about that," he said. "It's only scrap iron. The focus is rightly on the people inside and the efficiency of the car."

Electrify America to Add Tesla Plugs at Its Stations
The second-largest electric vehicle fast-charging network in the U.S. says it will add Tesla's connector to its charging stations, another step toward adopting Tesla's plug as the industry standard. Electrify America, with 800 direct-current fast-charging stations and more than 3,600 plugs nationwide, said Thursday it would work to add Tesla's connector to existing and future chargers by 2025. The company also will keep the Combined Charging System, or CCS, connector at its stations. At present most electric vehicle models in the U.S. use the CCS connector. But Ford, General Motors, Rivian and Volvo have said they would join Tesla's large Supercharger network and adopt its North American Charging Standard connector in new versions of their electric vehicles. Others such as Stellantis and Hyundai are considering joining Tesla's network. ASSOCIATED PRESS
SPACEFLIGHT
Italian Researchers Soar to the Edge of Space
A team of Italian researchers reached the edge of space Thursday, flying aboard a rocket-powered plane piloted by Virgin Galactic as the space tourism company prepares for monthly commercial flights. The flight launched from Spaceport America in the New Mexico desert, with two Italian Air Force officers and an engineer with the National Research Council of Italy focusing on a series of microgravity experiments during their few minutes of weightlessness. One wore a special suit that measured biometric data and physiological responses while another conducted tests using sensors to track heart rate, brain function and other metrics while in microgravity. The third studied how certain liquids and solids mix in that very weak gravity. Virgin Galactic livestreamed the flight, showing the moment when the ship released from its carrier plane and the rocket was ignited. The entire trip took about 90 minutes. The space plane reached a peak altitude of more than 52 miles. ASSOCIATED PRESS
ECONOMY
Fall in Jobless Claims is Sign of Resilience
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week by the most in 20 months, the latest sign of the economy's resilience that could push the Federal Reserve to resume raising interest rates in July. The unexpected decline in applications reported by the Labor Department on Thursday reversed a recent jump, which had left initial jobless claims over the prior three weeks hovering at levels last seen in October 2021. The elevated readings had led some economists to conclude that layoffs were picking up as the economy begins to feel the heat from the Fed's hefty rate increases. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 26,000 to a seasonally adjusted 239,000 last week. The drop was the largest since October 2021. Unadjusted claims dropped 17,843 to 233,048 last week. Claims tumbled 10,108 in California and plunged 9,187 in Texas. They dropped 3,263 in Pennsylvania, while Minnesota reported a 2,387 decline.

Western Allies Pledge Billions Toward the Reconstruction of Ukraine: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The price tag for reconstruction has soared, driving debate among U.S. and European officials, legal experts and others about using frozen Russian assets to pay for it.
Western countries pledged tens of billions of dollars to rebuild war-torn Ukraine on Wednesday, as leaders gathered at a two-day conference convened by the British government in the shadow of Ukraine's counteroffensive against Russia.
But with the total cost of reconstruction projected to spiral into the hundreds of billions of dollars, the prospect of using confiscated Russian assets to pay for it emerged as a potent, if problematic, theme at the gathering.
Britain and the European Union are both exploring legal mechanisms to divert frozen Russian assets to Ukraine. Globally, these public and private assets are estimated to be worth at least $ 300 billion, a sizable chunk of the total reconstruction cost, which the World Bank currently estimates at more than $ 411 billion.
While few legal experts question the right of countries to freeze foreign assets, some warn that confiscating a large amount of Russian funds could set a troublesome legal precedent and undermine confidence in financial markets.
The pledges, rolled out by Britain, the United States, and the European Union, sought to shift public attention, at least for the moment, from the battlefield to the yearslong reconstruction of Ukraine that will follow the war.
"It's clear Russia must pay for the destruction it inflicted," Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain said in opening the conference.
"As we've seen in Bakhmut and Mariupol, what Russia cannot take it will seek to destroy," Mr. Sunak added. "They want to do the same to Ukraine's economy."
Speaking to the participants by video link, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine argued that there was economic opportunity in the ruins of his country. He thanked the donors but pleaded with them to start investing immediately.
"We must move from vision to agreements, and from agreements to real projects," Mr. Zelensky said.
Britain announced assistance that includes 240 million pounds ( $ 305 million) of direct economic assistance and $ 3 billion in World Bank loan guarantees. The loans are intended to encourage an influx of private investment to rebuild Ukrainian cities and towns destroyed by Russian forces.
The European Union laid out an ambitious package that would include 50 billion euros (about $ 55 billion) from 2024 to 2027. About €17 billion would come in grants, and the rest in the form of low-interest loans. The package must be approved by all 27 members of the bloc, however, and it may face hurdles.
"This plan could become an anchor for all international donors," said Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission. "This is what I mean when I say we are with Ukraine for as long as it takes."
The United States announced $ 1.3 billion in additional economic aid, roughly split between funds to overhaul Ukraine's heavily damaged energy infrastructure and to modernize ports, railways and border crossings.
"As Russia continues to destroy, we are here to help Ukraine rebuild," said Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, noting that the package had bipartisan support in Congress. "Recovery is about laying the foundation for Ukraine to thrive."
The United States has delivered more than $ 20 billion in economic assistance to Ukraine, Mr. Blinken said, as well as $ 2.1 billion in humanitarian aid. It is also the largest provider of military aid to the Ukrainian military.
Britain, which is also one of Ukraine's largest military suppliers, is leveraging London's status as a global center of finance and insurance to stimulate foreign investment, in part by trying to reduce the risks to investors.
The $ 3 billion in loan guarantees to the World Bank extends over three years, Mr. Sunak said, and is backed by more than 400 companies from 38 countries, including Virgin, Sanofi, Phillips and Hyundai Engineering.
The World Bank's estimate of the reconstruction costs doesn't cover the far-flung damage caused by the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine this month. The price tag is so enormous -- and is rising so rapidly -- that it has renewed calls to confiscate Russian assets to pay for it.
"The Russian assets issue is the elephant in the room at the conference," said Philip D. Zelikow, a historian at the University of Virginia and Stanford University who has written about Ukraine's long-term recovery. "If we don't use Russian assets, we simply won't have nearly enough money to do it."
Mr. Zelikow said reconstruction without Russian assets would require massive state outlays, which will be politically untenable in several countries, not least the United States. But for now, he said, the intense focus on private investment is postponing harder questions about the role of Russian money.
Ukraine's government is already using confiscated Russian assets in its country to pay for rebuilding, according to its prime minister, Denys Shmyhal. Appearing at the conference Wednesday, he encouraged Western countries to develop legal mechanisms to allow them to confiscate assets frozen in their countries for similar purposes.
"Russia must pay for what it has destroyed," Mr. Shmyhal said.
But the issue remains sensitive. The European Central Bank has privately warned Brussels that confiscating Russian funds or giving the interest earned on those accounts to Ukraine could undermine confidence in the euro and shake financial stability.
If the United States were to do it, some say it would unnerve countries that hold large foreign exchange reserves in dollars. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen warned last February of "significant legal obstacles" to it.
Britain announced legislation this week that would allow it to leave sanctions in place until Russia pays reparations to its neighbor. Britain has frozen roughly $ 23 billion in assets and imposed sanctions on 1,550 individuals.
"It is absolutely right that we explore all legal paths, both domestically and internationally, to send a message," said James Cleverly, the British foreign secretary. "I'm confident we will unlock the funds necessary to Ukraine's recovery."
But Mr. Cleverly, like other Western officials, sidestepped questions about how, and when, that might be accomplished.
Mr. Zelikow argued there was ample precedent. In a recent essay in Foreign Affairs that he co-wrote with Lawrence H. Summers and Robert B. Zoellick, Mr. Zelikow noted that after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, France, Britain, and the United States transferred frozen Iraqi state funds into an international escrow account to pay compensation.
Although fighting is still raging in Ukraine, analysts said it was important to start planning the postwar rebuilding process, to avoid the kind of delays that dogged the reconstruction of Europe after World War II.
"Without any kind of planning, these delays can mount, and they can lead to human misery and to failure of economies and to basically foreign policy failures," Howard Shatz, a senior economist at RAND Corporation, told reporters last week. "So, it is important to start planning now."

How Detectives Broke a Logjam In Four Student Deaths in Idaho: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In the weeks after four University of Idaho students were found slaughtered in a house near campus last November, a growing roster of investigators desperately searching for answers had yet to identify a suspect or even find the murder weapon.
Publicly, the authorities were assuring worried residents in the small college town that they were making progress. Privately, they were exhausting their prospects, scouring through the backgrounds of those with the thinnest possible connections to the case.
Through the first two weeks of December, investigators put some of their focus on classmates of the victims; they also widened the search to examine a man in another state who had been known to send harassing messages to women but had visited Idaho only twice in his life. They looked at a woman previously charged with assaults in the region. They looked at a man once accused of wielding a knife. They looked at sex offenders. They looked at a white supremacist. Each turned out to be a dead end.
Then, after spending weeks sifting through an array of evidence that seemed to lead nowhere, investigators announced an arrest in late December on the other side of the country: Bryan Kohberger, a Ph.D. student from a nearby university. He was identified only after investigators turned to an advanced method of DNA analysis that had rarely been used in active murder investigations.
The story of how dozens of officers from local, state and federal agencies took the quadruple murder investigation into extraordinary territory is only now becoming more apparent, through recently obtained records and interviews with people familiar with the investigation who discussed key details that emerged before the issuance of a gag order in the case.
The case has shown the degree to which law enforcement investigators have come to rely on the digital footprints that ordinary Americans leave in nearly every facet of their lives. Online shopping, car sales, carrying a cellphone, drives along city streets and amateur genealogy all played roles in an investigation that was solved, in the end, as much through technology as traditional sleuthing.
Now indicted on four counts of murder, Mr. Kohberger has declined to enter a plea but contended previously through his lawyer that he would be exonerated. Investigators have yet to detail a possible motive: To this day, family members of the victims remain unaware of any prior connections that the accused killer had with the four young people who were killed.
The process of identifying and arresting a suspect took over six weeks -- weeks of increasing frustration and painstaking examination of evidence as the community pushed for answers.
The first 911 call came in around noon, some seven hours after the murders. Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20, had been stabbed to death overnight in their bedrooms. Initially, the Moscow Police Department described the attack as "targeted" and assured residents that there was no risk to the public. But with no indication of who had committed the attack or why, the authorities eventually backtracked.
"We cannot say that there is no threat to the community," the police chief, James Fry, said at a news conference on Nov. 16, three days after the killings.
The department, which had only a few dozen officers, enlisted the Idaho State Police and the F.B.I. to help, bringing in dozens of additional investigators. Forensic teams processed evidence from the bedrooms, snapped photos around the home's back door and hunted for footprints; others searched for surveillance video from around town.
A week after the killings, records show, investigators were on the lookout for a certain type of vehicle: Nissan Sentras from the model years 2019 to 2023. Quietly, they ran down details on thousands of such vehicles, including the owners' addresses, license plate numbers and the color of each sedan.
But further scrutiny of the video footage produced more clarity, and on Nov. 25 the police in Moscow asked law enforcement agencies to look for a different type of car with a similar shape: white Hyundai Elantras from the model years 2011 to 2013.
Just across the state border, at Washington State University, campus police officers began looking through their records for Elantras registered there. Among those they found was one registered to Mr. Kohberger, who had moved to the area earlier in 2022 to pursue a Ph.D. in criminology.
They checked Mr. Kohberger's car more closely, according to a court affidavit, including visiting the parking lot near his apartment in the early morning hours of Nov. 29. But the vehicle was a 2015 model, not the earlier models being sought in Moscow.
The next day, records show, investigators in Moscow were also looking closely at another vehicle: Ms. Goncalves's car. She had purchased a 2015 Range Rover in the days before her death. Detectives gathered information on the registration, history and legal owners, clearly interested in the history of who had owned the car. But once again, the information provided few answers.
With students at the University of Idaho preparing for final exams, there was a permanent sense of apprehension in the air, as people began locking their doors, acquiring pepper spray and asking on social media how such a brazen killer could remain undetected for so long in a town that had not seen a murder in seven years.
The hunt broadened as investigators vacuumed up more records and data. They had already sought cellphone data for all phones that pinged cell towers within a half-mile of the victims' house from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., according to search warrant filings. They collected victims' bank records, email correspondence and social media account data.
On Dec. 5, detectives made a new request for surveillance video, seeking all footage recorded on U.P.S. delivery trucks in the days before and after the killings.
The next day, after getting back data on Ms. Goncalves's account on the Tinder dating app, detectives asked for details on 19 specific account-holders, including their locations, credit card information and any "private images, pictures or videos" associated with the accounts.
The request allowed the inquiry to go much broader than an ordinary search for information, using a single warrant to target 19 different people, said Orin Kerr, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
"You couldn't get one warrant to search 19 houses," he said.
Investigators were also working with a key piece of evidence: a Ka-Bar knife sheath, branded with a U.S. Marine Corps logo, that had been found next to two of the victims. They initially began looking for local stores that may have sold the weapon, and then fanned out.
A request to Amazon sought the order histories of account holders who had purchased such knives. A follow-up request to eBay focused on a series of specific users, seeking their purchase histories. Some had connections to the area -- including one in Idaho and two in Washington State -- while others were from far away, including an account in Japan. Because of redactions, it is unclear if Mr. Kohberger's name came up in those records.
The overall data track was growing enormous, demonstrating the extensive breadth of data on consumer platforms that can be made accessible to law enforcement agencies when they are at the stage of hunting for bread crumbs.
"You could say this is uncharted territory," Mr. Kerr said. "They are novel legal questions when there are so many records out there."
At the same time, DNA from the scene was being processed. Forensic teams had examined the knife sheath and found DNA that did not belong to any of the inhabitants of the house. They ran the sample through the F.B.I.'s database, which contains millions of DNA profiles of past criminal offenders, but according to three people briefed on the case, they did not get a match.
At that point, investigators decided to try genetic genealogy, a method that until now has been used primarily to solve cold cases, not active murder investigations. Among the growing number of genealogy websites that help people trace their ancestors and relatives via their own DNA, some allow users to select an option that permits law enforcement to compare crime scene DNA samples against the websites' data.
A distant cousin who has opted into the system can help investigators building a family tree from crime scene DNA to triangulate and identify a potential perpetrator of a crime. In one of the best-known uses of genealogy in solving a cold case, detectives in 2018 were able to arrest a suspect in a string of rapes and murders years before in California that had been attributed to the so-called Golden State Killer.
Once a suspect is identified, a direct genetic comparison can be used as confirmation before making an arrest.
With few formal regulations, the use of mass genealogy databases has raised concerns about privacy and whether limits should be placed on how the method is used. But authorities across the country say they have found potential in the system to produce leads that are unattainable through traditional investigative efforts.
Barbara Rae-Venter, a genealogy consultant who worked on the Golden State Killer case, said there was now growing interest in using genealogical DNA not just in cold cases but also in active crime investigations.
"That is why the Idaho case is so interesting," she said.
To do the genealogical analysis, the Idaho State Police contracted with a private company, Othram, in Texas, which had a lab able to produce a more extensive DNA profile from the knife sheath than the state lab was set up to examine.
F.B.I. personnel worked with the profile that Othram had produced, according to two people familiar with the investigation, spending days building out a family tree that began with a distant relative.
By the morning of Dec. 19, records show, investigators had a name: Bryan Kohberger. He had a white Elantra. He was a student at a university eight miles from the murder scene.
Mr. Kohberger was already out of town, his semester complete. He had driven home with his father to Pennsylvania, stopped twice by the police along the way for what officers said was tailgating. Just as agents began to scour his background more thoroughly, he had been terminated from his position as a teaching assistant, after what was described as altercations with a professor.
On Dec. 23, investigators sought and received Mr. Kohberger's cellphone records. The results added more to their suspicions: His phone was moving around in the early morning hours of Nov. 13, but was disconnected from cell networks -- perhaps turned off -- in the two hours around when the killings occurred.
Four days later, agents in Pennsylvania managed to retrieve some trash from Mr. Kohberger's family residence, sending the material to the Idaho State Police forensic lab. Checking it against their original DNA profile, the lab was able to reach a game-changing conclusion: The DNA in the trash belonged to a close relative of whoever had left DNA on the knife sheath.
Mr. Kohberger was arrested on Dec. 30.
"We have an individual in custody who committed these horrible crimes, and I do believe our community is safe," the police chief, Mr. Fry, announced. "But we still do need to be vigilant, right?"

The next day, records show, investigators in Moscow were also looking closely at another vehicle: Goncalves’ car. She had purchased a 2015 Range Rover in the days before her death. Detectives gathered information on the registration, history and legal owners, clearly interested in the history of who had owned the car. But once again, the information provided few answers.
With students at the University of Idaho preparing for final exams, there was a permanent sense of apprehension in the air, as people began locking their doors, acquiring pepper spray and asking on social media how such a brazen killer could remain undetected for so long in a town that had not seen a murder in seven years.
The hunt broadened as investigators vacuumed up more records and data. They had already sought cellphone data for all phones that pinged cell towers within a half-mile of the victims’ house from 3 to 5 a.m., according to search warrant filings. They collected victims’ bank records, email correspondence and social media account data.
On Dec. 5, detectives made a new request for surveillance video, seeking all footage recorded on UPS delivery trucks in the days before and after the killings.
The next day, after getting back data on Goncalves’ account on the Tinder dating app, detectives asked for details on 19 specific account holders, including their locations, credit card information and any “private images, pictures or videos” associated with the accounts.
The request allowed the inquiry to go much broader than an ordinary search for information, using a single warrant to target 19 people, said Orin Kerr, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
“You couldn’t get one warrant to search 19 houses,” he said.
Investigators were also working with a key piece of evidence: a Ka-Bar knife sheath, branded with a U.S. Marine Corps logo, that had been found next to two of the victims. They initially began looking for local stores that may have sold the weapon, and then fanned out.
A request to Amazon sought the order histories of account holders who had purchased such knives. A follow-up request to eBay focused on a series of specific users, seeking their purchase histories. Some had connections to the area — including one in Idaho and two in Washington state — while others were from far away, including an account in Japan. Because of redactions, it is unclear if Kohberger’s name came up in those records.
The overall data track was growing enormous, demonstrating the extensive breadth of data on consumer platforms that can be made accessible to law enforcement agencies when they are at the stage of hunting for breadcrumbs.
“You could say this is uncharted territory,” Kerr said. “They are novel legal questions when there are so many records out there.”
At the same time, DNA from the scene was being processed. Forensic teams had examined the knife sheath and found DNA that did not belong to any of the inhabitants of the house. They ran the sample through the FBI’s database, which contains millions of DNA profiles of past criminal offenders, but according to three people briefed on the case, they did not get a match.
At that point, investigators decided to try genetic genealogy, a method that until now has been used primarily to solve cold cases, not active murder investigations. Among the growing number of genealogy websites that help people trace their ancestors and relatives via their own DNA, some allow users to select an option that permits law enforcement to compare crime scene DNA samples against the websites’ data.
A distant cousin who has opted into the system can help investigators building a family tree from crime scene DNA to triangulate and identify a potential perpetrator of a crime. In one of the best-known uses of genealogy in solving a cold case, detectives in 2018 were able to arrest a suspect in a string of rapes and murders years before in California that had been attributed to the so-called Golden State Killer.
Once a suspect is identified, a direct genetic comparison can be used as confirmation before making an arrest.
With few formal regulations, the use of mass genealogy databases has raised concerns about privacy and whether limits should be placed on how the method is used. But authorities across the country say they have found potential in the system to produce leads that are unattainable through traditional investigative efforts.
Barbara Rae-Venter, a genealogy consultant who worked on the Golden State Killer case, said there was now growing interest in using genealogical DNA not just in cold cases but also in active crime investigations.
“That is why the Idaho case is so interesting,” she said.
To do the genealogical analysis, the Idaho State Police contracted with a private company, Othram, in Texas, which had a lab able to produce a more extensive DNA profile from the knife sheath than the state lab was set up to examine.
FBI personnel worked with the profile that Othram had produced, according to two people familiar with the investigation, spending days building out a family tree that began with a distant relative.
By the morning of Dec. 19, records show, investigators had a name: Bryan Kohberger. He had a white Elantra. He was a student at a university 8 miles from the scene of the killings.
Kohberger was already out of town, his semester complete. He had driven home with his father to Pennsylvania, stopped twice by police along the way for what officers said was tailgating. Just as agents began to scour his background more thoroughly, he had been terminated from his position as a teaching assistant, after what was described as altercations with a professor.
On Dec. 23, investigators sought and received Kohberger’s cellphone records. The results added more to their suspicions: His phone was moving around in the early morning hours of Nov. 13, but was disconnected from cell networks — perhaps turned off — in the two hours around when the killings occurred.
Four days later, agents in Pennsylvania managed to retrieve some trash from Kohberger’s family residence, sending the material to the Idaho State Police forensic lab. Checking it against the original DNA profile, the lab was able to reach a game-changing conclusion: The DNA in the trash belonged to a close relative of whomever had left DNA on the knife sheath.
Kohberger was arrested Dec. 30.
“We have an individual in custody who committed these horrible crimes, and I do believe our community is safe,” the police chief, Fry, announced. “But we still do need to be vigilant, right?”

Full text: The facility is the second battery project under development in the state by Hyundai Motor Group and may bring 3,000 jobs.
Hyundai Motor Group and LG Energy Solutions announced plans on Thursday to build a $ 4.3 billion electric vehicle battery plant in Georgia, the latest clean energy facility to come to the state.
The project is expected to bring 3,000 new jobs to southeast Georgia by the end of 2025. It is the second battery manufacturing plant that Hyundai is developing in the state, which has used incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act to open new facilities. Hyundai announced in December that it had teamed up with SK On, a South Korean electric vehicle battery developer, to build a plant in Bartow County.
"Hyundai Motor Group is focusing on its electrification efforts to secure a leadership position in the global auto industry," Jaehoon Chang, president and chief executive of Hyundai Motor Company, said in a statement.
The facility is planned for Bryan County, Ga., near the Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America, which is under construction, the company said. The Metaplant facility will produce Hyundai, Genesis and Kia electric vehicles.
Senator Jon Ossoff, a Georgia Democrat, said in an interview that incentives for clean energy manufacturing in the Inflation Reduction Act made the plant possible.
"This is yet another huge win for Georgia," he said.
In April, Mr. Ossoff led a trade mission to South Korea, where he met with senior executives from both companies.
The announcement followed a decision in January by Hanwha QCells to tap the federal climate and tax measure to expand its operations with a $ 2.5 billion Georgia facility that will produce solar panels and their components.

No Plea Made By Suspect In the Killing Of 4 in Idaho: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Bryan Kohberger, the former Ph.D. student accused of killing four University of Idaho students, appeared in court Monday after being indicted on murder charges.
The man accused of murdering four college students during a predawn intrusion at their house near the University of Idaho declined to enter a plea to the charges Monday, electing to "stand silent" during the first step in what promises to be a lengthy legal process.
Judge John C. Judge said he would enter a not-guilty plea for the defendant, Bryan Kohberger, after Mr. Kohberger's lawyer, Anne Taylor, said her client had elected not to enter any plea at this stage. Mr. Kohberger has said through a lawyer in the past that he expects to be exonerated.
A trial was set to begin in October in Moscow, the quiet Idaho college town that had not recorded a murder in the seven years before the four students were killed Nov. 13.
Investigators have said in court records that they linked Mr. Kohberger to the killings with the help of DNA found on a knife sheath at the crime scene, as well as through surveillance video that showed a car similar to his near the house around the time of the killings.
At that time, Mr. Kohberger was studying for a doctorate in criminology at Washington State University, a few miles across the state border from the University of Idaho campus. Prosecutors have not disclosed any prior connections between him and any of the four victims -- Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20.
In the hours before the killings, Ms. Mogen and Ms. Goncalves were out at a bar, and they stopped at a food truck before returning home. Ms. Kernodle and Mr. Chapin were at a party.
Investigators said that the victims and two other people who lived in the house were home by 2 a.m. on Nov. 13. After that, investigators have said, surveillance video showed a white car appearing repeatedly next to the house. Mr. Kohberger drove a white Hyundai Elantra.
The authorities said Mr. Kohberger's cellphone was moving through the region in the early morning hours, but was disconnected from cell networks -- perhaps it had been turned off, they said -- during a two-hour period around the time of the killings.
Investigators spent weeks looking for a suspect in the case. Eventually, they learned that DNA they had found on the knife sheath was related to DNA they found at Mr. Kohberger's family home in Pennsylvania, where Mr. Kohberger had gone in early December at the end of the fall semester.
The semester ended with Mr. Kohberger embroiled in turmoil on his own campus, where officials investigated two altercations he had with a professor and complaints about his conduct around women. Mr. Kohberger was terminated from his teaching assistant position several weeks after the killings. He was arrested in Pennsylvania on Dec. 30.
Mr. Kohberger's lawyers had been preparing for a lengthy preliminary hearing in the case that was scheduled to take place at the end of June, but a grand jury indictment last week made that hearing unnecessary. Much of the evidence gathered by prosecutors that could have been made public at such a hearing will instead remain undisclosed for now.
Mr. Kohberger arrived at the hearing Monday in an orange jumpsuit, with shackles around his ankles. As he looked out across the packed courtroom toward a group of relatives of the victims, they stared at him in silence.
Mr. Kohberger repeatedly responded "yes" as he was asked whether he understood each of the charges against him, and whether he understood that he could face life in prison or the death penalty if convicted on each of the four murder counts.
The refusal to enter a plea at this point is unlikely to have a significant impact on the case, said Eve Brensike Primus, a law professor at the University of Michigan and an expert in criminal procedure.
Ms. Primus said that lawyers may recommend that course when they expect to argue that their client is not competent to stand trial or is not guilty by reason of insanity.
Idaho is one of four states that do not provide explicitly for insanity pleas, but defendants in the state can introduce testimony at trial to show that, as a result of mental illness, they are not guilty of certain elements of a crime, like the "malice aforethought" that must be proved in order for a jury to convict a defendant of murder.
Another possible explanation, Ms. Primus said, is that Mr. Kohberger did not want to tell the court he was not guilty. In that situation, his lawyer might decide on standing silent, allowing Mr. Kohberger to avoid pleading out loud, while still moving the case forward as if he had pleaded not guilty.
"Practically, there is no difference in effect," Ms. Primus said. "But if there are mental health issues, there might be reasons why you might not want your client to speak in court."
The hearing on Monday started the clock on a 60-day period in which prosecutors must decide whether to seek the death penalty in the case. The parents of one victim, Ms. Goncalves, have said they want the death penalty if Mr. Kohberger is convicted.
In a statement after the hearing on Monday, the Goncalves family said the hearing was "just the beginning of a long journey for all the families."

Suspect Indicted in Fatal Stabbing of 4 University of Idaho Students: [National Desk]

Full text: Instead of facing a preliminary hearing, the Ph.D. student accused of killing four University of Idaho students will be arraigned on murder charges next week.
The man accused of fatally stabbing four University of Idaho students last year has been indicted by a grand jury and will be arraigned on murder charges next week, a court spokesman said Wednesday.
The suspect, Bryan Kohberger, a former graduate student in criminology at a nearby university, was arrested in the case in December but has yet to enter a plea. Defense lawyers had moved to hold an extended preliminary hearing, scheduled for next month, that would have explored much of the evidence collected by investigators, but the grand jury indictment eliminates that process.
The authorities have yet to describe a motive or lay out many details of the killings, in which the four victims were stabbed to death in the predawn hours one Sunday in November in a house not far from campus. They have not detailed any prior connections between Mr. Kohberger and the victims, Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20.
Mr. Kohberger, originally from Pennsylvania, had been a Ph.D. student studying criminology at Washington State University in Pullman, just across the state border from the Idaho campus. Investigators have said they linked him to the scene with DNA found on a knife sheath in the home, apparently matching that sample to his father after testing trash at the family's home.
Mr. Kohberger drove a white Hyundai Elantra that appeared to match a vehicle seen on surveillance footage near the home, investigators have said. An affidavit filed by the police said that Mr. Kohberger's phone was detected moving around the region in the hours before and after the killings but that it was disconnected from cell networks, perhaps turned off, for about two hours around the time of the killings.
The case has upended life in the community of Moscow, Idaho, which had not recorded a murder in seven years. Residents of the town spent weeks in uncertainty as investigators struggled to find a suspect. In recent days, at graduation ceremonies, the University of Idaho honored the four victims with posthumous degrees or certificates.
Mr. Kohberger has said through a public defender that he expects to be exonerated. Nate Poppino, a court spokesman, said that Mr. Kohberger would be arraigned on the new indictment at a hearing scheduled for Monday morning.
Former friends and his own online postings have detailed Mr. Kohberger's troubled past, including emotional problems and heroin use that he struggled with in his teenage years. He had appeared to turn his life around after getting clean and focusing on his studies, they reported, and he had said that he hoped to one day provide counseling for high-profile criminals.
But after arriving at Washington State University last year, he appeared to run into new trouble. The university counseled him over a verbal altercation he had with a professor and investigated his conduct with women around the time of the killings. He was ultimately fired from his job as a teaching assistant in December, shortly before his arrest at his parents' home in Pennsylvania.

Electric Work Vans Find Eager Buyers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Passenger cars dominate the electric vehicle market, but light delivery trucks could benefit from the cost savings and range E.V.s offer.
Not long after buying a Ford E-Transit van for his plumbing business last November, Mitch Smedley sat down with some receipts and a calculator to figure out how much the electric vehicle was saving him on fuel expenses.
A few minutes of number crunching showed he was spending about $ 110 to $ 140 a week on fuel for each of the four older, diesel Transits in his fleet. Then he worked out how much electricity he was using to charge the electric model to drive the same distance -- about 300 miles a week. The cost: about $ 9 a week.
"I knew there was going to be some savings because our electricity here is very inexpensive," said Mr. Smedley, whose business is based in Blue Springs, Mo., just east of Kansas City. "But I was amazed when I worked it out. It makes it really, really cheap to operate."
In the auto industry's transition to electric vehicles, passenger vehicles have led the way. In the first quarter of 2023, sales of E.V.s were up 45 percent from a year earlier, to 259,000 cars and trucks, according to Cox Automotive, a research firm. Tesla remains the largest seller by far, while General Motors, Ford Motor, Hyundai, Volkswagen and others are selling multiple electric models. Cox expects the annual E.V. sales total in the U.S. market to top one million this year for the first time.
So far, commercial light vehicles are a small proportion of all electric cars and trucks sold, but in many ways battery-powered vehicles are well suited for work fleets. Since trucks and delivery vans often travel limited distances or established routes each day, they don't need large and expensive battery packs. Most can get by with enough energy to travel about 100 miles before they need a recharge.
One factor that makes electric cars significantly more expensive than internal combustion models is that consumers want the ability to travel 250 or 300 miles on a single charge because they fear being stranded far from any place to plug in. Commercial vehicles are typically parked overnight in lots where they can be easily charged and ready to go with a full battery in the morning.
Electric trucks also require less maintenance than traditional vehicles. They don't need oil changes and have no transmissions, mufflers or fuel pumps that can wear out or break down. And they don't burn fuel when idling.
More so than consumers, commercial fleet owners look closely at the total cost of owning and operating vehicles over several years. That means they are often willing to accept a higher initial price to buy an electric truck to save money over time through lower fuel and maintenance costs.
Yet commercial E.V.s have had a slower start in sales, in part because of the troubles of several companies that had hoped to make them. Start-ups like Lordstown Motors, Arrival and Canoo have struggled to start or ramp up production, as has Workhorse, a small manufacturer of commercial trucks. Rivian, a start-up backed by Amazon, had hoped to sell thousands of electric vans to the online retailer by now but has fallen far short of its goals.
The delays created an opening for Ford and G.M., two of the country's largest automakers, to bring out their own battery-powered work trucks. The E-Transit, a derivative of Ford's Transit commercial van, is available in various sizes and can be used as a delivery van, a shuttle bus, or a work truck for contractors, repairmen, plumbers and other small businesses.
Ford sold about 6,500 E-Transits last year. In March, the United States Postal Service ordered 9,250 E-Transits that are supposed to go into service by the end of 2024.
G.M. created an independent division, BrightDrop, to make a larger vehicle tailored for package and cargo delivery. BrightDrop produced a test fleet of about 500 battery-powered vans that were delivered to customers in 2022, and started commercial production of its Zevo 600 model at a plant in Ontario this year.
Along with the truck, BrightDrop has developed an electric cart to enable drivers to haul many packages from the truck, reducing the number of trips the driver makes back and forth. One version of the cart is refrigerated for deliveries of produce and groceries.
In Hooksett, N.H., Merchants Fleet, a company that manages vehicles used by delivery services, has been using 150 BrightDrop vans over the past year, and is eager to add more.
Brad Jacobs, the company's vice president for fleet consulting, said the depreciation cost and the cost of interest on the capital used to buy electric vans were roughly the same as for combustion engine trucks.
"What we've learned from the vehicles on the road is that you save anywhere from $ 10,000 to $ 12,000 a year because the cost of fuel and maintenance is so much lower with electric vehicles," he said. "If a company is planning on service life of five years, that's a savings of $ 50,000 per vehicle. That's very compelling."
Merchants Fleet has orders for 750 more BrightDrop trucks and reservations on an additional 17,000, Mr. Jacobs said.
Large delivery companies have been clamoring for electric trucks for years. Amazon hopes to buy as many as 100,000 vans from Rivian, and is considering an electric Ram ProMaster van that Chrysler's parent company, Stellantis, is supposed to start making this year.
UPS has ordered 10,000 electric vans from Arrival, a start-up company based in Luxembourg that has operations in Britain. Arrival has suffered financial troubles and production delays. FedEx, plans to buy only battery-powered vans starting in 2030, and hopes to operate an all-electric fleet by 2040. It has been testing 150 BrightDrop trucks, is taking delivery on 350 more and has reservations for an additional 2,000.
Nelson Granados, a FedEx delivery driver in Inglewood, Calif., has been using a BrightDrop vehicle for the past year, a white van with the orange-and-purple FedEx logo next to a picture of a bright green plug and electric cord.
Mr. Granados gives the truck a thumbs-up. The truck has comforts the diesel vans lack like a stereo and heated seats, as well as a lower floor that makes entering and leaving easier.
"You're getting in and out all day, so it pays off," Mr. Granados said. "It's like a luxury delivery truck."
Mr. Smedley, the plumber in the Kansas City area, has noticed benefits from his E-Transit besides fuel savings. At job sites, the truck can power equipment like drain-cleaning machines, eliminating the need to lug around a generator. He began taking the van to Kansas City Chiefs football games -- he has season tickets -- so he can use its electric outlets for tailgating parties. The truck also secures him premium parking in the spots at Arrowhead Stadium reserved for electric vehicles.
This year, Mr. Smedley decided to add a second electric model to his fleet, a Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck. He has also continued tracking the savings he's reaping from the E-Transit.

Not long after buying a Ford E-Transit van for his plumbing business in November, Mitch Smedley sat down with some receipts and a calculator to figure out how much the electric vehicle was saving him on fuel expenses.
A few minutes of number crunching showed he was spending about $110 to $140 a week on fuel for each of the four older, diesel Transits in his fleet. Then he worked out how much electricity he was using to charge the electric model to drive the same distance — about 300 miles a week. The cost: about $9 a week.
“I knew there was going to be some savings because our electricity here is very inexpensive,” said Smedley, whose business is based in Blue Springs, Missouri, just east of Kansas City. “But I was amazed when I worked it out. It makes it really, really cheap to operate.”
In the auto industry’s transition to electric vehicles, passenger vehicles have led the way. In the first quarter of 2023, sales of EVs were up 45% from a year earlier, to 259,000 cars and trucks, according to Cox Automotive, a research firm. Tesla remains the largest seller by far, while General Motors, Ford Motor, Hyundai, Volkswagen and others are selling multiple electric models. Cox expects the annual EV sales total in the U.S. market to top 1 million this year for the first time.
So far, commercial light vehicles are a small proportion of all electric cars and trucks sold, but in many ways battery-powered vehicles are well suited for work fleets. Since trucks and delivery vans often travel limited distances or established routes each day, they don’t need large and expensive battery packs. Most can get by with enough energy to travel about 100 miles before they need a recharge. One factor that makes electric cars significantly more expensive than internal combustion models is that consumers want the ability to travel 250 or 300 miles on a single charge because they fear being stranded far from any place to plug in.
Commercial vehicles are typically parked overnight in lots where they can be easily charged and ready to go with a full battery in the morning. Electric trucks also require less maintenance than traditional vehicles. They don’t need oil changes and have no transmissions, mufflers or fuel pumps that can wear out or break down. And they don’t burn fuel when idling.
More so than consumers, commercial fleet owners look closely at the total cost of owning and operating vehicles over several years. That means they are often willing to accept a higher initial price to buy an electric truck to save money over time through lower fuel and maintenance costs.
Yet, commercial EVs have had a slower start in sales, in part because of the troubles of several companies that had hoped to make them. Startups like Lordstown Motors, Arrival and Canoo have struggled to start or ramp up production, as has Workhorse, a small manufacturer of commercial trucks. Rivian, a startup backed by Amazon, had hoped to sell thousands of electric vans to the online retailer by now but has fallen far short of its goals.
The delays created an opening for Ford and GM, two of the country’s largest automakers, to bring out their own battery-powered work trucks. The E-Transit, a derivative of Ford’s Transit commercial van, is available in various sizes and can be used as a delivery van, a shuttle bus, or as a work truck for contractors, repairmen, plumbers and other small businesses.
Ford sold about 6,500 E-Transits last year. In March, the U.S. Postal Service ordered 9,250 E-Transits that are supposed to go into service by the end of 2024.
GM created an independent division, BrightDrop, to make a larger vehicle tailored for package and cargo delivery. BrightDrop produced a test fleet of about 500 battery-powered vans that were delivered to customers in 2022 and started commercial production of its Zevo 600 model at a plant in Ontario this year.
Along with the truck, BrightDrop has developed an electric cart to enable drivers to haul many packages from the truck, reducing the number of trips the driver makes back and forth. One version of the cart is refrigerated for deliveries of produce and groceries.
In Hooksett, New Hampshire, Merchants Fleet, a company that manages vehicles used by delivery services, has been using 150 BrightDrop vans over the past year and is eager to add more.
Brad Jacobs, the company’s vice president for fleet consulting, said the depreciation cost and the cost of interest on the capital used to buy electric vans were roughly the same as for combustion engine trucks.
“What we’ve learned from the vehicles on the road is that you save anywhere from $10,000 to $12,000 a year because the cost of fuel and maintenance is so much lower with electric vehicles,” he said. “If a company is planning on service life of five years, that’s a savings of $50,000 per vehicle. That’s very compelling.”
Merchants Fleet has orders for 750 more BrightDrop trucks and reservations on an additional 17,000, Jacobs said.
Large delivery companies have been clamoring for electric trucks for years. Amazon hopes to buy as many as 100,000 vans from Rivian and is considering an electric Ram ProMaster van that Chrysler’s parent company, Stellantis, is supposed to start making this year.
UPS has ordered 10,000 electric vans from Arrival, a startup company based in Luxembourg that has operations in Britain. Arrival has suffered financial troubles and production delays. FedEx plans to buy only battery-powered vans starting in 2030 and hopes to operate an all-electric fleet by 2040. It has been testing 150 BrightDrop trucks, is taking delivery on 350 more and has reservations for an additional 2,000.
Nelson Granados, a FedEx delivery driver in Inglewood, California, has been using a BrightDrop vehicle for the past year, a white van with the orange-and-purple FedEx logo next to a picture of a bright green plug and electric cord.
Granados gives the truck a thumbs-up. The truck has comforts the diesel vans lack like a stereo and heated seats, as well as a lower floor that makes entering and leaving easier.
“You’re getting in and out all day, so it pays off,” Granados said. “It’s like a luxury delivery truck.”
Smedley, the plumber in the Kansas City area, has noticed benefits from his E-Transit besides fuel savings. At job sites, the truck can power equipment like drain-cleaning machines, eliminating the need to lug around a generator. He began taking the van to Kansas City Chiefs football games — he has season tickets — so he can use its electric outlets for tailgating parties. The truck also secures him premium parking in the spots at Arrowhead Stadium reserved for electric vehicles.
This year, Smedley decided to add a second electric model to his fleet, a Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck. He has also continued tracking the savings he’s reaping from the E-Transit.
“When I look at the cost over five years,” he said with a laugh, “it’s almost like getting a free van.”

Labor Victory in South With a Vote to Unionize: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Friday's victory by the United Steelworkers at a factory building electric school buses was a test for Democratic hopes that clean-energy funding from Washington could bolster organized labor.
Workers at a rural Georgia factory that builds electric school buses under generous federal subsidies voted to unionize on Friday, handing organized labor and Democrats a surprise victory in their hopes to turn huge new infusions of money from Washington into a union beachhead in the Deep South.
The company, Blue Bird in Fort Valley, Ga., may lack the cachet of Amazon or the ubiquity of Starbucks, two other corporations that have attracted union attention. But the 697-to-435 vote by Blue Bird's workers to join the United Steelworkers was the first significant organizing election at a factory receiving major federal funding under legislation signed by President Biden.
"This is just a bellwether for the future, particularly in the South, where working people have been ignored," Liz Shuler, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said Friday evening after the vote. "We are now in a place where we have the investments coming in and a strategy for lifting up wages and protections for a good high-road future."
The three bills making up that investment include a $ 1 trillion infrastructure package, a $ 280 billion measure to rekindle a domestic semiconductor industry and the Inflation Reduction Act, which included $ 370 billion for clean energy to combat climate change.
Each of the bills included language to help unions expand their membership, and Blue Bird's management, which opposed the union drive, had to contend with the Democrats' subtle assistance to the Steelworkers.
Blue Bird stands to benefit from the new federal funds. Last year, it hailed the $ 500 million that the Biden administration was providing through the infrastructure bill for the replacement of diesel-powered school buses with zero- and low-emission buses. Georgia school systems alone will get $ 51.1 million to buy new electric buses, but Blue Bird sells its buses across the country. Still more money will come through the Inflation Reduction Act, another law praised by the company.
But that money came with strings attached -- strings that subtly tilted the playing field toward the union. Just two weeks ago, for instance, the Environmental Protection Agency, which administers the Clean School Bus Program, pushed a demand on all recipients of federal subsidies to detail the health insurance, paid leave, retirement and other benefits they were offering their workers.
They also required the companies to have "committed to remain neutral in any organizing campaign and/or to voluntarily recognize a union based on a show of majority support." And under the rules of the infrastructure bill, no federal money may to be used to thwart a union election.
The Steelworkers union used the rules to its advantage. In late April, it filed multiple unfair labor practice charges against Blue Bird's management, citing $ 40 million in rebates the company had received from the E.P.A., which stipulated that those funds could not be used for anti-union activity.
"The rules say if workers want a union, you can't use any money to hire anti-union law firms, or use people to scare workers," Daniel Flippo, director of the Steelworkers district that covers the Southeast, said before the vote. "I'm convinced Blue Bird has done that."
Politicians also got involved. Georgia's two Democratic senators and southwestern Georgia's Democratic House member also subtly nudged the plant's management, in a union-hostile but politically pivotal state, to at least keep the election fair.
"I have been a longtime supporter of the USW and its efforts to improve labor conditions and living standards for workers in Georgia," the Democratic congressman, Representative Sanford Bishop, wrote of the United Steelworkers in an open letter to Blue Bird workers. "I want to encourage you in your effort to exercise your rights granted by the National Labor Relations Act."
Blue Bird's management minimized such pressure in its public statements, even as it fought hard to beat back union organizers.
"Although we respect and support the right for employees to choose, we do not believe that Blue Bird is better served by injecting a labor union into our relationship with employees," said Julianne Barclay, a spokeswoman for the company. "During the pending election campaign, we have voiced our opinion to our employees that a union is not in the best interest of the company or our employees."
Friday's union victory has the labor movement thinking big as the federal money continues to flow, and that could be good for Mr. Biden and other Democrats, especially in the pivotal state of Georgia.
"Workers at places like Blue Bird, in many ways, embody the future," Mr. Flippo said after the vote, adding, "For too long, corporations cynically viewed the South as a place where they could suppress wages and working conditions because they believed they could keep workers from unionizing."
The Blue Bird union shop, 1,400 workers strong, will be one of the biggest in the South, and union leaders said it could be a beachhead as they eyed new electric vehicle suppliers moving in -- and potentially the biggest, most difficult targets: foreign electric vehicle makers like Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz and BMW, which have located in Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina in part to avoid unions.
"Companies move there for a reason -- they want as smooth a path toward crushing unions as possible," said Steve Smith, a national spokesman for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "But we have federal money rolling in, a friendly administration and a chance to make inroads like we have never had before."
The Blue Bird plant, which rises suddenly off a rural highway lined with peach and pecan orchards, has long made it a practice to hire less educated workers, some of whom have prison records and most of whom start at $ 16 or $ 17 an hour, said Alex Perkins, a main organizer for the United Steelworkers in Georgia.
A union was a tough sell for such vulnerable workers against a management that was fiercely opposed, organizers conceded. Coming off the last shift of the day on Thursday, most workers declined to speak on the record. A clutch of about a dozen workers stood on Friday at the Circle K gas station across the street from the plant in the predawn darkness, holding pro-union signs as the first workers arrived to cast ballots under the gaze of National Labor Relations Board monitors.
But Cynthia Harden, who has worked at the plant for five years and voted in favor of organizing, did talk about the pressure workers were under to vote against it. Slide shows on the voting process, which showed ballots marked "no," said that the company could go broke if the union won, and there was a sudden appearance of food trucks at lunch and banners on the perimeter fence reading, "We Love Our Employees!"
"They've made some changes already, but if the union hadn't started, nothing would have happened," she said.
The letter that Georgia's Democratic senators, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, wrote to Matt Stevenson, Blue Bird's chief executive and president, was remarkably timid, praising the company for its cooperation and its well-paying jobs before "encouraging all involved, whatever their desired outcome, to make sure that the letter and the spirit of the National Labor Relations Act are followed."
Mr. Perkins fumed at that tone, considering the work that unions had put in to help Mr. Warnock win re-election last year. "I won't forget it next time," he said.
Both senators declined requests to comment on the election.

BTS Plans To Publish Oral History Of the Group: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The announcement by their U.S. publisher, Flatiron Books, came after days of frantic speculation by their fervent fans.
The K-pop juggernaut BTS will release an oral history of the group in South Korea and the United States on July 9, its U.S. publisher, Flatiron Books, said on Thursday.
The book, "Beyond The Story: 10-Year Record of BTS," was written by the journalist Myeongseok Kang and members of the group, and it will be published in South Korea by Big Hit Music.
The news confirms intense fan speculation over several days that Flatiron would publish a nonfiction title about a pop culture phenomenon this summer. The rumor spread once booksellers in the United States noticed last weekend that a mystery title with a July 9 release date was coming. It had an initial print run of one million copies and required booksellers to sign an affidavit to stock copies on publication day.
Fans searched for clues of who the mystery author might be, zeroing in at first on Taylor Swift and citing her frequent use of the number 13 as evidence. (The book's original announcement was slated for June 13.) Swift had also highlighted the date July 9 in her most recent album announcement.
But June 13 and July 9 are also significant dates in the BTS community. The group debuted on the first date, and BTS's passionate fan base, Army -- which stands for Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth -- was founded on the second. The book's release will coincide with the fan group's 10th anniversary.
As speculations mounted, preorders drove the still-untitled book up best-seller lists at Amazon and Barnes & Noble.
The English translation of the book was led by Anton Hur, in collaboration with Clare Richards and Slin Jung. The U.S. edition will be 544 pages and contain exclusive photographs, according to Flatiron, and will have a first printing of one million copies.
The group's powerful, very online fandom has become famous worldwide, known for supporting the group by buying multiple versions of each physical release and running intricately coordinated social media campaigns. Devotees also assist each other by translating BTS content into English and other languages and providing robust fan communities.
It is difficult to overstate BTS's influence, in music and beyond. Last year, the seven members of the group -- RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook -- visited the White House to speak against anti-Asian American hate crimes.
Since 2013, BTS has released nine albums and six EPs and helped K-pop become a dominant global force. In 2018, the group became the first K-pop act to hit No. 1 on Billboard's album chart with "Love Yourself: Tear," a feat it repeated twice in 2019 with "Love Yourself: Answer" and "Map of the Soul: Persona" -- matching a record set by the Beatles.
In June 2022, after yet another No. 1 album -- the three-disc compilation "Proof" -- BTS released a video on social media announcing it was going on hiatus so its members could focus on solo creative projects. "I should be writing about what I'm feeling and the stories I want to tell," Suga said, "but I'm just forcefully squeezing out words because I need to satisfy someone." The clip drew more than 16 million views in two days. In October of last year, the group's label confirmed that its members would enlist in South Korea's military as required by law. Some of them already have.
The hiatus was devastating news not only for BTS's fervent fan base, but also for the entertainment business. The day after the news broke, the stock price for Hybe, the South Korean entertainment company behind the group, dropped 28 percent, which shaved $ 1.7 billion off its market value. As the group's popularity has grown, it has become a pillar of South Korea's economy, contributing $ 3.5 billion annually by 2020, according to the Hyundai Research Institute.
Many fans say that while they are drawn to BTS's music and performances, they are also inspired by its messages of love and acceptance, which have led some to become more politically active. "They're really, really passionate people who just fight for what they love," Nicole Santero, a fan who ran a data-focused BTS Twitter account, told The Times in 2020. "Those characteristics translate well when you look at social issues."

Ford Motor Made $1.8 Billion As Shortage of Parts Eased: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sales increased from a year earlier, when the automaker was hampered by parts shortages.
Ford Motor reported a solid profit in the first quarter, although the automaker indicated that its turnaround was not complete and that it had a ways to go before it starts making money on electric vehicles.
On Tuesday, the company said it made $ 1.8 billion in profit in the first three months of 2023 as a result of a substantial increase in revenue and in the number of vehicles it sold around the world, the company said Tuesday.
The positive result is a recovery from the same period a year ago, when the automaker lost $ 3.1 billion as the value of its stake in the electric-vehicle maker Rivian declined.
In 2022, Ford was slowed by shortages of computer chips and other key parts that prevented it from making as many vehicles as it had expected.
"When you look at the core and the quarter, it's solid," the company's chief executive, Jim Farley, said in a conference call with analysts. "We saw growth across all our key metrics. Our balance sheet is strong."
For the first quarter, the company reported revenue of $ 41.5 billion, up 20 percent from $ 34.5 billion in the year-earlier period. Globally, Ford sold 1.1 million cars and trucks in the first quarter, compared with 966,000 in the first three months of 2022.
Ford, which is trying to streamline its operations and cut costs, reiterated a forecast of $ 9 billion to $ 11 billion in profit for the full year before interest and taxes.
For the first time, Ford reported separate results for its electric vehicle division. The E.V. business lost $ 700 million before interest and taxes in the first quarter, while a unit making traditional gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles doubled its profit to $ 2.6 billion.
The E.V. business is not yet producing vehicles in sufficient volumes to generate profits. It was especially slowed in the first quarter, when the company halted production of the F-150 Lightning pickup to fix a battery defect and stopped making the Mustang Mach-E, a sport-utility vehicle, to modify its plant to roughly double output.
The production disruptions caused Ford's sales of the Mach-E to fall about 20 percent, to just under 5,400 vehicles. Sales of the F-150 Lightning totaled almost 4,300 trucks. That was higher than a low figure from a year ago, when the truck was just going into production, but fewer than Ford had been hoping for.
Separately on Tuesday, Ford said it was lowering prices of most versions of the Mach-E by $ 3,000 to $ 4,000. The vehicle, introduced two years ago, now competes with similar electric S.U.V.s from Hyundai, Volkswagen, Nissan, Tesla and other manufacturers.
"It's a competitive segment," Mr. Farley said.
Mr. Farley said that over the course of this year, Ford would narrow its losses on those two vehicles and the E-Transit, a delivery van. He also predicted that those three models would be profitable before interest and taxes by the end of 2024.
A third line of business, Ford Pro, which produces commercial trucks and services for fleet operators, nearly tripled its earnings before interest and taxes to $ 1.4 billion.
In the past, Ford broke out its operations geographically. The new form of reporting is intended to show how fast the company's E.V. business is growing, in hopes of attracting investors.
Ford plans to give investors a closer look at its strategy and operations in a two-day conference this month.
The earnings announcement came after the markets closed. Ford shares were down about 2 percent in extended trading.

Full text: After matching on Hinge, Nick Matcheck and Lori Hu waited three months before meeting in person. By then, they had already decided to live together in Wisconsin.
Nicholas Brandon Matcheck arrived with a single red rose the first time he met Chunyu Hu face to face in June 2020 on a grand marble staircase in the lobby of the Kimpton Gray Hotel in Chicago.
"There was no initial shyness," said Mr. Matcheck, 40, who described their first kiss minutes later as "very natural."
He had boarded a nearly empty plane in San Francisco that morning, with a one-way ticket and a suitcase, for a weeklong stay in Chicago with Ms. Hu before they moved in together in Green Bay, Wis.
"I already knew what kind of person and partner he was going to be," said Ms. Hu, 38, who had matched with him three months earlier on the dating app Hinge while working remotely from her parents' house in Green Bay -- a temporary move during the Covid-19 lockdown after she felt hemmed in working from her small one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco.
Ms. Hu, who goes by Lori, came to the United States to be with her parents when she was 3 from a village outside Guangzhou, China. She graduated with a bachelor's degree in biomedical engineering and a master's in engineering management, both from Duke. She then received a joint master's in international studies and business administration from the University of Pennsylvania.
Ms. Hu, now a managing director at Vertex Ventures Healthcare, a life sciences venture capital fund based in San Francisco, often rolled her eyes during video meetings as she and her co-workers weighed in on the latest episodes of the Netflix reality show "Love Is Blind."
"It just felt so unbelievable," said Ms. Hu, who was skeptical of couples who can develop relationships and become engaged before actually seeing each other.
Her tune changed somewhat when one of her first Hinge matches in March 2020 was Mr. Matcheck.
Mr. Matcheck, whose previous marriage ended in divorce, was completing a master's in business administration at the University of California, Berkeley. He graduated cum laude with a bachelor's in political science from the University of California, Los Angeles, and also received a master's in international affairs from the University of California, San Diego.
From 2007 to 2016, Mr. Matcheck, who goes by Nick, was a naval aviator. He flew a Lockheed P-3 Orion aircraft, in the U.S. Navy, and was deployed to the Middle East and Latin America. A son of an Air Force fighter pilot, he was born in Madrid and is now based in San Francisco as a product manager at Supernal, Hyundai's advanced air mobility subsidiary.
They began speaking daily and bonded over '90s music like Savage Garden's "I Knew I Loved You." Their virtual dates included watching nostalgic films that hit home like "An Officer and a Gentleman" and "Sleepless in Seattle," and they soon even began exchanging good, old-fashioned love letters.

Though they had exchanged photos from their lives, "we didn't want to do FaceTime or video," said Ms. Hu, explaining that they wanted to save that 'aha!' moment for when they met face to face.
The couple planned a picnic by the Golden Gate Bridge for late April 2020, when Ms. Hu was set to return to San Francisco, which did not come to pass. On April 22, the night before her birthday, her father was rushed to the I.C.U. with Covid, and then her mother was also infected and hospitalized for a week.
"Nick would talk me through the night," said Ms. Hu, who sometimes dozed off on the phone.
She and her mother, who recovered after a couple of weeks, often stood outside the hospital to be close to her father. After 30 days in the I.C.U., her father died on a muggy day in May.
"You never know what happens in life," she said, quoting one of the last things her father told her.
In a surprise twist, after Mr. Matcheck graduated that spring and his lease was up, the Civil War-era brick country house Ms. Hu's family owned and rented out became available.
"We spoke about if it made sense for him to move to Wisconsin," she said. "He was onboard."
Mr. Matcheck soon took care of packing up his and Ms. Hu's apartments in San Francisco and put their furniture into storage.
"By the time I saw her apartment, I already knew I was in love with her," he said. "I ate the soup she froze, saw her artwork and arts and crafts," he added. "I respackled her walls."
When they finally met in Chicago, she described it as "a week of firsts," a sort of "rom-com montage," and she had already prepared a picnic for the second day.
"It was a surreal feeling meeting someone you already know and you're in love with," she said.
In January 2022, they moved back to San Francisco.
A few days after Thanksgiving that year, when they put up a Christmas tree, he slipped a ring onto her homemade gingerbread-people ornaments featuring their names. The ring went undetected all day.
That evening he prompted her to check out the battery-powered star atop the tree. As soon as she noticed the ring, Mr. Matcheck, who had made coq au vin to celebrate, was on one knee.
On April 16, Dr. Ling Bei, the bride's best friend, who was ordained by the Universal Life Church for the occasion, officiated the wedding before 80 guests at Viansa Winery in Sonoma, Calif. Ms. Hu's brother played Pachelbel's "Canon in D Major" on the violin as she walked down the aisle.
"It reminded me of her walking down the staircase in Chicago," Mr. Matcheck said. "It had that same speed, the slow deliberate walk. It's the same feeling. I knew it was the life I wanted then. I made the right decision again."

Credits and Debits of E.V. Shopping: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Buying an electric car has become much more complicated because of restrictions on which models qualify for a federal tax credit of up to $ 7,500.
Designed to accelerate the shift to electric cars among other climate goals, the Inflation Reduction Act has in practice made buying such vehicles a lot more complicated.
In August, the law ruled out the full tax credit of $ 7,500 for electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids assembled outside North America. That may make it harder for consumers to take the financial or psychological leap to buy a battery-powered car.
The Treasury Department further tightened those rules this week by requiring that a certain percentage of the components and minerals in car batteries are sourced from the United States or in countries that are its trade allies -- numbers that will increase over time.
Just 11 electric cars from four automakers -- Tesla, General Motors, Ford Motor and Volkswagen -- now qualify for the full tax credit; several others can qualify for a partial $ 3,750 credit. The list is expected to grow as more automakers reconfigure their supply chains.
The rules are already driving big changes in the buying and selling of electric cars. Some automakers whose models are no longer eligible are now pushing leased electric cars. That's because the law allows leased vehicles to qualify as commercial vehicles, which the Inflation Reduction Act exempts from the restrictions that apply to cars bought by individuals.
For many car buyers, the availability of the tax credit is critical. Electric vehicle prices have fallen in recent months, but they still cost $ 58,940 on average in March, nearly $ 11,000 more than a typical new car, according to Kelley Blue Book.
Ethan Derner of Portland, Ore., and his fiancée, Lorien Sekora, share two Kia electric cars. Mr. Derner had considered replacing his car with a new model that could drive farther on a charge, but he gave up after realizing that the vehicles he wanted were either too expensive or no more practical than his current car. He has extended the lease on his Kia Soul and is waiting for more affordable models that can qualify for a tax credit.
"The only other model I'm considering now is a Rivian, but that's out of my price range," Mr. Derner said. Rivian's electric luxury models like the R1T pickup truck and R1S S.U.V. are built in Illinois and qualify for a $ 3,750 credit.
"Until I can drive to Seattle and back with no anxiety," Mr. Derner added, "I'm not going to buy a new E.V. outright."
His experience is common. About 80 percent of people who were shopping for an electric vehicle recently surveyed by Cars.com said tax credits played a big role in their decision to buy an electric car and the vehicle they planned to buy.
Many industry experts and consumers have praised the multipronged mission of the law to curb greenhouse gas emissions, create jobs in the United States and blunt China's dominance in batteries and mineral processing. Since President Biden took office, automakers, battery and other companies have announced plans to spend more than $ 100 billion to electrify the U.S. auto industry.
Yet the rules could hinder the goal of getting more people to buy electric vehicles -- at least for the next few years.
"They made it complex for a reason, but in the meantime it's creating all kinds of chaos for consumers," said Chris Harto, senior policy analyst for Consumer Reports. "In the short term, it's absolutely going to hurt the companies that aren't eligible and help the companies that are."
The reshuffled credits appear to deal an especially tough hand to Hyundai Motor, which also owns the Kia and Genesis brands.
Models like the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6 have won industry accolades and impressed buyers with attractive designs and some of the fastest charging times of any electric cars. But they are built in South Korea and, thus, not eligible for any federal tax breaks.
Even as sales of all Hyundai and Kia cars jumped in the first three months of the year, the brands' electric vehicle sales fell more than 25 percent, according to Kelley Blue Book. Electric car sales on the whole soared to another record in the first quarter, on a pace to top one million cars in 2023, and now account for 7.2 percent of all new cars sold.
The credit rules have been changing fast. Last month, Genesis' first American-built model, the Electrified GV70 sport utility vehicle, began rolling off a Hyundai line in Alabama after 16 hours of assembly. Genesis executives had hoped that the model could qualify for a credit, but the car did not meet the tougher rules the Biden administration released this week.
To make up for the loss of the tax breaks, Hyundai and other automakers are trying to lure buyers through leases. Under the administration's broad interpretations of the law, leased electric cars are eligible for tax credits even if they are made overseas and are not subjected to the government's rules on sourcing requirements for battery components and minerals, household income caps and vehicle price thresholds.
Car dealers can pass along the commercial credit to consumers by lowering the price of the car in lease transactions, which could reduce monthly payments. Under the rules of thumb for auto financing, applying the full $ 7,500 credit to a lease could save consumers about $ 225 per month over three years, or $ 125 per month over five years, said Russell Datz, a spokesman for Volvo.
Volvo, which is based in Goteborg, Sweden, sells two electric models in the United States that are made at a factory in Belgium and do not qualify for federal tax credits. The automaker will start assembling a new S.U.V., the EX90, at its factory in South Carolina this year.
Consumers are getting the money-saving message. In September, after the law's passage, just 7 percent of consumers leased an electric vehicle, according to Edmunds.com. By March, leases accounted for 34 percent of the electric car market.
Gary Murphy, a retired educator in Castle Rock, Colo., leased an Ioniq 5 in February from a dealer that learned of the commercial credit the day before.
"We had no plans to lease a car," Mr. Murphy said. "But when they confirmed you can get $ 7,500 on a lease, or nothing to buy, that's too big an incentive to pass up."
Before tracking down the Ioniq 5, he waited for months for three different electric models, which were in short supply. When cars were available, many dealers demanded several thousand dollars more than manufacturers' suggested retail prices.
"You can get the credit, but you can't get the car," Mr. Murphy said.
The use of credits for leased vehicles has angered some automakers and lawmakers who say it subverts the intent of Congress. Consumers can lease any electric vehicle for the $ 7,500 credit. For example, a couple making more than $ 300,000 -- the income limit for married people for the tax credit -- can lease a $ 148,000 Mercedes-Benz AMG EQS and claim a $ 7,500 credit even though the car is made in Germany and far exceeds the $ 55,000 price cap for electric sedans to qualify for the credit.
Treasury officials have said their decision to allow a tax credit for leased cars is legally sound. The Inflation Reduction Act exempted commercial vehicles from the restrictions to encourage rental car companies, local governments and other owners of car and truck fleets to buy electric vehicles.
Of course, many consumers prefer buying and owning cars, in part to avoid lease limits on how much they can drive and penalties for excessive wear and tear.
José Muñoz, the chief executive of Hyundai and Genesis Motor North America, insists the loss of buyer credits puts his brands at a huge marketplace disadvantage. But the chairman of Hyundai's national dealer council, Kevin Reilly, said models like the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 would remain competitive despite their financial handicap.
The Ioniq 6, which recently went on sale, is the longest-range and most energy-efficient mass-market electric car in the United States. It can be driven up to 361 miles on a full charge and gets the equivalent of 140 miles to the gallon, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
"I think our customers will evaluate the full landscape, not just whether an E.V. qualifies for credit," said Mr. Reilly, the owner and president of Alexandria Hyundai in Virginia.
Mr. Reilly said leasing offered other advantages. People who are anxious about switching to battery-powered cars can try one without a long-term commitment or worrying about resale value. And as electric vehicle technology advances and more affordable models hit the market, customers can easily upgrade when their lease is up.
Still, some car buyers said they would buy only electric cars eligible for tax credits because they supported the aims of the Inflation Reduction Act.
Jonathan Quarles, an entrepreneur in Detroit, said he spent more than $ 150 per week to fill up a Ford Expedition to ferry his three daughters around town. He is considering replacing it with an electric Ford Mustang Mach-E, which is eligible for a $ 3,750 federal tax credit. After watching manufacturing jobs leave the country for decades, he said, he has little sympathy for automakers whose cars did not qualify for credits.
"My perspective is," he said, "you should have been building those factories way before the credit."

Full text: Rules that take effect on Tuesday will limit the $ 7,500 credits to electric cars made domestically with minerals from the U.S. or trade allies.
American brands like Tesla and General Motors will benefit most from rules that determine which electric vehicles qualify for tax credits starting on Tuesday. Foreign carmakers like Hyundai will be at a significant disadvantage because of restrictions aimed at cutting China out of the supply chain.
Only 10 vehicles will initially qualify for tax credits of $ 7,500, less than a quarter of the battery-powered cars on sale in the United States. But those 10 include many of the most popular models and accounted for two-thirds of electric vehicle sales before the new rules took effect.
Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y, the best-selling electric vehicles in the United States, will qualify for the full $ 7,500 credit, with one exception, according to a list published by the Treasury Department on Monday. The least expensive version of the Model 3 will qualify for only half the credit because its battery is made in China.
G.M.'s Chevrolet Bolt, one of the cheapest electric vehicles on the market, will also qualify, as will sport utility vehicles and pickups that the company plans to begin selling this year.
Fewer Ford vehicles will qualify for the full $ 7,500 credit because of rules requiring that a certain percentage of the battery components and minerals like lithium come from either domestic sources or trade allies. Ford's Mustang Mach-E, the third-best-selling electric vehicle in the United States last year, according to Kelley Blue Book, will be eligible for only half the credit because its Polish-made battery does not meet domestic sourcing requirements. The F-150 Lightning pickup will continue to qualify for the full credit.
Chrysler and Jeep, divisions of Stellantis, do not yet sell cars that run solely on batteries, but several of their hybrid models will qualify for at least some of the credit. Hybrid vehicles can qualify if their batteries have a capacity of at least seven kilowatt-hours.
The rules give U.S. carmakers at least a temporary advantage over competitors like Toyota, Volkswagen and Nissan. No foreign automakers were on the Treasury list, which is expected to grow as companies adjust their supply chains.
Carmakers that qualify for the tax credits will now have a head start as sales of electric vehicles take off. "It causes a multiplier effect in the market," Paul Jacobson, G.M.'s chief financial officer, told reporters in New York this month. The rules, he added, are "very consistent with the strategy that we had already adopted."
The rules grow out of the Inflation Reduction Act, which Democrats passed last year to fight climate change and encourage domestic manufacturing among other things. The Treasury Department was responsible for writing regulations based on the legislation.
The law seeks to reduce the auto industry's reliance on China, which makes most of the world's batteries and dominates the processing of raw materials. The law also establishes limits on sales prices and excludes individuals who earn more than $ 150,000 a year and couples who make more than $ 300,000. The rules also exclude vehicles made outside North America, including in allied countries like South Korea and Germany.
"We were not happy," José Muñoz, the chief executive of Hyundai and Genesis Motor North America, said in an interview at the New York International Auto Show this month. Hyundai's Ioniq 6 electric sedan was named World Car of the Year at the show, but will not be eligible for tax credits because it is assembled in South Korea.
Hyundai, based in Seoul, is investing $ 10 billion to build car and battery plants in Georgia, which will allow the company to meet the Inflation Reduction Act requirements -- but not for several years.
Officials at the carmaker and the South Korean government asked the Biden administration to allow Hyundai and Kia cars to qualify for credits while the factories were under construction, but were told that the law did not allow such an exception, Mr. Muñoz said.
The Hyundai car factory in Georgia is expected to begin producing cars in 2025. The battery plant, which Hyundai is building with SK On, will start production in 2026. "We are working on putting ahead that date so we can qualify earlier," Mr. Muñoz said.
Tesla had already told potential buyers that the least expensive version of the Model 3 sedan would qualify for only half the credit, or $ 3,750. This month, Tesla cut the price of that car by $ 1,000 to $ 41,990. After the partial credit is accounted for, the car will effectively cost many buyers a little more than $ 38,000, about as much as a top-of-the-line Honda Accord and cheaper than an entry-level BMW 3 Series sedan.
Other versions of the Model 3 and Model Y S.U.V. will continue to receive the full credit. Tesla sold more electric vehicles in the United States last year than all other carmakers combined, according to Kelley Blue Book.
Some auto executives have said the rules are too restrictive and undermine efforts to limit climate change. Other critics, like Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, have complained that the Biden administration's rules are too lenient.
Administration officials have argued that the regulations strike a balance between promoting electric vehicles and building a domestic supply chain.
By the administration's count, besides the 10 vehicles that qualify for the full credit, seven qualify for half the credit. Vehicles can qualify for half the credit if, for example, their battery components come from the United States, Canada or Mexico but the minerals used to make the batteries do not meet the sourcing requirements.
Ten vehicles that previously qualified, including the Nissan Leaf and the Volkswagen ID.4, will drop off the list, at least temporarily.
The ID.4, an S.U.V. made in Chattanooga, Tenn., did not make the new list because it is still assessing its supply chain. But Pablo Di Si, the chief executive of Volkswagen Group of America, said he expected the model to qualify. Volkswagen was fourth behind Tesla, G.M. and Ford in U.S. electric vehicle sales in the first three months of the year, according to Kelley Blue Book.
Five electric vehicles that G.M. sells or is planning to sell this year will qualify. In addition to the Bolt, the Cadillac Lyriq and electric versions of the Chevrolet Equinox and Blazer S.U.V.s and the Silverado pickup will qualify for the full credit. G.M. and LG Energy Solution have begun producing battery cells at a factory in Ohio.
The new rules could be revised in response to comments from the public. It is up to carmakers to show that they qualify, but they are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service and could be penalized if they provide incorrect information. The I.R.S. publishes a list of eligible vehicles that is updated regularly.
A provision in the law for commercial vehicles allows companies to collect the credits for all leased vehicles even if the cars don't meet sourcing and manufacturing requirements. Automakers and their dealers can pass on the savings to people who lease cars, and, as a result, Hyundai has seen a spike in leases, Mr. Muñoz said. The company is also offering cars through monthly subscriptions to let customers benefit from tax incentives and try electric cars.
But that will not make up for lost sales, because most people prefer buying rather than leasing or renting cars, Mr. Muñoz said.
"We cannot compete unless we simply drop dramatically the price," he said. "It's impossible to make it work from a financial point of view."

If It's Domestic and Electric, China's Car Buyers Want to Own It: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Domestic companies are now selling more vehicles than their multinational rivals, which have failed to keep up with Chinese consumers' demand for electric cars and S.U.V.s.
For years, foreign automakers in China had a bead on customers drawn to luxury brands, like the Cao family in Shanghai. Not anymore.
Ben Cao and his wife, Rachel, both 36, are trading down from two Porsches to one, a gasoline-fueled $ 290,000 Porsche 911 sports car, and buying their first electric vehicle, a $ 70,000 sport utility vehicle designed and manufactured in China by a company called Li Auto.
"If you're sitting in a Li Auto, the first feeling is of luxury," said Mr. Cao, a business consultant.
The rapid rise of Chinese electric carmakers like Li Auto, BYD, Nio and Xpeng Motors is the main preoccupation of the executives, engineers and designers arriving in Shanghai for the start of the city's auto show next Tuesday. The country is now the world's largest car market, and the home teams are routing multinational competitors that had until now mined the riches of China's giant pool of customers. Buyers like the Caos, and China's car companies, have embraced electric vehicles much more rapidly than almost anyone anticipated.
The rise of Chinese auto companies, often subsidized by local governments in cities where they have factories, is another illustration of the country's dominance in electric cars. China now manufactures and sells -- at home and abroad -- most of the world's electric cars. Its prowess extends to the entire value chain for electric cars: It makes almost all of the cars' electric motors and refines most of the chemicals used for lithium batteries. China even leads in developing what could be the next generation of technology, sodium batteries.
More than 80 percent of the electric cars sold in China last year were made by domestic automakers. Last autumn, they overtook multinational companies in the total number of gasoline-powered or electric cars sold each month.
"Multinationals' market share in China will likely continue to decrease due to the continuous development of Chinese automakers, especially in the electric car segment," said Stephen W. Dyer, a managing director in the Shanghai office of Alix Partners, a consulting firm.
As foreign automakers encounter problems in China, they are being pushed to shift more quickly to electric cars in Europe and the United States. The European Union and California want automakers to sell only zero-emission vehicles by 2035. And the Biden administration this week proposed emissions rules that would effectively require about two-thirds of new passenger cars sold in the United States to be electric by 2032 -- standards that some automakers have complained are too stringent.
With a couple of exceptions like Tesla, which China welcomed in 2018 for its technology, Beijing has compelled foreign companies to operate through joint ventures with Chinese automakers. Over the past four decades, multinational companies have trained an entire generation of Chinese auto engineers -- many of whom now work for highly competitive domestic rivals.
Today the number of cars sold by the foreign companies' joint ventures has plummeted as sales of gasoline-powered vehicles have shrunk and E.V.s have soared. Electric cars were almost a quarter of China's market last year, compared with less than 6 percent in the United States, and are expected to be over a third by the end of this year.
Ford Motor sold one million cars and light trucks in China in 2016 and in 2017 but barely 400,000 last year. Hyundai Motor, the South Korean giant, sold 1.8 million cars in China in 2016 and only 385,000 last year.
General Motors, which once vied with Germany's Volkswagen for market leadership, has lost nearly half its sales in China. G.M. would be faring even worse if not for Wuling, a joint venture in which G.M. has a 44 percent stake. Wuling sells ultra-cheap pickup trucks and microvans that cost $ 4,800 to $ 21,800 and have slender profit margins.
The market share of China's domestic car companies rose to 52 percent in the last quarter of 2022, from 47 percent the year before, largely on a huge rise in electric vehicle sales. The best-selling brand is BYD, in which Warren E. Buffett was an early investor. It now holds 10.3 percent of the car market, up from 2.1 percent four years ago and supplanting the Volkswagen brand as China's leader.
Volkswagen has also lost share, although less so than most foreign automakers. It plans to hold the worldwide introduction of its new ID.7 electric sedan in Shanghai on Monday.
A Volkswagen spokesman said the company had already doubled sales of its ID. series of electric cars last year, and was refusing to cut prices like some competitors just to maintain the number of cars sold. G.M. plans to introduce four new electric vehicles this year in China for its Buick, Cadillac and Chevrolet brands, and plans to convert more than half its factory capacity in China to electric cars by 2030.
Volkswagen is so concerned about the China market that it chartered two flights from Germany to Shanghai to bring board members of the Volkswagen Group and its VW, Audi and Porsche brands to the auto show, said a person familiar with the company's plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plans were not public. Volkswagen declined to comment on its auto show travel arrangements.
Electric vehicle sales have grown more slowly this year after national subsidies for purchases expired at the end of December. Sales of gasoline-powered cars have plunged as a purchase tax on them has been restored after a suspension during the pandemic.
Tesla, which sells only electric cars, has had slower growth lately than Chinese electric car manufacturers, prompting the company to cut prices. That has set off a wave of discounting. Many consumers have waited to buy cars while watching whether electric car subsidies or purchase tax reductions will be restored.
"The weakness should be short term, because the weak sales were caused by the price chaos in March," said Cui Dongshu, the secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association.
Multinational companies including Volkswagen and G.M. had introduced electric cars that looked like their gasoline-powered models, with the hope of achieving a gradual transition. But Chinese consumers have gravitated instead toward the flashiest electric car exteriors and interiors available.
Mr. Cao, the Porsche enthusiast, dismisses most designs of multinational automakers as dull.
"They are far behind, no matter whether it is the U.S. ones and even the German ones," he said. "They don't even seem to be in the same age."
Car fashions change quickly in China. Mr. Cao said that he was active in a 350-member club of Chinese buyers of the Sport Turismo version of the Porsche Panamera sedan, and that he knew of at least 50 others who, like him, were buying the Li Auto L9 sport utility vehicle.
Unlike most large S.U.V.s on the global market, the L9 is electric. It has a small gasoline engine as a backup that can recharge the vehicle's hefty battery pack. But the engine does not provide power to move the vehicle itself.
Mr. Cao said he doubted he would need the backup engine. He plans to drive the S.U.V. for day trips to large parks on the outskirts of Shanghai, recharging it at home each night. Such outings have become popular in China with the end of "zero Covid" quarantines and municipal lockdowns. For longer travel to other cities, he said, he would fly or take one of China's many bullet trains.
Even the maneuvering for choice display locations at auto shows like the one in Shanghai has changed. Until the last several years, Chinese automakers vied to put their displays close to multinational brands like Mercedes-Benz, in the expectation that Chinese car buyers would flock to the multinational brands and might see the local brands along the way.
But now, it's Chinese electric car brands that other companies want to surround on the showroom floor, said Bill Russo, a former chief executive of Chrysler China. "You want to be closer to them -- the Chinese companies have the hottest battery electric vehicles," he said. "Foreign automakers don't have the same halo now."

Challenges Could Stall Biden's E.V. Revolution: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The administration's push to supercharge E.V. sales must now surmount resistance from manufacturers and consumers as well as likely legal challenges.
WASHINGTON -- Aggressive rules proposed by the Biden administration to drastically speed up the country's transition to electric vehicles, and significantly cut the auto pollution that is dangerously heating the planet, face several economic, logistical and legal challenges.
The plans, outlined Wednesday by the Environmental Protection Agency, are designed to ensure that two-thirds of new passenger cars and a quarter of new heavy trucks sold in the United States are all-electric by 2032. If enacted as proposed, the regulations would mean a quantum leap for the auto industry in the United States, where just 5.8 percent of new cars and less than 2 percent of trucks sold last year were all-electric.
Transportation is the single largest source of greenhouse gases generated by the United States, the second-biggest polluting country after China. To head off climate catastrophe, President Biden has promised to cut the nation's emissions in half by 2030. Shrinking tailpipe emissions is key to that plan.
But to transform the American automobile industry on the scale it envisions, the Biden administration has to surmount resistance from manufacturers and consumers as well as likely legal challenges from those who consider the regulations government overreach.
One of the most important aspects of a wholesale transition to electric vehicles has to do with timing.
Although nearly every automaker has already invested billions in electrification, the proposed regulations create a dilemma: how to continue to manufacture gasoline-powered vehicles, which provide profits, while investing even more in new electric facilities. The aggressive timeline envisioned by the government means the carmakers could also struggle to source the materials required for vehicle batteries, already difficult to obtain.
Market demand is another challenge. Even with federal tax incentives of up to $ 7,500 for consumers, electric vehicles cost more upfront than conventional cars and trucks. At the end of 2022, the price of an average new car was $ 49,507 compared with $ 61,448 for an electric vehicle, according to the Kelley Blue Book. But even for motivated consumers who can afford electric vehicles, a major stumbling block is what's known as range anxiety, the fear of being stranded because an electric vehicle cannot reach its destination on a single charge and not enough fast-charging stations exit.
"This was always a transformation that was going to happen over decades," said Stephanie Brinley, an automotive analyst at S&P Global. "Putting this aggressive a timeline on it means that there are a lot of things that have to happen consecutively and concurrently."
Looming over all of this is an all-but-certain legal and political threat: The new rules could be erased by the courts or a future president.
In many ways, the industry is already moving into an all-electric future. General Motors has set a goal of phasing out the sale of all internal combustion vehicles by 2035. Ford Motor has said it hopes E.V.s make up half of its sales by 2030. Volkswagen and Stellantis, the company formed through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, have similar targets. Hyundai and Nissan are also ramping up E.V. production.
But the proposed regulations would require even more of automakers.
Ford is on track to spend $ 50 billion between 2022 through 2026 on its electric vehicle production, with two battery factories under construction in Kentucky, and a third planned in Tennessee, along with an electric truck plant. In February it announced it would build a $ 3.5 billion battery plant in Michigan with a Chinese partner.
The automaker, however, will most likely need to spend billions more if electric vehicles are to make up two-thirds of the more than two million vehicles that it sells in North America annually.
The risks of accelerating the transition away from gasoline-powered vehicles are "high, if not very high," for the industry, said Matthias Heck, a vice president at Moody's Investors Service, "because electrification will require further substantial investments into new battery electric vehicles, battery technology, supply chain and manufacturing capacity, and charging infrastructure."
Ford and other automakers also have not yet secured sufficient sources of lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese and other materials needed for automotive batteries, and it is unclear where they will get them.
While the Biden administration is betting that electric vehicle costs will come down with mass production, Carlos Tavares, chief executive of Stellantis, said the difficulty of sourcing materials worked against that. "The affordability is not there because the raw materials are scarce and very expensive, and, I would add, very volatile," Mr. Tavares said at a recent conference in Detroit.
Manufacturers are funding their electric vehicle production now from substantial profits on their gas-powered trucks and sport utility vehicles. But maintaining profitability as they produce more electric vehicles and fewer gas-powered models will be a challenge, experts say.
General Motors has said it is not yet making money on its electric vehicles, and Ford recently said its electric division was set to lose $ 3 billion this year. Both companies hope to turn the corner as they ramp up production of electric models but are also trying to cut costs now, especially in view of the uncertain economy.
G.M. is in the process of eliminating 5,000 jobs as part of an effort to reduce costs by $ 2 billion. Ford last year began to trim about 3,000 jobs from its work force.
"Getting to 50, 60 percent E.V.s is certainly possible," said Sam Abuelsamid, a principal research analyst at Guidehouse Insights. "But this isn't going to be easy. Not at all."
And while the pace of electric vehicle purchases is ticking up, many car buyers are uncertain about the new technology.
"We're making sales to early adopters and easy adopters but we need to get beyond them," said John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents large U.S. and foreign automakers. "We have a long way to go."
The most basic hurdle is price.
The federal government will offer buyers up to $ 7,500 in tax credits for the purchase of an electric vehicle for the next decade, depending on how much of the vehicle was made in the United States. But of the 91 unique electric vehicle models now on the market in the country, fewer than 40 qualify for the tax credits, Mr. Bozzella said.
Drivers are also worried about charging electric vehicles. There are currently 130,000 public electric vehicle charging stations in the United States, according to the White House. Under the 2021 infrastructure law, the government will spend $ 7.5 billion to build half a million electric vehicle charging stations along federal highways. But a January report from S&P Global concluded that the nation would need more than 2 million public charging stations by 2030, in addition to private home and garage chargers.
Doug Freeman, an insurance executive in Amesbury, Mass., is an obvious customer for an electric vehicle. He has a 140-mile round trip commute to work, and currently drives a Chevrolet Volt hybrid. "For me, the green side isn't number one on the priority list, but the savings on fuel from an electric vehicle would be a lot more than for the average consumer," he said.
But the model he covets, the Kia EV6, is not made in the United States and doesn't qualify for the $ 7,500 tax credit. "Without the credit, it's $ 50,000 to $ 54,000," Mr. Freeman said. "I've never paid more than about $ 33,000 for a car."
Electric vehicle makers are making use of one way to win over consumers: rentals. In 2021, Hertz, the car rental company, bought 100,000 Teslas, making E.V.s 20 percent of its fleet. Most other major car rental companies are also adding electric vehicles to their fleets.
"Rental cars are an excellent way to move E.V.s from niche to mainstream," said Drew Kodjak, executive director of the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research organization. "It offers consumers a way to test-drive electric vehicles for a few days, see if they like them, see how they feel about range anxiety," he said.
By purchasing American-made electric vehicles such as Teslas, the rental companies receive $ 7,500 in tax credits per car. And the Biden administration has made it easier for the rental companies to resell the cars after a few years: buyers can receive up to $ 4,000 in tax credits for the used electric cars.
"Through the incentives and the new laws, the administration has put in place a lot of policies to help automakers get where this regulation says they need to go," Ms. Brinley of S&P Global said.
Even if companies can churn out affordable electric vehicles at a fast pace, and consumers get over range anxiety, the proposed regulations are certain to be hit with legal challenges or be subject to shifting politics.
Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and gas industry, called the regulations "a major step toward a ban on the vehicles Americans rely on."
"As proposed, this rule will hurt consumers with higher costs and greater reliance on unstable foreign supply chains," Mr. Sommers said.
Former President Donald J. Trump relished rolling back the auto pollution regulations enacted by his predecessor, Barack Obama. A future president could do the same to the Biden regulations.
A group of Republican attorneys general, many of them from oil-producing states, has already challenged several of the Biden administration's climate polices, none of which are as ambitious as the proposed auto pollution regulations.
Attorney General Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia suggested on Wednesday that the group would fight the newest proposals.
Steven G. Bradbury, who served as the chief legal counsel for the Transportation Department during the Trump administration, said the regulations would amount to government overreach.
"They are using this established, longstanding statute for an entirely new purpose, to force an entirely new goal: the transformation of the industry to electric vehicles," said Mr. Bradbury, a former clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas. "This is clearly driven by the president's directive to achieve these results. I don't think you can do this. Congress never contemplated the uses of statutes in this way."
Jody Freeman, a professor of environmental law at Harvard University, who also served as a climate adviser to President Barack Obama, argued that the Clean Air Act has been used successfully for years to compel polluting industries to invest in new technologies to reduce emissions.
"All of that is part of the normal course of how E.P.A. has set standards," she said.
But she conceded that it may not be seen that way by the current Supreme Court, consisting of six judges appointed by Republican presidents, including three named to the court by Mr. Trump.
"It is a court that is very unsympathetic to regulation of any kind, and particularly hostile to the E.P.A.," Ms. Freeman said.

WASHINGTON — Aggressive rules proposed by the Biden administration to drastically speed up the country’s transition to electric vehicles, and significantly cut the auto pollution that is dangerously heating the planet, face several economic, logistical and legal challenges.
The plans, outlined Wednesday by the Environmental Protection Agency, are designed to ensure that two-thirds of new passenger cars and one-quarter of new heavy trucks sold in the United States are all-electric by 2032. If enacted as proposed, the regulations would mean a quantum leap for the auto industry in the United States, where just 5.8% of new cars and less than 2% of trucks sold last year were all-electric.
Transportation is the single largest source of greenhouse gases generated by the United States, the second-biggest polluting country after China. To head off climate catastrophe, President Joe Biden has promised to cut the nation’s emissions in half by 2030. Shrinking tailpipe emissions is key to that plan.
But to transform the American automobile industry on the scale it envisions, the Biden administration has to surmount resistance from manufacturers and consumers as well as likely legal challenges from those who consider the regulations government overreach.
One of the most important aspects of a wholesale transition to electric vehicles has to do with timing.
Although nearly every automaker has already invested billions in electrification, the proposed regulations create a dilemma: how to continue to manufacture gasoline-powered vehicles, which provide profits, while investing even more in new electric facilities. The aggressive timeline envisioned by the government means that carmakers could also struggle to source the materials required for vehicle batteries, already difficult to obtain.
Market demand is another challenge. Even with federal tax incentives of up to $7,500 for consumers, electric vehicles cost more upfront than conventional cars and trucks. At the end of 2022, the price of an average new car was $49,507 compared with $61,448 for an electric vehicle, according to the Kelley Blue Book. But even for motivated consumers who can afford electric vehicles, a major stumbling block is what’s known as range anxiety, the fear of being stranded because an electric vehicle cannot reach its destination on a single charge and not enough fast-charging stations exist.
“This was always a transformation that was going to happen over decades,” said Stephanie Brinley, an automotive analyst at S&P Global. “Putting this aggressive a timeline on it means that there are a lot of things that have to happen consecutively and concurrently.”
Looming over all of this is an all-but-certain legal and political threat: The new rules could be erased by the courts or a future president.
In many ways, the industry is already moving into an all-electric future. General Motors has set a goal of phasing out the sale of all internal combustion vehicles by 2035. Ford Motor has said it hopes EVs make up half of its sales by 2030. Volkswagen and Stellantis, the company formed through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, have similar targets.

One Man's Commute, Seen From the Back Seat: [Review]

Full text: This experimental film pulls together excerpts from 11 evening commutes, as a man drives from the suburbs of Melbourne, Australia, toward the city's center.
The majority of "The Plains" is shot from a fixed position inside a car, roughly from the vantage point of a passenger in the middle of the back seat. As the movie opens, the car is parked at an office complex on a rainy day. A driver hops in. Over the next three hours, viewers will learn the intricacies of his evening commute -- the often-heavy traffic as he drives north on Blackburn Road or the slowdowns he might encounter when he makes a left to enter the freeway.
The highway will take him northwest from the suburbs toward central Melbourne, Australia, although the movie never shows him reaching his destination. "The Plains" excerpts 11 commutes, not always from the route's beginning. The drive always takes place around 5 p.m., judging from the car's clock, and the sun's height indicates the season. The driver, Andrew, periodically listens to the radio or makes phone calls. Because he wears earbuds, we can't hear much from the person on the other end.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
There are occasional variations, as when, a little more than halfway through, Andrew stops to get gas. Some days he gives a lift to David, his colleague at a legal center. During one such ride, we learn from the men's dialogue that we've changed cars -- Andrew has replaced his previous Hyundai with a new one. (From the back seat, it's hard to tell.)
That David is, in fact, the film's director, David Easteal, hints that "The Plains" isn't a straight documentary. Easteal wrote a loose script based on his own rides with Andrew Rakowski, who also plays a version of himself. Their long conversations concern relationships, aging and death. Fans of structural film, "Jeanne Dielman" and Google Maps will find much to treasure, even if the narrative elements -- and occasional cutaways to imagery shot in a more remote area in western Victoria -- upset the movie's rigor and purposeful tedium.

Miami Beach Wants to Tame Spring Break for Good: [National Desk]

Full text: After a series of violent incidents, the city is moving to pre-empt late-night partying, but businesses worry about crimping their most profitable tourism season.
MIAMI BEACH -- After two fatal shootings on Ocean Drive over a March weekend, Miami Beach leaders followed their recent playbook for dealing with raucous spring break crowds: a state of emergency, a midnight curfew and limited liquor sales.
Then, in a new and drastic step, the city commissioners announced a curfew for 2024, a full year in advance, and declared spring break on the sun-kissed streets of Miami Beach to be over.
"Miami Beach is shutting the door on spring break, once and for all," Alex J. Fernandez, a city commissioner who sponsored a series of 2024 measures, said before the vote.
The decision, in the middle of the March and April season that is the most profitable time of the year for local businesses, has caused both relief and consternation over the possible loss of the throngs of visitors that have grown to overwhelm the city's police and other public services -- and of the money that those visitors spend on hotel rooms, nightclub cover charges and boozy cocktails.
Miami Beach both loves and hates its tourists, a conflicting sentiment that has long plagued officials as the city has evolved from a cocaine-cowboy den in the 1980s, to a high-fashion Riviera in the 1990s, to what it is today: a glittering playground for affluent families making a home, foreigners chasing the sun and young American visitors who come looking for a good time. Some people, including the city's mayor, want the partyers gone for good.
If Miami Beach is to be rebranded as less of a spring-break destination and more of an arts, culture and health and wellness hub, some owners of bars, nightclubs and liquor stores worry that they will lose business. And some residents and officials fear losing the diversity and laid-back vibe that make Miami Beach Miami Beach.
"What we're seeing is panic-stricken politicians who feel the need to do something," Ricky Arriola, a city commissioner who voted against the 2024 curfew, said in an interview. "The heavy hand of government is being imposed on residents, our visitors and businesses, rather than doing the hard work of coming up with really strategic alternatives."
Similar frictions between residents and visitors have afflicted other popular Florida spring break locales like Panama City Beach. Over time, Fort Lauderdale and other cities have pushed spring breakers out, in part by raising hotel rates and changing zoning laws to turn dive bars into more upscale establishments.
Miami Beach has been wrestling with its reputation as a party town. A judge recently upheld an ordinance imposing a partial 2 a.m. cutoff on alcohol sales for a South Beach neighborhood known as South of Fifth, now full of glimmering condos. The law had been challenged by Story, a nightclub that argued it could not survive if it could no longer sell alcohol until 5 a.m.
Patience has worn thin as spring-break revelers, often partying with alcohol or drugs, have packed a roughly 10-block stretch of South Beach along the Atlantic oceanfront each season, leading to unpredictable situations that sometimes turn violent because so many people have guns, according to city leaders, police officers and business owners.
The two deadly incidents this year took place over the St. Patrick's Day weekend, typically one of the busiest of the season. After the second, the city briefly imposed a midnight curfew.
Last year, two shootings on Ocean Drive led the city to set a midnight curfew. In 2021, Miami Beach made headlines when, while still in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, the city marketed itself to visitors even though many nightclubs remained closed, leading to raucous street parties. Officials responded that year by imposing an 8 p.m. curfew.
The rowdy behavior in the streets and the curfews that result have hurt businesses year after year, said Joshua Wallack, the chief operating officer of Mango's Tropical Cafe, an Ocean Drive institution for more than 30 years.
"When they go from a dangerous situation to complete lockdown, there is no business," he said. "We're just caught in the wake of how they handle it. The service industry and the hospitality industry, they get completely obliterated because it goes from having complete chaos to nothing."
In the past, civil rights activists have complained about the city police department's use of military-style vehicles, pepper balls and forceful crowd control tactics during spring break, which attracts many Black visitors to a city whose resident population is largely white. Glendon Hall, chairman of the Miami Beach Black Affairs Advisory Committee, which was created two years ago, was embedded with police officers and the city's "goodwill ambassadors" during spring break last month. He said in a statement that was read at a meeting on Tuesday that he was pleased with how law enforcement handled the "massive crowds" this year, and that there had been no major complaints from civil rights groups.
The Miami Beach Police Department made 573 arrests in March, a slight drop from 615 arrests in March 2022, according to Officer Ernesto Rodriguez, a department spokesman. Police officers seized more than 100 guns this year, he added.
In spite of the headlines about shootings and curfews, families, couples and small gaggles of friends strolled down the sidewalks of Ocean Drive on a Friday afternoon late last month. Marcus Benjamin, a 19-year-old college student from Chicago, said the city's emergency measures had "not at all" affected his trip with two of his buddies.
"I've seen a lot of cops on the beach," said one of his friends, Cameron Sasser, also 19. "But it's about the same as other years."
Still, most everyone in city leadership seems to agree that the chaotic spring-break crowds have become too much. But when it comes to what to do about them, views differ.
Mayor Dan Gelber said spring break "doesn't fit with a city that has so many residents."
"South Beach has bars and restaurants," he said, "but it also has elementary schools and churches and synagogues." Some local residents and visitors who spend lavishly often avoid the city during spring break.
Some commissioners like Mr. Fernandez have said they want to keep spring breakers, but not "lawbreakers" who follow them into the city.
"The worst thing that we can do is continue doing the same thing we've done now for several years in a row, which is knowing that we're going to have an overcrowding of our city and waiting until the violent situation occurs -- until the death occurs -- to react," he said in an interview. "It's better to get ahead of the situation and impose the curfew and the restrictions now."
In 2021, Miami Beach lost in court after the Clevelander Hotel sued the city over a law setting a 2 a.m. cutoff for alcohol sales. The judge ruled that the ordinance had not been properly enacted.
Under states of emergency during past spring breaks, increased regulations yielded little success in subduing the party scene, according to commissioners like Mr. Arriola, who would prefer to bring in a big organized event in March that would allow officials to set up barricades, ticketed entry and metal detectors around Ocean Drive roughly from Fifth to 15th Streets.
"At least people that are celebrating spring break in a street party on Ocean Drive could have the comfort of knowing that there wouldn't be any weapons in that area," he said.
After seeing crowds grow for nearly two decades at another busy time of year, Memorial Day weekend, the city began in 2017 to host the Hyundai Air & Sea Show, which features the military. The event has displaced many of the partyers who used to gather for Urban Beach Week, celebrating hip-hop.
This year, a three-day festival in March on Ocean Drive and in nearby Lummus Park drew daytime visitors and, the police department said, helped tame spring break -- but only until the festival's music and other entertainment ended at around 9 p.m. each day. Both of the shootings happened later at night.
Without a major event lined up for 2024, the city appears to be considering a spring break lockdown -- something Mr. Wallack said would go too far. Miami Beach should be able to offer a multitude of activities, from arts to wellness to nightlife, without having to sacrifice one for another, he argued.
"This is a city," he said.
And anyway, he added, "Good luck trying to lock down public beaches."

MIAMI BEACH — After two fatal shootings on Ocean Drive over a March weekend, Miami Beach leaders followed their recent playbook for dealing with raucous spring break crowds: a state of emergency, a midnight curfew and limited liquor sales.
Then, in a new and drastic step, the city commissioners announced a curfew for 2024, a full year in advance, and declared spring break on the sun-kissed streets of Miami Beach to be over.
“Miami Beach is shutting the door on spring break, once and for all,” Alex Fernandez, a city commissioner who sponsored a series of 2024 measures, said before the vote.
The decision, in the middle of the March and April season that is the most profitable time of the year for local businesses, has caused both relief and consternation over the possible loss of the throngs of visitors that have grown to overwhelm the city’s police and other public services — and of the money that those visitors spend on hotel rooms, nightclub cover charges and boozy cocktails.
Miami Beach both loves and hates its tourists, a conflicting sentiment that has long plagued officials as the city has evolved from a cocaine cowboy den in the 1980s to a high-fashion Riviera in the 1990s to what it is today: a glittering playground for affluent families making a home, foreigners chasing the sun and young American visitors who come looking for a good time. Some people, including the city’s mayor, want the partyers gone for good.
If Miami Beach is to be rebranded as less of a spring break destination and more of an arts, culture and health and wellness hub, some owners of bars, nightclubs and liquor stores worry that they will lose business. And some residents and officials fear losing the diversity and laid-back vibe that make Miami Beach Miami Beach.
“What we’re seeing is panic-stricken politicians who feel the need to do something,” Ricky Arriola, a city commissioner who voted against the 2024 curfew, said in an interview. “The heavy hand of government is being imposed on residents, our visitors and businesses, rather than doing the hard work of coming up with really strategic alternatives.”
Similar frictions between residents and visitors have afflicted other popular Florida spring break locales like Panama City Beach. Over time, Fort Lauderdale and other cities have pushed spring breakers out, in part by raising hotel rates and changing zoning laws to turn dive bars into more upscale establishments.
Miami Beach has been wrestling with its reputation as a party town. A judge recently upheld an ordinance imposing a partial 2 a.m. cutoff on alcohol sales for a South Beach neighborhood known as South of Fifth, now full of glimmering condos. The law had been challenged by Story, a nightclub that argued it could not survive if it could no longer sell alcohol until 5 a.m.
Patience has worn thin as spring break revelers, often partying with alcohol or drugs, have packed a roughly 10-block stretch of South Beach along the Atlantic oceanfront each season, leading to unpredictable situations that sometimes turn violent because so many people have guns, according to city leaders, police officers and business owners.
The two deadly incidents this year took place over the St. Patrick’s Day weekend, typically one of the busiest of the season. After the second, the city briefly imposed a midnight curfew.
Last year, two shootings on Ocean Drive led the city to set a midnight curfew. In 2021, Miami Beach made headlines when, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, the city marketed itself to visitors even though many nightclubs remained closed, leading to raucous street parties. Officials responded that year by imposing an 8 p.m. curfew.
The rowdy behavior in the streets and the curfews that result have hurt businesses year after year, said Joshua Wallack, the chief operating officer of Mango’s Tropical Cafe, an Ocean Drive institution for more than 30 years.
“When they go from a dangerous situation to complete lockdown, there is no business,” he said. “We’re just caught in the wake of how they handle it. The service industry and the hospitality industry, they get completely obliterated because it goes from having complete chaos to nothing.”

General Motors Reports Raise in Quarterly Sales, Citing a Robust Demand: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: General Motors and several rivals cited robust demand in the first quarter. But affordability is a growing challenge for many buyers.
Automakers have mostly overcome the supply-chain challenges that upended production early in the pandemic. Now they are trying to weather a new challenge: higher borrowing costs for their customers.
General Motors and several other automakers reported on Monday that new-vehicle sales increased substantially in the first three months of the year, thanks to improved supplies of key components and firm demand from both consumers and commercial customers.
But the steady interest rate increases in the last 12 months have raised questions about whether the industry can maintain its sales momentum throughout 2023.
Jonathan Smoke, the chief economist at the market research firm Cox Automotive, said higher rates were already starting to put new vehicles out of the reach of buyers with lower incomes or weaker credit scores.
According to Cox, "subprime" borrowers -- those with weaker credit profiles -- make up just under 6 percent of all new-car purchases, down from 18 percent five years ago. Car buyers paid an average interest rate of 8.95 percent last month, up from 5.66 percent in March 2022.
The average monthly payment on new vehicles was $ 784 in February, compared with $ 681 a year earlier, Cox calculated.
"Affordability challenges are limiting access to the vehicle market," Mr. Smoke said. "Higher interest rates are having a huge impact."
Sticker prices have also challenged buyers. Auto prices -- for new and used vehicles alike -- have been a prominent driver of inflation over the last two years, although there are signs they are cooling off. The average price for a new car or light truck in February was $ 48,763, according to Cox -- up from $ 46,297 a year earlier, but down from $ 49,468 in January.
Mr. Smoke said automakers got off to a strong start in January and February, but saw credit tighten somewhat in March after the banking industry was shaken by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.
G.M. said its new-vehicle sales in the United States rose 18 percent in the first three months of the year, to 603,208 cars and trucks. Sales to consumers rose 15 percent and sales to rental, corporate and government fleet customers increased 27 percent.
In the last several months, G.M. has been able to keep its factories humming as a result of steadier supplies of computer chips and other critical parts. The company ended the quarter with 412,285 vehicles in dealer stocks, up slightly from what it had at the end of 2022, but nearly 140,000 more than it had a year earlier.
Honda Motor reported that its U.S. sales increased 7 percent to 284,507 cars and trucks, while Nissan saw a gain of 17 percent, to 235,818. Hyundai said its U.S. sales rose 16 percent to 184,449.
Toyota Motor, however, has continued to suffered from parts shortages that have left its dealers with slim inventories. Its first-quarter sales fell 9 percent to 469,558 cars and trucks. Stellantis, formed through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot SA, also reported a decline. Its sales fell 9 percent to 368,327 cars and trucks.
Ford Motor is scheduled to report its latest sales figures on Tuesday.
G.M. has forecast a rapid increase this year in sales of electric vehicles; so far, it is off to an uneven start. The company sold 19,700 Chevrolet Bolt compacts in the first quarter, more than three times the total a year earlier, but other models have yet to make a splash.
Sales of the Cadillac Lyriq, an electric sport-utility vehicle, totaled just 968, and G.M. sold only two GMC Hummer E.V.s, down from 99 in the first quarter of 2022.
G.M. started production last summer at a new plant in Ohio that is supposed to provide battery packs for the Hummer E.V., the Lyriq and several other vehicles scheduled to arrive in showrooms this year. They include electric versions of the Chevrolet Silverado pickup and the Chevy Equinox and Blazer S.U.V.s.

Fewer E.V.s Will Qualify For Credits: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The Biden administration hopes its guidelines for up to $ 7,500 in tax credits will encourage automakers to reduce their reliance on China for batteries and raw materials.
The Biden administration on Friday released new rules that will significantly shorten the list of electric vehicles that qualify for federal tax credits. Officials hope the change will push carmakers to move their supply chains out of China and to the United States or its allies.
The rules, issued by the Treasury Department, are a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, which Democrats passed last year to fight climate change by encouraging the use of zero-emission vehicles and green energy. The law also seeks to reduce the industry's reliance on China, which makes most of the world's batteries and dominates the processing of critical raw materials.
For purchases of their electric cars to qualify for up to $ 7,500 in tax credits, automakers must meet strict requirements for where they assemble the cars and batteries and where they get the materials that go into batteries. Only a handful of vehicles are expected to qualify for the full credit when the rules, which are more stringent than previous requirements, go into effect April 18, down from 21 now.
The new rules, which could be revised in response to comments from the public, will require that a certain percentage of the components and minerals in each electric car's battery come from domestic sources or countries with which the United States has trade agreements.
The full list of qualifying cars will not be published for a couple of weeks, but Tesla has begun informing buyers that the changes would affect its lineup. The company said on its website that the least expensive version of its Model 3 sedan, one of the most popular electric cars, would no longer be eligible for the full credit. The car uses a battery made in China.
General Motors said Friday that three electric vehicles it plans to sell this year -- the Cadillac Lyriq and electric versions of the Chevrolet Equinox and Blazer sport utility vehicles -- would qualify for the full credit.
James M. Wickett, a partner at Hogan Lovells who focuses on tax and energy policy, said the electric vehicle tax credit was "moving supply chains, to the tune of tens of billions."
"The details matter in a significant way," he added.
One significant detail on Friday expanded the program to include battery minerals from Japan and paved the way for adding more countries, such as the 27 members of the European Union.
Officials in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have also begun discussing plans to build a kind of buyers' club for critical minerals that could exert pressure over the global industry, including setting higher labor and environmental standards for mining, processing and manufacturing.
The race is on for manufacturers whose vehicles don't qualify for the U.S. tax credits to procure the minerals and components that will satisfy the requirements. The credit awards a significant competitive advantage to any car that makes the grade.
To be eligible, at least 50 percent of the components in an electric car battery must be made in North America. And 40 percent of the minerals used to make the batteries, which often contain nickel, manganese and cobalt, must come from domestic sources or from countries that have trade agreements with the United States. The minerals quota will rise every year until it reaches 80 percent by 2027, and the component quota will climb to 100 percent in 2029.
The administration said it would later issue rules clarifying how much investment that companies could receive from countries like China and Russia and still qualify for tax credits. The law includes prohibitions on using critical minerals and battery components from a "foreign entity of concern," a term that includes companies based in China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.
Siyu Huang, the chief executive of Factorial Energy, a Massachusetts company that is developing advanced batteries with backing from Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai and Stellantis, welcomed the trade agreement with Japan. But she said it would be "very challenging" to acquire battery-grade lithium because almost all the refineries are in China.
"The critical part of this is really about where the lithium is coming from," Ms. Huang said.
In writing the rules, Biden officials have tried to balance two priorities: Encouraging Americans to buy cleaner cars to mitigate climate change, and trying to bring more factories for cars, batteries and battery materials to the United States and its allies.
Company executives, and some analysts, said the administration had come down on the side of the latter goal. Given the limited number of vehicles that currently qualify for tax credits, some consumers could decide to wait to buy an electric car until more become eligible in a few years, said William Reinsch, the Scholl Chair in International Business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
"What always happens if people are uncertain is they hold on to their wallets," Mr. Reinsch said.
Jennifer Safavian, the chief executive of Autos Drive America, which represents foreign carmakers like Toyota, Honda and Volkswagen, welcomed Japan's inclusion and said it would help strengthen supply chains. Yet, she added, the drop in the number of eligible cars would slow the growth of electric cars.
But some lawmakers complain the Biden administration has been too generous to foreign companies. Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a pivotal player in the Inflation Reduction Act's writing and passage, said this week that he may bring a court case challenging the administration's interpretation of the law.
In a statement Friday, Mr. Manchin said that the Treasury Department's guidance "completely ignores the intent" of the act.
"It is horrific that the administration continues to ignore the purpose of the law, which is to bring manufacturing back to America and ensure we have reliable and secure supply chains," he said. "American tax dollars should not be used to support manufacturing jobs overseas."
The legislation has already shaken up the car industry. Immediately after President Biden signed the bill in August, a provision excluded from the tax credits any electric vehicles not made in the United States, Mexico or Canada.
Hyundai and Kia cars made in South Korea no longer qualified, angering that nation's leaders, who felt betrayed by a close military and trade partner. Sales of South Korean-made electric vehicles have since lost market share in the United States.
The law also proved to be a major source of friction diplomatically. Leaders of the European Union, Japan and other U.S. allies feared the program would lure investment away from their countries or force them to offer more generous subsidies to compete with the United States.
Because the European Union, Japan and Britain do not have free-trade agreements with the United States, products from those countries, including battery materials, did not qualify for any portion of the tax credits.
Under pressure from foreign governments, the Biden administration proposed a workaround. In a news release, the Treasury Department said the law did not define the term "free trade agreement," which "could include newly negotiated critical minerals agreements." The Biden administration signed a limited trade deal with Japan on Tuesday covering critical minerals, and is negotiating a similar deal with the European Union.
But the strategy has been strongly criticized by lawmakers in Congress, who have said the administration failed to consult with them on trade policy, or argue that U.S. taxpayer money will now subsidize Japanese industry.
For consumers, the new rules are likely to make many electric vehicles more expensive.
At least some Tesla vehicles are likely to remain eligible. The company makes cars in California and Texas and batteries in Nevada. Ford Motor said it would "soon" disclose whether any of its vehicles qualify.
Carmakers will have to certify whether their vehicles meet the components and minerals requirements. The Internal Revenue Service will enforce the rules. Some vehicles may qualify for only half the credit if, for example, they meet the component quotas but not the minerals quotas.
The list of eligible cars is expected to grow as it becomes easier for companies to buy processed lithium and other materials from U.S. trade partners like Canada and Australia. Numerous companies are developing mines and building refineries. More cars will also qualify once Hyundai, Ford, Honda and other automakers finish building new car and battery plants in the United States.
And a loophole in the law allows companies to collect the credits if they lease vehicles to customers, even if the cars don't meet sourcing and manufacturing requirements. Automakers and their dealers could pass on those credits to consumers by reducing monthly lease payments.

Full text: In a fashion world surprise, the designer is leaving the Italian label he has helmed for 10 years.
Fashion is about to get a little less funny. In yet another major industry surprise, Jeremy Scott is leaving his post as the creative director of Moschino, the brand's parent company said in a statement on Monday. His departure ends a 10-year tenure that rejuvenated the brand by using it as a vehicle to poke fun at consumerism while simultaneously celebrating it in visual stunts tailor-made for the Instagram era. No successor has been named.
After the designer Alessandro Michele left Gucci in November, the move will further reshape the Italian fashion world, where Mr. Scott's ability to inject a kind of ironic postmodern pop humor into clothes catapulted Moschino to new relevance.
The brand became a favorite of celebrities such as Miley Cyrus, who once wore a Moschino T-shirt dress splashed with the words "I had nothing to wear so I put on this Moschino dress," and Katy Perry, who wore a Moschino chandelier and a Moschino hamburger to the Met Gala in 2019.
Massimo Ferretti, the chairman of Aeffe, the group that owns Moschino, in a statement thanked Mr. Scott for "ushering in a distinct and joyful vision that will forever be a part of Moschino history."
Mr. Scott, 47, who grew up in Kansas City, Mo., and studied at the Pratt Institute in New York, was only the third designer to lead the house, which was founded by Franco Moschino in 1983 to celebrate the virtues of elegant irreverence. After Mr. Moschino's death in 1994 from complications of AIDS, Rosella Jardini took over, gamely carrying on the legacy until Mr. Scott arrived in 2013 with his own sense of subversive humor.
Almost immediately, his way with a fashion pun resonated with a generation reared on social media (so much so that in 2015, Mr. Scott was tapped to redesign the "Moonman" statuette given to winners at MTV's Video Music Awards). Mr. Scott sent riffs on McDonald's and Barbie down the runway, made Le Smokings that were literally smoking in a nod to the Bonfire of the Vanities, and last September created an entire ode to inflatables because -- well, you know, inflation (and who can't use a life raft now and again?).
When Covid-19 put live fashion shows on hold, Mr. Scott presented a collection worn by marionettes crafted in Jim Henson's studio. He populated the show's pseudo front row with puppet versions of fashion editors like Anna Wintour and Edward Enninful, inviting watchers to ponder the question of who in fashion really pulls the strings.
A dress Mr. Scott designed for a Moschino collection inspired by game-show kitsch, which featured an entire TV dinner on its train, played a starring role in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's 2019 exhibition "Camp: Notes on Fashion." (That dress was one of about 15 Moschino outfits in the show.) Alongside the runway stunts, Mr. Scott was canny enough to offer special collections with T-shirts and phone cases, allowing everyone access to his Moschino world.
Sometimes the jokes could fall flat, but overall the result was a boom in sales, at least until last year. In 2022, Aeffe -- which also owns the brands Alberta Ferretti, Philosophy di Lorenzo Serafini and Pollini -- reported a loss of nine million euros (about $ 10 million) on revenues of 352 million euros (about $ 377 million), thanks in part to complications in China.
"He took chances, but always with a sense of fun," said Robert Burke, the founder of a namesake luxury consultancy, of Mr. Scott. "He was a great match for Moschino."
Though Mr. Scott had maintained his own eponymous brand throughout most of his time at Moschino, in recent seasons it has been put on hold. Whether it will now be revived, or whether, as he once suggested, he will move into movies, Mr. Scott did not reveal. In a text message from Seoul, where he is introducing a new collaboration with Hyundai, he simply said, "Every book has chapters and as I end this chapter, I am excited to share with the world my next chapter."
It is unclear whether Mr. Scott's tenure at Moschino ended because of a shift in the general mood in the industry, which is turning away from buzz-making theatrics and toward "timelessness" as sales of classic luxury brands including Chanel and Hermès soar, or whether, as some conventional wisdom has it, a decade is simply long enough for a single creative director to helm a fashion house. Both Mr. Scott and the Aeffe group declined to elaborate on the statement announcing his departure.
The fashion game of designer musical chairs continues.

Michigan to Be First State in Decades to End Measure That Hurt Unions: [Correction]

Full text: A state is rolling back a so-called right-to-work law for the first time in decades, as depleted unions must now relearn how to bolster their ranks.
For more than a decade, Western Michigan's food and commercial workers union has been in a defensive crouch after Republicans made union membership optional in a state once synonymous with organized labor. The union shifted from expansion and organizing to just trying to hold down attrition as workers opted out of paying their dues.
On Tuesday, the newly elected Democratic-led State Legislature gave final approval to a bill repealing a so-called right-to-work law. It was the latest in a raft of legislation out of Washington and Democratic state capitals meant to reverse the decline of organized labor and bolster Democratic political strength in elections to come.
But John Cakmakci, president of the United Food & Commercial Workers Union Local 951 in Grand Rapids, warned that a rebound would take time as the state's labor apparatus relearns how to organize workers and expand. That means the payoff to Democrats could be muted for now.
"Do I think we can rebound? Absolutely," said Mr. Cakmakci (pronounced Cack-mack-ee). "Are we ready now? No."
Since 1947, when a conservative Congress passed legislation allowing states to adopt right-to-work legislation, 27 states and the territory of Guam have passed laws or constitutional amendments that give workers the right to opt out of their union dues, even if wages, benefits and work rules at their place of employment are set by a union contract.
The ensuing "free rider" problem -- workers' getting the benefit of representation without paying dues -- helped lead to a sharp decline in organized labor, as unions in right-to-work states tried, often in vain, to keep existing members signed up instead of organizing new workplaces. Nationally, union membership last year dropped to 10.1 percent of all workers, half of what the rate was in 1983.
When Michigan's Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, signs the new legislation in the coming days, Michigan will become the first state in nearly 60 years to roll back the right-to-work rules, fulfilling a campaign promise Democrats made to unions before they swept control of both chambers of the Legislature as well as the governor's mansion in November.
"No one should be surprised that we are in this moment," Ms. Whitmer said in an interview. "We've done what we've said we were going to do, and we're going to continue to live up to the promise we made to people and live our values."
But to unions, the damage has been done, after Republicans shocked a state where labor was king and passed right-to-work rules in 2012. Indiana passed the same law that year, and Wisconsin followed suit in 2015 over boisterous protests.
Union membership in Michigan dropped by almost 93,000, from 16 percent to 13 percent in 2021. Certain sectors were more pronounced. Union membership among government employees dropped to 45 percent from 55 percent, and because the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that government workers cannot be compelled to join a union, Michigan Democrats can do nothing to reverse that slide. Unionization at private employers in Michigan has reached 9.1 percent. The free-rider rate -- the number of workers covered by union contracts but not paying union dues -- has tripled, to 14 percent from 3.6 percent, weakening union bargaining power and draining union treasuries.
An analysis published last year by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonpartisan clearinghouse of academic study, looked at work force trends in the five states that have passed right-to-work laws since 2011 -- Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, West Virginia and Kentucky. The findings: States with these laws have unionization rates that are 20 percent lower than states without such laws, while wages in right-to-work states are 7.5 percent lower than states where union dues are compulsory for unionized workplaces.
Michigan Republicans who pushed through the labor law a decade ago said crippling the unions was never a goal. They wanted to see the kind of economic dynamism that right-to-work states in the South have shown, as Mercedes, Boeing, Hyundai, B.M.W. and other manufacturers opened plants there. Jase Bolger, a Republican who was Michigan House speaker at the time, said the economic renaissance in Michigan over the past decade was now at risk.
"This was never about hurting unions -- it was about empowering workers," Mr. Bolger said. "Workers are about to have their freedom to choose stripped away from them, and Democrats are underestimating how workers will respond to that."
The real question might be how the unions respond. Michigan Democrats actually passed two separate repeals -- one for the private sector and one for the public sector -- knowing the government repeal will not withstand a challenge under a 2018 Supreme Court decision.
"There are going to be people who decide not to pay their fair share," said David Hecker, president of the American Federation of Teachers local in Michigan. "We know that."
Ron Bieber, the president of the Michigan A.F.L.-C.I.O., said conditions were ripe for a union comeback. Unemployment is low, the job market is tight and wages are falling behind inflation.
"There's room to grow," he said. "There's always room to grow."
But the once-mighty United Auto Workers union has been in turmoil. It has been locked in a contested leadership election between the longtime chief, Ray Curry, and an insurgent rank-and-file electrician, Shawn Fain, whose core complaint is that the union has grown lazy in fighting to expand and to demand better wages and benefits.
Marick Masters, a business professor and expert on labor at Wayne State University in Detroit, said the U.A.W. represented less than 20 percent of the automotive work force, which makes up only about half of its total membership. Because electric vehicles take fewer workers on final assembly, the union must organize battery plants and other parts suppliers just to tread water, he said.
"The U.A.W. has to organize," Mr. Masters said. "I don't know if it's ready, but its track record would suggest it's not."
Mr. Bieber said the unions that were "fairly devastated" over the past decade were in the service industry, where employees are transient, wages are low and union dues are a difficult pitch.
Mr. Cakmakci with the United Food & Commercial Workers Union in Grand Rapids said his local's membership had declined to 28,500, from 32,000 before right-to-work. Fifteen percent of workers at unionized shops are not paying their dues. Instead of organizing, union leaders spend their time keeping existing workers signed up, filing paperwork to show dues aren't being coerced and answering to Republican demands on compliance.
"Their long game was to bankrupt us," he said. "Their short game was to keep us so busy we can't organize."
There have been advantages. The unions have had to prove their value to members, through new benefits like training and education, scholarships and assistance programs.
When dues were compulsory, "we got lazy, as far as I'm concerned, and the fact that Republicans took advantage of that, that's partly on us," Mr. Cakmakci said. In the right-to-work era, "the job itself became much harder, but it made our union a lot stronger, mentally, physically and intellectually."
"I do think we will be putting together an organizing team again," he added, "but I don't want to go back to ignoring our members."
With so many doubts lingering, it is not clear how the labor law's repeal will help Democrats. Michigan's Democratic lieutenant governor, Garlin Gilchrist II, said he was not looking for a return.
"We've had historic investments in manufacturing, and advanced manufacturing, semiconductor manufacturing in different parts of Michigan," Mr. Gilchrist said in an interview. "We're going to continue to build on that foundation, and that's what the state of Michigan is going to get. It's really not about what Democrats in the Legislature are going to get."
Union leaders are more transactional, acknowledging they are getting a return on the investments they made in Democrats last year.
"Not just union members but working people in general are going to see the difference between what it means to have a worker-friendly administration and legislature and the worker-suppression attacks that we had before," Mr. Bieber said.

Hyundai and Kia Urged
To Fix Theft Vulnerability
A group of 22 U.S. state attorneys general on Monday urged Hyundai Motor and Kia to do more to address millions of U.S. vehicles that are prone to theft.
Last month, the South Korean automakers said they would offer software upgrades to 8.3 million U.S. vehicles to help curb increasing car thefts using a method popularized on TikTok and other social media channels.
The states and the District of Columbia, led by Wisconsin's attorney general, Joshua Kaul, said the automakers had failed to take adequate steps to address the alarming rate of theft and urged them to accelerate the implementation of the software upgrade and provide free alternative protective measures for owners whose cars cannot support the software upgrade.
Hyundai and Kia did not immediately provide a response to a request for comment.
"The surge in thefts of these vulnerable vehicles has been truly shocking," said the letter. REUTERS
POLICY
Rideshare Firms Question Dept. of Labor Nominee
Rideshare and delivery companies want the Biden administration's nominee for the Department of Labor, Julie Su, right, to clarify her position on an incoming worker-classification rule that could expand workers' rights, a trade group representing the companies said on Monday.
The Department of Labor in October proposed a rule that would make it more difficult for companies to treat workers as independent contractors, which would shake up ride-hailing, delivery and other industries that rely on gig workers.
The Flex Association, which represents companies such as Uber and Lyft, sent a letter to Biden on Monday asking that Ms. Su explain how she would implement the proposed rule in a "manner that protects independent work."
The group this month said Ms. Su's record on flexible work was "troubling" and called for a "meticulous review" of her record in the Senate confirmation process.
The final worker classification rule is expected this year.

COMPANIES
New C.E.O. of Starbucks
Officially Takes the Reins
Starbucks said Monday that Laxman Narasimhan has assumed the role of C.E.O. and joined the company's board of directors. Mr. Narasimhan succeeds longtime Starbucks leader Howard Schultz, who came out of retirement last spring to serve as interim chief.
Mr. Schultz will remain on the company's board.
Mr. Narasimhan, 55, most recently served as C.E.O. of Reckitt, a U.K.-based consumer health, hygiene and nutrition company. Before that he was a longtime executive at Pepsico.
Since he was named incoming C.E.O. last September, Mr. Narasimhan has traveled to more than 30 stores, manufacturing plants and support centers around the world, the company said.
The company posted record sales in its most recent quarter, which ended Jan. 1. But Mr. Schultz also faced a growing unionization effort at its U.S. stores, which the company opposes.

Volkswagen Points $193 Billion at E.V.s: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The German automaker announced a plan to accelerate its transition to battery-powered vehicles and bolster operations in China and North America.
Volkswagen said on Tuesday that it would spend $ 193 billion on software, battery factories and other investments as it aimed to make every fifth vehicle it sold electric by 2025.
The automaker, the world's second biggest after Toyota, will also focus on expanding its presence in North America, where it has struggled for years, and becoming more competitive in China, one of its most important markets, said Oliver Blume, Volkswagen's chief executive.
Mr. Blume laid out a 10-point plan for helping Volkswagen pivot to electric vehicles, a path it began in earnest when it effectively abandoned diesel technology after an emissions cheating scandal in 2015. The plan's centerpiece are investments totaling 180 billion euros, or about $ 193 billion. Two-thirds of that sum will be channeled into producing battery cells, developing software and shoring up supply chains of critical raw materials.
"For me, it is important that we have a clear orientation of where we are going," Mr. Blume told reporters, adding that 2023 would be "a decisive year" for the company. It is his first as chief executive; he took over in September from Herbert Diess, who aggressively pushed Volkswagen to embrace electric cars but was forced out after just four years because of disagreements with the company's board.
Mr. Blume hopes to use some of the proceeds of a 2022 initial public offering of Porsche, where he is also chief executive, to strengthen Volkswagen's electrification strategy. The listing brought in €43 billion.
Volkswagen reported a net profit in 2022 of €15.8 billion, or $ 16.7 billion, an increase of 2.6 percent from the previous year, as supply chains disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic began to normalize.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year caused energy prices to rise and contributed to high inflation, especially in Germany. Addressing those challenges, while balancing the demand for combustion-engine vehicles as the company pivots to electric-vehicle production, will be the main focus in Europe, Volkswagen said.
"We must transform ourselves into a technology and mobility services group," Arno Antlitz, Volkswagen's chief financial and operating officer, said at the Tuesday media event. "We need to focus on our platforms, such as our hardware for battery-powered electric vehicles, a unified software stack, batteries, mobility, autonomous driving."
In the short term, Volkswagen will continue to produce combustion-engine cars, which generate profits that the company needs to pay for the transition to battery-powered vehicles. In 2022, Volkswagen sold 8.2 million cars and trucks.
Despite the German government's call for companies to diversify their operations in Asia, pivoting away from China, Volkswagen is continuing to invest in the country in partnerships with local companies.
Volkswagen is the leading producer of combustion-engine vehicles in China, but has lost ground to domestic carmakers in the fast-growing market for electric cars. Last year, Volkswagen introduced an "in China for China" strategy that it plans to expand, including developing technology and software specifically for consumers there, including in-car karaoke.
The automaker's problems in North America are somewhat different. After years of trying to become a bigger player in the United States specifically, it remains far behind U.S. automakers like General Motors and Ford Motor and Asian companies like Toyota and Hyundai.
Volkswagen retooled its plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., last year to begin producing electric vehicles, and it now produces the ID.4 sport utility vehicle there. On Monday, Volkswagen said it had chosen a site in Ontario for a new battery plant. And earlier in March, the company said it would put up a factory in South Carolina to build pickup trucks and S.U.V.s that would be sold under the moribund Scout brand.
In Europe, a key element of the company's focus includes its first battery cell plant, a €2 billion factory that is rising out of a field in Salzgitter, Germany, near the company's headquarters in Wolfsburg. The new plant sits behind a site where Volkswagen has been building engines for more than 50 years and is slated to become the main provider of battery cells for the automaker.

Epidemic of Car Thefts Has Link to Viral Videos: [National Desk]

Full text: Violent crime is largely receding from pandemic highs, but cities face a surge in car thefts, driven in part by videos that show how to hot-wire models by Kia and Hyundai.
One of the busiest places in Memphis these days is the impound lot north of downtown, where tow-truck drivers can sit in line for over six hours to make drop-offs, victims can wait weeks to get stolen vehicles back and some 2,700 cars are squeezed onto the grounds of an old farm-equipment factory.
The overcrowding is the result in part of an auto theft boom that has gripped Memphis and other U.S. cities. Vehicles from two manufacturers, Kia and Hyundai, have proven especially vulnerable to theft, prompting cities to file lawsuits against the carmakers and at least one state's attorney general to open an investigation.
Of the nearly 11,000 cars stolen in Memphis last year -- about twice as many as in 2021 -- roughly a third were late-model Kias and Hyundais, according to the police. It doesn't take much to rip them off: just a screwdriver, a USB cord and hot-wiring know-how found in videos proliferating on social media.
Many of the culprits are teenagers or young adults stealing cars for kicks or to use them for other crimes, such as robberies, the police say. More than half of the 175 people arrested and accused of car theft this year in Memphis were teenagers, who often abandon the vehicles after a joyride.
"We know that a lot of our young people are breaking into cars and stealing cars as almost a dare, or a trend, right now," Cerelyn J. Davis, the Memphis police chief, told the City Council at a recent meeting. "They are finding it easy to do."
American cities have faced a rise in car thefts during the coronavirus pandemic. Some other categories of crime, including homicides and aggravated assaults, rose nationally in 2020 and 2021 and then declined somewhat last year, though they remain above prepandemic levels, according to data collected by the nonpartisan Council on Criminal Justice.
But auto thefts have continued to rise, even as other forms of lawbreaking have leveled out or fallen.
Early in the pandemic, experts who study crime say, more vehicles were stolen partly because people were staying home: Cars were left on streets during the day, rather than in secure parking lots near offices. But the surge has continued, fueled in part by social media videos that show, step by step, how to steal Kias and Hyundais that are not equipped with an engine immobilizer -- an electronic security device that keeps a car from being started without a key.
"All you had to do was put something on TikTok, how to steal these cars, and they started getting stolen left and right," said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, at a news conference last week in Buffalo, where he brandished a USB cord while standing next to recent auto theft victims.
The two Korean car brands, part of the same conglomerate, are increasingly popular in America, accounting for about a 10th of U.S. auto sales last year. They recently issued statements saying they had fixed the problem that makes their vehicles relatively easy to steal in their latest models, and were introducing free software upgrades for vulnerable cars -- about 4.5 million Kias and 3.8 million Hyundais, the federal government estimated.
At the same time, the companies have shipped steering wheel locks to police departments across the country, to be provided free of charge to car owners who drive at-risk models. And executives say they are constantly monitoring TikTok and YouTube for new videos that show how to steal their vehicles, and then alerting the social media companies so those videos can be removed. Kia said in a statement that it was "committed to supporting law enforcement and owners in addressing these crimes."
Representatives for YouTube and TikTok said the companies had removed several videos related to what is known as the "Kia Challenge" in recent months. YouTube said in a statement that it might allow some of the videos to remain if "they're meant to be educational, documentary, scientific or artistic." A TikTok spokesman said the social network "does not condone this behavior, which violates our policies and will be removed if found on our platform."
Julie Garcia of San Antonio said she knew her Kia Sportage was vulnerable to theft, but she hoped it would not be attractive to thieves because the rear bumper was damaged. She also parked in view of security cameras whenever she could.
"It's a scary feeling," she said, "not knowing if your car's going to be there or not."
But on an afternoon in late December, Ms. Garcia found shards of glass on the ground where she had parked. It took the police two days to track down her Sportage. When she retrieved it, she found her steering column ripped apart, a window smashed and trash, including deli meat, strewn inside.
James Lint, a lieutenant with the San Antonio Police Department, said such destruction was common among stolen vehicles. "It's not often we get them back in good condition," he said. "They are torn up, ripped up, marked on, painted on."
Ms. Garcia, 31, is now warning anyone she knows who owns a Kia.
"I'm just trying to spread awareness," she said. "Because I don't want what happened to me to happen to somebody else."
Officials say the social media-driven rise in Kia and Hyundai thefts began about two years ago in Milwaukee, and then spread nationwide. City attorneys for Seattle and Columbus recently sued the automakers for not installing anti-theft technology, and other cities, including Cleveland, Milwaukee and St. Louis, have threatened litigation.
This week, Minnesota's attorney general, Keith Ellison, said he was investigating whether the companies had violated his state's consumer protection and public nuisance laws. "The drastic increase in Kia and Hyundai vehicle thefts is continuing to threaten public safety and do serious harm to our communities," he said in a statement.
The car-theft surge has been the most persistent and wide-ranging crime trend in America during the pandemic, affecting jurisdictions large and small.
In the 30 major cities examined by the Council on Criminal Justice, motor vehicle thefts were up 21 percent last year from 2021 -- resulting in an estimated 37,560 more stolen cars in those places. This followed double-digit increases in 2020 and 2021. (Carjackings, categorized as a violent crime and counted separately, have also risen in some cities.)
Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist at the University of Missouri and the lead author of the council's report, said the social media phenomenon was only part of the problem. "There is no definitive explanation for this large and sustained increase in motor vehicle theft," he said. "It seems, in my view, to have taken on the characteristic of something like a contagion."
Sometimes, officials say, the stolen cars are linked to other crimes, deadly crashes and even vigilantism, as car-theft victims take matters into their own hands after locating their vehicles with trackers.
In St. Louis last year, the drivers of two stolen cars -- one a Hyundai, the other a Kia -- were involved in a shootout at a busy intersection near downtown, leaving a 17-year-old with a gunshot wound. And a woman in St. Louis County was charged with murder after the police said she tracked down her stolen Hyundai in late December and killed two men.
In Buffalo, four teenagers riding in a stolen Kia were killed in October when they crashed into a wall on an expressway and flew through the car's glass roof. And Mr. Ellison, the Minnesota attorney general, said that stolen Kias and Hyundais in Minneapolis were linked to five homicides, 13 shootings, 36 robberies and 265 vehicle accidents last year.
Columbus, which has sued both carmakers to recoup the costs in city resources devoted to dealing with the rise in thefts, is seeing an average of 17 Kias and Hyundais stolen each day, said Zach Klein, the city attorney.
"These are used cars that a lot of retail and middle-class workers drive," he said, adding that there was "this cascading effect not only to law enforcement that are dealing with it but also to the everyday citizens in our community that are the victims of these crimes and then don't have an alternative vehicle to get to work."
Owners of Kias and Hyundais have taken to cautioning one another to be on the lookout. On the week before Christmas, Tylar Talkington was leaving her apartment in Phoenix to buy ice cream when she found her Kia Soul missing. On the ground where she had parked it was a grapefruit-size rock amid shards of glass.
Ms. Talkington, 33, filed a police report. When she told her family what had happened, she learned about the social media trend. "I guess there's a TikTok challenge going around -- the Kia boys, they call themselves -- just showing you how to commit grand theft auto, online," she said.
She left a note on a neighbor's Kia, warning her about the theft. The next night, after retrieving her car, with its steering column ripped open and its interior a mess, Ms. Talkington saw that her neighbor's car was missing.
"There was another police car in the apartment complex," she said. "And a pile of broken glass where my neighbor's car should have been."

One of the busiest places in Memphis, Tennessee, these days is the impound lot north of downtown, where tow-truck drivers can sit in line for more than six hours to make drop-offs, victims can wait weeks to get stolen vehicles back and some 2,700 cars are squeezed onto the grounds of an old farm-equipment factory.
The overcrowding is the result in part of an auto theft boom that has gripped Memphis and other U.S. cities. Vehicles from two manufacturers, Kia and Hyundai, have proved especially vulnerable to theft, prompting cities to file lawsuits against the carmakers and at least one state’s attorney general to open an investigation.
Of the nearly 11,000 cars stolen in Memphis last year — about twice as many as in 2021 — roughly one-third were late-model Kias and Hyundais, according to police. It doesn’t take much to rip them off: just a screwdriver, a USB cord and hot-wiring know-how found in videos proliferating on social media.
Many of the culprits are teenagers or young adults stealing cars for kicks or to use them for other crimes, such as robberies, police say. More than half of the 175 people arrested and accused of car theft this year in Memphis were teenagers, who often abandon the vehicles after a joyride.
“We know that a lot of our young people are breaking into cars and stealing cars as almost a dare, or a trend, right now,” Cerelyn J. Davis, the Memphis police chief, told the City Council at a recent meeting. “They are finding it easy to do.”
U.S. cities have faced a rise in car thefts during the coronavirus pandemic. Some other categories of crime, including homicides and aggravated assaults, rose nationally in 2020 and 2021 and then declined somewhat last year, though they remain above prepandemic levels, according to data collected by the nonpartisan Council on Criminal Justice.
But auto thefts have continued to rise, even as other forms of lawbreaking have leveled out or fallen.
Early in the pandemic, experts who study crime say, more vehicles were stolen partly because people were staying home: Cars were left on streets during the day, rather than in secure parking lots near offices.

U.S. and Europe Seek New Trade Deal to Resolve Climate Dispute: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: American and European officials are trying to reach agreement on the outlines of a limited trade deal that could help resolve a major rift over America's new climate legislation.
WASHINGTON -- American and European officials meeting in Washington this week are trying to agree on the outlines of a limited trade deal that would allow European companies to qualify for some of the benefits of the Biden administration's new climate legislation, in a bid to assuage a major source of tension between the allies.
The governments hope to announce their intention to begin negotiations over an agreement focusing on the critical minerals that go into electric vehicle batteries as soon as Friday, when President Biden is set to meet with Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, at the White House.
American officials have also been carrying out similar conversations with the governments of Japan and the United Kingdom to see if some type of limited new agreement could be struck that would also offer Japanese and British companies certain benefits under the law.
At the center of the debate is the Inflation Reduction Act, a $ 370 billion bill that President Biden signed last year to try to mitigate climate change by transforming U.S. power generation and the car industry. The bill offers generous tax credits to American consumers to purchase new and used electric vehicles, but it imposes tough restrictions on the types of vehicles that can benefit from these rules, in ways that disadvantage foreign carmakers.
The law specifies that, to receive a tax credit, cars must be assembled in North America and source the material for their batteries from North America, or from countries with which the United States has a free-trade agreement. Despite close ties, the United States does not have a free-trade agreement with the European Union, Japan or the United Kingdom.
The passage of the law has prompted harsh criticism from allies, who say companies in their countries will be penalized. European officials have been particularly outspoken, arguing that the bill comes at a delicate time for a European economy that is already contending with disruptions from the war in Ukraine and skyrocketing energy prices.
The dispute has raised the prospect of a subsidy war between the United States and the European Union, and threatened to strain relations at a time when both sides are trying to maintain a united front against Russia.
"I don't think U.S. government officials anticipated this level of pushback and this level of disdain against this massive climate bill," said Olga Khakova, the deputy director for European energy security at the Atlantic Council's Global Energy Center. But she said emotions had now subsided a bit. "We are in this mode right now where we want to find a solution."
The rift has set off a scramble within the U.S. government to try to scrape together some type of new trade deal that could be signed with allied governments to allow their companies to benefit from some of the law's tax credits. With such an agreement, for example, a company based in the European Union could help to supply lithium, nickel or other battery materials for electric vehicles made in North America.
A Treasury official said that any new trade agreements would be evaluated during a rule-making process to ensure that they comply with the critical mineral requirements in the legislation. The official pointed to Chinese control over the critical mineral supply as a reason for the need for the United States to team up with like-minded countries.
A U.S. official said that the administration had been engaged in consultations with Congress about such an agreement, and that those briefings, and conversations with unions and private industry, would continue in the coming weeks.
The Treasury Department, in a white paper published in December, said that the Inflation Reduction Act did not define the term "free trade agreement," and that the Treasury secretary could identify additional free-trade agreements for the purposes of the critical-minerals requirement going forward.
Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said last month that the Biden administration was considering limited trade deals focused on critical minerals as a solution, and she suggested that these could be done without the approval of Congress. She emphasized that the intent of the law was not for the United States to steal jobs from Europe and that the law was meant to be aligned with the administration's "friend-shoring" agenda.
"I think the word 'free trade' was meant to mean reliable friends and partners with whom we can feel we have secure supply chains," Ms. Yellen said on the sidelines of the Group of 20 finance ministers meetings in India last month. "We've been very clear with Europe that this is not a subsidy war."
With input from the Office of the United States Trade Representative, officials from the Treasury Department have prepared a document spelling out what kind of deal would constitute a "free-trade agreement" for the purposes of the legislation, according to people familiar with the plans.
It is not clear how quickly the solution could be completed, however, as the white paper said the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service would seek public comment on "what criteria should be used to identify free-trade agreements for the purposes of the critical-minerals requirement."
In a briefing on Friday, a European official said Europe and the United States could announce by the end of this week a commitment to forge a new limited trade deal, most likely focused on supply chains for critical minerals. Unlike a traditional free-trade agreement, which entails reducing barriers to trade between partners, this agreement would not involve lowering tariffs on either side, and the parties would aim to flesh out the agreement in days or weeks, rather than months, the European official said.
The official added that the agreement would need to be legally binding, and would still involve seeking some type of approval from European Union member states. In the United States, the agreement could come in the form of an executive order from the Biden administration, and without requiring the approval of Congress, the official suggested.
One irony is that neither the European Union nor the United States is a major source of the critical minerals needed for electric vehicle batteries. But some officials have suggested that the partnership would form a foundation for a group that could be expanded over time to include countries with larger supplies of lithium, cobalt, nickel and other minerals.
In a speech at the World Economic Forum in January, Ms. Von der Leyen spoke about building "a critical raw materials club" with like-minded partners, including the United States, to strengthen supply chains and overcome China's "existing monopoly."
While analysts said a new deal with Europe could in practice satisfy the requirements of the law, it would not really resemble a free-trade agreement, as such agreements have come to be understood.
Free-trade deals are legal agreements that the World Trade Organization defines as covering "substantially all trade" between countries, including a broad range of goods and, typically, services. They usually take years to negotiate and, in the United States, require the approval of Congress.
Scott Lincicome, the director of general economics at the Cato Institute, said that the Biden administration's authority to strike such trade pacts was questionable but that it was unlikely that anyone would try to mount a legal challenge to them.
"Everyone in the room knows that this is not kosher, but there's not really anything anybody can do about it," Mr. Lincicome said.
Political appetite for striking new free-trade deals has diminished in the United States in recent years, in part because of a perception that such pacts have helped multinational corporations move factories and jobs offshore.
Efforts to strike expansive trade deals with Europe and a group of Asian countries during the Obama administration fizzled, in part because of that political opposition. During the Trump administration, the United States signed a series of limited trade deals with South Korea, Japan and China that were carried out through executive orders, not by congressional approval.
Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that the limited deal would mollify the Europeans, and that U.S.-E.U. economic relations were too important "to not allow the Europeans under the tent in some way or another." But it could escalate complaints from other trading partners, like South Korea, that don't feel as though their concerns have been taken care of, he said.
South Korea already has a comprehensive free-trade agreement with the United States, but it has other criticisms of the climate law, centering on how the current terms exclude electric vehicles made by Hyundai from receiving tax credits. "Once you make accommodations for one, the pressure grows to make accommodations for others," he said.
It remains unclear how Congress will respond. Some lawmakers have expressed concerns that the administration is not adhering to the law's original intent of promoting U.S. manufacturing. Many also disapprove of efforts by the executive branch to bypass congressional authority in approving trade deals.
But Democrats may also be sympathetic to the effort to smooth over relations with Europeans, and reluctant to reopen debate over their signature climate legislation. And at least one key lawmaker, Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, has said he didn't realize that the European Union lacked a free-trade agreement with the United States in the first place.
Still, the dispute has elicited some criticism that American officials are going to great lengths to mollify Europeans, especially given that the European Union imposes some trade barriers on the United States, like a relatively high tariff on imported U.S. cars.
John G. Murphy, the senior vice president for international policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said it was his group's view that the Biden administration should fight against various E.U. policies that discriminate against American companies "with the same doggedness European officials have brought to their complaints about the I.R.A."

WASHINGTON — American and European officials meeting in Washington this week are trying to agree on the outlines of a limited trade deal that would allow European companies to qualify for some of the benefits of the Biden administration’s new climate legislation, in a bid to assuage a major source of tension between the allies.
The governments hope to announce their intention to begin negotiations over an agreement focusing on the critical minerals that go into electric vehicle batteries as soon as Friday, when President Joe Biden is set to meet with Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, at the White House.
U.S. officials have also been carrying out similar conversations with the governments of Japan and the United Kingdom to see if some type of limited new agreement could be struck that would also offer Japanese and British companies certain benefits under the law.
At the center of the debate is the Inflation Reduction Act, a $370 billion bill that President Joe Biden signed last year to try to mitigate climate change by transforming U.S. power generation and the car industry. The bill offers generous tax credits to American consumers to purchase new and used electric vehicles, but it imposes tough restrictions on the types of vehicles that can benefit from these rules, in ways that disadvantage foreign carmakers.
The law specifies that, to receive a tax credit, cars must be assembled in North America and source the material for their batteries from North America, or from countries with which the United States has a free-trade agreement. Despite close ties, the United States does not have a free-trade agreement with the European Union, Japan or the United Kingdom.
The passage of the law has prompted harsh criticism from allies, who say companies in their countries will be penalized. European officials have been particularly outspoken, arguing that the bill comes at a delicate time for a European economy that is already contending with disruptions from the war in Ukraine and skyrocketing energy prices.
The dispute has raised the prospect of a subsidy war between the United States and the European Union, and threatened to strain relations at a time when both sides are trying to maintain a united front against Russia.
“I don’t think U.S. government officials anticipated this level of pushback and this level of disdain against this massive climate bill,” said Olga Khakova, the deputy director for European energy security at the Atlantic Council’s Global Energy Center. But she said emotions had now subsided a bit. “We are in this mode right now where we want to find a solution.”
The rift has set off a scramble within the U.S. government to try to scrape together some type of new trade deal that could be signed with allied governments to allow their companies to benefit from some of the law’s tax credits. With such an agreement, for example, a company based in the European Union could help to supply lithium, nickel or other battery materials for electric vehicles made in North America.
A Treasury official said that any new trade agreements would be evaluated during a rule-making process to ensure that they comply with the critical mineral requirements in the legislation. The official pointed to Chinese control over the critical mineral supply as a reason for the need for the United States to team up with like-minded countries.
A U.S. official said that the administration had been engaged in consultations with Congress about such an agreement, and that those briefings, and conversations with unions and private industry, would continue in the coming weeks.
The Treasury Department, in a white paper published in December, said that the Inflation Reduction Act did not define the term “free trade agreement,” and that the Treasury secretary could identify additional free-trade agreements for the purposes of the critical-minerals requirement going forward.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said last month that the Biden administration was considering limited trade deals focused on critical minerals as a solution, and she suggested that these could be done without the approval of Congress. She emphasized that the intent of the law was not for the United States to steal jobs from Europe and that the law was meant to be aligned with the administration’s “friend-shoring” agenda.
“I think the word ‘free trade’ was meant to mean reliable friends and partners with whom we can feel we have secure supply chains,” Yellen said on the sidelines of the Group of 20 finance ministers meetings in India last month. “We’ve been very clear with Europe that this is not a subsidy war.”
With input from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, officials from the Treasury Department have prepared a document spelling out what kind of deal would constitute a “free-trade agreement” for the purposes of the legislation, according to people familiar with the plans.
It is not clear how quickly the solution could be completed, however, as the white paper said the Treasury Department and the IRS would seek public comment on “what criteria should be used to identify free-trade agreements for the purposes of the critical-minerals requirement.”
In a briefing Friday, a European official said Europe and the United States could announce by the end of this week a commitment to forge a new limited trade deal, most likely focused on supply chains for critical minerals. Unlike a traditional free-trade agreement, which entails reducing barriers to trade between partners, this agreement would not involve lowering tariffs on either side, and the parties would aim to flesh out the agreement in days or weeks, rather than months, the European official said.
The official added that the agreement would need to be legally binding, and would still involve seeking some type of approval from European Union member states. In the United States, the agreement could come in the form of an executive order from the Biden administration, without requiring the approval of Congress, the official suggested.
One irony is that neither the European Union nor the United States is a major source of the critical minerals needed for electric vehicle batteries. But some officials have suggested that the partnership would form a foundation for a group that could be expanded over time to include countries with larger supplies of lithium, cobalt, nickel and other minerals.
In a speech at the World Economic Forum in January, von der Leyen spoke about building “a critical raw materials club” with like-minded partners, including the United States, to strengthen supply chains and overcome China’s “existing monopoly.”
While analysts said a new deal with Europe could in practice satisfy the requirements of the law, it would not really resemble a free-trade agreement, as such agreements have come to be understood.
Free-trade deals are legal agreements that the World Trade Organization defines as covering “substantially all trade” between countries, including a broad range of goods and, typically, services. They usually take years to negotiate and, in the United States, require the approval of Congress.
Scott Lincicome, the director of general economics at the Cato Institute, said that the Biden administration’s authority to strike such trade pacts was questionable but that it was unlikely that anyone would try to mount a legal challenge to them.
“Everyone in the room knows that this is not kosher, but there’s not really anything anybody can do about it,” Lincicome said.
Political appetite for striking new free-trade deals has diminished in the United States in recent years, in part because of a perception that such pacts have helped multinational corporations move factories and jobs offshore.
Efforts to strike expansive trade deals with Europe and a group of Asian countries during the Obama administration fizzled, in part because of that political opposition. During the Trump administration, the United States signed a series of limited trade deals with South Korea, Japan and China that were carried out through executive orders, not by congressional approval.
Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that the limited deal would mollify the Europeans, and that U.S.-EU economic relations were too important “to not allow the Europeans under the tent in some way or another.” But it could escalate complaints from other trading partners, like South Korea, that don’t feel as though their concerns have been taken care of, he said.
South Korea has a comprehensive free-trade agreement with the United States, but it has other criticisms of the climate law, centering on how the current terms exclude electric vehicles made by Hyundai from receiving tax credits. “Once you make accommodations for one, the pressure grows to make accommodations for others,” Alden said.
It remains unclear how Congress will respond. Some lawmakers have expressed concerns that the administration is not adhering to the law’s original intent of promoting U.S. manufacturing. Many also disapprove of efforts by the executive branch to bypass congressional authority in approving trade deals.
But Democrats may also be sympathetic to the effort to smooth over relations with Europeans, and reluctant to reopen debate over their signature climate legislation. And at least one key lawmaker, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., has said he didn’t realize that the European Union lacked a free-trade agreement with the United States in the first place.
Still, the dispute has elicited some criticism that American officials are going to great lengths to mollify Europeans, especially given that the European Union imposes some trade barriers on the United States, like a relatively high tariff on imported U.S. cars.
John G.

Armies Pared, Europe Lacks Tanks for Kyiv: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The struggle to deliver on promises to provide Leopard 2 tanks for use against Russian forces has exposed just how unprepared European militaries are.
BERLIN -- Nearly a month after Berlin gave European allies permission to send German-made tanks to Ukraine, the flow of tanks so many leaders vowed would follow seems more like a trickle.
Some nations have discovered that the tanks in their armory don't actually work or lack spare parts. Political leaders have encountered unanticipated resistance within their own coalitions, and even from their defense ministries. And some armies had to pull trainers out of retirement to teach Ukrainian soldiers how to use old-model tanks.
The struggle to provide Leopard tanks to an embattled Ukraine is just the most glaring manifestation of a reality Europe has long ignored: Believing that large-scale land war was a thing of the past and basking in the thaw of the Cold War, nations chronically underfunded their militaries. When Russia launched the largest land war on the continent since World War II, they were woefully unprepared.
Hints of the problem have surfaced repeatedly since Russia invaded Ukraine a year ago, through shortages of weapons and ammunition. But now, as Germany and its allies struggled for weeks to scrape together enough Leopard 2s to fill two battalions of tanks -- 62 vehicles in total -- the extent of their quandary has become even clearer.
The irony of this situation is not lost on Germany.
For weeks, Chancellor Olaf Scholz resisted an intense public pressure campaign from Ukraine's leaders, European politicians and security experts to supply Kyiv with tanks, and to permit other nations to send some of their own Leopards, despite German concerns that it could be perceived by Russia as a NATO escalation. Many goaded Mr. Scholz with a social media campaign: #Freetheleopards.
The Leopards may be free now, but they are scarce on the ground. And some countries that clamored for permission to send them to Ukraine are having difficulties doing so, or second thoughts of their own.
Despite Europe having an estimated 2,000 Leopard 2 tanks of different models -- they are among the most commonly used main battle tanks across the continent -- pledges for Ukraine are still short of the hundreds it says it needs.
Germany has offered 18, and Poland another 14, but the numbers drop from there. And once the currently pledged tanks go into battle and get hit or break down, it is not clear which Leopards -- or which country -- will replace them.
"Of course some nations have delivered, or at least announced that they will," Germany's defense minister, Boris Pistorius, said at the Munich Security Conference this month. "But others have not done that."
"That is what I'm a bit shocked about," he added. "Clearly there were some nations -- and I will never name names here -- but we had some nations that preferred to hide behind Germany. To say: We would love to, if we were allowed. But when we allowed it, they didn't do anything."
Privately, many German and European officials involved in the negotiations over tank deliveries say the situation is more complicated. It is not so much that nations are unwilling to make good on their promises but rather that they have faced a rude awakening as to just how difficult it is.
Finland, where many outspoken members of Parliament led the calls for Germany to allow Leopard deliveries, announced on Thursday that it would supply three Leopard mine-clearing vehicles -- but none of its estimated 200 Leopard main battle tanks.
Some German officials expressed sympathy for Finland, which is not yet a NATO member and has Europe's longest border with Russia, some 830 miles. It does not want to weaken its defenses now that Russia has shown a willingness to attack a sovereign neighbor.
But some European officials were hoping for a larger contribution from Finland, given promises from the United States and Britain to come to its defense if necessary, even before NATO accession.
Nordic countries such as Sweden, which had long pushed for Leopard deliveries but on Friday offered only "up to" 10, are facing another unexpected problem, several German officials said: While their politicians and members of the public appear keen to offer tanks to Ukraine, their militaries are not.
For decades, European countries enjoying a post-Cold War "peace dividend" had seen war as almost a thing of the past, regularly cutting military support. Now, the shrunken armies tend to be protective of what they still have. At NATO, European militaries are sometimes called "bonsai armies," after the miniature trees.
For years, the United States has been nagging Europe to increase military spending, and in 2014, after Russia grabbed Crimea, NATO members agreed to spend 2 percent of GDP by 2024. Yet even today, by current NATO estimates, only nine of the alliance's 30 members are spending that much, while a 10th is close. Thirteen countries, including Germany, were spending around 1.5 percent of their G.D.P. or even less.
In Germany, which for years clung to a foreign policy that emphasized aid and development more than hard power, some saw the problem as uniquely German. Yearly military reports to Parliament offered sometimes comical glimpses of the shortages. Commandos conducted water training at local public pools, because their own facilities were shut down. Planes could not fly. Soldiers trained with broomsticks instead of rifles. Even newer Puma infantry fighting vehicles recently broke down en masse.
But other European nations are now realizing their own militaries may have similar troubles.
"The trend across the board in European armies has been cutting, cutting, cutting," said Christian Mölling, a defense expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations. "But at the end of the day, many were on the same track as Germany: War is a theoretical thing. So we have theoretical tanks."
Spain, which has 108 Leopard 2A4 tanks, early on sought German permission to offer some of its vehicles to Ukraine. Now it has discovered that many of them are in poor condition and need refurbishment that could take weeks or months. On top of that, one of the prime minister's coalition partners, the leftist Podemos party, is closer to Russia and has been resistant to offering more support for Ukraine.
Nevertheless, as Germany turned the pressure back on its allies for their shortcomings, Spain's prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, on Friday improved on his promise to send six Leopards and said Spain would now send 10.
Ulrike Franke, a defense analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said the struggle to find tank numbers raises questions as to where else European militaries face similar shortages and maintenance problems.
"Is it just bad luck that Spain has an issue with their Leopard tanks, but everything else works?" she said. "Or do they have the same issues elsewhere?"
"Does 10 percent of their equipment not work, or is it 50 percent?" Ms. Franke asked. "It would be a good idea for Europeans to look at this more closely."
Poland, which has difficult relations with Germany, was foremost in pressing Mr. Scholz and Berlin on the Leopards, and even threatened to send some to Ukraine without the necessary German permission. Like Berlin, Warsaw has some 200 Leopard 2 tanks -- but it says it will provide just 14. It sent the first of the tanks to Ukraine on the anniversary of the invasion, Feb. 24, although Poland has yet to finish training Ukrainian soldiers how to use them.
Warsaw may be holding off on deliveries of Leopards until it receives new Hyundai-made K2 tanks from South Korea, meant to replace the German model, some analysts said. Poland has sent many upgraded Soviet-era T-72 tanks to Ukraine.
But some European officials think Warsaw should be offering more Leopards, and some policymakers are planning meetings with Polish officials this week to better understand the situation. Even when it comes to the tanks that are in large supply -- namely, the older Leopard 1 models -- there are complications.
The Netherlands, Germany and Denmark have launched a joint initiative to refurbish and send 150 Leopard 1 models to Ukraine by the end of the year. But at a training session for Ukrainian soldiers in Germany earlier this week, one general said militaries had been forced to seek out retired Leopard 1 tank drivers to come back and help train Ukrainian forces. The old model is too unfamiliar to current militaries.
As politicized as the Leopard issue has become, Gustav Gressel, a security analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, argued that there were plenty of solutions if European nations worked together.
The Dutch, for instance, lease 18 Leopards from Germany. Officials are discussing whether it would be possible for Germany to take some of them to use in place of its own Leopards in Lithuania and then send those to Ukraine.
Switzerland, sticking to its constitutional neutrality, refuses to send any of its 134 Leopard tanks to Ukraine. But it is willing to give the tanks to European Union members, Mr. Gressel said. Countries like Finland or Poland, he said, could request the Swiss tanks and send their own to Ukraine.
Another option would be for countries to simply buy more Leopards, made by the German companies Rheinmetall and Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, and send their current models to Ukraine. But European governments and the defense industry are currently in a standoff over production.
State leaders want industry to move first, while weapons makers want longer-term government orders before they step up production. If more government orders are made, analysts say, the more capacity may increase, thus speeding up production of weapons like tanks.
At current rates, militaries would face a serious tank shortage for the two to three years it would take the industry to make the new vehicles, security experts say -- a long waiting period politicians across Europe are learning their armies are fiercely resistant to accept.
That is why Mr. Gressel argued the tanks should be sent now anyway.
"Yes," he said, "Russia will reconstitute itself as a military threat to NATO after this war. But it will take years for them to come back as a military threat. They have to rebuild an army which is shattered and almost destroyed in Ukraine."

Full text: Arriving in record numbers, they're ending up in dangerous jobs that violate child labor laws -- including in factories that make products for well-known brands like Cheetos and Fruit of the Loom.
It was almost midnight in Grand Rapids, Mich., but inside the factory everything was bright. A conveyor belt carried bags of Cheerios past a cluster of young workers. One was 15-year-old Carolina Yoc, who came to the United States on her own last year to live with a relative she had never met.
About every 10 seconds, she stuffed a sealed plastic bag of cereal into a passing yellow carton. It could be dangerous work, with fast-moving pulleys and gears that had torn off fingers and ripped open a woman's scalp.
The factory was full of underage workers like Carolina, who had crossed the Southern border by themselves and were now spending late hours bent over hazardous machinery, in violation of child labor laws. At nearby plants, other children were tending giant ovens to make Chewy and Nature Valley granola bars and packing bags of Lucky Charms and Cheetos -- all of them working for the processing giant Hearthside Food Solutions, which would ship these products around the country.
"Sometimes I get tired and feel sick," Carolina said after a shift in November. Her stomach often hurt, and she was unsure if that was because of the lack of sleep, the stress from the incessant roar of the machines, or the worries she had for herself and her family in Guatemala. "But I'm getting used to it."
These workers are part of a new economy of exploitation: Migrant children, who have been coming into the United States without their parents in record numbers, are ending up in some of the most punishing jobs in the country, a New York Times investigation found. This shadow work force extends across industries in every state, flouting child labor laws that have been in place for nearly a century. Twelve-year-old roofers in Florida and Tennessee. Underage slaughterhouse workers in Delaware, Mississippi and North Carolina. Children sawing planks of wood on overnight shifts in South Dakota.
Largely from Central America, the children are driven by economic desperation that was worsened by the pandemic. This labor force has been slowly growing for almost a decade, but it has exploded since 2021, while the systems meant to protect children have broken down.
The Times spoke with more than 100 migrant child workers in 20 states who described jobs that were grinding them into exhaustion, and fears that they had become trapped in circumstances they never could have imagined. The Times examination also drew on court and inspection records and interviews with hundreds of lawyers, social workers, educators and law enforcement officials.
In town after town, children scrub dishes late at night. They run milking machines in Vermont and deliver meals in New York City. They harvest coffee and build lava rock walls around vacation homes in Hawaii. Girls as young as 13 wash hotel sheets in Virginia.
In many parts of the country, middle and high school teachers in English-language learner programs say it is now common for nearly all their students to rush off to long shifts after their classes end.
"They should not be working 12-hour days, but it's happening here," said Valeria Lindsay, a language arts teacher at Homestead Middle School near Miami. For the past three years, she said, almost every eighth grader in her English learner program of about 100 students was also carrying an adult workload.
Migrant child labor benefits both under-the-table operations and global corporations, The Times found. In Los Angeles, children stitch "Made in America" tags into J. Crew shirts. They bake dinner rolls sold at Walmart and Target, process milk used in Ben & Jerry's ice cream and help debone chicken sold at Whole Foods. As recently as the fall, middle-schoolers made Fruit of the Loom socks in Alabama. In Michigan, children make auto parts used by Ford and General Motors.
The number of unaccompanied minors entering the United States climbed to a high of 130,000 last year -- three times what it was five years earlier -- and this summer is expected to bring another wave.
These are not children who have stolen into the country undetected. The federal government knows they are in the United States, and the Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for ensuring sponsors will support them and protect them from trafficking or exploitation.
But as more and more children have arrived, the Biden White House has ramped up demands on staffers to move the children quickly out of shelters and release them to adults. Caseworkers say they rush through vetting sponsors.
While H.H.S. checks on all minors by calling them a month after they begin living with their sponsors, data obtained by The Times showed that over the last two years, the agency could not reach more than 85,000 children. Overall, the agency lost immediate contact with a third of migrant children.
An H.H.S. spokeswoman said the agency wanted to release children swiftly, for the sake of their well-being, but had not compromised safety. "There are numerous places along the process to continually ensure that a placement is in the best interest of the child," said the spokeswoman, Kamara Jones.
Far from home, many of these children are under intense pressure to earn money. They send cash back to their families while often being in debt to their sponsors for smuggling fees, rent and living expenses.
"It's getting to be a business for some of these sponsors," said Annette Passalacqua, who left her job as a caseworker in Central Florida last year. Ms. Passalacqua said she saw so many children put to work, and found law enforcement officials so unwilling to investigate these cases, that she largely stopped reporting them. Instead, she settled for explaining to the children that they were entitled to lunch breaks and overtime.
Sponsors are required to send migrant children to school, and some students juggle classes and heavy workloads. Other children arrive to find that they have been misled by their sponsors and will not be enrolled in school.
The federal government hires child welfare agencies to track some minors who are deemed to be at high risk. But caseworkers at those agencies said that H.H.S. regularly ignored obvious signs of labor exploitation, a characterization the agency disputed.
In interviews with more than 60 caseworkers, most independently estimated that about two-thirds of all unaccompanied migrant children ended up working full time.
A representative for Hearthside said the company relied on a staffing agency to supply some workers for its plants in Grand Rapids, but conceded that it had not required the agency to verify ages through a national system that checks Social Security numbers. Unaccompanied migrant children often obtain false identification to secure work.
"We are immediately implementing additional controls to reinforce all agencies' strict compliance with our longstanding requirement that all workers must be 18 or over," the company said in a statement.
At Union High School in Grand Rapids, Carolina's ninth-grade social studies teacher, Rick Angstman, has seen the toll that long shifts take on his students. One, who was working nights at a commercial laundry, began passing out in class from fatigue and was hospitalized twice, he said. Unable to stop working, she dropped out of school.
"She disappeared into oblivion," Mr. Angstman said. "It's the new child labor. You're taking children from another country and putting them in almost indentured servitude."
On the Night Shift
When Carolina left Guatemala, she had no real understanding of what she was heading toward, just a sense that she could not stay in her village any longer. There was not much electricity or water, and after the pandemic began, not much food.
The only people who seemed to be getting by were the families living off remittances from relatives in the United States. Carolina lived alone with her grandmother, whose health began failing. When neighbors started talking about heading north, she decided to join. She was 14.
"I just kept walking," she said.
Carolina reached the U.S. border exhausted, weighing 84 pounds. Agents sent her to an H.H.S. shelter in Arizona, where a caseworker contacted her aunt, Marcelina Ramirez. Ms. Ramirez was at first reluctant: She had already sponsored two other relatives and had three children of her own. They were living on $ 600 a week, and she didn't know Carolina.
When Carolina arrived in Grand Rapids last year, Ms. Ramirez told her she would go to school every morning and suggested that she pick up evening shifts at Hearthside. She knew Carolina needed to send money back to her grandmother. She also believed it was good for young people to work. Child labor is the norm in rural Guatemala, and she herself had started working around the second grade.
One of the nation's largest contract manufacturers, Hearthside makes and packages food for companies like Frito-Lay, General Mills and Quaker Oats. "It would be hard to find a cookie or cracker aisle in any leading grocer that does not contain multiple products from Hearthside production facilities," a Grand Rapids-area plant manager told a trade magazine in 2019.
General Mills, whose brands include Cheerios, Lucky Charms and Nature Valley, said it recognized "the seriousness of this situation" and was reviewing The Times's findings. PepsiCo, which owns Frito-Lay and Quaker Oats, declined to comment.
Three people who until last year worked at one of the biggest employment agencies in Grand Rapids, Forge Industrial Staffing, said Hearthside supervisors were sometimes made aware that they were getting young-looking workers whose identities had been flagged as false.
"Hearthside didn't care," said Nubia Malacara, a former Forge employee who said she had also worked at Hearthside as a minor.
In a statement, Hearthside said, "We do care deeply about this issue and are concerned about the mischaracterization of Hearthside." A spokesman for Forge said it complied with state and federal laws and "would never knowingly employ individuals under 18."
Kevin Tomas said he sought work through Forge after he arrived in Grand Rapids at age 13 with his 7-year-old brother. At first, he was sent to a local manufacturer that made auto parts for Ford and General Motors. But his shift ended at 6:30 in the morning, so he could not stay awake in school, and he struggled to lift the heavy boxes.
"It's not that we want to be working these jobs. It's that we have to help our families," Kevin said.
By the time he was 15, Kevin had found a job at Hearthside, stacking 50-pound cases of cereal on the same shift as Carolina.
'So Many Red Flags'
The growth of migrant child labor in the United States over the past several years is a result of a chain of willful ignorance. Companies ignore the young faces in their back rooms and on their factory floors. Schools often decline to report apparent labor violations, believing it will hurt children more than help. And H.H.S. behaves as if the migrant children who melt unseen into the country are doing just fine.
"As the government, we've turned a blind eye to their trafficking," said Doug Gilmer, the head of the Birmingham, Ala., office of Homeland Security Investigations, a federal agency that often becomes involved with immigration cases.
Mr. Gilmer teared up as he recalled finding 13-year-olds working in meat plants; 12-year-olds working at suppliers for Hyundai and Kia, as documented last year by a Reuters investigation; and children who should have been in middle school working at commercial bakeries.
"We're encountering it here because we're looking for it here," Mr. Gilmer said. "It's happening everywhere."
Children have crossed the Southern border on their own for decades, and since 2008, the United States has allowed non-Mexican minors to live with sponsors while they go through immigration proceedings, which can take several years. The policy, codified in anti-trafficking legislation, is intended to prevent harm to children who would otherwise be turned away and left alone in a Mexican border town.
When Kelsey Keswani first worked as an H.H.S. contractor in Arizona to connect unaccompanied migrant children with sponsors in 2010, the adults were almost always the children's parents, who had paid smugglers to bring them up from Central America, she said.
But around 2014, the number of arriving children began to climb, and their circumstances were different. In recent years, "the kids almost all have a debt to pay off, and they're super stressed about it," Ms. Keswani said.
She began to see more failures in the vetting process. "There were so many cases where sponsors had sponsored multiple kids, and it wasn't getting caught. So many red flags with debt. So many reports of trafficking."
Now, just a third of migrant children are going to their parents. A majority are sent to other relatives, acquaintances or even strangers, a Times analysis of federal data showed. Nearly half are coming from Guatemala, where poverty is fueling a wave of migration. Parents know that they would be turned away at the border or quickly deported, so they send their children in hopes that remittances will come back.
In the last two years alone, more than 250,000 children have entered the United States by themselves.
The shifting dynamics in Central America helped create a political crisis early in Mr. Biden's presidency, when children started crossing the border faster than H.H.S. could process them. With no room left in shelters, the children stayed in jail-like facilities run by Customs and Border Protection and, later, in tent cities. The images of children sleeping on gym mats under foil blankets attracted intense media attention.
The Biden administration pledged to move children through the shelter system more quickly. "We don't want to continue to see a child languish in our care if there is a responsible sponsor," Xavier Becerra, secretary of health and human services, told Congress in 2021.
His agency began paring back protections that had been in place for years, including some background checks and reviews of children's files, according to memos reviewed by The Times and interviews with more than a dozen current and former employees.
"Twenty percent of kids have to be released every week or you get dinged," said Ms. Keswani, who stopped working with H.H.S. last month.
Concerns piled up in summer 2021 at the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the H.H.S. division responsible for unaccompanied migrant children. In a memo that July, 11 managers said they were worried that labor trafficking was increasing and complained to their bosses that the office had become "one that rewards individuals for making quick releases, and not one that rewards individuals for preventing unsafe releases."
Staff members said in interviews that Mr. Becerra continued to push for faster results, often asking why they could not discharge children with machine-like efficiency.
"If Henry Ford had seen this in his plants, he would have never become famous and rich. This is not the way you do an assembly line," Mr. Becerra said at a staff meeting last summer, according to a recording obtained by The Times.
The H.H.S. spokeswoman, Ms. Jones, said that Mr. Becerra had urged his staff to "step it up." "Like any good leader, he wouldn't hesitate to do it again -- especially when it comes to the well-being and safety of children," she said.
During a call last March, Mr. Becerra told Cindy Huang, the O.R.R. director, that if she could not increase the number of discharges, he would find someone who could, according to five people familiar with the call. She resigned a month later.
He recently made a similar threat to her successor during a meeting with senior leadership, according to several people who were present.
'It Was All Lies'
While many migrant children are sent to the United States by their parents, others are persuaded to come by adults who plan to profit from their labor.
Nery Cutzal was 13 when he met his sponsor over Facebook Messenger. Once Nery arrived in Florida, he discovered that he owed more than $ 4,000 and had to find his own place to live. His sponsor sent him threatening text messages and kept a running list of new debts: $ 140 for filling out H.H.S. paperwork; $ 240 for clothes from Walmart; $ 45 for a taco dinner.
"Don't mess with me," the sponsor wrote. "You don't mean anything to me."
Nery began working until 3 a.m. most nights at a trendy Mexican restaurant near Palm Beach to make the payments. "He said I would be able to go to school and he would take care of me, but it was all lies," Nery said.
His father, Leonel Cutzal, said the family had become destitute after a series of bad harvests and had no choice but to send their oldest son north from Guatemala.
"Even when he shares $ 50, it's a huge help," Mr. Cutzal said. "Otherwise, there are times we don't eat." Mr. Cutzal had not understood how much Nery would be made to work, he said. "I think he passed through some hard moments being up there so young."
Nery eventually contacted law enforcement, and his sponsor was found guilty last year of smuggling a child into the United States for financial gain. That outcome is rare: In the past decade, federal prosecutors have brought only about 30 cases involving forced labor of unaccompanied minors, according to a Times review of court databases.
Unlike the foster care system, in which all children get case management, H.H.S. provides this service to about a third of children who pass through its care, and usually for just four months. Tens of thousands of other children are sent to their sponsors with little but the phone number for a national hotline. From there, they are often on their own: There is no formal follow-up from any federal or local agencies to ensure that sponsors are not putting children to work illegally.
In Pennsylvania, one case worker told The Times he went to check on a child released to a man who had applied to sponsor 20 other minors. The boy had vanished. In Texas, another case worker said she had encountered a man who had been targeting poor families in Guatemala, promising to help them get rich if they sent their children across the border. He had sponsored 13 children.
"If you've been in this field for any amount of time, you know that there's what the sponsors agree to, and what they're actually doing," said Bernal Cruz Munoz, a caseworker supervisor in Oregon.
Calling the hotline is not a sure way to get support, either. Juanito Ferrer called for help after he was brought to Manassas, Va., at age 15 by an acquaintance who forced him to paint houses during the day and guard an apartment complex at night. His sponsor took his paychecks and watched him on security cameras as he slept on the basement floor.
Juanito said that when he called the hotline in 2019, the person on the other end just took a report. "I thought they'd send the police or someone to check, but they never did that," he said. "I thought they would come and inspect the house, at least." He eventually escaped.
Asked about the hotline, H.H.S. said operators passed reports onto law enforcement and other local agencies because the agency did not have the authority to remove children from homes.
The Times analyzed government data to identify places with high concentrations of children who had been released to people outside their immediate families -- a sign that they might have been expected to work. In northwest Grand Rapids, for instance, 93 percent of children have been released to adults who are not their parents.
H.H.S. does not track these clusters, but the trends are so pronounced that officials sometimes notice hot spots anyway.
Scott Lloyd, who led the resettlement office in the Trump administration, said he realized in 2018 that the number of unaccompanied Guatemalan boys being released to sponsors in South Florida seemed to be growing.
"I always wondered what was happening there," he said.
But his attention was diverted by the chaos around the Trump administration's child separation policy, and he never looked into it. The trend he saw has only accelerated: For example, in the past three years, more than 200 children have been released to distant relatives or unrelated adults around Immokalee, Fla., an agricultural hub with a long history of labor exploitation.
In a statement, H.H.S. said it had updated its case management system to better flag instances when multiple children were being released to the same person or address.
Many sponsors see themselves as benevolent, doing a friend or neighbor a favor by agreeing to help a child get out of a government shelter, even if they do not intend to offer any support. Children often understand that they will have to work, but do not grasp the unrelenting grind that awaits them.
"I didn't get how expensive everything was," said 13-year-old Jose Vasquez, who works 12-hour shifts, six days a week, at a commercial egg farm in Michigan and lives with his teenage sister. "I'd like to go to school, but then how would I pay rent?"
Occupational Hazards
One fall morning at Union High School in Grand Rapids, Carolina listened to Mr. Angstman lecture on the journalist Jacob Riis and the Progressive Era movement that helped create federal child labor laws. He explained that the changes were meant to keep young people out of jobs that could harm their health or safety, and showed the class a photo of a small boy making cigars.
"Riis reported that members of this family worked 17 hours a day, seven days a week," he told the students. "The cramped space reeked of toxic fumes." Students seemed unmoved. Some struggled to stay awake.
Teachers at the school estimated that 200 of their immigrant students were working full time while trying to keep up with their classes. The greatest share of Mr. Angstman's students worked at one of the four Hearthside plants in the city.
The company, which has 39 factories in the United States, has been cited by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for 34 violations since 2019, including for unsafe conveyor belts at the plant where Carolina found her job. At least 11 workers suffered amputations in that time. In 2015, a machine caught the hairnet of an Ohio worker and ripped off part of her scalp.
The history of accidents "shows a corporate culture that lacks urgency to keep workers safe," an OSHA official wrote after the most recent violation for an amputation.
Underage workers in Grand Rapids said that spicy dust from immense batches of Flamin' Hot Cheetos made their lungs sting, and that moving heavy pallets of cereal all night made their backs ache. They worried about their hands getting caught in conveyor belts, which federal law classifies as so hazardous that no child Carolina's age is permitted to work with them.
Hearthside said in a statement that it was committed to complying with laws governing worker protections. "We strongly dispute the safety allegations made and are proud of our safety-first culture," the statement read.
Federal law bars minors from a long list of dangerous jobs, including roofing, meat processing and commercial baking. Except on farms, children younger than 16 are not supposed to work for more than three hours or after 7 p.m. on school days.
But these jobs -- which are grueling and poorly paid, and thus chronically short-staffed -- are exactly where many migrant children are ending up. Adolescents are twice as likely as adults to be seriously injured at work, yet recently arrived preteens and teenagers are running industrial dough mixers, driving massive earthmovers and burning their hands on hot tar as they lay down roofing shingles, The Times found.
Unaccompanied minors have had their legs torn off in factories and their spines shattered on construction sites, but most of these injuries go uncounted. The Labor Department tracks the deaths of foreign-born child workers but no longer makes them public. Reviewing state and federal safety records and public reports, The Times found a dozen cases of young migrant workers killed since 2017, the last year the Labor Department reported any.
The deaths include a 14-year-old food delivery worker who was hit by a car while on his bike at a Brooklyn intersection; a 16-year-old who was crushed under a 35-ton tractor-scraper outside Atlanta; and a 15-year-old who fell 50 feet from a roof in Alabama where he was laying down shingles.
In 2021, Karla Campbell, a Nashville labor lawyer, helped a woman figure out how to transport the body of her 14-year-old grandson, who had been killed on a landscaping job, back to his village in Guatemala. It was the second child labor death she had handled that year.
"I've been working on these cases for 15 years, and the addition of children is new," Ms. Campbell said.
In dairy production, the injury rate is twice the national average across all industries. Paco Calvo arrived in Middlebury, Vt., when he was 14 and has been working 12-hour days on dairy farms in the four years since. He said he crushed his hand in an industrial milking machine in the first months of doing this work.
"Pretty much everyone gets hurt when they first start," he said.
Targeting the Middlemen
Charlene Irizarry, the human resources manager at Farm Fresh Foods, an Alabama meat plant that struggles to retain staff, recently realized she was interviewing a 12-year-old for a job slicing chicken breasts into nuggets in a section of the factory kept at 40 degrees.
Ms. Irizarry regularly sees job applicants who use heavy makeup or medical masks to try to hide their youth, she said. "Sometimes their legs don't touch the floor."
Other times, an adult will apply for a job in the morning, and then a child using the same name will show up for orientation that afternoon. She and her staff have begun separating other young applicants from the adults who bring them in, so they will admit their real ages.
Ms. Irizarry said the plant had already been fined for one child labor violation, and she was trying to avoid another. But she wondered what the children might face if she turned them away.
"I worry about why they're so desperate for these jobs," she said.
In interviews with underage migrant workers, The Times found child labor in the American supply chains of many major brands and retailers. Several, including Ford, General Motors, J. Crew and Walmart, as well as their suppliers, said they took the allegations seriously and would investigate. Target and Whole Foods did not respond to requests for comment. Fruit of the Loom said it had ended its contract with the supplier.
One company, Ben & Jerry's, said it worked with labor groups to ensure a minimum set of working conditions at its dairy suppliers. Cheryl Pinto, the company's head of values-led sourcing, said that if migrant children needed to work full time, it was preferable for them to have jobs at a well-monitored workplace.
The Labor Department is supposed to find and punish child labor violations, but inspectors in a dozen states said their understaffed offices could barely respond to complaints, much less open original investigations. When the department has responded to tips on migrant children, it has focused on the outside contractors and staffing agencies that usually employ them, not the corporations where they perform the work.
In Worthington, Minn., it had long been an open secret that migrant children released by H.H.S. were cleaning a slaughterhouse run by JBS, the world's largest meat processor. The town has received more unaccompanied migrant children per capita than almost anywhere in the country.
Outside the JBS pork plant last fall, The Times spoke with baby-faced workers who chased and teased one another as they came off their shifts in the morning. Many had scratched their assumed names off company badges to hide evidence that they were working under false identities. Some said they had suffered chemical burns from the corrosive cleaners they used.
Not long afterward, labor inspectors responding to a tip found 22 Spanish-speaking children working for the company hired to clean the JBS plant in Worthington, and dozens more in the same job at meat-processing plants around the United States.
But the Labor Department can generally only issue fines. The cleaning company paid a $ 1.5 million penalty, while JBS said it had been unaware that children were scouring the Worthington factory each night. JBS fired the cleaning contractor.
Many of the children who were working there have found new jobs at other plants, The Times found.
"I still have to pay back my debt, so I still have to work," said Mauricio Ramirez, 17, who has found a meat processing job in the next town over.
'Not What I Imagined'
It has been a little more than a year since Carolina left Guatemala, and she has started to make some friends. She and another girl who works at Hearthside have necklaces that fit together, each strung with half a heart. When she has time, she posts selfies online decorated with smiley faces and flowers.
Mostly, though, she keeps to herself. Her teachers do not know many details about her journey to the border. When the topic came up at school recently, Carolina began sobbing and would not say why.
After a week of 17-hour days, she sat at home one night with her aunt and considered her life in the United States. The long nights. The stress about money. "I didn't have expectations about what life would be like here," she said, "but it's not what I imagined."
She was holding a debit card given to her by a staffing agency, which paid her Hearthside salary this way so she did not have to cash checks. Carolina turned it over and over in her palm as her aunt looked on.
"I know you get sad," Ms. Ramirez said.
Carolina looked down. She wanted to continue going to school to learn English, but she woke up most mornings with a clenched stomach and kept staying home sick. Some of her ninth grade classmates had already dropped out. The 16-year-old boy she sat next to in math class, Cristian Lopez, had left school to work overtime at Hearthside.
Cristian lived a few minutes away, in a bare two-room apartment he shared with his uncle and 12-year-old sister, Jennifer.
His sister did not go to school either, and they had spent the day bickering in their room. Now night had fallen and they were eating Froot Loops for dinner. The heat was off, so they wore winter jackets. In an interview from Guatemala, their mother, Isabel Lopez, cried as she explained that she had tried to join her children in the United States last year but was turned back at the border.
Cristian had given his uncle some of the money he earned making Chewy bars, but his uncle believed it was not enough. He had said he would like Jennifer to start working at the factory as well, and offered to take her to apply himself.
Cristian said he had recently called the H.H.S. hotline. He hoped the government would send someone to check on him and his sister, but he had not heard back. He did not think he would call again.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Times was honored for its coverage of the war in Ukraine and a photo of war victims, as well as for its reporting on private schools for Hasidic Jews in New York.
The New York Times won three George Polk Awards, two for its coverage of the war in Ukraine and one for an investigation into Hasidic Jewish schools in New York that denied students a basic education.
On Monday, Long Island University, which has run the prestigious Polk Awards for journalism since 1949, announced winners in 15 categories chosen from 515 submissions. A special award went to the youngest ever recipient of a Polk.
"Interestingly, a lot of reporters went after large, thematic stories, like the role of private equity companies in buying up hospitals, private homes and apartment complexes," John Darnton, the curator of the awards, said in a statement. "And the war in Ukraine produced superb war reporting, done at great peril."
The Times won the prize for foreign reporting. That submission included daily reporting on the war in Ukraine as well as a feature by Roger Cohen on President Vladimir V. Putin's "22-year slide from statesman to tyrant" in Russia. The Times's submission also included "Putin's War," a 13,000-word, two-month investigation that exposed Russia's powerful military as unprepared, ill-equipped and badly managed.
The Times also won the education reporting award for work by Eliza Shapiro and Brian M. Rosenthal that exposed how private schools in New York's Hasidic Jewish community were failing to provide students with an adequate education, despite receiving more than a quarter of a billion dollars in public funds annually.
Lynsey Addario of The Times won the photojournalism award for a photo that captured the horror in Ukraine. In the photo, the bodies of a Ukrainian mother, her two children and a family friend lay on the ground after they were killed by Russian mortar fire while trying to flee Ukraine. The citation for the award noted that Ms. Addario "dove for cover as the shell landed and then took the gruesome photo on instinct."
The award for war reporting was given to Mstyslav Chernov, Evgeniy Maloletka, Vasilisa Stepanenko and Lori Hinnant of The Associated Press. The A.P. was the last remaining Western news organization in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol after it came under fire from Russia, and the team of journalists documented the siege for almost three weeks before escaping.
The national reporting award went to Josh Gerstein, Alex Ward, Peter Canellos and the staff of Politico for their stunning scoop on a rare leak from the Supreme Court: a draft of the ruling that would overturn Roe v. Wade, upending the constitutional right to abortion after nearly 50 years. The official decision from the court came less than two months later. Politico continued its reporting with articles that examined the court's conservative majority and its hunt for the leaker of the draft.
John Archibald, Ashley Remkus and Ramsey Archibald of the news website AL.com won the prize for local reporting for an investigation into how the police force of the tiny town of Brookside, Ala., preyed on poorer residents with an aggressive increase in traffic citations and vehicle seizures, resulting in 640 percent growth in the town's revenues over two years.
The Reuters series "Undocumented and Underage," by Joshua Schneyer, Mica Rosenberg and Kristina Cooke, which also focused on Alabama, won for state reporting. The Reuters team revealed the widespread use of migrant children for illegal labor at factories that supply auto parts to Hyundai and Kia, as well as at chicken plants.
The health reporting award went to Kendall Taggart, John Templon, Anthony Cormier and Jason Leopold of BuzzFeed News for their investigation into the dire conditions at a chain of group homes for people with disabilities after it was bought by KKR, a private equity firm.
Ian Allison and Tracy Wang from the online cryptocurrency publication CoinDesk won the financial reporting honor for their work in exposing problems in the relationship between Sam Bankman-Fried's cryptocurrency exchange FTX and his trading firm, Alameda Research. The article set in motion the rapid implosion of both firms, and days later, FTX filed for bankruptcy. FTX customers and traders have lost billions of dollars, and Mr. Bankman-Fried is facing federal fraud charges.
A six-part series, "The Amazon, Undone," by Terrence McCoy of The Washington Post, won the environmental reporting prize. It illuminated the ways in which Brazil has failed to protect the rainforest, pushing it to the brink of destruction.
The justice reporting award went to Brett Murphy of ProPublica for his investigation into the pseudoscience of "911 call analysis," which claims to assess a caller's guilt based on speech patterns. His articles pointed to more than 100 cases in 26 states where the technique was used in criminal cases.
The prize for political reporting went to Sarah Blaskey, Nicholas Nehamas, Ana Ceballos, Mary Ellen Klas and the staff of the Miami Herald for their articles examining how refugees were lured under false pretenses onto flights from Texas to Martha's Vineyard, off the coast of Massachusetts, under the direction of Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida.

The New York Times won three George Polk Awards, two for its coverage of the war in Ukraine and one for an investigation into Hasidic Jewish schools in New York that denied students a basic education.
On Monday, Long Island University, which has run the prestigious Polk Awards for journalism since 1949, announced winners in 15 categories chosen from 515 submissions. A special award went to the youngest-ever recipient of a Polk.
“Interestingly, a lot of reporters went after large, thematic stories, like the role of private equity companies in buying up hospitals, private homes and apartment complexes,” John Darnton, the curator of the awards, said in a statement. “And the war in Ukraine produced superb war reporting, done at great peril.”
The Times won the prize for foreign reporting. That submission included daily reporting on the war in Ukraine as well as a feature by Roger Cohen on President Vladimir Putin’s “22-year slide from statesman to tyrant” in Russia. The Times’ submission also included “Putin’s War,” a 13,000-word, two-month investigation that exposed Russia’s powerful military as unprepared, ill-equipped and badly managed.
The Times also won the education reporting award for work by Eliza Shapiro and Brian M. Rosenthal that exposed how private schools in New York’s Hasidic Jewish community were failing to provide students with an adequate education, despite receiving more than $250 million in public funds annually.
Lynsey Addario of The Times won the photojournalism award for a photo that captured the horror in Ukraine. In the photo, the bodies of a Ukrainian mother, her two children and a family friend lay on the ground after they were killed by Russian mortar fire while trying to flee Ukraine. The citation for the award noted that Addario “dove for cover as the shell landed and then took the gruesome photo on instinct.”
The award for war reporting was given to Mstyslav Chernov, Evgeniy Maloletka, Vasilisa Stepanenko and Lori Hinnant of The Associated Press. The AP was the last remaining Western news organization in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol after it came under fire from Russia, and the team of journalists documented the siege for almost three weeks before escaping.
The national reporting award went to Josh Gerstein, Alex Ward, Peter Canellos and the staff of Politico for their scoop on a rare leak from the Supreme Court: a draft of the ruling that would overturn Roe v. Wade, upending the constitutional right to abortion after nearly 50 years. The official decision from the court came less than two months later. Politico continued its reporting with articles that examined the court’s conservative majority and its hunt for the leaker of the draft.
John Archibald, Ashley Remkus and Ramsey Archibald of the news website AL.com won the prize for local reporting for an investigation into how the police force of the tiny town of Brookside, Alabama, preyed on poorer residents with an aggressive increase in traffic citations and vehicle seizures, resulting in 640% growth in the town’s revenues over two years.
The Reuters series “Undocumented and Underage,” by Joshua Schneyer, Mica Rosenberg and Kristina Cooke, which also focused on Alabama, won for state reporting. The Reuters team revealed the widespread use of migrant children for illegal labor at factories that supply auto parts to Hyundai and Kia, as well as at chicken plants.
The health reporting award went to Kendall Taggart, John Templon, Anthony Cormier and Jason Leopold of BuzzFeed News for their investigation into the dire conditions at a chain of group homes for people with disabilities after it was bought by KKR, a private equity firm.
Ian Allison and Tracy Wang from the online cryptocurrency publication CoinDesk won the financial reporting honor for their work in exposing problems in the relationship between Sam Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency exchange FTX and his trading firm, Alameda Research. The article set in motion the rapid implosion of both firms, and days later, FTX filed for bankruptcy. FTX customers and traders have lost billions of dollars, and Bankman-Fried is facing federal fraud charges.
A six-part series, “The Amazon, Undone,” by Terrence McCoy of The Washington Post, won the environmental reporting prize. It illuminated the ways in which Brazil has failed to protect the rainforest, pushing it to the brink of destruction.
The justice reporting award went to Brett Murphy of ProPublica for his investigation into the pseudoscience of “911 call analysis,” which claims to assess a caller’s guilt based on speech patterns. His articles pointed to more than 100 cases in 26 states where the technique was used in criminal cases.
The prize for political reporting went to Sarah Blaskey, Nicholas Nehamas, Ana Ceballos, Mary Ellen Klas and the staff of the Miami Herald for their articles examining how refugees were lured under false pretenses onto flights from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard, off the coast of Massachusetts, under the direction of Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida.
The foreign television award went to Sharif Abdel Kouddous, Kavitha Chekuru and Laila Al-Arian for “The Killing of Shireen Abu Akleh,” a segment on Al-Jazeera English’s Fault Lines program. The team examined the shooting death by the Israeli military of Abu Akleh, a Palestinian-American journalist who was reporting in the West Bank.
Shimon Prokupecz, a senior crime and justice correspondent for CNN, and his crew were honored for national television reporting for their coverage of the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, that claimed the lives of 19 children and two teachers, and of law enforcement’s delay in challenging the gunman.

The university is now investigating the allegations. Baker, 18, is the son of two journalists — Peter Baker of The New York Times and Susan B. Glasser of The New Yorker — and is the youngest recipient of a Polk Award, according to Darnton.
The Sydney H. Schanberg prize, which honors long-form investigative journalism, was awarded to Alex Perry, a freelance journalist who chronicled a 2021 Islamic State group attack in a remote town in Mozambique for Outside magazine. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Walmart Is Closing
3 Technology Hubs in U.S.
Walmart will close technology hubs in Texas, California and Oregon, and aim to relocate employees from there to other locations, including the company's headquarters in Bentonville, Ark.
"We've made the decision to focus our tech team's presence within select locations," Walmart said in an emailed statement on Tuesday. "We hope to relocate or allow for remote work for all affected associates."
Walmart had been expanding its tech hubs across the United States and Canada over the last few years. It also has hubs in India.
It was not immediately clear how many employees would be affected.
Walmart's digital business remains strong. In its most recent earnings, which it released in November, the retailer reported that e-commerce increased 1 percent from the previous year -- and 38 percent from 2020. The company will report fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday. JORDYN HOLMAN

Air India Agrees to Lease
A Record 470 Airliners
Air India unveiled deals on Tuesday for a record 470 jets from Airbus and Boeing, accelerating the rebirth of a national emblem under new owners Tata Group as Europe and the United States hailed deepening economic and political ties with New Delhi.
The provisional deals include 220 planes from Boeing and 250 from Airbus and eclipse previous records for a single airline as Air India vies with the domestic giant IndiGo to serve what will soon be the world's largest population.
President Biden called the agreement "historic."
Boeing will supply 190 737 MAX, 20 of its 787 Dreamliners and 10 mini-jumbo 777X.
Together with another 25 Airbus jets to be leased to meet immediate needs, the overall acquisition reaches 495 jets, an Airbus executive said.
The airline's renaissance under the Tata conglomerate aims to capitalize on India's growing base of fliers and large diaspora across the world. REUTERS

A TikTok Challenge
Snares Hyundai and Kia
Hyundai and Kia are rolling out software updates to stem a raft of auto thefts related to a TikTok challenge that authorities believe has led to at least 14 reported crashes and eight fatalities.
The updates are free for millions of vehicles that are missing a key anti-theft device, an issue that was exploited on social media and led to rampant theft of the cars.
The software being released updates the theft alarm software logic to extend the length of the alarm sound from 30 seconds to one minute and requires the key to be in the ignition switch to turn the vehicle on.
About 3.8 million Hyundais and 4.5 million Kias are eligible for the software update, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Tuesday.
Hyundai said updates began Tuesday for nearly 4 million vehicles beginning with a million model year 2017-2020 Elantra, 2015-2019 Sonata and 2020-2021 Venue vehicles; remaining eligible vehicles will update by June. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Electric Vehicle Prices Are Closing In on Gas Cars: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Competition, government incentives and falling raw material prices are making battery-powered cars more affordable sooner than expected.
More quickly than seemed possible a few months ago, sticker prices for electric vehicles are falling closer to the point where they could soon be on a par with gasoline cars.
Increased competition, government incentives and falling prices for lithium and other battery materials are making electric vehicles noticeably more affordable. The tipping point when electric vehicles become as cheap as or cheaper than cars with internal combustion engines could arrive this year for some mass market models and is already the case for some luxury vehicles.
Prices are likely to continue trending lower as Tesla, General Motors, Ford Motor and their battery suppliers ramp up new factories, reaping the cost savings that come from mass production. New electric vehicles from companies like Volkswagen, Nissan and Hyundai will add to competitive pressure.
The battery-powered version of G.M.'s Equinox crossover, for example, will start around $ 30,000 when it arrives this fall, the carmaker has said. That is $ 3,400 more than the least expensive gasoline-fueled Equinox. But factoring in government incentives, the electric Equinox should be cheaper. Like all electric vehicles, the car will need less maintenance, and the electricity to power it will cost less than the gasoline used by its combustion engine equivalent.
Only a few months ago, electric vehicle buyers faced long waiting lists, and dealers marked up sticker prices by thousands of dollars. Used electric vehicles sometimes sold for more than new ones because buyers were willing to pay a premium to get one right away. At the end of 2022, the average price of an electric vehicle was $ 61,488, compared with $ 49,507 for all passenger cars and trucks, according to Kelley Blue Book.
There are still waiting lists for some models like the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck, but it has become easier and cheaper to find and buy new and used electric models.
The first major crack in the trend of rising prices came in January when Tesla cut prices for the Model 3 and Model Y, the two best-selling electric cars, by thousands of dollars. With a starting price of $ 43,500 before government incentives, a Model 3 is now $ 300 less than the least expensive BMW 3 Series sedan. A Model Y, at $ 55,000 before tax credits, costs about as much as a comparable Lexus RX.
Ford also cut the price of its Mustang Mach-E, the best-selling electric vehicle in the United States after the Teslas. Even Lucid Motors, a maker of expensive electric sedans that do not qualify for tax credits, is feeling pressure to cut prices and this week began offering $ 7,500 discounts on cars that start at $ 107,400.
Tesla "saw there is increasing competition and some of the competition is quite good," said Brian Moody, executive editor for Kelley Blue Book. He added, "If the No. 1 seller of a certain type of car reduces their prices, that is going to have an impact on the average."
Major impetus for the price cuts came from the Inflation Reduction Act, legislation passed by Democrats in Congress last year that provides tax credits of up to $ 7,500 for electric car buyers. To qualify, battery-powered or plug-in hybrid sedans have to sell for less than $ 55,000, while pickups and sport utility vehicles qualify only if the retail price is below $ 80,000. By cutting prices, Ford and Tesla increased the number of models that could benefit from the tax credits.
Manufacturers "are working to continue to pull in shoppers by making these vehicles eligible for tax credits," said Jenni Newman, editor in chief of Cars.com, an online auto sales site.
Potentially more significant are subsidies paid to companies that manufacture batteries in the United States, part of a drive by the Biden administration to establish a domestic supply chain and reduce dependence on China.
The subsidies, which were also part of the Inflation Reduction Act, could cut the cost of making electric vehicles by as much as $ 9,000. That break and the tax credits for buyers of electric cars could allow battery-powered vehicles to achieve price parity with gasoline cars as soon as this year, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research and advocacy group. That is three to five years sooner than would be the case without incentives.
"If the automakers pass that on to consumers, consumers will really benefit," said Stephanie Searle, a program director at the council who oversees research on passenger vehicles.
Declines in new car prices are pushing down used electric vehicle prices, too. They have fallen 17 percent since July, according to Recurrent, which tracks the used car market. That's largely because Tesla cut the price of the Model 3 and G.M. lowered the price of the Chevrolet Bolt by almost $ 6,000 last year. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, used cars can also qualify for a tax credit of up to $ 4,000. That is important because most people buy used vehicles.
Falling prices for materials like lithium and cobalt have also helped. The price of lithium used in batteries has fallen 20 percent from its peak in November, though the metal still costs more than twice as much as it did at the end of 2021. Cobalt has fallen by more than half since May, in part because carmakers are selling some models that do not require it, reducing demand.
New lithium mines are beginning to produce ore, which could keep a lid on prices. Sigma Lithium will begin shipping raw material from a site in Brazil to LG Energy Solution, its main customer, as early as April, Ana Cabral Gardner, Sigma Lithium's chief executive, said in an interview. The site will be the first new source of lithium in Latin America for several years.
"It's doable, and we're there," Ms. Cabral Gardner said.
Of course, these advantages could fade because of new supply chain problems. Lithium remains in short supply, and prices could spike again. Beginning next month, new regulations governing the $ 7,500 tax credits will require electric car batteries to be made in the United States, Canada or Mexico with raw materials from North America or another U.S. trade ally. It is unclear how many vehicles will meet those requirements.
Right now, the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits are available to vehicles assembled in North America, which partly shields the U.S. automakers from competitors like Hyundai. The company's Ioniq 5 has sold well, but it is imported from South Korea. Hyundai is building a factory in Georgia that will start assembling electric vehicles in 2025. (Buyers may still collect a tax credit indirectly if they lease foreign-made electric vehicles.)
The Treasury Department, which is responsible for carrying out the Inflation Reduction Act, gave in to auto industry lobbying this month and classified several popular crossovers as S.U.V.s rather than sedans. That allows vehicles like the Mustang Mach-E and all versions of the Model Y to qualify for tax credits if they sell for $ 80,000 or less. Before that change, the Mustang and lighter versions of the Model Y were classified as sedans, subject to the $ 55,000 limit.
The decision removes some pressure on the carmakers to keep prices low. Tesla quickly raised the price of the Model Y by $ 2,000. Ford said it had no plans to raise prices of the Mach-E.
The Inflation Reduction Act is also under attack by many congressional Republicans even though automakers and battery companies are building factories in states, like South Carolina, Texas and Tennessee, where voters tend to elect Republicans.
But arguably the most powerful force driving down prices is not the commodity markets or Washington.
As electric vehicle sales soar -- rising 66 percent in the United States last year to 810,000, according to Kelley Blue Book -- automakers are getting better at making them. Ford has reduced the weight of the Mach-E by 70 pounds, increasing range and lowering cost, by eliminating some wiring, Jim Farley, the company's chief executive, told investors this month.
General Motors and LG Energy Solution began producing batteries at a new plant in Ohio last year through a joint venture, Ultium Cells. A second Ultium plant, in Tennessee, is expected to begin production this year, and a third is slated for Michigan. Generally speaking, costs come down as companies produce more of a product.
Auto executives say they are finding it is easier and cheaper to design and build new electric models than gasoline-powered ones.
The battery cells made by Ultium, for example, are part of a collection of components that can be mixed and matched in many types of vehicles. Carmakers have long used the same platforms in multiple models, but the strategy works even better with electric vehicles because the cars have far fewer parts than internal combustion vehicles.
The Ultium platform cuts the time needed to develop a new vehicle by almost two years, Dan Nicholson, vice president of electrification at G.M., said at a Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago conference in January.
As a result, G.M. will be able to introduce three Chevrolet electric vehicles this year: the Equinox, a Silverado pickup truck and a Blazer S.U.V. "That's how we get the economies of scale," Mr. Nicholson said.
Suppliers have been looking for efficiencies, too. Matthews International, based in Pittsburgh, has developed a process for coating the metal foil that separates the positive and negative electrodes of a battery. Instead of a liquid solution, the process uses a powder.
The process requires less equipment and a lot less space, said Greg Babe, the company's chief technology officer. Those kinds of incremental improvements reduce costs without major technical breakthroughs.
Interest in the approach developed by Matthews has soared since President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act. "It changed almost overnight," Mr. Babe said. "The floodgates opened."

Ford also cut the price of its Mustang Mach-E, the bestselling electric vehicle in the United States after the Teslas. Even Lucid Motors, a maker of expensive electric sedans that do not qualify for tax credits, is feeling pressure to cut prices and last week began offering $7,500 discounts on cars that start at $107,400.
Tesla “saw there is increasing competition, and some of the competition is quite good,” said Brian Moody, executive editor for Kelley Blue Book. He added, “If the No. 1 seller of a certain type of car reduces their prices, that is going to have an impact on the average.”
Major impetus for the price cuts came from the Inflation Reduction Act, legislation passed by Democrats in Congress last year that provides tax credits of up to $7,500 for electric-car buyers. To qualify, battery-powered or plug-in hybrid sedans have to sell for less than $55,000, while pickups and sport utility vehicles qualify only if the retail price is below $80,000. By cutting prices, Ford and Tesla increased the number of models that could benefit from the tax credits.
Manufacturers “are working to continue to pull in shoppers by making these vehicles eligible for tax credits,” said Jenni Newman, editor-in-chief of Cars.com, an online auto-sales site.
Potentially more significant are subsidies paid to companies that manufacture batteries in the United States, part of a drive by the Biden administration to establish a domestic supply chain and reduce dependence on China.
The subsidies, which were also part of the Inflation Reduction Act, could cut the cost of making electric vehicles by as much as $9,000. That break and the tax credits for buyers of electric cars could allow battery-powered vehicles to achieve price parity with gasoline cars as soon as this year, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research and advocacy group. That is three to five years sooner than would be the case without incentives.
“If the automakers pass that on to consumers, consumers will really benefit,” said Stephanie Searle, a program director at the council who oversees research on passenger vehicles.
Declines in new-car prices are pushing down used electric-vehicle prices, too. They have fallen 17% since July, according to Recurrent, which tracks the used-car market. That’s largely because Tesla cut the price of the Model 3 and GM lowered the price of the Chevrolet Bolt by almost $6,000 last year. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, used cars can also qualify for a tax credit of up to $4,000. That is important because most people buy used vehicles.
Falling prices for materials like lithium and cobalt have also helped. The price of lithium used in batteries has fallen 20% from its peak in November, though the metal still costs more than twice as much as it did at the end of 2021. Cobalt has fallen by more than half since May, in part because carmakers are selling some models that do not require it, reducing demand.
New lithium mines are beginning to produce ore, which could keep a lid on prices. Sigma Lithium will begin shipping raw material from a site in Brazil to LG Energy Solution, its main customer, as early as April, Ana Cabral Gardner, Sigma Lithium’s chief executive, said in an interview. The site will be the first new source of lithium in Latin America for several years. “It’s doable, and we’re there,” Cabral Gardner said.
Of course, these advantages could fade because of new supply-chain problems. Lithium remains in short supply, and prices could spike again. Beginning next month, new regulations governing the $7,500 tax credits will require electric-car batteries to be made in the United States, Canada or Mexico with raw materials from North America or another U.S. trade ally. It is unclear how many vehicles will meet those requirements.
Right now, the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits are available to vehicles assembled in North America, which partially shields the U.S. automakers from competitors like Hyundai. The company’s Ioniq 5 has sold well, but it is imported from South Korea. Hyundai is building a factory in Georgia that will start assembling electric vehicles in 2025. (Buyers may still collect a tax credit indirectly if they lease foreign-made electric vehicles.)
The Treasury Department, which is responsible for carrying out the Inflation Reduction Act, gave in to auto industry lobbying this month and classified several popular crossovers as SUVs rather than sedans. That allows vehicles like the Mustang Mach-E and all versions of the Model Y to qualify for tax credits if they sell for $80,000 or less. Before that change, the Mustang and lighter versions of the Model Y were classified as sedans, subject to a $55,000 limit.
The decision removes some pressure on the carmakers to keep prices low. Tesla quickly raised the price of the Model Y by $2,000. Ford said it had no plans to raise prices of the Mach-E.
The Inflation Reduction Act is also under attack by many congressional Republicans even though automakers and battery companies are building factories in states like South Carolina, Texas and Tennessee, where voters tend to elect Republicans.
But arguably the most powerful force driving down prices is not the commodity markets or Washington.
As electric-vehicle sales soar — rising 66% in the United States last year to 810,000, according to Kelley Blue Book — automakers are getting better at making them. Ford has reduced the weight of the Mach-E by 70 pounds, increasing range and lowering cost, by eliminating some wiring, Jim Farley, the company’s chief executive, told investors this month.
GM and LG Energy Solution began producing batteries at a new plant in Ohio last year through a joint venture, Ultium Cells. A second Ultium plant, in Tennessee, is expected to begin production this year, and a third is slated for Michigan. Generally speaking, costs come down as companies produce more of a product.
Auto executives say that they are finding it is easier and cheaper to design and build new electric models than gasoline-powered ones.
The battery cells made by Ultium, for example, are part of a collection of components that can be mixed and matched in many types of vehicles. Carmakers have long used the same platforms in multiple models, but the strategy works even better with electric vehicles because the cars have far fewer parts than internal combustion vehicles.
The Ultium platform cuts the time needed to develop a new vehicle by almost two years, Dan Nicholson, vice president of electrification at GM, said at a Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago conference in January.
As a result, GM will be able to introduce three Chevrolet electric vehicles this year: the Equinox, a Silverado pickup truck and a Blazer SUV. “That’s how we get the economies of scale,” Nicholson said.
Suppliers have been looking for efficiencies, too. Matthews International, based in Pittsburgh, has developed a process for coating the metal foil that separates the positive and negative electrodes of a battery. Instead of a liquid solution, the process uses a powder.
The process requires less equipment and a lot less space, said Greg Babe, the company’s chief technology officer. Those kinds of incremental improvements reduce costs without major technical breakthroughs.
Interest in the approach developed by Matthews has soared since Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act. “It changed almost overnight,” Babe said. “The floodgates opened.”

More quickly than seemed possible a few months ago, sticker prices for electric vehicles are falling closer to the point at which they could soon be on a par with gasoline cars.
Increased competition, government incentives and falling prices for lithium and other battery materials are making electric vehicles noticeably more affordable. The tipping point when electric vehicles become as cheap or cheaper than cars with internal combustion engines could arrive this year for some mass market models and is already the case for some luxury vehicles.
Prices are likely to continue trending lower as Tesla, General Motors, Ford Motor and their battery suppliers ramp up new factories, reaping the cost savings that come from mass production. New electric vehicles from companies like Volkswagen, Nissan and Hyundai will add to competitive pressure.
The battery-powered version of GM’s Equinox crossover, for example, will start around $30,000 when it arrives this fall, the carmaker has said. That is $3,400 more than the least expensive gasoline-fueled Equinox. But factoring in government incentives, the electric Equinox should be cheaper. Like all electric vehicles, the car will need less maintenance, and the electricity to power it will cost less than the gasoline used by its combustion engine equivalent.
Only a few months ago, electric-vehicle buyers faced long waiting lists, and dealers marked up sticker prices by thousands of dollars. Used electric vehicles sometimes sold for more than new ones because buyers were willing to pay a premium to get one right away. At the end of 2022, the average price of an electric vehicle was $61,488, compared with $49,507 for all passenger cars and trucks, according to Kelley Blue Book.
There are still waiting lists for some models like the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck, but it has become easier and cheaper to find and buy new and used electric models.
The first major crack in the trend of rising prices came in January, when Tesla cut prices for the Model 3 and Model Y, the two bestselling electric cars, by thousands of dollars. With a starting price of $43,500 before government incentives, a Model 3 is now $300 less than the least expensive BMW 3 Series sedan. A Model Y, at $55,000 before tax credits, costs about as much as a comparable Lexus RX.
Ford also cut the price of its Mustang Mach-E, the bestselling electric vehicle in the United States after the Teslas. Even Lucid Motors, a maker of expensive electric sedans that do not qualify for tax credits, is feeling pressure to cut prices and this week began offering $7,500 discounts on cars that start at $107,400.
Tesla “saw there is increasing competition, and some of the competition is quite good,” said Brian Moody, executive editor for Kelley Blue Book. He added, “If the No. 1 seller of a certain type of car reduces their prices, that is going to have an impact on the average.”

By cutting prices, Ford and Tesla increased the number of models that could benefit from the tax credits.
Manufacturers “are working to continue to pull in shoppers by making these vehicles eligible for tax credits,” said Jenni Newman, editor-in-chief of Cars.com, an online auto-sales site.
Potentially more significant are subsidies paid to companies that manufacture batteries in the United States, part of a drive by the Biden administration to establish a domestic supply chain and reduce dependence on China.

Tesla's Stainless Steel Pickup Truck Is Coming Soon. Maybe.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Already two years behind schedule, the Cybertruck has experts wondering how the company will manufacture its unusual stainless steel "exoskeleton."
More than three years after Elon Musk stunned the auto industry with an electric pickup truck that looked more like a stealth fighter than a way to haul two-by-fours and drywall, Tesla said last month that it would begin building the vehicle by the end of 2023.
The announcement has helped fuel a recovery in Tesla's share price, but also revived a debate about whether the often-delayed pickup, called the Cybertruck, is a work of genius or evidence of Mr. Musk's hubris.
It would be very unlike Mr. Musk, Tesla's chief executive, to build a pickup that looked anything like the Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado or Ram 1500 pickup -- three of the best-selling vehicles in the United States.
With its angular stainless steel body, the Cybertruck is an attempt to redefine the pickup in the same way that Tesla upended the conventional wisdom of the auto industry by proving that battery-powered vehicles could be practical and profitable.
Tesla advertises that a top-of-the-line version of the truck will be able to tow 14,000 pounds and accelerate faster than a Porsche 911. The Cybertruck's doors will open automatically when the driver approaches.
The truck is important because it will be Tesla's first new passenger vehicle in three years and could help breathe life into a model lineup that some buyers consider dated. Established carmakers like Ford, General Motors and Hyundai have released several new electric models since the Model Y, Tesla's most recent car, went on sale in early 2020.
But the Cybertruck is so behind schedule that some auto experts wonder if it has become another example of Mr. Musk's penchant for pushing technological boundaries to the brink of disaster. In 2018, his determination to build a highly automated assembly line for the Model 3 sedan led to "production hell" and nearly killed the company before he opted for more standard manufacturing practices.
This time it's the use of stainless steel for the Cybertruck's body that has industry experts shaking their heads.
Stainless steel resists corrosion and doesn't need to be painted, eliminating a cost and the need for environmentally toxic chemical coatings. But it is also expensive and difficult to shape and weld. Stainless steel is typically heavier than the steel used in most other cars, reducing driving range.
There is a reason that only one car company has ever tried to mass-produce a car with a stainless steel body. That was DeLorean, which went bankrupt after building fewer than 10,000 cars, which are best known for their starring role as a time machine in the "Back to the Future" films.
"Musk is an example of how the fetishization of tech start-ups and their leaders can eventually lead those leaders to making bad decisions," Patrick McQuown, executive director of entrepreneurship at Towson University in Maryland, said in an email. "To me, the insistence on stainless steel is a manifestation of his belief that he has some unique understanding of the market, and that the market will buy whatever he offers because it comes from the mind of Elon Musk."
Stainless steel costs more than the steel used in most automobiles because it contains chromium and often other ingredients, like nickel and molybdenum, that are in high demand. Stainless steel's tendency to spring back to its original shape means it cannot be stamped into fenders and other parts as easily as the more pliable steel used by most automakers. It also requires special welding techniques.
These challenges probably help explain why Tesla is two years behind schedule in manufacturing the Cybertruck, which the company plans to produce at its factory in Austin, Texas.
"Tesla thinks they can solve any problem and don't have to learn from anyone else," said Raj Rajkumar, a professor of engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, "and then they get stuck in a corner."
Tesla said in an earnings report last month that it would begin producing the Cybertruck before the end of this year. But Mr. Musk qualified that statement during a conference call with analysts and investors, saying the company wouldn't begin making the vehicle in large numbers until 2024. When Tesla unveiled the Cybertruck, it said the vehicle would go on sale in 2021.
The vehicle "will not be a significant contributor to the bottom line" in 2023, Mr. Musk said, "but it will be next year."
Tesla's delays allowed traditional carmakers to beat it to market with electric pickups, and leave Tesla with nothing to offer the many Americans who prefer pickup trucks to cars or sport utility vehicles.
Buyers are clamoring for electric trucks. Ford stopped taking reservations for its F-150 Lightning, a battery-powered version of the best-selling vehicle, because it can't make the vehicles fast enough. Rivian, a newer electric vehicle company, is also struggling to produce enough of its pickup, the R1T, to meet demand.
G.M.'s GMC division is selling a Hummer pickup truck, but in relatively small numbers. And Chevrolet is expected to begin delivering an electric Silverado this year. Ram has said it will release a battery-powered 1500 truck next year.
"The first-mover advantage that Tesla could have leveraged has completely gone away," Mr. Rajkumar said. "It's a massive opportunity lost."
Tesla has shared virtually no details about how it will overcome the challenges of working with stainless steel, which include safety. The steel used in most cars is designed to crumple in a crash, absorbing energy and protecting passengers. Stainless steel does not crumple as easily, exposing passengers to more of the force from impact.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
There are indications that the truck will use a stainless steel formula that is the same as or similar to that used by SpaceX, the rocket company headed by Mr. Musk. Charles Kuehmann, vice president of materials engineering at SpaceX, holds the same title at Tesla.
Mr. Kuehmann was a co-founder of QuesTek, a materials design firm, and worked on a design team at Apple. His reputation as a pioneer in the use of new materials gives some engineering experts confidence that Tesla has developed an alloy that will overcome the challenges of stainless steel.
Mr. Kuehmann did not respond to a request for comment.
The Cybertruck body has none of the curves typical of most vehicles, instead consisting of flat steel panels that experts say are probably cut with lasers and then welded together, eliminating the need for powerful stamping machines.
"Broadly the concept could make sense," said Kip Findley, a professor of metallurgical and materials engineering at the Colorado School of Mines who has done research on advanced steel for vehicles. "This is pushing steel development forward and making people think about steel in a different way, which is good."
"But there are some open questions," Mr. Findley added. These include how owners will repair damage to the Cybertruck's body, which Tesla refers to as an "exoskeleton." Stainless steel dents less easily than conventional auto-body steel, but once damaged it is more difficult to pound back into shape.
As the only company mass-producing vehicle bodies from stainless steel, Tesla will not be able to take advantage of the economies of scale that other automakers share. That could make the truck more expensive to produce.
When Tesla introduced the Cybertruck, it said the starting price would be just under $ 40,000. But the final price is widely expected to be much higher.
Tesla is taking reservations, which cost $ 100, for the Cybertruck without naming a price for the vehicle. Tesla has not said how many reservations it has amassed.
If nothing else, the Cybertruck will stand out in a crowded field.
Stainless steel car bodies are "certainly possible," said Wei Xiong, an associate professor of metallurgy and materials design at the University of Pittsburgh, noting that computer-aided design allows researchers to develop high-performance materials much faster than a few years ago. "I can understand why he wants to go there."

More than three years after Elon Musk stunned the auto industry with an electric pickup truck that looked more like a stealth fighter than a way to haul two-by-fours and drywall, Tesla said last month that it would begin building the vehicle by the end of 2023.
The announcement has helped fuel a recovery in Tesla’s share price, but it also revived a debate about whether the often-delayed pickup, called the Cybertruck, is a work of genius or evidence of Musk’s hubris.
It would be very unlike Musk, Tesla’s CEO, to build a pickup that looked anything like the Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado or Ram 1500 pickup — three of the bestselling vehicles in the United States.
With its angular stainless steel body, the Cybertruck is an attempt to redefine the pickup in the same way that Tesla upended the conventional wisdom of the auto industry by proving that battery-powered vehicles could be practical and profitable.
Tesla advertises that a top-of-the-line version of the truck will be able to tow 14,000 pounds and accelerate faster than a Porsche 911. The Cybertruck’s doors will open automatically when the driver approaches.
The truck is important because it will be Tesla’s first new passenger vehicle in three years and could help breathe life into a model lineup that some buyers consider dated. Established carmakers like Ford, General Motors and Hyundai have released several new electric models since the Model Y, Tesla’s most recent car, went on sale in early 2020.
But the Cybertruck is so behind schedule that some auto experts wonder if it has become another example of Musk’s penchant for pushing technological boundaries to the brink of disaster. In 2018, his determination to build a highly automated assembly line for the Model 3 sedan led to “production hell” and nearly killed the company before he opted for more standard manufacturing practices.
This time it’s the use of stainless steel for the Cybertruck’s body that has industry experts shaking their heads.
Stainless steel resists corrosion and doesn’t need to be painted, eliminating a cost and the need for environmentally toxic chemical coatings. But it is also expensive and difficult to shape and weld. Stainless steel is typically heavier than the steel used in most other cars, reducing driving range.
There is a reason that only one car company has ever tried to mass-produce a car with a stainless steel body. That was DeLorean, which went bankrupt after building fewer than 10,000 cars, which are best known for their starring role as a time machine in the “Back to the Future” films.
“Musk is an example of how the fetishization of tech startups and their leaders can eventually lead those leaders to making bad decisions,” Patrick McQuown, executive director of entrepreneurship at Towson University in Maryland, said in an email. “To me, the insistence on stainless steel is a manifestation of his belief that he has some unique understanding of the market, and that the market will buy whatever he offers because it comes from the mind of Elon Musk.”
Stainless steel costs more than the steel used in most automobiles because it contains chromium and often other ingredients, like nickel and molybdenum, that are in high demand. Stainless steel’s tendency to spring back to its original shape means it cannot be stamped into fenders and other parts as easily as the more pliable steel used by most automakers. It also requires special welding techniques.
These challenges probably help explain why Tesla is two years behind schedule in manufacturing the Cybertruck, which the company plans to produce at its factory in Austin, Texas.
“Tesla thinks they can solve any problem and don’t have to learn from anyone else,” said Raj Rajkumar, a professor of engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, “and then they get stuck in a corner.”
Tesla said in an earnings report last month that it would begin producing the Cybertruck before the end of this year. But Musk qualified that statement during a conference call with analysts and investors, saying the company wouldn’t begin making the vehicle in large numbers until 2024. When Tesla unveiled the Cybertruck, it said the vehicle would go on sale in 2021.
The vehicle “will not be a significant contributor to the bottom line” in 2023, Musk said, “but it will be next year.”
Tesla’s delays allowed traditional carmakers to beat it to market with electric pickups, and leave Tesla with nothing to offer the many Americans who prefer pickup trucks to cars or SUVs.
Buyers are clamoring for electric trucks. Ford stopped taking reservations for its F-150 Lightning, a battery-powered version of the bestselling vehicle, because it can’t make the vehicles fast enough. Rivian, a newer electric vehicle company, is also struggling to produce enough of its pickup, the R1T, to meet demand.
GM’s GMC division is selling a Hummer pickup truck, but in relatively small numbers. And Chevrolet is expected to begin delivering an electric Silverado this year. Ram has said it will release a battery-powered 1500 truck next year.
“The first-mover advantage that Tesla could have leveraged has completely gone away,” Rajkumar said. “It’s a massive opportunity lost.”
Tesla has shared virtually no details about how it will overcome the challenges of working with stainless steel, which include safety. The steel used in most cars is designed to crumple in a crash, absorbing energy and protecting passengers. Stainless steel does not crumple as easily, exposing passengers to more of the force from impact.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
There are indications that the truck will use a stainless steel formula that is the same as or similar to that used by SpaceX, the rocket company headed by Musk. Charles Kuehmann, vice president of materials engineering at SpaceX, holds the same title at Tesla.
Kuehmann was a co-founder of QuesTek, a materials design firm, and worked on a design team at Apple. His reputation as a pioneer in the use of new materials gives some engineering experts confidence that Tesla has developed an alloy that will overcome the challenges of stainless steel.
Kuehmann did not respond to a request for comment.
The Cybertruck body has none of the curves typical of most vehicles, instead consisting of flat steel panels that experts say are probably cut with lasers and then welded together, eliminating the need for powerful stamping machines.
“Broadly the concept could make sense,” said Kip Findley, a professor of metallurgical and materials engineering at the Colorado School of Mines who has done research on advanced steel for vehicles. “This is pushing steel development forward and making people think about steel in a different way, which is good.”
“But there are some open questions,” Findley added. These include how owners will repair damage to the Cybertruck’s body, which Tesla refers to as an “exoskeleton.” Stainless steel dents less easily than conventional auto-body steel, but once damaged it is more difficult to pound back into shape.
As the only company mass-producing vehicle bodies from stainless steel, Tesla will not be able to take advantage of the economies of scale that other automakers share. That could make the truck more expensive to produce.
When Tesla introduced the Cybertruck, it said the starting price would be just under $40,000. But the final price is widely expected to be much higher.
Tesla is taking reservations, which cost $100, for the Cybertruck without naming a price for the vehicle. Tesla has not said how many reservations it has amassed.
If nothing else, the Cybertruck will stand out in a crowded field.
Stainless steel car bodies are “certainly possible,” said Wei Xiong, an associate professor of metallurgy and materials design at the University of Pittsburgh, noting that computer-aided design allows researchers to develop high-performance materials much faster than a few years ago. “I can understand why he wants to go there.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Ford Lost $2 Billion in '22 As Two Investments Soured: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company's financial performance was hurt by its stake in Rivian, an electric truck company, and an autonomous car business.
Ford Motor said on Thursday that it lost $ 2.2 billion in 2022 as it wrote down the value of two big investments and struggled with high costs and supply chain problems.
The company wrote down its investments in Rivian, a young electric truck maker, by $ 7.4 billion and Argo AI, a company developing autonomous vehicles, by $ 2.8 billion last year. Ford said on Thursday that it had almost completely sold its stake in Rivian. In October, Ford said Argo was winding down.
The automaker said its revenue had risen about 16 percent, to $ 158 billion, mainly because of higher car prices. The company sold 4.2 million vehicles worldwide, up from 3.9 million in 2021.
Ford has long struggled to reduce defects and recalls in its cars and trucks. Recalls can be expensive and time consuming, and company executives said on Thursday that they were working to improve the reliability of their vehicles.
"In simple terms, we need to improve quality and lower costs now," the company's chief financial officer, John Lawler, said in a conference call.
Ford's performance was also hurt by a $ 600 million loss stemming from its joint ventures in China and about $ 12 billion in special expenses, including those related to Argo and Rivian, which has lost much of its value since it listed on the stock exchange in November 2021.
Excluding the special expenses, interest and taxes, Ford made a $ 10.4 billion profit last year, it said, roughly as much as in 2021.
"We should have done much better last year," the company's chief executive, Jim Farley, said in a statement.
In the last three months of the year, Ford had a $ 1.3 billion profit, a steep drop from a year earlier, when it booked a large gain from its stake in Rivian. Ford's revenue in the final three months of 2022 rose 17 percent, to $ 44 billion.
The company sold 1.15 million vehicles in the fourth quarter, an increase from 1.1 million a year earlier but about 500,000 fewer than Ford had expected, Mr. Lawler said.
Ford's production has been slowed by the global shortage of computer chips, and Mr. Lawler said the company expected some disruptions to continue this year and a slight increase in production volume.
"In 2023, there is still going to be volatility on chips," he said. "On the older chips used in the auto industry, there is still capacity constraint."
Ford said it expected this year's adjusted earnings before interest and taxes to range between $ 9 billion and $ 11 billion.
Shares of Ford stock were down about 7 percent in extended trading on Thursday.
Earlier in the day, Ford said that its sales of cars and trucks in the United States increased 2 percent in January and that its sales of electric vehicles more than doubled in the month.
The automaker sold 145,070 cars and light trucks last month, up from 142,445 in January 2022, when a shortage of computer chips slowed production and left dealers with few vehicles to sell. At the end of January, Ford had 370,000 vehicles on dealer lots, up from 201,000 a year earlier, a strong signal that supply chain problems were easing.
Models responsible for the increase included pickup trucks, the Bronco sport utility vehicle and battery-powered models. Ford sold 2,264 electric F-150 Lightning pickup trucks, up from just 63 in January 2022, when the vehicle had just become available. It also sold 2,626 Mustang Mach-E electric S.U.V.s, up 11 percent.
Ford halted production of the Mach-E in January while modifying its plant in Cuautitlán, just north of Mexico City, to increase output. Production will restart this month, the company said.
On Wednesday, Honda, Hyundai and Kia reported sales increases of 9 percent to 22 percent, also as a result of improved supplies of vehicles. But Toyota said its January sales fell 15 percent to 134,392 cars and trucks.

Ford Motor said Thursday that sales of cars and trucks in the United States increased 2% in January as supply chain problems eased. Sales of electric vehicles more than doubled in the month.
The automaker sold 145,070 cars and light trucks last month, compared with 142,445 vehicles in January 2022, when its production was slowed by a shortage of computer chips, leaving dealers with few vehicles to sell. At the end of last month, Ford had 370,000 vehicles on dealer lots, up from 201,000 a year earlier.
Models responsible for the increase included pickup trucks, Bronco SUVs and battery-powered models. Ford sold 2,264 electric F-150 Lightning pickup trucks, up from just 63 in January 2022, when the vehicle had just become available. It also sold 2,626 Mustang Mach-E electric SUVs, up 11%.
Ford halted production of the Mach-E in January while modifying its plant in Cuautitlán, just north of Mexico City, to increase output. The company said production would restart this month.
On Wednesday, Honda, Hyundai and Kia reported sales increases of 9% to 22%, also as a result of improved supplies of vehicles. But Toyota said its January sales fell 15%, to 134,392 cars and trucks.
Ford is expected to release its earnings report for 2022 and the last three months of last year Thursday afternoon. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

G.M. Reports Strong Profits as It Moves to Challenge Tesla: [Correction]

Full text: Aiming to make a million electric vehicles a year by 2025, General Motors is investing in a Nevada lithium mine to help with battery production.
General Motors on Tuesday reported solid profits for 2022, after overcoming the computer chip shortages and softening demand that has slowed much of the auto industry last year.
The company reported $ 9.9 billion in net income, slightly below the total from the year before, while revenue rose 23 percent to $ 157 billion. It sold 3.6 million vehicles globally, up from 2.9 million in 2021.
"Our team rose to every challenge that was thrown at them in 2022," G.M.'s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said in a conference call.
In the fourth quarter, when rising interest rates began to slow sales of new cars and trucks, G.M. generated $ 2 billion in profit, an increase of 15 percent from a year earlier. Revenue rose 28 percent to $ 43 billion. Vehicle sales increased 30 percent to 967,000.
G.M. shares rose more than 8 percent in trading on Tuesday, closing above $ 39.
The automaker forecast that profit in 2023 will be $ 8.7 billion to $ 10.1 billion. "We expect that our momentum will help us deliver strong results once again in 2023," Ms. Barra said.
She also said G.M. would seek to cut costs by about $ 2 billion and expected to reduce its work force through attrition. "We are not planning layoffs," she said.
In electric vehicles, G.M. has been gearing up to compete head-on with Tesla, the leader. G.M. said that it expected to produce about 400,000 electric vehicles from 2022 through the first half of 2024, and that it would be capable of annual E.V. production of more than one million in North America in 2025.
A new battery plant in Ohio began production in August, and a second battery plant is to open in Tennessee this year. The company has started selling some high-end electric vehicles using battery packs made in Ohio, and it expects its E.V. sales to increase this year as it adds more affordable models, like an electric Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck and electric Chevrolet Equinox and Blazer sport utility vehicles.
All told, G.M. should have nine electric models available in the United States by the end of the year, Ms. Barra said.
To support its E.V. push, G.M. announced Tuesday, it is investing $ 650 million in a mining company, Lithium America, to develop a Nevada mine extracting lithium, a key battery ingredient. Production there is expected to start in 2026, Ms. Barra said.
But competition is getting keener. Automakers including Ford Motor, Volkswagen, Hyundai and Kia have also rushed new E.V.s to the U.S. market. And on Monday, Ford cut prices of its Mustang Mach-E electric S.U.V., after Tesla cut its prices in mid-January by as much as 20 percent.
Garrett Nelson, an analyst with the financial research firm CFRA, said more than 100 E.V. models would be offered in the U.S. market by 2025. "We view the risk of market oversaturation as very high, and an industry pricing war should pressure margins," he said. "We remain skeptical that G.M. will achieve sales success with many of its new E.V. models."

Following Tesla's Example, Ford Slashes Prices on E.V.s: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The automaker reduced the price of the Mustang Mach-E by up to $ 5,900 after Tesla slashed prices of its cars by as much as 20 percent.
Ford Motor said on Monday that it was cutting prices on its top-selling battery-powered model, the Mustang Mach-E, and increasing production of the sport utility vehicle. It was the latest sign of intensifying competition in the electric car market.
Two weeks ago, Tesla slashed prices of its electric cars by as much as 20 percent in response to softening demand around the world.
The price cuts for the two most affordable versions of the Mach-E amounted to less than $ 1,000 each. Other models, with longer-range batteries and premium options, were reduced $ 3,680 to $ 5,900, reductions of 6 percent to 9 percent.
"We want to make E.V.s more accessible, so we're increasing production and reducing prices across the Mach-E lineup," Ford's chief executive, Jim Farley, said on Twitter. He added that "with higher production, we're reducing costs, which allows us to share these savings with customers."
The lowest-priced Mustang Mach-E -- a rear-wheel-drive model with a standard battery -- now has a list price of $ 45,995, a reduction of $ 900. The high-performance Mach-E GT with an extended-range battery now sells for $ 63,995, a cut of $ 5,900.
Tesla's least expensive car is the Model 3, which is smaller than the Mustang Mach-E and starts at $ 43,990. The all-wheel-drive Model Y, a more direct competitor of the electric Mustang, starts at $ 53,490. An all-wheel-drive Mustang Mach-E with comparable battery range now lists for $ 53,995.
Electric vehicles priced below $ 55,000 can qualify for federal tax credits of $ 7,500 that were made available starting Jan. 1 under the Inflation Reduction Act. Ford's price cuts will make more versions of the Mach-E eligible for the credit.
Ford said the new prices would automatically apply to customers who had placed orders and were waiting for their cars. Ford's credit division is also offering subsidized interest rates as low as 5.34 percent on Mach E orders placed between Jan. 30 and April 3.
Tesla has long dominated the electric car market, which it largely had to itself until the last couple of years, but is increasingly encountering stiff competition. Its rate of growth has slowed in China, where its is now outsold by a local manufacturer, BYD. In addition to Ford, Volkswagen, Hyundai, Kia and other automakers have introduced electric models in the United States that are selling well and are generally cheaper than Tesla's luxury models.
In 2022, Ford sold just under 40,000 Mach-Es, about 45 percent more than in 2021. That made the Mach-E the third-best-selling electric model after Tesla's Model Y and Model 3.
For much of the last two years, Tesla, Ford and other automakers raised prices of electric vehicles because demand for battery-powered cars far outstripped supply. But demand for cars and other big-ticket goods has weakened in recent months as the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates significantly. Fed policymakers are expected to slow their rate increases at their first meeting of the year on Wednesday.

Despite Tesla's 'Incredibly Challenging Year,' Carmaker's Profit Rose 12% in Fourth Quarter: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The electric car company is facing intensifying competition, supply chain disruptions and concerns about the behavior of Elon Musk.
Tesla reported a respectable jump in profit for the last quarter of 2022, but slipping profit margins and slowing sales growth underlined the challenges that have weighed on the carmaker's stock.
The profit increase of 12 percent capped a tumultuous year that included intensifying competition, supply chain disruptions and concerns about the behavior of its chief executive, Elon Musk. There is no sign from Tesla's report to shareholders on Wednesday that those problems are going away.
The year was dominated by Mr. Musk's acquisition of Twitter, which led to complaints by Tesla investors that he was neglecting his duties at the carmaker at a critical time.
Tesla shares fell 65 percent during 2022 as investors doubted whether the company was reacting energetically enough to a long list of challenges and risks.
Among other things, investors worried that Mr. Musk would sell more of his stake in Tesla to finance his Twitter acquisition, flooding the market. They worried about Tesla's prospects in China, the world's largest car market, because of problems maintaining the supply of critical parts and growing competition from rivals like the Chinese manufacturer BYD. During 2022, BYD surpassed Tesla in total electric cars sold in China.
At the same time, slowing economic growth and rising interest rates in the United States threatened to reduce the number of people who can afford a Tesla. Fourth-quarter deliveries rose 18 percent, to 405,000 vehicles, the company said on Jan. 2, a lot less than Wall Street analysts had expected and short of Tesla's own targets.
"It was our best year ever on every level," Mr. Musk said during a conference call with investors on Wednesday. But he acknowledged that "2022 was an incredibly challenging year."
Mr. Musk also addressed criticism that his statements on Twitter had alienated some potential buyers. His 127 million followers on the platform, he said, "suggests I'm reasonably popular."
While acknowledging that he might have offended some people, he maintained that his presence on the platform helps Tesla. "Twitter is actually an incredible tool for driving demand," he said.
Tesla shares recouped some of their losses in January after the company slashed prices on most of its electric cars in the United States and Europe to revive sales. The price of a Model 3 sedan, the least expensive Tesla, dropped by $ 3,000, selling now for $ 44,000 in the United States before government incentives.
The markdowns appear to have prompted a surge in orders and helped reassure investors that Tesla had a plan to retain its dominance in electric cars. Tesla faces a stronger challenge from established car companies like Hyundai, Ford Motor, General Motors and Volkswagen, which are selling more battery-powered vehicles and at lower prices than Tesla.
Although the price cuts helped to promote sales, they also took a toll on Tesla's profit margin. The gross profit margin on car sales slipped to 26 percent in the fourth quarter from 28 percent in the third quarter of 2022 and 31 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Tesla said on Wednesday it would begin production of its long-awaited Cybertruck by the end of the year, although it won't be able to ramp-up manufacturing of large numbers of the vehicle until 2024. Delays in the truck, which was unveiled in 2019, have allowed rivals like Rivian and Ford to beat Tesla to market with electric pickups.
"The fact the Cybertruck is on schedule is a big positive," Garrett Nelson, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, said in a note to clients.
Net profit for the quarter was $ 3.7 billion, up from $ 3.3 billion in the third quarter, Tesla said. For the full year, Tesla's profit more than doubled to $ 12.6 billion from $ 5.5 billion in 2021. Sales for the year, including revenue from solar panels, energy storage and other businesses, rose to $ 81.5 billion from $ 53.8 billion the previous year.
Tesla said it expected to produce 1.8 million cars in 2023, up from 1.4 million in 2022. That would be a more modest rate of growth than in 2022, when production increased by nearly 50 percent.
Tesla's shares have risen by one-third since the beginning of January, though the stock price is still more than 60 percent below the high it set in November 2021.
Tesla earnings were among the most closely watched numbers on Wall Street this week. It remains the world's most valuable car company by far and is growing much faster than more established automakers.

Full text: The price reductions in the United States will make more of the company's electric vehicles eligible for a federal tax credit.
Tesla has cut prices on most of its electric cars in the United States and Europe by as much as 20 percent in a bid to spur slackening demand.
The automaker faces increasingly stiff competition in the global market for electric vehicles. It also must contend with rising interest rates in the United States, which have increased the cost of financing vehicle purchases.
"I think Tesla recognizes they are not the only game in town and the Detroit companies are jumping into the deep end with E.V.s," said Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst. "I think the price cuts mean Tesla is going to rip the Band-Aid off and try to go on the offensive."
Tesla stock fell sharply in early trading Friday after the price cuts were reported, but ended the day less than 1 percent lower. The share price has fallen roughly 70 percent since November 2021.
The cuts will allow some of Tesla's lower-priced models, depending on optional features, to qualify for federal tax credits of $ 7,500 that were made available starting Jan. 1 under the Inflation Reduction Act. The credit is available on electric cars priced under $ 55,000.
Tesla has enjoyed rapid growth for the last decade but now must contend with a variety of challenges, including concerns that its chief executive, Elon Musk, is too preoccupied with Twitter, the social media platform he acquired last year for $ 44 billion.
Mr. Musk has sold billions of dollars of Tesla stock to finance the Twitter acquisition, which has depressed Tesla's stock price, and he has come under fire for firing a large portion of Twitter's employees. He has also aired polarizing political views on the social media platform -- including several messages that appeared to support Russia in its war against Ukraine -- that have hurt his and Tesla's reputation with some consumers.
Tesla is not alone in dealing with slowing sales. U.S. auto sales fell about 8 percent last year to fewer than 14 million cars and trucks, the lowest level since 2011, mainly because shortages of computer chips prevented manufacturers from producing as many vehicles as consumers wanted to buy. In addition, rising borrowing rates made customer financing more expensive.
Sales of electric vehicles, however, rose 66 percent to more than 808,619, according to Kelley Blue Book, a market researcher. And while Tesla continues to dominate the segment, several automakers are gaining ground. Ford, Volkswagen and several other automakers posted sizable increases in E.V. sales last year and offer many models that were significantly more affordable than Tesla's. Hyundai and its affiliate Kia together sold more than 43,000 electric vehicles in the United States in 2022, up from a just few hundred in 2021.
New competitors are on the way, too. This year, General Motors is supposed to start making electric versions of its Chevrolet Silverado pickup and Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox sport utility vehicles.
Tesla has also had trouble in China, its largest market, where a local manufacturer, BYD, is now the No. 1 electric vehicle brand. Tesla recently lowered prices in China and reported a global sales total for 2022 that was below analysts' expectations.
While still hailed for the advanced technologies it packs into its cars, and their sleek styling, Tesla has been slow to add to its model line. It offers only four vehicles, and two are luxury models out of reach of most mainstream consumers. It last introduced a car in 2020, when the Model Y went into production.
Since 2019, Tesla has promised to introduce a pickup, called the Cybertruck, but has delayed its production several times. The company now hopes to begin making it this year. The Cybertruck has an angular, futuristic design and is expected to be sold as a luxury vehicle, which could limit its appeal. In the past, Mr. Musk has expressed a desire to produce an electric car that can sell for around $ 25,000, but he has laid out no formal plans.
In December, Tesla began delivering a small number of battery-powered semi trucks to PepsiCo, its first customer.
"We see demand problems remaining until Tesla is able to introduce a lower-priced offering in volume, which may only be in 2025," Toni Sacconaghi, a Bernstein analyst, said in a report this month.
In cutting the prices of its current models, Tesla is indicating that it is willing to concede some profit in order to increase sales volume. The company typically shows gross profit margins of 26 percent -- more than double that of some rival automakers -- a factor that led investors to bid up its stock, making it the world's most valuable car company.
The latest price cut on Tesla vehicles appeared on the company's website late Thursday. The automaker now shows a high-end Model 3 Performance compact selling in the United States for just under $ 54,000, down from $ 63,000, a cut of 14 percent.
The most affordable version of the Model 3 now sells for just under $ 44,000, a reduction of about $ 3,000 or 6 percent. The Model Y now starts at $ 53,000, a cut of 20 percent from the previous price of $ 66,000.
The company's websites for Germany, France and other European nations showed similar price cuts. The base Model 3 is now listed at 44,000 euros, a reduction of about 12 percent from the previous price.
In the past, Tesla's sales were helped by $ 7,500 tax credits provided by an earlier federal program. Those credits were no longer available after Tesla sold 200,000 vehicles in the U.S. market, but the company's sales continued to grow rapidly. Tesla has forecast that its sales will grow about 50 percent a year for the next few years.
Tesla sold 1.3 million cars in 2022, a 40 percent increase from the year before but short of the 50 percent target.
The company seemed to weather the computer chip shortage early in the pandemic better than most other automakers. Many had to idle plants temporarily at times because of shortages of certain electronic parts. Although Tesla, too, was affected, it said it was able to rewrite software that could run on substitute chips that were in more plentiful supply.
Tesla's fourth-quarter production of 440,000 cars was 34,000 more than the company delivered, suggesting that the sluggishness went beyond supply chain problems and production issues.

Full text: Messages and online posts from the Ph.D. student now charged with four murders show that he was once detached and suicidal before he became fascinated with criminals' minds.
MOSCOW, Idaho -- A criminology Ph.D. student charged with stabbing four University of Idaho students to death had written years ago of having suicidal thoughts, not being able to feel emotions and observing his own life as if it were a video game, saying he could do "whatever I want with little remorse."
The new revelations about the suspect, Bryan Kohberger, come from posts he made on an online forum in which he discussed his mental health struggles, as well as from interviews with those who knew him and messages he sent to friends that were obtained by The New York Times.
They paint a portrait of an anxious, isolated and depressed teenager who turned to heroin use before eventually getting clean and becoming fascinated with studying criminal psychology, saying then that he hoped to one day provide counseling for high-profile criminals.
"I feel like an organic sack of meat with no self worth," he wrote in 2011, when he was 16, adding later, in the same post: "As I hug my family, I look into their faces, I see nothing, it is like I am looking at a video game, but less."
Now, Mr. Kohberger, 28, is facing murder charges, accused of sneaking into a home shared by students just off the university campus in Moscow, Idaho, and stabbing four of them to death, in the middle of the night. At the time of the killings, Mr. Kohberger was in the first semester of his Ph.D. program at Washington State University, a 15-minute drive from the crime scene.
He has maintained his innocence through his lawyer, and on Thursday waived his right to a speedy preliminary hearing. A judge set a June date for the hearing, when prosecutors will outline evidence in an attempt to prove they have probable cause to try him on murder charges.
The police have disclosed some of the evidence that led them to arrest Mr. Kohberger at his parents' home in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, saying they had relied on DNA from a knife sheath left on a bed with two of the victims, cellphone records that suggest his phone had been in the area a dozen times before the murders occurred and surveillance footage of a white Hyundai, like the one Mr. Kohberger drove.
But the authorities have not outlined any motive for the killings, leaving families of the victims and acquaintances of the accused killer searching for answers.
"It's wild," said Jack Baylis, a Pennsylvania friend of Mr. Kohberger's who is among those trying to understand how Mr. Kohberger came to be charged with such a heinous killing. "Bryan himself would've been fascinated by it."
In online posts by Mr. Kohberger dating from when he was a teenager, he berates himself and talks about feeling disconnected from society, unable to find meaning in life. He describes an array of mental health challenges, including anxiety, depression, depersonalization, lack of emotion and the "constant thought of suicide."
The words were posted on a forum website called Tapatalk, previously known as Yuku, where Mr. Kohberger commiserated with other users while suffering from a little-understood neurological condition called visual snow, in which a person's vision is obscured by scattering dots, much like the static seen on an analog television.
Mr. Kohberger did not use his name on the website, but the posts included a reference to his birthday. In addition, the username on the account, "Exarr," matches an email address for Bryan Kohberger that appeared in a 2009 leak of accounts from an online payment company; that account listed his location as Effort, Pa., the place where Mr. Kohberger grew up. Some of the posts also contained details that friends said matched their recollections of his behavior and struggles at the time.
Friends have previously described Mr. Kohberger as having an intellectual bent, but said that he occasionally turned cruel and angry. At Washington State, his peers said he rankled some people with a habit of overexplaining, and sounded particularly condescending when he spoke to his female classmates.
The online posts from his teenage years provide a deeper insight into what appeared to be a dark period of his life. On the forum website, Mr. Kohberger wrote that he saw a "sickly, tired, useless and stupid man" when he looked at himself in the mirror, and felt that he did not deserve to live. He also lamented treating his father "like dirt" though he considered him a good man.
"Nothing I do is enjoyable," Mr. Kohberger wrote. "I am blank, I have no opinion, I have no emotion, I have nothing. Can you relate?"
Mr. Kohberger said that his absence of emotion had begun about the same time as his visual snow symptoms, in September 2009, and one friend recalled him constantly talking about his fuzzy vision.
"I know it was something that really bugged him," said Thomas Arntz, who was friends with Mr. Kohberger during high school, until they had a falling out. "He was basically to the point where he was neurotic about it."
Dr. Francesca Puledda, a neurologist and researcher at King's College London who specializes in visual snow, said it is so little understood that there is debate among scientists over whether to call it a disease. But Dr. Puledda has worked with people who find the condition to be debilitating.
"We still don't know what causes it," she said. "We simply have to do more research."
Dr. Puledda said that the presence of visual snow is not a sign of mental illness, but noted that one research team found that people who have the syndrome also report a high incidence of psychiatric issues, such as anxiety, depression and depersonalization.
Mr. Kohberger wrote that he had tried anti-migraine medication, visited a neurologist and gone on a strict diet -- one that avoided sugar and starch -- to try to resolve the vision problem.
"He wouldn't eat any bread and he would only eat certain fruits," Mr. Arntz recalled. "It was very restrictive."
By 2012, it appeared that Mr. Kohberger was learning to live with the problem. Sounding more optimistic, he wrote on the forum that he had accepted his ailment and was coming to terms with it.
He graduated from high school in 2013 but had also begun to use heroin around that time, friends said.
Rich Pasqua, who graduated from high school a few years ahead of Mr. Kohberger, said they used heroin together in 2013 and 2014, at a time when they both worked at a pizza shop called New York Pizza Girl, in Effort, Pa.
Mr. Pasqua, now 31, recalled that Mr. Kohberger was socially awkward and did not appear to have many friends, frequently calling him and offering to share his marijuana. Mr. Pasqua, who said he is now sober and working at a rehabilitation center, recalled in one instance driving with Mr. Kohberger through the gated community where Mr. Kohberger's parents lived, trying to evade a private security guard.
"We would make it to a cul-de-sac and we'd see their orange lights and Bryan would be like, 'Go this way!"' Mr. Pasqua recalled. "He was like, 'We're going to get in so much trouble."'
Mr. Pasqua said his wife, who was in Mr. Kohberger's year, remembered that Mr. Kohberger had been heavier when he was in high school and was bullied over his weight. (Mr. Kohberger wrote in the online forum in 2011 of having lost half his body weight.) And Mr. Pasqua recalled teasing him on one occasion as well, telling Mr. Kohberger to walk to the private community's gates in the snow to get some heroin from him, only to not be there when he showed up.
Eventually, Mr. Pasqua said, Mr. Kohberger's father would pick up the phone when he called, once saying that his son was "on a top-secret mission," which Mr. Pasqua realized meant he was in rehab.
Years later, Mr. Kohberger appeared to be doing much better, studying psychology at DeSales University in Eastern Pennsylvania and telling one friend that his drug problems were in the past.
"I only used when I was in a deep suicidal state," Mr. Kohberger wrote in May 2018 to Mr. Baylis, with whom he had been friends since eighth grade. "I have since really learned a lot. Not a person alive could convince me to use it." Mr. Kohberger followed up later that day, telling Mr. Baylis that he had been off drugs for two years and telling him to not mention his drug use again, according to screenshots of their conversation on Facebook Messenger.
He told Mr. Baylis at one point that he thought he had been depressed since he was 5 years old, for so long that he had "developed a weird sense of meaning."
In one message from October 2018, Mr. Kohberger wrote that he was interested in studying criminals. He said he would like to be involved in capturing violent criminals but that it could be difficult to get a job like that.
"I'm thinking more along the lines of dealing with high-profile offenders," he wrote. "Counseling."
Among the details that emerged in a police affidavit last week was that Mr. Kohberger had, last fall, applied for an internship with the Police Department in Pullman, Wash., where he was living while studying at Washington State. Officials have declined to say whether or not he got the internship.
The University of Idaho victims -- Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20 -- were killed after spending a typical Saturday night around town, with two of them going to a party and two others going to a bar before returning home in the early morning hours. Investigators believe all four were killed shortly after 4 a.m.
Two more roommates were at home at the time of the attack but were not hurt. One told the police that she had heard crying and voices around 4 a.m., and had opened her bedroom door to see a man -- wearing black clothing and a mask -- walking by her toward the home's back door, according to a police affidavit. The roommate locked herself in her room, and it is unclear what she did after that, but no one in the apartment called 911 until just before noon.
Shanon Gray, a lawyer for the family of Ms. Goncalves, said family members have been searching for information that might show a connection between the victims and Mr. Kohberger, but that no link has emerged so far.
"They didn't know him," he said.

Full text: Hanwha Qcells expects to make solar panels and their components in the United States to take advantage of President Biden's climate policies.
The climate and tax bill President Biden signed in August to increase the use of green energy and electric cars while expanding domestic manufacturing appears to be yielding some results.
A Korean solar company, Hanwha Qcells, announced on Wednesday that it would spend $ 2.5 billion to build a large manufacturing complex in Georgia. The plant will produce critical components for solar panels and build complete panels. If realized, the company's plans could bring some of the supply chain for solar energy, which is largely based in China, to the United States.
Qcells, which has its headquarters in Seoul, said it was making the investment to take advantage of tax credits and other benefits in the Inflation Reduction Act, the law Mr. Biden signed last summer. The manufacturing complex is expected to create 2,500 jobs in Cartersville, Ga., roughly 50 miles northwest of Atlanta, and at an existing plant in Dalton, Ga. Production at the new plant is expected to start in 2024.
The company opened its first solar panel manufacturing plant in Georgia in 2019, quickly becoming one of the largest U.S. producers -- by the end of last year, it was cranking out 12,000 panels a day. The company said its new complex would increase its capacity to 60,000 panels a day.
"As demand for clean energy continues to grow nationally, we're ready to put thousands of people to work creating fully American-made and sustainable solar solutions, from raw material to finished panels," Justin Lee, chief executive of Qcells, said in a statement.
Senator Jon Ossoff, Democrat of Georgia, and the state's Republican governor, Brian Kemp, have aggressively courted renewable energy, battery and automotive companies to the state. Several of those investments have come from South Korea, including a planned electric vehicle plant by Hyundai.
"With a focus on innovation and technology, Georgia continues to set itself apart as the No. 1 state for business," Mr. Kemp said in a statement.
In 2021, Mr. Ossoff introduced a bill, the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, that would have provided tax incentives to solar manufacturers. The bill was later incorporated into the Inflation Reduction Act.
Under the legislation, businesses receive a tax credit at every stage of the supply chain. The act includes an estimated $ 30 billion in production tax credits to accelerate manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries and for the processing of critical minerals. The law also offers an investment tax credit to companies that build factories that produce electric vehicles, wind turbines and solar panels.
Those and other provisions are intended to reduce reliance on China, which dominates the supply chain for crucial raw materials and components for batteries and solar panels. In addition to the fear that the United States was losing ground in important technologies, lawmakers have also been concerned that some Chinese producers are using forced labor.
"I wrote and passed into law legislation precisely intended to attract this type of manufacturing," Mr. Ossoff said in an interview. "It's the largest solar manufacturing in U.S. history coming to Georgia. This economic and geostrategic competition will continue, but my law has brought the United States back into the fight to secure our energy independence."
Lawmakers and administrations from both parties have long sought to boost a domestic solar manufacturing industry, including by imposing tariffs and other restrictions on imported solar panels. But such efforts have, so far, achieved only modest results. Most of the solar panels installed in the United States are imported.
The new plant "will bring back our supply chains so we aren't reliant on other countries, lower the cost of clean energy, and help us combat the climate crisis," Mr. Biden said in a statement. "And, it will ensure that we manufacture cutting-edge, solar technology here at home."
The Qcells project and others could reduce U.S. reliance on imports, but not quickly. China and other Asian countries have had a huge head start in assembling panels and producing the parts that go into them. Governments there have also used subsidies, energy policy, trade agreements and other tactics to help domestic producers.
While the Inflation Reduction Act has spurred new investment, it has also raised tensions between the Biden administration and U.S. allies like France and South Korea.
For example, the law offers tax credits of up to $ 7,500 for the purchase of electric cars, but it is only available on vehicles made in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Consumers seeking to buy models made by Hyundai and its subsidiary Kia would not be eligible for at least two years until the company's new Georgia plant begins production in 2025.
Still, energy and auto executives have said that on the whole, the legislation should benefit their businesses, which struggled to get important parts when the pandemic and Russia's war in Ukraine wrecked global supply chains.
Mike Carr, executive director of the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America Coalition, said he expected more companies to announce plans for new solar equipment factories in the United States in the first six months of the year. His group estimates that between 2030 and 2040, U.S. plants will be able to meet all of the country's demand for solar panels.
"We see this in the medium to longer term as a very, very large contributor to lower prices in the United States," Mr. Carr said referring to the cost of panels.
Several other solar companies have announced new U.S. manufacturing plants in recent months, including CubicPV, a start-up backed by Bill Gates that plans to begin production of solar panel components in 2025.
Another company, First Solar, said in August that it would build its fourth panel manufacturing plant in the United States. First Solar plans to invest $ 1.2 billion to expand its operations and add 1,000 jobs.

In Seoul, It's Like Another Olympics: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: The inaugural Frieze Seoul fair was one sign of the city's ascent. Now a dealer invasion is underway and artists are navigating a new landscape, as competition heats up.
SEOUL -- One recent afternoon in the vibrant Itaewon neighborhood, art types trickled into a four-story building that the Berlin and Paris gallery Esther Schipper had just unveiled as a showroom, to catch an interactive performance by the artist Tino Sehgal. It involved a girl, in character, delivering a short monologue and addressing questions to her audience. At one point, she turned to an artist on hand and asked, "Would you rather feel too busy or not busy enough?" Not a fair question: Anyone trying to keep up with art in this art-mad city hardly has a choice.
New museums are opening, foreign galleries are alighting and corporations are plowing money into contemporary art. Frieze opened a fair here in September, some 120 exhibitors strong, and the international art world flew in. At Samsung's palatial Leeum Museum of Art, "Squid Game" stars and visiting museum curators watched the K-pop girl group Kep1er. At a club in the industrial Euljiro neighborhood, the artist Haegue Yang hosted a blowout that lasted into the early morning. Finally, after cautious pandemic management, this metropolitan area of 26 million -- that's half the country's population in an area the size of Connecticut -- felt gloriously alive.
Amid the action, one young gallery worker told me he was proud that Frieze, which has editions in London, New York and Los Angeles, had picked South Korea instead of rival Japan for its first fair in Asia. And the Seoul-born art dealer, Jason Haam, 32, enthused in an interview, "It's kind of like the World Cup or Olympics coming into this country." It is an exhilarating moment for art and a complicated one, as everyone navigates rapid changes, sizes up the newcomers and angles for position, as economic fears loom.
"I think it was long overdue that people recognized Seoul, Korea, as an art hub," said Emma Son, the senior director at Lehmann Maupin's gallery here. She has been in Seoul's gallery sector for more than two decades and was sitting in her office, next to a painting by the midcareer Korean artist Keunmin Lee, who channels body horror in virtuosic near-abstractions. Lehmann Maupin, which also has New York and London branches, moved into its elegant two-floor space this year, after opening a smaller showroom in 2017. Pace has also expanded dramatically, and Perrotin just added a second space. Almost 300 galleries were counted in Seoul in a 2020 survey by the Korea Arts Management Service, a government agency.
A dealer invasion is underway. In March, Tang Contemporary Art (Bangkok, Beijing, Hong Kong) moved into a capacious exhibition hall in the ultrawealthy Cheongdam area. In April, Peres Projects, a talent-spotting outfit in Berlin and Milan, grabbed a shop in the ritzy Shilla Hotel; it is now prepping a gallery in Samcheong, the preserve of mainstays like Hyundai and PKM. That same month, Gladstone (three New York galleries, one in Brussels) also landed in Cheongdam, where König (Berlin, London) set up in 2021 on the upper floors of an MCM store.
The collector base in South Korea "is big, but it's not as big as China, or the U.S. or Europe," Son said, "so the competitiveness is going to be tough between the galleries."
It may soon be tough between South Korea and other locales, as well. Hong Kong's political crackdown and strict coronavirus quarantine helped Seoul, but those rules have been dropped. Japan has loosened its tax rules for art, and a fair is on tap for Tokyo this summer from a team that includes the founders of what became Art Basel Hong Kong and that is also behind one starting Jan. 12 in another wealthy Asian city: Singapore.
The foreign influx has its pluses and minuses. "It is pretty nice for me because I can see those works that I would have had to see somewhere else," while traveling, said Kyungmin Lee in the basement office of Whistle, the Itaewon gallery for emerging artists she started in 2017.
Though major international galleries are coming to Seoul, they are "still separated from the Korean art scene," said the curator Haeju Kim, who organized this year's Busan Biennale in that city on the southern coast. Even the arrivals with big-name Korean artists on their rosters have largely focused on exhibiting European and American talent. In its first year in business here, Thaddaeus Ropac, a European heavyweight, did that exclusively, showing only men. (This week it opens an exhibition of three Korean female artists on the rise.)
Blue-chip dealers and deep-pocketed collectors are, of course, only two parts of a viable industry. Art scenes rise or fall on their emerging artists. While this is difficult to measure, it feels far more challenging for a vanguard-minded young local artist to be represented by a gallery in Seoul than it would be in, say, New York, which is comparatively abundant in dealers eager to take risks on the new and untested.
"I want galleries to be more open to more experimental things," the artist Haena Yoo told me, taking a break at a coffee shop near her studio on a weekend morning. Yoo, 32, makes intricate sculptures and installations that incorporate organic substances and plumb how goods and identities are packaged and transform as they flow across borders. Homemade meju, a brick of fermented soybeans used in many Korean dishes, figures in some of her work. (She made sure to get a studio with a kitchen.)
Yoo was readying a solo show at Gallery Shilla, a veteran of the city of Daegu that opened here in 2021. After college in Seoul, she got her M.F.A. in California, and now splits her time between Los Angeles and the Korean capital. She said that she has seen dealers here become more intrepid in the past couple of years, perhaps spurred on by the expectations of younger patrons and all the new competition. Local ventures like P21, Gallery 2, Cylinder and BB & M have been injecting fresh energy.
Whistle came about when Lee, 38, wanted "to have some kind of opportunity for younger artists to show in a professional way, because it was lacking," she said. One of two Korean galleries in Frieze Seoul's section for emerging Asian galleries, it presented wily abstractions of flat, bright color by the Korean artist Hejum Bä. Some local collectors had been waiting more than a year for a Bä but ceded their planned purchases to foreigners -- "they want international collectors to collect the work and for her to be more well known," Lee said. "I collect, and it's really not easy to let it go. I almost cried. Everyone was so supportive."
The hope among many artists and dealers here is that this newfound attention will endure, and open doors beyond Korea. (The worry is that this may be a largely one-way relationship, with multinational galleries simply selling to a new market.) There are astonishingly talented artists here who have shown abroad only sparingly, like Heecheon Kim, an incisive video maker; Yooyun Yang, who conjures cinematic scenes from traditional ink-and-paper painting; Rondi Park, who makes hilarious works in every medium that are cut through with pathos; and Haneyl Choi, who crafts spare, enigmatic, queer sculptures.
The government has been providing grants to push along that process, helping artists and dealers exhibit widely, intent on generating a hallyu, or "Korean wave" that has propelled K-pop and Korean cinema to worldwide prominence. Korean corporations -- the family-owned conglomerates known as chaebol that have long been art buyers and philanthropists -- have also funded art initiatives abroad.
On the home front, too, there are government efforts to bolster art-making. "Korea has a good public-funding structure for residencies and studio spaces," said Sook-Kyung Lee, who started her career in the 1990s at South Korea's National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (MMCA). She is now senior curator of international art at Tate Modern in London. "Compared to Britain, it's just so much better," she said. Agencies give grants for artists to publish catalogs and stage exhibitions, though some criticize the mechanics of the process, which involves onerous paperwork and the use of funds to rent venues for brief runs.
Real estate is pricey in Seoul -- and most galleries are modest by Chelsea standards -- but people find ways to make it work. Scrappy alternative galleries, many run by artists, dot neighborhoods like Euljiro, Mullae and Seochon, and slices of the Mapo district. (Stalwarts includes WESS, Factory 2, Space 413, Sarubia and Saga.) For better and for worse, they can feel disconnected from the commercial sphere, and they come and go with heartbreaking speed.
"To be honest, at the start, I didn't mean to do this," Jungmin Cho said at one such space, White Noise, which she directs. It is in a basement with low ceilings that once held a catering business in a stretch of the Bangbae neighborhood lined with cozy cafes. "I was just gathering my friends and doing fun, experimental things without thinking about the future."
That was in 2018. People told her to keep it going. For one night, on Dec. 30, White Noise hosted its 37th project, with Lilbiitz (a "creative food project team") offering dishes inspired by the gallery's 2022 shows. The week of Frieze, Cho had artists make presentations of their work at a design shop before it was auctioned off, live, as a D.I.Y. sendup of that market ritual.
When it comes to the global art market, South Korea remains a minor player. Its total art sales in 2021 were 922.3 billion won (about $ 726 million at the current exchange rate), according to a report from Seoul National University and the Paradise Cultural Foundation. China's were around $ 13 billion, per an Art Basel and UBS survey. Auction turnover in Hong Kong alone was $ 1.7 billion for that year, according to Artprice -- more than six times South Korea's total.
But the major houses are taking an interest. Christie's staged a blockbuster exhibition of Francis Bacon and Adrian Ghenie during Frieze Seoul; Sotheby's hired Jane Yoon (formerly of Phillips) to open a new office, and Minhee Suh has joined Phillips as regional director after a dozen years at the local K Auction. In an interview, Suh described how she has seen collecting change. "Before it was just like a hobby," she said. Now "it's a kind of culture."
What is particularly striking about being in South Korea right now is the sense of possibility in the air. About 80 percent of its art museums -- more than 200 -- were established after 2000, according to the Korea Arts Management Service. The Seoul Museum of Art has seven branches in the city, and is readying three more. The federal government, meanwhile, is planning another for the hulking collection of art, books, and antiquities donated by the family of the Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee, who died in 2020.
Samsung's cultural foundation has two museums of its own -- the Leeum and, just south of Seoul, the Ho-Am, which will reopen in April after a renovation. Other corporate giants, like SK and Amorepacific, also operate art institutions. In 2021, ST International (an energy concern) inaugurated a striking building for its headquarters and its art nonprofit, SongEun, which focuses on up-and-coming Korean figures.
"We wanted -- through the architecture, through making a landmark with Herzog & de Meuron -- more exposure for our young artists," said SongEun's artistic director, Laurencina Farrant-Lee.
The pace of building in South Korea awes, but there are gripes that the quality of public exhibitions, and professional standards, varies widely. Many public collections remain in nascent stages, and their acquisition budgets are not large.
The national museum, MMCA, had about $ 4 million for art buys in 2021, which would not cover half of the roughly $ 11.2 million that a collector, Kim Woong-ki, paid in 2019 for a 1971 Kim Whanki painting, the record price for Korean art at auction. It is a radiant, swirling work of minute blue marks, and it was just on view at a new art venue in an office building associated with Global Sae-A Group (clothing and more), where Kim is chairman. (Some have called for South Korea to adopt tax incentives for donating art to museums.)
Even as the city's art scene expands, there is a measure of nervousness. The Korean won has started to recover after a rough year, but economic uncertainty remains. If Frieze had been in 2021, "it would have been so much crazier," said Haam, the dealer, who opened his gallery in 2018 in an Italian restaurant that he gutted in the moneyed Seongbuk district. During Frieze, new paintings by the blue-chipper Urs Fischer hung on his walls, a feat for a young dealer with only a few years' experience.
Haam's parents are collectors, and while studying at Cornell University, he started selling art to his mother's friends back home, building an international roster. "I felt like I had a little bit of a safe haven here, especially at the incubation stage of the gallery," he said.
Those days are certainly over, but even as the scene gets crowded, Haam remains bullish, with plans to expand in Seoul. "Twenty years from now, if the country is as rich as it is right now," he said, "I think it can be like London or New York."

Full text: Court records unsealed this week provided vital and unsettling new details about the night four University of Idaho students were killed.
MOSCOW, Idaho -- After weeks of unease over the murders of four University of Idaho students in a house near campus, the authorities this week released their most detailed account yet of the investigation that led them to arrest a criminology student from a nearby university.
The documents detail an array of evidence about the suspect, Bryan Kohberger, 28, a graduate student at Washington State University, who said through a lawyer that he looks forward to being exonerated. The records also provided jarring new details about the night the four students were murdered, while raising fresh questions about a mystifying case in which authorities have not explained a possible motive.
Here are 10 key revelations made public on Thursday.
A roommate saw a masked man.
Investigators had previously suggested that two roommates who were inside the house on the night of the crime and were not attacked had been sleeping. But the records show that one of them awoke around 4 a.m. after hearing noises, a man's voice and crying. That was around the time the authorities believe the killings occurred.
That roommate, according to the records, eventually watched from her room as a man in black clothing with a mask on his face walked past her toward the home's back door. She reported locking her own bedroom door at that point, but it's unclear from the records what transpired afterward.
Authorities were not summoned to the scene for more than seven hours.
Investigators found a knife sheath at the scene.
On an upstairs bed where two victims -- Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves -- were found dead, investigators said they found a tan leather knife sheath.
The police said they were able to get a DNA sample from a button snap on the sheath, and later found a connection between that sample and DNA collected from Mr. Kohberger's parents' home in Pennsylvania.
That may prove to be a key piece of evidence, as authorities seek to tie Mr. Kohberger to the scene of the crime.
The suspect applied to work at a local police department.
Mr. Kohberger had long taken an interest in criminology and criminal law.
He studied in Pennsylvania in part under Katherine Ramsland, a forensic psychologist whose books include "The Mind of a Murderer" and "How to Catch a Killer." He researched the psychology of criminals when they committed crimes.
At Washington State University, he was pursuing a Ph.D., engaging in a class on DNA evidence and forensics in the weeks before the killings, while continuing to grade papers in the weeks afterward.
Authorities also disclosed that Mr. Kohberger had applied in recent months for an internship at the police department in Pullman, Wash., less than 10 miles from the University of Idaho campus in Moscow. He wrote an essay as part of the application in which he described his interest in helping rural police departments collect and analyze data.
A car passed the victims' house several times.
On the night of the killings, investigators said, a white automobile could be seen on surveillance footage repeatedly passing through the dead-end street where the victims lived.
The vehicle, which the police said was a Hyundai Elantra, started appearing around 3:29 a.m., passing by the area three times before returning for a fourth time at 4:04 a.m., around the time that the surviving roommate was awakened and that the police believe the killings occurred. The vehicle, the police said, could be seen speeding away from the area at 4:20 a.m.
Audio captured a dog barking.
At around 4:17 a.m., a security camera near the home of the victims picked up distorted audio of what sounded like a whimper and a loud thud, investigators said. They also said a dog could be heard barking numerous times.
After the killings were discovered, police officers arriving at the house found a dog in one of the rooms. The dog belonged to one of the victims, Kaylee Goncalves.
One of the victims may have been awake.
While the coroner has said that all four victims were probably asleep at the time of the killings, investigators suggested in the new court records that at least one of them may have been awake.
Xana Kernodle received a DoorDash delivery around 4 a.m., just before the arrival of the white vehicle, the investigators said. A forensic review of her phone also suggested that she was using the TikTok app at around 4:12 a.m.
A campus officer found Kohberger's car.
With the surveillance video in hand, the police began scouring the region for white Hyundai Elantras, and a campus police officer at Washington State University found one in November registered to Mr. Kohberger.
Investigators said they reviewed images of Mr. Kohberger and found that his physical appearance matched the recollection of the roommate who saw a man in the house, including his height, build and bushy eyebrows.
Police initially said they were looking for a 2011-13 Elantra, but later determined that it could also be from a model year as late as 2016. Mr. Kohberger had a 2015 Elantra.
Kohberger's phone disconnected during the killings.
By the end of December, investigators were able to get records of the location of Mr. Kohberger's cellphone.
The records showed that he had visited the neighborhood of the crime scene 12 times before the night of the killings, according to the police affidavit. On the night of the killings, his phone was in Pullman at 2:47 a.m., but then disconnected from the cell network.
The phone reconnected to the network at 4:48 a.m., at a location miles to the south of the University of Idaho. The phone eventually traveled back to Pullman.
The police suggest that the suspect may have returned to the crime scene.
Several hours after the killings, at around 9:12 a.m., Mr. Kohberger's phone was detected in Moscow, connecting to the cellular network near the scene of the murders and staying there for nine minutes, according to the police records.
The phone then returned to the area of his home in Pullman. At that point in the morning, no one had called 911, so the police had not yet gone to the crime scene.
A DNA sample was taken from trash in Pennsylvania.
In the days after obtaining Mr. Kohberger's phone records, investigators were in Pennsylvania, where Mr. Kohberger had driven for the holidays with his father.
Agents there recovered trash from the home of Mr. Kohberger's family and shipped it to Idaho. Investigators said they worked to match a DNA profile found in the trash to a DNA sample collected from the knife sheath found at the crime scene. The analysis, the police said, suggested a strong likelihood that the elder Mr. Kohberger was the father of whoever left DNA on the knife sheath.

MOSCOW, Idaho — After weeks of unease over the killings of four University of Idaho students in a house near campus, authorities this week released their most detailed account yet of the investigation that led them to arrest a criminology student from a nearby university.
The documents detail an array of evidence about the suspect, Bryan Kohberger, 28, a graduate student at Washington State University, who said through a lawyer that he looks forward to being exonerated. The records also provided jarring new details about the night the four students were killed, while raising fresh questions about a mystifying case in which authorities have not explained a possible motive.
Here are 10 key revelations made public Thursday.
A roommate saw a masked man.
Investigators had previously suggested that two roommates who were inside the house on the night of the crime and were not attacked had been sleeping. But the records show that one of them awoke around 4 a.m. after hearing noises, a man’s voice and crying. That was around the time authorities believe the killings occurred.
That roommate, according to the records, eventually watched from her room as a man in black clothing with a mask on his face walked past her toward the home’s back door. She reported locking her own bedroom door at that point, but it’s unclear from the records what transpired afterward.
Authorities were not summoned to the scene for more than seven hours.
Investigators found a knife sheath at the scene.
On an upstairs bed where two victims — Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves — were found dead, investigators said they found a tan leather knife sheath.
Police said they were able to get a DNA sample from a button snap on the sheath, and later found a connection between that sample and DNA collected from Kohberger’s parents’ home in Pennsylvania.
That may prove to be a key piece of evidence, as authorities seek to tie Kohberger to the scene of the crime.
The suspect applied to work at a local police department.
Kohberger had long taken an interest in criminology and criminal law.
He studied in Pennsylvania in part under Katherine Ramsland, a forensic psychologist whose books include “The Mind of a Murderer” and “How to Catch a Killer.” He researched the psychology of criminals when they committed crimes.
At Washington State University, he was pursuing a doctorate, engaging in a class on DNA evidence and forensics in the weeks before the killings, while continuing to grade papers in the weeks afterward.
Authorities also disclosed that Kohberger had applied in recent months for an internship at the police department in Pullman, Washington, less than 10 miles from the University of Idaho campus in Moscow. He wrote an essay as part of the application in which he described his interest in helping rural police departments collect and analyze data.
A car passed the victims’ house several times.
On the night of the killings, investigators said, a white automobile could be seen on surveillance footage repeatedly passing through the dead-end street where the victims lived.
The vehicle, which police said was a Hyundai Elantra, started appearing around 3:29 a.m., passing by the area three times before returning for a fourth time at 4:04 a.m., around the time that the surviving roommate was awakened and that the police believe the killings occurred. The vehicle, police said, could be seen speeding away from the area at 4:20 a.m.
Audio captured a dog barking.
At 4:17 a.m., a security camera near the home of the victims picked up distorted audio of what sounded like a whimper and a loud thud, investigators said. They also said a dog could be heard barking numerous times.
After the killings were discovered, police officers arriving at the house found a dog in one of the rooms. The dog belonged to one of the victims, Kaylee Goncalves.
One of the victims may have been awake.
While the coroner has said that all four victims were probably asleep at the time of the killings, investigators suggested in the new court records that at least one of them may have been awake.
Xana Kernodle received a DoorDash delivery around 4 a.m., just before the arrival of the white vehicle, the investigators said. A forensic review of her phone also suggested that she was using the TikTok app at 4:12 a.m.
A campus officer found Kohberger’s car.
With the surveillance video in hand, police began scouring the region for white Hyundai Elantras, and a campus police officer at Washington State University found one in November registered to Kohberger.
Investigators said they reviewed images of Kohberger and found that his physical appearance matched the recollection of the roommate who saw a man in the house, including his height, build and bushy eyebrows.
Police initially said they were looking for a 2011-13 Elantra, but later determined that it could also be from a model year as late as 2016. Kohberger had a 2015 Elantra.
Kohberger’s phone disconnected during the killings.
By the end of December, investigators were able to get records of the location of Kohberger’s cellphone.
The records showed that he had visited the neighborhood of the crime scene 12 times before the night of the killings, according to the police affidavit. On the night of the killings, his phone was in Pullman at 2:47 a.m., but then disconnected from the cell network.
The phone reconnected to the network at 4:48 a.m., at a location miles to the south of the University of Idaho. The phone eventually traveled back to Pullman.
The police suggest that the suspect may have returned to the crime scene.
Several hours after the killings, at 9:12 a.m., Kohberger’s phone was detected in Moscow, connecting to the cellular network near the scene of the murders and staying there for nine minutes, according to police records.
The phone then returned to the area of his home in Pullman. At that point in the morning, no one had called 911, so the police had not yet gone to the crime scene.
A DNA sample was taken from trash in Pennsylvania.
In the days after obtaining Kohberger’s phone records, investigators were in Pennsylvania, where Kohberger had driven for the holidays with his father.
Agents there recovered trash from the home of Kohberger’s family and shipped it to Idaho. Investigators said they worked to match a DNA profile found in the trash to a DNA sample collected from the knife sheath found at the crime scene. The analysis, police said, suggested a strong likelihood that the elder Kohberger was the father of whoever left DNA on the knife sheath. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On the night four college students were killed, a roommate saw a man clad in black walk through the home. It took a cross-country investigation to find a suspect.
MOSCOW, Idaho -- On the night in November when four University of Idaho students were murdered in a home near campus, another roommate awoke to a noise that she thought was her friend playing with her dog. Then she heard someone crying, and a man saying something like, "It's OK, I'm going to help you."
When the roommate peered out of her room just after 4 a.m., she later told investigators, she stood in "frozen shock" as a man wearing black clothes and a mask walked by her toward the home's back door. She did not recognize him, she said, but she noticed his bushy eyebrows.
It was not until many hours later that the full extent of what had happened upstairs and down the hall became clear: Four students had been stabbed to death, leaving two roommates -- and a dog whose barking had been loud enough to be heard outside -- alive.
On Thursday, law enforcement officials ended nearly two months of silence on the details of their investigation and unveiled an array of evidence they say left them with little doubt about the identity of the killer: Bryan Kohberger, a 28-year-old Ph.D. student in criminology at a neighboring university.
Mr. Kohberger, who was arrested on Dec. 30 at his parents' home in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, appeared in court for the first time in Idaho on Thursday to face charges of first-degree murder and felony burglary.
In a packed courtroom where the father of one victim was sitting in the front row, Mr. Kohberger hardly spoke except to say that he understood that the maximum penalty for each murder charge was life imprisonment or death. His public defender, Anne Taylor, said in court that Mr. Kohberger "has a good family that stands behind him." He has said through another lawyer that he looks forward to being exonerated.
Authorities have yet to detail a motive in the killings, nor has there been any explanation for why the two surviving roommates, who are also students at the University of Idaho, did not call 911 until shortly before noon the next day.
But in a small college town that had not recorded a murder in seven years, the newly unsealed court records offer a detailed account of how police officers, with the aid of dozens of F.B.I. agents, methodically triangulated clues. Among them were DNA found on a knife sheath left at the scene, surveillance cameras in the neighborhood, cellphone tower records and DNA from the suspect's father collected from the family's trash in Pennsylvania -- all of which, the police said, pointed to Mr. Kohberger.
The early morning attack at the house along a dead-end street, a five-minute walk from campus, claimed the lives of Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20.
It came after an otherwise typical Saturday night. Ms. Kernodle and Mr. Chapin, who were dating, had attended a fraternity party together, and Ms. Goncalves and Ms. Mogen had gone to a bar. All four victims, as well as the two surviving roommates, were back at the home before 2 a.m.
The new documents suggest that Ms. Kernodle was awake around the time of the killings, receiving a DoorDash delivery around 4 a.m. and apparently using the TikTok app on her phone 12 minutes later. Police said the murders likely happened before 4:25 a.m.
In addition to hearing the crying and the man's voice, the roommate on the second floor also heard one of her roommates say something like, "There's someone here," around 4 a.m.
At roughly the same time, a security camera from a nearby home picked up distorted audio of a whimpering sound and a loud thud. A dog could be heard barking several times.
A variety of surveillance footage collected from the neighborhood gave investigators some of their early leads, showing that, shortly before the crimes, a white Hyundai Elantra had made three passes along the dead-end street where the killings took place. It returned a fourth time, at 4:04 a.m., around the time the surviving roommate said she had woken up.
The vehicle was seen 16 minutes later leaving the neighborhood "at a high rate of speed," according to the affidavit, which was signed by Cpl. Brett Payne of the Moscow Police.
Investigators began scouring the region for similar cars. At the end of November, a campus police officer at Washington State University, which is about a 15-minute drive from the University of Idaho and the crime scene, discovered that an Elantra belonging to Mr. Kohberger was registered with the university.
The investigators soon found from Mr. Kohberger's driver's license that he matched the roommate's description of the man in the mask, including, they say, the bushy eyebrows.
In December, Mr. Kohberger drove home to Pennsylvania with his father for winter break while investigators were still piecing together their case. Two days before Christmas, the police were able to obtain cellphone tower records showing that on the night of the killings, Mr. Kohberger's phone had stopped connecting to cell towers somewhere near his apartment in Pullman at 2:47 a.m. before reconnecting somewhere south of Moscow at 4:48 a.m. -- suggesting that his phone had either traveled out of a coverage area or been turned off.
His phone had already been in the area of the house 12 times in the months before the murders, according to the affidavit.
He appears to have also been back in the vicinity of the house hours after the killings, but before the victims were found, according to the court affidavit. Cell tower records showed that his phone had traveled from Pullman back to Moscow, connecting for nine minutes to the cell network that services the neighborhood of the crime scene.
Investigators had another key piece of evidence: the DNA sample found on the button snap of a tan leather knife sheath that had been left on a bed next to the bodies of Ms. Goncalves and Ms. Mogen.
In December, investigators traced Mr. Kohberger to his parents' house in Pennsylvania. On Dec. 27, while he was there over winter break, the police managed to retrieve some garbage from the house and sent what appears to have been a DNA sample from Mr. Kohberger's father for testing. The results showed a strong probability that the elder Mr. Kohberger was the father of whoever left DNA on the knife sheath.
In a predawn raid on Dec. 30, the police broke through windows and doors of the family home and arrested the younger Mr. Kohberger. They followed up quickly with searches of his apartment in Pullman, the white Hyundai Elantra he had driven with his father to Pennsylvania and the parents' home. They also got a court order to obtain a direct DNA sample from Mr. Kohberger.
Friends of the victims have been searching for possible connections between the victims and the accused killer -- so far, disclosing none -- and classmates of Mr. Kohberger's at Washington State University have examined their own recollections to try to identify clues.
Some said Mr. Kohberger spent time studying the exact kind of techniques that the police used in recent weeks to identify him, and had a deep interest in criminal psychology and crime scenes.
Benjamin T. Roberts, a fellow graduate student at Washington State, said Mr. Kohberger had been interested in areas like psychology and Rational Choice Theory, which suggests that offenders may often try to assess the potential costs and benefits of committing a crime.
"He took the field of study very seriously," Mr. Roberts said.
But peers also said he at times caused conflict in the program. Mr. Roberts recalled that Mr. Kohberger tended to be more forceful and condescending in challenging the ideas of female students during discussions in classroom settings.
"There was a consistent pattern in which he would push back more with women colleagues than with male colleagues," he said.
One new revelation in the court affidavit had a tinge of irony: After enrolling in the Ph.D. program at Washington State in August, Mr. Kohberger had applied for an internship. In an essay as part of the application, he described his interest in helping rural police departments collect and analyze data as part of public safety operations. The internship he applied for was at the Pullman Police Department, whose officers would wind up helping in the investigation of the murders.

Supply Problems and Falling Demand Hurt Auto Sales: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A global semiconductor shortage is easing, which could allow carmakers to lift production this year. But higher interest rates could keep sales low.
Last year, sales of new cars and trucks fell to their lowest level in a decade because automakers could not make enough vehicles for consumers to buy. This year, sales are likely to remain soft, but for an entirely different reason -- weakening demand.
The Federal Reserve's interest rate increases, which are intended to slow inflation, have made it harder and more expensive for consumers to finance automobile purchases, after prices had already risen to record highs.
Analysts expect that higher rates and a slowing economy will force some U.S. shoppers to delay car purchases or steer away from showrooms altogether in 2023 even if automakers crank out more vehicles than they did last year because they can get more parts.
"For over a decade, low interest rates have helped people buy the big cars that Americans like," said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at Edmunds, a market research firm. "Low rates from the Fed are what made those attractive offers for zero-percent financing and 72-month loans possible, but with the higher rates, it's a pretty unfriendly market for people buying a car."
Edmunds estimates that automakers will sell 14.8 million cars and trucks in the United States this year, which would be well below the sales that automakers became accustomed to in the previous decade.
Analysts expect the industry will have sold fewer than 14 million light trucks and cars last year in the United States once large automakers have reported their deliveries for the year. That would be a decline of more than one million from 2021. Before the coronavirus pandemic, the industry typically sold more than 17 million new vehicles a year.
If the dour estimates are confirmed, last year's sales total will rank as the lowest since 2011, when the industry had only just begun recovering from the financial crisis and sold 12.7 million new cars and trucks.
"It seems likely that rising interest rates are now constraining demand in the retail auto market," Charles Chesbrough, senior economist at the market researcher Cox Automotive, said in a statement. "With record-high prices and elevated loan rates, the pool of potential new-vehicle buyers is shrinking."
Stellantis, the company formed through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, said its U.S. sales fell 13 percent in 2022. Honda reported a drop of by 33 percent, and Nissan's sales fell 25 percent. A main reason was the continuing shortage of computer chips, which forced manufacturers to slow or halt production at times over the last two years and left dealers with few vehicles to sell.
Toyota Motor, the world's largest automaker by number of vehicles sold, said on Wednesday that its U.S. sales fell about 10 percent, to 2.1 million vehicles in 2022. But in an indication that the supply of chips and other parts improved toward the end of the year, the company said sales in the fourth quarter jumped 13 percent from a year earlier.
General Motors was one of the few automakers that bucked the industry trend, reporting a 2.5 percent increase in U.S. sales last year, to 2.3 million vehicles, putting it just ahead of Toyota after G.M. fell to second place for the first time in decades in 2021. G.M. said deliveries in the fourth quarter were up 41 percent.
Sales of G.M.'s electric car, the Chevrolet Bolt, rose more than 50 percent to 38,120 for the year. The company also said sales of the GMC Hummer, an electric pickup truck that sells for more than $ 100,000, increased to 854. The company, which has said it aims to do away with internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035, is counting on several new electric models to increase sales this year.
Another company that did relatively well was Hyundai, the South Korean automaker that sells cars under the Hyundai and Kia brands and that has also made a big push into electric vehicles. It's full-year sales fell just 2 percent, and its fourth-quarter deliveries jumped 29 percent.
Sales were strong for electric vehicles and for companies that specialize in that fast-growing business.
Tesla on Monday reported a 40 percent increase in its global sales for 2022, but its deliveries in the last three months of the year fell short of analysts' expectations. The company's stock, which ended down 65 percent last year, fell 12 percent on Tuesday. It rose 5 percent on Wednesday by the close of trading.
And Rivian, a smaller electric vehicle company, said on Tuesday that it fell several hundred vehicles short of its goal of producing 25,000 trucks, sport utility vehicles and vans in 2022.
Ford Motor is expected to report its sales on Thursday.
Automakers have been hampered by forces beyond their control for much of the past three years. The pandemic forced them to idle factories for two months in 2020. Then, starting in early 2021, they had to limit production because of the chip shortage.
The shortage has eased, and dealer inventories have improved but remain below normal levels. G.M. said its dealers had 410,000 cars in stock, about half the number before the pandemic.
Many automakers are also struggling to acquire enough batteries for their electric cars and trucks. Some people have been waiting months to buy certain models, like Ford's F-150 Lightning and G.M.'s Hummer pickup trucks.
Many consumers who want to buy new vehicles are also staying away from showrooms because the chip shortage has pushed prices higher. The Fed interest rate increases have also effectively made cars more expensive because many people must borrow money to buy a new vehicle.
According to Edmunds, U.S. consumers on average paid $ 47,681 for new vehicles in November, the most recent month for which data is available. That was a record high and up from $ 45,872 in November 2021. And the average monthly payment on car loans rose in the fourth quarter to $ 717 from $ 659, Ms. Caldwell said.

Suspect in Idaho Killings Got New License Plate Days After Murders: [National Desk]

Full text: Records show the suspect's Hyundai Elantra got a new registration in Washington State shortly after four students at the University of Idaho were murdered.
MOSCOW, Idaho -- The man accused of killing four University of Idaho college students received a new license plate for his car five days after the murders, according to records released Wednesday.
The licensing documents in Washington State show that the vehicle driven by the suspect, Bryan Kohberger, was a white Hyundai Elantra, the type of vehicle that investigators had been seeking in recent weeks.
The police in Moscow had said that a white Hyundai Elantra from between 2011 and 2013 had been seen near the scene of the crimes on the night of the killings in Moscow, Idaho, on Nov. 13. Mr. Kohberger's car was a 2015 model and registered on Nov. 18, according to the licensing document. A vehicle history report shows the car had previously been registered in Pennsylvania, where Mr. Kohberger is from.
Mr. Kohberger, 28, had moved to Pullman, Wash., in recent months and began studying criminology in a Ph.D. program at Washington State University in August. He has said through a lawyer that he expects to be exonerated in the case. Mr. Kohberger's new lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the license plate records.
On Wednesday, the police in Indiana released new body camera footage showing that, two weeks before Mr. Kohberger was arrested, the police there had pulled him over twice in a 10-minute stretch for tailgating. The traffic stops, on Dec. 15, came as Mr. Kohberger was driving across the country with his father for winter break in the same car for which he had obtained the new license plate.
During both stops, the suspect's father mentioned a fatal police standoff that took place that morning near Washington State University, where his son was a student, and told the officer that he and his son had been discussing the "horrifying" incident.
The police shooting that they were discussing does not appear to have any connection to the four fatal stabbings that occurred about a month earlier in Idaho, just across the border from the W.S.U. campus. Mr. Kohberger is now charged with four counts of murder in the stabbings.
Mr. Kohberger was the driver of the car during both stops, and the new footage is the most that the public has seen of him since he became the subject of intense scrutiny after his arrest. On Wednesday, Mr. Kohberger was flown by the police from Pennsylvania, where he was visiting his parents after the road trip, to Idaho, where he stands accused of stabbing four students to death overnight in their home on Nov. 13.
The Pennsylvania State Police plane touched down at the Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport shortly before 6:30 p.m., and Mr. Kohberger was booked into the Latah County Jail in Moscow. Mr. Kohberger's father, Michael Kohberger, visited him in December, and they drove across the country from the W.S.U. campus in Pullman, Wash., to their home in eastern Pennsylvania. During that trip, they were pulled over twice on Dec. 15 for tailgating; in both traffic stops, the officers let the men off with a warning.
There is no indication that the police in Indiana had any idea that Mr. Kohberger would be arrested for the murders, or that they were aware of the police in Moscow, Idaho, saying that a white Hyundai Elantra had been seen near the crime scene on the night of the murders.
During the first stop, at about 10:42 a.m., a deputy with the Hancock County Sheriff's Department pulled Mr. Kohberger and his father over along Interstate 70, just east of Indianapolis. The body camera footage released on Wednesday captured the deputy asking where the two were headed. In response, Mr. Kohberger's father said that they were coming from Washington and had been talking about the police standoff that was unfolding near the Washington State campus that day.
Mr. Kohberger's father told the officer that there had been a "mass shooting." He was corrected by his son, who said, "We don't know if it was a mass shooting," and referred to a SWAT team being called for the standoff. "It's horrifying," Mr. Kohberger's father said in the video. That incident involved a man who the police later said had barricaded himself in an apartment and threatened to kill his roommates before a police officer shot him to death.
At another point in the video, the father said, "We're slightly punchy because we've been driving for hours."
After about three minutes, the deputy said, "Do me a favor and don't follow too close, OK?" and then returned Mr. Kohberger's driver's license and let them go.
Just five minutes later, Mr. Kohberger and his father were pulled over again, this time by an Indiana state trooper who also said that they were tailgating. The audio from the trooper's body camera is obscured by traffic noise, but Mr. Kohberger and his father could be heard telling the officer that they were just stopped minutes earlier. Again, the father brought up the incident that morning at Washington State. The trooper wished them a safe trip and let them go with a warning.
It was two weeks later, on Dec. 30, that the police in Pennsylvania carried out a predawn raid of Mr. Kohberger's parents' home, arresting Mr. Kohberger on suspicion of carrying out the Idaho killings. They also searched his car and executed a warrant to obtain his DNA, officials said. Mr. Kohberger has said through a public defender that he looks forward to being exonerated.
Mr. Kohberger had just completed his first semester at Washington State, which is about a 15-minute drive from the crime scene in Moscow. Classmates said he had shown an interest in the psychology of criminals as well as in forensics.
The murders of the four University of Idaho student victims -- Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20 -- and the arrest of Mr. Kohberger have rattled the neighboring college towns of Moscow and Pullman.
The stabbing took place in the early morning hours at a home along a dead-end street a five-minute walk from campus. The police have said that the victims were most likely asleep when they were attacked, and two more roommates were in the home but apparently slept through the killings.
Friends and relatives of the victims are searching for any connection between the victims and Mr. Kohberger, but so far none has been disclosed.
The police have said that the surviving roommates realized something was wrong only late in the morning and believed that one of their roommates had passed out. They called friends to the home and then someone called 911, after which police officers discovered the grisly scene.

Full text: The 28-year-old Ph.D. student accused in the killings will be taken to Idaho to face four counts of murder after making a brief appearance in a Pennsylvania courtroom.
STROUDSBURG, Pa. -- The graduate criminology student accused of fatally stabbing four University of Idaho students agreed in his first public court appearance on Tuesday to be extradited from Pennsylvania to Idaho to face murder charges.
The student, Bryan Kohberger, 28, was arrested in Eastern Pennsylvania on Friday and charged in the overnight killings of four students at a home in Moscow, Idaho, on Nov. 13. Mr. Kohberger had entered a Ph.D. program in criminology and criminal justice at Washington State University last summer and moved to Pullman, Wash., a 20-minute drive across the border from the scene of a crime that horrified and confounded the region.
At a news conference on Tuesday, officials provided the first detailed account of the pre-dawn arrest of Mr. Kohberger at his parents' home in suburban Monroe County, Pa., during which officers broke down the doors and shattered windows to take him into custody.
They said they had executed search warrants to obtain Mr. Kohberger's D.N.A. as well as to search the home and a white Hyundai Elantra that matched the description of a vehicle seen near the crime scene on the night of the killings.
Maj. Christopher Paris of the Pennsylvania State Police said Mr. Kohberger, whose parents were home at the time of the arrest, surrendered during the raid.
The police have not outlined any motive, and officials in Pennsylvania declined to say on Tuesday whether the suspect had a previous connection to the victims. But the authorities in Idaho were expected to release more details in charging documents once Mr. Kohberger was transferred to that state.
At the extradition hearing, Judge Margherita Patti-Worthington said Mr. Kohberger had to be extradited within 10 days. Major Paris said he hoped to send him to Idaho "as soon as possible," though he said it was unlikely to happen on Tuesday night.
The public defender representing Mr. Kohberger in Pennsylvania, Jason LaBar, has said Mr. Kohberger looks forward to being exonerated.
Mr. Kohberger arrived at the courthouse from jail handcuffed and wearing a red jumpsuit. He did not respond to reporters as they shouted questions, including about whether he had carried out the crime. Mr. LaBar said Mr. Kohberger had told him that he was shocked to be considered a suspect in the slayings.
In court, Mr. Kohberger answered a set of standard questions from the judge and then signed a waiver allowing his extradition. When Judge Patti-Worthington asked him if he was mentally ill or taking any medications that would affect his ability to make a decision, he said that he was not.
A woman in the front row of the courtroom wept as the hearing took place, prompting a sheriff's deputy to bring her tissues.
Michael Mancuso, an assistant district attorney in Monroe County, said afterward that Mr. Kohberger may have agreed to be extradited because of an Idaho law that prohibits the release of an affidavit supporting an arrest warrant until a defendant is in the state.
"I definitely believe that one of the main reasons the defendant chose to waive extradition and hurry his return back to Idaho was to need to know what was in those documents," Mr. Mancuso said.
The affidavit was likely to provide more details about what evidence the authorities had connecting Mr. Kohberger to the crime.
On Tuesday evening, a magistrate judge in Latah County, which includes Moscow, issued an order prohibiting all parties in the proceedings -- including lawyers, police officers and other investigators -- from speaking about the case outside of court, other than to refer to public records.
In response to the order from Judge Megan Marshall, the Moscow police said it would "no longer be communicating with the public or the media regarding this case."
The order lasts until a verdict is reached on the charges or a judge modifies the order.
It also emerged on Tuesday that Mr. Kohberger had been pulled over twice for traffic infractions by police officers in Indiana on Dec. 15, while he was driving his Elantra with his father from Washington State University back to Pennsylvania for the holidays.
Indiana State Police released body camera footage from the second of two stops, which was for following too closely behind a truck. It showed that a state trooper had decided to let Mr. Kohberger and his father go with a warning after learning that a sheriff's deputy had also stopped them a few minutes earlier for speeding. There was no reported connection between the stop and the arrest of Mr. Kohberger two weeks later.
A week before the traffic stops, the police in Moscow, Idaho, had begun urging the public to contact the police if they had any information about a white Elantra in the area of the crime scene. The Indiana State Police said they had no "specific information" about a suspect or license plate that could have helped make the connection.
Mr. LaBar said Mr. Kohberger and his father had decided in August, when the semester began, that they would drive across the country to Pennsylvania together during the winter break.
The four University of Idaho student victims -- Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20 -- were killed in a home near campus where three of them lived. The one male victim, Mr. Chapin, was there visiting his girlfriend, Ms. Kernodle.
Friends and relatives of at least one victim, Ms. Goncalves, have said that they are looking to see if they can find any connections.
"I'm biased, but if he'd got to know my daughter, I think it'd be impossible for you to hurt her," Ms. Goncalves's father, Steve Goncalves, told NewsNation.
Shanon Gray, a lawyer for the Goncalves family, said family members were planning to attend Mr. Kohberger's initial appearance in Idaho and to have a representative at all subsequent hearings in the prosecution.
"They want to look in his eyes and let him know they are there and are going to be there," he said.
Katie Blomgren, who is studying psychology at the University of Idaho and knew Ms. Goncalves and Ms. Mogen since they were all 11, said she was among those struggling to understand the connections, if any, between Mr. Kohberger and the victims.
"I've never seen him or heard of him," said Ms. Blomgren, 21.
The killings took place after a seemingly typical Saturday night of college partying. Ms. Kernodle and Mr. Chapin had gone to a party at his fraternity, while Ms. Mogen and Ms. Goncalves went to a bar in town. In a statement on Twitter on Monday night, the bar where Ms. Mogen and Ms. Goncalves had spent the night, Corner Club, said the suspect "was not and has not been" at the bar before.
All four victims had arrived back at the house by 2 a.m.
Also in the three-story residence were two female roommates who apparently slept through the killings and were not harmed. The police have said that when the roommates awoke the next morning, they called friends over to the house, not knowing of the horrors that had unfolded on the second and third floors, and then someone in the group called 911.
As details about the killing emerged and no suspect was arrested, many University of Idaho students left Moscow early for Thanksgiving break and did not return afterward, choosing instead to take classes online. Those who did return to campus said they were double-checking the locks on their doors and windows and were avoiding going out at night.
The police have said they believe a long knife was used in the killings but that they have not found the murder weapon.
Mr. Kohberger had enrolled in the Washington State program after studying criminology and psychology at DeSales University in Center Valley, Pa., where he had helped with a study about what people thought about and felt while they committed crimes.
Friends of Mr. Kohberger described him as having long been interested in psychology. He had previously worked as a security guard for the Pleasant Valley School District in Pennsylvania, the same district in which he attended high school.

STROUDSBURG, Pa. — The graduate criminology student accused of fatally stabbing four University of Idaho students agreed in his first public court appearance on Tuesday to be extradited from Pennsylvania to Idaho to face murder charges.
The student, Bryan Kohberger, 28, was arrested in eastern Pennsylvania on Friday and charged in the overnight killings of four students at a home in Moscow, Idaho, on Nov. 13.

Full text: The arrest of a graduate student in the murder of four University of Idaho students eased fears but raised a troubling new question: What was the motive?
MOSCOW, Idaho -- About two weeks before four University of Idaho students were found stabbed to death in a home near campus, Bryan Kohberger was sitting in a criminology class at a college just a short drive away, leaning into a conversation about forensics, D.N.A. and other evidence prosecutors use to win convictions.
The 28-year-old graduate student seemed highly engaged in the discussion, a former classmate recalled. It was a subject that had long captivated Mr. Kohberger, who had researched the mind-sets of criminals, studied under a professor in Pennsylvania known for her expertise on serial killers and, for the last few months, pursued a Ph.D. in criminology at Washington State University, about 10 miles from the Idaho crime scene.
Less than two months later, Mr. Kohberger would be the subject of a criminal inquiry, arrested on Friday and charged with the murder of the four Idaho students.
Investigators have yet to outline a motive, but the details emerging about Mr. Kohberger's deep interest in the psychology of criminals has opened another layer of mystery in a case that has traumatized the college town of Moscow, Idaho, and spawned countless theories from people around the country who followed the case in captivated horror.
Mr. Kohberger was taken into custody on Friday at his parents' home in Effort, Pa., and was ordered to appear at an extradition hearing on Tuesday. Jason LaBar, the public defender in Monroe County who is representing him, said Mr. Kohberger had been following the case with interest but was "shocked" to be arrested.
"He looks forward to being exonerated, is what he said," Mr. LaBar said. Mr. Kohberger, he added, would not oppose the effort to return him to Idaho to face the charges. On Sunday, Mr. LaBar issued a statement from Mr. Kohberger's parents and two sisters saying that they "love and support our son and brother" and had cooperated with the police in an effort to "promote his presumption of innocence." They also offered prayers for the victims.
Mr. Kohberger grew up in suburban eastern Pennsylvania, attending Pleasant Valley High School in Brodheadsville, where former classmates and peers recalled that he had an analytical mind but could sometimes be cruel. Thomas Arntz befriended him while riding the school bus around 2009. He said their friendship ended in 2014 after lighthearted "ribbing and jabbing" between friends turned "meanspirited," with Mr. Kohberger sometimes putting him in a headlock hold.
"Over time it just got so, so bad that I just shut down when I was around him," said Mr. Arntz, now 26. "I eventually just had to cut ties with him."
Mr. Kohberger had struggled with a heroin addiction beginning in high school but had seemed to have moved past it in recent years, friends from Pennsylvania said.
Jack Baylis, who became friends with Mr. Kohberger in eighth grade, said Mr. Kohberger had long been fascinated with why people acted the way they did and had seemed to enjoy his job as a security guard for the Pleasant Valley School District, where he worked for several years until 2021.
The last time Mr. Baylis saw Mr. Kohberger was in 2021, when they shot airsoft guns together in the Poconos. At the time, Mr. Baylis said, Mr. Kohberger drove a white Hyundai Elantra, the same model of car that the police in Moscow said had been spotted near the Idaho victims' home on the night of the attacks.
"I pray he's innocent," Mr. Baylis said.
After earning a psychology degree at a community college in 2018, Mr. Kohberger began studying psychology and later criminal justice at DeSales University, a Catholic institution in Center Valley, Pa. There, he studied in part under Katherine Ramsland, a well-known forensic psychologist whose books include "The Mind of a Murderer" and "How to Catch a Killer." She declined to comment.
Mr. Kohberger was a quiet person who liked to work alone but came across as smart, said Brittany Slaven, who took several classes with him at DeSales. She recalled an instance in one of Dr. Ramsland's classes when students were asked to look at photos of a crime scene and figure out what happened; she said Mr. Kohberger was quick to come up with ideas.
He seemed to show a particular interest in crime scenes and serial killers, Ms. Slaven said.
"At the time it seemed as if he was just a curious student, so if his questions felt odd we didn't think much of it because it fit our curriculum," she said.
In a post on Reddit from about seven months ago, a user who identified himself as Bryan Kohberger sought people who had spent time in prison to take a survey about crimes they had committed. The survey listed Mr. Kohberger as a student investigator working with two professors at DeSales, and it asked respondents to describe their "thoughts, emotions and actions from the beginning to end of the crime commission process."
DeSales University said Mr. Kohberger had received a bachelor's degree there in 2020 and earned a master's degree in June 2022. A spokeswoman for the university said the principal investigator on the crime survey -- Michelle A. Bolger, who is listed on the university website as an associate professor -- and her colleagues would not be granting interviews about their experiences working with Mr. Kohberger. The assistant professor listed as the co-principal investigator, Jeffrey E. Clutter, did not respond to numerous messages.
Mr. Kohberger then moved across the country to Pullman, Wash., where he began the fall semester in August in the graduate criminology program at Washington State University, across the state border from the University of Idaho.
Early in the morning of Nov. 13, following a Saturday night of college town parties and a University of Idaho football game, four college students were found stabbed to death in the rental home in Moscow where three of them lived.
Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20, were attacked in at least two separate bedrooms, probably as they slept, according to investigators. The three women lived in the home; Mr. Chapin was spending the night with his girlfriend, Ms. Kernodle.
The brutal nature of the deaths -- the coroner said all four were fatally stabbed with a long knife -- and the lack of any suspect cast a sense of fear across Moscow, a city that had not recorded a homicide in seven years. Students began walking in groups. Residents checked the locks on their doors and windows. A DoorDash driver said she noticed more people were ordering meals delivered to avoid going out after dark. And the police began receiving a wave of calls from nervous residents: a suspicious-looking man, a driver revving an engine, sounds in the night.
Police at both college campuses added security measures, adding patrols and holding self-defense workshops.
At Washington State, Mr. Kohberger was continuing with his studies, his classmates said. B.K. Norton, who was in the same graduate program as Mr. Kohberger, said his quiet, intense demeanor had made some classmates uncomfortable.
Another student said Mr. Kohberger seemed interested in the thought processes of criminals while they committed crimes and less interested in the social factors that might lead people to do so, saying that he believed some people were just bound to break the law. The fellow student, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared that speaking publicly could jeopardize his safety, described Mr. Kohberger as the black sheep of the class, often taking contrarian viewpoints and sometimes getting into arguments with his peers, particularly women.
The classmate recalled one instance in which Mr. Kohberger began explaining a somewhat elementary criminology concept to a fellow doctoral student, who then accused him of "mansplaining." A heated back-and-forth ensued and the doctoral student eventually stormed out of the classroom, he said.
Mr. Kohberger was also a teaching assistant in a criminal law class during the fall semester, said Hayden Stinchfield, 20, one of the students in that class. He said that Mr. Kohberger often cast his eyes down while addressing the students, giving the impression that he was uncomfortable.
Students said Mr. Kohberger had a strong grasp of the subject matter but was a harsh grader, giving extensive critiques of assignments and then defending the lower marks when students complained as a group. Later in the fall, roughly around the time of the killings, Mr. Stinchfield said Mr. Kohberger seemed to start giving better grades, and the assignments that once had his feedback scrawled across every paragraph began coming back clean.
"At a certain point he stopped leaving all the notes," he said.
At the time, a growing team of investigators from local and state agencies, as well as more than 60 agents from the F.B.I., had descended on Moscow. Forensics investigators combed the house for physical evidence, including D.N.A., and searched fruitlessly for a murder weapon.
Officials pleaded for tips and videos, while thousands of internet sleuths around the country suggested an array of people as the likely culprit: a former boyfriend of one of the victims, a man who was with two of the victims when they got a meal from a food truck, two roommates who were in the home when the killings occurred but apparently slept through them.
None of the online discussion groups identified Mr. Kohberger. It is not clear how or whether he knew the victims.
The police had tried to tamp down rumors by ruling out several people as suspects, though accusations were flying so fast that it at times appeared they could not do so quickly enough. They withheld nearly all details of the investigation, raising frustrations and prompting some people, including relatives of the victims, to wonder publicly whether the police were up to the task.
Still, investigators worked through the holidays to process thousands of tips and extensive evidence collected in and around the scene. In announcing Mr. Kohberger's arrest on Friday, Moscow's police chief, James Fry, said investigators had located a white Hyundai Elantra but had not yet found a murder weapon.
Chief Fry looked exhausted and almost tearful as he announced the arrest at a news conference, making it clear that investigators were still looking for tips to help resolve the questions they could not yet answer: Did the suspect act alone? What was the motive?
"Be assured the work is not done," Chief Fry said. "This is just getting started."
The arrest left the members of one Facebook discussion group, with more than 166,000 members, stunned.
"I'm baffled," one woman wrote. "Literally everything we know doesn't make sense."
But it has also brought a sense of relief to many in Idaho.
Ms. Goncalves's family members said through a lawyer that they were "relieved that the authorities have someone in custody, and now the journey through the criminal justice system begins."
Katie Blomgren, who is studying psychology at the University of Idaho, had known Ms. Goncalves and Ms. Mogen since she was 11. She spent her 12th birthday with the two girls in a hotel, and she thinks of them every time she looks down at her shins, where she has two scars from trying to jump from a bathtub onto a bed that night. She said she has struggled to feel closure, even after the arrest of Mr. Kohberger.
"There's relief, in feeling like maybe it's not so scary to live here anymore," said Ms. Blomgren, 21. But while an arrest in the case has brought a sense of relief for many of her fellow students, she said she has struggled to find any peace. "For me, it doesn't erase what happened."

MOSCOW, Idaho — Eleven days before four University of Idaho students were found stabbed to death in a home near campus, Bryan Kohberger was sitting in a criminology class at a college just a short drive away, leaning into a conversation about forensics, DNA and other evidence prosecutors use to win convictions.
The 28-year-old graduate student seemed highly engaged in the discussion, a former classmate recalled. It was a subject that had long captivated Kohberger, who had researched the mindsets of criminals, studied under a professor in Pennsylvania known for her expertise on serial killers and, for the past few months, pursued a doctorate in criminology at Washington State University, about 10 miles from the Idaho crime scene.
Less than two months later, Kohberger would be the subject of a criminal inquiry, arrested Friday and charged with killing the four Idaho students.
Investigators have yet to outline a motive, but the details emerging about Kohberger’s deep interest in the psychology of criminals has opened another layer of mystery in a case that has traumatized the college town of Moscow, Idaho, and spawned countless theories from people nationwide who followed the case in captivated horror.
Kohberger was taken into custody Friday at his parents’ home in Effort, Pennsylvania, and was ordered to appear at an extradition hearing on Tuesday. Jason LaBar, the public defender in Monroe County who is representing him, said Kohberger had been following the case with interest but was “shocked” to be arrested.
“He looks forward to being exonerated, is what he said,” LaBar said. Kohberger, he added, would not oppose the effort to return him to Idaho to face the charges. On Sunday, LaBar issued a statement from Kohberger’s parents and two sisters saying that they “love and support our son and brother” and had cooperated with the police in an effort to “promote his presumption of innocence.” They also offered prayers for the victims.
Kohberger grew up in suburban eastern Pennsylvania, attending Pleasant Valley High School in Brodheadsville, where former classmates and peers recalled that he had an analytical mind but could sometimes be cruel. Thomas Arntz befriended him while riding the school bus around 2009. He said their friendship ended in 2014 after lighthearted “ribbing and jabbing” between friends turned “mean-spirited,” with Kohberger sometimes putting him in a headlock hold.
“Over time it just got so, so bad that I just shut down when I was around him,” said Arntz, now 26. “I eventually just had to cut ties with him.”
Kohberger had struggled with a heroin addiction beginning in high school but had seemed to have moved past it in recent years, friends from Pennsylvania said.
Jack Baylis, who became friends with Kohberger in eighth grade, said Kohberger had long been fascinated with why people acted the way they did and had seemed to enjoy his job as a security guard for the Pleasant Valley School District, where he worked for several years until 2021.
The last time Baylis saw Kohberger was in 2021, when they shot airsoft guns together in the Poconos. At the time, Baylis said, Kohberger drove a white Hyundai Elantra, the same model of car that police in Moscow said had been spotted near the Idaho victims’ home on the night of the attacks.
“I pray he’s innocent,” Baylis said.
After earning a psychology degree at a community college in 2018, Kohberger began studying psychology and later criminal justice at DeSales University, a Catholic institution in Center Valley, Pennsylvania. There, he studied in part under Katherine Ramsland, a well-known forensic psychologist whose books include “The Mind of a Murderer” and “How to Catch a Killer.” She declined to comment.
Kohberger was a quiet person who liked to work alone but came across as smart, said Brittany Slaven, who took several classes with him at DeSales. She recalled an instance in one of Ramsland’s classes when students were asked to look at photos of a crime scene and figure out what happened; she said Kohberger was quick to come up with ideas.
He seemed to show a particular interest in crime scenes and serial killers, Slaven said.
“At the time it seemed as if he was just a curious student, so if his questions felt odd we didn’t think much of it because it fit our curriculum,” she said.
In a post on Reddit from about seven months ago, a user who identified himself as Bryan Kohberger sought people who had spent time in prison to take a survey about crimes they had committed. The survey listed Kohberger as a student investigator working with two professors at DeSales, and it asked respondents to describe their “thoughts, emotions and actions from the beginning to end of the crime commission process.”
DeSales University said Kohberger had received a bachelor’s degree there in 2020 and earned a master’s degree in June 2022. A spokesperson for the university said the principal investigator on the crime survey — Michelle A. Bolger, who is listed on the university website as an associate professor — and her colleagues would not be granting interviews about their experiences working with Kohberger. The assistant professor listed as the co-principal investigator, Jeffrey E. Clutter, did not respond to numerous messages.
Kohberger then moved across the country to Pullman, Washington, where he began the fall semester in August in the graduate criminology program at Washington State University, across the state border from the University of Idaho.
On the morning of Nov. 13, after a Saturday night of college town parties and a University of Idaho football game, four students were found stabbed to death in the rental home in Moscow where three of them lived.
Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20, were attacked in at least two separate bedrooms, probably as they slept, according to investigators. The three women lived in the home; Chapin was spending the night with his girlfriend, Kernodle.
The brutal nature of the deaths — the coroner said all four were fatally stabbed with a long knife — and the lack of any suspect cast a sense of fear across Moscow, a city that had not recorded a homicide in seven years. Students began walking in groups. Residents checked the locks on their doors and windows. A DoorDash driver said she noticed more people were ordering meals delivered to avoid going out after dark. And police began receiving a wave of calls from nervous residents: a suspicious-looking man, a driver revving an engine, sounds in the night.

The classmate recalled one instance in which Kohberger began explaining a somewhat elementary criminology concept to a fellow doctoral student, who then accused him of “mansplaining.” A heated back-and-forth ensued and the doctoral student eventually stormed out of the classroom, leaving behind her laptop and coffee, he said.
Kohberger was also a teaching assistant in a criminal law class during the fall semester, said Hayden Stinchfield, 20, one of the students in that class. He said that Kohberger often cast his eyes down while addressing the students, giving the impression that he was uncomfortable.
