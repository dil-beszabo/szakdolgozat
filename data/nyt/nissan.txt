Full text: The value of a possible merger between Honda and Nissan.
Honda and Nissan are exploring a merger that would create one of the world's largest automakers. The tie-up, valued at $ 50 billion, would be the latest consolidation of car companies aimed at sharing the financial burden of developing electric vehicles.
The Japan-based companies formally agreed last Monday to begin talks on combining their operations, with the goal of completing a merger by August 2026. Honda and Nissan sold a combined total of around seven million vehicles last year, a sum behind only Toyota and Volkswagen.
The talks come as more car companies are looking for creative ways to handle research, production and sales of electric vehicles. Automakers have invested billions in E.V. development, financing those efforts primarily through sales of gasoline and hybrid cars. But those efforts have so far failed to generate a profit.
"Current business models are being upended," Toshihiro Mibe, Honda's chief executive, said at a briefing in Tokyo. "It is not going to take 10 to 20 years for that to happen -- it will come much faster."
Gasoline-powered cars generally remain cheaper and more popular in the United States than electric vehicles, and E.V. sales have slowed in the last year, a trend that may continue if President-elect Donald J. Trump removes federal tax credits for buying and leasing electric vehicles.
Some analysts have argued that the merger is necessary for the two automakers to have enough firepower to compete in an increasingly crowded industry. Yet combining two large global operations is incredibly difficult. Past mergers between big auto companies have often failed to achieve their objectives, and this time could be no different, said Thomas Stallkamp, an automotive consultant based in Michigan.
"You try to put two of them together and you run into a lot of egos and infighting, so it's very, very difficult to make it work," Mr. Stallkamp said.
"Union baristas know their value, and they're not going to accept a proposal that doesn't treat them as true partners."
Lynne Fox, the president of Workers United, the union that represents more than 10,000 Starbucks employees, announcing that a strike had expanded to 300 stores nationwide.
"The 7-hour -- and counting -- adventure of rescheduled and delayed flights has resulted in me spending more of Christmas Eve at the D.F.W. Pizza Hut Bar than with my wife, waiting for me in Tucson."
Desmond Zantua of Queens, stuck at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, after American Airlines grounded flights because of a technical glitch and bad weather.
"They have no authorities whatsoever. They don't control the scope of government. They don't control the size of government."
Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former chief economist under President George W. Bush, on whether Mr. Trump and his allies can meaningfully cut government spending.

Full text: When Cori Harris and Edgar Hayes met at a local supermarket checkout line, she thought he looked like a wizard from "The Lord of the Rings." A mutual crush emerged.
Cori Gail Harris wasn't feeling great this past August when a man who reminded her of a character from "The Lord of the Rings" pushed his cart into her lane at the IGA supermarket.
Ms. Harris, 53, had been a cashier since July at the St. Stephen, S.C., store and was still getting used to the physical demands of the job. "I was standing on my feet for four-hour shifts, and my body could barely handle three hours," she said. But the 6-foot-8 man with the long white beard stacking his groceries on the conveyor belt momentarily distracted her from her aches and pains. "I thought, wow, the Lord just sent me my own Gandalf, the White."
That man, Edgar Lee Hayes, 78, was no wizard, though he acknowledged a magic wand might have come in handy at the time. He, too, had been feeling unwell. And in the 15 years since his wife had died of heart failure, his strategy for finding someone new to date -- "I was waiting for God to drop somebody out of the sky," he said -- hadn't been fruitful. In the space of a few scanned items, he developed a crush on the new cashier.
Ms. Harris is originally from Homer, Mich. She was divorced in 1992 after a brief marriage and has two daughters, ages 36 and 20. Her route to Bonneau Beach, S.C., where she and her younger daughter, Zoey, were living when she started working at IGA, involves a detour through Hazard, Ky. In 2013, she moved there and became financially dependent on a boyfriend. When they broke up in 2020, she returned to Michigan but was unable to find stable work and housing during the pandemic.
"My daughter and I and our two cats were seriously about to go to a homeless shelter," she said. In December 2023, a friend she had never met in person but got to know through the online horse adventure game Star Stable offered to help. "I didn't have a vehicle, and I didn't have any money, but Diane said, 'We're coming to get you."'
Ms. Harris's professional background is in data entry. She had hoped to find clerical work when she and Zoey moved their few possessions into the Bonneau Beach home of Diane and Fred Varvell a year ago. But after the couple returned home from a summer grocery shopping trip and told her IGA was hiring, she applied. Though the work was taxing on her body -- she attributes her discomfort to scoliosis -- it had its rewards.
"I didn't think I was going to like it, but after about two weeks I started getting used to the regular customers," she said. "Everybody's friendly. And I would see miracles every day, like somebody paying someone else's bill because they were a few dollars short."

Mr. Hayes, of St. Stephen, is an Army veteran originally from Charleston, S.C. Before his wife died in 2009, he was divorced from a first wife in 1974. His 13 children range in age from their early 30s to early 50s. He had been retired since 2002 from a career doing mechanical work on trains and at construction sites when he started looking forward to seeing Ms. Harris behind her register this past summer.
"It was her smile, her friendliness," he said.
Ms. Harris had been secretly hoping he might be attracted to her when, on Nov. 5, he steered his cart into her lane and asked if she would consider having lunch with him. Saying yes gave her something to look forward to. But it also sent her into a spiral of worry. She didn't have a car and wasn't sure he would be willing to pick her up from the Varvell home, 15 minutes from the store. That concern was allayed when he offered to wait for her shift to end so he could drive her back to Bonneau Beach and learn the route.
The ride home in his black Nissan Rogue lasted longer than both expected. "Everything about our lives came out in that car ride," she said, including Mr. Hayes's recent lung cancer diagnosis. Outside the Varvell home, they parked and talked for hours. "He let me know he was getting ready to go through treatments all by himself, and he asked me if I would be his companion, because he wasn't sure he would be able to drive after."
By the time she went inside, she had agreed to that and more. "I didn't intend to propose," Mr. Hayes said. "But the way she was telling me what she was looking for in a companion -- I just said, 'Well, if you ever met somebody like that would you consider marrying him?"' Five minutes later, they were engaged. Their first date, at the Watermark Bar and Grill in Bonneau, S.C., came days later.
Ms. Harris had been accompanying Mr. Hayes to his radiation appointments at Trident Medical Center in Charleston several weeks when their plan to marry at Mr. Hayes's brother's house on Dec. 12 started to unravel. He and his first wife had been married by a military chaplain. "So the thought popped into my mind, why not get married by a chaplain at the V. A.?"
Ms. Harris knew Trident had its own chaplain. She suggested they marry there. On Dec. 5, they met with the Rev. DeMett Jenkins, the medical center's director of spiritual care and outreach. The next day, Chrystal Wilson, the director of the cancer center, signed off on a wedding.
On Dec. 12, 40 guests, including doctors and nurses, filed into a waiting room outfitted with a rented arch. Ms. Harris wore a violet dress gifted by a local boutique, Ash and T's Formals; Mr. Hayes wore a gray tuxedo lent by Men's Wearhouse. Robert Sloan, Trident's associate chaplain, officiated a short, religious ceremony followed by a reception with hors d'oeuvres, punch and wedding cake.
Ms. Harris and Zoey, who walked her mother down the aisle, had barely finished moving into Mr. Hayes's house in time for the wedding. But planning hadn't required the bride or groom to do any heavy lifting. "They did everything," she said of the Trident staff. "It was so beautiful. No one could have done it better."
In January, Mr. Hayes will undergo a CT scan to determine whether his cancer treatments have been successful. Regardless of the outcome, he is grateful for the turn his life has taken since meeting Ms. Harris. "This whole thing from Day 1 has felt like a script," he said.

Wall St. Tiptoes Out of a Holiday Pause to a Mixed Close: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stock indexes drifted to a mixed finish on Wall Street Thursday, as some heavyweight technology and communications sector stocks offset gains elsewhere in the market.
The S&P 500 fell less than 0.1 percent after spending the day wavering between small gains and losses. The tiny loss ended the benchmark index's three-day winning streak.
The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.1 percent, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.1 percent.
Trading volume was lighter than usual as U.S. markets reopened after the Christmas holiday.
The semiconductor giant Nvidia, whose enormous valuation gives it an outsize influence on indexes, slipped 0.2 percent.
Meta Platforms fell 0.7 percent, and Amazon and Netflix each fell 0.9 percent.
Tesla was among the biggest decliners in the S&P 500, finishing 1.8 percent lower.
Some tech companies fared better. The chip company Broadcom rose 2.4 percent, Micron Technology added 0.6 percent and Adobe gained 0.5 percent.
Health care stocks were a bright spot. CVS Health rose 1.5 percent and Walgreens Boots Alliance added 5.3 percent for the biggest gain among S&P 500 stocks.
Several retailers also gained ground. Target rose 3 percent, Ross Stores added 2.3 percent, Best Buy rose 2.9 percent and Dollar Tree gained 3.8 percent.
Traders are watching to see whether retailers have a strong holiday season.
The day after Christmas traditionally ranks among the top 10 biggest shopping days of the year, as consumers go online or rush to stores to cash in gift cards and raid bargain bins.
U.S.-listed shares in Honda and Nissan rose 4.1 percent and 16.4 percent, respectively. The Japanese automakers announced earlier this week that the two companies are in talks to combine.
All told, the S&P 500 fell 2.45 points to 6,037.59. The Dow added 28.77 points to 43,325.80. The Nasdaq fell 10.77 points to close at 20,020.36.
Wall Street got a labor market update. U.S. applications for unemployment benefits held steady last week, though continuing claims rose to the highest level in three years, the Labor Department reported.
Treasury yields mostly fell in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 4.58 percent from 4.59 percent late Tuesday.
Major European markets were closed, as well as Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand and Indonesia.
Trading was expected to be subdued this week with a thin slate of economic data on the calendar.
Still, U.S. markets have historically gotten a boost at year's end despite lower trading volumes. The last five trading days of each year, plus the first two in the new year, have brought an average gain of 1.3 percent since 1950.
So far this month, the U.S. stock market has lost some of its gains since President-elect Donald J. Trump's win on Election Day, which raised hopes for faster economic growth and more lax regulations that would boost corporate profits.
Worries have risen that Mr. Trump's preference for tariffs and other policies could lead to higher inflation, a bigger U.S. government debt and difficulties for global trade.
Even so, the U.S. market remains on pace to deliver strong returns for 2024. The benchmark S&P 500 is up 26.6 percent so far this year and remains near its most recent high that was set earlier this month -- its latest of 57 records this year.
Wall Street has several economic reports to look forward to next week, including updates on pending home sales and home prices, a report on U.S. construction spending and snapshots of manufacturing activity.

Carmakers Talking Merger. History Isn't on Their Side.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The Japanese companies are considering joining forces to survive in a rapidly changing auto industry, but auto history is filled with troubled and failed marriages.
The Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan are discussing a possible merger, in a bid to share costs and help themselves compete in a fast-changing and increasingly competitive industry.
But a merger, even of two companies from the same country, is no guarantee of success, and the history of automotive deals is littered with failures and disappointments.
Combining two large, global manufacturing operations is an incredibly difficult feat that involves reconciling different technologies, models and approaches to doing business. A merger's success rests on getting ambitious managers and engineers who have spent decades competing with one another to cooperate. Teams and projects have to be scrapped or changed, and executives must cede power to others. In some cases, the merging companies are hamstrung by elected leaders who force them to keep operating money-losing factories.
Thomas Stallkamp, an automotive consultant based in Michigan, was involved in the struggles of one of the biggest auto mergers, the 1998 merger of Chrysler and the German company Daimler. Mr. Stallkamp spent years in senior roles at Chrysler and DaimlerChrysler.
"Car companies are big, complicated organizations, with large engineering staffs, manufacturing plants all over the world, hundreds of thousands of employees, in a capital-intensive business," Mr. Stallkamp said. "You try to put two of them together and you run into a lot of egos and infighting, so it's very, very difficult to make it work."
Honda and Nissan announced plans this year to work together on electric vehicles, and on Monday they formally began talks about extending that cooperation to a merger that could also include Mitsubishi Motors, a smaller manufacturer that works closely with Nissan. A pairing would unite Japan's second- and third-biggest automakers, after Toyota, and create a company that would be the third largest in the world by number of cars produced, after Toyota and Volkswagen.
The merger discussions were prompted by difficulties the companies are facing around the world.
Chief among those problems is that sales have plummeted in China, the world's largest auto market. Chinese car buyers are moving much more quickly to electric and plug-in hybrid cars and trucks than most industry experts had expected. Honda and Nissan offer few such models, which now account for more than half of all cars sold in China. Companies that are doing the best in the shift away from gasoline cars are domestic manufacturers like BYD and SAIC, as well as Tesla.
Last month, Honda said it expected net profit for the fiscal year ending in March to fall 14 percent, and lowered its forecast for global vehicle sales to 3.8 million from 3.9 million, largely as a result of its difficulties in China, which had once accounted for about a third of its sales.
Nissan has more significant troubles than Honda and in recent years has slogged through management upheaval. In the United States, a critical market where Nissan used to earn significant profits, the company's market share has fallen sharply as it struggles to sell cars and trucks that haven't received significant upgrades in recent years. In the period from April to September, Nissan's operating profit plunged 90 percent, and the automaker recently said it aimed to lose 9,000 employees worldwide and cut global production by about 20 percent.
A merger could help Honda and Nissan develop electric cars faster and at lower cost -- in theory. But other companies have struggled to achieve such gains in practice, often because the priorities of companies working together often shift and diverge. Ford Motor and Volkswagen teamed up a few years ago to work on electric vehicles and autonomous driving technology. But the companies shut down their self-driving car business and reaped few benefits from collaborating on electric vehicles.
Honda had a partnership with General Motors, and currently sells two electric sport utility vehicles, the Honda Prologue and Acura ZDX, that are manufactured by G.M. But the companies have decided not to extend the partnership beyond those two models, and G.M. is now exploring ways to work with Hyundai, the South Korean automaker.
Still, analysts said a merger of Honda and Nissan had the potential to help both companies. In the United States, the two companies have similar product lines focused on small and medium-size cars and sport utility vehicles like Nissan's Sentra, Altima and Rogue and Honda's Civic, Accord and CRV.
Sam Fiorani, a vice president at Auto Forecast Solutions, a research firm, said Nissan had the technology to build full-size pickup trucks bought by many Americans, something Honda lacks. "That's something that could be valuable for Honda in the future," he said.
On the production side, Nissan has two vehicle assembly plants in the United States and Honda has four. Each also has engine and transmission factories and engineering centers.
They could in theory reap savings by combining their operations, closing some plants and locations and eliminating jobs. But that's where the difficulties are likely to arise.
"That means one of the two merger partners is going to gut their development organization or scrap their engine program, and that where you always run into heavy resistance," Mr. Stallkamp said. "When it comes down to it, neither side wants to take the hit."
In many cases, downsizing measures run into political opposition because governments push companies to preserve jobs. Stellantis was formed in a 2021 merger of France's Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler, and the French and Italian governments have fought to keep the combined company from closing factories.
After some initial success, Stellantis this year has suffered a slump in vehicle sales and a drop in profit. The chief executive who helped shepherd the merger, Carlos Tavares, resigned this month. The company, now run by a board committee, is looking for a new top executive and scrapping parts of the strategy it put in place after the merger.
For more than two decades Nissan was the junior partner in an alliance with Renault. The partnership saved Nissan from collapse and helped it become profitable, but neither company saw the kind of long-term success that had been envisioned by Carlos Ghosn, who had led the alliance and served as chief executive of both companies.
Eventually, executives at Nissan chafed at being effectively controlled by Renault. In 2018, Mr. Ghosn was arrested and jailed in Japan on charges of financial wrongdoing. He fled to Lebanon before a trial. Renault still owns a significant stake in Nissan, but the two don't work as closely together as they used to.
DaimlerChrysler faced few battles over closing plants, but struggled to merge a luxury carmaker with an automaker that made more affordable models. The combined company had a balky management structure that included two executives sharing power at the top, and with vast cultural differences between its German and American operations. The two sides separated in 2007 after nine years.
"It was a constant battle of egos on both sides," Mr. Stallkamp said.
Other partnerships that proved disappointing include BMW's takeover of Britain's Rover in the 1990s. Ford owned all or part of Jaguar Land Rover, Mazda and Volvo but sold those assets during and after the 2008 financial crisis.
A few automotive mergers have seemed to live up to expectations. Fiat Chrysler -- formed when Fiat, an Italian automaker, took over Chrysler as the American company was emerging from bankruptcy -- is one example of a merger that seemed to flourish. Under its chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, the Chrysler part of the business, which also included the Dodge, Jeep and Ram brands, recovered and became the more profitable half of the combined company.
The South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia, which have been in an alliance since 1998, are together one of the world's largest automakers and have enjoyed strong growth in recent years. They share development, engineering and manufacturing resources, but have separate sales and marketing operations.
Marc Cannon, a consultant who was a senior executive at AutoNation, a large automotive retailer, said Honda and Nissan could try to emulate Hyundai and Kia, but he expressed doubts about how well the Japanese companies would fare.
"Honda is still a great brand with great products. Nissan's brand has been damaged with all the turmoil they've had in the last few years, and their quality is not great," Mr. Cannon said. "So it doesn't make that much sense to me. Why would Honda be interested in taking on Nissan's problems?"

After Bumpy Day of Trading, Markets End on an Upswing: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Stocks shook off a choppy start to finish higher Monday, as Wall Street kicked off a holiday-shortened week.
The S&P 500 ended 0.7 percent higher after having been down 0.5 percent in the early going. The Dow Jones industrial average also recovered from an early slide to eke out a 0.2 percent gain. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite rose 1 percent.
Gains in technology and communications stocks accounted for much of the gains, outweighing losses in consumer goods companies and elsewhere in the market.
The semiconductor giant Nvidia, whose enormous valuation gives it an outsize influence on indexes, rose 3.7 percent. Broadcom climbed 5.5 percent to also help support the broader market.
Walmart fell 2 percent and PepsiCo slid 1 percent.
The Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan said they were talking about combining in a deal that might also include Mitsubishi Motors. U.S.-listed shares in Honda jumped 12.7 percent, while Nissan ended flat.
Eli Lilly rose 3.7 percent after announcing that regulators approved Zepbound as the first and only prescription medicine for adults with sleep apnea.
The department store Nordstrom fell 1.5 percent after it agreed to be taken private by Nordstrom family members and a Mexican retail group in a $ 6.25 billion deal.
All told, the S&P 500 rose 43.22 points to 5,974.07. The Dow gained 66.69 points to 42,906.95. The Nasdaq rose 192.29 points to 19,764.89.
Traders got a look at new snapshot of U.S. consumer confidence Monday. The Conference Board said that consumer confidence slipped in December. Its consumer confidence index fell back to 104.7 from 112.8 in November. Wall Street was expecting a reading of 113.8.
The unexpectedly weak consumer confidence update follows several generally strong economic reports last week. One report showed the overall economy grew at a 3.1 percent annualized rate during the summer, faster than earlier thought. The latest report on unemployment benefit applications showed that the job market remains solid.
A report on Friday said a measure of inflation the Federal Reserve likes to use was slightly lower last month than economists expected. Worries about inflation edging higher again had been weighing on Wall Street and the Fed.
The central bank just delivered its third cut to interest rates this year, but inflation has been hovering stubbornly above its target of 2 percent. It has signaled that it could deliver fewer cuts to interest rates next year than it earlier anticipated because of concerns over inflation.
Expectations for more interest rate cuts have helped drive a roughly 25 percent gain for the S&P 500 in 2024. That drive included 57 highs this year.
Inflation concerns have added to uncertainties heading into 2025, which include the labor market's path ahead and shifting economic policies under an incoming President Donald J. Trump.
"Put simply, much of the strong market performance prior to last week was driven by expectations that a best-case scenario was the base case for 2025," said Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company.
Treasury yields rose in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.59 percent from 4.53 percent late Friday.
European markets closed mostly lower, while markets in Asia gained ground.
Wall Street has several other economic reports to look forward to this week. On Tuesday, the U.S. will release its November report for sales of newly constructed homes. A weekly update on unemployment benefits is expected on Thursday.
Markets in the U.S. will close at 1 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday for Christmas Eve and will remain closed on Wednesday for Christmas.

Full text: Japan's second- and third-largest automakers hope the $ 50 billion deal would help them catch up with Tesla and China's BYD in electric vehicles and advanced software.
Honda Motor and Nissan Motor are exploring a merger to create one of the world's largest auto groups as they seek to better position themselves for the expensive technological transition reshaping the automotive industry.
On Monday, Honda and Nissan signed a memorandum of understanding to formally begin talks aimed at deepening a partnership that began this year. Over the next six months, the companies will discuss combining their operations under a holding company, with the goal of completing the merger in August 2026.
Honda and Nissan, Japan's second- and third-largest automakers, would join a growing number of legacy auto giants, including General Motors and Volkswagen, that are deepening ties to share the financial burden of developing next-generation vehicles. The deal is seen as a lifeline in particular for Nissan, which has been slashing jobs and production amid faltering sales.
Unlike the gasoline-powered cars that have defined the industry for most of the past century, more vehicles today are being equipped with batteries, electric motors and advanced software that enables features such as autonomous driving.
To navigate the change, Honda and Nissan have decided they can better handle research and development and new investments as a combined force, Honda's chief executive, Toshihiro Mibe, said at a briefing in Tokyo on Monday.
"Current business models are being upended. It is not going to take 10 to 20 years for that to happen -- it will come much faster," Mr. Mibe said. "We need to have the right artillery in order to be competitive on that battlefield so we're starting today."
In recent years, automakers across Japan, the United States and Europe have invested billions of dollars into electric vehicle development -- efforts that, for the most part, have yet to generate profits. These investments are being financed by sales of higher-margin gasoline and hybrid models, which also require continuous investment.
With electric vehicle sales growth slowing and President-elect Donald J. Trump gearing up to eliminate E.V. tax incentives in the United States, automakers must figure out how to sustain investments in gasoline- and battery-powered cars for an extended period, said Takaki Nakanishi, head of the automotive consulting firm Nakanishi Research Institute in Tokyo.
"To sustain these dual investments, automakers need scale and the operational efficiencies that come with it," Mr. Nakanishi said. "If Nissan and Honda are not able to achieve this, they will not survive," he said. "Times are truly that tough."
Nissan sells more than three million vehicles a year, while Honda sells nearly four million. A merger would position them as the world's third-largest automaker group, behind Toyota, whose brands sold 11 million vehicles last year, and Volkswagen, which sold nine million. Honda and Nissan together employ about 325,000 people.
Nissan and Honda said integrating their businesses would enable them to standardize the basic makeup of vehicles and increase production. Those steps would reduce how much each company spent on developing vehicles, freeing up cash to spend on things like creating new software.
The key question is whether even large, combined entities like Honda and Nissan can keep up with newer competitors. The American company Tesla and China's BYD have already established a commanding lead in electric vehicles and car technologies that can be updated over the air like smartphones.
Automotive mergers have a long history of failing to meet expectations and ultimately falling apart. DaimlerChrysler split after nine years of a mostly unhappy marriage. Stellantis was formed in the 2021 merger of Fiat Chrysler and the French PSA Group, and the chief executive who helped engineer the pairing, Carlos Tavares, resigned under pressure this month.
Last year, Nissan and its longtime French partner, Renault, agreed to take steps to unwind their alliance. Around the same time, Honda and G.M. decided to scrap a plan to develop a line of lower-priced electric vehicles, less than two years after the companies announced the joint effort.
The new parent company of a merged Honda and Nissan would be listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Honda would nominate a majority of the new company's directors, from among which a president would be selected. Mitsubishi Motors, a smaller Japanese automaker and longtime partner of Nissan's, said it would also consider joining the new group.
Under the automakers' current market valuations, the combination would be worth more than $ 50 billion.
The deal is part of a wave of consolidation, which some argue is long overdue, in the Japanese car industry. This year, there has been $ 10 billion in mergers and acquisitions in the sector, up 163 percent from a year earlier, according to Mergermarket, a data provider.
Even with expanded scale, the Japanese automakers would need to prove that their partnership could speed their development of new vehicles, said Tang Jin, a senior researcher at Mizuho Bank. If they cannot create some kind of "chemical reaction" of new value by coming together, he said, "their merging will simply become a gathering of the weak."
Already in China, the world's largest car market, it may be too late for Honda, Nissan and many Western automakers to make up ground lost to cost-competitive and technologically advanced local rivals. For the fiscal year ending March 31, Nissan has projected a 13 percent drop in its sales in China, while Honda expects an even steeper decline.
Nissan's struggles in China contributed to a 90 percent plunge in its operating profit to $ 214 million during the first half of the current fiscal year. Last month, Nissan said it would make deep cuts to its global operations, and in the weeks since, it has been circled by a number of groups including activist investors.
Compared with Nissan, Honda's financial position remains healthy. Honda turned a $ 1.8 billion profit in the July-to-September quarter, but that was down 15 percent from a year earlier because of higher research-and-development costs and weak sales in China.
"Nissan's current decline could very well be Honda's tomorrow," said Mr. Nakanishi, the industry consultant. That is something Honda recognizes. "It realizes its best shot is to combine with Nissan, share a common destiny and try to overcome the impending crisis together," he said.

Readers Take On and Resolve Travel Woes: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: You don't always need professional help to make things right after a travel snafu. Here are four ways readers got refunds and resolutions on their own.
Dear Tripped Up,
Who needs you? After we first connected, you said you'd take on my problem. But while you dawdled working on other travelers' issues, I got my money back from that dastardly airline/travel site/car rental agency on my own. Sam Q. Traveler, Everywhere
Dear Readers,
Sam is right. If you are wowed by my knack for getting answers and squeezing refunds out of airlines, hotels and other travel providers, temper your reaction slightly. It's the "nytimes.com" part of my email address that does most of the work, an incantation that bypasses the exasperating mess of online bots, interactive phone menus ("Representative!!!!") and frontline customer-service agents. Instead, I'm connected with a usually attentive media relations department.
What's more impressive, really, is the number of readers who manage to resolve big travel frustrations without a big name or an influential email address. Roughly a third of readers I initially offer to help no longer need me by the time their issue gets to the front of the line.
So for my final column of 2024, I will share four strategies from do-it-yourselfers who found successful ways to get their cases in front of a sympathetic eyes and ears and receive recourse.
1. The government can be of service
A modest request to the incoming Trump administration: Please retain the U.S. Transportation Department's surprisingly simple air travel service complaint form -- and the federal workers who read the submissions -- as the resource helped many readers this year, including Asa of Minneapolis.
Asa and his family traveled to Europe for a ski vacation in February, flying Delta and KLM, but their luggage was delayed. Without winter clothes and ski equipment, the family, Asa said, bought only the basics and rented what they could, but in the pricey ski town of Andermatt, Switzerland, they still spent $ 5,200. The family meticulously saved itemized receipts and submitted them to KLM. (The airline that flies the final leg is the point of contact for lost luggage, according to the Montreal Convention, an international treaty governing lost luggage on most international flights.)
KLM sent Asa $ 864, with no explanation. He then researched the Montreal Convention himself and found that airlines were required to reimburse reasonable expenses up to about $ 1,700 per traveler. He filed two new claims to KLM, complained to the Department of Transportation online and, in May, wrote to me.
I said I would help, but it might take a while. "Sounds great," he wrote. "In the meantime, I'll continue being a thorn in the side of KLM!"
He wouldn't need to be. Days later, on June 2, he got an email from KLM acknowledging his complaint with the Transportation Department and asking for him to resubmit the receipts and provide his bank account information. Though he would have to submit them several more times, he received the full amount -- the remainder of the $ 5,200, minus $ 864 already received -- on June 18.
Jasper Koek, a spokesman for the airline, wrote to me: "KLM sincerely apologizes for the inconvenience caused by the delayed arrival of the family's luggage and the time it took to resolve the issue. We are committed to ensuring that our customers receive the best possible service, and we regret that this situation did not meet our usual standards."
The online form from the Transportation Department, a federal agency, only works for airline issues. But I have also heard from readers who successfully complained to state attorneys general (in their home state, not the business's state) and state insurance departments, for travel insurance claims.
2. Use the "chargeback" option after a credit-card purchase
When Kemi of Brooklyn never received a refund from Booking.com after canceling a $ 1,260 flight to Africa, she got the site's attention by filing a "chargeback," or asking her credit card issuer to return the money.
This is a risky move, so first, some words of advice about this approach: Be sure the rules are on your side.
For snafus over smaller-ticket items, companies often give up without a fight, deciding not to contest the chargeback. But with more costly disputes, they may fight back and win, especially if the consumer's case is not well documented. Companies have also been known to blacklist customers or, as I wrote about in August, find other ways to make customers' lives miserable.
But the strategy worked for Kemi, because she was right. Through Booking.com, she had reserved an EgyptAir flight from New York to Abuja, Nigeria, on March 27. But on March 14, EgyptAir pushed her flight back a day, a scheduling change that didn't work for her.
As was very clearly her right, she requested a refund and booked a new and more expensive flight with United Airlines. She was regularly in touch with Booking.com, which told her it had requested the refund from EgyptAir, to no avail.
So about a month later she called her credit card issuer, which tentatively refunded the charge and, by June 22, finalized the dispute in her favor.
Sage Hunter, a spokeswoman for Booking.com, confirmed the story and said the agency did eventually get the money back from the airline. EgyptAir did not respond to my questions.
3. File a small-claims-court case
Note: I didn't say, "Go to small claims court." This year, several readers got in touch with me to share that simply filing cases led to their receiving a response and eventually a resolution from the company.
Zlati of Brooklyn shared that her daughter tried to cancel a $ 4,575 reservation within 24 hours of purchase on the website for TAP Air Portugal, but she could not get the website to process the refund, which is required by law.
Zlati filed a case in Essex County, N.J., where TAP's U.S. operations are based. After some back and forth, the airline did not accept fault but paid the family back (plus $ 42 in court fees!) on the condition that the case was dismissed. At least three other readers had similar success with other airlines.
In a way, that's surprising, because TAP and the others almost certainly could have won the case had the carriers showed up in court, thanks to the federal Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, which pre-empts state consumer laws on airline pricing and services. Ganesh Sitaraman, a law professor at Vanderbilt University and the author of "Why Flying Is Miserable and How to Fix It," said that the Supreme Court has interpreted that legislation's oversight "expansively," meaning small-claims courts are the wrong venues to fight the airlines.
For Zlati, however, it still worked. My best guess is that TAP opted to settle rather than pay for a lawyer to sit for hours in an obscure county courtroom. (TAP did not respond to my request for comment.)
And remember, the federal deregulation law applies only to airlines. Barbara from Florida sued Greyhound in small-claims court, after an incorrect address on her $ 26 ticket led her to miss a bus. She won a default judgment, and she said Greyhound paid her $ 500. (The bus line did not respond to my request for comment.)
4. Follow up, persistently and politely
Adam of Los Angeles didn't need to go to court when Dollar charged him $ 495 for a vehicle upgrade he did not agree to. Instead he used the most common and easiest way to fight a case: persistently following up, politely but firmly, on multiple fronts.
Adam rented a Nissan Rogue in Boston in March for what he thought would be a total of $ 583. But when the bill came, it was for $ 1,201, which included $ 495, plus tax, for a "vehicle upgrade," in this case from a "Jeep Compass or similar."
He said he did not agree to the upgrade, and I believe him, in part because that is a crazy amount to pay for a slightly roomier S.U.V., but mostly because he kept the printed, highlighted rental agreement that listed his total estimated charges as $ 583, no upgrade mentioned.
He filed a complaint via the Dollar website and was told he would receive a refund. But a few days later he received an email reversing the decision from a worker who attached an image of an electronic agreement that included the $ 495 charge.
But Adam just replied with a copy of his receipt. "No upgrade was discussed or agreed to," he wrote (politely but firmly). "Please refund the upgrade charge of $ 495 immediately."
The next day he filed a separate complaint via direct message on X to @DollarCars. That, too, was denied for the same reason.
He also wrote to me, but before I could get on the case, Dollar refunded him.
There was more he could have done if that hadn't worked. Adam could have searched for other contacts at Dollar, which would have revealed it is owned by Hertz, another avenue to complain. (A spokeswoman for Hertz said she was "glad it has already been resolved.")
There is a catch to all these strategies: You have to be right. So as you set out on your 2025 adventures, keep in mind that not every travel problem qualifies for a refund or compensation. But document everything for those that do.
If you need advice about a best-laid travel plan that went awry, send an email to TrippedUp@nytimes.com.

Europe Has No Strategy To Combat Tariff Threat: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The incoming president promised "tariffs all the way" unless Europe bought more U.S. oil and gas. European officials have no clear strategy for avoiding a trade war.
President-elect Donald J. Trump's threats of tariffs on allies and adversaries alike have unsettled companies and governments across Europe, setting off a scramble for what they fear could be a trans-Atlantic trade war.
Their nascent plans, including a closely guarded effort at the top levels of the European Commission, appear to be more proactive than what they were the first time Mr. Trump took office. But any attempt to form a united front on trade could be hampered by the sclerotic politics across much of Europe.
The French and German governments both collapsed this month. Austria and Belgium are struggling to form governing coalitions long after their most recent elections.
And no clear consensus has emerged on how to respond to whatever Mr. Trump might have in store. Divisions are already emerging between officials who favor a strategy of retaliation if he tries to impose new taxes on European exports and those who favor negotiation.
In a post on Truth Social early Friday, Mr. Trump said he had "told the European Union that they must make up their tremendous deficit with the United States by the large scale purchase of our oil and gas. Otherwise, it is TARIFFS all the way!!!"
Economists warn that trade wars generally hurt all parties involved, clogging the exchange of goods and services and reducing economic growth. But the weakness of Europe's economy since the start of the pandemic -- and the political turmoil -- could leave it particularly vulnerable to damage now.
In this year's presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said he would impose a new tax of 10 or 20 percent on all imports to the United States, regardless of their origin. Along with the vague threats to target Europe on Friday, he also issued direct warnings for Mexico, Canada, China and several emerging-market countries since his election.
Any such tariffs would endanger what is effectively the largest trading relationship for both the United States and the European Union, which traded more than $ 1.5 trillion in goods and services in 2023. Last year, the United States had a trade deficit with Europe, importing slightly more from the countries than it exported to them. Europe is already one of the biggest buyers of liquefied natural gas from the United States, which is the world's largest supplier.
During the first Trump administration, Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum from European countries, pledging to reduce the trade deficit. Instead, the gap grew.
As Mr. Trump threatens new tariffs around the world, executives and political leaders across Europe also worry about absorbing aftershocks of any escalation in trade tensions between the United States and China. Those could divert a wave of low-cost exports from U.S. stores to those in Europe.
Officials in Brussels and national Parliaments are beginning to brainstorm possible retaliation or alternate strategies that do not involve taxing Americans.
The early effort within the European Commission, the administrative arm of the European Union, includes analyses of what impact certain tariffs would have on different European countries and sectors, according to a senior European diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity given the political sensitivity of the conversation. The group is discussing what American products to potentially target for tariffs in retaliation.
But the discussions are preliminary, as are similar preparations in Berlin and elsewhere. That's largely because Mr. Trump's trade plans remain opaque.
European Commission trade officials have not communicated with member states about a possible response, in part out of fear of appearing to want to proactively impose tariffs on America, said three European diplomats who spoke on the condition of anonymity given the sensitivities.
One theory is that the European Commission could act as it did during the first Trump administration in 2018, when it implemented retaliatory tariffs on $ 3.2 billion of goods made by companies in areas where Mr. Trump had strong support. That included tariffs on motorcycles by Harley-Davidson, based in Wisconsin, and on other products including bourbon, playing cards and orange juice.
Ignacio García Bercero, a former trade director at the European Commission, said officials should offer to increase imports from the United States, especially in energy and defense, as part of negotiations with Mr. Trump to avoid tariffs. At the same time, the European Union also needs to be ready to implement retaliatory tariffs.
"Any strategy needs to include both elements," said Mr. García Bercero, a fellow at Bruegel, a research firm in Brussels. "Otherwise we would not be credible in a negotiation."
European officials have already floated a plan to increase imports from the United States, including of liquefied natural gas, to placate Mr. Trump. Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank, suggested a similar move in late November and warned against retaliatory tariffs.
Another idea is to appeal directly to Mr. Trump's top team about how European companies have U.S. factories and to explain how any tariffs could force them to shrink their U.S. workforces, said two European diplomats speaking on the condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the subject matter. Although German officials and business leaders tried that approach during Mr. Trump's first administration, it did very little to protect them from his tariffs.
European companies are already weighing whether to shift production or parts of their supply chain, while pressing for a continental response to kick-start their competitiveness.
Patrick Martin, the president of Medef, France's biggest business trade group, said that French exporters were looking at ways to protect themselves from higher tariffs that could make it harder to compete in America or with Chinese rivals.
"We are obviously not indifferent to the announcements of Donald Trump and his team," he said. "Europe must not bow down but assert its power and capabilities."
Mr. Martin said that the reaction of French companies to tariffs would differ depending on their sector and size. Thirty-eight of the largest 40 French companies have production facilities in both Mexico and the United States, including automakers like Stellantis and Renault-Nissan, the cosmetics giant L'Oréal and the Danone food group. Some could try to shift production to the United States, a move that would dovetail with Mr. Trump's stated goal for tariffs.
The French company Airbus, the largest commercial airplane manufacturer, which has a plant in South Carolina and works with suppliers in Mexico, said last month that it would pass along any new tariff costs to its airline customers.
Others in France, such as producers of Burgundy wine, can't move production to the United States and will bear the brunt of any tariffs, Mr. Martin said.
Christian Diemer, a top official of the German trade group BDI who owns a business making special screws in Ohio and in Europe, said that he was more concerned about American tariffs on China. If U.S. tariffs pushed a new wave of Chinese products toward Europe, it would further hurt European companies already struggling with energy prices that are two or three times as high as they are in the United States, he said.
Some executives are betting that a strong U.S. dollar would offset the impact of tariffs on European goods. When the dollar's value is high compared with other currencies, Americans are able to buy more easily imported goods, which effectively become cheaper.
Others are hoping that if Mr. Trump imposes tariffs, they may be able to negotiate exemptions.
Mostly, business groups are warning their members to brace for what could be ahead.
"Companies need to be proactive and run through different scenarios for their business planning -- now," the Chamber of Commerce and Industry for Munich and Upper Bavaria, in Germany, recently told its members.

Excommunicated Nuns Plan to Stay Put: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: The Poor Clares of Belorado, in northern Spain, are digging in their heels in a battle of wills over real estate with the Catholic Church.
One afternoon this past summer, a car sped out of the gates of a convent on the outskirts of a sleepy village in northern Spain and kept going until it reached another convent 85 miles away.
Behind the wheel was a nun. In the passenger's seat was another nun. They sprinted in the white Nissan along a country road lined with sunflower fields and wooden telegraph poles -- desperate to save the way of life of their order, the Poor Clares of Belorado, which has been around since 1358, and to retain control of their three convents.
The Vatican had excommunicated the sisters and a local archbishop had threatened them with eviction because they had broken with the Roman Catholic Church. And though the Poor Clares of Belorado own two of the buildings they live in and had recently signed an agreement to buy a third, the Vatican had appointed a local archbishop to administer their properties and finances.
The frenzied car trip came after the nuns heard that the archbishop was planning to seize spare keys from janitors and change the locks on two of the convents. "They drove like fury," said Sister María Belén de la Trinidad, 51. By the time the two nuns reached the convent called the Derio, the lock on the front door had been changed and the other doors bolted from the inside. The nuns found an open back door, sneaked in and regained access.
Sister Belén and several other nuns are now effectively squatters -- they are cloistered inside the two convents, known as the Orduña and the Belorado. The Derio convent has been empty since the sisters moved out following years of what they describe as persecution by "the devil."
The unusual dispute, now tangled in a Spanish court, has involved a search warrant for a mysterious gun -- plus demons, debts, a mortgage and a manifesto in which the nuns denounced the Catholic Church. The saga has gripped local residents and called into question who actually controls the convents: the sisters or the Vatican?
"They have taken our bank accounts and want to take our properties, land and donations, too," said Sister Belén, who entered the order of the Poor Clares at Belorado in 1999. "It's very hard. But we have to fight."
The Vatican did not respond to requests for comment. Natxo de Gamón, director of communications for the Archbishop of Burgos, disputed the nuns' claims that they are the rightful custodians of the convents and contested many of their recollections of events.
Secluded, most nuns, including Mother Isabel de la Trinidad, the Abbess of the Belorado order, could not be reached or declined to comment. Sister Belén and Sister Paloma Clara María de Jesús agreed to talk to The New York Times and described themselves as spokeswomen for the excommunicated nuns.
Dressed in their habits, they responded to questions through a grille that transects the Belorado convent's reception parlor. They explained how, until recently, they had always observed their vows of obedience. Their break with hierarchy, they say, was sparked by a lack of support during a prolonged period of financial and spiritual hardship.
"The Poor Clares of Belorado have lived here for seven hundred years," Sister Belén said. In recent years, they've remedied crumbling conditions and survived, in their view, demonic possessions. So no matter what the Pope might say, the sisters intend to stay where they are.
The 'Devil' and Derio
According to the nuns, their problems began about 13 years ago. At that time, the Belorado nuns were well respected in the area and by the church. They were known for their industriousness: They had set up a lucrative online chocolate truffle workshop at the Belorado convent, selling gift-wrapped sweets to customers as far away as Japan. Proceeds had been used at the turn of the century to finance the restoration of cells on Belorado's first floor, in a state of disrepair after decades of neglect.
Nearby, in 2011, a handful of elderly nuns were struggling in the smaller, lesser-known Derio convent. The Most Rev. Mario Iceta, now the Archbishop of Burgos, asked the Belorado nuns to incorporate Derio within the Belorado order and help their less fortunate peers, Sister Belén recalled.
The idea was that the nuns could turn the Derio -- a convent built in the 20th century in a stunning natural enclave -- into a spiritual hub, offering board and lodging to religious tourists and attracting generous donations. Mother Isabel de la Trinidad, the Abbess of the Belorado order, dispatched some of the younger nuns, but on arrival at Derio, they found damp walls and rooms infested with insects.
The young sisters sent to the Derio had misgivings from the outset. In a written statement to The Times, the nuns said, "There was something strange in the place, something unsettling."
Regardless, they set to work, drawing on funds from the prosperous Belorado convent and hiring builders to overhaul Derio's church. They installed heating under the floor of the church and fixed up rooms in a separate outbuilding that dates to the 17th century.
But by 2017, Derio had failed to attract worshipers -- and the donations -- they had hoped for. The Belorado convent was financially drained, and the nuns who had been sent to Derio were physically and mentally exhausted.
According to Sister Paloma, they began to fall sick. Squabbles broke out. At night, she said, they heard inexplicable sounds -- objects being dragged across the roof, babies crying, dismal laughter, footsteps coming and going. Door handles turned with an invisible force. Lights went on and off. Items, such as scissors, moved across tables on their own accord. The nuns were convinced evil was at work.
"When you have come face to face with the devil, you know who you are dealing with," said Sister Paloma, 47. "I was very afraid."
The priest at Derio did not provide adequate spiritual guidance, Sister Paloma said. "He celebrated terrible modernist masses," she said. He gave sermons on "ecology and climate change," rather than focusing on "saving souls," she said.
Sister Belén said exorcisms were attempted in 2018; Mr. de Gamón said he personally had no knowledge of any exorcisms.
The strange happenings continued, she said, but the nuns continued to try to save the Derio. They found financial reprieve when the local town council granted them permission to rent out the convent's 17th-century outbuilding as a six-bedroom holiday home for tourists. Before long, they had a steady flow of paying guests.
"Things were going really well," Sister Paloma said. "We nearly always had a rating of nine out of 10 on Booking.com."
Then the pandemic hit, everything closed down. In October 2020, the nuns abandoned the Derio convent. "The preternatural experiences we sustained over time made us make the decision to leave, after consulting three exorcists," they claim in their written statement.
Out of money and increasingly at odds with the Vatican, Mother Isabel, the Abbess, and her nuns took out a mortgage of €720,000 ( $ 752,000) on the Derio convent and put it on the market. They used €100,000 of the loan for a down payment on an empty medieval property 60 miles north of Belorado -- the Orduña convent, which was being sold by another nun community, the Poor Clares of Vitoria. Although convents in Spain belong to the nuns, any sales require authorization from the Vatican, according to Mr. de Gamón.
"The Holy See has the last word," Mr. de Gamón said. The Orduña transaction was approved, and the nuns signed a good faith agreement: The Belorado nuns would make regular payments to the Vitoria nuns until the total value of €1.2 million ( $ 1.3 million) was reached.
The nuns began to recover from their illnesses. Orduña has a vegetable garden and a farmyard, which they tended. Within months, the nuns had used the remaining mortgage money to patch the leaky roof, install solar panels and build a bakery, where they made treats to sell at local markets.
But with an increase in the global price of cocoa, their truffle business was floundering and the profits from their cakes, fritters and pies sold at local markets was all the income they had. "Priests have salaries, but nuns do not. Nuns need to work," said Sister Paloma. "Our way of life is work."
Struggling to keep up with mortgage payments and their commitments to the Poor Clares of Vitoria, they put hope in selling the Derio convent. In late 2023 when a prospective buyer finally showed an interest, they say, they asked the Vatican to authorize the sale. The request went unanswered, according to Sister Belén.
The sisters made one last attempt to improve their finances by negotiating the transfer of ownership of Orduña to a benefactor, whose identity they declined to disclose to The Times. Their proposal was rejected by the local archbishop.
Mr. de Gamón said local church officials found the nuns' claims that they had potential suitors for a Derio purchase and an Orduña transfer to be dubious. In fact, "we have a suspicion that there was no buyer" for the Derio and that the Orduña benefactor was "not Catholic."
The nuns had hit a financial wall. When the Vatican assigned the Archbishop to handle their finances, "a huge economic black hole," which ran into tens of thousands of euros, was discovered, Mr. de Gamón said.
In May, the Poor Clares of Vitoria, who say they have received no payments for the Orduña, demanded it be returned to them. The Belorado nuns, however, refused to sign the cancellation of the good faith agreement, claiming they had spent more than $ 1.2 million euros fixing up a derelict property. "We couldn't sign the cancellation of the contract and lose everything," said Sister María Sión de la Trinidad, 39, a Belorado nun who attended a negotiation meeting.
Days later, the Belorado nuns published their manifesto.
The Nuns Won't Run or Repent
Sixteen nuns renounced the Catholic Church and accused Pope Francis of "usurping the Holy See." They pledged their allegiance instead to a traditionalist Catholic movement called Sedevacantism, which rejects modernism and claims that all popes since Pius XII, who died in 1958, are illegitimate. The forces aligned against them, they wrote, "cannot do anything against the soul."
As the nuns doubled down this summer, they were criticized and mocked in local media. Articles circulated that they had been brainwashed by a fascist priest who had been excommunicated in 2019 and is an open admirer of Spain's former dictator, General Francisco Franco. Sister Belén told The Times that they had turned to him for spiritual counsel in the weeks leading up to their break from the church, but they have since distanced themselves because he is too extreme. "He wanted us to pray on our knees," she said.
Reports about the nuns' excess spending on luxury items, such as silk sheets and cured hams, also appeared in local media. (Sisters Belén and Paloma deny making such expenditures.)
The order was also dealing with defections. One of the nuns broke from the rebellion, telling a local newspaper that she "had to leave, to avoid being a part of that cult." A local judge signed a warrant to check the Belorado convent for a gun rumored to be kept by Mother Isabel in her cell. (The Times viewed the warrant.) The Civil Guard police force declined to respond to multiple requests for comment, but Sister Belén told The Times that the only weapon found was an ancient air rifle that was too rusty to load.
In June, the remaining 15 nuns failed to appear at a meeting before a church tribunal, so the Vatican excommunicated 10 of them, including Mother Isabel and Sisters Paloma and Belén.
The five oldest nuns were spared punishment, deemed too cognitively impaired to have signed the manifesto, according to Mr. de Gamón. "Their family members have told us they want to remain within the Catholic church," he said.
The senior nuns live in the Belorado with Mother Isabel, Sisters Paloma and Belén and three other expellees. Two other excommunicated nuns stay at the Orduña.
Florentino Alaez, a lawyer who is representing the nuns, believes they have a case to stay put. While individual nuns must renounce all earthly possessions, the real estate they live in is often owned by the community the nuns comprise, according to Spanish civil law. The Belorado Convent, for example, has been inscribed in Spain's Land Registry as belonging to the Poor Clares of Belorado since 1969.
Despite no longer being recognized by the Vatican, the rebel sisters still form a religious community, according to Mr. Alaez. "The church has no power over a monastic community that declares itself non-Catholic," he said. "It's as if a Jewish rabbi tried to govern a community of Buddhists or Muslims."
Mr. de Gamón, the church official, said the five elderly nuns who avoided excommunication are now the only legitimate Belorado Poor Clares, and so the properties belong to them, not to any of the expelled nuns. If the Vatican were to sever ties with the senior sisters, ownership of the properties would pass to the larger Spanish Federation of Poor Clares.
For now, the Archbishop of Burgos has filed an official eviction action in court, claiming the nuns "no longer have legal title to inhabit the buildings belonging to the monasteries they occupied."
It may be months, even years, before a ruling is reached in court, according to Mr. Alaez, the lawyer. In the meantime, the sisters intend to set up a company that will enable them to sell their products using new bank accounts.
These days, they receive the sacraments from a Sedevacantist bishop, Monsignor Rodrigo Henrique Ribeiro da Silva, who the Archdiocese of Burgos says is not recognized by the Roman Catholic Church. Monsignor da Silva openly calls Pope Francis a "heretic" and has been accused of neo-Nazi sympathies in the Spanish press.
In an interview, he said he flew to Spain from Brazil "to care for a handful of abandoned women." The nuns have enough to eat each day, but there isn't much left to buy cocoa to make truffles, and they say they have faced harassment at local markets.
On a recent morning, Bixintxo Azkarraga, 59, was buying a loaf of bread at the Orduña village market. He has bought sweets from the nuns there in the past, but he said he wouldn't buy from them again. "One thing is buying cakes from a nun," he said. "Another thing is buying from a fascist."
The backlash has not moved most of the sisters who continue to be squatters, though two of the excommunicated nuns have broken away from them and moved out.
"We do not repent," Sister Belén said.
Mr. de Gamón said the Archbishop of Burgos does not take lightly the prospect of casting the nuns out of their homes. "We're trying to find a peaceful and dignified solution, trying to help them find a new life," he said.
The archbishop, he added, "prays for them every day."

Honda and Nissan Weigh Possible Merger: [Correction]

Full text: The merger talks between Japan's second- and third-largest automakers highlight the intense upheaval within the world's auto industry.
Honda Motor and Nissan Motor, Japan's second- and third-largest automakers, are discussing ways to deepen their ties, including the possibility of a merger that could fundamentally restructure Japan's car industry.
The merger talks between the two storied Japanese giants highlight the intense upheaval within the world's auto industry, as carmakers grapple with expensive technological shifts, political instability and the rise of fast-growing Chinese rivals.
Though discussions are still at an early stage, the thinking at Nissan and Honda is that combining forces could provide the companies with the resources and scale necessary to navigate those immense pressures.
Last year, Honda sold 3.98 million vehicles and Nissan 3.37 million. Their combination could make them the world's third-largest automaker group, behind their Japanese rival Toyota Group, which sold 11.23 million vehicles last year, and Volkswagen Group of Germany, which sold 9.23 million.
Honda and Nissan began collaborating this year on the development of electric vehicles. Over several months, their discussions have expanded to include the potential creation of a new company under which both automakers would operate, according to two people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly.
Nissan and Honda are expected to sign a memorandum of understanding within the next week to formally begin discussions of partnership-broadening steps, including the details of a potential merger, the people familiar with the matter said. No final decisions have been made, they said.
The companies said in statements that they were in talks. "As announced in March of this year, Honda and Nissan are exploring various possibilities for future collaboration, leveraging each other's strengths," they said. "We will inform our stakeholders of any updates at an appropriate time."
The possibility of merging forces would have been largely unthinkable for two Japanese titans of auto making just a decade ago. The talks underscore the level of churn in the industry as manufacturers move away from the internal combustion engine, which has powered the vehicles they have produced for most of the past century.
Honda and Nissan each need to invest billions of dollars in electric vehicles, said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at Edmunds, a market research firm.
"Moving forward in E.V.s is expensive, and some of the smaller players have to figure out how to pay for it," she said. "And it's harder than ever now, because sales of E.V.s are growing more slowly than people had expected just a few years ago."
Nissan shares soared more than 20 percent during trading in Tokyo on Wednesday as investors reacted to the news about a potential merger. Honda's shares fell slightly.
Honda, founded in 1948, has long pursued a go-it-alone approach, developing components like engines on its own and spurning globe-spanning alliances. But more recently, the amount of investment required for a shift toward battery-powered vehicles has led it to seek partnerships with companies including Sony in Japan and General Motors in the United States.
Established in 1933, Nissan in particular has struggled in recent years to keep up with the swiftly growing appetite for hybrid gas-electric vehicles in the United States and fully electric cars in China. Last month, Nissan unveiled deep cuts to its global operations and said it needed to take steps to speed up its development of new offerings in its core markets.
Nissan's global sales declined across its core markets -- North America, China and Japan -- in the first half of its fiscal year. During the April-to-September period, its operating profit fell 90 percent, to $ 214 million.
Japanese automakers, like their peers in the United States and Europe, are also facing intense competition from new, highly cost-competitive and technologically advanced rivals in China. After enjoying years of state support, Chinese makers of electric vehicles like BYD are pushing deeper into Europe and Southeast Asia, where Japanese manufacturers have long dominated.
Last year, China overtook Japan for the first time to become the world's largest car exporter. China's exports were boosted by strong demand for electric vehicles and its shipments to Russia, a market that Japanese and Western automakers withdrew from in response to the war in Ukraine.
Like the Western automakers G.M., Ford Motor and Volkswagen, Nissan and Honda have struggled to compete in China as local rivals offer low-cost models tailored to the domestic market, which is the world's largest. Nissan has forecast that its sales in China will fall 13 percent this fiscal year. Honda projected an even larger slump.
As the industry adapts to the new market dynamics, automakers worldwide are forging more alliances. In September, G.M. said it would work with Hyundai of South Korea on internal combustion, electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles. Last month, Volkswagen said it would form a joint venture with the electric vehicle maker Rivian, a California start-up.
People at Honda and Nissan say a partnership could benefit both companies in a number of ways. Honda has a strong portfolio of fuel-efficient hybrid vehicles, and Nissan could help it build out its global supply chain for batteries. Nissan was an early pioneer in electric vehicles and has several popular models, including the Sakura minivehicle it offers in Japan.
Nissan also holds a large stake in Mitsubishi Motors, a smaller Japanese automaker. If a Nissan-Honda group is established, Mitsubishi will consider joining it, according to the Japanese newspaper Nikkei, which earlier reported the merger discussions.
Automotive mergers often fail to deliver the efficiencies and profits that executives hope for. DaimlerChrysler split after nine years of a mostly unhappy marriage. Stellantis was formed in the 2021 merger of Fiat Chrysler and the French PSA Group, and the chief executive who helped engineer the pairing, Carlos Tavares, resigned under pressure this month.
Nissan and the French automaker Renault have been strategic partners for more than two decades, and both saw some benefits early on, but neither achieved the kind of growth and profitability levels that executives and analysts had expected.
Last year, Nissan and Renault agreed to take steps to unwind their alliance. Around the same time, Honda and G.M. decided to scrap a plan to develop a line of lower-priced electric vehicles, less than two years after the companies announced the joint effort.

Automakers Struggle With Market Shift and Competition From China: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Changing technology, political turmoil and competition from China are cutting into profits and forcing carmakers to cut jobs and close factories.
A few years ago, automakers were celebrating record profits as the pandemic created shortages of new cars, allowing them to raise prices. Now the hangover is setting in.
Nissan, the Japanese automaker, is laying off 9,000 employees. Volkswagen is considering closing factories in Germany for the first time. The chief executive of the U.S. and European automaker Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Peugeot, Fiat and other brands, quit after sales tumbled. Even luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz are struggling.
Each carmaker has its own problems, but there are some common threads. They include a tricky and expensive technological transition, political turmoil, rising protectionism and the emergence of a new class of fast-growing Chinese carmakers. The many woes raise questions about the future of companies that are a critical source of jobs in many Western and Asian countries.
Many of these problems have been apparent for years but became less pressing during the pandemic, lulling some automakers into complacency. When shortages of semiconductors and other components slowed production and limited inventory, carmakers found it easy to raise prices.
But that era is over and the industry has reverted to its prepandemic state, with too many carmakers chasing too few buyers.
Many car factories around the world are making many fewer cars than they were built to produce. When automakers don't earn a decent return on their factories and machines, there is "a massive effect on profitability," said Simon Croom, a professor of supply chain management at the University of San Diego. "The difference between profit and loss is a very fine line in the auto industry."
Workers are among the first to suffer in an industry that employs nine million people worldwide in manufacturing, including around a million in the United States. More than two million more Americans work for dealers and related businesses.
Nissan, which has factories in Mississippi and Tennessee, has not detailed where its layoffs will take place. It is not alone in cutting jobs. Ford last month announced 4,000 job cuts, mostly at factories in Britain and Germany. The company cited "unprecedented competitive, regulatory, and economic headwinds."
Ford was partly referring to Chinese carmakers. Barely a factor before the pandemic, they have charged into the international market with cars that can match Japanese, European or American vehicles on quality, at much lower prices.
BYD, Chery, SAIC and other Chinese carmakers are still effectively barred from the United States by trade rules and hobbled by tariffs in Europe. But they are pushing into places like Australia, Brazil, Chile and Thailand, luring buyers away from the likes of Fiat, General Motors and Toyota.
Competition from China is "starting to hit the safe places that Western carmakers had," said Felipe Munoz, global analyst at JATO Dynamics, a research firm.
Inside China, the world's largest car market, domestic manufacturers have stolen the limelight from foreign carmakers with over-the-top options like those offered by BYD in its Yangwang U8, a plug-in hybrid off-road vehicle.
The U8 can stay afloat for up to 30 minutes in a flood, according to the company, and its wheels can be set to roll so that the vehicle can rotate 360 degrees while remaining in the same spot.
The rise of Chinese automakers has been particularly tough on German carmakers. Volkswagen gets one-third of its sales from China and once dominated that market. But the company's deliveries there plunged 10 percent in the first nine months of this year, compared with 2023.
BMW and Mercedes-Benz have also reported big sales declines in China recently, which they blamed for lower profits.
American carmakers have also suffered from this shift. G.M. said this month that it would take a more than $ 5 billion hit to its profit as it restructured its Chinese operations, which have been losing money.
Companies that were slow to replace aging models are doing worst. That has been the case for Nissan, Stellantis and even Tesla, which analysts expect to end the year with sales that are roughly unchanged from 2023. Others have struggled to build appealing electric vehicles and develop software, an increasingly important element of car design.
Volkswagen was among the first established carmakers to develop electric vehicles, but the models underwhelmed buyers and critics. Sales in the United States of the company's ID.4 sport-utility vehicle plunged by more than half in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to Kelley Blue Book. Buggy software handicapped sales of the ID.4 and other electric models that Volkswagen sells in Europe and Asia.
"The Chinese are winning market share and the Germans are losing," said Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research in Bochum, Germany. "It's not only the electric cars, it's the software in the cars."
Changing government policy is adding to the carmakers' woes. Sales of electric vehicles plunged in Germany after the government, facing a budget crisis, abruptly eliminated financial incentives.
In the United States, President-elect Donald J. Trump and Republicans in Congress want to repeal Biden-era tax credits designed to promote electric vehicles. The shifts in policy endanger the hundreds of billions of dollars that G.M., Hyundai-Kia, Volkswagen and others have invested in new factories and cars.
"The auto industry has had to dish out a lot of capital for an underwhelming E.V. market and one that may well change in the next six months," said Erin Keating, an executive analyst at Cox Automotive, a research firm.
Mr. Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs on imports from China, Mexico and Canada. China is an important source of components for virtually all carmakers. Mexico is an important manufacturing center for BMW, G.M., Ford, Stellantis, Volkswagen and others, shipping two million vehicles to the United States in the first nine months of the year.
Not all car companies are doing poorly. G.M. shares have risen more than 40 percent this year, while shares of most automakers have fallen. In part, Wall Street is rewarding G.M. for popular electric vehicles like the Cadillac Lyriq and Chevrolet Equinox. Mary T. Barra, the G.M. chief executive, has said the company is close to making a profit on electric vehicles, unlike other American carmakers excluding Tesla.
But G.M. is also retrenching, announcing last week that it would stop developing robotaxis, autonomous vehicles that can carry passengers without drivers. The decision raised questions about whether established carmakers can compete with Tesla and Waymo, a division of Google's parent company, in the next generation of automotive technology.
Toyota's strategy of doubling down on hybrids, while offering few all-electric cars, also appears to be paying off -- at least for now. Many buyers are choosing hybrids, which cost a lot less than electric vehicles and don't need to be charged, as a way to reduce emissions and fuel expenses.
But Toyota could be left behind if sales of electric vehicles grow faster than market analysts expect. Prices for battery-powered vehicles are dropping while the distance they can travel on a charge is growing. In China, electric vehicles are already cheaper than comparable gasoline models. More than half of new cars sold there are electric or plug-in hybrids.
Carmakers are trying to adapt. Stellantis, whose chief executive, Carlos Tavares, quit this month, has new models lined up for 2025. They include several electric vehicles, among them Jeeps, Ram pickups and a Dodge Charger muscle car. The company is also working to repair its relationship with dealers who feel that Stellantis waited too long to lower prices and offer incentives to help them sell cars that were piling up on their lots.
John Elkann, the chairman of Stellantis, held a virtual meeting with U.S. dealers after Mr. Tavares's resignation. Later, the Stellantis National Dealer Council issued a statement expressing optimism that "2025 will mark a turning point."
Attempts to reach Mr. Tavares for comment were unsuccessful.
Market pressures will prompt carmakers to cooperate with one another more, for example, by sharing the costs of engine development, said K. Venkatesh Prasad, the senior vice president of research at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.
"You're seeing some of this already," he said.
Makoto Uchida, Nissan's chief executive, said last month that the company would reduce the time it takes to develop a new vehicle by working more closely with its partners Renault, Mitsubishi and Honda.
Volkswagen is trying to solve its software problems by investing in Rivian, which makes electric pickups and sport utility vehicles in Illinois.
Western carmakers are also making deals with Chinese automakers. Volkswagen will develop new models with Xpeng to sell in China. Last year, Stellantis bought a 20 percent stake in Leapmotor and has begun selling the Chinese company's electric vehicles in Europe.
"If you can't beat 'em," Mr. Dudenhöffer said, "join 'em."

Automakers Thrived in the Pandemic. Many Are Now Struggling.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A few years ago, automakers were celebrating record profits as the pandemic created shortages of new cars, allowing them to raise prices. Now the hangover is setting in.
Nissan, the Japanese automaker, is laying off 9,000 employees. Volkswagen is considering closing factories in Germany for the first time. The CEO of U.S. and European automaker Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Peugeot, Fiat and other brands, quit after sales tumbled. Even luxury brands including BMW and Mercedes-Benz are struggling.
Each carmaker has its own problems, but there are some common threads. They include a tricky and expensive technological transition, political turmoil, rising protectionism and the emergence of a new class of fast-growing Chinese carmakers. The many woes raise questions about the future of companies that are a crucial source of jobs in many Western and Asian countries.
Many of these problems have been apparent for years but became less pressing during the pandemic, lulling some automakers into complacency. When shortages of semiconductors and other components slowed production and limited inventory, carmakers found it easy to raise prices.
But that era is over and the industry has reverted to its prepandemic state, with too many carmakers chasing too few buyers.
Many car factories worldwide are making many fewer cars than they were built to produce. When automakers don’t earn a decent return on their factories and machines, there is “a massive effect on profitability,” said Simon Croom, a professor of supply chain management at the University of San Diego. “The difference between profit and loss is a very fine line in the auto industry.”
Workers are among the first to suffer in an industry that employs 9 million people worldwide in manufacturing, including about 1 million in the United States. More than 2 million more Americans work for dealers and related businesses.
Nissan, which has factories in Mississippi and Tennessee, has not detailed where its layoffs will take place. It is not alone in cutting jobs. Ford last month announced 4,000 job cuts, mostly at factories in Britain and Germany. The company cited “unprecedented competitive, regulatory and economic headwinds.”
Ford was partly referring to Chinese carmakers. Barely a factor before the pandemic, they have charged into the international market with cars that can match Japanese, European or American vehicles on quality, at much lower prices.
BYD, Chery, SAIC and other Chinese carmakers are still effectively barred from the United States by trade rules and hobbled by tariffs in Europe. But they are pushing into places like Australia, Brazil, Chile and Thailand, luring buyers away from the likes of Fiat, General Motors and Toyota.
Competition from China is “starting to the hit the safe places that Western carmakers had,” said Felipe Munoz, global analyst at JATO Dynamics, a research firm.
Inside China, the world’s largest car market, domestic manufacturers have stolen the limelight from foreign carmakers with over-the-top options like those offered by BYD in its Yangwang U8, a plug-in hybrid off-road vehicle.
The U8 can stay afloat for up to 30 minutes in a flood, according to the company, and its wheels can be set to roll so that the vehicle can rotate 360 degrees while remaining in the same spot.
The rise of Chinese automakers has been particularly tough on German carmakers. Volkswagen gets one-third of its sales from China and once dominated that market. But the company’s deliveries there plunged 10% in the first nine months of this year, compared with 2023.
BMW and Mercedes-Benz have also reported big sales declines in China recently, which they blamed for lower profits.
U.S. carmakers have also suffered from this shift. GM said this month that it would take a more than $5 billion hit to its profit as it restructured its Chinese operations, which have been losing money.
Companies that were slow to replace aging models are doing worst. That has been the case for Nissan, Stellantis and even Tesla, which analysts expect to end the year with sales that are roughly unchanged from 2023. Others have struggled to build appealing electric vehicles and develop software, an increasingly important element of car design.
Volkswagen was among the first established carmakers to develop electric vehicles, but the models underwhelmed buyers and critics. Sales in the United States of the company’s ID.4 SUV plunged by more than half in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to Kelley Blue Book.

You Want It Delivered Today? This Is What It Takes.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Retailers like Amazon, Walmart and Target have figured out that if they get you your online order today, you will probably spend more tomorrow.
One day in early November, I ordered an emotional support pickle. The image on Amazon showed a green crocheted prolate vegetable, with a pink bow fixed on top and two black button eyes. It held a sign that read, "Emotional Support Pickle: I will always be around to let you know that you are a BIG DILL."
I wanted it right away. And my wish seemed attainable.
In the past year, if you've shopped online from one of the big retailers, you've probably noticed new delivery options. You do not have to wait two days or even overnight for your package to arrive. Instead, you can get what you want that very afternoon, between 4 and 8 p.m., if you'd like.
For $ 6.99, I could get a little emotional support during the busy holiday shopping season, which, for a reporter covering the retail industry, is also the busy season. More important, I wanted to understand how it was possible to order a gag gift in the morning and have it arrive before I went to sleep.
Retailers, which have long competed on price or quality, are now in an all-out race for same-day deliveries. Why? Few people truly need the service; if you are desperate for diapers or a special pasta-making attachment, you'll go to the store. But companies have found that, once acquired, the taste for speedy delivery makes customers both loyal and willing to spend more money.
"Customers love fast delivery, and the faster we deliver, the more often customers come back," said Sarah Mathew, a vice president for delivery experience at Amazon. "It doesn't sound like rocket science, but that was really the aha of 'Oh, we should really continue to invest here."'
Amazon set the standard for speed. For years, Amazon's Prime membership, which now costs $ 139 a year, came with two-day shipping. Then in April 2019, it announced that next-day delivery would be the new normal. Almost immediately, sales growth picked up steam.
Retailers like Walmart joined the race, and found they had an advantage: physical stores close to doorsteps. Walmart, which last year started offering customers deliveries in as little as 30 minutes, says it can now offer same-day delivery to 86 percent of all U.S. households from its 4,600 stores. In November, Walmart's chief financial officer said deliveries from stores were up nearly 50 percent from a year earlier and accounted for $ 2.5 billion in sales in each of the previous 12 consecutive months. Sales on delivered items grew faster than sales in stores.
Target also uses the merchandise in its stores to get same-day orders to customers' homes. And average shipping times for all orders are nearly a day faster than they were a year ago, Target's chief operating officer said last month, helped by sortation centers, which rely on products from its stores and Shipt, a delivery service it purchased in 2017.
Amazon doesn't have thousands of stores near shoppers. So it has tried other techniques. The company introduced drone delivery that could get packages to customers in Texas and Arizona within an hour. There were limits: The item had to be under five pounds. Standing kitchen mixer emergency? Forget it.
In 2023, the company redesigned its U.S. fulfillment network, breaking its nationwide system into eight regions. That meant more products would be closer to more customers, making deliveries faster and cheaper because they had to cover less distance.
The company also shaved time by opening same-day facilities, which combine a warehouse and a delivery depot into one structure. There are more than 55 of these facilities.
With the holiday shopping season in full swing, that speed will be put to the test. On Cyber Monday, consumers spent $ 13.3 billion, a 7.3 percent increase from last year.
To see Amazon's same-day delivery "on steroids," as Ms. Mathew put it, I toured one of the company's newest same-day facilities.
I also saw where the company's ambitions to deliver your desires at superhero speed hit some bumps, depending on where you live. The company has same-day delivery to 120 metro areas and is building same-day facilities "where the demand is," Ms. Mathew said. But even within high-demand areas, the system has snafus.
I found this out trying to get my nonedible pickle delivered to my apartment in Brooklyn. "Unbeknownst to you," said Marc Wulfraat, an industry consultant who closely tracks Amazon's facilities, "you stumbled upon a complicated complex."
Or, as Zac Rogers, a professor of operations and supply chain management at Colorado State University, told me, Amazon's same-day delivery "works sort of through a combination basically of elegant innovation and brute force scale."
A New York-Chicago Challenge
Around 11 a.m. on Nov. 7, I tried to order my emotional support pickle. The page responded with a cheery "Thank you for loving same-day delivery this much!" before giving me the bad news: All the same-day delivery offers had been claimed for the day. I should come back tomorrow.
Instead of getting a pickle, I was in one. I vowed to try again.
The next morning, I logged on before 7, surely early enough to grab a slot before everything had been spoken for. But I received the same message. I started changing delivery addresses to see if that would make a difference, eventually hitting the mark with a friend's building about a mile away. I could get my pickle on the same day if I sent it her way. I had to wait for her to wake up, and then there was some back and forth to explain why I urgently needed this item. By then, the same-day slots for her house had disappeared.
Soon after, however, my dad called. My parents live in Chicago, but we share an Amazon Prime account, and he wanted to know why I was changing the addresses. (Monitoring his accounts is one of the many ways my retired father fills his days, I guess.) Curious, he asked to get in on the action. The mission to figure out same-day delivery was now a national one.
He purchased his support pickle around 9 a.m. Following the pickle's progress on the Amazon app on his phone, he saw it go out for delivery before 10. At 12:33, three and a half hours after he made his order, he texted me: The pickle had arrived.
When I ordered the pickle the next morning at 8, Amazon told me that it would arrive at my friend's house between 5 and 10 p.m. It traveled from a fulfillment center in Robbinsville, N.J., and it arrived within that window at 7:30, almost 12 hours later.
I texted my dad the update. "That area is a different beast," he responded.
He was correct. My parents live a short drive from one of Amazon's same-day facilities. I do not.
Pods and Cubbies Along the Happy Path
In New York City, there is one Amazon same-day center: a 218,000-square-foot warehouse in the Bronx that sits on the lot of a former multiplex cinema and has been operating for a year. The combined warehouse and delivery depot sends same-day orders to customers in the Bronx and nearby Queens, but not to Manhattan, Brooklyn or Staten Island.
Other fulfillment centers can accommodate same-day deliveries by adding a dedicated group that handles those orders -- which is how the pickle reached my friend's house -- but they are not set up in quite the same way. One way to move things faster is by limiting the options. Amazon's large fulfillment centers can store up to 40 million products, but same-day centers like the one in the Bronx keep on hand just the 100,000 top-selling items for that area.
"This is their version of a Walmart store," Mr. Wulfraat, the consultant, said.
On a recent Tuesday morning, Pratik Shah, a 28-year-old site manager, led me on a tour of the Bronx center. He showed me the "happy path" that my emotional support pickle would have taken had I lived in the right borough. It takes an average of five hours from the time a customer clicks the buy button to when the item arrives at the door, Mr. Shah said.
The available merchandise is determined by what millions of customers are searching for and purchasing frequently. In the Bronx, that includes "everyday essentials" like Gatorade, garbage bags, cat litter and adhesive hooks, as well as electronics like frequently misplaced iPhone chargers and air tags to find them the next time.
As Halloween approaches, more costumes are moved to same-day delivery. The same goes for toys as Christmas nears.
"It's not necessarily going to be what you want," said Matthew Hockenberry, a historian of supply chains at Fordham University. "It's what you are willing to accept."
When a customer places a same-day order and it is routed to the Bronx center, things start happening quickly. Smaller items that can be grabbed by hand are stored on tall yellow robots called "pods." These previously packed pods navigate to workers' stations. Think of those pods as shelves in a store. (Larger items are held in another part of the warehouse.)
While I watched, a screen directed Keri Simon, a fulfillment center associate, to grab particular items off the pod -- a bottle of shampoo or a 2025 New Yorker calendar -- and place them in a gray cubbyhole.
On the other side of the cubbyholes, Isabel Isais packed the items into one of three different sleeves: two sizes of brown paper and one plastic option. The computer in front showed which packaging to choose. Using these sleeves is faster than loading up boxes. Then a machine spit out a shipping label, which Ms. Isais put on the package.
All of this took seconds.
From there, my emotional support pickle would have been placed on a conveyor belt that carried it around the plant until it reached a machine that stamped a yellow sticker indicating its delivery route on the wrapped package. Amazon uses what it calls "routing technology" to account for the type of delivery locations, the size and weight of the package, walking distance and getting in and out of the vehicle.
On its final leg in the warehouse, the package falls down a designated chute where workers place packages in a cart. The carts, which hold up to 75 packages, are rolled to a pickup area. Delivery drivers then pull their assigned cart into the parking lot for one of the four daily deliveries: "breakfast," "brunch," "lunch" or "dinner" -- the meal you may be eating when your package arrives.
Making Nice With the Doorman
One of the biggest issues in delivery is the "last-mile" problem -- getting an object from a warehouse to your doorstep. This step adds costs, and the logistics can be hairy. And in cities like New York, a profusion of delivery vehicles block narrow streets and create traffic jams.
In the parking lot of Amazon's center in the Bronx, there are no Amazon delivery trucks, just a lot of Nissans and Toyotas. The delivery drivers wear blue Amazon vests, but they drive their own cars, loading up their trunks and back seats with goods.
Amazon classifies drivers who handle Amazon's same-day deliveries -- called Amazon Flex -- as independent contractors. But the drivers sued Amazon in 2016, saying they were being misclassified; that proposed class action is still being litigated.
For the time being, Amazon limits its same-day orders in New York City because of traffic and other issues, said Brian Perez, who leads Amazon's same-day operations in several Northeastern states. Delivering in the city creates special headaches, particularly in Manhattan, where drivers and e-bike delivery people can be foiled by incorrect passcodes or mislabeled apartment numbers.
Mr. Perez said he had a team that worked "with the lobby management" to build Amazon lockers or "cater our delivery times around each of the apartment building constraints."
They make friendly with the doorman, essentially.
Before I left the Bronx same-day center, I wanted to know if there had ever been an item that made Mr. Perez scratch his head and wonder, "Does that person really needed that today?"
After some coaxing, he offered an answer.
"I mean, a PlayStation controller comes to mind," Mr. Perez said. "Did you really need that same day?"
But, in truth, he didn't judge. Some people are avid gamers. Some need their Gatorade electrolyte boost. Some have a yen for an emotional support pickle.
"To each his own, right?" he said. It was his job, along with the robots, the pickers, the packers, the scanners and the drivers, to get them there.

C.E.O. Quits At Stellantis After Slump: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company, facing slumping sales, announced that Carlos Tavares would step down immediately and that a search for a new chief was underway.
The chief executive of the automaker Stellantis, Carlos Tavares, has resigned, the company said on Sunday, amid a decline in profits and slumping sales in its key North America region.
Mr. Tavares, 66, spearheaded the creation of the company in a 2021 merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and France's Peugeot. The company is one of the largest automakers in the world and produces vehicles under an array of brand names, including Chrysler, Jeep, Ram, Dodge, Fiat, Peugeot, Opel and Maserati.
"Stellantis's success since its creation has been rooted in a perfect alignment between the reference shareholders, the board and the C.E.O.," the company's senior independent director, Henri de Castries, said in a statement. "However, in recent weeks different views have emerged which have resulted in the board and the C.E.O. coming to today's decision."
Mr. Tavares could not immediately be reached for comment.
The resignation took effect on Sunday, the company said in the statement. Mr. Tavares had announced this year that he planned to retire at the end of his current contract, in 2026. The company also said a search for a successor by a special board committee was "well underway." It added that a new executive committee, headed by John Elkann, the chairman of the Stellantis board, would run the company until a permanent replacement for Mr. Tavares was named.
Mr. Elkann is a grandson of Gianni Agnelli, the Italian industrialist who founded Fiat. Mr. Elkann worked closely with Sergio Marchionne, who engineered Fiat's 2009 takeover of Chrysler, which was going through a bankruptcy.
Fiat Chrysler became profitable and grew under Mr. Marchionne, who died unexpectedly in 2018.
By 2020, though, both Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot were struggling to keep pace with other automakers that were investing tens of billions of dollars to develop and produce electric vehicles, and a merger between the two companies was forged. The combined company renamed itself Stellantis in 2021.
Under Mr. Tavares, Stellantis flourished for a time after the trans-Atlantic merger, and reported a record profit of 18.6 billion euros, about $ 19.7 billion, in 2023. He also outlined plans to develop E.V.s, although Stellantis was moving at a slower pace than its Detroit rivals, General Motors and Ford Motor. Bonuses stemming from the 2023 results helped make Mr. Tavares one of the highest-paid executives in the auto industry.
But the company's profits have fallen this year, as sales in the United States have dropped significantly. It was slow to match rivals' price reductions and sales incentives, and dealer inventories rose. In response, Stellantis has laid off workers, cut production and left idle a plant in Illinois that it had planned to restart.
In the first nine months of the year, Stellantis's U.S. sales fell 17 percent. In September, a group of dealers sent Mr. Tavares an open letter, blaming him for decisions aimed at driving up profits in 2023 that they said left the company in a troubled state.
"The intent of this letter is to sound an alarm -- an alarm, not only to you, but to the Stellantis board of directors, your employees, your investors and your suppliers," the letter said. "The reckless short-term decision making to secure record profits in 2023 has had devastating, yet entirely predictable, consequences in the U.S. market."
Soon after, Stellantis issued a profit warning, saying the cost of fixing its U.S. operations would dent its bottom line. Specifically, the company said operating profit would, at best, amount to 7 percent of sales compared with an earlier forecast of more than 10 percent.
The company's stock price has dropped more than 50 percent this year, from a high of more than $ 29 in March to $ 13.20, its close on Friday. On Monday, the stock fell another 8 percent.
The transition to electric vehicles has presented challenges for many automakers. While G.M., Toyota and Tesla continue to post substantial profits, Ford and Volkswagen have struggled to make money on E.V.s. The E.V. start-up Rivian has had trouble ramping up sales beyond about 50,000 vehicles a year.
Volkswagen recently said it could close as many as three plants, including factories in Germany, a once-unthinkable step for the company.
Mr. Tavares was born and educated in Portugal, and joined Renault in his early 20s. He rose through the ranks and became a close lieutenant of Carlos Ghosn, who was the chief executive of both Renault and Nissan. Mr. Tavares worked at the Japanese automaker Nissan for several years while it was controlled by Renault. He left Renault amid a falling out with Mr. Ghosn in 2013, and was hired as Peugeot's chief executive a year later.
Last month, Mr. Tavares announced a new design for large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, including electric models, and said Stellantis was on track to slash carbon emissions from its vehicles and factories by 2038. "This is our commitment to no-compromise innovation as we deliver clean, safe and affordable mobility to all," he said.

Trump Tariffs Would Be 'Two-Alarm Fire' for Automakers and Parts Suppliers: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Automakers and parts suppliers would struggle if President-elect Donald J. Trump followed through on his threat to impose 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico.
President-elect Donald J. Trump's threat to impose 25 percent tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada sent shivers on Tuesday through the auto industry, which depends heavily on both countries for parts and manufacturing.
The prospect of tariffs "is a two-alarm fire for the auto industry," said Patrick Anderson, chief executive of Anderson Economic Group, a consulting firm in Michigan. "There is probably not a single assembly plant in Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Texas that would not immediately be affected by a 25 percent tariff."
The list of popular vehicles made in Mexico or Canada is long. It includes Ram pickups made by Stellantis in Saltillo, Mexico, and Chrysler minivans built in Windsor, Ontario. General Motors makes Chevrolet Silverado pickups and electric versions of Equinox and Blazer S.U.V.s in Mexico, where Ford Motor also makes its Maverick pickup.
All of those vehicles and many others would become significantly more expensive if Mr. Trump, who won Michigan with promises to preserve auto jobs, followed through on his threat, economists said. Those higher auto prices would have a significant effect on overall inflation. And higher car prices would probably lead to lower sales and layoffs at auto factories.
"In his first term, President Trump instituted tariffs against China that created jobs, spurred investment and resulted in no inflation," Karoline Leavitt, spokeswoman for the Trump-Vance Transition, said in an email. Once in office, she said, he will work to bring jobs back to the United States by "raising real wages, lowering taxes, cutting regulations and unshackling American energy."
The prospect of disruptive tariffs hits the industry at a perilous moment. Virtually all automakers are struggling with sagging consumer demand, a growing preference for hybrids and electric cars, and the emergence of Chinese automakers like BYD that are pushing into markets once dominated by Japanese, American and European companies.
Signs of industry woes are proliferating. Nissan, which manufactures several vehicles in Aguascalientes, Mexico, as well as Mississippi and Tennessee, said this month that it would lay off 9,000 employees worldwide because of declining sales. Volkswagen, which has factories in Mexico and Tennessee, is considering closing plants in Europe for the first time in its history.
Sales at Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Peugeot, Fiat and other brands, fell 27 percent in the third quarter compared with a year earlier. Even luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz, which make cars in Mexico and the United States, are earning smaller profits.
Mr. Trump's policy pronouncements have already jolted the industry. The president-elect has vowed to eliminate Biden-era subsidies for electric vehicles, endangering tens of billion of dollars that General Motors and other automakers have invested in U.S. battery factories and new car models.
"The auto industry is in a process of a transformation that is the biggest tech upgrade in history," said Dimitry Anastakis, a professor at the University of Toronto who studies business history. "They are looking for as much stability as possible as they navigate this disruptive landscape. To throw a spanner in the works is not helpful."
Mexican and Canadian factories buy auto parts from the United States and the two countries are major suppliers of components to virtually all U.S. manufacturers including Tesla. That company's chief executive, Elon Musk, was a big supporter of Mr. Trump's campaign and is expected to play a significant role in his administration.
Automakers got a taste of how closely linked they are to Canada in 2022, when groups of truck drivers in that country blocked a bridge linking Windsor to Detroit in protest of pandemic restrictions. Toyota, Ford, Stellantis and others were forced to shut down U.S. assembly lines because of parts shortages even though the protest lasted less than a week.
"Southern Ontario is closer to Detroit auto plants than the supply plants in Indiana, Ohio and Kansas are," said Erik Gordon, a professor of business at the University of Michigan, who follows the auto industry. Tariffs, he said, "would have an effect similar to New York City imposing a tax on food and fuel that comes into the city from New Jersey."
Mr. Trump said tariffs would remain in place until Mexico stopped the flow of illicit drugs and unauthorized immigrants to the United States. But tariffs could lead to an increase in migration if some of the one million Mexicans who work in the auto industry lost their jobs, analysts say.
"As the economy goes, there goes prosperity," said Anna Nagurney, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who studies supply chains. "It can have spillover effects."
Tariffs could push Mexico closer to China. BYD, SAIC, Geely and other Chinese carmakers have been moving into Mexico, plastering billboards with images of their cars and opening dealerships at a fast clip. BYD and others have been scouting locations in Monterrey and other cities as sites for manufacturing plants.
But plans for factories are on hold while the Chinese wait to see what Mr. Trump will do, Mexican officials have said.
Wall Street was clearly alarmed by the prospect of tariffs. G.M.'s stock closed 9 percent lower on Tuesday after Mr. Trump's statement on tariffs. Stellantis fell about 6 percent, and Ford was down nearly 3 percent.
Ford said its shares suffered less because its operations were more concentrated in the United States than other automakers. "Ford is the most committed to building in America among the major automakers," the company said in a statement.
Ford, General Motors, Stellantis, Nissan and Volkswagen declined to answer questions about tariffs, as did the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the industry's main trade group.
BMW, which has large factories in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, and Spartanburg, S.C., declined to comment on Mr. Trump's tariff threat, but said in a statement that free markets are "a key factor not only for our business model, but also for growth, welfare and employment throughout the global economy."
Some auto experts expressed hope that the threat of tariffs was merely a bargaining tool and would never be imposed. The strategy could be effective, some experts conceded.
"People in China and Canada are thinking about concessions they could make before there is even anything on the table," said Richard Baldwin, a professor of economics at the International Institute for Management Development in Lausanne, Switzerland. "He's forcing the Canadians and Mexicans to prenegotiate with themselves."

Trump Seen As a Threat To E.V. Sales: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Fewer people will be able to afford electric cars and trucks if President-elect Donald J. Trump and Republicans in Congress eliminate a $ 7,500 federal tax credit.
Many car buyers have come to rely on a $ 7,500 federal tax credit on electric vehicles to soften the blow of their high prices. But those credits could disappear after President-elect Donald J. Trump takes office, leading to an almost immediate drop in sales of the cars and trucks.
Electric car sales could fall 27 percent if consumers lose the tax break, according to estimates published last week by three economics professors, Joseph Shapiro of the University of California, Berkeley, Felix Tintelnot of Duke University and Hunt Allcott of Stanford. Registrations of electric models are on track to hit 1.2 million this year, and estimates are that there would be about 317,000 fewer registered annually without the credit.
Other countries that eliminated such subsidies have seen similar drops -- in Germany, electric vehicle sales tumbled 27 percent in the first 10 months of the year, after the government last December abruptly canceled an incentive worth $ 4,900.
"You can't make a vehicle $ 7,500 more expensive and sell more of them easily," said Chris Harto, a senior policy analyst for Consumer Reports. "People are only willing to pay so much."
The tax credits, which can be as high as $ 7,500 for new electric cars and plug-in hybrids, and up to $ 4,000 for used models, are a cornerstone of President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, a law meant to address climate change and spur domestic manufacturing. Since January, consumers who buy or lease eligible cars have driven home with $ 2 billion in credits on 300,000 cars, according to the Treasury Department.
New-car prices are flat in 2024, but have risen nearly 30 percent since the start of the pandemic. And the gap between battery-powered cars and internal combustion models remains stubbornly wide. Consumers paid $ 56,900 on average for an electric car in October, $ 9,000 more than for the average gasoline car or hybrid, according to Kelley Blue Book, though the tax credit often significantly reduced that gap.
Mr. Trump regularly attacked Mr. Biden's policies on climate and electric cars on the campaign trail, and his transition team is exploring steps he could take to repeal or limit the credits. A complete repeal would require Congress to act. But Mr. Trump could also direct the Treasury to change tax rules in ways that limit how many cars qualify for credits.
Those efforts have the support of one of Mr. Trump's biggest supporters, Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, which makes roughly half of the electric vehicles sold in the United States. Mr. Musk has called for the elimination of all subsides for electric vehicles. He has also said the loss of the tax break would hurt Tesla less than it would other automakers.
But even Tesla would take a hit because the company's two top-selling cars are eligible for the $ 7,500 credit. Losing the credit could further depress the company's sales, which have been tepid this year because it has few new models to compete with electric cars from other automakers.
Tesla and the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment.
Some state governments also offer incentives, and Democratic governors could try to offer more support if federal policy changes. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California on Monday said that he would propose restoring an electric vehicle rebate program that ended last year if the federal credits were repealed.
If the credits end, Mr. Harto said, some automakers might make up some of the difference by offering bigger discounts to sustain sales and keep their factories humming. Several automakers are already offering year-end deals, including monthly leases below $ 250 on models like the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Nissan Ariya and Kia Niro. Mr. Harto advises shoppers interested in such vehicles to buy one soon.
"If you're really considering an E.V. over the next few years, there's probably no better time than today," he said.
Albert Gore III, the executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, a trade group, said ending credits would instantly raise prices for the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry. Three of four electric cars sold in the United States are built domestically, by companies including Tesla, Ford Motor, General Motors, Hyundai, Rivian and Volkswagen.
"This is going to be inflationary on the entire car market, no doubt about it," said Mr. Gore, whose father was the U.S. vice president from 1993 to 2001.
Mr. Harto said price increases could be a deal-killer for budget shoppers. Several affordable electric models -- the kind many Americans have clamored for -- have recently arrived in showrooms, with encouraging early sales. They include the Chevrolet Blazer sport utility vehicle and the mechanically related Honda Prologue, both built at a G.M. plant in Mexico. With both models eligible for a full $ 7,500 credit, the Blazer costs as little as $ 38,500 and the Prologue about $ 41,000. An electric Chevrolet Equinox costs $ 27,500 after the credit, on a par with similar gasoline vehicles.
Still, some analysts note that many electric cars are already ineligible for the tax credit.
Just 20 percent of electric car buyers claimed a tax credit in the first half of 2024, according to BloombergNEF, a research firm. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, cars are eligible for the credit only if they are assembled in North America and are powered by batteries that include materials from the United States or its trade allies. Only 13 models offer the full $ 7,500 credit through Dec. 31. Another eight are eligible for $ 3,750.
Buyers also have to earn incomes below $ 300,000 for couples and $ 150,000 for individuals.
Those restrictions do not apply if electric cars are leased. As a result, leases made up 79 percent of all electric-car transactions in dealerships in October, up from 16 percent in January, according to Edmunds. Those figures do not include brands, such as Tesla, Rivian and Lucid, that sell cars directly to consumers.
For people who are not ready to buy a new car, many formerly leased cars should enter the used market in coming years. They may make for tempting deals because battery-powered models have suffered sharp depreciation since Tesla started slashing prices last year.
Sales of electric cars have slowed in 2024, yet these cars have never been more popular: Americans bought a record 346,000 such models in the third quarter, according to Kelley Blue Book. Sales are up 9 percent in the first nine months of the year.
Supporters warn that killing the credits would blunt that momentum, with damaging effects for the environment, jobs and global competitiveness. The Environmental Defense Fund said companies had announced $ 126 billion in electric car and battery manufacturing investment since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, creating 108,000 jobs. By 2027, automakers will have built annual capacity for 5.8 million electric cars, enough to supply more than one in three new vehicles at current sales levels.
Opponents of credits say electric vehicles should compete with gasoline models without the help of the federal government. They note that many battery-powered cars are luxury models bought or leased by people who can afford the vehicles without tax breaks.
"I've driven them, and they are incredible," Mr. Trump said about electric vehicles at a July campaign rally in Michigan, "but they're not for everybody."
Mr. Harto said electric cars would eventually have to stand on their own. But the Inflation Reduction Act was aimed at fostering a domestic ecosystem of cars, batteries, components and minerals before it is too late to catch up to China, which dominates the industry.
"Do we want to build those cars and batteries in the U.S., or just import them from China?" Mr. Harto said. "The incentives give automakers a cushion to scale up and figure it out."
Even if Congress repeals the credits or Mr. Trump rewrites the rules, some industry executives expect a temporary jolt in sales, not a permanent decline. Jim Cain, a G.M. spokesman, said the automaker began investing in electric vehicle and battery factories years before the Inflation Reduction Act took effect, a strategy that is now paying dividends.
"The purest way to drive E.V. demand is with good-looking vehicles that hit all the buttons for consumers," Mr. Cain said, "and we think we've got those pieces."

If E.V. Rebates End, Newsom Says California Will Step Up: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Gov. Gavin Newsom said California would fill the void for residents if the Trump administration killed a $ 7,500 E.V. tax credit.
California will step in and provide rebates to eligible residents who buy electric vehicles if President-elect Donald J. Trump ends the $ 7,500 federal E.V. tax credit, Gov. Gavin Newsom said on Monday.
"We will intervene if the Trump administration eliminates the federal tax credit, doubling down on our commitment to clean air and green jobs in California," Mr. Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement. "We're not turning back on a clean transportation future -- we're going to make it more affordable for people to drive vehicles that don't pollute."
Mr. Newsom's proposal comes as California officials gird for an extended battle with the incoming Trump administration over environmental policy, immigration and other issues. As he did during his first term, Mr. Trump is expected to try once again to block California's authority to set auto emissions limits that are stricter than federal standards.
Already, Mr. Newsom has called a special session of the California Legislature for December, in part to discuss an increase in funding for litigation. During Mr. Trump's first term, California sued his administration more than 120 times.
"The American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail, including stopping attacks on gas-powered cars," spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. "When he takes office, President Trump will support the auto industry, allowing space for both gas-powered cars and electric vehicles."
Mr. Trump cannot unilaterally eliminate the electric vehicle tax credits, which are part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Congress would have to amend the law or pass a new one to erase the credits. But his transition team has indicated that the president-elect wants the credits gone.
Under the law, consumers can lower the purchase price of an electric, plug-in hybrid or fuel-cell vehicle by up to $ 7,500 for a new vehicle and up to $ 4,000 for a used one. There are some restrictions, including income ceilings, for those who qualify.
The average sale price in October for a new electric car was $ 56,902 compared with $ 48,623 for a gas-powered vehicle, according to Kelley Blue Book.
Electric vehicles became symbolic of President Biden's climate agenda, and therefore a prime target for Mr. Trump and Republicans. The growth of electric vehicles also poses a threat to the oil and gas industry, which donated heavily to Mr. Trump's presidential campaign.
Mr. Newsom said that if Mr. Trump eliminated the credit, the governor would propose restarting a rebate program that California had for zero-emissions vehicles from 2010 to 2023. The structure of the program changed over time, but began with a $ 5,000 direct-to-consumer rebate for battery electric vehicles that eventually increased to $ 7,500. It helped fund more than 594,000 vehicles and saved more than 456 million gallons of fuel, state officials said.
The governor also cannot act unilaterally; the State Legislature would have to agree to restart the rebate program. Although California's state budget is among the nation's largest, its revenues tend to be volatile. Lawmakers struggled to cover a shortfall this year.
A new rebate program may exclude Tesla and some other automakers, a spokesman for the governor. That's because Tesla already has a significant share of the market in California, and the program is designed to spur market innovation and competition, said the spokesman. Those decisions would be subject to negotiations with the legislature.
Last week, the state's nonpartisan fiscal adviser said that the budget was now "roughly balanced," but warned that "this year's budget does not have capacity for new commitments." Funding for a revived rebate would most likely come from the state's "cap and trade" program, in which industrial polluters buy and sell emissions credits. That fund has generated as much as $ 5 billion a year and has been used to underwrite an assortment of climate programs, from wildfire prevention to high-speed rail.
As it has in the past, the California Air Resources Board would most likely set the terms of any new rebate program, including what the rebate amount would be, whether it would apply to all makes of vehicles and whether there would be income restrictions.
California has been a leader in electric vehicle adoption. The top five cities in the United States with the highest numbers of registered electric vehicles have all been in California.
In 2023, electric vehicles accounted for more than 30 percent of auto registrations in the San Francisco Bay Area, according to S&P Global Mobility, which provides data analysis to the automotive industry. In Los Angeles, that number was close to 25 percent. This year, California surpassed two million zero-emissions vehicles sold.
Those numbers are set to grow; California is requiring that by 2035 all new cars and light trucks sold must be zero-emissions vehicles. By the same year, half of all new heavy trucks sold in the state must be electric.
The suggestion that the federal tax credit is fleeting has motivated some potential buyers to act.
Clio Bavalee, who lives near Santa Cruz, said she and her husband decided a few months ago to buy a hybrid car after theirs broke down. They have a Nissan Leaf but want a larger hybrid sedan they can take on road trips in remote areas where they may need to use gas.
Ms. Bavalee, 67, who works for Hewlett-Packard, said the couple would typically spend months researching cars to buy. But now they're racing to pick something before Inauguration Day.
"The clock is ticking because we feel like these rebates are what has made the difference for us to be able to buy the E.V.s," Ms. Bavalee said. "The fear that these rebates will go away is making it so that we're really under pressure to figure out and buy."
Alvin Shin, the president of the Tesla Owners East Bay car club, has been telling members for weeks that if they are planning to buy another E.V., now is the time.
"If they are going to make a decision, they should make it by the end of the year," Mr. Shin said. "Better now than the unknown."
Mr. Shin said that the 2,000 members of the Tesla car club have for days been discussing in their private Facebook group the possibility that the credit could be rolled back, a particularly hot-button issue given Elon Musk, who owns Tesla and is an adviser to Mr. Trump, wants the credit killed.
Christopher Bowe, a senior manager at FedEx who lives in Hayward, Calif., received a $ 7,500 federal tax credit and $ 2,000 in state credits when he bought a Ford F-150 Lightning in 2022. The rebates made it possible for Mr. Bowe to afford the $ 69,000 truck, his first electric vehicle.
Mr. Bowe and his wife, who is a schoolteacher, are planning to buy a second electric vehicle in 2026. They have set their sights on a new Rivian S.U.V., expected to be released that year, to replace their 11-year-old gas-powered S.U.V. Without the federal rebates, Mr. Bowe worries he won't be able to fit the purchase into his budget.
"We were counting on that federal tax rebate credit," Mr. Bowe, 50, said. "We're not in the position where we can easily afford these things if not for some of these programs."

Full text: Earlier this year, the comedian and media personality Kareem Rahma decided to double the output of his internet talk show, "Subway Takes," from two episodes per week to four. What he couldn't remember was why.
"Ummm, I kind of was like ..." Rahma said, trailing off during an interview at his home in Brooklyn this summer. "I don't know," he concluded with a laugh.
In his defense, it was a busy time. Including "Subway Takes," a series of train-car conversations about people's peculiar personal beliefs, Rahma, 38, is the creator and host of three web series, fronts a rock band and stars in, co-wrote and co-produced a feature film that premiered last month. In March, he welcomed his first child -- a daughter -- which, now that he thinks of it, had been the motivation for doubling down on "Subway Takes."
"I thought, 'I need to turn this into something that might actually benefit me," he said. "Both financially and in terms of, like, a proper career."
The gambit paid off. In May, "Subway Takes" was a moderately successful but niche production, with about 300,000 followers across TikTok and Instagram. Now that following has more than tripled -- over 928,000 -- and both the show and Rahma have entered a new stratum of viral fame.
New Yorkers can be heard on the street and in bars auditioning their own "Subway Takes." Brands including H & M, Urban Outfitters, KOTN and J. Crew have paid to outfit Rahma and his guests. And the status symbol of the season came in August -- an invitation to interview both Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota.
As he has gained access to famous names, Rahma has also faced new challenges, including how to preserve the populist spirit of his creation while building a successful business and tangling with more powerful partners. A "proper career" is a noble goal. Surviving in the content industry is a grind.
The Allure of the Take
The premise of "Subway Takes" is simple. Rahma, wearing a signature, oversized suit and sporty sunglasses, rides the train with a guest who offers, and then must defend, an unusual or provocative viewpoint. The 'takes' are generally entertaining and often absurd ("abolish shorts"), eccentric ("America has gotten soft since we stopped drinking whole milk") or incendiary ("'Ghosting' is fine").
But the essence of the show is the defense. In 90 seconds or less, "Subway Takes" (and, to an even greater degree, its half-hour YouTube spinoff, "The Last Stop") routinely captures something that the average cry for attention on the internet never does -- an actual human being mapping the nonsensical course of a train of thought.
On the day that I first met Rahma, he was preparing to fly to Pittsburgh to interview the vice president and her running mate. Although Rahma felt gratified to have the attention of a potential future president, he also had reservations.
Excepting the occasional celebrity (Olivia Wilde, Charli XCX), the majority of guests on "Subway Takes" had been relative unknowns by design. The engine of the show, Rahma pointed out, is the take, not the take artist.
Rahma also had policy concerns. As a Muslim and an Arab, he objected to the Biden administration's support for Israel's war in Gaza, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians -- including many women and children -- since Hamas's attack on Israel last October, in which 1,200 people were killed and over 200 were kidnapped. In three phone calls with Harris's staff and the Democratic National Committee, he said, he had proposed raising the conflict with the vice president -- perhaps at the end of the episode -- but was rejected.
Because he is not a professional journalist, Rahma, like other content creators who have interviewed presidential candidates, isn't beholden to common editorial standards enforced by traditional news media outlets, including rules against the exclusion of topics as a precondition for an interview. He ultimately agreed to the campaign's terms, reasoning that he could choose not to publish the video if it made him feel uneasy.
Rahma is 6 feet tall, with a head of buoyant black curls, and in near-constant motion -- either walking, talking, using his hands, or some combination of the three. "Subway Takes" is the second series he has created with transportation at its center. The first, "Keep the Meter Running," in which he hails a cab and asks the driver to take him to his or her favorite place in the city, has nearly 500,000 followers.
Rahma considers that show -- a compendium of life-affirming conversations with working-class and immigrant New Yorkers -- to be his true calling. (The comedian and actor Ramy Youssef has signed on to produce a television adaptation.)
He started "Subway Takes" almost as a whim, after a conversation in the spring of last year with his friend Andrew Kuo -- the show's co-creator. Rahma wanted a platform for his comedian friends, and Kuo suggested setting it on the subway.
"It makes the subway and New York seem as interesting as you hope they would be," Kuo said.
"Subway Takes" shares some DNA with a genre of "man-on-the-street" video that has proliferated on social media. A person with a microphone interrogates passers-by about their outfits, or their jobs, or their favorite place to buy a bagel. Often, the ultimate beneficiary of these videos is consumerism -- viewers learn new and more exquisite ways to spend their money. But the revelations on "Subway Takes" are internal. In some ways, it is a closer relative of the "home tour" genre. In lieu of granting a peek at a stranger's quirky bedroom, it shines a light on the dark corridors of their mind.
Rahma employs an assistant producer and typically hires two cameramen and an editor for his shows. He has been making "Keep the Meter Running" at a loss, he said. But, this year, sponsorships for "Subway Takes" have earned enough to support his family.
The Striver's Inheritance
Rahma was born in Cairo to Egyptian parents and raised in a suburb outside St. Paul, Minn. His mother ran a day care out of his childhood home and his father was a serial entrepreneur. In Rahma's memory, his father -- who worked at various times as a gas station owner, a truck driver, an exporter and a vegetable farmer -- was always one step away from his big break.
"I remember going to Egypt with him and carrying duffel bags full of Levi's jeans or stacks of oil paintings that he wanted to sell," he said. "He was trying to achieve the American dream and it never really panned out."
Youssef, who was born in New York to Egyptian immigrants, said he recognized the Rahmas' blend of optimism and hustle.
"It's called being Egyptian," he said. "In Cairo, there's so much happening around you that it always kind of feels like you're on this surfboard of life, just trying to grab whatever wave is coming your way."
In high school, Rahma worked as a telemarketer for a furnace and duct cleaning company, at McDonald's and as a busboy at the Pool and Yacht Club in St. Paul. While in college at the University of Minnesota (he studied journalism and advertising), he started a side business flipping motorcycles that he bought with student loan money.
After his father died, in 2007, Rahma stayed home to help his mother and two younger siblings. He left for New York in 2012 and pursued a corporate life in social media marketing at Vice and The New York Times. (In an April post on Instagram, Rahma accused a Times Cooking video of mimicking "Keep the Meter Running." The Times said in a statement that the video had not been based on Rahma's concept or work.) He later ran his own business -- a video content company with 20 employees called the Nameless Network -- but wound it down after a pandemic-inspired epiphany.
"I was depressed and I realized that I had been searching for a way to express myself," he said. "In high school, I worked. In college, I worked. I never went to Europe for five months and meandered around or did any of the things that people do when they're trying to figure out what they want to do."
Effectively unemployed at 33, Rahma rolled the dice on a long-suppressed passion -- stand-up comedy. One early supporter was Nicolas Heller, the film director and social media personality known as New York Nico, whose Instagram chronicles of the city's colorful characters inspired Rahma to create a signature franchise of his own.
"I had had all of these ideas in my notes app," he recalled. "One was, 'A show where you hang out with cabdrivers."'
Dreams Versus Reality
Two-and-a-half weeks after our initial meeting, I visited Rahma again. He seemed harried and wore a faded T-shirt and relaxed-fit jeans. The interview with Harris hadn't gone as planned.
What happened was a dispute over Harris's take. Rahma said he had been told that the vice president would be taking a stand against removing one's shoes on airplanes. When they sat down, however, Harris had surprised him with a different take: "Bacon is a spice." (Two senior campaign officials said this topic had been raised in advance. Rahma and his manager dispute this.)
Rahma, who doesn't eat pork for religious reasons, was taken aback. "I don't know," he says, in an unpublished video recording of the interview, his voice rising to an unusually high pitch. Harris elaborates that bits of cooked bacon can be used to enhance a meal like any other seasoning. "Think about it, it's pure flavor," she says.
Rahma asks Harris if he can use beef or turkey and what kinds of dishes would benefit from bacon. He then pauses the interview and tells her that he doesn't eat it. He asks if they can do the airplanes take instead. But, on the advice of a staffer, Harris decides to declare her love of anchovies on pizza -- an alternative the campaign had floated earlier in an email. Rahma wraps the discussion one minute later.
"Well," he says, with an awkward laugh. "I'm 100 percent unsure on both of those."
The Walz interview, in which the governor deplored the national decline of home gutter maintenance, went more smoothly. Afterward, Rahma said, he felt unsure of what to make of the sit-down with Harris. He had been apprehensive about potential criticism from other Muslims, and the bacon talk had thrown him off.
"It was so complicated because I'm Muslim and there's something going on in the world that 100 percent of Muslims care about," he said. "And then they made it worse by talking about anchovies. Boring!"
The campaign apologized for the bacon take and proposed a reshoot. But, after publishing the Walz interview, Rahma ultimately decided not to move forward with it.
"I never wanted to be a politics person," he said. "The more I think about it, the more I feel like I got lucky."
On the afternoon of our second meeting, Rahma was returning to his comfort zone by filming an episode of "Keep the Meter Running." He and two cameramen piled into the yellow Nissan minivan of a cabdriver named Afo, who planned to take them to his favorite Ghanaian restaurant in the Bronx.
Afo said he had emigrated from Accra in 1987. His first years in the city were rough -- two men robbed and assaulted him with a tire iron at his job as a gas station attendant -- but he found better employment as a carpet installer. Now 60, Afo had raised two children and worked as a taxi driver seven days a week for the past 17 years. He dreams of returning to Ghana and retiring on a small farm.
"I just want to live a simple life," he said. "No more rushing, no stress, just relax."
Noise from a dump truck in the next lane began seeping through the windows. Rahma, nervous about the audio recording, paused the conversation and asked Afo to pull away. His own simple life was still a distant fantasy. The cameraman next to him shifted his weight, stretching a leg that had fallen asleep. After nearly an hour, Afo exited the freeway in the South Bronx near Yankee Stadium. Rahma relaxed into his seat and looked at his watch.
"All right," he sighed. "Let's cut."

Divorces Late in Life Raise Financial Risks: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: When Margye Solomon decided to end her 33-year marriage last year, she knew her finances would take a big hit.
"I didn't have enough money to retire before I got divorced, and I have less now," said Ms. Solomon, who, at 71, still works full time as head of social enterprise and nonprofit partnerships at Ellevate, a global women's network.
Dividing assets evenly with her ex, a retired lawyer, left her with half as much in savings -- but, Ms. Solomon said, "my happiness was worth more to me than the money."
The 18 months since the split have been an exercise in frugality as Ms. Solomon rebuilds. To cut expenses, she moved from Nutley, N.J., to lower-cost Nashville, where she rents a small apartment in a friend's home; she bought a used Nissan to get around and watches her spending.
"When you divorce at this age, you can't be afraid to change your lifestyle," Ms. Solomon said. "In what could be a 100-year life, I figure I have 20 to 30 years left and I want to make the most of them."
Ms. Solomon has plenty of company. While divorce rates in the United States have generally been falling, they have doubled for people over age 50 since the 1990s and tripled among those over 65, according to a 2022 study from Bowling Green State University in Ohio. Longer life expectancies and a rise in older women working, which makes divorce more feasible economically, are helping to drive the trend. All told, nearly 40 percent of divorces now involve someone who qualifies for AARP membership.
These couples may be happier apart than together, but they have a lot to lose financially. Women can be hit especially hard: Wives who divorce after 50 see a 45 percent decline on average in their standard of living, versus a 21 percent drop for husbands of the same age -- and those losses can be persistent, a separate Bowling Green study found.
"Following these individuals for a decade after their divorce, we're not seeing appreciable recovery," said Susan Brown, a Bowling Green sociology professor who was one of the authors of the studies.
If you're divorcing after 50, how can you better prepare -- financially -- for the years ahead? "The key is coming to terms, both practically and emotionally, with the fact that your retirement is going to look different than what you thought it would be, and being willing to adjust accordingly," said Chris Chen, a certified divorce financial analyst in Newton, Mass.
These moves can help.
Get a Grip on Your New Reality
Reaching a fair settlement lays the groundwork for financial recovery after a later-in-life divorce. For that, you first need a handle on the income, assets and household expenses you're working with -- an exercise that can be unexpectedly challenging, particularly if one partner solely managed the finances.
"It can feel like the numbers are judging you," said Stephanie McCullough, a certified financial planner in Berwyn, Pa. "But it's to both parties' benefit to be as complete as possible, to see what will be realistic going forward."
For Nancy Howell, 60, a former elementary schoolteacher who left money management mostly to her pilot husband during their 37-year marriage, this financial fact-finding exercise felt like "a gut punch," she said, as she learned her name wasn't on the mortgage and some other accounts. "It was like I didn't exist," Ms. Howell said.
Ms. Howell, whose divorce was finalized last year, elected to keep her five-bedroom home in Tempe, Ariz., as part of the settlement and got spousal support to help maintain it. But once her ex-husband retires later this month and the support payments stop, Ms. Howell, who works part-time as a substitute and after-school teacher, will have to tap into her retirement savings to afford the upkeep on the house.
"In retrospect, keeping the house was a really bad call, given that it's just me and the dog now," said Ms. Howell, who has three adult children. "I would have more financial flexibility and confidence if I downsized by half."
Focus on the Biggest Assets
One spouse hanging onto the house -- which, along with retirement accounts, are typically the most valuable assets that couples hold -- is common, divorce experts said. But it's often a financial mistake, especially if the children are grown.
That's because you typically have to trade a portion of retirement savings to buy out the other spouse at a time when you're close to winding down a career or may already have stopped working, said Lili Vasileff, a certified divorce financial analyst in Greenwich, Conn. And, the most pressing financial need after a split is typically cash flow, so tying up funds in an illiquid asset isn't helpful.
"I ask clients, 'If the house will eat up 70 percent of your income, are you willing to sacrifice 70 percent of everything else in your budget to keep it?"' Ms. Vasileff said.
Where you live plays a critical role in how retirement plans such as individual retirement accounts, pensions and 401(k)s are divided. In the country's nine community property states -- including Arizona, California and Texas -- retirement assets acquired during the marriage will be split evenly. Elsewhere, state guidelines suggest a fair distribution based on factors such as the length of the marriage and each spouse's financial situation.
State law also usually provides a formula for whether spousal support should be awarded, taking into account the length of the marriage and how much time a lower-earning or stay-at-home spouse needs to become self-supporting. An important additional factor for older couples: how long the higher earner has until retirement, when support typically ends, no matter how long the couple was married.
"That's a rude awakening for many older people, primarily women, who end up with fewer years of support than expected," Ms. Vasileff said.
Aim to Be Amicable
You're not obligated, though, to follow the state guidelines. Everything is negotiable.
You can also negotiate matters that aren't covered by state law, such as compensating a lower-earning partner for the loss of future Social Security benefits or health insurance. By federal law, a divorced spouse is typically entitled to up to half of her ex-partner's benefit at full retirement, as long as they were married for at least 10 consecutive years; half of his benefit would be greater than what she would qualify for on her own; and she has not remarried. But that's far less than what she would have access to if she were still married: her spouse's full benefit, as well as her own smaller one.
"That's a real whammy for women, who are more often the lower-earning spouse," said Nancy Hetrick, a certified divorce financial analyst in Phoenix.
You can seek a larger share of a retirement account or other assets to help offset the impact of reduced Social Security benefits. But that strategy has the best chance of success, Ms. Hetrick said, if you opt for a mediated or collaborative divorce. A bonus to that approach: Mediation costs much less than a litigated settlement.
Jeff Fleisher, 69, has learned this lesson the hard way. A retired information technology director from Windsor, Calif., Mr. Fleisher and his wife of 29 years divorced this year, but they haven't finalized a financial agreement. The assets still being negotiated: an inherited I.R.A. and other investments that Mr. Fleisher said were separate property he acquired before the marriage. Both parties have retained lawyers, and Mr. Fleisher's legal fees have so far exceeded $ 50,000, he said.
"Lawyers are not the panacea -- they're there to make money," Mr. Fleisher said. "My advice is: If there's any way to just work out a deal with your ex, do it."
Rethink Your Lifestyle
To manage the financial hit of a later-in-life divorce, you basically have two choices, Ms. Hetrick said: "Redo your retirement plans considerably and scale back on some things you thought you'd do, or figure out how to make more money -- or both."
If you have a job, you can make up ground by postponing your retirement date. "Working even for a couple of years more can make miracles happen financially," Mr. Chen said.
Already retired? Ageism or health issues may preclude returning to work full-time, but even a part-time gig can be helpful. "Every dollar that comes in is a dollar you don't need to spend from savings," Ms. McCullough said.
You might also consider putting some settlement money toward professional development. Adding a certification or technical skill can help you earn more to pad savings.
That's what Gillian Overton, 65, has done in the 10 years since her divorce. A former high school teacher, Ms. Overton used part of her settlement -- she received half of her ex-husband's pension as well as spousal support until he retired 18 months ago -- to retrain as a therapist, which she hopes will allow her to extend her career.
Ms. Overton, who relocated to her native England a few years ago from Far Hills, N.J., has lived comfortably since the divorce. But she is worried now that alimony has ended. "I feel like I'm looking into the abyss, wondering if my money will last," she said. "It's scary doing this on your own."
Still, she said, she's satisfied with the path she's chosen -- and experts say that's a sentiment they often hear from clients who divorce in their later years. "The process is not just about rebuilding your nest egg," Ms. McCullough said. "It's about rebuilding your life in a way that's more deeply satisfying for you."

Mexico Car Plants and Suppliers Brace for Tariffs: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Until a few years ago there was not much in this patch of desert 250 miles north of Mexico City but rattlesnakes, coyotes and cactus. Today, it is gleaming evidence of the country's growing importance as an auto producer.
In 2019, BMW completed a vast factory complex here, near the city of San Luis Potosí. As spotless and modern as any in Bavaria, the plant builds luxury sedans for the United States, Europe, China and dozens of other markets.
San Luis Potosí is one of several Mexican cities that have become little Detroits, producing Volkswagens, Audis, Mercedes-Benzes, Fords, Nissans and Chevrolets. In the first nine months of this year, Mexican factories produced more than three million vehicles, of which two million were exported to the United States, according to the Mexican Automobile Industry Association.
But Mexico's pivotal role in the global auto industry is now at risk. President-elect Donald J. Trump has threatened to impose punitive tariffs of 100 percent or higher on cars from Mexico, which would violate a trade agreement his first administration negotiated with Canada and Mexico.
The consequences for the auto industry would be profound, affecting the price in the United States of popular models like Ford Maverick pickups, Chevrolet Equinox sport utility vehicles and several variations of Ram trucks.
Mr. Trump has said the tariffs would encourage more automotive manufacturing in the United States. And BMW executives say that the tariffs would hurt their business but that the plant in San Luis Potosí would still make financial sense for the company, because so many of the cars produced there are sold in other countries.
But the tariffs could severely disrupt suppliers, forcing them to move production between countries, which could lead to job losses and financial turmoil. The BMW factory in San Luis Potosí has 3,700 employees.
"If you torpedo the agreement, you're going to create more unemployed Mexicans, and what are they going to do?" said William Alan Reinsch, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who specializes in trade issues.
Trade barriers might also be a setback for the already slowing electric vehicle business. Ford produces its battery-powered Mustang Mach-E at a factory near Mexico City. Chevrolet produces electric versions of the Equinox and Blazer S.U.V.s near Monterrey.
Even Tesla, which is led by one of Mr. Trump's biggest supporters, Elon Musk, could feel the effects. The company bought land in Monterrey to build a car factory in order to produce affordable vehicles, though that project is on hold, local officials say.
The BMW complex in San Luis Potosí shows what is at stake for automakers. Last month, construction crews swarmed around freshly erected steel girders, the skeleton of a new building where battery modules will be assembled for the German company's electric vehicles. BMW will produce those cars in San Luis Potosí beginning in 2027 and export them to the United States and elsewhere. The factory currently produces BMW 2 Series and 3 Series sedans.
The city of San Luis Potosí, a sprawling jumble of cinder-block and brick buildings, doesn't exactly scream "high-tech manufacturing hub." Makeshift taquerias crowd the shoulders of the highway that leads to the BMW complex. The road is lined with corrugated metal factory buildings, many of which churn out auto parts. Like many Mexican cities, San Luis Potosí has suffered drug cartel violence.
But BMW executives said Mexico offered a deep pool of well-educated workers and suppliers. "You don't only have skilled workers, but you have very motivated workers," said Ilka Horstmeier, a member of BMW's management board whose responsibilities include labor relations, during an interview in San Luis Potosí.
Mexican suppliers are able to fulfill the demands of BMW's tightly choreographed manufacturing operation, delivering parts like bumpers, axles or seats just four hours before the parts are installed in cars, said Oliver Haase, a senior vice president who oversees the company's supply network in North America and South America.
Mexican suppliers are held to the same standard as those in Europe, the United States or Asia, Mr. Haase said. If he was led blindfolded into a Mexican parts factory without knowing where in the world he was, "I could not tell you," he said.
The San Luis Potosí plant is highly automated, with armies of orange robots welding body frames together amid showers of sparks. But manual labor still plays a role. On the assembly line, workers in blue uniforms thread bolts by hand to connect front hoods to their hinges.
Trade barriers could disrupt a supply chain that also benefits the U.S. economy. Many of the parts used in BMWs and other Mexican-made cars come from the United States. Batteries for the new BMW electric cars will come from a factory in South Carolina that also supplies the company's plant in Spartanburg, S.C.
Labor representatives in the United States, who have pushed for higher tariffs, complain that Mexico's lack of worker protections is one reason for its appeal. Traditionally, Mexican unions have answered to management and government officials rather than workers.
The first Trump administration pursued policies that many labor experts said had hurt workers and unions. But the administration's officials did push for provisions in the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, known as the U.S.M.C.A., that required Mexico to make it easier for workers to form independent unions.
Mexican labor leaders have used the reform to organize autoworkers at companies like General Motors and Goodyear, which has a large tire factory in San Luis Potosí.
"The law gives us tools to organize for better conditions," Pablo Franco, a lawyer who represents La Liga Sindical Obrera Mexicana, an independent labor group, said in an interview at a hotel in San Luis Potosí where he and other labor representatives were meeting with Goodyear executives.
But Mr. Franco also complained that the government had not done enough to ensure that workers were aware of their rights. Workers at most companies, including BMW, are not represented by independent unions.
The penalty for not complying with provisions of the U.S.M.C.A. is small. BMW and other companies that do not meet all of the terms of the agreement, including those related to unions and where they buy parts from, pay a 2.5 percent tariff to export vehicles to the United States.
Lately Chinese automakers including BYD have been scouting locations in Mexico with an eye toward establishing a presence in Latin America and, eventually, the United States. Many were waiting for the outcome of U.S. elections before deciding whether to build plants in Mexico, local officials say.
In theory, factories in Mexico could give Chinese carmakers an entree to the United States. Punitive tariffs and other restrictions effectively ban cars made in China from the United States. But the Trump administration is unlikely to allow Chinese companies access to the United States so easily.
Mexican officials are courting Chinese investors, but they are also mindful that the United States is Mexico's largest trading partner by far.
The United States, Mexico and Canada are scheduled to review the U.S.M.C.A. in 2026 and decide whether to extend the treaty.
"We are going to be very respectful of the commercial agreements we have with the United States and Canada," said Walter Ángel, who oversees Mexico's energy regulator and is involved in efforts by the government to promote electric cars. He added, "We are going to review the treaty, but we are not going to renegotiate the treaty."
Representatives for Mr. Trump did not respond to a request for comment.
BMW executives said the factory in San Luis Potosí made business sense no matter what officials from the three countries decided. They point out that much of the plant's output goes to Brazil, other Latin American countries and China. The two-door version of the BMW 2 Series coupe sold in Europe is produced in San Luis Potosí. Mexico has free-trade agreements that allow manufacturers to export their products to 50 countries at low or zero tariffs.
"Our decision on where we build plants is a long-term strategic decision made for at least 40 years," Ms. Horstmeier of BMW's management board said. But she added that the company much preferred open borders. "Whenever you put up trade barriers," she said, "you harm yourself."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Beyoncé and Taylor Swift will face off in all top categories at the 67th annual Grammy Awards, leading a pack of nominees that also features buzzy young female stars who have dominated the pop charts over the past year.
With 11 nods, Beyoncé has more citations than any other artist this year, for “Cowboy Carter,” her gumbo of country, R&B and acoustic pop that spurred conversations about the Black roots of many American genres, including country.
The other top nominees, with seven apiece, are Billie Eilish, a onetime teenage disrupter who is now a Grammy and Oscar darling; Kendrick Lamar, the rapper laureate, whose nominations stem from a no-holds-barred battle of words with Drake; Post Malone, a pop shape-shifter gone country (and who appeared on both Beyoncé’s and Swift’s latest albums); and Charli XCX, the British singer-songwriter and meme master whose digital-nostalgic iconography was borrowed by the Kamala Harris campaign.
Swift has six nominations, as do Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan — two of this year’s fresh pop sensations, each receiving their first Grammy nods.
The awards ceremony is set for Feb. 2 in Los Angeles.
The biggest contest this year, at least in terms of celebrity wattage, is Beyoncé vs. Swift. Both are juggernauts in the culture and at the Grammys. With 32 career trophies, Beyoncé, 43, has already won more awards than any other artist and is now also the most-nominated person, with 99. Yet she has never taken album of the year, despite four previous nods.
The competition between Beyoncé and Swift may well invoke the Grammys’ complex history with race, which has come up in recent years, as Beyoncé has lost the top prize to Adele and Harry Styles.
At the most recent ceremony, Jay-Z, her husband, scolded the Grammys for its poor historical record of rewarding Black artists and dourly noted Beyoncé’s four losses in album of the year. “Think about that,” he said.
Last year, Swift, 34, claimed her fourth win of that award (for “Midnights”), eclipsing Frank Sinatra, Stevie Wonder and Paul Simon for the most victories in the Grammys’ most prestigious category. She has a total of 14 career wins and since the 2021 awards has logged 24 nominations for her huge volume of output — four studio albums, four rerecorded LPs and a mountain of bonus tracks — since the pandemic began.
For album of the year, “Cowboy Carter” and Swift’s “The Tortured Poets Department” — which she announced from the stage at the last Grammy ceremony, in February — will compete against Carpenter’s “Short n’ Sweet,” Charli XCX’s “Brat,” Eilish’s “Hit Me Hard and Soft,” Roan’s “The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess” and two niche entries: “Djesse Vol. 4,” by multi-instrumentalist Jacob Collier, and “New Blue Sun,” the new-age flute album by André 3000 of the beloved hip-hop group Outkast.
Despite their many nominations over the years, this is only the second time Beyoncé and Swift have competed directly in the top album category. In 2010, Swift took that award for the first time with “Fearless,” beating Beyoncé’s “I Am … Sasha Fierce.”
The record of the year category this year, for a single recording, pits Beyoncé’s “Texas Hold ’Em” and Swift’s “Fortnight” (which features Post Malone) against some of the year’s ubiquitous singles: Carpenter’s “Espresso,” Charli XCX’s “360,” Roan’s “Good Luck, Babe!” Lamar’s diss track “Not Like Us” and Eilish’s “Birds of a Feather.” The category also includes “Now and Then,” the Beatles’ “last” song, assembled from a rough demo recording left by John Lennon.
Song of the year, a songwriters’ award, has nods for “Fortnight,” “Texas Hold ’Em,” “Birds of a Feather,” “Good Luck, Babe!” and “Not Like Us”; along with “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” a chart-dominating country hit by Shaboozey, who appeared on “Cowboy Carter”; Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars’ “Die With a Smile”; and another Carpenter hit, “Please Please Please.”
For best new artist, Carpenter, Roan and Shaboozey will face off against British songwriter and performer Raye; Florida-born rapper Doechii; mellow-groove Texas trio Khruangbin; singer-songwriter Teddy Swims; and Benson Boone, a rock singer who had a No. 2 hit this year with “Beautiful Things.”
Beyoncé has a wide field of genre nominations this year, covering pop, rap, country and Americana for various tracks on “Cowboy Carter.”
Her LP was largely ignored by the Nashville, Tennessee, establishment, garnering minimal airplay on country radio stations and being shut out of the Country Music Association Awards. But it is up for best country album at the Grammys, in a contest that may test the regional factionalism of the Recording Academy, the organization behind the awards.
She will compete against Post Malone (“F-1 Trillion”), Chris Stapleton (“Higher”), Lainey Wilson (“Whirlwind”) and a previous album of the year winner, Kacey Musgraves (“Deeper Well”). Zach Bryan, an admired songwriter with one foot in Nashville, reportedly declined to submit his hit album “The Great American Bar Scene” for the awards. (At the most recent ceremony, “I Remember Everything,” his duet with Musgraves, won best country duo/group performance.)
For years — decades, even — the Grammys have come under fire for failing to recognize Black performers in the top categories and for being out of touch with the winds of pop culture, leading to stars like Drake, the Weeknd and Frank Ocean saying they would boycott the awards.
In an attempt to remedy that, the Recording Academy has streamlined its nominations process and solicited thousands of new members. The academy recently announced that 66% of its 13,000 current voting members have joined since 2019 — among them 3,000 women — and that 38% of its overall electorate are now people of color.
In an interview, Harvey Mason Jr., the academy’s CEO, said those changes are key to the Grammys achieving “the right outcomes.”
“Without our members, we have nothing, because the members and the voters are what make up our nominations,” Mason said. “They’re what make up our elected leadership. So without the right membership, everything else breaks down.”
The nominees for songwriter of the year, non-classical, a recently added category intended to recognize non-performing songwriters, include Raye; country writers Jessi Alexander and Jessie Jo Dillon; in-demand Latin creator Edgar Barrera; and Amy Allen, who has penned hits for Carpenter, Olivia Rodrigo and others.
For producer of the year, non-classical, Daniel Nigro, who works with Roan and Rodrigo, is up against Alissia (Jamila Woods, Rae Khalil); Ian Fitchuk (Beyoncé, Musgraves); Mustard (Lamar); and Dernst Emile II, known as D’Mile (Lady Gaga and Mars).
For best pop vocal album, Carpenter, Eilish, Swift and Roan will face Ariana Grande’s “Eternal Sunshine.” Green Day, Pearl Jam, the Rolling Stones, Idles, Jack White, the Black Crowes and Fontaines D.C. will compete for best rock album. And for best rap album, Eminem, Doechii and J. Cole will go up against a joint release by Common and Pete Rock, and another by Future and Metro Boomin (“We Don’t Trust You”).
Ricky Gervais, Dave Chappelle, Jim Gaffigan, Nikki Glaser and Trevor Noah are up for best comedy album, and the award for best audiobook, narration and storytelling recording will go to Dolly Parton, Barbra Streisand, Jimmy Carter, funk lion George Clinton or producer Guy Oldfield (for “All You Need Is Love: The Beatles in Their Own Words”).
This year’s awards will be broadcast live from the Crypto.com Arena by CBS and streamed on Paramount+. Last week, the Recording Academy announced that starting in 2027, it will move to ABC, Hulu and Disney+, after more than 50 years with CBS.
A total of 20,309 eligible entries were submitted for the Grammys’ 94 categories this year, and voting members of the academy will cast their ballots for the awards starting in January.
For a second year in a row, the window of eligibility for the awards is 50 weeks, just short of a full year, with the academy accepting submissions of recordings released from Sept. 16, 2023, to Aug. 30, 2024.

Spain and China Strengthen Ties as a Trade War Looms: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Spain is forging a path as a "connector" country, drawing Chinese investment as it abstained from taking a position on European tariffs on electric cars.
In January, the Catalan regional government in Spain created a specialized desk dedicated to increasing investment and trade with China, the world's second-largest economy.
In July, the Port of Barcelona approved plans to build a terminal with direct access to the port's railway for electric vehicles that China is exporting to Europe.
Last month, during a visit to Beijing by Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, the Chinese wind turbine giant Envision Energy agreed to team up with his government and invest $ 1 billion to build a green hydrogen industrial park.
The activity is a sign of how Spain is trying to expand its economic ties with China when tensions with the West are growing.
"China is a key economic partner" for the European Union and Spain, Carlos Cuerpo, Spain's economic minister, said from his office in Madrid. "Europe has to find its own way."
It is a hard path to locate these days. This week, Europe is increasing tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles to as much as 45 percent. The European Union maintains that government subsidies have enabled Chinese companies to sell their cars at cut-rate prices, threatening the bloc's own industry.
The vote splintered the European Union's 27 members, drawing support from France and opposition from Germany. Spain, the union's fourth-largest economy, was among 12 countries that abstained, reflecting how China is viewed as both an economic opportunity and a threat.
To skeptics, China's attempts to inundate Europe with cheap, subsidized solar panels and electric vehicles imperil industries that are essential to the continent's prosperity. Meanwhile, its support for Russia since the invasion of Ukraine undermines Europe's security.
"This is not only about commercial interests but also geopolitical interests," said Liana Fix, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. Europe has to be careful not to become too dependent on Chinese industry and materials, she said.
In her view, Spain is taking a pragmatic approach by engaging in joint ventures that give its companies access to China's advanced technology.
When it comes to critical industries including automobiles and agriculture, Mr. Cuerpo, the economics minister, said, "Spain has to do its own analysis."
Such assessments are happening in capitals around the world as officials and businesses try to figure out how to keep their economies pumping when rivalries between the world's superpowers are sharpening.
The freewheeling global economic system that turbocharged international trade and investment has been profoundly shaken, first by the pandemic and then by wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. And governments are struggling to balance their desire for economic growth with concerns about national security, international alliances and supply chain resilience.
The cycle of tariffs and retaliation between the United States and China that began in 2018 under President Donald J. Trump has escalated to affect hundreds of billions of dollars of goods. In May, the Biden administration placed a 100 percent tariff on electric vehicles from China.
The effects are rippling throughout the world's economy.
Nonaligned countries like Mexico and Vietnam have experienced rapid jumps in Chinese trade and investment and, in turn, have increased their exports to the United States. Such so-called connector countries serve "as a bridge between blocs," a way for Chinese firms to get their goods into the United States but avoid import duties, said Gita Gopinath, the first deputy managing director at the International Monetary Fund.
A similar dynamic can be seen in Europe.
"China's strategy is clear," said Josep Maria Gomes, international business manager at the chamber of commerce in Barcelona. "Chinese companies are coming to Europe to solve the problems with trade barriers."
China has been increasing foreign direct investment and completing more mergers and acquisitions.
This spring, Chery, a carmaker owned by China's Wuhu municipal government, signed a 400-million-euro agreement with the Spanish company Ebro-EV Motors. The two will produce electric vehicles at a shuttered Nissan plant in Barcelona.
Mr. Gomes is optimistic that Spain will beat out competitors and land another deal with the state-owned Chinese carmaker MG to build an electric automobile factory.
Chinese auto manufacturers have also struck agreements to produce electric vehicle plants in Turkey, Hungary and Poland.
By producing cars on the continent, Chinese companies can sidestep tariffs. Local manufacturers get access to China's know-how.
Chinese producers clearly have "superior technology," said Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Brussels. European firms that steer clear of them risk "missing out."
Cooperation, though, can also give China leverage. After the European Union voted to impose tariffs, Chery announced that production in Spain would be postponed for a year. Spanish government officials dismissed the idea that the delay was meant to signal displeasure.
Spain has long been overshadowed by the larger economies of Germany, France and Italy, but grew more than three times as much as the European Union's average last year. Last week, the International Monetary Fund estimated that Spain's economy would grow 2.9 percent this year, the largest increase of any major advanced industrialized nation in the West. The estimate for Germany, traditionally the engine of European growth, was zero.
The automobile industry is considered essential to Spain's economic success. Already the second-largest manufacturer in Europe after Germany, Spain exported 87 percent of its automotive production last year.
Investment and trade with the United States still dwarf investment and trade between Spain and China. And there is a risk that European cars produced with Chinese technology could be shut out of the American market because of security concerns.
Still, there is "huge potential" in the relationship with China, said Marta Blanco, president of the international relations committee at the Spanish Confederation of Business Organizations, a trade association that represents more than two million companies and businesspeople.
And for Chinese investors, Spain's longstanding cultural and economic ties to other Spanish-speaking countries mean that it can also serve as a gateway to Latin America -- a region where countries engage with China despite concerns about its flooding their markets with exports.
Chinese direct investment in Spain has been growing over the last decade, more than doubling to nearly $ 12 billion since 2017. The agreement with Envision followed an announcement by the Chinese-owned manufacturer Hygreen Energy to invest more than $ 2 billion on hydrogen generation projects in southern Spain.
Spain, which already generates more than 60 percent of its electricity from renewable sources, wants to become a leader in producing clean energy for Europe.
Maintaining good relations with China is also a major concern for many agricultural producers in Spain.
"China is an essential market," said Daniel de Miguel, deputy director of Interporc, the association of pork producers. Spain exported more than 500,000 tons of white pork to China last year, a quarter of the sector's total exports, according to the association.
And worries about an escalating trade war between Europe and China are palpable.
Within days of the vote to impose tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, Beijing announced a temporary tariff on European brandy. The Chinese government has also opened an investigation into whether the European pork industry is exporting to China at low prices that violate trade rules.
"We are really nervous," said Mr. de Miguel, who was part of a delegation that accompanied Spain's prime minister on his trip in September. After the visit, Mr. Sánchez switched his position on the European Union's electric vehicle tariffs, which he previously publicly said he supported.
Like other European countries whose economies depend on global exports and supply chains, Spain is trying to walk a thin line between cooperation and competition with China.
"We have to be open but not naïve," Mr. Cuerpo, the economics minister, said.

Canada Orders TikTok
To Shut Down Its Offices
The Canadian government on Wednesday directed the video app TikTok, which is owned by a Chinese tech giant, to close its offices in the country because of national security risks.
The app, hugely popular around the world, will still be available for people to use in Canada, said François-Philippe Champagne, the innovation minister, right.
The decision, based on the advice of Canada's security and intelligence community, was meant to address the risks posed by ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, Mr. Champagne said.
Canadian law provides for extra official scrutiny of foreign investments that could endanger national security, Mr. Champagne said.
TikTok said it intended to challenge the order in court.
TikTok faces an outright ban in the United States, as soon as January, over government concerns about security, data privacy and misinformation.
As TikTok's influence with young people has become inescapable, lawmakers in Washington have expressed concern that China could use the app to fuel misinformation. They are also worried that the app could share sensitive user data like location and browsing history with the Chinese government.
Canada banned TikTok from government-issued mobile devices last year. But the app remains one of the most popular in Canada, where it has been downloaded about 700,000 times a month recently. MEAGHAN TOBIN

Nissan Cuts 9,000 Jobs And Slashes C.E.O.'s Pay
Nissan Motor said Thursday that it was planning deep cuts to its global operations as it seeks to reorient its business and recover ground lost in the growing markets for hybrid and electric vehicles in China and the United States.
The Japanese automaker said it would slash 9,000 jobs and reduce its global production capacity by 20 percent. Nissan's chief executive, Makoto Uchida, will take a 50 percent pay cut in his monthly compensation.
Nissan reported on Thursday that global sales declined across its core markets -- North America, China, and Japan -- in the first half of its fiscal year. Nissan's operating profit fell 90 percent, to $ 214 million, during the April-to-September period.
Like many of its peers, including Ford Motor in the United States and Volkswagen in Germany, Nissan has struggled to keep pace with rapidly changing consumer preferences in some of the world's largest car markets.
In China, growing demand for electric vehicles is being largely met by local brands such as BYD, which have churned out low-cost models tailored to the domestic market. The shift has displaced many traditional automakers, including Volkswagen, which had long dominated sales there.
In the United States, electric vehicle sales growth has slowed in recent years, but consumers are increasingly opting for hybrid gas-electric vehicles. This has provided a boost for Toyota, but has hurt sales for automakers like General Motors and Nissan, which lack similar offerings. RIVER AKIRA DAVIS

Election Results Tug at Japan's Political Stability: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Deep-seated grievance among Japanese voters has put the Liberal Democrats, longstanding custodians of the status quo, on notice.
For years, Japan has managed to resist the populist waves that have swept Europe and the United States as disaffected electorates have demanded radical change.
But as voters handed the longtime governing party of Japan a resounding blow in snap parliamentary elections on Sunday, there were signs that their frustration could convert one of the region's most stable democracies into a much more chaotic one.
On the surface, it appeared that the center had held. Even though the Liberal Democratic Party, which has dominated Japanese politics for most of the postwar era, lost its majority in the lower house of Parliament, the Constitutional Democrats, who won the second-most seats behind the L.D.P., are another relatively centrist party.
But minority parties on the far left and far right both gained seats. And while Shigeru Ishiba, who was selected by the Liberal Democrats as prime minister only a month ago, blamed the party's dismal showing on a protracted political finance scandal, analysts said the sense of grievance among voters went far deeper.
"The last 30 years of stagnation and the deterioration of the living standards, especially for young people -- the frustration is there," said Kunihiko Miyake, a former Japanese diplomat who is now a special adviser at the Canon Institute for Global Studies in Tokyo.
Mr. Miyake said that L.D.P.-led governments had so far managed to contain voter discontent over flat wages, labor shortages and a rapidly aging population. But now, he added, "the doomsday has come" to Japan. The Liberal Democrats, custodians of the status quo, have been put on notice.
"This is not a simple political money scandal," Mr. Miyake said. "It's much more structural and longer term."
The unaccustomed electoral disarray has left it unclear who will lead the government going forward. The hobbled L.D.P. has 30 days to try to bring more partners on board and form a ruling coalition. The opposition is seen as unlikely to be able to bridge its divides and put together a government.
Mr. Ishiba, 27 days into his prime ministership, was also facing questions about how long he will last. During a news conference on Monday, he acknowledged the "harsh criticism from the public" and promised to introduce more transparency in political fund-raising and accounting.
In many ways, pressure had been building for years under a deceptively placid political landscape, where it appeared that the Japanese public would put up with business as usual indefinitely.
Successive administrations led by Liberal Democrats "looked very stable, but these governments postponed real policy changes and left serious problems in the Japanese economy and society," said Jiro Yamaguchi, a political scientist at Hosei University in Tokyo.
With eight opposition parties winning seats, it will be very difficult for them to present a unified new vision for the country.
"The fragmentation and polarization of the party system appears to be starting from this election," Mr. Yamaguchi said. While choice can be one sign of political health, the potential for voters to flee to parties with more extreme positions could be "a very dangerous symptom for democracy," he added.
And although voters clearly wanted to send a message to the Liberal Democrats, it's not clear that they chose a consistent alternative.
"The diversity of parties that achieved gains in this election show that there's not one coherent vision for moving Japan forward," said Kristi Govella, an associate professor with the Nissan Institute of Japanese Studies at the University of Oxford.
Part of the reason the Liberal Democrats were able to weather public discontent for so long was that Shinzo Abe, a talented politician who was Japan's longest-serving prime minister, enforced party discipline and persuaded the public that stability was more important than sweeping change.
But after Mr. Abe was assassinated in 2022, the public grew increasingly disaffected by emerging scandals that had remained hidden. Mr. Abe's killer said he held a grudge against him because of the former prime minister's links to the Unification Church, a fringe religious group that had taken thousands of dollars from the gunman's mother.
Once the Japanese media swiftly revealed that dozens of Liberal Democratic lawmakers were also supported by the church's political arm, approval ratings for the party spiraled downward. The public grew even more disgruntled with the more recent political finance scandals.
Analysts said they were not sure the results from Sunday's election would improve the public mood or yield much substantive change.
"This isn't going to make the Japanese public feel happier about their democracy," said Tobias Harris, founder and principal of Japan Foresight, a consultancy in Washington.
If the Liberal Democrats end up forming a minority government along with their current coalition partner, Komeito, or recruiting a few minority parties through backroom negotiations, that "is not going to result in a whole lot of love for the government that comes out of it," Mr. Harris said.
Analysts said that even if Mr. Ishiba can retain the prime ministership, he will face significant challenges in his efforts to purge corruption from the party. Although he was selected as the L.D.P.'s leader because of his perceived public popularity and willingness to criticize his colleagues, during his few weeks in power, he has not shown an ability to clean house effectively.
More than 45 politicians were implicated in allegations of hiding proceeds from political fund-raisers and taking kickbacks, but Mr. Ishiba had announced that the party would withdraw its endorsement from just a dozen candidates in Sunday's election. And last week, the Japanese media revealed that the L.D.P. transferred 20 million yen -- about $ 131,000 -- to local branches of candidates who had lost the party's endorsement.
Mr. Ishiba faces opponents within his own party, which means "he can't make any reforms," said Mieko Nakabayashi, a professor of politics at Waseda University in Tokyo.
But "if the L.D.P. doesn't want to lose more seats, they should do something" before an upper house election scheduled for next summer, Ms. Nakabayashi said. "That was the message from the people."
On one front, at least, the election did not appear to cause much disruption. Regardless of what form a governing coalition takes, there is unlikely to be backtracking from the Liberal Democratic Party's recent moves to increase Japan's defense budget, restore relations with South Korea and stand firm with the world's richest democracies in backing Ukraine against the Russian invasion.
Rahm Emanuel, the United States ambassador to Japan, said he was confident that the alliance between the two countries would remain stable. "There are things that are locked in that are still contributing to the alliance and the deterrence effect of the alliance," Mr. Emanuel said.
But Shihoko Goto, director of the Indo-Pacific program at the Wilson Center in Washington, warned that Japan's inward turn to deal with domestic political instability could undermine its role as a bulwark in the region against rising threats from North Korea and China.
"The hope had been that Japan would continue to be an anchor," but the election results put that into question, Ms. Goto said.
What's more, she said, with the U.S. election just eight days away, "depending on what the results are in Japan and in the United States, there's going to be a great deal of uncertainty across the region."
Kiuko Notoya and Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.

Full text: Laura Baroni and Paul Keating, both avid surfers, met in Costa Rica and felt immediately connected, if not through their native languages.
In early 2022, Paul Thomas Keating and Laura Baroni each traveled to Costa Rica looking for something -- but not necessarily for someone. The two kicked around the small beach town of Santa Teresa, on the western coast, for more than a month before laying eyes on each other.
When they did, there were sparks but few words. At a dinner with mutual friends, Ms. Baroni, who is from Italy, was immediately intrigued by the handsome, curly-haired American. Shared glances prompted Ms. Baroni to pivot from English, of which she knew just a few words, to Spanish, in which she was fluent. Mr. Keating spoke Spanish passably, so it was in that language that they shared stories about how their paths had crossed.
Ms. Baroni, 27, grew up in Liguria, Italy. After earning a bachelor's degree in modern languages and cultures for business and tourism from the University of Genoa, she worked as a sales manager for a company that made biodegradable bags. But during the pandemic, she became hooked on surfing, and by the end of 2021, had bought a one-way ticket to Costa Rica and settled in Santa Teresa, which is known for its superb year-round waves.
At the time, Mr. Keating, 31, was a self-described surf bum. "I lived simply, or, you could also say, in poverty," he said jokingly. In Santa Teresa, he shared a home with several roommates and swarms of mosquitoes; to thwart the insects, he slept inside a tent set up in his bedroom. A skunk bedded down in the kitchen sink. "It kept the rodents out, so we let it stay," he said.
Mr. Keating spent his childhood in Oceanside, Calif., a small Southern California beach town. He played baseball for Vanguard University, earning a bachelor's degree in business administration and a master's in organizational psychology. He then pursued a career in modeling and acting. He appeared in a commercial for Mountain Dew and was cast in the reality dating show "FBoy Island" in 2021. He was booted off in the fourth week.
By late 2021, he was delivering refrigerators to college dorm rooms and dreaming of a different life. "I wanted to surf with cool people, have a family and find meaningful work," he said. He packed his 1985 Nissan truck with donated baseball equipment and set off for Costa Rica. During the five-week road trip, he gave the baseball gear to children in Nicaragua.
After their first meeting, Mr. Keating suggested that he and Ms. Baroni attend a local festival where, in an effort to impress Ms. Baroni, he jumped into a rodeo arena with angry bulls. To his surprise, Ms. Baroni followed. Both escaped unscathed, and with a surge of adrenaline, shared a first kiss.
Soon after, Ms. Baroni texted a friend in Italy: "I've met my future husband and the father of my children."

Mr. Keating was similarly smitten. The couple began surfing together, and Ms. Baroni's fearlessness in the face of huge waves fueled Mr. Keating's ardor and admiration.
Several months later, after moving in together, Ms. Baroni floated the first "I love you." Mr. Keating began to sob. "After years of wandering and not finding, here was everything I wanted," he said.
In 2023, the couple traveled together to more than a dozen countries and visited each other's families. They also developed careers. Ms. Baroni now works as an independent model, photographer and content creator. Mr. Keating, who still occasionally models and acts in commercials, is the chief marketing officer at Primal, a social media company. "When you have the right person at your side, it's easy to find yourself," Ms. Baroni said.
In June 2023, the couple, still living a nomadic life, were invited by one of Mr. Keating's work associates to cruise the Greek islands on his boat. On the island of Paxos, atop a rocky hillside, Mr. Keating dropped to a knee and, with friends and colleagues watching, proposed with a snake-shaped ring with tiny diamond eyes that reminded him of the jungles of Costa Rica. Ms. Baroni closed her eyes and fell silent. For several minutes, Mr. Keating wondered if he was experiencing the most embarrassing moment of his life.
"Just two nights before, I had dreamed we were marrying," Ms. Baroni explained. When her eyes opened she smiled and said yes. The two clasped hands and leaped into the sea.
On Oct. 10, at San Clemente State Beach park in San Clemente, Calif., the couple were married by Jon Chenot, a friend of Mr. Keating's who was ordained by American Marriage Ministries for the event.
Ms. Baroni said her vows in Italian. "I spoke love with my heart, I know Paul understood," she said. After the ceremony, the 100 guests walked a short dirt path to the beach, where the groom and his best man jumped into the Pacific for a sunset surf session while still wearing their wedding attire.
"We are going to have the most interesting lives," Ms. Baroni said.

Premier League's Fight With City Won't End Well for Anyone: [Sports Desk]

Full text: A decision about rules that left both sides claiming victory revealed the broken reality of the world's richest competition.
One, single, lonely thing has become abundantly clear to English soccer after a week filled with jarring acronyms and dense legalese and furious, desperate spin: Manchester City's ongoing courtroom struggle against the Premier League is not going to conclude with either side winning. At the end of all this, everyone involved is going to lose.
To recap: On Monday, an independent tribunal handed down its verdict on City's attempt to challenge the legitimacy of the Premier League's rules on so-called Associated Party Transactions. Those are sponsorship deals struck by clubs with other companies linked to their owners.
Quite what that verdict was might best be considered a "choose your own adventure" sort of situation. City claimed that the judges had decided that the rules were unlawful, and therefore celebrated what it saw as a decisive victory. The Premier League claimed that, while the panel had identified a couple of minor, procedural discrepancies, the system had largely been upheld.
Manchester City was so incensed by that reading of the decision that its lawyers -- who, by this stage, probably need a few days off -- immediately sent a letter to the league's 19 other clubs, dismissing the league's conclusion, stating that the sponsorship rules had been thrown out, and suggesting its rivals should now direct all further communication to them.
The reaction to that was, well, what you might expect. Executives are now openly wondering whether the democratic approach that has helped fuel the league's growth is sustainable. There are dark whispers of City's rivals' submitting warnings of further legal action in advance of a conclusion to the club's unrelated and more significant case against the league.
It is worth pausing at this point to stress, precisely, exactly what has brought us here. That has, to some extent, been lost over the last week, buried some way beneath the baroque legal complexities and the purposefully mangled language and the deafening roar of claim and counterclaim.
On the surface, it would appear that Manchester City would quite like it if the Premier League did not have any rules governing whether teams can sign hugely inflated deals with other entities that are either controlled by, or connected to, their owners. If some other company should want to pay over the odds for a sleeve sponsorship or to be an official poultry farming partner, then that should be fine.
In much of the coverage of the case, this argument has been treated as though it is not -- on some fundamental level -- completely absurd. Why would another company want to pay a hugely inflated price for a sponsorship deal? What is in it for them to strike a deal that is not, to use the correct term, vaguely related to "fair market value"?
What reason could there be for someone agreeing to such a deal, other than an owner attempting to funnel money into a club by the back door, thus immediately negating any and all financial rules the Premier League might like to have?
The response to this, of course, is that the rules exist to protect what some City supporters have derided as an elite "cartel" of clubs set on maintaining power at the expense of competition. Nobody ever really bothers to ask what the alternative precedent might be, but just to be clear: The answer is not a great party of liberation, now that the oppressive regime of, um, Tottenham Hotspur has been abolished.
No, it is -- best-case scenario -- a duopoly, in which Manchester City and Newcastle United have so much more money at their disposal than everyone else that their rivals must choose between risking bankruptcy and risking irrelevance.
The old elite of English soccer are, obviously, horribly self-interested, but no more so than its unlikely revolutionaries. To pretend otherwise falls somewhere on the spectrum from naiveté to sophistry. (This is beside the point, but it is probably easier for West Ham, say, to catch a Manchester United trying to save money than a Manchester City determined to spend it.)
If this subject seems like a strange hill on which the most successful soccer league in the world -- and the team that has dominated its last decade -- should choose to self-immolate, it is probably because it is. But then, like all the best arguments, this one is really about something else.
It is possible, of course, that Manchester City took up the cudgels against the Premier League on the issue of related-party sponsorships because the club truly believes those rules are unjust. (Nobody has really explained how.) It is certainly feasible that it did so because it knows abolishing them is in its own interests.
But far more likely, on reflection, it decided to pick this fight as both a pathfinder and a warning shot. Reading the verdict, it is quite hard to understand why City was so quick to claim such a unanimous victory. The club has landed several significant blows, to be sure, but many of its challenges were summarily dismissed by the judges.
The overall picture, though, is more important than the detail. City succeeded in picking holes, however minor they may seem, in some of the Premier League's rules. That matters, because the case that will decide its future -- the one examining the 115 charges of breaching financial rules, the charges it stridently denies -- most likely will be determined less by right or wrong, by fact or fiction, and more by procedural shortcomings and legal technicalities.
City's lawyers, now, have proof of concept. They know the Premier League's rules are not watertight. The club can be sure, too, that the perception of reality is just as important as reality itself. The actual outcome of a legal case matters substantially less than who is successful in claiming to have won it.
In that sense, the fire and the fury of the last five days are not a distraction but rather the point: a hint of what will happen if whatever verdict is handed down in the more meaningful case is not to City's exact liking. It is a taste of what is to come, if necessary: competing narratives in the news media, open mutiny behind the scenes, and the lingering threat that City is perfectly happy to take the whole edifice down if necessary.
This, then, is the reality that the Premier League faces, one in which the best-case scenario involves imposing a draconian punishment on the team that has become its standard-bearer, and then (in all but the most extreme circumstances) finding a way to reincorporate that same club while it is in a state of open revolt.
The alternative, somehow, is less appealing still, a world in which Manchester City is free to pump as much money into its team as it likes, but is still reliant for much of its prominence on a league that has ceased to work, where the idea of good faith is a ghost, and in which the risk of legal action from one club or another squats, brooding, on the horizon.
Those are the two choices. The coming months will bring one, or the other. There are no winners here.
Getting His Wings
The reaction to the announcement of Jürgen Klopp's new job -- global head of soccer for the Red Bull stable of teams -- was both entirely predictable and probably a little overblown. In Germany, in particular, his decision was treated as a betrayal: the man of the people selling his soul for a corporate dollar.
This is, of course, both a little late -- Klopp was not working for kindhearted socialists in his eight years as Liverpool manager -- and a touch unfair. In his homeland, Klopp might be indelibly associated with Borussia Dortmund, but that does not mean he has any obligation to share the mores of a specific but voluble section of the club's fans.
At the same time, though, he really has only himself to blame. As well as not always being unfailingly polite to referees, Klopp has always had a bit of a tendency to supply his detractors with plenty of petards with which he might later be hoist.
In 2016, for example, he said he had no desire to spend huge amounts of money on individual players. Two years later, he had spent the better part of $ 200 million on Virgil van Dijk and Alisson Becker. And, more relevantly, he once described himself as a soccer "traditionalist," someone who was not naturally sympathetic to the aims of Red Bull's sprawling, inherently commercial project.
Klopp is not the first person in soccer to find his principles more malleable than anticipated, and he will not be the last. Still, though, it is not hard to understand why those who treasure any ally they might find in the increasingly hopeless struggle to stop the sport from eating itself might have found this pill an especially bitter one to swallow.

The 'Noble' Moose Is an Island's Mascot, And a Menace to Drivers: [Correction]

Full text: Running into a moose when driving a car or truck is bad enough, but crashing into the giant animal while riding on two wheels can be worse.
Kevin Connors barely survived such an encounter while cruising on his motorbike just after sundown on a highway in Newfoundland, a Tennessee-size island in the North Atlantic.
"I was looking ahead of me into a gradual turn to the right, and the moose came up from the left, so I didn't really see it until it was very close," Mr. Connors recalled. The moose stopped in its tracks, "and I hit him dead on."
Mr. Connors doesn't clearly remember what happened next, but a friend traveling behind him "saw me and the moose tumbling down the road like in a cartoon."
The moose ran off. The motorbike shot off into the woods. And Mr. Connors said he was a "living bruise" for two weeks, with a broken wrists and most of the skin scraped off his back. Five years later, he is still receiving therapy for back pain.
Rather than a rarity, such motorist-moose accidents are a common occurrence in Newfoundland, their frequency reinforced by a large sign on a portion of the Trans-Canada Highway that runs past the forests, bogs and ponds of the island's Terra Nova National Park.
Under a drawing of a moose in a yellow warning triangle, the 7-by-12-foot sign displays the number of collisions between vehicles and moose, which can weigh half a ton or more and can do severe, even deadly, damage to anything that strikes them.
So far this year, there have been 13 such impacts on the highway, including one that killed a driver (the moose themselves rarely survive). But the island is just now entering a peak season for collisions, so that number is likely to rise. Last year, the rolling hills of the park recorded a total of 24 moose collisions.
That a moose-motorist accident happens, on average, every other week on one 27-mile stretch of highway is but one of the contemporary costs of a fateful decision made 120 years ago. That was when Newfoundland, which had no native moose, imported calves from New Brunswick to lure big game hunters as tourists, with only four surviving the ship ride.
The descendants of that quartet of calves now number 120,000 to 150,000, about one-fourth the size of Newfoundland's human population.
"They're an amazing animal," said Shawn J. Leroux, a professor of biology at Memorial University of Newfoundland. "If you have good food resources, females will have twins more often. So it doesn't take long for a population to grow if you don't have natural predators."
Wolves, the only true predator of moose, were essentially eliminated from the island about 90 years ago.
Across all roads on the island, part of the province of Labrador and Newfoundland, moose are involved in an annual average of 539 collisions with cars and trucks -- although many Newfoundlanders believe the daily rate of 1.5 accidents is an understatement because of unreported incidents.
The collisions lead to hundreds of cases of serious injuries and several human deaths annually. In one bid to reduce accidents, rush hour radio programs include moose sightings during traffic reports.
"I'm not sure there's anybody in the province who hasn't had a close call," said Andrew Furey, the premier of Newfoundland and Labrador. "It's always a concern for everybody."
The destruction wrought by the introduction of moose goes beyond the road.
Voracious eaters, moose put away about 50 pounds of food a day, and as they feast, they stunt tree growth and ravage vegetation, trampling what they don't consume and turning forests into meadows.
Terra Nova park officials estimate that moose have significantly degraded about 70 square miles of its forest.
But despite the highway menace and the forest devastation, Newfoundlanders have adopted the "noble animal," as it was called on its introduction, as a symbol of their rocky island, celebrating it in song and sculpture.
And a variation of the original motivation for introducing the moose remains: The annual moose hunt, which mostly involves locals, not gun-toting tourists, is a cultural event on the island.
Several factors make moose particularly dangerous for drivers and their passengers.
Despite their imposing dimensions, they can be difficult to spot. At night, moose eyes don't glow brightly when struck by headlights, and their fur is dark.
Then there's their center of gravity. In order to get around bogs and marshes, the bulky torsos and antler-equipped heads of moose sit atop long, spindly legs, and their top-heavy bodies are a disaster for cars and light trucks. After their legs are knocked out from beneath them, moose usually land on vehicles' roofs, sometimes crushing the passengers underneath.
Amid the rows of steel racks holding vehicles at a scrapyard in St. John's, the provincial capital, the demolished fronts, missing or destroyed windshields and collapsed roofs of the victims of moose collisions stand out.
"That's a moose hit right there," Paul Fry, the manager, said in front of the ruins of a late-model Nissan Rogue. "It's like nothing else. The high legs, they get hit and then they tumble in from all the way up there. It's sad stuff."
And while the car-moose interactions are generally unintentional on both sides, that's not always the case. Bull moose during mating season can be dangerous and aggressive, and passing cars are sometimes an outlet for that aggression.
"I think they're the most dangerous animal in the forest," said Professor Leroux, who also knows the animals as one of the province's 27,500 moose-hunting license holders. "I do not want to see, if I'm not hunting, bull moose in the fall because they're aggressive. They can be very aggressive, it's quite shocking."
Dr. Furey, the premier, continues to practice part time as an orthopedic surgeon. Through that work, he often sees the results of moose collisions on the road.
"One is too many with the fatalities," he said. "But often not seen in the numbers are the consequences of a nonfatal motor vehicle collision with a moose and the impact that has on patients' lives: arthritis, chronic pain, post-traumatic stress."
Motorists have different moose strategies, the most common one being simply not driving at night or at least avoiding the time around dusk and dawn, when accidents are most common. And the front of most heavy trucks are equipped with battering-ram-style tubular steel guards.
Harold Pelley is a taxidermist in Glenwood, Newfoundland, whose creations often include moose. Before retirement, his job with the provincial government involved shooting moose seriously injured by vehicles and removing moose carcasses found along highway.
The moose bumpers on heavy trucks, he said, generally leave the vehicles unscathed after moose encounters, so their drivers, Mr. Pelley said, continue on without reporting the incident, lowering the overall crash statistics.
The province has tested several accident-reduction ideas: clearing back more trees and brush from beside the highway (except that can actually encourage moose to come out to the road to browse), fencing (a costly maintenance headache) and electronic moose detectors that trigger roadside warning lights (disappointingly unreliable).
So even motorists who take all reasonable precautions might not be able to avoid an encounter. "I was doing everything right," said Mr. Connors, the motorbike rider, "until the moose popped out in front of me."
Professor Leroux said the only government projects that have been successful, at least at reducing the number of moose, have been giving out extra permits for hunting near highways and allowing hunting in the island's two national parks.
That said, Professor Leroux doesn't favor removing Newfoundland's moose -- even if it were possible.
"It's not native, but it's naturalized," he said sitting next to an enormous moose skull. "It's a huge part of the culture here."
He would like to see wolves re-established to help balance out the population, adding that it would have to be done carefully to avoid harming the island's already diminished caribou herds.
More than a century after their arrival, the idea of eliminating the island's moose is unthinkable to Newfoundlanders.
"For the most part, people would not want to lose the moose for whatever reason," said Allan Brown, whose tow truck company in Gander deals with about 20 moose collisions a year. "I suspect that they got squatters' rights."

The province has tested several accident-reduction ideas: clearing more trees and brush from beside the highway (except that can actually encourage moose to come out to the road to browse), fencing (a costly maintenance headache) and electronic moose detectors that trigger roadside warning lights (disappointingly unreliable).
So even motorists who take all reasonable precautions might not be able to avoid an encounter. “I was doing everything right,” said Connors, the motorbike rider, “until the moose popped out in front of me.”
Leroux said the only government projects that have been successful, at least at reducing the number of moose, have been giving out extra permits for hunting near highways and allowing hunting in the island’s two national parks.
That said, Leroux doesn’t favor removing Newfoundland’s moose — even if it were possible.
“It’s not native, but it’s naturalized,” he said sitting next to an enormous moose skull. “It’s a huge part of the culture here.”
He would like to see wolves reestablished to help balance out the population, adding that it would have to be done carefully to avoid harming the island’s diminished caribou herds.
More than a century after their arrival, the idea of eliminating the island’s moose is unthinkable to Newfoundlanders.
“For the most part, people would not want to lose the moose for whatever reason,” said Allan Brown, whose tow truck company in Gander deals with about 20 moose collisions a year. “I suspect that they got squatters’ rights.”

At Stellantis, The Troubles Are Piling Up: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The automaker, created by a 2021 merger, is dealing with labor unrest, slumping sales and a revolt from its dealers.
Stellantis, an automotive colossus that owns more than a dozen brands including Chrysler, Fiat, Jeep, Peugeot and Ram, is facing challenges at seemingly every turn.
The company's sales and profit have been plummeting. Dealers stuck with parking lots filled with unsold cars are publicly criticizing Stellantis and its chief executive in unusually harsh terms. Stellantis's stock price has fallen almost 50 percent from its high point in March. And the union that represents its U.S. factory workers is threatening to go on strike at several plants.
United Automobile Workers locals are expected to vote in the coming days to authorize strikes against several Stellantis factories, protesting what they say are broken promises by the automaker.
The problems are raising questions about the future of Carlos Tavares, the Stellantis chief executive, who races cars in his spare time. After taking the reins at the French carmaker PSA in 2014, he acquired a series of rivals to build a company that last year sold more cars than General Motors did.
Last week, Stellantis said it was evaluating who should lead the company when Mr. Tavares's contract expires in early 2026. Mr. Tavares could remain chief executive, Stellantis said, but the statement was hardly a vote of confidence.
In 2021, PSA merged with Fiat Chrysler, and the combined company adopted the name Stellantis. While the company is based in Amsterdam, its U.S. operations accounted for more than half of Stellantis's profit in the first six months of 2024, meaning that problems here reverberate across the Atlantic. And the problems are deep, analyst say.
"I wouldn't want to be Carlos Tavares," said Erin Keating, the senior director of economic and industry insights at Cox Automotive, a market research firm.
Jeep and other Stellantis brands raised prices more than other automakers did in recent years, Ms. Keating said, and waited longer to offer discounts when demand slowed. High interest rates made those prices even more unpalatable to car buyers. As a result, many people who are ready to trade in Jeep Wagoneers or Dodge Chargers that they bought three or four years ago can't afford the latest models.
Dodge dealers have, on average, 149 days of supply on lots, including many 2023 models, according to Cox. That is almost twice the industry average. Market share of Stellantis brands in the United States had fallen to 8.6 percent as of the end of June from 10.4 percent a year earlier, Cox said.
Dealers are furious. Kevin Farrish, the chairman of the Stellantis National Dealer Council, which represents the company's independent car dealers, blamed decisions that favored short-term profits and helped Mr. Tavares qualify for a 50 percent pay raise last year, earning nearly $ 40 million.
"The reckless short-term decision-making to secure record profits in 2023 has had devastating, yet entirely predictable, consequences in the U.S. market," Mr. Farrish and other members of the council wrote in a letter to Mr. Tavares this month. "Those consequences include the rapid degradation of our iconic American brands."
"You created this problem," the dealers wrote in an unusually direct rebuke.
Stellantis declined to make Mr. Tavares available for an interview. In a statement, the company said his compensation was in line with other automotive chief executives', taking into account corporate profits.
The president of the U.A.W., Shawn Fain, has been just as strident in his criticism of Mr. Tavares, accusing him of backpedaling on promises to revive operations at a shuttered factory in Belvidere, Ill., and of planning to move production of the Dodge Durango, a large sport utility vehicle, from Detroit to Canada.
"Either we allow an out-of-control C.E.O. and his billionaire backers who have enjoyed years of record profits to close plant after plant and continue destroying our country," Mr. Fain told union members last week, "or we stand up."
The confrontation between Stellantis and the U.A.W. comes a year after strikes helped workers win record pay raises. As part of the contract that ended those strikes, workers won the right to walk out if the company didn't meet its commitments -- a right that the union is now threatening to invoke.
The company denied that it was violating any commitments to the U.A.W., and said it had not confirmed plans to move Durango production.
"Stellantis has abided, and will continue to abide, by the agreement the parties reached in 2023," Carlos Zarlenga, the chief operating officer of Stellantis North America, said in an email to Mr. Fain on Monday.
The problems at Stellantis raise doubts about the series of acquisitions during the last decade that made it the fourth-largest carmaker after Toyota, Volkswagen and Hyundai-Kia. (Stellantis is fifth if the alliance of Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi is considered one company.)
The deal-making led by Mr. Tavares was supposed to allow the company's car brands to share the costs of developing new technology and save money by using common components. The rationale was that bigger carmakers had a better chance of surviving the upheaval caused by the industry's shift to electric vehicles and autonomous driving.
Those benefits have not materialized as much as the company hoped, analysts said. The company disagreed, saying in a statement that combining the automakers had saved $ 8 billion since 2019.
Stellantis offers a wide selection of midsize and small cars in Europe. In the United States, however, Jeep's model lineup is heavy on higher-priced, large sport utility vehicles after it discontinued the smaller Cherokee and Renegade models last year. That change came just as cost-conscious buyers began showing a preference for smaller S.U.V.s like the Toyota RAV4, Chevrolet Trax and Honda CR-V.
And Stellantis has been unable to arrest the decline of Chrysler, which began decades ago and was once a formidable rival to Chevrolet and Ford Motor. Chrysler's lineup has dwindled to one vehicle -- the Pacifica minivan, which is available as a plug-in hybrid or with a conventional gasoline engine. (Chrysler is still selling off remaining inventory of the 300 sedan, which it stopped producing last year.)
Stellantis said it was taking steps to regain market share, including cutting the starting price of its least expensive model, the Jeep Compass, to below $ 30,000. The company said this week that it would revive the Chrysler Voyager minivan with a starting price of $ 40,000, slightly less than the least expensive Pacifica. The new Voyager will go on sale at the end of this year.
Bigger discounts for models like the Ram 1500 Classic pickup helped Stellantis sales in the United States and Canada surge 20 percent in August, the company said.
Still, with so many unsold vehicles, Stellantis faces pressure to throttle production and cut jobs, "which is obviously upsetting to the U.A.W.," said Kevin Roberts, director of industry analytics and insights at CarGurus, a car shopping website.
Dealers complain that the company does not have a clear strategy.
"Our businesses are suffering. Our employees are suffering," said Sean Hogan, the vice president of Sierra Auto Group, which owns Stellantis dealerships in Los Angeles. "We're not seeing a plan to bring us back to a volume we once had."
Mr. Hogan, also the secretary of the company's dealer council, said he met with top Stellantis executives on Monday but was not satisfied by what he heard. The automaker is still not offering incentives that are generous enough to increase sales and allow dealers to make a decent profit, he said in an email.
Mr. Fain, the U.A.W. president, told members that at least one union local would hold a strike authorization vote soon. Under the terms of the contract with Stellantis, the union would be obligated to meet at least seven times with management to try to resolve its grievances. A strike would happen only if the talks were unsuccessful.
In the short term, factory shutdowns by striking workers may be a blessing in disguise for Stellantis, buying time to clear dealer lots of unsold vehicles. But the company would also risk damaging its brands by alienating car buyers who are sympathetic to union demands.
"Labor unrest is never good," Ms. Keating of Cox Automotive said.

Full text: Ethan Bregman asked Olha Beskhmelnytsina to be his girlfriend on Feb. 23, 2022. The next day, the world had changed.
After a romantic getaway in Venice in late February 2022, Olha Beskhmelnytsina and Ethan Bregman said their goodbyes and flew home -- she to Kyiv, Ukraine, and he to New York City.
The weekend was technically their first date, and after processing his feelings, on Feb. 23, Mr. Bregman texted Ms. Beskhmelnytsina that he cared a lot about her and asked if she wanted to take their budding relationship seriously. Ms. Beskhmelnytsina, a film producer and director, had come home from a movie premiere exhausted that evening and decided to answer him the next morning.
The next day, she woke to the sound of bombs; Russia had launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
"I receive this message as my world is turning upside down," Ms. Beskhmelnytsina said. Still, with all the chaos around her, one thing was clear. "I really want to date him," she said.
After weighing her options, Ms. Beskhmelnytsina decided to remain in Kyiv to work as a fixer for two photographers, Ron Haviv of The Economist, and Heidi Levine of The Washington Post. (A fixer, or field producer, translates and explains local customs or policies, communicates with local authorities and arranges interviews and logistics for journalists.)
In tandem with that role, she began documenting what she was witnessing in the war zones for a film -- the final product, "Overcoming the Darkness," premiered in June 2022 -- and after having hesitated for years, founded a film-production company, 2Brave Productions, with her friend Natalia Libet.
Having to tell Mr. Bregman that she wouldn't evacuate and would be working in the most dangerous parts of the country, Ms. Beskhmelnytsina said, was "the hardest part of our relationship." But, she added, "he respected my decision, and for me it was such a key moment that he knew I won't change my mind and he supported me."
On the other side of the Atlantic, Mr. Bregman was deeply worried, but wanted Ms. Beskhmelnytsina to do what she thought was right. Still, he said, "I would wake up every morning and check when was the last time she was online."
This was how he knew she was still alive, even if she hadn't had a chance to message him.
Ms. Beskhmelnytsina, 38, spent her entire life in Kyiv and has produced more than 30 films and television series. She has a bachelor's and a master's degree in international economics from the Ukrainian State University of Finance and International Trade, and a second master's degree in film directing from the Kyiv National University of Culture and Arts.
Since 2023, she has been the chairwoman of the Ukrainian Film Academy. One of the recent projects she co-produced is "Intercepted," a documentary that premiered at the Berlinale International Film Festival in February and interweaves recordings of Russian soldiers speaking on the phone with scenes of life and destruction in Ukraine.
Mr. Bregman, 44, an engine designer for professional motor sport, was born and raised in New York City. He has a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Yale, and two master's degrees, one in electrical engineering from Princeton and one in real estate development from the NYU School of Professional Studies.
At 6, he told his parents he wanted to build cars, and in college, he began working in the industry. He founded an engineering firm, Ayton Performance, in 2004, and since then, cars Ayton has worked on have won at the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans and Rolex 24 at Daytona races, among others.
Ms. Beskhmelnytsina and Mr. Bregman first met in October 2019 at the wedding of a mutual friend, Alina Rudya. At the time, both were in relationships, but that changed by October 2021, when Ms. Rudya invited them to the Spanish island of Majorca to celebrate her and her husband's second wedding anniversary.
It took Mr. Bregman four days to gather the courage to try to get Ms. Beskhmelnytsina alone.
"My big move was when we were at the marina, I said, 'Hey, I left my sunscreen at the house, do you want to come with me to the pharmacy to get some?"' Mr. Bregman said. She said yes.
Later that day, when they were at a cafe with their friends, the captain of the boat the group had chartered told them they looked like they were in love and would be married in a few years.
"We had our first kiss that night," Mr. Bregman said.
Though they were hesitant to engage in a long-distance relationship, the two stayed in touch over Telegram.
"At that point, I was single in my 40s and feeling kind of down on myself, and to find someone who's cool, but also amazing, talented, thoughtful, successful, and a kind human who was interested in me helped me realize that life wasn't over," Mr. Bregman said.

During the first year of the war, Mr. Bregman supported Ms. Beskhmelnytsina mostly from afar, meeting her in other countries like Poland when she had free time.
"I didn't want him to come during the first year," Ms. Beskhmelnytsina said. "I was worried about his parents." She didn't want them to fret over his safety if he were to travel to Ukraine.
In October 2022, both of them had a period of intensive travel, in the middle of which Mr. Bregman's mother, Arlene Slavin, turned 80.
"We could go home and rest, or rent a very small car and travel around Portugal with my parents," Mr. Bregman recalled saying to Ms. Beskhmelnytsina. "Olha said, 'Let's do it!' We had an amazing trip."
By the end, Mr. Bregman knew he wanted to marry Ms. Beskhmelnytsina. "You get my family, you get me, you integrate so well," he said.
For Ms. Beskhmelnytsina's 37th birthday in December 2022, he asked Mr. Haviv, who was on assignment in Kharkiv with her, to deliver a birthday present: a cashmere sweater to keep her warm when the power and heat were shut off, and her favorite Haribo gummies.
"It was completely dark in Kharkiv at the time, there was shelling, and that morning, Ron knocked on my door with a present from Ethan," Ms. Beskhmelnytsina said. "It was so sweet."
Two and a half months later, on Feb. 26, 2023, during a vacation in Italy with friends, Mr. Bregman gathered everyone at the lounge bar at the Hilton Lake Como.
He gave a speech where he thanked their friends for the support they had given Ukraine during the war, then continued.
"Over the last year, Olha and I have been to 17 different countries," he said. Then he referenced a spreadsheet he'd created for fun and eventually to track government-mandated time limits on their visits to the United States, Europe and Ukraine.
"I looked at it and I realized there's no one I'd rather go to the remaining countries with than you," he said to Ms. Beskhmelnytsina before bending to one knee and proposing with a platinum ring he had made by hand.
As everyone toasted with champagne, Ms. Beskhmelnytsina's best friend, Zoya Lytvyn, whom Mr. Bregman had secretly invited to Como, Italy, popped out of the crowd with a bouquet of sunflowers.
A few months later, in May 2023, Mr. Bregman visited Ukraine for the first time. Now, he and Ms. Beskhmelnytsina split their time equally between Kyiv and New York (a fact that he's confirmed with his spreadsheet).
The couple were legally married Sept. 7 by Yulia Logai, the director of civil service acts in the Lviv region of Ukraine. Their wedding ceremony on Sept. 14 at the Edem Resort spa in Strilky was led by their friend, Oksana Nechyporenko. Sixty-five guests attended, with about half arriving from outside the country.
The resort is in one of the safer regions of Ukraine, and was also the first place Mr. Bregman visited with Ms. Beskhmelnytsina on his initial trip to Ukraine.
"If we choose to have a wedding in Ukraine, my friends and family can choose to come or not, and if we have a wedding outside of Ukraine, many of her family don't have the choice," Mr. Bregman said. "For me it was obvious to give the choice rather than to take it away."
On the first evening of their celebrations, Mr. Bregman and Ms. Beskhmelnytsina hosted a welcome dinner with traditional Ukrainian dishes like borscht soup and vareniki, a type of dumpling; drinks like horseradish-infused vodka; and folk music. The ceremony was held the next day on a covered terrace and was followed by a cocktail hour in the resort's palais and a reception in the resort's grand hall.
Mr. Bregman wore a custom tuxedo by Alan David with a painting by his mother, an accomplished artist, printed on the inner silk lining of the jacket and the waistcoat. Ms. Beskhmelnytsina wore one dress by Pronovias for the ceremony and a second one custom-made by her friend Oksana Ostrovskaya, of the brand Sana, for the reception.
A surprise came a few days earlier when Ms. Beskhmelnytsina learned her cousin, Eugene Kolomyets, a Ukrainian soldier who was injured fighting on the front lines, would arrive from the hospital "just in time to make the wedding," Mr. Bregman said.
At the ceremony, "he wheeled himself right into the dance floor to join us."
The party continued into the wee hours.

Nods to the USA Ms. Beskhmelnytsina grew up watching American films and wanted to incorporate some of the traditions she had seen into the wedding, including not allowing Mr. Bregman to see her in her dress before the ceremony, serving mini burgers at midnight and having a "getaway car" from which she tossed a bouquet to her friends.
"When we asked about a getaway car, they suggested all these luxury cars," Mr. Bregman said. "But we're trying to keep it cozy and friendly, and not showy." Eventually, they decided on a 1991 burgundy Nissan Figaro.

"Our family logo is the moose," Mr. Bregman said. He even has a tattoo of a moose on his leg (as well as a tattoo of one of his mother's paintings).

"Many of Ethan's friends and my friends can't be at the wedding, so the photo and video I'll send to them, I wanted it to be as natural as possible," Ms. Beskhmelnytsina said.

Suspect Wrote Note on Plan To Kill Trump, Prosecutors Say: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Prosecutors disclosed new information in a memo written to persuade a federal judge to detain the suspect indefinitely while he awaits trial.
The federal government will pursue a charge of attempted assassination against a man accused of lurking with a gun near where former President Donald J. Trump was golfing in Florida last week, prosecutors said in a court hearing on Monday. Among the government's evidence, they said, was a note the suspect had written suggesting that he had planned the attack.
Such a charge -- which prosecutors said they would seek through a grand jury indictment -- would carry a maximum possible penalty of life imprisonment.
United States Magistrate Judge Ryon M. McCabe, of the Federal District Court in West Palm Beach, Fla., granted the government's request on Monday to keep the suspect, Ryan W. Routh, in jail without bond. So far, Mr. Routh has been charged with unlawful possession of a firearm as a felon, which carries a penalty of up to 15 years in prison, and with possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number.
Mr. Routh's defense lawyers had argued that their client was not a flight risk and did not pose a serious threat to the community, but Judge McCabe disagreed.
In a statement released by his campaign on Monday, Mr. Trump accused the Justice Department and the F.B.I. of "mishandling and downplaying the second assassination attempt on my life since July." He called the charges against Mr. Routh "a slap on the wrist" and said, "Let Florida handle the case!"
Last week, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, a Republican, said the state would conduct its own investigation into what happened, characterizing the federal inquiry as insufficiently transparent and perhaps biased against Mr. Trump.
At the court hearing on Monday, which lasted nearly three hours, Mark D. Dispoto, an assistant United States attorney, argued that Mr. Routh had ensconced himself in "nothing short of a sniper's nest" to target the former president, while Mr. Routh's federal public defenders extensively questioned the strength of the government's evidence.
Kristy Militello, one of his two lawyers, said that Mr. Routh's actions were the "unsophisticated and sort of untrained" work of a man whose writings suggested that he intended the assassination attempt to fail.
Mr. Routh, wearing a dark jail uniform with his blond hair combed back, appeared to closely follow the proceedings, especially when Renee Michelle Sihvola, his other lawyer, cross-examined Christian Hull, an F.B.I. special agent, about the government's evidence.
According to prosecutors, Mr. Routh, 58, appeared to have surveyed the grounds of the Trump International Golf Club for about a month before his arrest. On Sept. 15, Mr. Routh positioned himself outside the fence near the sixth hole of the course, where at about 1:30 p.m., a Secret Service agent on a golf cart who was scouting one hole ahead of the former president saw part of Mr. Routh's face and the barrel of his gun.
At the time he was spotted, prosecutors said, Mr. Routh was aligned directly with the sixth hole, with the intention of shooting Mr. Trump from a relatively short distance using a semiautomatic rifle. The rifle, equipped with a scope, was found abandoned at the scene; it had a round in the chamber and a total of 11 rounds loaded. Investigators found Mr. Routh's fingerprint on duct tape affixing the scope to the weapon.
"This was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I failed you," Mr. Routh wrote in a note that was placed inside a box that he left at a friend's house in North Carolina, according to prosecutors.
"I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster," the note continued. "It is up to you to finish the job; and I will offer $ 150,000 to whomever can complete the job."
The friend contacted law enforcement officials and told them about the note three days after Mr. Routh's arrest.
In the note, prosecutors said, Mr. Routh also wrote that Mr. Trump was unfit to be president. Mr. Routh had left the note at the house several months before the shooting -- an indication, they said, that he had been planning the assassination for a long time.
Ms. Sihvola got Mr. Hull, the F.B.I. agent, to identify multiple references in the note to Mr. Routh's belief that his plan would likely fail; those references were in parts of the note that prosecutors had not included in their memo asking the judge to detain Mr. Routh indefinitely.
Mr. Hull also acknowledged under questioning by Ms. Sihvola that he was not aware of any footage from surveillance or other cameras showing Mr. Routh at the golf course or with the rifle.
Mr. Hull also disclosed that another handwritten note had been found perhaps 15 feet from the rifle. That note, he said, was addressed to The New York Times.
Mr. Dispoto called the second note "ancillary" and pointed out that it was not part of the government's filing. Mr. Routh was interviewed by The Times last year about his efforts to recruit foreign fighters to Ukraine.
The developments on Monday painted the clearest picture to date of an itinerant and impoverished building contractor, with no apparent ties to Florida, who repeatedly professed his willingness to die defending Ukraine.
Mr. Routh's lawyers portrayed their client as dedicated to the cause of democracy in Ukraine and Taiwan, and added that, even after his arrest, he has the support of his adult children and siblings. He lived with a partner in Hawaii for the past eight years and spent "the better half of the past decade," Ms. Militello said, "as a law-abiding citizen."
Prosecutors noted Mr. Routh's extensive criminal history, including a 2002 felony charge in North Carolina for possessing a weapon of mass death and destruction. Court documents described the weapon as a "binary explosive with a 10-inch detonation and a blasting cap." Mr. Routh was convicted and placed on supervised probation for 60 months.
Investigators who searched the black Nissan Xterra S.U.V. that Mr. Routh was driving on Sept. 15, found "a handwritten list of dates in August, September and October 2024 and venues where the former president had appeared or was expected to be present," according to the prosecutors' memo.
Agents also found six cellphones -- including one that contained a Google search of how to travel from Palm Beach County to Mexico -- as well as 12 pairs of gloves, a Hawaii driver's license in Mr. Routh's name and a passport.
Judge McCabe cited the Google search and Mr. Routh's passport as evidence of his potential flight risk, and his criminal record, his apparent staking out of the golf course and the seriousness of the existing firearms charges against him as evidence of his potential danger to the community.
"The government has met its burden" to warrant detention, Judge McCabe said.

Ex-Officer Implicates Memphis Colleagues in Beating Death of Driver: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A former Memphis officer said he had been angry about a lack of arrests even before he began a pursuit that led to a fatal beating.
Emmitt Martin III was already angry on Jan. 7, 2023, his nerves simmering in his first days back on patrol in Memphis after being sidelined for months by a car accident. As a member of a street crime unit, he said, he felt the need to prove he was still a capable officer, and he had yet to make an arrest that night.
Then he saw a blue Nissan speed up to beat a red light.
On Tuesday, Mr. Martin told a jury that he had not only pursued that driver, Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, but that he had also punched and kicked him, and then lied about what happened. He identified the other officers there that night: all men with whom he had an unspoken understanding to never disclose the use of unwarranted force.
"I knew they weren't going to tell on me," Mr. Martin said. "And I wasn't going to tell on them."
Mr. Martin has since pleaded guilty to two charges in connection with Mr. Nichols's beating and death three days later. On trial are three of his former Memphis police colleagues -- Demetrius Haley, Tadarrius Bean and Justin Smith -- who are accused of depriving Mr. Nichols of his civil rights and lying about what happened.
Mr. Martin's testimony has pierced the officers' code of silence and stripped the case to its core: whether a jury will believe that the violence and lies amounted to a federal crime.
"These are criminal defendants, they just happen to be police officers," said Kami N. Chavis, a law professor at the College of William & Mary and director of the school's criminal justice program.
Another officer, Desmond Mills Jr., also pleaded guilty and was expected to testify against his former colleagues.
"The fact that they are testifying against their fellow officers says nothing about the code of silence," Ms. Chavis added. "It says the code of silence is so strong it took a criminal proceeding in order for these officers to finally tell the truth."
Asked directly by a prosecutor about his plea agreement, Mr. Martin acknowledged a hope that his honesty would factor into a lighter prison sentence. But he framed his testimony as a resolve to "just get this off of me."
"I can't sit here and live with a lie -- the truth needs to come out," he said. "It was eating me up inside to live with a lie."
John Keith Perry Jr., the first defense lawyer to cross-examine Mr. Martin, sought to emphasize how his client, Mr. Bean, had been unaware of Mr. Martin's anger. He also probed the accuracy of Mr. Martin's recollection, particularly since Mr. Martin's story had shifted over a series of interviews.
"I know what you saw downstairs," Mr. Perry said at one point, an apparent reference to Mr. Martin's meetings with prosecutors, who have an office a floor below the courtroom. "I'm talking about what you saw on the scene."
All five men were members of the same team of the street crime team, known as the Scorpion unit. In the days after Mr. Nichols's death last January, the five men, all of whom are Black, were quickly fired and later charged with state and federal charges. A state trial for all five men on second-degree murders charges is still pending.
Mr. Martin had been set to stand trial in the federal case as recently as August when he abruptly pleaded guilty, with prosecutors recommending up to 40 years in prison. (Mr. Mills had pleaded guilty months earlier, with a recommended 15-year sentence.)
When Mr. Martin first took the stand on Monday, Mr. Smith, Mr. Haley and Mr. Bean each stood to meet Mr. Martin's eyes and let him identify them. For most of his time on the stand, however, Mr. Martin did not look at the defendants, his eyes at times darting toward the jury or down at his fidgeting hands. He answered the questions in a low baritone, often asking the prosecutor to repeat or paraphrase an inquiry.
The five men had all been connected: Mr. Martin had graduated from the police academy with Mr. Smith, and had already known Mr. Mills through a fraternity. He met Mr. Bean as a member of the team, and he and Mr. Haley, he told the jury, were known as the "Smash Brothers."
The Scorpion unit was a "stat-driven" team, where the number of arrests and amount of contraband confiscated mattered. When Mr. Martin returned to work on Jan. 3, 2023, after months of desk duty because he was hit by a car driven by a person fleeing the police during a high-speed chase, he was "seeing red," he said at one point.
"I needed an arrest to show that I'm capable of doing what I'm doing," Mr. Martin later told the jury.
Pressed further by Stephen R. Leffler, a lawyer for Mr. Haley, Mr. Martin said that post-traumatic stress disorder from the collision had left him at times sleep-deprived, paranoid and irritable. And he said that if he didn't "get his stats," he might be removed from the unit and sent back to his home precinct, an "embarrassing" prospect.
Mr. Martin was driving alone when he saw Mr. Nichols speed up to beat a red light, though he acknowledged having no way of knowing how fast Mr. Nichols was driving. As he followed, he said, Mr. Nichols started changing lanes without using a turn signal, a minor traffic violation, and he pursued him.
When Mr. Martin ran Mr. Nichols's plates, there was no record or indication of issue. Mr. Martin called over the radio to his team, he said, which led Mr. Haley to the area.
Mr. Haley and Mr. Martin boxed in Mr. Nichols's car, and Mr. Haley yanked Mr. Nichols from his vehicle. The officers issued a barrage of expletive-laden commands for Mr. Nichols to get on the ground.
Kathryn E. Gilbert, a prosecutor, asked Mr. Martin if he ever explained to Mr. Nichols why he had been stopped. "Never got a chance to, or just didn't?" she asked.
"Just didn't," Mr. Martin said.
When Mr. Haley used pepper spray, Mr. Martin said, he accidentally sprayed some of the officers present, allowing Mr. Nichols to break free.
Mr. Martin -- who once earned the nickname "Full Can" after unloading an entire can of pepper spray on a man resisting arrest -- grew angrier, he said. And there was an unsanctioned policy about what happened if someone ran from an officer: "You get your ass beat."
"That was the tip of the iceberg," he later explained. "I was already angry, on top of that I got sprayed."
He said that he had been unaware that a street camera had been recording the officers when they caught up with Mr. Nichols. At one point, Mr. Martin removed his body camera and later gestured for Mr. Mills to do the same, after the violence ended.
"I didn't want to show what we were doing," Mr. Martin said, when asked to explain his decision to leave his camera behind. "We were assaulting Mr. Nichols."
Ms. Gilbert repeatedly played clips of street camera and body camera footage that captured the moment when officers caught up to Mr. Nichols, stopping them sometimes after just a few seconds to press Mr. Martin on whom he recognized and what they were doing.
She also asked whether Mr. Nichols was a threat.
"He wasn't a threat," Mr. Martin repeatedly said. At one point, after watching himself punch and kick Mr. Nichols, he added, "He was helpless."

Suspect Fired No Shots but Hid by Trump's Golf Course for 12 Hours: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ryan W. Routh was charged with two federal gun crimes a day after Secret Service agents fired on him as he pointed a rifle toward the golf course where former President Donald Trump was playing.
The man arrested after pointing a rifle through a fence ringing former President Donald J. Trump's golf course in Florida on Sunday never got off a shot, but appears to have remained undetected for nearly 12 hours before being spotted by a Secret Service agent who drove him off with a volley of gunfire, officials said on Monday.
The man, Ryan W. Routh, 58, a building contractor with an extensive criminal history, never had the former president in his line of sight but was able to hide in the bushes just outside the fence on the edge of the course until Mr. Trump was only hundreds of yards away.
Mr. Routh did not fire at "our agents" before they fired at him, Ronald Rowe Jr., the acting Secret Service director, said at a news conference in West Palm Beach, Fla.
Mr. Routh wore a blue inmate jumpsuit at his initial appearance in a federal courtroom in Florida on Monday. He faces two felony gun charges that allow the authorities to keep him in custody while they continue their investigation into what the F.B.I. has called an assassination attempt.
The F.B.I.'s top agent in Miami, Jeffrey B. Veltri, speaking to reporters, said the bureau had no information that the suspect was working with anybody else. Agents in Hawaii and North Carolina -- two states where the suspect lived -- had fanned out to conduct interviews as part of a broad investigation into his travels, how he had acquired the rifle and what his motivations had been.
Among the unanswered questions is how Mr. Routh knew Mr. Trump would be on the course. While Mr. Trump frequently plays golf at his properties, his Sunday outing was not a publicly announced appearance, unlike the rally in July in Butler, Pa., where a gunman got off multiple shots, leaving Mr. Trump slightly wounded, one rally attendee dead and two others wounded.
"It was an off-the-record movement, meaning it was not on the former president's official schedule," Mr. Rowe said.
Cellphone data retrieved by the F.B.I. indicated that Mr. Routh's phone was "in the vicinity of the area along the tree line" of the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach beginning at 1:59 a.m. on Sunday, according to a federal criminal complaint unsealed on Monday.
It remained there until 1:31 p.m., when a keen-eyed Secret Service agent walking one hole ahead of Mr. Trump spotted the barrel of a rifle and opened fire, the complaint said.
Mr. Routh, wearing a faded T-shirt, fled the scene, leaving behind a loaded SKS-style rifle -- a semiautomatic developed by the Soviets in the 1940s -- along with a scope, a GoPro digital camera, two bags and a black plastic bag containing food, prosecutors said.
The SKS rifle has appeared around the world in various conflicts and is popular in the United States, given its relatively low cost of around several hundred dollars.
Mr. Routh was identified by a witness near the golf club who saw him jump into a black Nissan SUV and speed away. He was arrested by local sheriff's deputies after heading northbound on Interstate 95.
A brief segment of body camera video released by local officials shows his roadside arrest at 2:14 p.m. on Sunday. The video, less than a minute long, shows several law enforcement officers from the back, with their weapons drawn, shouting instructions for the driver to take two steps to his right and then to walk backward toward them.
Mr. Routh, wearing sunglasses, dark pants and boots, is briefly seen in the video walking backward with his arms in the air, holding the hem of his shirt over his head, before officers handcuff him and take him into custody.
Mr. Routh has a significant criminal record, including a 2002 conviction in North Carolina for possessing a weapon of mass destruction after he barricaded himself at his place of business with a gun, according to the court filing. The F.B.I. said he had numerous felony convictions for stolen goods.
His criminal record bars him from legally possessing a firearm under federal law.
The F.B.I. disclosed at the news conference that someone had passed a tip to the F.B.I. in 2019 that he was in possession of a firearm despite being a felon. The F.B.I. interviewed the person who made the claim, but did not receive any more information and the case was closed.
The serial number on the semiautomatic rifle recovered by investigators, including a contingent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, was scratched off, making it more difficult to trace its origins, according to officials familiar with the investigation.
The weapon has been sent to the F.B.I.'s laboratory in Quantico, Va., where experts will try to determine the serial number. If that does not work, it could be sent to the A.T.F.'s lab, the officials said.
Mr. Routh was charged with possession of a weapon as a convicted felon and for obliterating the serial number of a firearm. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison or a $ 500,000 fine.
He could be charged with additional crimes as the investigation continues.
The Secret Service plans to conduct an internal review of the security episode at the Florida golf course similar to the review being conducted for the Butler shooting, said Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for the service.
At the news conference in Florida, Ric L. Bradshaw, the Palm Beach County sheriff, said that he had spoken with Mr. Trump and that the former president told him he felt "safe."
Mr. Trump on Monday morning claimed that "inflammatory language" from Democrats had provoked what the authorities are investigating as an assassination attempt against him, urging his rivals to tone down their speech even as he called them the "enemy from within" and "the real threat."
President Biden spoke with Mr. Trump on Monday, a White House official said, and conveyed relief that he was safe. The two shared a cordial conversation and Mr. Trump expressed his thanks for the call, the official said.
Mr. Biden told reporters on Monday that the Secret Service "needs more help."
Mr. Routh was interviewed by The New York Times in 2023 for an article about Americans volunteering to aid the war effort in Ukraine. Mr. Routh, who had no military experience, said he had traveled there after Russia's invasion in 2022 to recruit Afghan soldiers for the fight.
He told The Times he once visited Washington to meet with politicians to strengthen support for Ukraine, though the organization he claimed to be speaking with, known as the Helsinki Group, said it had no record of contact with him.
"I'm just a U.S. citizen that's helping out," he said at the time.

WASHINGTON — The man arrested after pointing a rifle through a fence ringing former President Donald Trump’s golf course in Florida on Sunday never got off a shot, but he appears to have remained undetected for nearly 12 hours before being spotted by a Secret Service agent who drove him off with a volley of gunfire, officials said Monday.

Full text: The Federal Bureau of Investigation said it was investigating what appeared to be a second assassination attempt on former President Donald J. Trump.
Former President Donald J. Trump was playing golf on Sunday afternoon in Florida when a Secret Service agent spotted a man with a rifle standing by a chain-link fence on the perimeter of the course, law enforcement officials said.
The agents opened fire, and the man fled in a black Nissan but was eventually taken into custody, the officials said.
While Mr. Trump was safe and unharmed, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it was investigating the episode as an apparent attempted assassination, the second one against the former president in just over two months. Mr. Trump was wounded in a previous attempt during a July 13 rally in Butler, Pa.
The suspected gunman was identified as Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, of Hawaii, according to a law enforcement official who was granted anonymity to describe an open investigation.
The episode unfolded around 1:30 p.m. on Sunday as Mr. Trump was golfing at the Trump International Golf Course West Palm Beach, Sheriff Ric Bradshaw of Palm Beach County said at a news briefing.
A Secret Service agent standing a hole or two away from Mr. Trump saw the armed man hiding in the shrubbery by a fence at the perimeter of the course, according to Sheriff Bradshaw. The Secret Service fired at the man, said Rafael Barros, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service's Miami field office, though it was not immediately clear if the suspect had fired any shots.
Mr. Trump was perhaps 400 yards away from the armed man, Sheriff Bradshaw said.
A semiautomatic rifle with a scope was found near the property line, along with two backpacks that were hung on the fence. The backpacks contained ceramic tile, and investigators also found a video camera, the sheriff said, adding that investigators believed the man might have intended to film the shooting.
"President Trump is safe following gunshots in his vicinity," Steven Cheung, the Trump campaign's communications director, said in a statement.
A witness saw the man flee from the bushes to a black Nissan, the sheriff said. The witness took a photo of the car and shared it with law enforcement officials. The man was stopped driving northbound on Interstate 95 after crossing into Martin County.
Law enforcement officials are running a trace to determine who bought the gun and where it was sold, according to two officials with knowledge of the situation.
Mr. Routh was interviewed by The New York Times in 2023 for an article about Americans volunteering to aid the war effort in Ukraine. Mr. Routh, who had no military experience, said he had traveled to the country after Russia's invasion in 2022 to recruit Afghan soldiers to fight there. He told The Times he once visited Washington to meet with politicians to strengthen support for Ukraine. "I'm just a U.S. citizen that's helping out," he said.
Mr. Trump was golfing with his friend Steve Witkoff, a New York real estate investor, when the shots were fired, according to three people briefed on the matter. Mr. Trump later returned to Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach estate. His campaign sent two fund-raising emails connected to the episode. "There are people in this world who will do whatever it takes to stop us," one of them said.
Golf courses can pose a security challenge for protecting the former president. Though they offer few places to hide, they also feature vast spaces and few places to take cover. During the news briefing, Sheriff Bradshaw acknowledged that the level of security on Sunday would have been higher if Mr. Trump were the sitting president.
Vice President Kamala Harris said on social media that she had been briefed on the shooting. "I am glad he is safe," she wrote. "Violence has no place in America."
President Biden said in a statement that he had been briefed on the investigation.
"I am relieved that the former president is unharmed," Mr. Biden said. "There is an active investigation into this incident as law enforcement gathers more details about what happened. As I have said many times, there is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country, and I have directed my team to continue to ensure that Secret Service has every resource, capability and protective measure necessary to ensure the former president's continued safety."
Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, posted on social media that he had spoken with Mr. Trump and he was "in good spirits."
Mr. Trump talked to friends and allies throughout the afternoon, according to two people briefed on the scene inside Mar-a-Lago, and cracked jokes about how he was frustrated he couldn't finish his golf game.
Mr. Trump's former White House doctor, Representative Ronny L. Jackson, said he spoke to Trump on Sunday afternoon.
"He told me he was always glad to hear from me, but he was glad he didn't need my services today," Dr. Jackson said. "I just told him I was glad he was OK, and he said he can't believe this happened."

The FBI said Sunday that it was investigating what appeared to be an attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump as he played golf at one of his clubs in Florida.
Officials said Trump was safe. Just two months ago, he was wounded in an assassination attempt during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.
Trump was golfing at the Trump International Golf Course West Palm Beach when the incident unfolded around 1:30 p.m. Sunday, Sheriff Ric Bradshaw of Palm Beach County said at a news briefing.
A Secret Service agent saw an armed man hiding in the shrubbery surrounding the golf course, according to Bradshaw. The Secret Service fired at the man, said Rafael Barros, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service’s Miami field office. It was not immediately clear if the suspect had fired any shots.
Trump was one or two holes away from the Secret Service on the golf course — and perhaps 400 yards away from the armed man, Bradshaw said.
An AK-47-style rifle with a scope was found near the property line, along with a video camera, the sheriff added.
“President Trump is safe following gunshots in his vicinity,” Steven Cheung, the Trump campaign’s communications director, said in a statement.
A witness saw the suspect flee from the bushes to a black Nissan. The witness took a photo of the car and shared it with law enforcement officials. The suspect was stopped driving northbound on Interstate 95 after crossing into Martin County.

Vice President Kamala Harris said on social media that she had been briefed on the incident. “I am glad he is safe,” she wrote. “Violence has no place in America.”
In a statement, a White House official said President Joe Biden had also been briefed, along with Harris. “They are relieved to know that he is safe,” the official said.
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., posted on social media that he had spoken with Trump and he was “in good spirits.”

Full text: This specialty streamer offers live TV along with a robust collection of free, ad-supported movies.
If we're being honest, the streaming app that your correspondent uses most -- more than Netflix or Amazon Prime or Hulu, and more than any of the less-recognizable subscription streamers we've previously spotlighted here -- is Plex, though for reasons owing less to its current iteration than to its humble beginnings.
Plex launched in the late 2000s as free media-server software, allowing its users to set up a client-server on either their home computer or on a network-attached storage device for their personal libraries of movies, television episodes and music. Setup and integration are fairly simple, and once the app has been directed to the user's files, it matches titles to its database of films and shows, which can be streamed to a variety of devices (including Roku, Apple TV, Amazon Fire and smart TVs). Best of all, you can share your libraries with friends, and vice versa, for either individual or "watch together" viewing. It's a nifty way to watch whatever you want, wherever you want -- for free, at least in its basic form. (The paid "Plex Pass" offers additional bells and whistles.)
Of course, it's difficult for a service to make money functioning solely as a free app for personal streaming, so Plex began expanding its offerings and utility in recent years. In 2019, the app added live TV streaming and DVR functionality, allowing its users the option of full-on cord cutting for an additional monthly fee. The following year, Plex introduced its ad-supported video on demand (AVOD) streaming service and free-to-stream live TV channels. As with Tubi, Pluto TV and other AVOD services, the automated commercial breaks aren't always executed with finesse; the breaks sometimes fall mid-scene, or even midsentence. But it's hard to complain when it comes with a $ 0 price tag.
This February, Plex launched another feature: a VOD rental service, allowing viewers to shell out a few bucks to stream new releases in the app, rather than in Amazon, Apple or Vudu. Sure, it's a revenue-generator, but it also helps make Plex, in its own words, something of a concierge service. With the "Universal Watchlist" function, you tell the app which streaming services you use, and thereafter, whenever you add a movie or show to your watchlist, it will show you where to find it: via one of your other services, in a media library (yours or a friend's) or through Plex's own AVOD or VOD portals. It essentially makes the app the center of your streaming universe, and in an increasingly convoluted digital media landscape, that's a useful function indeed.
Here are a few highlights from their current AVOD offerings:
'Master of the Flying Guillotine': This 1976 wuxia epic from the writer, director and star Jimmy Wang Yu is one of the era's most beloved martial arts extravaganzas. Technically a sequel to Wang Yu's smash "One-Armed Boxer" from the previous year, this tale of a blind warrior seeking revenge against Wang Yu's antihero is full of clever innovations and complications in its plentiful action sequences. Most impressively, the filmmaker shoots his action scenes the way a fighter fights, up close and personal, with the graceful camera right in the middle of the bone-cracking action.
'I'm Not There': With the James Mangold-directed Bob Dylan biopic "A Complete Unknown" hitting theaters at Christmas, here's your periodic reminder that there's already a fabulous Dylan movie out in the world -- albeit one perhaps too experimental and elliptical for the current cradle-to-grave iteration of the form. The director Todd Haynes instead adopted an approach mirroring the chameleonic nature of his subject, casting six different actors (of varying races and sexes) to play the singer-songwriter at various points of his colorful life, in shifting cinematic styles. The result is a picture as unpredictable, exhilarating and occasionally baffling as the figure at its center.
'BPM (Beats Per Minute)': The 2017 winner of the Cannes Grand Prix, this fierce and ferocious docudrama tells the story of the Paris chapter of the activist group Act Up, and its actions protesting government officials, pharmaceutical executives and public apathy toward AIDS patients in the 1990s. Much of that work is planned in the group's meetings and strategy sessions -- heated, passionate and complicated combinations of brainstorming and conflict resolution. In that way, the film is a process picture, and a fascinating one, but the writer and director Robin Campillo makes room for the tender stories of what happens outside of those rooms, and how the urgency of both halves of these activists' lives begin to blur. It's a tense, tough, candid dramatization of a fight where the stakes are truly life and death.
'Enemies, A Love Story': The director Paul Mazursky capped off a spectacular run of 1980s work with this tonally complex adaptation of Isaac Bashevis Singer's novel. Ron Silver (in perhaps his finest hour onscreen) stars as Herman Broder, a Holocaust survivor who has made a new life for himself in New York City circa 1949 -- more than one life, in fact, as he splits time between his wife (Malgorzata Zajaczkowska) in Coney Island and his mistress (Lena Olin) in the Bronx, an arrangement further complicated by the arrival of his presumed-dead, prewar wife, played with a seen-it-all wariness by Anjelica Huston. Mazursky, who wrote the script with Roger L. Simon, mines the comedy-of-manners (and outright farce) elements with expected grace, but he also lends proper weight to the morality of the tale, conjuring an underlying melancholy throughout, which surfaces adroitly in the affecting conclusion.
'QT8: The First Eight': The director Tara Wood's 2019 documentary covers, per its title, the filmography of Quentin Tarantino through "The Hateful Eight," via behind-the-scenes footage, copious clips and an impressive array of interviews (though not with the man himself, alas). It's not all softballs, thankfully, as she covers several of his controversies and the then-recent fall of his regular distributor and financier, Harvey Weinstein. But it offers plenty of context for fans both rabid and casual, cleverly adopting the director's cinematic trademarks (chapter headings, animations), and informatively breaking down his process.

Saying Goodbye to Life With a Leaving Party: [Style Desk]

Full text: Modern, even hip, mortuaries around the world are hoping to answer one question: How do we commemorate death in 2024?
In the affluent neighborhood of Crouch End in London, a new business is attracting some attention. The storefront's blue-and-white facade is airy and minimalist. Three polka-dot vases on plinths sit in the window. To the casual observer, the space might look like an art gallery. But through the window is something a little more curious: a sea-foam-green box measuring 7 feet by 2 feet.
It's generally upon noticing the box that passers-by will do a double-take of the shop's signage: Exit Here. The polka dot vases aren't vases. They're urns. The box is a coffin. And in the back, unknown to them, is a 12-person morgue.
"We knew the name would be Marmite," said Oliver Peyton, a renowned restaurateur, comparing the polarized reactions to his funeral home's somewhat cheeky name to those elicited by the yeasty British spread. "You either love it or you hate it. My mother-in-law hates it."
Mr. Peyton, who founded the first branch of Exit Here in the neighborhood of Chiswick in 2019 as a modern alternative to traditional funeral parlors, is a familiar face on the British hospitality scene: He was the founder of the Atlantic Bar & Grill, a West London hot spot that closed in 2006, and he served as a judge on the BBC show "Great British Menu."
Mr. Peyton, 62, who is originally from Sligo, Ireland, became interested in the mortuary business while planning a funeral for his father, who died in 2010. He felt that there weren't enough choices in the process. "Funerals are historically a hand-me-down business," he said, adding that people tend to use the funeral parlor that's closest to their home.
He also believes funeral planning is not so different from hospitality. "It's still a service industry," he said. "We're taking care of people at a very heightened emotional period in their lives."
Exit Here is among a small group of funeral homes around the world -- like Sparrow in New York, Poppy's in London and Altima in Spain -- with a modern feel.
Exit Here's new Crouch End space, with its velvet upholstery and curved archways, resembles a fancy members-only club. Altima, a chain with 40 homes around the Catalonia region, works with the architecture firm Batlleiroig to build parlors that resemble art galleries, featuring marble and lattice brickwork. The walls at Sparrow are dusty rose and forest green, and there is always incense burning.
For funeral homes, they're surprisingly hip.
Looks aren't everything, of course. These businesses also tend to offer nontraditional services like support groups for the bereaved and memorials personalized down to every detail.
'It's Going to Be Fabulous'
Steven Wilson, 47, discovered Exit Here in 2020 on a walk near his house in Chiswick. "What a brilliant name," he thought to himself at the time. After being diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, which he eventually learned was terminal, he returned in March to start planning his own funeral.
Past memorials Mr. Wilson has attended have served as cautionary tales. When his boyfriend died in 2014, the minister knew nothing beyond his name. "They played a nine-minute medley of 'November Rain,"' Mr. Wilson said, adding that he "never once" heard his boyfriend play Guns N' Roses. "The whole thing was just utterly impersonal."
Mr. Wilson, who worked in philanthropy, said his own funeral was going to be "fabulous," using an alliterative curse word for emphasis. On the top of his hand was a freshly applied I.V. bandage.
He saw it as a gift to have the time to plan his own funeral. "It sounds strange, but I want people to enjoy it," he said. And so, sometime probably within the next six months, his friends and family will gather in his hometown, Aberdeen, Scotland, where his body will lie in a coffin draped in a rainbow flag.
Instead of traditional programs, memory books divided into eras of Mr. Wilson's life ("Very Taylor Swift," as he put it) will be handed out as Jo Napthine, a former West End star and a professional funeral celebrant, belts numbers from Mr. Wilson's favorite musicals: "Bring Me Home" from "Les Miserables"; "Somewhere" from "West Side Story"; "Tomorrow" from "Annie."
And later, at the crematory: "My Way" by Frank Sinatra.
The 'Sweetgreen' of Funeral Homes
For much of her life, Natividad Hawkins, who lives in Hillside, N.J., knew of only one funeral home in the Brooklyn neighborhood where she grew up. "It was where we all went when someone died," said Ms. Hawkins, who arranged her mother's funeral there in 2021. "The lady working there was very nice, but it was very much a transactional thing."
It was only last year after attending the funeral of her childhood best friend, held at Sparrow in Greenpoint, that Ms. Hawkins realized there were other options.
According to its founder, Erica Hill, people have been known to wander into Sparrow, which opened in 2021, thinking it's a spa. The home has a morgue and two "celebration rooms," as they're called, for memorials, as well as a shop, where candles and condolence cards with line drawings are sold.
Ms. Hawkins, who is now in her 50s and works in tech, was struck by how beautiful the space was and how uplifting the service for her friend turned out to be.
When her brother, Francis Ortega, died in October, Ms. Hawkins knew where she wanted to hold the funeral. "As a self-aware control freak, I appreciated the fact they were never like, 'This is how we do it,"' she said. "It was always, 'What do you want?"'
Ms. Hill, 61, said Sparrow's services were aimed at people who were looking for something that feels "warm and inviting."
She likened her business to Sweetgreen or SoulCycle. "They repackage something, rebrand it and make it look cool," she said. "What we're doing is in the same realm."
Nicola Tuer, the former chief operating officer at Sony Music in Britain and Ireland, was so taken with Exit Here's branding that she referred to it on the mood board for the funeral of her husband, Tim Tuer, when he died of a brain tumor in October. The memorial was held at the celebrity chef Rick Stein's seafood restaurant in the neighborhood of Barnes in London, in what was the eatery's first-ever funeral. There were personalized bottles of wine -- "Have a drink on me. Château Tuer 1961" -- and lovingly prepared memory books that bore the same typeface and color palette as Exit Here.
"I know it's a silly thing to say, but we liked beautiful things, as I think a lot of people do," Ms. Tuer, 58, said. Her husband was buried in a "gorgeous" Scandinavian coffin. "He'd have been happy to be there."
Doing Death Differently
Aesthetic developments seem to be a reflection of changing conversations around death. "Younger people especially are getting more comfortable talking about it," Ms. Hill of Sparrow said. Look at the rise in popularity of death doulas, who provide support for the dying -- and in some cases, the grieving, too. In the United States, end-of-life planning sites like Lantern and Cake, which are marketed toward millennials, easier to navigate and more transparent about their pricing, have sprung up.
Which is not to say that so-called traditional or mainstream funeral homes are not adapting. In recent years, Co-Op Funeralcare, one of the largest funeral services providers in the United Kingdom, has changed its tune. Advertisements are now geared toward not only personalization, but also fostering openness around death. In July, the company worked with Channel 4 on a television show called "Celebrity Send Off," in which stars and their loved ones plan and test-run a funeral.
Gill Stewart, the company's managing director, reiterated the importance of evolving alongside its clients. Co-Op has introduced more colors for its coffins and has started offering unconventional hearse options, like a fire truck or a double-decker red bus.
A recent study conducted by Co-Op, which involved 4,000 people in the U.K., found that 68 percent of participants see funerals as celebrations of life as opposed to somber occasions. Ms. Stewart said that it was important for families to have options at their funeral homes that reflect those beliefs.
Sparrow hosts events that reflect the evolving attitudes about funerals, like grief circles; a death-themed comedy show; guided meditations; and several death cafes, where people who are dying or coping with grief can eat pastries and connect. Exit Here, too, holds regular coffee gatherings for the bereaved.
Similar initiatives are underway at Poppy's, a funeral home the color of a clementine in South West London. An ad campaign for the company last year involved plastering tube stations around the city with posters that read: "1861 called. They want their funeral traditions back." The vehicles used by Poppy's to pick up the recently deceased are a soothing shade of lilac. They're also electric.
"Whatever you end up choosing or wanting for the funeral, you want to be treated like a human," said Poppy Mardall, 41, who worked for Sotheby's before pivoting to the mortuary business. You don't want to be "upsold on packages when you are grieving," she added.
The Price of Death
Of course, amid all this is the looming matter of cost. Mr. Wilson, for example, is using a "very nice" six-figure insurance payout, from a critical illness policy he took out a few years ago, to execute his funeral vision. "I'm extremely fortunate to have that money," he said.
But what all these places reiterate is that whatever the budget, they can typically make it work. "The perception, which drives me slightly mad, is that a place that looks nice will cost more," Mr. Peyton said.
In reality, personalized services do tend to come with a higher price tag -- but not always. For example, in addition to Exit Here's signature wooden coffin, which has a retail price of 1,950 pounds (about $ 2,500), there is also a biodegradable cardboard model that costs 570 pounds (about $ 730). As for the funerals themselves, prices are as extravagant as the service permits.
Last year, as found by the insurance company Sun Life in its long-running "Cost of Dying" report, the average cost of a "basic" funeral -- burial or cremation; funeral home fees; a midrange coffin; a limousine; and celebrant fees -- in London was 5,171 pounds (about $ 6,640).
In the U.S., according to a 2023 study conducted by the National Funeral Directors Association, the median cost for a funeral with a coffin and burial is $ 8,300 (then there is the burial plot itself, which can range from the hundreds to the tens of thousands, depending on the state and whether it's a public or private cemetery); if you choose cremation instead, that median cost comes down to $ 6,280.
Exit Here's pricing falls around that estimate, with an equivalent funeral starting at 5,819 pounds (about $ 7,500). At Poppy's, the cost is lower: A basic service starts at 4,448 pounds (about $ 5,700). And although it's not as stylish, Co-Op Funeralcare is even more affordable, with starter packages going for 3,900 pounds (about $ 5,000).
Growing the Clientele
Mortuaries, of course, will never lack for customers. But how do these modern homes attract business? Places like Exit Here rely mainly on word-of-mouth recommendations, largely because funerals tend to be private affairs. They aren't exactly shareable moments -- though that could be changing, too.
When Exit Here organized the funeral last year of Poppy Chancellor -- the artist and daughter of the "Downton Abbey" star Anna Chancellor -- who died at 36, guests shared photos of the "leaving party," as the service was called, on social media. Inside the West London crematory were big, beautiful banners emblazoned with slogans like "Embrace joy today" and "I want to see you dance again." In one video, guests were doing the limbo to the silky vocals and pulse of Beyoncé's hit song "Heated."
In 2024, the question of death is very much alive. And how we choose to answer it, well, that's a personal matter.

Chinese Self-Driving Start-Up to Go Public in U.S.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: WeRide, a $ 5 billion software maker, is set for an I.P.O. amid geopolitical risks and a rush by Chinese automotive tech firms to raise money in the United States.
One of China's leading autonomous driving start-ups is set to go public in New York as soon as this week, with the strained relationship between Beijing and Washington lurking in the background.
WeRide, which makes software that powers driverless vehicles, has given potential investors an extensive list of the many ways geopolitics could damage their investment.
Export controls on Chinese firms by the U.S. government could limit WeRide's access to advanced semiconductors. One WeRide supplier has been designated a "Chinese military company," which could complicate its supply chain if restrictions escalate. A crackdown on Chinese autonomous vehicle companies could curb WeRide's ability to use its technology in America.
The Chinese government, the company also said, "has significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of our business, and may intervene or influence our operations."
Any investment in a seven-year-old start-up in a nascent industry carries risk, but not always of the sandwiched-between-two-superpowers variety. Shares in WeRide are set to trade on the Nasdaq stock exchange.
WeRide, based in Guangzhou, is among a wave of Chinese electric vehicle and automotive technology companies turning to American financial markets for capital to fund their global ambitions, even as Washington enacts policies to freeze them out of the American market.
The Biden administration is expected to propose banning the most advanced automated driving software from China, according to two people who were briefed on the proposal. The ban would apply to all software at and above Level 3 or "conditional automation," when a vehicle drives autonomously but with a person behind the wheel who is prepared to intervene if necessary. The proposal adds another hurdle, in addition to onerous tariffs, for Chinese automakers looking to break into the U.S. market.
"The degree of difficulty in doing this in the U.S. is substantial today given the regulatory scrutiny that some of the Chinese offerings have been facing," said Josh Lerner, a Harvard Business School professor focused on venture capital and entrepreneurship.
Blue-chip start-ups with ties to China that would have listed in the United States before have looked elsewhere or run into geopolitical roadblocks.
Congress passed a law in April requiring ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok, to sell the popular social media app or face its ban in the United States. Shein, the fast-fashion retailer founded in China, had filed paperwork last year to go public in New York, but its focus has shifted to a London listing amid the growing acrimony between Beijing and Washington.
The fact that WeRide and others are still willing to endure such scrutiny, Professor Lerner said, is a testament to the challenges Chinese companies face raising money in China. The number of initial public offerings in mainland China fell 75 percent in the first half of 2024 as Chinese market regulators tightened listing requirements amid sluggish stock markets and a real estate market in crisis.
WeRide was founded in 2017 by Tony Xu Han, the company's chief executive and former chief scientist at the autonomous driving arm of Baidu, the tech giant. WeRide operates pilot robotaxi hailing services in China and the United Arab Emirates, while providing its self-driving software to carmakers. It also sells driverless buses, delivery vans and street sweepers.
The company has raised $ 1.4 billion and was last valued at around $ 5 billion, according to PitchBook, which tracks start-ups. WeRide has some notable investors including Alliance Ventures -- a fund from Nissan Motor, Renault Group and Mitsubishi Motors -- and the German auto parts manufacturer Robert Bosch.
Nvidia, the Silicon Valley giant that dominates the business of advanced chips, was also an early investor and is a key supplier.
The company said it was planning to raise up to $ 440 million in the offering and a private placement to investors, including some existing shareholders. WeRide said it generated $ 55 million in revenue in 2023, a 24 percent fall from a year earlier. The company continues to invest heavily in research and development, and its net loss has outstripped its revenue. It lost $ 268 million last year.
While it detailed risks in its public offering paperwork, as all companies going public are obligated to do, WeRide also downplayed the impact of trade measures aimed at keeping key technology out of Chinese hands.
WeRide said export controls blocked an unidentified chip supplier from supplying some of its semiconductors, but added that WeRide was unaffected because the restrictions did not include the chips it buys. Another supplier was tagged by the Pentagon as associated with China's military, but WeRide said it didn't think this would affect its ability to continue using that supplier. The company declined to comment, citing the customary "quiet period" restrictions ahead of the I.P.O.
WeRide has a small presence in the United States, restricted to research. The company is one of seven authorized by California to test vehicles without a safety driver present. Its 14 vehicles drove more than 40,000 miles on the state's roads last year, although all but roughly 50 of those miles were done with a safety driver present, according to data from California's Department of Motor Vehicles. Hundreds of driverless cars operated by Waymo, which is owned by Google's parent company, Alphabet, logged millions of miles in California last year.
This month, California's utility regulator approved a permit for WeRide to carry passengers in its autonomous cars with or without a safety driver in the areas around San Jose. It cannot offer rides to the general public.
However, most of WeRide's staff is in China, where much of its research is conducted. China has been aggressively expanding driverless car testing on public roads as part of a push to establish global leadership in the field.
Gene Munster, a managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management in Minneapolis, said WeRide faced "an uphill battle to win investor support given the multiple geopolitical risks."
By going public now, Chinese automotive technology companies might be hoping to raise considerable sums of money before the November election. A new U.S. president, Mr. Munster said, might "shut the U.S.-China I.P.O. window."
Pony.ai, another Chinese autonomous driving start-up, plans to list on Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange soon, according to an April announcement from China's securities regulator. Any Chinese company seeking a U.S. listing must get permission from the regulator.
Zeekr Intelligent Technology Holding, an electric vehicle maker, listed its shares in May, raising $ 441 million in the biggest public offering of a Chinese company since Didi Global went public in 2021. Zeekr shares are down 27 percent from its public offering price.
Didi, a ride hailing firm, was flying high when it went public without government permission. Didi had a dominant hold in China and a roster of impressive investors including Apple, which plowed $ 1 billion into the company in 2016. But Chinese regulators tightened the clamps on Didi.
Two days after its offering, regulators forced the company to stop registering new users in China and started an investigation into the company's practices. It took steps to block Didi from online app stores. Six months later, Didi said it would delist its shares from the New York Stock Exchange.

Britain Turns to an Old Idea to Address A Housing Shortage: New Towns: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On a baking hot afternoon in July, Firouz Thompson proudly drove down the freshly paved road that leads into Northstowe, a new town about six miles northwest of Cambridge, England.
"This is where the new town center will be," said Ms. Thompson, a Northstowe resident, as she pointed to an empty patch of land that will eventually include a market hall, convenience store, library and health center. Nearby there are already a high school and an all-ages special-needs school. Soon, a preschool will open.
By 2040, this former World War II airfield will be transformed into a thriving town with 10,000 homes and about 25,000 residents. Or, at least, the British government, regional officials and residents hope so.
Today, Northstowe has just 1,450 homes in a mixture of low apartment blocks and single-family houses, surrounded by fields, construction sites and newly planted trees that offer no respite from the heat. Nearly a decade after its groundbreaking, Northstowe has become an example of the sluggish pace at which Britain is chipping away at its housing crisis.
"The U.K. has had a worse housing crisis than most of its peer countries, for a longer period than most of its peer countries, whether in Europe or North America," said Anthony Breach, a researcher at Center for Cities, an urban policy think tank. Britain went from having one of the best housing stocks in Europe after World War II to falling behind, he added.
To address the growing need for homes, the country's governing Labour Party has vowed to "unleash" development and build 1.5 million homes over the next five years, a pace of house building last seen in the 1960s.
Part of Labour's strategy is to build new towns by expanding small communities or establishing settlements, reviving an idea from the 1940s. Within days of gaining office, Rachel Reeves, Britain's finance minister, announced that the government was stepping in to unblock stalled housing projects, including Northstowe.
"I moved here thinking, wow, a new community and, wow, a new school," said Ms. Thompson, one of the first people to move to Northstowe in 2017 and the town's representative on the county council. But she acknowledges that the development has been slow, a frustration to many of her fellow residents.
"It's hard to build a new town on the back of Covid and construction costs," which have risen sharply, she said.
Across the country, the problems date back further. Over the past few decades, the dwindling supply of new homes has snowballed into a housing crisis that has left Britain with a shortfall of more than four million homes, compared with the pace of house building in the average European country, according to the Center for Cities. As a result, house prices have soared and homelessness has climbed. The shortage has also made it difficult for people to relocate for good jobs and for companies to attract talented workers.
Much of the blame has been laid on the country's development planning system. In the late 1940s, a system was introduced that required permission to build from a planning authority, which was controlled by local residents. Around the same time, amid concerns about urban sprawl, "greenbelts" were created around cities to restrict development. Over the years, the planning system has led to delays as residents tend to be wary of new developments, while the protection of the greenbelts has forced building away from areas with existing infrastructure.
It was "a historical accident" that Britain's planning system became so restrictive, Mr. Breach said. And it was made worse by the rise of "NIMBYism" -- the not-in-my-backyard phenomenon in which people oppose local development.
"Our discretionary system in the U.K. is extremely case by case, unpredictable," he said. "Even if you follow the rules, you can still be denied planning permission."
To overcome resistance, the Labour government has reintroduced mandatory building targets for local authorities in England that will cumulatively aim to deliver 370,000 homes a year. Lawmakers said they would be more assertive in intervening on behalf of development, including plans to build power infrastructure, laboratories and data centers. Officials have said they will rely on private developers, not on local councils, which were key contributors in the past.
The government has a bigger ambition to revive the idea of new towns, a policy of the Labour Party that was introduced after World War II and was intended to direct building away from London. The first was Stevenage in 1946, less than 30 miles north of the capital. The best known is Milton Keynes, which was founded about 60 years ago and now has more than a quarter-million residents.
Last month, the government announced a task force to develop a strategy for new towns -- settlements of more than 10,000 homes -- and make recommendations for their locations within a year. The government has not set a target for the number of towns and acknowledges that they will take a long time to deliver.
"I don't think it's unrealistic to have spades in the ground on several of these large-scale new communities by the final year of the Parliament," which is in five years, Matthew Pennycook, the housing minister, told the BBC recently. "They will be fully up and running, in many instances, only in a second term if we get the privilege to have one."
But building the settlements can be divisive and hard to get right.
"The risk with new towns is that they are built too far outside of the commuting range of cities, and you try to build self-contained small economies," Mr. Breach said. The towns end up being "too small to really compete in the global economy, but then they're also too big to simply be charming little villages with high amenities."
After the 1946 New Towns Act, waves of these communities were developed over the next few decades. Some, like Skelmersdale, which is north of Liverpool and poorly connected to the city, have struggled. The official "new town" designation was last used in 1970, but large, new settlements have been built since, such as Ebbsfleet Valley in Kent and Cambourne in Cambridgeshire.
For years, Cambridgeshire, the county that is home to Northstowe, has been racing to build more homes. The reputation of the University of Cambridge has made it a hub for innovative science businesses, but employers say they are struggling to attract workers because housing is so expensive. Home prices are 13 times the average annual earnings in the city, and 10 times in the surrounding area.
The crisis has businesses asking if Cambridge is right for them, said Bridget Smith, the leader of the South Cambridgeshire District Council, the local authority responsible for planning. "For these companies, it's Cambridge or it's abroad."
The area has plans for nine large-scale housing developments with more than 36,000 new homes by the late 2040s. That includes expansions to Cambourne and Eddington, a flourishing development built on land carved out of the greenbelt and funded by the university.
The council says it is not just the planning system that obstructs house building but a string of other issues as well, including stretched council finances, high interest rates, water scarcity and long waits for connections to the power grid.
Homes England, the government's housing and regeneration agency and the main planner in Northstowe, acknowledges that the town got off to a rough start. The first phase, built by a different developer, "had not been fully successful" and had lacked the necessary social infrastructure, said Peter Denton, the chief executive of the agency.
"The level of investment upfront that was required to make Northstowe a proper success was reasonably substantial," he said. The agency helped build many of the roads, green spaces and schools, intending to recoup the money for the Treasury by selling plots of land ready for development.
In the past year, the town has gotten a sports center and a temporary community building, but there are still no stores and only limited medical facilities. The Northstowe Tap & Social opened just four months ago, serving coffee and pastries during the day and craft beer and burgers at night.
Early residents had to build the community from scratch. Ms. Thompson and one of her neighbors set up a group called Northstowe Foodies, which brings in food trucks to serve the town.
Victoria Fabron, 35, moved to the development two years ago, attracted to the modern design and prospects of a new town center. It felt "promising," she said, after leaving the community building on a recent afternoon. Ms. Fabron, who lives with her partner and two children, said that the community was "super active," but that people wanted more places to go.
"There's not tons to do, but I knew that when I moved here," she said, adding that she expected more amenities would come. "I just hope that they live up to their promises."
For others, the promises already feel broken. Karys Brown, 24, who moved to Northstowe just over a year ago with her 4-year-old daughter, said little had improved in that time, and she struggles to get around without a car. She has doubts about the town's future: "There's nothing certain about what it's going to be like."

Full text: After decades raising hogs in Iowa, they wanted a way out of factory farming. Their solution was a return to nature, and a lot of mushrooms.
For years Rand Faaborg, a father of five in rural Iowa, wanted to get out of hog farming. He just didn't know how.
He'd built two barns in 1991, a few hundred yards from the family's farmhouse, and fattened up thousands of hogs at a time. But by 2020, Mr. Faaborg was exhausted and making a fraction of what he'd earned from hogs three decades earlier. He and his wife felt trapped. They didn't want to raise hogs anymore or live alongside them, yet they had poured half a million dollars into paying off the loans on the barns and replacing the roofs.
"I don't know that I could even get across how much work we have spent over these decades down here with these buildings," said Mr. Faaborg, who is 67 and still working a day job in metal manufacturing, as he stood alongside the barns one sunny morning last month. "To just walk away from it, to let them fall to disrepair and bulldoze them down, it would be hard."
But this summer, with help from a nonprofit group and a leap of faith, the Faaborg farm is in the middle of a noisy, radical transformation. The Faaborgs have traded hogs for mushrooms in an effort to restore balance to the land, and to their lives.
The last of their hogs shipped out in the fall of 2022. Mushrooms for medicinal tinctures and a coffee blend are now being grown in an outbuilding, and a hog barn is being retrofitted to grow specialty mushrooms. Elsewhere on the land, hundreds of native trees have been planted and a pollinator-friendly field has been sown. A sediment-choked creek is set to be restored, and the open lagoon that once held a million gallons of hog waste is being converted into a freshwater pond.
The person driving the changes is Rand Faaborg's second-oldest son, Tanner Faaborg, 40. He hopes to make his family's farm a blueprint in the Midwest, to show how people can leave industrial farming, grow environmentally friendly and profitable food, and, in turn, help rebuild hollowed-out communities.
"I want to make rural America a place where people want to live and grow up in," Tanner Faaborg said. Absent significant changes, he said, the heartland will end up becoming "one big manufacturing plant."
"That's not what I want to see," he said.
Rand and Tammy Faaborg moved their family from the town of Nevada, Iowa, outside Ames, to the 25-acre farm northeast of Des Moines in 1986, wanting a country life. They lived frugally, growing, canning and freezing their own fruits and vegetables, and making their own clothes. The animals they raised lived in fields and had names.
Shortly after Tanner turned 8, his parents decided to go into the business of running a concentrated agricultural feeding operation, or CAFO, also known as a factory farm. The Faaborgs could take out a loan for no money down to build hog barns. A pork producer would supply thousands of young hogs and feed, and the Faaborgs would raise them and dispose of the manure. The income would supplement the $ 6 an hour that Rand Faaborg earned as a welder.
"The offer sounded so good, and we had such little money," Tanner Faaborg said.
It was round-the-clock work. The barns were filled with small pens that each held nearly two dozen hogs, for a total of 1,100 hogs per barn. The animals never went outside. They grew more stressed and aggressive as time went on, knocking over and biting whoever went into the pens to scrape away manure, the Faaborgs said.
Once the hogs reached six months old and 280 pounds each, they were sent to slaughter. Loading them onto waiting trucks took Rand Faaborg and the children all night, and afterward he'd head straight to his day job and the kids went to school. The family would spend the next few days pressure-washing the barns before another 2,200 young hogs would be delivered and the cycle would begin again. They gave vast amounts of manure to crop farmers to fertilize fields.
Over the years, the communities around the Faaborgs changed. Small farms disappeared as older farmers retired or died and their children moved away. The land was swallowed up by large agricultural companies. Iowa is now home to 4,000 factory farms, more than any other state. It also produces the most animal waste, which generates a significant amount of greenhouse gasses and contaminates waterways. After torrential downpours this past spring and summer, environmentalists warned of floodwaters carrying untreated animal waste, which they called "fecal soup."
"I don't think people really understand the extent of that growth and the negative impact that it's had on our rural communities," Tanner Faaborg said. "There's been population declines, small towns in Iowa are dying. With consolidation comes efficiencies, but at what cost?"
Tanner Faaborg never thought he'd return to the farm. He attended the University of Iowa and spent three years traveling the world before he returned to Des Moines to lead Urban Ambassadors, a nonprofit organization that created a climate action and adaptation plan for the city and plants trees and holds trash cleanups.
In 2016, Tanner Faaborg persuaded his parents to install solar panels that ended up powering everything on the farm, including the hog buildings. The extra energy fed into the electric grid, so instead of paying electric bills, the Faaborgs collected checks from the utility. Rand Faaborg was so impressed that when his old car conked out, he bought an electric Nissan Leaf. "My commute was all on sunlight for the last ten years," he said.
By 2020, the economics of agricultural consolidation had taken their toll on the farm. Rand Faaborg once earned a reliable annual income from the hogs, despite loan payments on the barns. But by then, profit had shrunk to less than $ 15,000 a year.
In the meantime, Tanner Faaborg was searching for ways to help his parents leave hog farming without losing their investment in the barns. He connected with the Transfarmation Project, an initiative run by the farm-animal welfare charity Mercy for Animals that helps people transition out of industrial animal agriculture and into growing specialty crops. Out of the replacement crops they suggested, Tanner Faaborg seized on mushrooms, intrigued by their potential to heal ailments and serve as a superfood.
He first had to convince his parents. Until that point, Rand Faaborg's consumption of fungi had largely been limited to the occasional can of Campbell's cream of mushroom soup.
"It was foreign to us," Rand Faaborg said. "It's like most things. You don't know what you don't know."
But the more Tanner Faaborg researched mushrooms, the more excited he grew, especially after Transfarmation connected him with a grower in upstate New York, Steve Gabriel, that he calls his "mushroom guru." Over the next two years, he convinced not only his parents, but his older brother, Tyler, who himself had spent decades raising hogs and was suffering from bad shoulders and knees after hauling dozens of dead animals out of pens each day.
Tyler Whitley, the director of the Transfarmation Project, describes himself as a "farmer social worker." His group talks to farmers, learns about their equipment and buildings and whether it's tied to debt, explores what plant-based alternatives might work, and matches them with resources.
Transfarmation awarded the Faaborgs a $ 15,000 grant for a pilot project cultivating reishi, lion's mane and oyster mushrooms inside tents in one of the farm's outbuildings. It provided another $ 200,000 toward redesigning and converting one of the Faaborgs' hog barns, Mr. Whitley said.
Mr. Whitley said that of the hundreds of farmers that have reached out, his team was working with 12 farms, seven of which have successfully transitioned out of factory farming, including the Faaborgs. Most of the farmers it has helped raised hogs or chickens on an industrial level using the same style of animal confinement. That uniformity enables the nonprofit group to offer blueprints for repurposing animal barns, Mr. Whitley said.
"We try to bring a systemization to it so it's scalable," he said.
Still, any transition to specialty farming is a risk. Tanner and Tyler have started selling medicinal tinctures, and coffee and salt flavored with mushrooms under the name 1100 Farm, a nod to the number of hogs each barn once held. But they need to secure buyers for thousands of pounds of fresh, specialty mushrooms they expect to produce each week.
Tanner Faaborg sold his house in Des Moines to help pay for the project, secured a government grant to convert the swine pit to a clean pond, and Tyler Faaborg contributed $ 75,000 from savings. They're still a few hundred thousand dollars short of the approximately $ 1 million it will cost to fully transition and rewild the farm, Tanner Faaborg said.
"It's a massive gamble, but we think it's worth it," he said.
If all goes well, the profits from mushrooms could exceed what the farm was generating from hogs during the best of times, without the backbreaking work and sounds and smells from the hog barns and waste pit. 1100 Farm is in the process of buying the land and buildings from Rand and Tammy Faaborg. "That's a big part of their retirement plan," Tanner Faaborg said.
In the meantime, Rand Faaborg has become a mushroom convert. He says the mushroom tinctures helped restore his sense of taste and smell, which he'd mysteriously lost a decade earlier. And Tammy, his wife, now cooks mushrooms in the kitchen and serves them on their hamburgers.
"It's been eye-opening," he said. "It's been very good."

A Quiet Policy Success: Cutting Veteran Homelessness in Half: [National Desk]

Full text: After two years in the Air Force and decades on Skid Row, Steve Allen was spending his senior years living in his car. John Sullivan, who joined the Army after seeing the film "Patton," slept on his son's couch. Home for Babs Ludikhuize, an Air Force veteran recovering from domestic violence, was in psychiatric care.
Now all three have comfortable apartments with subsidized rents, and they embody what many analysts call the greatest success in homelessness policy -- the decline in homeless veterans.
Since 2008, Congress, with bipartisan support, has spent billions on rental aid for unhoused veterans and cut their numbers by more than half, as overall homelessness has grown. Celebrated by experts and managed by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the achievement has gained oddly little public notice in a country in need of broader solutions.
Progress in the veterans program has slowed as rising rents displace more tenants and make it harder to help them regain housing. But while homelessness among veterans rose last year, the increase was smaller than other groups faced. Admirers say the program's superior performance, even in a punishing rental market, offers a blueprint for helping others and an answer to the pessimism in the debate over reducing homelessness.
"It is the best initiative on homelessness that the federal government has ever developed," said Philip F. Mangano, who helped launch the program under President George W. Bush. "The best. By far. If we can do it for veterans, we can do it for others."
No place illustrates the hard-fought progress more than Los Angeles, which serves more homeless veterans than any other city and has gravity-defying rents.
The housing shortage has shifted power to landlords, who are wary of homeless applicants and sometimes complain that the aid program brings red tape. While the federal government has provided veterans in Los Angeles with thousands of vouchers to help pay landlords, nearly half of the vouchers remain unused because the veterans cannot find places to rent.
With progress stalled, the veterans department changed local leadership, hired more staff and expanded community partnerships to court landlords. As the changes took hold last year, homelessness among veterans in Los Angeles fell by nearly a quarter, while homelessness among other people in the region rose slightly.
"The outcomes show what we're doing is effective," said John Kuhn, the veterans department official who now runs the Los Angeles program.
In housing Mr. Allen, the Air Force veteran, the department teamed up with local officials who leased an entire building, protecting the owner's cash flow from the risk of vacancies. In exchange, the program received 13 new apartments in a desirable West Hollywood neighborhood.
"It's a miracle to me, nothing short of a miracle," Mr. Allen, 68, said of his 565 "exquisite" square feet of living space. Though he overcame years of heroin addiction and earned a bachelor's degree in his 60s, until recently he was recovering from cancer and managing diabetes while sleeping in a decade-old Nissan.
Without the rental aid, Mr. Allen said, "I'd probably be dead."
'Congress Has Provided Resources'
Veterans have higher rates of homelessness than other Americans, mostly because they come from more disadvantaged backgrounds but also because of service-related trauma.
As concerns about returning service members grew during wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Congress in 2008 revived a pilot program, called HUD-VASH, that pairs vouchers from the housing department with case management from the veterans department. Voucher holders pay 30 percent of their income for rent, while the federal government covers the rest up to a local ceiling.
After expanding the program every year, Congress has created about 110,000 vouchers, meaning veterans have much shorter waits for rental aid than other homeless groups. The vouchers cost more than $ 900 million a year.
"The fundamental reason why homelessness among veterans has fallen so much is that Congress has provided resources," Mr. Kuhn said.
Notably, the rental aid comes with no conditions: Services like drug treatment or mental health care are offered but not required. That approach, called Housing First, once enjoyed bipartisan support but has recently drawn conservative critics who say it promotes self-destructive behavior.
Supporters say the veterans' progress shows the strategy's merits.
"Housing First is responsible for cutting veterans' homelessness in half," said Ann Oliva, who runs the National Alliance to End Homelessness, an advocacy group.
But as rents rose and vacancies fell, progress slowed nationwide. Flooded with applications, landlords grew more selective. Some fear that the homeless make bad tenants and complain that the vouchers require exacting inspections that cost them time and money.
Many cities bar discrimination against people with vouchers, who are disproportionately Black, but the laws are hard to enforce. Voucher holders often complain that they can rent apartments only in the worst neighborhoods.
Of the 110,000 HUD-VASH vouchers available nationwide, the share being used to rent apartments last year fell to 74 percent, from 85 percent in 2017. That leaves about 28,000 unused vouchers -- enough to house most of the 35,000 remaining homeless veterans if the program placed more of them in apartments.
The veterans effort stands out in homelessness policy precisely because it is not primarily constrained by a lack of money. While there is nearly one voucher for every homeless veteran, among other Americans the ratio is about one for every seven homeless people, said Richard Cho, a senior federal housing official. "We're trying to replicate the veterans' success but don't have nearly the same resources for other people experiencing homelessness," he said.
Courting Landlords
Struggling with addiction or mental illness, some veterans reject housing aid. The Los Angeles program has intensified its outreach, hiring formerly homeless veterans to assist. It has also raised salaries to fill caseworker vacancies, which had proliferated during the coronavirus pandemic, slowing housing placements.
Above all, it has courted landlords. Through a strategy called master leasing, a local partner recently leased an entire building. The landlord received guaranteed rents, and the program got multiple apartments, a strategy it is trying to repeat.
Residential and Property Support Services, the strategy of a different partnership between the veterans department and local officials, tries to attract landlords with bonuses instead of guarantees. By reserving buildings for voucher-holding veterans, landlords can increase their revenue by as much as 15 percent. To address tenant issues, the initiative also provides an on-site manager.
Given legal constraints, the work demands inventive collaborations. The veterans department cannot sign master leases, so it worked with the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, a local government agency that can. The vouchers cannot pay landlords bonuses, so a nonprofit group, People Assisting the Homeless, does so with other government funds.
It can take multiple programs to house one veteran. Getting vouchers approved can take months, since the local housing authority has to inspect the apartment. Until then, rent for Mr. Allen's "exquisite" apartment comes from a program called Supportive Services for Veteran Families. The aid is temporary but faster, and covers moving costs and furniture, which vouchers do not.
The Los Angeles program has one asset most cities lack: a 388-acre campus in West Los Angeles that was donated to the government in the 1880s to house veterans. But the department has faced years of litigation for failing to house enough veterans there. After settling a lawsuit in 2015 and agreeing to build 1,200 apartments, it is being sued again for falling far behind schedule.
Only about 10 percent of the veterans housed last year were placed on campus. Still, with placements rising in other apartments, the number of homeless veterans in the region fell last year by 23 percent, while the count among nonveterans rose 1 percent.
Problems With Housing
Challenges remain. Though the program aims to blend housing and case management, casework is uneven. Weeks after gaining an apartment, Damien Wright, a former Marine who had been living in his car, said, "I don't know who my caseworker is."
Asked his caseworker's name, Anthony Robinson, 68, a recovering drug addict housed on the V.A. campus, said, "I don't know -- sometimes I don't remember my own name."
Some veterans dislike their buildings or neighborhoods. At 83, Iran Acton, was recently punched in the face and knocked down by another resident of a building filled with formerly homeless veterans. Though Mr. Acton calls his $ 350 rent a "godsend," he added, "Some of the clientele that are allowed to move in, they're not to my liking."
One focus of complaint is Building 207, which provides 59 apartments on the V.A. campus with an attractive common room, patio and grill. But a meeting with residents produced a chorus of complaints about nighttime drinking and drug use.
"One guy was losing his bodily functions in the common areas," said Mr. Sullivan, 68, who became homeless after his wife died and he could no longer afford their mobile home.
Ms. Ludikhuize, 62, said the disorder threatens her sobriety. She joined the Air Force after high school but left after being raped twice in 14 months. Years of domestic violence followed, along with anxiety, depression and methamphetamine use. Achieving sobriety, Ms. Ludikhuize got a job with the department's outreach team, only to relapse and return to homelessness.
Sober again, she is grateful for an apartment that costs her just $ 50 a month. But she returns from nightly meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous to the kind of atmosphere she should avoid.
"Half the building's drunk," she said. "It gets loud -- they fight with each other. I'm a little sensitive about that because of the domestic violence I survived."
A Unique Reach
Could the decline in veterans homelessness be replicated among other people? With more than 1,300 hospitals and clinics nationwide, the veterans department has a unique reach.
But the program's main advantage is political: Veterans attract bipartisan support. Congress has halved veterans' homelessness by offering deep, unconditional aid to people who in other contexts often draw scorn, including drug users, ex-offenders and the chronically unemployed.
Mr. Allen, whose struggles began with childhood molestation in a New Orleans housing project, spent more years in prison than he did in a job. Ms. Ludikuize's problems with drug use have spanned nearly four decades.
MacKenzie Harrell, 28, who transitioned to a woman after leaving the Navy, is especially conscious of her outcast status after growing up in Alabama as a "queer fat atheist" and developing an interest in "communist and anarchical thought."
Many people would "see me as a homeless trans person unworthy of money or care," she said, but a veteran's status redefines her as deserving.
"If I wasn't a veteran, I'd be in a graveyard," she said.
Whether the same generosity should apply to others is a question on which veterans are split. "We deserve special treatment," Mr. Allen insisted. "We agreed to defend this country."
Ms. Harrell disagreed, saying, "You shouldn't have to spend five years of your life as a cog in an imperialist machine to get help."
Sitting in the courtyard where another veteran knocked him down, Mr. Acton said that "veterans deserve special treatment." He then paused and added, "But there are other people who deserve special treatment, too."

Riots Push English City To Reflect on Religion, Immigration and Race: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Days after an angry crowd marauded through Sunderland, people in the industrial port city are trying to make sense of what just happened.
Last Friday afternoon, as the pubs in the northeastern English city of Sunderland were filling with young men, Lesley McLaren made a decision: She was closing up shop early.
She had heard about the riots in Southport after three children there were killed in a stabbing attack. Now, she worried that trouble might be coming to her own city.
She did not want to be out when the storm broke. And given the anti-immigrant fervor and racism that have marked the riots, she especially didn't want her Sikh co-worker in the convenience shop, Simran Singh, to be on the streets.
"It's too dangerous for him," she said of Mr. Singh, adding, "because of the color of his skin."
Just hours later, a violent mob swept through the streets. Rioters attacked police officers, looted stores, burned buildings and set a car on fire. Elsewhere in England and Northern Ireland the next day, people rioted in about a dozen other cities.
Much of the rioting was set in motion by false claims circulating online that the suspect accused in the stabbing rampage in Southport was an undocumented migrant. He was born and raised in Wales, the authorities say; the BBC has reported that his parents were from Rwanda. The police have not disclosed a motive for the stabbing attack, if they have determined one. Britain has very tight restrictions on what can be reported once a case is underway.
In interviews this week, some Sunderland residents were appalled by the violence, even those who said they understood why people might be frustrated by Britain's sharply increased rate of immigration, most of it legal.
"Why trash your own town?" asked Peter Wilson, 69, who works in the Sunderland offices of the Citizens Advice charity, which helps people in crisis navigate debt, legal issues, housing problems and other challenges. Rioters burned some of the charity's offices, though it was unclear if they were the target since they are next to a former police building that still says "police."
"Ransacking a vape shop in support of families in Southport -- how does this help anybody?" Mr. Wilson said, shaking his head.
But some point to the economic stagnation that has sapped the city of its vitality as an underlying cause of anger.
"It's left a very fertile soil for far-right and extremist racist views to take root," said the Rev. Clare MacLaren of Sunderland Minster, the city's Anglican cathedral. She added that anti-immigrant proponents had successfully preyed over time on those who felt left behind and needed someone to blame "because these people feel disenfranchised, abandoned, neglected, hopeless, fearful for the future."
On Friday, the accumulated anger spilled over, even as residents voiced suspicions that some rioters were from out of town and were anti-immigrant agitators. One said people reported hearing accents that were not local.
In the aftermath of the violence, some have been looking at their own city with new eyes, and trying to make sense of what happened.
Mainstream British lawmakers, from those in the newly seated Labour government to Conservatives who made migration clampdowns a campaign issue, have all denounced the violence and called for stiff punishments. Many have said frustration over a loss of control over migration does not justify or explain riots that resulted in dozens of injured police, looted shops and, in one case, a burned library.
A more ambiguous response came from Nigel Farage, the Brexit champion whose anti-immigrant Reform U.K. party came in second in the three parliamentary districts that cover Sunderland in last month's general election.
His initial reaction to the unrest was to question official information being put out about the attacker, which some critics fear fed the rioters' own suspicions. On Monday, after a weekend of mayhem in some places, he condemned the violence.
Sunderland has been quiet since the trouble on Friday. Now, its leaders and some of its residents are trying to move past that night, worried that it could undercut the city's efforts to improve its reputation.
"People here are pretty keen to be loud and clear about the fact that those right-wing elements, those folks, don't speak for the city," said Kim McGuinness, the region's mayor.
But for all the suspicion that outside agitators helped drive the violence, on some level, some residents acknowledge, the unrest reflected a discontent they share.
Frustrations run deep in the city, where residents have endured years of economic deprivation and joblessness. The city lost a quarter of its jobs from 1975 to 1989 as its coal mining and shipbuilding industries declined.
That decline and fears of what Mr. Farage then called uncontrolled migration from the European Union led to the Brexit vote, and Sunderland has been held up as a symbol of Britain's divisions.
The city was a bellwether for the debate over Brexit as a prime example of a Labour-leaning, predominantly white, working-class city with anxieties about migration and national identity, but one that had a major employer, Nissan, which threatened to move away if Brexit passed.
In the 2016 vote, Sunderland shocked many by voting for Brexit by 61.3 percent to 38.7, and its early result made it clear that the referendum was going to pass. In the end, Nissan stayed after an agreement with the E.U. over trade rules.
Now, although several people who were interviewed insist that Sunderland is "on the up," the repercussions of years being down still linger. The city's average wages, for example, are still lower than those in the rest of Britain, according to a recent economic master plan.
There have been other changes, some of which have become lightning rods for anti-immigrant feeling.
In 2022, Sunderland's City Council voted unanimously to become a City of Sanctuary, putting itself on record as welcoming asylum seekers and refugees, according to Kelly Chequer, the council's deputy leader.
For some residents, such openness remains a problem. "A lot of it is the fact that, if you're white, you get branded a thug or a terrorist," said Rob Patterson, 75, who, like his wife, was born in Sunderland. "You're automatically a racist. But it's actually the other way around."
His wife, Marjorie, added that there was so much migration that "we don't even know our own country anymore." And both believe the stabbing suspect was an illegal immigrant, despite the government's denials.
Zaf Iqbal, a leader of the Sunderland Inter Faith Forum, said there had always been "an undertone of racism in Sunderland, but over the years, we've done a lot of work against that." Still, he locked himself inside his mosque with fellow worshipers during the riots on Friday and said the city had been "a ticking time bomb since Brexit."
Ms. McLaren, the convenience store worker, said she had banned some customers who have said racist things to Mr. Singh over time. But she also said that many people in the city were frustrated by what they see as government handouts for asylum seekers. "I do see the point," she said.
"Where are we going to put everybody?" she asked. "We can't house our own. We've got pensioners who can't put the heating on. And we're bringing more people in?"
Nearby, Mr. Singh silently sold cigarettes and lottery tickets to a steady stream of customers. Many paid in exact change, counted out coin by coin.
Mr. Singh, who said he had moved to Britain in 2017, declared himself heartbroken by the riots. On Tuesday afternoon, the police could be seen taking away a person who he said had shouted racist remarks at him. "I'm totally afraid," he said, his hands shaking.
The door to the convenience store is still broken: Tape laces across a gaping glassless window. Other shops in the city's center are boarded up or their windows have spider webs of cracked glass.
But the city is trying to recover.
A day after the riots, residents came out to clean the streets, sweeping debris as early light broke.
Then on Sunday, some residents gathered for a walk of peace.

Decline in Veterans’ Homelessness Spurs Hopes for a Broader Solution

LOS ANGELES — After two years in the Air Force and decades on Skid Row, Steve Allen was spending his senior years living in his car. John Sullivan, who joined the Army after seeing the film “Patton,” slept on his son’s couch. Home for Babs Ludikhuize, an Air Force veteran recovering from domestic violence, was in psychiatric care.
Now all three have comfortable apartments with subsidized rents, and they embody what many analysts call the greatest success in homelessness policy — the decline in homeless veterans.
Since 2008, Congress, with bipartisan support, has spent billions on rental aid for unhoused veterans and cut their numbers by more than half, as overall homelessness has grown. Celebrated by experts and managed by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the achievement has gained oddly little public notice in a country in need of broader solutions.
Progress in the veterans program has slowed as rising rents displace more tenants and make it harder to help them regain housing. But while homelessness among veterans rose last year, the increase was smaller than other groups faced. Admirers say the program’s superior performance, even in a punishing rental market, offers a blueprint for helping others and an answer to the pessimism in the debate over reducing homelessness.
“It is the best initiative on homelessness that the federal government has ever developed,” said Philip F. Mangano, who helped launch the program under President George W. Bush. “The best. By far. If we can do it for veterans, we can do it for others.”
No place illustrates the hard-fought progress more than Los Angeles, which serves more homeless veterans than any other city and has gravity-defying rents.
The housing shortage has shifted power to landlords, who are wary of homeless applicants and sometimes complain that the aid program brings red tape. While the federal government has provided veterans in Los Angeles with thousands of vouchers to help pay landlords, nearly half of the vouchers remain unused because the veterans cannot find places to rent.
With progress stalled, the veterans department changed local leadership, hired more staff and expanded community partnerships to court landlords. As the changes took hold last year, homelessness among veterans in Los Angeles fell by nearly a quarter, while homelessness among other people in the region rose slightly.
“The outcomes show what we’re doing is effective,” said John Kuhn, the veterans department official who now runs the Los Angeles program.
In housing Allen, the Air Force veteran, the department teamed up with local officials who leased an entire building, protecting the owner’s cash flow from the risk of vacancies. In exchange, the program received 13 new apartments in a desirable West Hollywood neighborhood.
“It’s a miracle to me, nothing short of a miracle,” Allen, 68, said of his 565 “exquisite” square feet of living space. Although he overcame years of heroin addiction and earned a bachelor’s degree in his 60s, until recently he was recovering from cancer and managing diabetes while sleeping in a decade-old Nissan.
Without the rental aid, Allen said, “I’d probably be dead.”
‘Congress Has Provided Resources’
Veterans have higher rates of homelessness than other Americans, mostly because they come from more disadvantaged backgrounds but also because of service-related trauma.
As concerns about returning service members grew during wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Congress in 2008 revived a pilot program, called HUD-VASH, that pairs vouchers from the housing department with case management from the veterans department. Voucher holders pay 30% of their income for rent, while the federal government covers the rest up to a local ceiling.
After expanding the program every year, Congress has created about 110,000 vouchers, meaning veterans have much shorter waits for rental aid than other homeless groups. The vouchers cost more than $900 million a year.
“The fundamental reason why homelessness among veterans has fallen so much is that Congress has provided resources,” Kuhn said.
Notably, the rental aid comes with no conditions: Services like drug treatment or mental health care are offered but not required. That approach, called Housing First, once enjoyed bipartisan support but has recently drawn conservative critics who say it promotes self-destructive behavior.
Supporters say the veterans’ progress shows the strategy’s merits.
“Housing First is responsible for cutting veterans’ homelessness in half,” said Ann Oliva, who runs the National Alliance to End Homelessness, an advocacy group.
But as rents rose and vacancies fell, progress slowed nationwide. Flooded with applications, landlords grew more selective. Some fear that the homeless make bad tenants and complain that the vouchers require exacting inspections that cost them time and money.
Many cities bar discrimination against people with vouchers, who are disproportionately Black, but the laws are hard to enforce. Voucher holders often complain that they can rent apartments only in the worst neighborhoods.
Of the 110,000 HUD-VASH vouchers available nationwide, the share being used to rent apartments last year fell to 74%, from 85% in 2017. That leaves about 28,000 unused vouchers — enough to house most of the 35,000 remaining homeless veterans if the program placed more of them in apartments.
The veterans effort stands out in homelessness policy precisely because it is not primarily constrained by a lack of money. While there is nearly one voucher for every homeless veteran, among other Americans the ratio is about 1 for every 7 homeless people, said Richard Cho, a senior federal housing official. “We’re trying to replicate the veterans’ success but don’t have nearly the same resources for other people experiencing homelessness,” he said.
Courting Landlords
Struggling with addiction or mental illness, some veterans reject housing aid. The Los Angeles program has intensified its outreach, hiring formerly homeless veterans to assist. It has also raised salaries to fill caseworker vacancies, which had proliferated during the coronavirus pandemic, slowing housing placements.
Above all, it has courted landlords. Through a strategy called master leasing, a local partner recently leased an entire building. The landlord received guaranteed rents, and the program got multiple apartments, a strategy it is trying to repeat.
Residential and Property Support Services, the strategy of a different partnership between the veterans department and local officials, tries to attract landlords with bonuses instead of guarantees. By reserving buildings for voucher-holding veterans, landlords can increase their revenue by as much as 15%. To address tenant issues, the initiative also provides an on-site manager.
Given legal constraints, the work demands inventive collaborations. The veterans department cannot sign master leases, so it worked with the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, a local government agency that can. The vouchers cannot pay landlords bonuses, so a nonprofit group, People Assisting the Homeless, does so with other government funds.
It can take multiple programs to house one veteran. Getting vouchers approved can take months, since the local housing authority has to inspect the apartment. Until then, rent for Allen’s “exquisite” apartment comes from a program called Supportive Services for Veteran Families. The aid is temporary but faster, and covers moving costs and furniture, which vouchers do not.
The Los Angeles program has one asset most cities lack: a 388-acre campus in West Los Angeles that was donated to the government in the 1880s to house veterans. But the department has faced years of litigation for failing to house enough veterans there. After settling a lawsuit in 2015 and agreeing to build 1,200 apartments, it is being sued again for falling far behind schedule.
Only about 10% of the veterans housed last year were placed on campus. Still, with placements rising in other apartments, the number of homeless veterans in the region fell last year by 23%, while the count among nonveterans rose 1%.

Some veterans dislike their buildings or neighborhoods. At 83, Iran Acton, was recently punched in the face and knocked down by another resident of a building filled with formerly homeless veterans. Although Acton calls his $350 rent a “godsend,” he added, “Some of the clientele that are allowed to move in, they’re not to my liking.”

“One guy was losing his bodily functions in the common areas,” said Sullivan, 68, who became homeless after his wife died and he could no longer afford their mobile home.

Japan Needs Foreign Workers. It's Just Not Sure They Should Stay.: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Foreign employees have become much more visible in Japan. But policies designed only for short-term stays may hurt the country in the global competition for labor.
Ngu Thazin wanted to leave her war-torn country for a better future. She set her sights on Japan.
In Myanmar, she studied Japanese and graduated with a chemistry degree from one of her country's most prestigious universities. Yet she gladly took a job in Japan changing diapers and bathing residents at a nursing home in a midsize city.
"To be honest, I want to live in Japan because it is safe," said Ms. Thazin, who hopes eventually to pass an exam that will allow her to work as a licensed caregiver. "And I want to send my family money."
Japan desperately needs people like Ms. Thazin to fill jobs left open by a declining and aging population. The number of foreign workers has quadrupled since 2007, to more than two million, in a country of 125 million people. Many of these workers escaped low wages, political repression or armed conflict in their home countries.
But even as foreign employees become much more visible in Japan, working as convenience store cashiers, hotel clerks and restaurant servers, they are treated with ambivalence. Politicians remain reluctant to create pathways for foreign workers, especially those in low-skill jobs, to stay indefinitely. That may eventually cost Japan in its competition with neighbors like South Korea and Taiwan, or even places farther afield like Australia and Europe, that are also scrambling to find labor.
The political resistance to immigration in long-insular Japan, as well as a public that is sometimes wary of integrating newcomers, has led to a nebulous legal and support system that makes it difficult for foreigners to put down roots. Foreign-born workers are paid on average about 30 percent less than their Japanese counterparts, according to government data. Fearful of losing their right to stay in Japan, workers often have precarious relationships with their employers, and career advancement can be elusive.
Japan's policies are designed for "people to work in Japan for preferably a short period of time," said Yang Liu, a fellow at the Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry in Tokyo. "If the system continues as it is, the probability that foreign workers will stop coming has become very high."
In 2018, the government passed a law authorizing a sharp increase in the number of low-skilled "guest laborers" allowed into the country. Earlier this year, the government committed to more than doubling the number of such workers over the next five years, to 820,000. It also revised a technical internship program that employers had used as a source of cheap labor and that workers and labor activists had criticized as fostering abuses.
Still, politicians are far from flinging open the country's borders. Japan has yet to experience the kind of significant migration that has convulsed Europe or the United States. The total number of foreign-born residents in Japan -- including nonworking spouses and children -- is 3.4 million, less than 3 percent of the population. The percentage in Germany and the United States, for instance, is close to five times that.
Japan has tightened some rules even as it has loosened others. This spring, the governing Liberal Democratic Party pushed through a revision to Japan's immigration law that would allow permanent residency to be revoked if a person fails to pay taxes. Critics warned that the policy could make it easier to withdraw residency status for more minor infractions, such as failing to show a police officer an identification card upon request.
Such a threat "robs permanent residents of their sense of security" and "will undoubtedly encourage discrimination and prejudice," Michihiro Ishibashi, a member of the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, said during a parliamentary discussion.
In a separate parliamentary committee, Ryuji Koizumi, the justice minister, said the revision was intended to "realize a society where we can coexist with foreigners," by making sure they "abide by the minimum rules necessary for living in Japan."
Long before foreigners can obtain permanent residency, they must navigate labyrinthine visa requirements, including language and skills tests. Unlike in Germany, where the government offers new foreign residents up to 400 hours of language courses at a subsidized rate of just over $ 2 per lesson, Japan has no organized language training for foreign workers.
While politicians say the country should do a better job of teaching Japanese, "they are not yet ready to go as far as pouring money into this from taxes," said Toshinori Kawaguchi, director of the foreign workers affairs division at the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.
That leaves individual municipalities and employers to decide whether and how often to provide language training. The nursing home operator that employs Ms. Thazin in Maebashi, the capital of Gunma Prefecture in central Japan, offers some of its caregivers one day of group Japanese lessons, as well as one more 45-minute lesson, each month. Workers who prepare meals receive just one 45-minute lesson a month.
Akira Higuchi, the president of the company, Hotaka Kai, said he gives workers an incentive to study Japanese on their own. Those who pass the second-highest level of a government Japanese language proficiency test, he said, "will be treated the same as Japanese people, with the same salary and bonuses."
Particularly outside the largest cities, foreigners who don't speak Japanese can struggle to communicate with local governments or schools. In health emergencies, few hospital workers will speak languages other than Japanese.
Hotaka Kai has taken other measures to support its staff, including housing newcomers in subsidized corporate apartments and offering skills training.
A dormitory kitchen shared by 33 women ranging in age from 18 to 31 offers a glimpse of the heritages that mingle together. Peeking out from plastic bins labeled with the residents' names were sachets of Ladaku merica bubuk (an Indonesian white pepper powder) and packets of thit kho seasoning for making Vietnamese braised pork with eggs.
Across Gunma Prefecture, the reliance on foreign workers is unmistakable. In Oigami Onsen, a rundown mountainside village where many restaurants, shops and hotels are shuttered, half of the 20 full-time workers at Ginshotei Awashima, a traditional Japanese hot springs inn, are originally from Myanmar, Nepal or Vietnam.
With the inn's deeply rural location, "there are no more Japanese people who want to work here," said Wataru Tsutani, the owner.
Several of its foreign workers have educational backgrounds that would seem to qualify them for more than menial work. A 32-year-old with a degree in physics from a university in Myanmar serves food in the inn's dining rooms. A 27-year-old who studied Japanese culture at a university in Vietnam is stationed at the reception desk. A 27-year-old Nepali who was studying agricultural history at a university in Ukraine before the Russian invasion now washes dishes and lays out futon, Japanese-style bedding, in guest rooms.
Most of the customers at Ginshotei Awashima are Japanese. Sakae Yoshizawa, 58, who had come for an overnight stay with her husband and was enjoying a cup of tea in the lobby before checking out, said she was impressed by the service. "Their Japanese is very good, and I have a good feeling about them," she said. Ms. Yoshizawa said she works with foreign-born colleagues at a newspaper delivery service.
Ngun Nei Par, the inn's general manager, graduated from a university in Myanmar with a degree in geography. She hopes that the Japanese government will smooth a path toward citizenship that would allow her to bring the rest of her family to Japan someday.
Mr. Tsutani, the owner, said that a public that had not caught up with reality might object if too many foreigners obtained citizenship.
"I hear a lot that Japan is a 'unique country,"' Mr. Tsutani said. Ultimately, "there is no need to make it that difficult" for foreigners to stay in Japan, he said. "We want workers."

MS-13 Killed Her Sister. That Was Just the Start Of Her Family's Grief.: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After Kelsey Cuevas lost her sister Kayla, a driver ran over their mother at the site of Kayla's memorial. The driver is set to be sentenced to probation.
The cycle of violence, retribution and attempts at justice transfixed Long Island for years.
On Sept. 14, 2016, the body of Kayla Cuevas was found, bludgeoned to death by members of MS-13 and left beside a house at 6 Ray Court in Brentwood.
Two years later exactly, her mother, Evelyn Rodriguez, who had become a renowned anti-gang activist, was run down on Ray Court by the homeowner's daughter. The daughter, Annmarie Drago, had grown weary of unceasing memorials near the property, prosecutors said.
The prosecution of Ms. Drago followed a byzantine nearly six-year path of conviction, reversal and retrial as attention seeped away and Ms. Rodriguez's family fell to pieces. On Tuesday, the case appears set to end in a Suffolk County courtroom, with Ms. Drago, 63, likely to receive no more jail time than the one week she already has served.
For Kelsey Cuevas, 26, Kayla's sister and the sole survivor of a tight triad of women, it has been a torturous ordeal with an unjust ending.
She has struggled to reassemble her life while raising two young children who will grow up without their aunt or grandmother. She lives on Long Island but refuses to say where, terrified that the gang will come after her. On some days, she still picks up the phone to call her mother, forgetting that she's gone.
"Being diagnosed with PTSD, I just feel like there's a part of me that's like just really loose," she said on a recent morning, taking a long drag from a spliff as she spoke.
Ms. Rodriguez's death has left Ms. Cuevas with a haunting feeling that her mother died fighting for justice but will be denied it herself.
"When does it end?" Ms. Cuevas said. "When can I sit here and grieve in peace?"
'A mother on a mission'
Brentwood, a predominantly Hispanic hamlet in Suffolk County, about 45 miles east of Manhattan, was a hot spot for MS-13, a transnational gang founded in the late 1980s by Salvadoran immigrants in California. By the time of Kayla Cuevas's death in September 2016, violence had gripped the town, including a spate of gruesome murders of teenagers.
Kayla, 16, had been feuding with gang members at school and on social media, prosecutors said. After going missing, she and a friend, Nisa Mickens, 15, were discovered next to the modest, slate blue house on Ray Court. The girls had been beaten to death with baseball bats and machetes.
Ms. Rodriguez, 50, harnessed the full force of her maternal grief and sprang into action. Morning after morning, she knocked on doors, searching for answers about Kayla's death. She haunted the Suffolk County Police Department.
"She was a mother on a mission," said Barbara Medina, an anti-gang activist. "I don't even think she mourned her daughter. I think she was just so focused on finding justice."
Ms. Rodriguez went to local and federal officials, and eventually, to then-President Donald J. Trump, who had seized on Kayla's case in his administration's crackdown on illegal immigration. She met with Mr. Trump during a visit to Long Island and attended the 2018 State of the Union address as his guest.
By the spring after Kayla was killed, gang members involved in her murder were arrested in a federal sweep. Across Brentwood, MS-13's activity was beginning to diminish, in part thanks to Ms. Rodriguez's advocacy, said Peter King, a former Republican congressman who helped facilitate a meeting with Mr. Trump.
"She was definitely the heroine of that movement," he said.
The sidewalk in front of 6 Ray Court had become the site of frequent memorials, the street cluttered with plush animals and flickering candles, large groups of mourners nursing alcoholic drinks. Again and again, detritus was strewed outside the house. Again and again, Ms. Drago had cleaned it up.
Ms. Drago's mother had grown weary of the gatherings and moved out, leaving her daughter to fix up the house and sell it, her lawyers said.
Death on a sunny day
It was brilliantly sunny on Sept. 14, 2018, the second anniversary of Kayla's death.
By the time Ms. Rodriguez and her partner, Freddy Cuevas, arrived at 6 Ray Court at about 4 p.m., the memorial she had set up hours earlier was gone, dismantled by Ms. Drago. The large floral wreath. The balloons. Even the photo board of Kayla, her slender face smiling from behind a junior R.O.T.C. uniform.
Ms. Drago was pulling out of the driveway with the mementos in her white Nissan Rogue. A local news crew captured the nightmarish moments that followed.
Ms. Rodriguez hovered beside the driver's side window, pointing furiously and demanding the items back. She took a quick step, and Ms. Drago hit the gas. Then the screams began. Ms. Drago had struck Ms. Rodriguez's foot with her front tire, pulling her to the pavement, and then she drove over her, prosecutors said. Ms. Rodriguez's skull was fractured.
Miles away, Ms. Cuevas was on her way to buy candles for the vigil when she noticed a torrent of police cars speeding down the highway. Ray Court was taped off. Ten minutes after Ms. Cuevas arrived at the hospital, Ms. Rodriguez was pronounced dead.
In November 2018, Timothy D. Sini, then the Suffolk County district attorney, announced an indictment of Ms. Drago on charges of criminally negligent homicide, the lowest level of felony, which carries a maximum sentence of four years.
In February 2020, Ms. Drago was tried in a courtroom packed with Brentwood residents. The video of the fatal accident was played over and over. Ms. Cuevas, who was pregnant, refused to leave the courtroom for days on end, even when her contractions started. She gave birth days later.
The jury convicted Ms. Drago, and in March 2021, she was sentenced to nine months behind bars. A week later, she was released on bail pending her appeal. The judge cited her lack of criminal history and post-traumatic stress disorder related to her job as a nurse in a psychiatric ward.
That appeal paid off 16 months later: A higher court overturned Ms. Drago's conviction and ordered a new trial on the grounds that a prosecutor had made improper comments and inflamed the jury's emotions during closing arguments. The prosecutor, it ruled, had made claims about Ms. Drago's conduct that went beyond the charges.
When Ms. Drago returned to court in 2023 to stand trial before a new judge and jury, her lawyer, Matthew Hereth, described Ms. Rodriguez's death in closing arguments as a "tragic accident, nothing more."
This time, the jury convicted Ms. Drago of misdemeanor larceny for taking items from the memorial. But they deadlocked on the homicide charge, forcing the judge to declare a mistrial on that accusation and leaving Ms. Cuevas, her family and Ms. Drago in excruciating limbo.
'The law don't do what it's supposed to do.'
Ms. Cuevas was bracing for still another trial, but that day never came.
In May, Ms. Drago pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide, admitting that she had hit the gas and fatally struck Ms. Rodriguez, according to court documents. Prosecutors asked in court for a sentence as long as three years, but Justice Richard Ambro said he would be likely to impose five years of probation.
Ms. Cuevas sees the outcome as a failure of a justice system that treats Hispanic families poorly: "The law don't do what it's supposed to do," Ms. Cuevas said, adding: "She got everything she wanted. And she's in no trouble."
The Suffolk County district attorney's office last month declined to comment on the case. "My office is committed to continue Ms. Rodriguez's fight," Raymond A. Tierney, Mr. Sini's successor, said in a statement after the plea.
Ms. Drago could not be reached by email or at numbers listed under her name. Her current lawyer, Mr. Hereth, declined to comment.
"She was just torn apart by this whole thing," said Stephen Kunken, Ms. Drago's previous lawyer.
No chance to mourn
On a morning in July, Ms. Cuevas stared out the window of her car. Tucked into the felted ceiling was a $ 20 bill on which someone had scrawled the name "Kayla" in pen -- a sign she took as good luck.
Ms. Cuevas had been 18 when her sister died, and she grew up fast after that, raising two children while contending with the dissolution of her own family.
Freddy Cuevas, Kelsey and Kayla's father, who had witnessed Ms. Rodriguez's death, suffered a stroke shortly after. The family no longer lives in the Brentwood home where Ms. Cuevas grew up; it fractured and dispersed, and she no longer speaks to her father.
The trials have forced her to relive -- and rewatch -- her mother's death in agonizing detail. "I feel like I haven't mourned my mom yet," she said.
Ms. Rodriguez had a way of soothing life's pains, Ms. Cuevas said. She could be hard on her in that way of mothers and daughters, always pushing her forward. She still looms large in her life, and Ms. Cuevas said she still tries to make her proud.
The house on Ray Court stands quiet, though it is painted beige now, and the driveway is full of unfamiliar cars. Sometimes, when she's in Brentwood, Ms. Cuevas drives by it, and the memories flood back.
"I have days when it feels like that day all over again," she said softly. "That's what makes it so hard."

Japan Needs Foreign Workers. It’s Just Not Sure It Wants Them to Stay.

MAEBASHI, Japan — Ngu Thazin wanted to leave her war-torn country for a better future. She set her sights on Japan.
In Myanmar, she studied Japanese and graduated with a chemistry degree from one of her country’s most prestigious universities. Yet she gladly took a job in Japan changing diapers and bathing residents at a nursing home in a midsize city.
“To be honest, I want to live in Japan because it is safe,” said Thazin, who hopes eventually to pass an exam that will allow her to work as a licensed caregiver. “And I want to send my family money.”
Japan desperately needs people like Thazin to fill jobs left open by a declining and aging population. The number of foreign workers has quadrupled since 2007, to more than 2 million, in a country of 125 million people. Many of these workers escaped low wages, political repression or armed conflict in their home countries.
But even as foreign employees become much more visible in Japan, working as convenience store cashiers, hotel clerks and restaurant servers, they are treated with ambivalence. Politicians remain reluctant to create pathways for foreign workers, especially those in low-skill jobs, to stay indefinitely. That may eventually cost Japan in its competition with neighbors such as South Korea and Taiwan, or even places farther afield including Australia and Europe, that are also scrambling to find labor.
Political resistance to immigration in long-insular Japan, as well as a public that is sometimes wary of integrating newcomers, has led to a nebulous legal and support system that makes it difficult for foreigners to put down roots. Foreign-born workers are paid on average about 30% less than their Japanese counterparts, according to government data. Fearful of losing their right to stay in Japan, workers often have precarious relationships with their employers, and career advancement can be elusive.
Japan’s policies are designed for “people to work in Japan for preferably a short period of time,” said Yang Liu, a fellow at the Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry in Tokyo. “If the system continues as it is, the probability that foreign workers will stop coming has become very high.”
In 2018, the government passed a law authorizing a sharp increase in the number of low-skilled “guest laborers” allowed into the country. This year, the government committed to more than doubling the number of such workers over the next five years, to 820,000. It also revised a technical internship program that employers had used as a source of cheap labor and that workers and labor activists had criticized as fostering abuses.
Still, politicians are far from flinging open the country’s borders. Japan has yet to experience the kind of significant migration that has convulsed Europe or the United States. The total number of foreign-born residents in Japan — including nonworking spouses and children — is 3.4 million, less than 3% of the population. The percentage in Germany and the United States, for instance, is close to five times that.
Japan has tightened some rules even as it has loosened others. This spring, the governing Liberal Democratic Party pushed through a revision to Japan’s immigration law that would allow permanent residency to be revoked if a person fails to pay taxes. Critics warned that the policy could make it easier to withdraw residency status for more minor infractions, such as failing to show a police officer an identification card upon request.

Japan's Grip On Car Trade In Thailand Is Loosening: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After dominating sales in Thailand for decades, Mazda, Nissan and other Japanese companies are losing their grip on a market long viewed as a regional hub.
Japanese companies established Thailand's auto industry virtually from scratch, dating back to the years after World War II. By the late 1970s, Japanese brands commanded around 90 percent of car sales in Thailand. They invested in building Thai supply chains, and their cars were also widely perceived by customers as reliable.
In the 1990s, American and South Korean automakers targeted the Thai market but barely made a dent in Japan's share.
Now Japanese automakers' stronghold is finally being loosened by Chinese manufacturers that offer something they don't: electric vehicles at affordable prices. The influx of Chinese brands like BYD, Great Wall Motor and SAIC Motor in the past two years is ringing alarms in Japan.
In December, Srettha Thavisin, Thailand's prime minister, traveled to Japan with a message for Japanese companies: Move quickly, invest in electric vehicles or lose out to China.
"You are not alone in the world," Mr. Thavisin warned Japan's automakers in an interview with Japanese media.
Japanese companies' unwillingness to fully embrace electric vehicles, which are popular in Thailand, has held them back in the Thai market. Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Suzuki and Isuzu have taken the heaviest blows, in part because of their limited lineups of plug-in hybrid or fully electric models. Last year, new car sales in Thailand for those companies collectively dropped 25 percent while overall sales fell 9 percent, according to data compiled by MarkLines, an automotive information provider.
This month, Honda announced it would cease vehicle production at one of its two factories in Thailand next year. And Suzuki said in June that it would close its only vehicle-manufacturing plant in the country.
Japanese manufacturers, which account for about 75 percent of vehicle sales in Thailand, are taking steps to stem the erosion of their position. During Mr. Thavisin's trip to Japan, Toyota, Honda, Isuzu and Mitsubishi said they would invest $ 4.3 billion over five years to convert their Thai factories to make electric vehicles. Late last year, Honda began producing electric vehicles in Thailand.
Nissan established Thailand's first Japanese auto assembly plant in Bangkok in 1962, a time when Thais bought only a few thousand vehicles a year. Toyota followed shortly after, starting vehicle production in Thailand in 1964.
From early on, the Japanese companies viewed Thailand as a regional export hub for Southeast Asia. They spent decades investing to develop Thai supply chains and sales networks, predominantly for pickup trucks that are exported and sold domestically. Japan's strategy paid off in the 1980s and 1990s in particular, when Japanese automakers cashed in on booming demand in Southeast Asia while the United States and Germany were largely focused on Eastern Europe.
Southeast Asia, including Thailand, stands as the largest market for Mitsubishi and other smaller Japanese automakers. In the fiscal year that ended in March, Mitsubishi's sales in the region fell 9 percent from the previous year.
Mitsubishi and other Japanese automakers are pinning hopes on developing new hybrid and electric models to regain lost ground. In February, Mitsubishi introduced a hybrid version of its Xpander multipurpose vehicle in Thailand, and the company said orders had surpassed expectations.
But the Chinese electric vehicle companies are formidable competition.
GAC Aion, the E.V. arm of the state-owned Guangzhou Automobile Group, has quickly established a manufacturing and sales business in Thailand and is trying to break into another Japanese stronghold: taxis. Toyota accounts for a vast majority of taxis on the road in Thailand.
Through a Thai partner, Gold Integrate, Aion has released a fully electric sedan dedicated solely for the country's ride-hailing and taxi market.
Over the past year, the Aion-Gold Integrate partnership has sold several thousand of a taxi-only model to commercial customers in Thailand for about $ 25,000 with a nine-year warranty.
Huang Yongjie, chairman of Gold Integrate, which also invested in 15 showrooms for Aion, said Toyota had responded to Aion's entry into the Thai market by cutting the price of its main taxi model by nearly $ 3,000. It was notable, Mr. Huang said, because "Toyota never cuts prices."

Chinese E.V. Makers Upend A Country's Auto Market: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: China's electric vehicle companies are making inroads in Thailand, a key industry hub, as Europe and the United States wield tariffs to keep them out.
Ma Haiyang and eight of his colleagues arrived in Thailand a year ago to establish the first overseas operation for GAC Aion, an electric vehicle maker from China. They had no office, no factory, no local employees and, basically, no clue.
The Aion team set up shop in a Bangkok hotel, commandeering conference rooms and holding meetings in the lobby. They had a long list of things to do: Find office space, recruit dealers and devise a business strategy. The team worked around the clock and, 74 days after arriving in Thailand, sold its first electric vehicle.
"The window of opportunity for Chinese new energy vehicles going overseas will be relatively short," said Mr. Ma, general manager at Aion for Southeast Asia, using China's preferred phrase for fully electric and gas-electric hybrid vehicles. "This is why we wanted to hurry up," he added.
Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers like Aion are stampeding into overseas markets. Thailand is one of the first countries to experience the sudden influx of China's automobile brands, and is confronting how their ambition and competitiveness are reshaping its car industry.
The arrival of China E.V. Inc. is evident everywhere in Thailand. Billboards are blanketed with advertisements for Chinese cars. Land prices are soaring because so many Chinese firms are building car factories.
The fast changes in the Thai auto market also show how Chinese companies are leaping ahead of their global rivals in Japan, which has shunned E.V.s, and the United States, where Tesla dominates the sector.
Last year, sales of popular Japanese brands such as Nissan, Mazda and Mitsubishi plummeted as consumers bought new electric cars from Chinese manufacturers instead. Dealers that had worked with Japanese and American automakers for decades were now turning over showrooms to make way for Chinese vehicles. Amid an increasingly crowded field, Chinese brands are slashing prices on electric vehicles.
The overseas push is the next phase in Beijing's long-term strategy to focus on new energy vehicles and upend the balance of power in the automobile industry.
After years of government support for the sector, Chinese manufacturers are adept at mass-producing electric vehicles. They have established dependable supply chains, while working out the kinks to reduce prices.
That international push has been met with tariffs in two major auto markets to prevent a glut of Chinese vehicles from crushing homegrown competitors. Last month, the European Union said it would impose tariffs of up to 38 percent on electric vehicles imported from China into the bloc. A month earlier, the United States quadrupled tariffs on E.V.s built in China.
Thailand is small by comparison, but it is the biggest market in Southeast Asia. Known as the "Detroit of Asia," it serves as a regional manufacturing hub. Its proximity and strong trade ties to China also allow Chinese cars to be imported quickly and inexpensively.
"It's a beachhead market," said Tu Le, a managing director of the consultancy Sino Auto Insights. "It suits a lot of Chinese brands because of the lower price point."
In a market once considered a Japanese stronghold, a changing of the guard is already happening. Japanese automobile brands accounted for 86 percent of new car sales in 2022. That figure dropped to 75 percent last year, with China's BYD, Great Wall Motor and SAIC Motor grabbing significant market share.
In 2021, Thailand said it wanted electric vehicles to account for 30 percent of its automobile production by the end of the decade, an ambitious goal that seems unattainable without Chinese companies. Its government also put in place subsidies and tax breaks to spur demand.
A weak Thai economy has contributed to a significant decline in overall car sales this year. Electric vehicle sales have slowed a lot but are still up 50 percent over last year. Chinese automakers have responded by cutting prices, leaving some competitors worried about a race to the bottom.
Chong Baoyu, general manager of Great Wall Motor in the Thailand unit, said an all-out price war would "kill the industry" because customers would hold off on buying a vehicle, expecting prices to fall further.
"The price cut is a short-term solution but not long-term," he said.
Four years ago, Great Wall Motor acquired General Motors' factories as part of a retreat by the American carmaker.
In May, with the European Union tariffs on China looming, Great Wall Motor announced that it would close its regional headquarters in Munich, citing an "increasingly challenging European electric vehicle market."
The company plans to continue operating in Europe, Mr. Chong said, but the prospect of tariffs makes Thailand an even more important market for Chinese brands.
Six Chinese electric vehicle companies are already selling cars in Thailand, and three more entrants are coming this year. BYD, Aion, Great Wall, Hozon Auto's Neta and Chery are among those that have opened or are building factories in Thailand.
"When the Chinese see an opportunity, they just go," Wirat Tatsaringkansakul, deputy secretary general of the Thailand Board of Investment, said at an automotive conference for Chinese suppliers last month.
Japan's dominance over Thailand's automotive industry dates to the 1960s when Nissan Motor and its local partner, Siam Motors, opened the country's first car factory. Japan's support helped establish the Phornprapha family, which owns the privately held Siam Motors, as the first family of Thailand's car industry.
But even within the Phornprapha family, alliances are shifting.
Pratarnwong Phornprapha and Pratarnporn Phornprapha, the grandchildren of Siam Motors' founder, control Rever Automotive, which is the exclusive distributor for BYD cars in Thailand. BYD, China's leading E.V. company, competes directly with Siam Motors' longtime partner, Nissan. BYD sold more cars in Thailand than Nissan did last year, even though the Chinese automaker had only three models available.
Pratarnwong Phornprapha, who is Rever's chief executive, and Pratarnporn Phornprapha, his sister and vice chief executive, said their company was completely separate from Siam Motors, which is run by their uncle and cousin. This month, BYD said it had acquired a 20 percent stake in Rever for an undisclosed sum.
In less than two years, Rever has opened 110 showrooms across the country, with the goal of another 50 by the end of 2024.
Pratarnwong Phornprapha, the Rever chief executive, said there had been no tension within the family, because Rever was focused on electric vehicles and Siam Motors made traditional cars.
"For now, I don't think there is any conflict," he said.
The Phornprapha siblings said one of the biggest challenges they faced was to assuage concerns about the reliability of Chinese automobiles -- especially because Japanese brands are held in high regard.
"I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a hurdle when we started," Mr. Phornprapha said. "Chinese products, 10 years ago, aren't what we see today."
V Group Cars, a dealer network with 44 showrooms, said a majority of its locations sold only Chinese brands. The dealer network stopped working with Suzuki. It converted Mazda, Mitsubishi and Ford Motor showrooms into sales locations for Aion, Neta, Chery's Omoda and Jaecoo brands, and Zeekr.
Aion, in its first year in Thailand, has opened 41 showrooms and started production at a new factory this month. It has announced plans to open a plant in Indonesia and start selling its cars in nine countries across Southeast Asia.
Last month, Phanthakan Wongsa and his wife bought an Aion Y Plus sport utility vehicle at a showroom in Bangkok. They own a gasoline-powered Suzuki but wanted an energy-efficient car. Mr. Wongsa, a 35-year-old engineer, paid around $ 25,000 after a government subsidy and a 20 percent price cut.
On a recent afternoon at an Aion showroom in the eastern part of Bangkok, the company was offering a $ 25,000 package for the Y Plus that included an eight-year warranty, installation of a home charger and 12 months of insurance.
V Group, the dealer network, had converted the showroom from a Mazda dealership last year. Mazda sales "plummeted in recent years," said Pananya Jira-alongkorn, vice president of V Group. Thai consumers were more interested in electric vehicles, she said, and Mazda had "none to offer."
Aion adapted its Chinese cars for the local market, turning up the power of the air-conditioning and strengthening the chassis for poor road conditions.
On his desk at Aion's offices in a Bangkok high-rise, Mr. Ma displayed a miniature model ship that captures the spirit of Chinese automakers prospecting for customers.
Written on the ship's sails is a Chinese phrase: "Ride the wind, cleave the waves and return with a full load."

SoftBank's Leader Pitches a New Path for Self-Driving Cars: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Masayoshi Son, the billionaire founder of SoftBank, is trying to rally automakers around the world to join forces on autonomous-driving technologies.
Masayoshi Son has long prided himself on his ability to detect big shifts in technology early on. During his four decades leading SoftBank, a free-spending Japanese investment group, the billionaire has made some spectacularly successful investments. And some epic flops.
In recent months, Mr. Son has been laying out plans for a new big bet: self-driving cars.
Befitting his maverick approach, Mr. Son's pitch does not resemble other efforts to develop autonomous vehicles. He is trying to convince automakers from around the world, rivals under most scenarios, to work together to use artificial intelligence to accelerate autonomous driving advances. That way, the thinking goes, they will be able to overcome the challenges that have led some to abandon self-driving car efforts.
In recent months, Mr. Son, 66, has summoned automotive executives to a tatami-mat-floored room at the top of a skyscraper in Tokyo Bay to discuss the idea, including the chief executives and autonomous-driving leaders of Honda Motor and Nissan Motor. He has also spoken with the chief executive of Uber.
Mr. Son's vision is to assemble a group of auto companies across the United States, Japan and Europe that would pool resources, including the vehicle-driving data crucial to autonomous-driving systems, according to five people briefed on his plans who were not authorized to speak publicly.
Most driverless car projects today rely on high-definition maps to help vehicles navigate, but these maps can become outdated, and vehicles are restricted to operating only in certain areas. Mr. Son is pitching a model in which cars can navigate -- potentially anywhere -- using a powerful A.I. computer system that would guide vehicles through everything they encounter on roads. That system would need to be trained using massive amounts of data.
Spokespeople for SoftBank, Honda, Nissan and Uber declined to comment.
SoftBank has a number of investments in A.I. and related industries, including a majority stake in the semiconductor design firm Arm. SoftBank would stand to benefit if technologies offered by the companies it has invested in were adopted by the autonomous vehicle coalition that Mr. Son hopes to assemble.
Mr. Son's overtures come as self-driving vehicle efforts have hit a bumpy period. The technologies for these cars are expensive, difficult to develop and face intense regulatory scrutiny. Some major companies have recently become more cautious about pouring cash into these projects.
Apple recently abandoned its self-driving car efforts after years of development. Cruise, the General Motors self-driving subsidiary, removed its driverless cars from the road last year amid safety and legal concerns, though it has since resumed limited testing. The previous year, Ford Motor said it was shutting down Argo AI, its autonomous-driving venture.
Analysts say that China, which is testing more driverless cars on public roads than any other country, and Tesla, which has promised to unveil a "robotaxi" this year, are far ahead of most traditional automakers in developing autonomous vehicles. Even if the established American, European and Japanese auto giants were to band together under direction from SoftBank, there would be no certainty that they could catch up.
At the same time, some in the industry think the boom around A.I. is reinvigorating the development of self-driving. This is where Mr. Son, who is leading a multibillion-dollar effort to reinvent SoftBank as an A.I. powerhouse, comes in.
Through the years, Mr. Son has built a name for himself as one of the world's most prolific and aggressive tech investors. Sensing the rise of e-commerce in China, Mr. Son invested $ 20 million in the internet company Alibaba in 2000. The investment ultimately became one of the most profitable in history, netting his company tens of billions of dollars. A less prescient bet on WeWork led to losses of more than $ 14 billion when the office-leasing company filed for bankruptcy late last year.
SoftBank has been on a tear recently, with its shares setting record highs thanks to better financial results from its investment unit and gains from its stake in Arm that, like other companies in the chip industry, has had its shares soar on enthusiasm for computing-heavy A.I. systems.
As of the end of March, Mr. Son had close to $ 40 billion of cash at SoftBank to back more rounds of the giant investments, emphatic pronouncements and whimsical, unicorn-stamped slide decks he is known for.
Last month, Mr. Son returned to the public spotlight for the first time in more than half a year -- a period he said he spent reflecting, at times tearfully, on how SoftBank could lead the A.I. revolution. (Last year, Mr. Son told a shareholder meeting that he "couldn't stop crying for days" at the thought of ending his career with investment losses.)
Speaking with a raspy voice at last month's shareholder meeting, Mr. Son said that after several nights of fitful sleep, "his head was clear," having rediscovered the purpose of his existence.
"SoftBank Group has done many things up until now. All of these were warming up for A.S.I.," Mr. Son said, referring to what he calls "artificial super intelligence," a form of A.I. that he defines as 10,000 times smarter than human intelligence. "Why was Masayoshi Son born?" he asked. "I was born to make A.S.I. a reality."
During the shareholder meeting, Mr. Son dropped few hints about his plans, but spoke frequently about autonomous driving.
Like many other proponents of self-driving technology, Mr. Son says the point is not simply to save people from the chore of driving, but to reduce the number of people who die in accidents. In this way, "A.S.I. will be capable of saving us from despair," he said at the shareholder meeting.
From a commercial perspective, several SoftBank-backed companies would most likely benefit from the alliance Mr. Son envisions.
Earlier this year, Mr. Son led a $ 1 billion investment in Wayve, a maker of A.I. systems for autonomous vehicles. Arm has also been trying to expand beyond the mobile processors it has long been known for and push deeper into the automotive business. The company recently unveiled a class of chip designs and other systems for self-driving cars.
Will Mr. Son's autonomous-vehicle dreams ever materialize? Two people close to Mr. Son cautioned that the billionaire was full of ideas, including about self-driving cars, and that many of those ideas do not end up being put into practice. Autonomous driving is also just one part of Mr. Son's broader plans for transforming society using A.I., they said.
Automotive executives approached by Mr. Son said they had lingering concerns about how much time and money A.I.-powered autonomous vehicles would take to develop, according to two people familiar with the executives' thinking. Any cooperation between carmakers would also have to take increasingly strict antitrust scrutiny into account.
But there is one part of Mr. Son's pitch that auto industry leaders find particularly convincing: They need to find a way to hasten autonomous-driving efforts so that they are not left in the dust by the likes of Tesla and carmakers from China.
During one meeting, according to a person with knowledge of the event, Mr. Son was asked how, as he saw it, rival auto companies could compete with one another in self-driving cars if they all drew data from the same pool. His response was simple: with speed.

Larry Light, 83, Who Oversaw 'I'm Lovin' It' Ad Campaign for McDonald's: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A branding expert, he deployed the "I'm lovin' it" campaign globally in 2003 to bring customers and sales back to the fast-food giant when it was in a slump.
Larry Light, a McDonald's executive who oversaw a worldwide marketing campaign in the early 2000s that was built around the slogan "I'm lovin' it," which revived that fast-food chain when it was in the doldrums, died on June 24 in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 83.
His daughter Laura Light said the cause was aspiration pneumonia, adding that Parkinson's disease was listed as a secondary cause.
When he was hired in 2002 as the global chief marketing officer of McDonald's, Mr. Light was a consultant who had built his expertise in branding over more than 20 years as an advertising executive.
At McDonald's, he found a corporate colossus that had lost its way with some consumers, especially young ones. Earnings were falling. The stock price was down. Its advertising was uninspired.
"We recognized that mass marketing of mass messages to masses of people via mass media was a mass mistake," Mr. Light wrote in 2020 in the online publication Branding Strategy Insider. "McDonald's had been managed as a mass-market, mass-media, mass-message brand. Our challenge was to lead a big brand, but not as a mass brand."
Mr. Light said he had wanted a marketing message that did not tell McDonald's customers what to think.
"Don't tell me I 'deserve a break today.' I know I do," he wrote, referring to an earlier successful ad campaign. Instead, he sought one that spoke in the voice of a consumer.
He invited 14 ad agencies in 10 major countries to compete to create a campaign that would travel across borders. After a four-month beauty contest, a German agency, Heye & Partner, part of DDB Worldwide, won the pageant with "I'm lovin' it," or "Ich liebe es."
The slogan became part of a global marketing plan targeted to remind customers why they loved McDonald's and how its food fit into their lives. Agencies around the world created commercials that appeared in more than 100 countries, all conforming to the "I'm lovin' it" theme.
"We didn't need the same advertising everywhere as long as they were conveying the same purpose," said Joan Kiddon, who began working with Mr. Light in 1976 and is the president of Arcature, the consulting firm he opened in 1989 and stepped down from to work at McDonald's.
At internal meetings before the campaign was unveiled in September 2003, Mr. Light said, "everyone applauds." But, he told the Knight-Ridder News Service, some of the same people told him over cocktails, "Larry, this better work." Some franchisees reminded him that his time could be short if the campaign failed.
In the United States, Justin Timberlake starred in a commercial with teenagers surfing and skateboarding to a hip-hop beat and recorded a separate song, "I'm Lovin' It," with an accompanying video. Stars in other countries played similar roles in ads. The company also hired the skateboarder Tony Hawk to reach young people. The now familiar earworm, the five-tone jingle "ba-da-ba-ba-ba," was introduced in the ads.
Sales rebounded. In the first three months of 2004, McDonald's outlets around the world attracted 2.3 million more customers daily than in the same period the year before.
The Wall Street Journal called "I'm lovin' it" one of the top ad campaigns of 2003.
"Its most recent work, using the 'Smile' slogan, made consumers grimace," The Journal wrote. "But the new one has the makings of a hit."
In a speech to Advertising Age in June 2004, Mr. Light said, "'I'm lovin' it' is not a mere advertising slogan; it's an expression of our new brand attitude. In less than one year, people's attitudes changed from giving us the cold shoulder to becoming suddenly cool."
The turnaround at McDonald's included menu changes, like adding salads and removing "supersize" portions, and the founding of World Children's Day, which raises money for children's charities.
Marvin Lawrence Light was born on June 12, 1941, in Montreal. His father, Louis, was a confectionary manufacturer and a builder of residential homes; his mother, Celia (Sheinman) Light, oversaw the household.
After earning a bachelor's degree from McGill University in 1962, Mr. Light received a Ph.D. in psychology three years later from Ohio State University.
He was hired by BBDO Advertising, where, over 15 years, he rose to executive vice president. He became known for his knowledge and innovative use of market research, including studies that used focus groups and surveys to help companies understand the problems consumers had with their products and to find solutions.
H&R Block, for example, improved on its services by addressing 17 problems identified by consumers about tax preparation in general and the company's methods in particular, Ms. Kiddon said.
In 1981, Mr. Light moved to another agency, Ted Bates Worldwide, as an executive vice president and oversaw the advertising for the M&M/Mars candy account. Five years later, he became chairman and chief executive of Bates's overseas division.
In 1989, two years after Bates's merger with Backer & Spielvogel -- both were subsidiaries of Saatchi & Saatchi -- Mr. Light started Arcature with Don Zuckert, a former Bates executive. Mr. Zuckert left in 1995.
Mr. Light spent the next 35 years at Arcature, advising companies like IBM, Intel, Quaker Oats, Chipotle, Nissan and Visa. McDonald's was his client when he joined the company.
Jim Kirk, a marketing columnist, wrote in 2002 in The Chicago Tribune that McDonald's was taking a risk by not hiring a "corporate heavyweight with practical hands-on experience."
But Jack M. Greenberg, McDonald's chairman and chief executive at the time, said in a statement that in Mr. Light "we have selected one of the world's best thought leaders in brand strategy."
Mr. Light left McDonald's in 2005 and returned to Arcature. He left the firm again in 2012 to take another corporate job, as the chief brands officer of IHG Hotels & Resorts, a post he held until 2014. He had previously consulted for the company.
In addition to his daughter Laura, Mr. Light is survived by his wife, Joyce (Wax) Light; another daughter, Michelle Light; his brothers Irwin and Bruce; and two grandchildren.
He and Ms. Kiddon collaborated on four books, three of them on branding, including "Six Rules of Brand Revitalization" (2009).

Full text: As the serene Hamptons village is overrun with news vans, the locals eat oysters and engage in some light media criticism.
On Tuesday afternoon in Sag Harbor, Janice Yu of WABC-TV was sitting in the passenger seat of a Nissan news van, eating from a bag of Smart Food popcorn. It was as close as she would come to getting to a kernel of news.
"We don't even know who he was with," she said, referring to the singer and actor Justin Timberlake, who had been arrested by a Sag Harbor police officer shortly after midnight on Tuesday and charged with driving while intoxicated.
Ms. Yu, a reporter for ABC7 Eyewitness News in New York, was one of many journalists parked along Main Street near the American Hotel, a 19th-century inn where waiters serve Gardiners Bay littleneck clams and Long Island duckling confit to boomer stock sultans. It was also where Mr. Timberlake had been partying with friends the night before.
Now it was a muggy and sunny day on the leafy street of this quaint-by-Hamptons-standards onetime whaling village, lined by shops that sell everything from $ 30 Havaianas flip-flops to $ 4,600 swivel chairs by Charlotte Perriand. People in Lululemon activewear strolled by, clutching açaí bowls and iced drinks.
Ms. Yu, who joined the local news team in 2022 after a stint at Fox5 in Atlanta, had on a turquoise and green J. Crew dress. John Sprei, her field producer, was seated behind her in the van, wearing shorts and a T-shirt.
They had scored a copy of the arrest report that was filed in Sag Harbor Village Justice Court earlier that day -- but so had the journalists in other vehicles lining the block, a convoy that included news trucks and vans from CBS, NBC, PIX11, Entertainment Tonight, The Associated Press and CNN.
The police report stated that Mr. Timberlake was driving a gray 2025 BMW after spending some time at the American Hotel. It also said that he hadn't made it more than a few blocks before he drove through a stop sign on the corner of Madison Street and Jermain, a tree-lined block where the houses do not look like mansions.
He refused to take a breath test three times. "I had one martini and followed my friends home," he told the arresting officer, according to the report. Mr. Timberlake "performed poorly" in various field sobriety tests, the report said.
He was arrested and taken to the police station, right behind the American Hotel, on Division Street. There, he handed over his wedding ring, his phone, his baseball cap, his watch, his wallet, a vape pen, and green and blue papers, the sort used for rolling marijuana, according to the police report. (In 2011, the singer told Playboy that he liked cannabis because it helps him to "stop thinking.")
A number of news crews soon descended on Sag Harbor. At roughly 9:30 a.m., nearly nine hours after he was taken into police custody, Mr. Timberlake left the station in handcuffs. Tabloid photographers captured him looking glum after his overnight stay. He headed toward the Sag Harbor Village Justice Court on Main Street, less than 500 feet from the American Hotel, for his arraignment.
He had enlisted Edward D. Burke Jr., a former Suffolk County prosecutor who has set up shop in a small office across from the American Hotel and made himself into the Hamptons' go-to criminal defense lawyer. Mr. Timberlake, who is scheduled to play two shows at Madison Square Garden next week, pleaded not guilty to driving while intoxicated. A court date has been set for July 26.
As Ms. Yu filmed her last segment for the day, a CNN reporter stood outside the police station, which had closed at 4 p.m.
"I need the mug shot," he yelled out to an officer in a nearby patrol car.
"You got to call media relations," the officer yelled back.
Although the camera crews gave the American Hotel the appearance of a crime scene, all of its outdoor tables were occupied.
"It's not bothersome," said Theresa D'Andria, a Southampton resident who was there slurping up oysters with her husband. "The weather's great."
A few tables away, Stuart Levine, the former chief executive of Dale Carnegie & Associates, split $ 45 crab cakes with his wife, Harriet Levine.
"You won't be getting your Pulitzer Prize for this," he said to a reporter.
He added that he did not want to sound self-righteous (in fact, he didn't) but he felt that the level of news coverage seemed a little over the top, given that Mr. Timberlake had not gotten into an accident.
"It's like a happening," he said.
Walking down the street, Vanessa Gordon, a Hamptons resident, approached the WABC-TV news van with her 6-year-old son, Ben Gordon. He was dressed in the fight-wear he had worn for his jujitsu class at Epic Martial Arts on Main Street.
Ms. Gordon asked Mr. Sprei and Ms. Yu if her son could hold the microphone and pretend to deliver a news dispatch. Mr. Sprei told him to come on up, so he did.
Andrew and Lauren Finkelstein, parents to one of Ben's jujitsu buddies, approached soon after and asked if their son Max could join in the fun.
"We should charge admission," Mr. Sprei said.
As Max Finkelstein, 6, clutched the mic, his father asked him what he wanted to report on. He didn't seem to have an answer, so his father gave him a headline, inspired by one of Mr. Timberlake's hits.
"Cry me a river!" Mr. Finkelstein called out.

As Electric Vehicles Get Cheaper, Buyers Are No Longer Just Elites: [National Desk]

Full text: More efficient manufacturing, falling battery costs and intense competition are lowering sticker prices for battery-powered models to within striking distance of gasoline cars.
Alex Lawrence, a dealer in Salt Lake City who specializes in used electric cars, has seen a change over the last year in the kinds of customers who are coming into his showroom. They used to be well-heeled professionals who could drop $ 70,000 on a Rivian luxury pickup truck.
Recently, Mr. Lawrence said, customers have been snapping up used Teslas for a little over $ 20,000, after applying a $ 4,000 federal tax credit.
"We're seeing younger people," Mr. Lawrence said. "We are seeing more blue-collar and entry-level white-collar people. The purchase price of the car has suddenly become in reach."
Regarded by conservative politicians and other critics as playthings of the liberal elite, electric vehicles are fast becoming more accessible. Prices are falling because of increased competition, lower raw-material costs and more efficient manufacturing. Federal tax credits of up to $ 7,500 for new electric cars, often augmented by thousands of dollars in state incentives, push prices even lower.
At the same time, technology is improving quickly and making electric vehicles more practical. Cars that can travel more than 300 miles on a fully charged battery are becoming common, and charging times are dropping below 30 minutes. The number of fast chargers, which can top up a battery in less than half an hour, grew 36 percent from April 2023 to April 2024.
Carmakers including Tesla, Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the owner of Jeep, have announced plans for electric vehicles that would sell new for as little as $ 25,000.
"The E.V. market has hit an inflection point," said Randy Parker, chief executive of Hyundai Motor America, which will begin producing electric vehicles at a factory in Georgia by the end of the year. "The early adopters have come. They've got their cars. Now you're starting to see us transition to a mass market."
All this is good news for proponents of electric vehicles and the Biden administration, which is aiming for half of new cars sold to be electric by 2030 as part of the president's plan to combat climate change. Even if Republicans gain control of the White House and Congress and follow through on promises to dismantle electric vehicle subsidies, they may not be able to undo the market forces pushing down prices.
"There may be some hiccups in the exact pace and scale of E.V. sales if there are major policy changes, but I wouldn't expect the E.V. market to flatline," said Peter Slowik, who leads research on passenger cars at the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research organization. "Most automakers are committed to an all-electric future, and many are planning on a timeline that goes far beyond the next administration."
Electric cars, sales of which have slowed in recent months, are still more expensive than gasoline models, costing an average of $ 55,252 in the United States in April, according to estimates by Kelley Blue Book. That is a decline of 9 percent from April 2023, but still about $ 6,700 more than the average for all vehicles.
But Mr. Slowik's group estimates that cars and sport-utility vehicles capable of traveling 400 miles on a full battery will cost less than cars with internal combustion engines in 2030, even before taking into account government subsidies. (Pickup trucks, which require bigger batteries, will take a little longer, not reaching parity for 400-mile models until 2033.)
Those calculations do not take into account lower fuel and maintenance costs that strengthen the financial argument for electric vehicles. Electricity is almost always cheaper per mile than gasoline, and battery-powered vehicles don't need oil changes, engine air filters or spark plugs. For people who drive a lot, electric cars may already be a better deal. At the same time, some automakers are offering strong discounts on E.V. models as an enticement for buyers.
While prices are clearly trending downward, there are risks. China supplies more than half of the lithium-ion batteries used in cars sold in the United States, according to Interact Analysis, a research firm. Those batteries will become more expensive because the Biden administration announced in May that it would raise tariffs on them to 25 percent from 7.5 percent.
Many companies are building battery factories in the United States and Canada, but most of these won't produce enough batteries to replace China for several years.
Raw materials are another risk. The price of lithium and other materials required for batteries has plunged in the last 12 months, making electric cars cheaper. But commodity prices could soar again.
The recent slowdown in the growth of electric car sales has prompted Tesla, Ford and others to delay plans to expand manufacturing. But many analysts expect sales to pick up as a glut of models pushes down prices, and as the charging network grows. High prices and the fear of not being able to find a place to recharge are the two biggest reasons people hesitate to buy an electric vehicle, surveys show.
For many people, the car's price is not the only expense to consider. People who live in apartments often depend on public charging plugs. Public charging, besides being less convenient, tends to be more costly than charging at home.
Still, the forces pushing prices down are powerful. Manufacturing costs are dropping as traditional carmakers, who were slow to sell electric vehicles, start to apply their decades of experience with mass production to the new technology.
Later this year, for example, General Motors will begin selling an electric version of its Chevrolet Equinox sport-utility vehicle that will have a range of more than 300 miles and sell for less than $ 30,000 after the $ 7,500 federal tax credit. And the company plans to sell an even cheaper car, a new Chevrolet Bolt, next year.
The Equinox and Bolt will be built on G.M.'s Ultium platform, a collection of components that can be used for a variety of vehicles including pickups and luxury Cadillacs. G.M., which has cut costs by using the same batteries and parts for different models, has said its electric vehicles will become profitable in the second half of this year.
Electric cars still cost more to manufacture than cars with internal combustion engines, said Prateek Biswas, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, a research firm. But costs will come down as companies learn how to produce the cars more efficiently, Mr. Biswas said -- for example, by eliminating rare minerals from electric motors or replacing copper wiring with aluminum.
At the same time, the cost to make a gasoline car is rising because of stricter emissions regulations. "At some point it will be easier to just move toward E.V.s," Mr. Biswas said.
Competition is also intensifying. Toyota and other Japanese carmakers with a reputation for delivering reliable and affordable vehicles are belatedly offering electric vehicles. Honda plans to begin producing them at an Ohio factory next year.
There will be more than 100 fully electric models for sale in the United States by next year, according to Cars.com, an online sales platform, double the number available last year. "We're at the point now where anybody that wants an E.V. for a price point can actually get an E.V.," said Rebecca Lindland, senior director of industry data at Cars Commerce, which operates Cars.com.
Used car prices are arguably more important than prices of new cars. Most people buy used cars. A vibrant used market vastly increases the number of people who can consider an electric vehicle.
Models from Tesla, Nissan or G.M. have been on the road for three years or more, generating inventory for dealers as the original owners buy new ones. More than half of the used electric vehicles on the market sell for less than $ 30,000, according to Recurrent, a research firm that focuses on the used E.V. market.
Jesse Lore, owner of Green Wave Electric Vehicles in North Hampton, N.H., recently sold a used Chevy Bolt for $ 15,000. After applying a federal tax credit for used electric vehicles, the price was $ 11,000. Besides the lure of affordable prices, he noted, his customers like that electric vehicles are quieter than gasoline models, better for the environment, and faster because an electric motor generates instant torque.
"The car is more fun than whatever they're driving now," Mr. Lore said.

Auto Deals Are Making A Comeback: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Automakers and dealers are starting to offer discounts, low-interest loans and other incentives to lure buyers as the supply of cars grows.
For much of the last four years, automakers and their dealers had so few cars to sell -- and demand was so strong -- that they could command high prices. Those days are over, and hefty discounts are starting a comeback.
During the coronavirus pandemic, auto production was slowed first by factory closings and then by a global shortage of computer chips and other parts that lasted for years.
With few vehicles in showrooms, automakers and dealers were able to scrap most sales incentives, leaving consumers to pay full price. Some dealers added thousands of dollars to the manufacturer's suggested retail price, and people started buying and flipping in-demand cars for a profit.
But with chip supplies back to healthy levels, auto production has rebounded and dealer inventories are growing. At the same time, higher interest rates have dampened demand for vehicles. As a result, many automakers are scrambling to keep sales rolling.
Wes Lutz, owner of Extreme Dodge in Jackson, Mich., said he had several Dodge Challengers and Chargers that were eligible for $ 11,000 discounts from Stellantis, the manufacturer of Dodge, Chrysler, Jeep and Ram models. The automaker is also offering discounts of up to $ 3,600 on certain versions of the Dodge Durango sport utility vehicle.
"It seems like we may be headed back toward incentives and overproduction," Mr. Lutz said. "It's not there yet, but it's getting close."
With a shrug, he added, "It may not be good for me or for the manufacturer, but it's sure good for the consumer."
Cash-back offers, subsidized loans and other incentives are important tools for selling cars. They allow automakers and dealers to offer monthly payments that are more affordable for consumers and ease the impact of high interest rates.
In the last few years, shortages and consumers' preferences for large vehicle have pushed the average purchase price of new vehicles to just under $ 47,000, and the average monthly payment to $ 735, according to Edmunds, a market researcher. The average interest rate on used car loans was 11.6 percent in April, according to Edmunds.
At those levels, many consumers can no longer afford cars without substantial incentives.
But when taken to extremes, incentives can erode automakers' profits and create a surge of sales that inevitably gives way to a painful drop. Repeated waves of discounting also condition consumers to purchase cars only when offered a deal.
Two decades ago, the industry went on an incentive binge. General Motors for a time sold cars at the heavily discounted prices it previously offered only to its employees. Extreme discounting helped weaken G.M. and Chrysler before they filed for bankruptcy in 2009 during the financial crisis.
For now, the industry has avoided that trap. At the end of May, automakers had almost 2.9 million cars and light trucks in stock, about one million more than at the same time last year, according to Cox Automotive, a market researcher. Nearly 7 percent of those vehicles were 2023 models. By comparison, there were 4.1 million vehicles in stock in 2019, according to Automotive News.
Toyota, Honda, Subaru, and G.M.'s Chevrolet and Cadillac brands have kept tight reins on their inventories and in general have not yet elevated incentives significantly.
But Ford, Lincoln, Dodge, Chrysler, Nissan, Volvo and several other brands have higher stocks -- enough to last more than 100 days at the current rate of sales. They're offering some big incentives, but mostly targeted at specific models, and sometimes specific versions of certain models.
Ford, for example, is offering $ 5,500 off its Escape S.U.V., but only on the 2023 models that remain in dealer stock. Stellantis is offering $ 4,000 cash back on the Ram pickup, but it is limited to the 1500 Classic version. Volkswagen is offering interest-free financing on the 2024 Taos small S.U.V., but not on its other models.
"So far we're not seeing the across-the-board incentives that we had in the past," said Charles Chesbrough, a senior economist at Cox Automotive.
The growing number of incentives on new vehicles has helped pull down prices of used cars and trucks. In April, used car prices declined nearly 7 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Among the most heavily discounted models at the moment are electric vehicles, sales of which have slowed in recent months. Consumers' enthusiasm for those models has ebbed, mainly over concerns about the higher prices of electric vehicles and the challenges of keeping them charged, especially on road trips.
Now automakers are offering generous incentives to entice consumers. Volkswagen is offering discounts of up to $ 18,750 on leases on the 2023 ID.4, which is still readily available in some places. That includes the $ 7,500 federal tax credit, which can be rolled into leasing deals under the Inflation Reduction Act.
Other considerable deals are available on the Chevrolet Blazer electric vehicle, the Cadillac Lyriq, the Kia EV6, the Volvo XC40 Recharge hybrid and the Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickup. Tesla, which regularly raised prices during the pandemic, has spent the last year and a half slashing them. Recently the company has been offering 0.99 percent loans on its Model Y S.U.V.
The incentives come on top of other trends that are helping reduce the price of electric vehicles, including falling manufacturing costs and rising competition.
Increased discounting is helping tempt what are known in the industry as "want buyers" -- consumers who don't need a new car but are drawn by new technologies, design or features.
"You have your 'need buyer,' whose car had died or needs a lot of expensive repairs, and they have to get a new vehicle," said Adam Silverleib, owner of a Honda and a Volkswagen dealerships outside Boston. "But a lot of those 'want buyers' went away when interest rates went up, and now incentives are bringing some of them back."
Among them is Brian Pawlowski, a digital marketing executive in Chelsea, Mich. He had been driving a 2017 Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid that had only 55,000 miles on the odometer. But he was itching to get a fully electric model.
"I'm a person who likes the environment," he said. "I could have kept the Volt, but I wanted to upgrade to newer technology."
He began looking for deals on electric cars and found a two-year lease on a Hyundai Ioniq 5 S.U.V. The deal came with a $ 13,000 discount and other terms that left him with a monthly payment of $ 369 for a vehicle with a sticker price of $ 52,000.
"When the sales guy laid it all out," Mr. Pawlowski said, "it was pretty hard to pass up."

(Pickup trucks, which require bigger batteries, will take a little longer, not reaching parity for 400-mile models until 2033.)
Those calculations do not take into account lower fuel and maintenance costs that strengthen the financial argument for EVs. Electricity is almost always cheaper per mile than gasoline, and battery-powered vehicles don’t need oil changes, engine air filters or spark plugs. For people who drive a lot, EVs may already be a better deal. At the same time, some automakers are offering strong discounts on EV models as an enticement for buyers.
Although prices are clearly trending downward, there are risks. China supplies more than half of the lithium-ion batteries used in cars sold in the United States, according to Interact Analysis, a research firm. Those batteries will become more expensive because the Biden administration announced in May that it would raise tariffs on them to 25% from 7.5%.
Many companies are building battery factories in the United States and Canada, but most of these won’t produce enough batteries to replace China for several years.
Raw materials are another risk. The price of lithium and other materials required for batteries has plunged in the past 12 months, making EVs cheaper. But commodity prices could soar again.
The recent slowdown in the growth of EV sales has prompted Tesla, Ford and others to delay plans to expand manufacturing. But many analysts expect sales to pick up as a glut of models pushes down prices and as the charging network grows. High prices and the fear of not being able to find a place to recharge are the two biggest reasons people hesitate to buy an EV, surveys show.
For many people, the car’s price is not the only expense to consider. People who live in apartments often depend on public charging plugs. Public charging, besides being less convenient, tends to be more costly than charging at home.
Still, the forces pushing prices down are powerful. Manufacturing costs are dropping as traditional carmakers, who were slow to sell EVs, start to apply their decades of experience with mass production to the new technology.
Later this year, for example, General Motors will begin selling an electric version of its Chevrolet Equinox SUV that will have a range of more than 300 miles and sell for less than $30,000 after the $7,500 federal tax credit. And the company plans to sell an even cheaper car, a new Chevrolet Bolt, next year.
The Equinox and Bolt will be built on GM’s Ultium platform, a collection of components that can be used for a variety of vehicles including pickups and luxury Cadillacs. GM, which has cut costs by using the same batteries and parts for different models, has said its EVs will become profitable in the second half of this year.
EVs still cost about 10% more to manufacture than cars with internal combustion engines, said Prateek Biswas, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, a research firm. But costs will come down as companies learn how to produce the cars more efficiently, Biswas said — for example, by eliminating rare minerals from electric motors or replacing copper wiring with aluminum.
At the same time, the cost to make a gasoline car is rising because of stricter emissions regulations. “At some point it will be easier to just move toward EVs,” Biswas said.
Competition is also intensifying. Toyota and other Japanese carmakers with a reputation for delivering reliable and affordable vehicles are belatedly offering EVs. Honda plans to begin producing them at an Ohio factory next year.
There will be more than 100 fully electric models for sale in the United States by next year, according to Cars.com, an online sales platform, double the number available last year. “We’re at the point now where anybody that wants an EV for a price point can actually get an EV,” said Rebecca Lindland, senior director of industry data at Cars Commerce, which operates Cars.com.
Used-car prices are arguably more important than prices of new cars. Most people buy used cars. A vibrant used market vastly increases the number of people who can consider an EV.
Models from Tesla, Nissan or GM have been on the road for three years or more, generating inventory for dealers as the original owners buy new ones. More than half of the used EVs on the market sell for less than $30,000, according to Recurrent, a research firm that focuses on the used EV market.
Jesse Lore, owner of Green Wave Electric Vehicles in North Hampton, New Hampshire, recently sold a used Chevy Bolt for $15,000. After applying a federal tax credit for used EVs, the price was $11,000. Besides the lure of affordable prices, he noted, his customers like that electric vehicles are quieter than gasoline models, better for the environment and faster because an electric motor generates instant torque.
“The car is more fun than whatever they’re driving now,” Lore said.

Car Deals Vanished During the Pandemic. They’re Coming Back.

For much of the past four years, automakers and their dealers had so few cars to sell — and demand was so strong — that they could command high prices. Those days are over, and hefty discounts are starting a comeback.
During the coronavirus pandemic, auto production was slowed first by factory closings and then by a global shortage of computer chips and other parts that lasted for years.
With few vehicles in showrooms, automakers and dealers were able to scrap most sales incentives, leaving consumers to pay full price. Some dealers added thousands of dollars to the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, and people started buying and flipping in-demand cars for a profit.
But with chip supplies back to healthy levels, auto production has rebounded and dealer inventories are growing. At the same time, higher interest rates have dampened demand for vehicles. As a result, many automakers are scrambling to keep sales rolling.
Wes Lutz, owner of Extreme Dodge in Jackson, Michigan, said he had several Dodge Challengers and Chargers that were eligible for $11,000 discounts from Stellantis, the manufacturer of Dodge, Chrysler, Jeep and Ram models. The automaker is also offering discounts of up to $3,600 on certain versions of the Dodge Durango SUV.
“It seems like we may be headed back toward incentives and overproduction,” Lutz said. “It’s not there yet, but it’s getting close.”
With a shrug, he added, “It may not be good for me or for the manufacturer, but it’s sure good for the consumer.”
Cash-back offers, subsidized loans and other incentives are important tools for selling cars. They allow automakers and dealers to offer monthly payments that are more affordable for consumers and ease the impact of high interest rates.
In the past few years, shortages and consumers’ preferences for large vehicles have pushed the average purchase price of new vehicles to just under $47,000, and the average monthly payment to $735, according to Edmunds, a market researcher. The average interest rate on used-car loans was 11.6% in April, according to Edmunds.
At those levels, many consumers can no longer afford cars without substantial incentives.
But when taken to extremes, incentives can erode automakers’ profits and create a surge of sales that inevitably gives way to a painful drop. Repeated waves of discounting also condition consumers to purchase cars only when offered a deal.
Two decades ago, the industry went on an incentive binge. General Motors for a time sold cars at the heavily discounted prices it previously offered only to its employees. Extreme discounting helped weaken GM and Chrysler before they filed for bankruptcy in 2009 during the financial crisis.
For now, the industry has avoided that trap. At the end of May, automakers had almost 2.9 million cars and light trucks in stock, about 1 million more than at the same time last year, according to Cox Automotive, a market researcher. Nearly 7% of those vehicles were 2023 models. By comparison, there were 4.1 million vehicles in stock in 2019, according to Automotive News.
Toyota, Honda, Subaru, and GM’s Chevrolet and Cadillac brands have kept tight reins on their inventories and in general have not yet elevated incentives significantly.
But Ford, Lincoln, Dodge, Chrysler, Nissan, Volvo and several other brands have higher stocks — enough to last more than 100 days at the current rate of sales. They’re offering some big incentives, but mostly targeted at specific models, and sometimes specific versions of certain models.
Ford, for example, is offering $5,500 off its Escape SUV, but only on the 2023 models that remain in dealer stock. Stellantis is offering $4,000 cash back on the Ram pickup, but it is limited to the 1500 Classic version. Volkswagen is offering interest-free financing on the 2024 Taos small SUV, but not on its other models.
“So far, we’re not seeing the across-the-board incentives that we had in the past,” said Charles Chesbrough, a senior economist at Cox Automotive.
The growing number of incentives on new vehicles has helped pull down prices of used cars and trucks. In April, used-car prices declined nearly 7%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Among the most heavily discounted models at the moment are electric vehicles, sales of which have slowed in recent months. Consumers’ enthusiasm for those models has ebbed, mainly over concerns about the higher prices of EVs and the challenges of keeping them charged, especially on road trips.
Now, automakers are offering generous incentives to entice consumers. Volkswagen is offering discounts of up to $18,750 on leases on the 2023 ID.4, which is still readily available in some places. That includes the $7,500 federal tax credit, which can be rolled into leasing deals under the Inflation Reduction Act.
Other considerable deals are available on the Chevrolet Blazer EV, the Cadillac Lyriq, the Kia EV6, the Volvo XC40 Recharge hybrid and the Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickup. Tesla, which regularly raised prices during the pandemic, has spent the past year and a half slashing them. Recently, the company has been offering 0.99% loans on its Model Y SUV.
The incentives come on top of other trends that are helping reduce the price of EVs, including falling manufacturing costs and rising competition.
Increased discounting is helping tempt what are known in the industry as “want buyers” — consumers who don’t need a new car but are drawn by new technologies, design or features.
“You have your ‘need buyer,’ whose car had died or needs a lot of expensive repairs, and they have to get a new vehicle,” said Adam Silverleib, owner of a Honda dealership and a Volkswagen dealership outside of Boston. “But a lot of those ‘want buyers’ went away when interest rates went up, and now incentives are bringing some of them back.”
Among them is Brian Pawlowski, a digital marketing executive in Chelsea, Michigan. He had been driving a 2017 Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid that had only 55,000 miles on the odometer. But he was itching to get a fully electric model.
“I’m a person who likes the environment,” he said. “I could have kept the Volt, but I wanted to upgrade to newer technology.”
He began looking for deals on EVs and found a two-year lease on a Hyundai Ioniq 5 SUV. The deal came with a $13,000 discount and other terms that left him with a monthly payment of $369 for a vehicle with a sticker price of $52,000.
“When the sales guy laid it all out,” Pawlowski said, “it was pretty hard to pass up.”

Nissan Urges Caution
Over Its Older Vehicles
Nissan is urging the owners of about 84,000 older vehicles to stop driving them because their Takata airbag inflaters have an increased risk of exploding in a crash and hurling dangerous metal fragments.
Wednesday's request comes after one person in a Nissan was killed by an exploding front-passenger inflater, and as many as 58 people were injured since 2015.
"Due to the age of the vehicles equipped with defective Takata airbag inflaters, there is an increased risk the inflater could explode during an airbag deployment, propelling sharp metal fragments which can cause serious injury or death," Nissan said.
Nissan said the "do not drive" warning covers certain 2002 through 2006 Sentra small cars, as well as some 2002 through 2004 Pathfinder SUVs, and 2002 and 2003 Infiniti QX4 SUVs.
Nissan originally recalled 736,422 of the vehicles in 2020. Associated Press
MINING
BHP Halts Plan to Buy
Rival Anglo American
The mining giant BHP Group walked away on Wednesday from its $ 49 billion plan to take over rival Anglo American, which rejected a last-ditch request for more time, ending for now its six-week pursuit.
BHP's aim was to secure Anglo's prized copper assets in Latin America and increase access to a metal central to the global shift toward clean energy and electric vehicles. But the structure of BHP's deal, which required Anglo to unbundle its South African platinum and iron ore businesses, was a major reason for its collapse.
Anglo had granted BHP a one-week extension until Wednesday to submit a binding offer, after rejecting a third takeover proposal. Under U.K. rules, BHP cannot return for at least six months, unless there is another offer for the London-listed miner.
Anglo said on Wednesday it was fully focused on plans to increase value to shareholders. Reuters
TECHNOLOGY
OpenAI Reaches Deals
With Vox and Atlantic
OpenAI said on Wednesday that it had signed content and product partnerships with The Atlantic and Vox Media, helping the artificial intelligence firm to boost and train its products.
Last week, OpenAI signed a similar deal with News Corp. Such partnerships are not only crucial for the training of AI models, they can also be lucrative for news publishers, which have traditionally been denied a slice of profits internet giants earn for distributing their content.
(The New York Times has sued OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, claiming they used copyrighted news articles without permission.)
Vox Media said OpenAI would help the company develop products for its consumers and advertising partners.
Separately, The Atlantic said it was creating an "experimental microsite, called Atlantic Labs," that would also pilot OpenAI's tech. Reuters

Nissan Delays Its PlansFor 2 New Electric Sedans
Nissan has paused development plans for two battery-powered sedans while expanding its E.V. lineup to five vehicles in the United States, the Japanese automaker said on Tuesday.
"We are adjusting the timeline for the introduction of these five new models to ensure we bring the vehicles to the market at the right time," a Nissan spokesperson told Reuters.
The company's new lineup for the U.S. also includes battery-powered crossover S.U.V.s. While Nissan's electric sedans are still in the production plan, the company expects the S.U.V.s to be rolled out faster. The company also said its Canton, Miss., factory would support manufacturing of its next-generation vehicles.
The announcement comes as weaker-than-expected E.V. demand prompts automakers to pull back from ambitious electrification plans to focus on hybrids and gas-powered models instead. Reuters
ENTERTAINMENT
Comcast's StreamSaverWill Cost $ 15 Per Month
Comcast's new streaming bundle, packaging its Peacock service with Netflix and Apple TV+, will cost $ 15 per month for all Xfinity internet and TV customers, the media and broadband company said on Tuesday.
The new bundle, StreamSaver, is a "companion to broadband" and offers savings of more than 30 percent to customers, Comcast Cable's chief executive, David Watson, said at the J.P. Morgan Technology, Media and Communications Conference.
Customers can also combine StreamSaver with Comcast's newest offering "NOW TV," which includes more than 40 streaming channels, for $ 30 per month.
"StreamSaver is a home run for consumers who want top-tier entertainment and live sports," Mr. Watson said in a statement.
Comcast said the service would be rolled out on May 29 for Xfinity customers in the United States. Reuters
TRANSPORTATION
Busy Month for Imports Of Vehicles in Georgia
The Georgia Ports Authority reported Tuesday that April was its busiest month ever for automobile shipments as the Port of Brunswick took in thousands of additional car and truck imports rerouted from Baltimore following a deadly bridge collapse.
The second-busiest U.S. port for autos, Brunswick moved over 80,000 vehicles and heavy machinery units across its docks last month, a whopping 44 percent increase compared with April 2023.
The surge included 9,000 automobile imports and 1,000 pieces of heavy machinery that were diverted from the Port of Baltimore, the nation's top auto port. Baltimore has been closed to most ships since the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed March 26, killing six people, after a container ship crashed into one of its columns.
The Brunswick port had plenty of room to absorb the overflow, said Griff Lynch, chief executive of the Georgia Ports Authority. Associated Press

U.A.W. Loss At Mercedes Was a Blow: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: After Mercedes workers voted against joining the United Automobile Workers, the union will have less momentum as it campaigns to organize Southern factories.
After suffering a setback at two Mercedes-Benz plants in Alabama on Friday, the United Automobile Workers union's efforts to organize other auto factories in the South are likely to slow and could struggle to make headway.
About 56 percent of the Mercedes workers who voted rejected the U.A.W. in an election after the union chalked up two major wins this year. In April, workers at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee voted to join the union, the first large nonunion auto plant in the South to do so. Weeks later, the union negotiated a new contract bringing significant pay and benefit improvements for its members at several North Carolina factories owned by Daimler Truck.
"Losing at Mercedes is not death for the union," said Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations. "It just means they'll have less confidence going to the next plant. The U.A.W. is in it for the long run. I don't think they're going to stop just because they lost here."
Since its founding in 1935, the U.A.W. has almost exclusively represented workers employed by the three Michigan-based automakers: General Motors, Ford Motor, and Chrysler, now part of Stellantis. And it has long struggled to make headway at plants owned by foreign manufacturers, especially in Southern states where anti-union sentiment runs deep.
Workers at the Volkswagen plant had voted against being represented by the U.A.W. twice by narrow margins before the recent union win there. An effort a decade ago to organize one of the Mercedes plants failed to build enough support for an election.
Harley Shaiken, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, noted that broad union organizing efforts seldom proceeded smoothly. In the 1930s, the U.A.W. won recognition at G.M. and Chrysler but struggled at Ford, which continued employing nonunion workers for a few years.
"I have no doubt they will continue organizing and eventually try for another vote," he said.
In its past efforts in the South, the union was hampered by a negative image, which may have also played a part in the U.A.W.'s loss at Mercedes. For years, the three Michigan automakers were cutting jobs and closing plants, in part because of rigid and costly labor contracts. The union was also hurt by corruption cases that put several former senior officials, including two former U.A.W. presidents, behind bars.
Business leaders in Alabama ran a campaign against the U.A.W. that was based in part on the contention that the union was responsible for the decline of Detroit. In a January opinion essay published in The Alabama Daily News, the chief executive of the Business Council of Alabama, Helena Duncan, said the state would suffer the same fate if workers voted for the union.
"Much of the decay that exists in the 'Motor City' today results from untenable demands that the U.A.W. placed on its automobile manufacturers, an unwise move that sent untold numbers of jobs to right-to-work states like ours and crippled a once great metropolis," Ms. Duncan wrote.
A year ago, the union elected a new president, Shawn Fain, who was untouched by the corruption scandals and vowed to take a more aggressive approach in contract talks. Then last fall, the union came away with substantial pay and benefit gains in negotiations with the Detroit automakers, after targeted strikes over some 40 days. Hundreds of Southern autoworkers began reaching out, asking for help organizing their nonunion plants. The U.A.W. responded by announcing that it would spend $ 40 million on organizing drives over the next two years.
"I'm not scared at all," Mr. Fain said Friday in Alabama after the union lost the Mercedes vote. "I believe workers want unions, I believe they want justice, and we're going to continue doing what we can do."
Mercedes in a statement emphasized its direct relationship with workers and said it looked forward to making sure the company was "not only their employer of choice, but a place they would recommend to friends and family."
The union has signaled that it expects to focus its organizing efforts on another Alabama plant -- a Hyundai factory in Montgomery. But organizing that plant will probably be even harder than the campaign at the Mercedes factories, said Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business professor who follows the auto industry.
The U.A.W. had allies at Volkswagen and Mercedes. Unions are powerful players in Germany, where those two companies are based. Under German law, worker representatives must occupy half the seats on a company's supervisory board, the equivalent of an American board of directors.
Volkswagen and Mercedes both have groups called works councils through which managers and employees discuss and negotiate workplace issues and production plans. In its drive at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, the U.A.W. had the support of the company's works council and IG Metall, the powerful union that represents all German automotive workers.
The U.A.W. won't have that kind of support at Hyundai's Montgomery plant, Mr. Gordon said. "In general, Korean car companies have more adversarial relationships with unions than do the German manufacturers," he said. "Korean companies are less used to sitting together in a conference room with unions."
Last year, weeks after the U.A.W. won pay and benefit increases from the three Michigan-based automakers, Hyundai announced that it would increase its workers' pay sharply over the next four years -- a move widely seen as an attempt to dampen workers' interest in joining the U.A.W.
"The decision to be represented by a union is up to our team members," Hyundai said in a statement.
The Montgomery plant makes two popular sport utility vehicles -- the Tucson and Santa Fe -- and employs about 4,000 workers. An earlier U.A.W. drive to organize the plant in 2016 petered out without coming to a vote.
Last fall, the union said it planned to target plants owned by 10 foreign-owned automakers -- Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes, Subaru, Volkswagen, Mazda and Volvo -- and others owned by Tesla, which is based in Texas, and two smaller electric vehicle start-ups, Lucid and Rivian, both based in California.
The U.S. plants owned by those foreign and U.S. companies employ nearly 150,000 workers in 13 states, the union said.
In Alabama, however, the U.A.W. faced perhaps a more hostile environment than anywhere else. While it was campaigning at Mercedes, Gov. Kay Ivey spoke out against the union and headed a group of six Southern governors, all Republicans, who issued a letter suggesting unionizing could cause automakers to move jobs out of their states. One senior Alabama politician described the U.A.W. as "leeches."
Mercedes brought in Nick Saban, the hugely popular former football coach at the University of Alabama, to talk to workers in an effort to persuade them to vote against the U.A.W.
Unions are traditionally seen as a Northern institution and are often linked with the civil rights movement, which alienates many people in Alabama, Mr. Gordon said. "It's a very tough place for the U.A.W.," he said.
That antipathy could also make it hard for the U.A.W. to negotiate contracts guaranteeing its members raises and other gains even if it wins unionizing votes. Lawmakers who oppose unions may put pressure on employers not to make big concessions in negotiations.
Mr. Fain and the U.A.W. have argued that unions are the best way for workers to demand higher wages when automakers are enjoying strong sales and profits in North America.
Public support of unions is stronger than it has been in years, including in the South. This year, 600 workers at an electric bus factory in Alabama voted to join the Communications Workers of America union. A week ago, they negotiated a new contract delivering pay raises and enhanced benefits.
The U.A.W. and other unions also have enjoyed the support of President Biden, who last fall joined striking autoworkers on a picket line in Michigan. The union endorsed Mr. Biden in this year's election.
But that close association with the president may also hurt the U.A.W. with conservative workers in a Southern state who prefer Mr. Biden's opponent -- former President Donald J. Trump. Mr. Fain and Mr. Trump have often criticized each other, but polls have shown that a sizable minority of union households support the former president.

Yes, Your Allergies Really Are Getting Worse: [Editorial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It's spring, and I love spring more than I love almost anything else about the natural world, but I don't love the pollen. My eyes itch. My nose is stopped up. First thing in the morning I sneeze. Last thing at night I sneeze. My husband turns away from me to sleep because the pollen grains clinging to my hair make him sneeze, too.
I was never prone to seasonal allergies before I moved to Middle Tennessee, which is not even one of the 10 most challenging places for allergy sufferers in this country. I am now up to three over-the-counter medications a day, and I have developed a tiny dependence on Fisherman's Friend lozenges, which work a bit like the Vicks VapoRub of my childhood memories. Vicks is still around -- the comedian Wanda Sykes has a wonderful bit about it -- but Fisherman's Friend doesn't announce my presence in advance the way Vicks would.
I also drink gallons of an herbal tea labeled "congestion relief," though I no longer believe that relief is possible. The hill of spring allergies, which in Middle Tennessee used to be on the downslope by now, has become an all-year mountain, with tree pollen and grass pollen and ragweed pollen rolling together in great clouds from late February right up till Thanksgiving.
But it's worse in spring. I can stand at my back door and watch a white pine like this one sending out waves of pollen that remind me of the crop-duster scene in "North by Northwest." In spring, my glasses are coated with pollen outside and in. In spring, my little red Nissan Leaf looks like a little orange Leaf, and the gray boards of our back deck look as though they've grown a coating of new moss.
The only relief for any of it is a good soaking rain, but the reprieve of rain is only temporary. Increased rainfall prolongs the blooming season of many trees, grasses and other plants. (Most wildflowers are pollinated by insects and therefore aren't prime allergy-inducers, but some, like ragweed, are wind-pollinated, which means they literally throw their pollen to the winds -- and into human faces.) A prolonged blooming season in turn allows plants to produce more pollen.
Seasonal allergies are nothing new, but they've been worsening as the climate grows warmer. The growing season starts earlier now -- in North America an average of 20 days earlier -- and lasts longer, too, extending the length of time when plants are pumping pollen into the air. And the resulting misery arises not just because there's more pollen to breathe in or because it's around for increasingly longer seasons. At least one study has indicated that the more carbon there is in the air, the more potent the pollen itself is.
Hay fever kicks in when the immune system isn't able to distinguish between a genuine threat (like a virus) and particles like pollen that are harmless. That's why adults can develop seasonal allergies when they move to a new region and encounter pollens their immune system doesn't recognize. Now, thanks to climate change, you don't even need to move: The warmer climate is shifting growing zones northward, allowing plants to extend their natural range.
In human beings, this all adds up to seasonal allergies that are more widespread and more severe, and it's only going to get worse: One study predicts a 200 percent increase in pollen production by the end of this century. "In 2018, 7.7 percent of American adults experienced 'hay fever,"' noted the science journalist Yasmin Tayag in The Atlantic last year. "By 2021, that proportion had risen to about a quarter." The article is titled "There Is No Stopping the Allergy Apocalypse."
Weighed against true climate calamities like deadly heat waves and inundated coastal communities, hay fever may seem like little more than an inconvenience. What's a few weeks -- even months -- of itchy eyes and runny noses compared with the global population migrations that are coming? But allergies aren't mere irritants.
Someone who is suffering from seasonal allergies may be less able to exercise, more vulnerable to infection, less productive at work (if not actually absent), more likely to require treatment in an emergency room. Seasonal allergies have been linked to an increase in both the prevalence and severity of asthma, which is particularly worrisome for children.
None of this is surprising to anyone who's paying attention to the way the changing climate affects everything nowadays. Wherever you live, even if you aren't evacuating to avoid a hurricane, or keeping a go bag by the door in case of a wildfire, or wondering if it's time to move to higher ground, climate change is now affecting your daily life. It's making wine taste different, sleep more fitful, air travel more turbulent. It's making the very air harder to breathe.
Meanwhile, the planet will continue to warm, and plants will continue to produce more pollen, and in more concentrated doses, for a longer period of time each year. People who suffer from seasonal allergies will feel worse, and people who aren't currently troubled by allergy symptoms may yet find themselves sneezing and rubbing their eyes. As Ms. Tayag points out in her Atlantic article, "At this point, not much can be done to stop it."
That's true, but a lot can be done to keep it from getting incomprehensibly worse. In the doom versus optimism debate about the climate, much of the optimism lies in the way technology, shored up by policy and legislation, is rising to the challenge faster and more effectively than we ever imagined it could. "Stunning, record-breaking gains in wind and solar power around the world," David Geddes of The Times writes, means that "a full 30 percent of global electricity was generated by renewables last year." The time we have left to change our climate's devastating trajectory is dwindling, but we are finally beginning to take the steps necessary to change it.
But we are only beginning, and beginnings can be snuffed out. At his Mar-a-Lago resort last month, Donald Trump told a group of oil executives and lobbyists that they should donate $ 1 billion to his campaign because he plans to reverse Joe Biden's clean energy policies, among other environmental protections opposed by Big Oil, if he is returned to the White House.

Court Against Streamlining Item Recovery After Seizure: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Two Alabama women spent more than a year trying to reclaim vehicles they owned, which the police had confiscated after arresting their drivers on drug charges.
The Supreme Court on Thursday made it harder for people whose property had been seized by the police to argue for its swift return.
By a 6-to-3 vote, the court ruled against two Alabama women who had sought prompt hearings to recover cars they owned that had been taken by the police in connection with crimes committed by others.
"After a state seizes and seeks civil forfeiture of personal property, due process requires a timely forfeiture hearing but does not require a separate preliminary hearing," Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh wrote for the majority.
In dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the majority had adopted a wooden approach to a pressing problem.
"The majority today holds that due process never requires the minimal check of a retention hearing before a police officer deprives an innocent owner of her car for months or years," Justice Sotomayor wrote.
Even as the court rejected the women's argument that the Constitution requires streamlined procedures, five justices expressed grave misgivings about the practice of confiscating property said to have been used to commit crimes, known as civil asset forfeiture.
The court ruled in two cases. One of them started after Halima Culley bought a 2015 Nissan Altima for her son to use at college. He was pulled over by the police in 2019 and arrested when they found marijuana. They also seized Ms. Culley's car.
That same year, Lena Sutton lent her 2012 Chevrolet Sonic to a friend. He was stopped for speeding and arrested after the police found methamphetamine. Ms. Sutton's car was also seized.
Alabama law in effect at the time let so-called innocent owners reclaim seized property, and both women ultimately persuaded judges to return their cars. It took more than a year in each case, though there was some dispute about whether the women could have done more to hasten the process.
Ms. Culley and Ms. Sutton filed class actions in federal court saying that they should have been afforded prompt interim hearings to argue for the return of the vehicles while their cases moved forward. Lower courts ruled against them.
Justice Kavanaugh wrote that the Constitution's due process clause does not require the preliminary hearing the women sought.
"Culley and Sutton's argument for a separate preliminary hearing appears in many respects to be a backdoor argument for a more timely hearing so that a property owner with a good defense against forfeiture can recover her property more quickly," he wrote. "But the court's precedents already require a timely hearing."
Alabama has since amended its forfeiture law to allow owners of seized property to request expedited hearings.
"Our decision today does not preclude those legislatively prescribed innovations," Justice Kavanaugh wrote. "Rather, our decision simply addresses the base-line protection of the due process clause."
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett joined the majority opinion.
In a concurring opinion, Justice Gorsuch, joined by Justice Thomas, said he agreed that no separate hearing was required. But he added that questions remained about whether "contemporary civil forfeiture practices can be squared with the Constitution's promise of due process."
Civil forfeiture, he wrote, "has become a booming business," one in which federal forfeitures alone brought in $ 2.5 billion in 2018.
"In future cases, with the benefit of full briefing," he wrote, "I hope we might begin the task of assessing how well the profound changes in civil forfeiture practices we have witnessed in recent decades comport with" due process principles.
In her dissent in the case, Culley v. Marshall, No. 22-585, Justice Sotomayor, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, made similar points.
"Police agencies often have a financial incentive to seize as many cars as possible and try to retain them," she wrote. "The forfeiture revenue is not a supplement; many police agencies in fact depend on cash flow from forfeitures for their budgets."
"These cash incentives not only encourage counties to create labyrinthine processes for retrieving property in the hopes that innocent owners will abandon attempts at recovery," Justice Sotomayor added, "they also influence which laws police enforce, how they enforce them and who they enforce them against."

Data Collection by Cars Is Drawing Scrutiny From U.S. Regulators: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Modern cars are internet-connected and have hundreds of sensors. Lawmakers and regulators have concerns about what's happening with all that data.
In the American imagination, car keys and a driver's license have long represented freedom, autonomy and privacy. But modern cars, which have hundreds of sensors, cameras and internet connectivity, are now potential spying machines acting in ways drivers do not completely understand.
That has lawmakers and regulators concerned.
On Tuesday, Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts sent a letter to Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission, urging the agency to investigate automakers for sharing drivers' location information with the police. The senators, both Democrats, say this sharing can "seriously threaten Americans' privacy" by revealing their visits to protests, health clinics, places of worship, support groups or other sensitive places.
"As far-right politicians escalate their war on women, I'm especially concerned about cars revealing people who cross state lines to obtain an abortion," Senator Wyden said in a statement.
Government attention to the car industry is intensifying, experts say, because of the increased technological sophistication of modern cars.
Investigators for the Government Accountability Office recently went car shopping, undercover, to see whether salespeople were overselling autonomous driving abilities. In a March report, the agency concluded that consumers don't fully understand crash avoidance technologies and driver support systems, the improper use of which "can compromise their safety benefits and even pose a risk on the road."
The Federal Communications Commission and California lawmakers want to prevent mobile car apps from being used for stalking and harassment. The F.C.C. has proposed regulating automakers under the Safe Connections Act -- aimed, originally, at phone carriers -- while California is likely to pass a law that would accomplish the same thing, requiring car companies to cut off abusers' remote access to victims' cars.
"No survivor of domestic violence and abuse should have to choose between giving up their car and allowing themselves to be stalked and harmed by those who can access its connectivity and data," Jessica Rosenworcel, who leads the F.C.C., said in a statement.
Privacy regulators have opened investigations. California's privacy regulator has been looking into data use from connected cars for nearly a year, while the F.T.C. already appears to be acting on a letter Senator Markey sent in February, urging the agency to investigate automakers' privacy practices.
Last month, the F.T.C. solicited reports from drivers who objected to how data from their cars had been used. An investigator from the agency reached out to a man named in a New York Times article whose insurance premium increased after General Motors provided data about his driving behavior to the insurance industry. ("Since FTC investigations are nonpublic, we generally don't comment on whether we are investigating a particular matter," said a spokesperson for the agency.)
"To my mind, there has been far too little oversight into automakers' privacy policies, so the more watchdogs, the better," Senator Wyden said.
The most recent letter to the F.T.C. reveals the findings of a yearlong query of 14 automakers that Senator Wyden's office said had jointly received more than 1,400 police requests for location information over the past two years.
Only five of the automakers -- G.M., Honda, Ford, Tesla and Stellantis -- required the police to get a warrant before turning over a car's current or historical whereabouts, with Ford recently enacting that requirement. Tesla is the only automaker that tells customers about such requests, according to the letter.
"In contrast, Toyota, Nissan, Subaru, Volkswagen, BMW, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz and Kia all confirmed that they will disclose location data to U.S. government agencies in response to subpoenas, which do not require a judge's approval," the senators wrote to Ms. Khan. They said this violated a commitment the automakers made in a set of privacy principles they submitted to the F.T.C. a decade ago about how they would protect drivers' sensitive data.
"This is a complex issue; automakers are committed to protecting sensitive vehicle location information," said Brian Weiss, a spokesman for the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade association. "Vehicle location information is only provided to law enforcement under specific and limited circumstances, such as when the automaker is provided a warrant or court order or in situations where there is an imminent threat of serious bodily harm or death to an individual."
Automakers generally retain a car's location information for years -- as long as 15 years in the case of Hyundai. Of the 45 location data requests that Hyundai received in the past two years from the police, slightly more than half involved stolen vehicles, the company's spokesman, Ira Gabriel, said.
"There's a renewed focus on cars, and the data practices associated with them," said Andrew Crawford, policy counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology. He attributed this to increased consumer awareness about the components in modern cars and the fact that car data "may be going to folks that they did not contemplate, did not know about and did not want."
At the same time, however, some regulators are pushing automakers to put more technology into cars to improve safety on the roads, which may require even more data collection.
The National Transportation Safety Board has recommended in-car systems in all new vehicles that would tell drivers to slow down when they exceed the speed limit. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has taken steps to require impairment-detection systems in all new vehicles that would prevent a car from operating when the driver had been drinking or using drugs.
When it comes to car safety, the conversation has changed from improving seatbelts to installing more cameras and sensors, said Adonne Washington, a lawyer at the Future of Privacy Forum who wrote a recent report on the privacy implications of proposed safety systems.
For instance, "a mandate for alcohol detection technology in vehicles creates a whole different category of information," she said.
W. James Denvil, a partner at Hogan Lovells who has represented automakers, said the increased scrutiny from regulators was expected.
Vehicles offer "extraordinary benefits," he said. New technologies can enhance safety and the driving experience, while data from cars can be used to improve transportation infrastructure.
"We've got innovative technologies and old regulations," Mr. Denvil said. "There's going to be some surprises and some bumps in the road."

Yes, You Can Grow Potted Topiaries: [Real Estate Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: You just have to follow a few simple rules. (Also, forget about going away for the weekend.)
Have topiary (and eclipse glasses), will travel.
Ken Selody, of Atlock Farm, put out the word in January: He had researched the path of totality of this week's solar eclipse and considered optimal viewing possibilities. In early April, he planned to be Texas-bound.
"If I drove my van full of topiary through Tennessee, Arkansas and Texas," Mr. Selody, who is based in New Jersey, asked on Instagram, "are there people or shops that would be interested in having me stop?"
This is how the popular topiary artist, whose longtime clients include Martha Stewart, rolls these days in his high-top white Nissan. Yes, the nursery is open for retail sales on Saturdays, but Mr. Selody also makes house calls.
His busy spring schedule includes shows like the Trade Secrets plant and antiques fair (May 19) at Lime Rock Park, in Salisbury, Conn., and the Ladew Topiary Gardens festival (May 4) in Monkton, Md. But his "away" schedule has expanded -- and not just in pursuit of eclipses.
Mr. Selody loves a good road trip, and when he opens the back of the van at his destination -- the built-in shelves stuffed with lollipop-, tower- and spiral-shaped potted plants fashioned from myrtle, rosemary and more -- those on the receiving end seem delighted, too.
But wait: What are those flashy colored plants among the payload -- the ones with leaves not of green but gold, or maroon splashed with yellow? Are those Coleus standards?
"Nobody who has seen a Coleus topiary has ever said to me, 'Oh, that old thing?"' Mr. Selody said.
Seeing that most familiar of springtime garden-center offerings transformed in this way elicits smiles -- and questions about how topiary happens.
The Quickest Topiary: Coleus
Mr. Selody founded Atlock Farm in 1987 in Somerset, N.J., on a piece of the family turf-grass farm where he was raised. Later this spring, he is moving his nursery into greenhouses 25 minutes away, in Neshanic Station.
Ornamental horticulture became a hobby while he was studying photography in college, and he saw his first topiary sometime around then, in "this big tidal wave of English garden style coming over from there, in all of the new books full of color photographs," he recalled.
Over the years, he has applied the technique to a number of perennial species. Many trees, shrubs, sub-shrubs and even vines can become topiaries, he has discovered, but some are easier, better or faster.
"You can plant an oak tree in your front yard, or in a pot for that matter, and turn it into a topiary," he said. "Or a plant that would normally creep, like a thyme plant, can be staked and turned into a topiary."
His most popular topiary offering is Myrtle (Myrtus communis), which can take up to three years to go from a cutting to a finished, two-foot-tall standard with a head the size of a soccer ball. Rosemary is among the easiest, and Eugenia myrtifolia, a myrtle relative, is pretty fast and cooperative. His palette extends to Euonymus fortunei and lavender (the Lavandula hybrid Goodwin Creek Grey), lavender cotton (Santolina chamaecyparissus), and even fuchsia and chrysanthemums, as well as scented geraniums and some of the smaller zonal Pelargonium.
But Coleus, which takes just six to nine months from cutting to finished standard -- the classic shape of a tall, single stem topped by a foliar globe -- has them all beat for speed.
He can't remember when he trained his first Coleus. Certainly, it was decades ago.
Although it is marketed to gardeners alongside annuals for seasonal color, Coleus is perennial in its tropical or subtropical places of origin. For those curious about how topiary works, there is perhaps no better introductory plant, he said, but not all of the dizzying varieties out there are equally suited to training.
To get a fuller, denser head, a variety with closely spaced internodes -- the section of stem between nodes, or growth points -- is desirable.
"If you have a plant with really long internodes, you're going to have to make this great, big, monstrous head of a thing," Mr. Selody said. "It's going to take longer, and it's going to look really awkward for a very long time."
Smaller leaf size generally indicates a better candidate, too.
What's undesirable? Coleus varieties that are inclined to flower early, which is an impediment, especially while you're training the supporting stem before shaping the lollipop on top.
When that happens, he said, it's as if the plant "self-pinches," terminating its own leader, or central growth point, and forcing side shoots to form instead.
"It's not such a big deal once you have the head on it," he said. "But when you're trying to grow the stem up, and every three inches the central leader forms a flower, you have to use the side branch that comes from behind it instead, and you don't get a nice, straight stem."
'They Need Almost Daily Attention'
The trickiest part for the gardener who is new to potted topiaries of any species? Not getting too attached. In the average household, Mr. Selody said, these are not forever plants.
Given the exact conditions he provides in his greenhouse, a potted topiary could live for decades. But they also need something more.
"There are people who have perfectly good conditions," he said. "But they might like to go away for a week. And these plants are like I.C.U. plants -- they need almost daily attention."
So if you're planning even a long weekend away, make sure you get a plant sitter.
Knowing all of that, do you dare surrender to a whirlwind romance of a year or maybe two with one of these incredibly charismatic creatures? Of course, Mr. Selody votes "yes."
"People spend money on scented candles and expensive shampoo and bars of soap, or on chocolate-covered strawberries and cut flowers and bottles of wine that are gone in 15 minutes, and they think nothing of that," he said. "But somehow when it's a plant, it's a different story. I see my job as sort of giving people special dispensation to believe that they don't have to have it forever."
In your togetherness time with any topiary (not just Coleus), remember these relationship-enhancing essentials.
Trim regularly: Don't let the plant get misshapen and then inflict a severe haircut on it.
Water regularly, too: That can be as often as daily, especially if your topiary is in a small pot outside in summer.
Fertilize: "These plants eat more than you think they eat," Mr. Selody said. Because organic fertilizers like fish emulsion have very low concentrations of nitrogen and other elements, he recommends a monthly application of a water-soluble food labeled with a 20-20-20 NPK ratio instead.
And finally: Be a partner your topiary can count on.
"It's imperative that you do for your topiary plant what nobody else will do for you," he said. "You have to remove all the stress from its life."
Step by Step: How to Start a Coleus Topiary
Begin by making a cutting from a Coleus stem that hasn't already been pinched, so that the growth tip at the top of the cutting (also known as the leader) is intact. Removing the tip will promote lateral branching -- which you don't want -- and redirecting the resulting errant shoot to make it vertical "almost always leaves a little jog in the stem," Mr. Selody said.
Coleus cuttings will root anywhere along the stem, and they'll root easily in soilless potting medium in pots, cells or flats. Mr. Selody sticks his into trays of Oasis wedges -- similar to floral foam -- sold specifically for propagation.
When the roots have formed about two weeks later, move each cutting into a four-inch pot of soilless mix.
Over the next few months, direct each plant's energy to straight upward growth by removing all side shoots that form along the stem, and also most of the leaves, allowing maybe seven to nine leaves to remain for photosynthesis.
As the plant grows, position a bamboo cane so that it reaches just above the desired stem height, securing it with a raffia tie to provide support.
When the stem reaches your target height -- perhaps at six or nine inches -- identify three pairs of upper leaves to incorporate into a head. The middle set should be at the very top of the bamboo, with one set below and another above. At this point, remove any lower leaves.
It's now time to pinch out the central leader. This is a signal to the plant to force lateral growth from those six leaf nodes. Each one will form its own central leader, known as a lateral; it behaves like a central leader, but grows sideways. Those laterals will need pinching in time, too, as they push more growth, encouraging a third group of branches, as the head architecture develops exponentially.
"You pinch or snip six times, and then you're going to go to 12, and then you're going to go to 18," Mr. Selody said. "You have to start out with a two-inch ball. A two-inch ball goes to a three-inch ball; a three-inch ball goes to a four-inch ball. And you have to keep growing it that way. There's no shortcut."

U.A.W. Gets New Toehold In the South: [News Analysis]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Some experts say the outcome at a plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., may be organized labor's most significant advance in decades. But the road could get rockier.
By voting to join the United Automobile Workers, Volkswagen workers in Tennessee have given the union something it has never had: a factory-wide foothold at a major foreign automaker in the South.
The result, in an election that ended on Friday, will enable the union to bargain for better wages and benefits. Now the question is what difference it will make beyond the Volkswagen plant.
Labor experts said success at VW might position the union to replicate its showing at other auto manufacturers throughout the South, the least unionized region of the country. Some argued that the win could help set off a rise in union membership at other companies that exceeds the uptick of the past few years, when unions won elections at Starbucks and Amazon locations.
"It's a big vote, symbolically and substantively," said Jake Rosenfeld, a sociologist who studies labor at Washington University in St. Louis.
The next test for the U.A.W. will come in a vote in mid-May at a Mercedes-Benz plant in Alabama.
In addition, at least 30 percent of workers have signed cards authorizing the U.A.W. to represent them at a Hyundai plant in Alabama and a Toyota plant in Missouri, according to the union. That is the minimum needed to force an election, though the union has yet to petition for one in either location.
"People only take action when they believe there is an alternative to the status quo that has a plausible chance of winning," said Barry Eidlin, a sociologist at McGill University in Montreal.
Still, it's unclear how far the campaign may spread beyond German manufacturers. Volkswagen and Mercedes have been relatively friendly to unions outside the United States, and a recent German law could prompt financial penalties against companies that crack down on union organizing.
Compared with previous elections in Chattanooga, Volkswagen's pushback against the union was mild this time, according to workers. The company presented reasons it believed a union was unnecessary, including pay that is above average for the Chattanooga area, but said it left the decision to the workers.
Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at the research firm AutoForecast Solutions, predicted that most Japanese and South Korean manufacturers with plants in the South would be more difficult targets for the U.A.W. because they have worked hard to develop a close relationship with workers or have butted heads with unions in their home country, or both.
The Chattanooga vote could also lead to a broader political battle over unionization within the region. Business and political leaders in the South say a greater union presence could threaten their states' economic advantages and slow down job creation.
"If we become less competitive, why not do it in Detroit?" said Gerald McCormick, a Republican who was the Tennessee House majority leader when the U.A.W. first prompted a union vote at the Volkswagen plant in 2014.
Six Republican governors highlighted those concerns in a statement on Tuesday, which said that the union campaign was "driven by misinformation and scare tactics." Opposition from state and local politicians helped defeat the union in a vote at a Nissan plant in Mississippi in 2017 and in elections at VW in Chattanooga in 2014 and 2019.
The U.A.W.'s political support for Democrats -- the union endorsed President Biden's re-election in January -- could also be a vulnerability in such a fight. Isaac Meadows, a worker at the Volkswagen plant, said in an interview in February that the endorsement had led some co-workers to have second thoughts about the union, but that he had advised them that "the political landscape changes every four to eight years and doesn't directly affect us."
Even so, a change in presidential administrations could bring a more skeptical National Labor Relations Board, which presides over union elections and enforces labor law and could make it more difficult for the union to win at other plants.
Worker advocates and union organizers acknowledged that the win in Chattanooga could trigger a strong response. "You have to imagine the backlash," said Erica Smiley, executive director of Jobs With Justice, which helps workers seeking to unionize and bargain collectively. "My hope is that enough people understand both within the U.A.W. and within the union world writ large that you have to defend the union election."
Organizers also conceded that any momentum generated by the union victory in Chattanooga could be muted until workers there win a contract that brings concrete gains, a process that can take years.
It has been two years since Amazon workers at a Staten Island warehouse became the first to win a union election at the company in the United States, and they have yet to begin bargaining as the company challenges the victory. The lack of progress toward a contract appears to have complicated organizing efforts at other Amazon sites.
But the Volkswagen employees in Chattanooga have advantages that the Amazon workers lack. Unlike the Amazon Labor Union, their union is well established and can invest millions of dollars in staff and legal work to help bargain a contract. And Volkswagen appears more willing than Amazon to bargain, partly because of its labor ties in Germany.
"If workers in Chattanooga get a great contract, a big raise, better health benefits, and then the same thing at Mercedes, there will be a lot more good opportunities to win good contracts in short order," said Madeline Janis, co-executive director of Jobs to Move America, a group that seeks to create good jobs in clean technology industries.
Ms. Janis, whose group is involved in unionizing factory workers in the South, said the momentum could travel beyond the auto industry to other manufacturers because employees at different companies in the region often know one another and discuss these issues. "Their brothers and sisters and spouses are working at other plants," she said. "It will be all over social media."
And some experts said that a rise in unionization at factories could spread to other types of jobs. "The enthusiasm is contagious across sectors," said David Pryzbylski, a lawyer at Barnes & Thornburg who represents employers. "People look at it and say, 'Hey, I think there's something here. Maybe I should be interested in it, too."'
Several workers echoed the point, saying they had drawn encouragement from labor actions in other industries over the past few years. Successful campaigns in Hollywood and at companies like Starbucks and Apple "have been a major boon for us," said Emma Geiger, a worker at Sega of America who helped unionize the video game maker last year. "Especially in the perception of unions on the whole as not something to be feared, but to be embraced."
Overall, nearly 70 percent of Americans say they support unions, according to Gallup, up from about 50 percent a decade and a half ago. After dropping for several years, the number of union members increased by nearly 280,000 in 2022 and by about half that amount last year, though the percentage of workers in unions dropped slightly because even more people entered the work force. Filings for union elections were up 35 percent in the six months ending in March compared with the same period one year earlier, according to the National Labor Relations Board.
During the mid-1930s, union membership grew by several hundred thousand for three straight years, then jumped by roughly three million in 1937, most of it after the U.A.W. organized General Motors.
Another expansion on this scale is unlikely given changes in the economy, including the shift away from manufacturing as a source of jobs. But Michael Lotito, a lawyer at Littler Mendelson, which represents employers, said the past few years had produced "a lot of kindling" that could make it easier for a fire of sorts to spread.
Citing workers' frustrations over the pandemic and return-to-office policies, which they have amplified on social media, he said that "from a management perspective, it's of concern."

Workers in Tennessee Vote to Join the U.A.W.: [National Desk]

Full text: The Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga is set to become the first unionized auto factory in the South not owned by one of Detroit's Big Three.
In a landmark victory for organized labor, workers at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee have voted overwhelmingly to join the United Automobile Workers union, becoming the first nonunion auto plant in a Southern state to do so.
The company said in a statement late Friday that the union had won 2,628 votes, with 985 opposed, in a three-day election. Two earlier bids by the U.A.W. to organize the Chattanooga factory over the last 10 years were narrowly defeated.
The outcome is a breakthrough for the labor movement in a region where anti-union sentiment has been strong for decades. And it comes six months after the U.A.W. won record wage gains and improved benefits in negotiations with the Detroit automakers.
The U.A.W. has for more than 80 years represented workers employed by General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, the producer of Chrysler, Jeep, Ram and Dodge vehicles, and has organized some heavy-truck and bus factories in the South.
But the union had failed in previous attempts to organize any of the two dozen automobile factories owned by other companies across an area stretching from South Carolina to Texas and as far north as Ohio and Indiana.
With the victory in Chattanooga, the U.A.W. will turn its focus to other Southern plants. A vote will take place in mid-May at a Mercedes-Benz plant in Vance, Ala., near Tuscaloosa. The U.A.W. is hoping to organize a half-dozen or more plants over the next two years.
"Tonight you all together have taken a giant, historic step," Shawn Fain, the president of the U.A.W., said at a celebratory gathering in Chattanooga. "Tonight we celebrate this historic moment in our nation's and our union's history. Let's get to it and go to work and win more for the working class of this nation."
A string of victories for the U.A.W. could have profound effects for Southern auto workers and the broader auto industry. Nonunion auto workers typically earn significantly lower wages than those in U.A.W.-represented plants, and collective bargaining could bring them substantial increases in pay, benefits and job security.
"Volkswagen workers will have a chance for better pay and working conditions under a collective bargaining agreement," said Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations. "They'll have a lot of job protections under a union contract that they don't have now."
At G.M., Ford and Stellantis, any layoffs have to be planned with advance notice to the union, and workers get supplemented unemployment benefits. Nonunion plants don't have to take such measures.
A large U.A.W. presence in the South would also upset an automotive landscape in which U.A.W. contracts have left G.M., Ford and Stellantis with higher labor costs than nonunion rivals like Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Tesla and Hyundai.
"This is a watershed moment for the industry," said Harley Shaiken, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, who has followed the U.A.W. for more than three decades. "It sets an example that would resonate across the industry, and across other industries where there's a large presence of nonunion workers."
The U.A.W.'s success in the negotiations with the Big Three in the fall set off a surge in interest among Southern autoworkers in organizing their own plants, the union said, and prompted the U.A.W. to kick off a $ 40 million effort to support them.
Volkswagen workers who voted in favor of U.A.W. representation said they hoped the union would help them win higher wages and more paid time off. The Chattanooga factory currently pays a top wage of about $ 35 an hour, compared with the top wage of more than $ 40 an hour that G.M., Ford and Stellantis now pay U.A.W. workers.
The U.A.W. contracts also provide health care coverage that is almost entirely paid by the companies, substantial profit-sharing bonuses, cost-of-living adjustments to insulate workers from inflation and generous retirement programs.
Among those voting for the U.A.W. in Chattanooga was Tony Akridge, 48, who is in his second year at the VW plant, working on motors and transmissions on the night shift. His $ 23 hourly wage exceeded what he earned in previous jobs, he said, but he voted for the U.A.W. in hopes that the union could help improve workers' living standards.
"It gives us a better opportunity," Mr. Akridge said. "They pay us OK, but it's not good enough for the things they need done. Noting the rising cost of living, he added that the union "will get better benefits toward that, making life just a little bit more easy."
Others are counting on U.A.W. representation to bring more paid time off. Most VW workers must either take unpaid time off when the plant shuts down in the summer and around the holidays, or use paid time off to cover those periods. If they do, many are left with only a few days to cover any sick days or family leave the rest of the year, workers said.
"We're forced to use our P.T.O. a lot instead of using it on our own terms sometimes," said Craig Jackson, 56, who voted for the union.
At the Detroit automakers, U.A.W. workers get up to five weeks of vacation and 19 paid holidays, and are allowed two weeks for parental leave.
Workers who opposed the union at VW said they were unsure what gains the U.A.W. could bring them.
"You really don't have any kind of guarantee with them," said Darrell Belcher, 54, who has worked on the assembly floor for 13 years and voted against the U.A.W. in the two previous elections at the plant. "I'm not saying we won't gain anything, but we are probably going to lose something just to gain it."
As the voting was about to start, the governors of Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas -- all Republicans -- issued a statement on Tuesday saying unionizing would jeopardize auto jobs in their states.
"We want to keep good-paying jobs and continue to grow the American auto manufacturing sector here," the governors said. "A successful unionization drive will stop this growth in its tracks, to the detriment of American workers."
But even some VW workers who opposed the U.A.W. said they did not think union representation would endanger the Chattanooga plant. "I do not feel that the plant will leave Chattanooga or the South," said Cody Rose, 34, a 13-year veteran of the plant who works in body shop production. "Volkswagen has too much invested in this area."
The Chattanooga plant opened in 2011, and employs 5,500 people, of whom about 4,300 were eligible to vote in the union election. The plant produces the VW Atlas, a large sport utility vehicle, and an electric vehicle, the ID.4. It is Volkswagen's only plant in the United States, and was the only VW plant in the world that was not unionized.
The U.A.W. had some advantages in winning support at Volkswagen. Its effort had the support of IG Metall, the powerful union that represents autoworkers in Germany. German companies also have a strong tradition of giving workers a voice. Under German law, worker representatives must hold half the seats on a company's supervisory board, the equivalent of a board of directors.
The U.A.W. can now turn its attention to the Mercedes plant in Alabama, which employs about 6,100 people. The union tried to organize that plant once before, but the effort died out before coming to a vote.

Voting Tests Union's Push At VW Plant: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The United Automobile Workers hopes contract gains at the Big Three carmakers will provide momentum in a broad effort to organize nonunion plants.
Last fall the United Automobile Workers union won big pay increases from the Detroit automakers, and the impact rippled quickly through the nonunion auto plants scattered across the South.
Afterward, Toyota, Honda, Volkswagen, Nissan, Hyundai and Tesla raised wages for their own hourly workers in the United States, none of whom are unionized. On production lines in Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and elsewhere, those pay increases have been referred to as the "U.A.W. bump."
Now 4,300 workers at Volkswagen's plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., will test whether the union can achieve an even greater bump. On Wednesday, they began voting on whether to join the U.A.W., and the prospects of a union victory appear high. About 70 percent of the workers pledged to vote yes before the union asked for a vote, according to the U.A.W.
"I think our chances are excellent," said Kelcey Smith, 48, who has worked in the VW plant's paint department for a year and is a member of a committee working to build support for the U.A.W. "The energy is high. I think we are going to nail it."
Volkswagen has presented reasons it believes a union is not needed at the plant, including pay that is above average for the Chattanooga region. But it has also said it encourages all workers to vote in the election, which is to conclude on Friday, and decide for themselves. "No one will lose their job for voting for or against the union," a company spokesman said.
The stakes go beyond the Tennessee plant, Volkswagen's only U.S. factory. A victory there would add fuel to the U.A.W.'s push to extend its presence to the more than two dozen nonunion auto plants in the United States, mostly clustered in Southern states where union resistance has been strong historically, and where right-to-work laws make it hard for unions to organize workers.
The U.A.W.'s chances beyond the Volkswagen factory are unclear. Japanese and South Korean automakers have demonstrated more forceful opposition to the U.A.W. than the German companies. Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, has spoken out against the U.A.W. on several occasions over the last few years.
And on Tuesday, the Republican governors of six states -- Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas -- denounced the U.A.W. drive, saying in a statement that they were "highly concerned about the unionization campaign driven by misinformation and scare tactics that the U.A.W. has brought into our states."
"We have worked tirelessly on behalf of our constituents to bring good-paying jobs to our states," the governors declared. "These jobs have become part of the fabric of the automotive manufacturing industry. Unionization would certainly put our states' jobs in jeopardy."
The vote at VW will be followed by another election -- as yet unscheduled -- at a Mercedes-Benz plant in Vance, Ala., where the U.A.W. says a majority of workers have signed up to back the union.
The U.A.W. says victories at VW, Mercedes and other plants would bring increased wages, richer benefits and higher living standards for tens of thousands of workers, many of them in the nation's poorer counties.
Widespread unionizing in the Southern plants would also help level a playing field that for nearly half a century has been tilted against the three unionized Detroit manufacturers -- General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, the parent of Chrysler. In operating nonunion factories, foreign-owned companies have a significant labor-cost advantage over their U.S.-based rivals.
"It would be a revolution for the U.A.W. and for the auto industry," said Harley Shaiken, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, who has followed the U.A.W. for more than three decades. "It would break the glass ceiling for unions in the South, and would mean more purchasing power for working-class people in that region."
The U.A.W. has organized several heavy-truck and bus plants in the South, but for decades has tried and failed to do the same at automobile factories, which are typically larger.
The VW election is the union's third try at the plant. Workers rejected U.A.W. representation by a vote of 712 to 626 in 2014, and by an even narrower margin, 833 to 776, in 2019. Opposition from Republican elected officials in Tennessee was vociferous in those campaigns.
In the last 10 years, the U.A.W. also lost in a 2017 vote at a Nissan plant in Canton, Miss., and an organizing drive at the Mercedes plant fizzled without an election.
In those efforts, the U.A.W. was hampered by a dubious track record and a questionable reputation. Over nearly 30 years, the Detroit automakers closed dozens of plants, eliminating tens of thousands of hourly jobs, despite the U.A.W.'s objections. Some industry executives have blamed high union wages, in part, for pushing G.M. and Chrysler into bankruptcy in 2009. In addition, the union was racked by corruption scandals that resulted in prison sentences for two former presidents and about a dozen other senior U.A.W. officials.
In the past two years, however, the U.A.W. has undergone a transformation. Financial reforms and transparency measures overseen by a federal monitor have helped root out corruption. A feisty president, Shawn Fain, was chosen in the union's first direct election by the membership. In the contract negotiations last year with G.M., Ford and Stellantis, Mr. Fain used a new approach, choosing all three companies as strike targets but shutting down only selected plants, which put pressure on the companies without crippling them or damaging the broader U.S. economy.
After six weeks, the union had contracts raising the top wage 25 percent, to more than $ 40 an hour. Pay for workers lower on the wage scale will rise to the top wage over three years instead of eight. Some will see their pay double. A worker putting in 40 hours a week at the top wage will earn about $ 83,000 a year. In recent years, profit-sharing bonuses have added about $ 9,000 to $ 14,000.
On top of that, the new contracts provide wage adjustments if inflation pushes the cost of living higher, improved pensions and retirement benefits, and increased paid time off. U.A.W. workers have also long had company-paid health care with no deductibles or co-payments.
Hourly wages at the nonunion auto plants used to start under $ 20 and top out around $ 32. The "U.A.W. bump" lifted the range to roughly $ 22 to $ 35. Volkswagen said its workers typically earned about $ 60,000 a year. (The annual mean wage for all occupations in the Chattanooga area was $ 54,480 in May, according to the U.S. Labor Department.)
Seizing on momentum from the Big Three negotiations, Mr. Fain said, the union will spend $ 40 million through 2026 to support organizing at plants owned by Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes, Subaru, Volkswagen, Mazda, Volvo and Tesla, as well as others owned by the electric vehicle start-ups Rivian and Lucid Motors.
VW workers who support the U.A.W. say their wages are pretty good for Tennessee but point 300 miles north to Louisville, Ky., where Ford pays many workers more than $ 40 an hour to make the Expedition sport utility vehicle, which competes with the VW Atlas made in Chattanooga.
"If Ford can pay that much, why can't Volkswagen pay us the same?" said Isaac Meadows, 40, a father of six who has worked at the VW plant for 14 months. "We have more worth than they're paying us."
There are concerns beyond the hourly wage. Workers must use paid time off if they want to be paid during two periods when the plant shuts down around the year-end holidays and in summer.
Once he covers the shutdowns with vacation days, Mr. Meadows said, he is left with about 16 hours of paid time off to cover any family events or sick days for the rest of the year. "I miss my kids' dances, sporting events, family gatherings," he said. "I miss a lot because I've got to work."

Volkswagen Workers Plan Vote on Joining U.A.W.
Workers at Volkswagen's factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., will vote next month on whether they want to be represented by the United Auto Workers union.
The National Labor Relations Board said Monday that the election will take place from April 17 to 19 at the plant, in the first test of the union's effort to organize nonunion automobile factories across the nation.
Workers at the 3.8 million square foot factory with more than 4,000 production workers filed paperwork March 18 seeking the election.
The U.A.W. announced its organizing campaign last fall after it won strong contracts with Detroit automakers. The U.A.W. said it would simultaneously target more than a dozen nonunion auto plants including those run by Tesla, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Kia, Toyota, Honda, and others. Associated Press

Nissan Aims to Expand Stable of Electric Vehicles
Nissan will expand its electric vehicle lineup, develop more powerful batteries and cut production costs, while speeding up the process, in what the Japanese auto maker's chief called "The Arc" pathway to higher sales by 2030.
"The auto industry is now being forced to reshape its values so we can say continuous change is the new normal," Makoto Uchida, Nissan's chief executive said on Monday in outlining an ambitious business plan. "Nissan must change. We cannot succeed if we continue along the same path."
Costs will come down for electric models so they'll be about the same as gasoline models by fiscal 2030, while global sales will grow by a million vehicles during that period, he added.
Last year, Nissan Motor Co. sold nearly 3.4 million vehicles around the world, up about 5 percent from the previous year.
The company is planning 30 new models over the next three years, 16 of them E.V.s. Nissan plans to launch 34 E.V. models from fiscal 2024 through fiscal 2030. Associated Press
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
Ericsson to Lay Off 1,200 Over Lagging 5G Sales
Ericsson said on Monday that it would lay off about 1,200 employees in Sweden as part of cost-cutting measures announced this year as customers reduce their spending on 5G gear.
After cutting thousands of staff last year, telecoms equipment suppliers like Ericsson and Finland's Nokia are expecting 2024 to remain challenging as 5G equipment sales slow in North America and are also expected to ease from record levels in India.
Ericsson told Reuters in January it could look at further cost cuts this year including layoffs.
Citing ongoing negotiations with unions, the company declined to give a figure for how much it could save by cutting staff.
The company said it would continue with initiatives to increase operational efficiency during 2024. Reuters

Markets Tick Up at the Start of a Big Week for Central Banks: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/markets-tick-up-at-start-big-week-central-banks/docview/2963499202/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: U.S. stocks rose Monday ahead of a busy week for central banks around the world that could dictate where interest rates go.
The S&P 500 added 32.33 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,149.42, coming off its first back-to-back weekly losses since October. At one point during the day, it was on track to surpass its closing high set last week.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 75.66, or 0.2 percent, to 38,790.43, and the Nasdaq composite gained 130.27, or 0.8 percent, to 16,103.45.
The highlight for Wall Street this week will likely be the Federal Reserve's meeting on interest rates, which ends on Wednesday. The widespread expectation is for the central bank to hold its main interest rate steady at its highest level since 2001.
But Fed officials will also give updated forecasts for where they see interest rates heading this year and in the long run. They earlier had penciled in three cuts to rates this year, which would relieve pressure on the economy and financial system.
Recent reports on inflation have consistently been coming in worse than expected, though. That could force the Fed to trim how many rate cuts it foresees delivering this year.
Such a move would be a sore disappointment for Wall Street, where stock prices have already run up partly on expectations for lower rates. Treasury yields in the bond market have also eased since last autumn on such expectations, though they've pared those losses on worries about stubbornly high inflation.
It's possible that the Fed could keep its main interest rate near its current level throughout this year, according to Joe Davis, Vanguard's chief global economist. The investment giant recently raised its base-line outlook for the U.S. economy to see no recession in 2024, but it also raised its forecast slightly for underlying inflation trends.
Across the Pacific, the Bank of Japan will announce its latest decision on interest rates on Tuesday. It's been keeping rates below zero in hopes of goosing the economy and inflation. Speculation is rising that wages for Japanese workers are rising enough for the Bank of Japan to finally move rates higher.
Across the Atlantic, the Bank of England will announce its decision on rates later in the week.
On Wall Street, Nvidia rose 0.7 percent after paring an earlier, bigger gain as it kicked off its annual conference for developers.
A frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology on Wall Street has sent the stocks of Nvidia and other players zooming so high that critics call it a bubble. Nvidia has grown into the U.S. stock market's third-largest stock.
Other Big Tech stocks also pushed the S&P 500 upward to snap a three-day losing streak, its longest in more than two months. Alphabet rallied 4.6 percent, and Tesla jumped 6.3 percent to trim its loss for the year so far.
On the losing end of Wall Street was Hertz Global Holdings, which skidded 6.2 percent to bring its loss for the year to 31.6 percent. Its chair and chief executive, Stephen Scherr, will resign at the end of March. The company named Wayne "Gil" West as its chief executive. He's a former executive at Cruise, the self-driving car company, and at Delta Air Lines.
Trading was mixed on Wall Street, and the smaller stocks in the Russell 2000 index slipped 0.7 percent.
Boeing sank by an additional 1.5 percent to bring its loss for the year to 31 percent. It has been struggling with concerns about its manufacturing quality, and its latest negative headline came on Friday. Workers found a panel missing on an older Boeing 737-800 after it arrived at its destination in Oregon from San Francisco.
In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury yield rose to 4.33 percent from 4.31 percent late Friday.
In stock markets abroad, Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped 2.7 percent. Shares of both Nissan Motor and Honda Motor Co. climbed after the two agreed on a partnership in electric vehicles.

Wrong Turns Doom Efforts On Apple Car: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Internal disagreements over the direction of the Apple car led the effort to sputter for years before it was canceled this week.
For the last decade, many Apple employees working on the company's secretive car project, internally code-named Titan, had a less flattering name for it: the Titanic disaster. They knew the project was likely to fail.
Throughout its existence, the car effort was scrapped and rebooted several times, shedding hundreds of workers along the way. As a result of dueling views among leaders about what an Apple car should be, it began as an electric vehicle that would compete against Tesla and morphed into a self-driving car to rival Google's Waymo.
By the time of its death -- Tuesday, when executives announced internally that the project was being killed and that many members of the team were being reassigned to work on artificial intelligence -- Apple had burned more than $ 10 billion on the project and the car had reverted to its beginnings as an electric vehicle with driving-assistance features rivaling Tesla's, according to a half dozen people who worked on the project over the past decade.
The car project's demise was a testament to the way Apple has struggled to develop new products in the years since Steve Jobs's death in 2011. The effort had four different leaders and conducted multiple rounds of layoffs. But it festered and ultimately fizzled in large part because developing the software and algorithms for a car with autonomous driving features proved too difficult.
Apple declined to comment.
"When it started, it was aligning the stars on something Apple alone could hit a home run on," said Bryant Walker Smith, an associate professor at the schools of law and engineering at the University of South Carolina, who spoke to Apple briefly about its project in 2015. "A decade later, the stars have realigned to make this a lot of risk and not a lot of gain."
When Apple launched its car project in 2014, it was among a stampede of investors, executives, engineers and companies chasing the idea of a self-driving car. After Google began testing prototypes on public roads in California, voices across Silicon Valley insisted that autonomous vehicles would soon be commonplace. Apple didn't want to be left behind.
At the time, the company was dealing with questions from its top engineers about its next project, according to three people familiar with the project's origins. It had just finished the Apple Watch, and many engineers were restless to begin work on something new. Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, approved the project in part to prevent an exodus of engineers to Tesla.
Apple also needed to find new ways to expand its business. The company was anticipating that sales of iPhones would slow in the coming years. Cars were part of a $ 2 trillion transportation industry that could help Apple, which by then was a nearly $ 200 billion business.
Despite having a vote of confidence from Apple's chief executive, members of the team knew they were working against harsh realities, according to the six employees familiar with the project. If it ever came to market, an Apple car was likely to cost at least $ 100,000 and still generate razor-thin profit compared with smartphones and earbuds. It would also arrive years after Tesla had dominated the market.
The company held some discussions with Elon Musk about acquiring Tesla, according to two people familiar with the talks. But ultimately, it decided that building its own car made more sense than buying and integrating another business.
Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.
From its inception, the project was troubled by differing views on what it should be, the people familiar with it said. Steve Zadesky, who initially led the effort, wanted to build an electric vehicle that competed with Tesla. Jony Ive, Apple's chief design officer, wanted to pursue a self-driving car, which members of the software team said could be done.
Apple, which by then had $ 155 billion in cash, spent lavishly to hire hundreds of people with experience in machine learning, a type of A.I. technology, and other capabilities crucial to making a self-driving car. The influx of people made the project among the first that Apple had developed with so many outsiders new to the company's culture.
The car team, composed of more than 2,000 employees by this year, included engineers who had worked for NASA and developed racecars for Porsche.
The group developed an array of new technologies, including a windshield that could display turn-by-turn directions and a sunroof that would feature special polymer to reduce heat from the sun.
To bolster morale and guidance, star executives like Mr. Ive and the head of Mac engineering, Bob Mansfield, got involved. The company acquired several start-ups to join the car team. In 2021, to steer the project toward success, Apple put Kevin Lynch, the executive behind its popular Apple Watch, in charge of the car.
Mr. Ive and his team of designers drew concepts for a car that would look like a European minivan such as the Fiat Multipla 600, which has a half-dozen windows and a curving roof. It had no steering wheel and would be controlled using Apple's virtual assistant, Siri.
One day, in the fall of 2015, Mr. Ive and Mr. Cook met at the project's headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif., for a demonstration of how the car might work. The two men sank into the seats of a cabinlike interior. Outside, a voice actor read from a script of what Siri would say as the men zoomed down the road in the imaginary car. Mr. Ive asked Siri what restaurant they passed and the actor read an answer, said two people familiar with the demonstration.
But by 2016, it was clear that the car effort was in trouble. Mr. Zadesky left Apple, and his successor, Mr. Mansfield, told the team working on the project that they would be shifting their focus from building a car to building self-driving car software, said three people familiar with the shift.
Apple secured permits from California to begin test-driving Lexus sport utility vehicles outfitted with sensors and computers. It held discussions with car makers such as BMW, Nissan and Mercedes-Benz before striking a deal with Volkswagen to provide Transporter vans for self-driving shuttles on Apple's campus.
Two more leaders took over the car effort in the years that followed. Doug Field, a former Tesla executive, laid off more than 200 employees on the project as he leaned into efforts to build its self-driving system. Then Mr. Lynch, who succeeded him in recent years, reversed the company's plans and went back to its original idea of making an electric vehicle.
Mr. Mansfield and Mr. Field didn't respond to requests for comment.
At the start of this year, Apple's leadership decided that it was a better use of the company's time to work on generative A.I. rather than the car, the company told employees in an internal meeting on Tuesday. The company said some members of the Project Titan team would be reassigned to work on artificial intelligence.
In interviews on Wednesday with The New York Times, people who worked on the project praised the decision to shutter it, saying the technology behind generative A.I. could be invaluable to the future of the company's all-important iPhone business.
Apple's dead car project will be survived by its underlying technologies. The company plans to take what it has learned about artificial intelligence and automation and apply it to other technologies that are being researched, including A.I.-powered AirPods with cameras, robot assistants and augmented reality, according to three people briefed on the projects.
Though the engineers working on automation software will get to work on artificial intelligence projects, others on the car team have been told they will need to apply for different roles at the company.

Honda Earnings Grow,
Bolstered by U.S. Demand
The Japanese automaker Honda's profit rose 3.5 percent in the October-December quarter from a year earlier on the back of solid demand in the U.S. and Europe and a recovery in its home market, the company said Thursday.
Honda Motor Co.'s profit in the last quarter was 253.3 billion yen, or $ 1.7 billion. Quarterly sales jumped 21 percent to 5.39 trillion yen, or $ 36 billion.
All the automakers have been hurt by shortages of computer chips and other parts, partly because of pandemic-related disruptions in manufacturing.
Japanese automakers including Honda have lagged in the global push toward pure electric vehicles, partly because of their strength in other green models such as hybrids and fuel cells.
Over the first nine months of the fiscal year, Honda sold 3.1 million vehicles, up from 2.7 million vehicles the previous year, with sales especially strong in the U.S. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Nissan Profit Stumbles
As China Sales Decline
Nissan said Thursday that its profit sank in October-December to about half of earnings the year before, though it stuck to earlier earnings forecasts.
Nissan Motor Co. reported its profit was 29 billion yen, or $ 195 million, in the last quarter, down from 50.6 billion yen a year earlier.
Quarterly sales jumped nearly 10 percent to 3.1 trillion yen, $ 21 billion, for the maker of the Leaf electric car, Infiniti luxury models and Z sports cars.
Market conditions were especially difficult in China, said Stephen Ma, Nissan's chief financial officer. The Chinese auto market remains intensely competitive amid a price war between manufacturers.
Nissan's vehicle sales in China plunged 35 percent in April-December from the previous year. Nissan sales rose about 30 percent in the U.S. from a year earlier, helping to offset the China woes. ASSOCIATED PRESS
CORPORATE MOVES
Ex-Tesla Executive Hired
By G.M. in Batteries Role
General Motors has hired a former Tesla executive, Kurt Kelty, to serve in the newly created role of vice president of batteries as the automaker continues to work on its electric vehicle strategy.
G.M. is still seeing strong demand for its E.V. products. The company expects E.V. losses to ease this year and hit low- to mid-single-digit profit margins in 2025 as it adds more E.V.s to its lineup.
Mr. Kelty will be charged with G.M.'s battery cell strategy and a new end-to-end approach. This will include the use of raw materials, research, developing and investing in new technology, commercialization of cells and packs, and end of life opportunities.
Mr. Kelty most recently served as vice president at Sila. Before that, he led the Tesla battery development team for 11 years. He was a key driver in the creation of Tesla's first gigafactory, the largest lithium-ion battery and E.V. component factory in the world. ASSOCIATED PRESS

A Tenuous Crypto Empire Comes Crumbling Down: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: With its streamlined curves and glow-in-the-dark sound system, the silver Lamborghini Huracán Performante was the stuff of teenage fantasy: $ 350,000 of aerodynamic metals and lightweight upholstery, packed into a taut and powerful body. Ben Armstrong loved it dearly.
When he started shopping for a Lamborghini, Mr. Armstrong, a cryptocurrency evangelist with more than one million YouTube subscribers, worried that he'd have to spend months searching. "I think I have to go to Italy to get the Lambo I want," he texted a business partner. "I don't want to compromise." But fate smiled on him. In the fall of 2021, a car dealership in Charlotte, N.C., shipped the Huracán to Mr. Armstrong's production studio in an Atlanta suburb.
As the Lamborghini was lowered from a delivery truck, Mr. Armstrong, better known by the nom de crypto BitBoy, let out a joyful laugh. "I may have shed a tear," he said at the time.
Back then, BitBoy was one of the most popular figures in the wild, scam-ridden world of crypto influencers. Cultivating a persona as a straight-talking everyman, he filmed a livestream five days a week in which he lectured his hundreds of thousands of listeners on the virtues of experimental coins with names like Polkadot or XRP. He said that regulators were fools, and that digital money offered a path to upward mobility. The Lamborghini was vivid proof: Crypto would make you rich and cool and successful.
Two years later, Mr. Armstrong, 41, has lost his production company and much of his wealth. His friends have turned on him, and his wife has filed for divorce. Over the last five months, across countless social media posts and videos, Mr. Armstrong has claimed to be the victim of a "criminal conspiracy" by "terrorists" who took over his YouTube channel. "BitBoy is dead," he recently declared.
The trouble started in August when Mr. Armstrong was unceremoniously ousted from his company, HIT Network, by a group of his friends and business partners. Since then, the schism has expanded into a wide-ranging scandal: In court and on social media, the various antagonists have traded allegations of extortion, theft, sexual harassment and workplace violence. An extramarital affair has sparked particularly heated recriminations. And the Lamborghini is gone.
"I'm going through a midlife crisis," Mr. Armstrong said in one of several recent interviews. "A spiritual crisis."
In the good times, BitBoy's rise to YouTube stardom was propelled by the same cultural forces that turned crypto into a multitrillion-dollar sensation. With swaggering confidence, he spun a get-rich-quick narrative that held enormous appeal at a moment when clever memes were driving millions of dollars in deal-making and crypto was hyped in Super Bowl commercials.
That era has ended. The dramatic collapse of Mr. Armstrong's empire mirrors the arc of the industry -- a once-high-flying sector now tarred by scandal and teetering on the edge of mainstream relevance. As crypto crashed over the last two years, millions of people lost savings, their digital riches erased practically overnight. Most of that wealth, they learned, was never real to begin with.
Crypto Shock Jock
Like any charismatic salesman, Mr. Armstrong has a carefully honed pitch: He used to be just a regular guy, he likes to say, until crypto changed his life. After undergoing treatment for a methamphetamine addiction in the early 2000s, he attended a Christian college and ended up marrying his admissions counselor. For a few years, he dabbled in a variety of businesses -- from graphic design to a carwash he helped run -- before settling on the volatile crypto markets.
He started making videos in 2017, mostly low-tech monologues about crypto news, but his channel didn't take off until three years later, when a boom in prices attracted millions of amateur traders who were looking for advice.
During the pandemic, Mr. Armstrong upgraded to a professional studio and hired a small staff to produce slick, professionally edited videos. His investment portfolio was surging: At the market's peak, he has said, he had about $ 40 million of crypto. But the line between his personal finances and the corporate accounts was blurry: Most of those assets technically belonged to BJ Investment Holdings, a company that he owned with T.J. Shedd, a fellow crypto enthusiast who managed the production business.
If crypto is the Wild West of finance, then crypto influencers inhabit the wildest stretch of that frontier. The top YouTubers -- veering between earnest soliloquies about the Federal Reserve's rate cuts and impassioned endorsements of coins named after cartoon animals -- command huge audiences and hold sway over the types of obsessively online day traders who drove the so-called meme stock frenzy in 2021. Competition for viewership is fierce. The result is something like a cross between professional wrestling and CNBC: a loose community of self-promoters, feuding over who offers the best financial advice.
Popular shows can generate big money. Crypto companies pay influencers millions of dollars to promote financial products on platforms like YouTube, TikTok and Telegram. In 2023, Mr. Armstrong signed a contract worth $ 1 million a month with the gambling company Stake, which lets users wager crypto in casino-style games.
"This is the business of entertainment," said Aj Pleasanton, a crypto YouTuber who worked with Mr. Armstrong at HIT Network. "It's not always about who has the best factual information. It's not always about who has the best alpha on trading. It's about who has the best story."
In the crowded field of crypto shock jocks, Mr. Armstrong carved out a niche as the loudest and most aggressive. He often wore a bright-green Gucci tracksuit, and liked to brag about his success in the market. He encouraged his viewers to invest in a slew of crypto products, including at least one offered by a company that later collapsed, and predicted that Bitcoin would rise to $ 300,000 by the end of 2021. (It didn't.)
But while fans would mob him at industry conferences, Mr. Armstrong was often criticized for promoting coins that crashed in value and accepting payments from crypto companies, including one sponsorship he admitted wasn't properly disclosed.
"Let's be clear. I'm not going to prison," he wrote on Reddit in 2022. "Maybe some fine one day based on shifting security laws." (The Securities and Exchange Commission has brought a series of cases against influencers who advertised risky crypto investments without revealing that they were compensated for the promotion.)
As the crypto market cratered in 2022, Mr. Armstrong pivoted to an unlikely new persona -- cop on the beat. Months before the FTX crypto exchange collapsed, he posted a series of tweets and videos excoriating Sam Bankman-Fried, the company's now-disgraced founder, calling him a "fox in the crypto henhouse" who was plotting to destroy rival start-ups. Mr. Bankman-Fried circulated a fact sheet claiming that BitBoy's negativity was part of a scheme by industry competitors to spread misinformation about FTX.
After FTX folded that November, Mr. Armstrong flew to the Bahamas with a camera crew and tried to sneak around Mr. Bankman-Fried's luxury apartment complex there. "I killed this man's whole career," he declared. "We saved crypto in America."
But it was also around then that friends and colleagues started to worry about changes in Mr. Armstrong's behavior, according to interviews. BitBoy wasn't an act. The recovered addict turned Christian family man had become unrecognizable in his personal life. Soaking in the adulation of his fans, Mr. Armstrong was now a parody of a crypto bro -- a guy who spent a lot of time thinking about Lamborghinis.
"Ben lost track of the person he used to be," Mr. Shedd, his former business partner, said in a statement. "He caused enormous damage to both his professional and personal relationships."
Last spring, as the crypto market struggled to rebound, Mr. Armstrong started promoting a new cryptocurrency, BEN Coin, which he was developing with Cassandra Wolfe, a HIT Network contractor known on social media as the Duchess of DeFi. Ms. Wolfe, 34, once an aspiring influencer herself, had helped secure the lucrative Stake sponsorship, but Mr. Armstrong's staff thought BEN Coin was a bad idea. They worried that it was an obviously cynical money grab and didn't want him to promote the venture on the BitBoy YouTube channel.
At the same time, Mr. Shedd was starting to hear other worrisome stories about his business partner. In a September lawsuit, he accused Mr. Armstrong of "unlawfully directing and diverting" as much as $ 50,000 a month to Ms. Wolfe, with whom he was having an extramarital affair. Mr. Armstrong had also stolen tens of thousands of dollars in crypto from the firm, the complaint said, including several digital collectibles known as NFTs. Mr. Shedd triggered a clause in the holding company's operating agreement that allowed him to buy out Mr. Armstrong's majority stake.
Mr. Armstrong contested the claims and filed a series of lawsuits challenging the buyout; he argued that the payments to Ms. Wolfe were perfectly legal, and that the missing NFTs belonged to him. But his world was collapsing. The legal fight, which is still unfolding, turned up numerous allegations of misconduct: Mr. Armstrong had been abusing steroids, one suit said, and had engaged in a range of inappropriate and sometimes violent behavior at the office, from sexual harassment to "throwing filled bottles of protein shake" at staff. (Mr. Armstrong has denied the accusations.)
Then came the ultimate blow. In September, a crypto investor named Carlos Diaz, who moved in the same social circles as the HIT Network executives, asked Mr. Armstrong to sign over the title to the Lamborghini. Mr. Diaz was a onetime BitBoy superfan. "There was a spiritual connection," he said in an interview. "I really felt like this was God talking to me through him."
How exactly Mr. Diaz ended up asking his spiritual guide for a $ 350,000 sports car remains the subject of considerable legal dispute. Mr. Diaz said he had lost money on a large investment in BEN Coin, whose value had plummeted, and wanted to sell the car to recoup the funds. Mr. Armstrong insists that Mr. Diaz presented himself as an agent of HIT Network who was helping the company raise money. In any case, Mr. Armstrong said, he felt physically threatened and wanted to reach some kind of settlement.
BitBoy's two-year tenure as a Lamborghini owner ended in a Walmart parking lot, where he met Mr. Diaz to complete the paperwork.
'The Duke and the Duchess'
In the volatile world of crypto, a YouTuber's stock can rise and fall as erratically as any cartoon-inspired meme coin. By December, Mr. Armstrong was attempting a comeback. With Ms. Wolfe by his side, he flew to Las Vegas to announce his participation in "influencer fight club" -- a crypto-themed boxing event scheduled for February in Mexico City.
One evening, Mr. Armstrong mingled with Ms. Wolfe and a few other crypto influencers on the patio of Gold Spike, the downtown bar where he was promoting the event. Mostly he wanted to talk about the missing Lambo.
"It's in a showroom in Fort Lauderdale," he explained to his friends, including a YouTuber known as Crypto Keeper. "I have photos."
As the conversation turned to less exciting topics, Mr. Armstrong pulled Ms. Wolfe close and stroked her hair. Crypto Keeper leaned over to whisper in Mr. Armstrong's ear.
"The duke and the duchess," he said. Mr. Armstrong grinned. "The duke and the duchess," he repeated.
Behind the scenes, BitBoy's problems were mounting. He was streaming again on a new YouTube channel, Ben Armstrong Crypto, shorn of the old BitBoy branding, but viewers had reacted to his downfall with a mix of amusement and schadenfreude. "He is all that is cringe about crypto," a columnist for the industry outlet CoinDesk wrote.
Mr. Armstrong was also under growing legal pressure. He had lost many of his assets and had spent more than $ 150,000 on lawyers since the summer. Back in Georgia, three male employees at HIT Network had gone to the local authorities to accuse him of touching them sexually, including by grabbing them in the crotch or rear end, according to police reports reviewed by The New York Times.
Mr. Armstrong acknowledged that his studio had a "locker room" environment; he blamed his old colleagues for never hiring a human-resources officer. But he denied harassing anyone, and he hasn't been charged.
After the exposure of his affair, Mr. Armstrong released a video in which he and his wife, who have three young children, pledged to work through the crisis and keep their family together. For a while, Mr. Armstrong thought both women would support him: At an early hearing in his lawsuit against HIT Network, he sat in the courtroom with Ms. Wolfe on one side of him and his wife, Bethany, on the other.
Then, in October, Ms. Armstrong filed for divorce. Court records show that she has hired a forensic accountant to assess the size of her husband's crypto holdings.
Mr. Armstrong denies concealing any funds. But he is defiant about the affair with Ms. Wolfe. "I like her better than my wife," he said. "Not to be too crass, but we have a really, really great relationship." (A lawyer for Ms. Armstrong said she "looks forward to presenting her side of these events in court, if it leads to that.")
Since the summer, Ms. Wolfe has been working with Mr. Armstrong to rebuild his fan base and fight for control of his company. Before she got interested in crypto, she considered law school, she said, and ran a small clinic for people who wanted to represent themselves in court -- mostly men in divorce cases.
Ms. Wolfe, who has been married and divorced four times, met Mr. Armstrong at a conference in 2022 as she was trying to make her way in the crypto industry. A few months later, an astrologer she had found on the gig work site Fiverr told her that someone was about to "change the trajectory" of her career.
"Based on the eclipse degree, she's like, 'You know this person, but you don't know about the opportunity,"' Ms. Wolfe recalled. "She was talking about him."
In Las Vegas in December, Mr. Armstrong and Ms. Wolfe got matching tattoos of the BEN Coin logo, a series of intersecting arrows illustrating the currency's slogan, "Be Everywhere Now." Ms. Wolfe said BEN Coin was a serious enterprise, a way to encourage people to dabble in crypto. She and Mr. Armstrong are working on a deal to offer the coin in specialized A.T.M.s plastered with photos of BitBoy, teeth clenched, raising his fist in defiance.
But even as he talked up his future, Mr. Armstrong couldn't help lingering on the past. Nearly every conversation in Las Vegas circled back to the same long-winded theories about the manifold ways he was betrayed and the simmering jealousies that might have motivated the scheme to dethrone him.
Mr. Shedd always acted as if his sports car, a Nissan GT-R, was "better than my Lamborghini," Mr. Armstrong complained. "I didn't even know what a GT-R was until he bought it."
'He Stole My Lamborghini'
A week later, the duke and duchess returned to court. Mr. Armstrong had begun the day with a series of posts accusing another prominent influencer of joining a "pedophile ring" in Thailand. "Ben is on one this morning," Ms. Wolfe said as she stopped at a Starbucks near the courthouse in Marietta, Ga.
Mr. Armstrong has sued half a dozen of his old colleagues. But the most personal battle involves his Lamborghini -- the symbol of his success as a YouTuber and crypto's potential to generate life-changing riches. In court filings in Georgia, Mr. Armstrong has argued that he was bullied and extorted into transferring the car's title to Mr. Diaz, the BEN Coin investor.
In September, Mr. Armstrong had driven to Mr. Diaz's home outside Atlanta, bringing a gun. Looking disheveled in a sleeveless shirt, he stood on the street and started to livestream a rant about the missing vehicle.
"This man is extorting me," Mr. Armstrong told the police after they arrived to intervene. "He stole my Lamborghini."
Now he was preparing to argue that case in a Cobb County courtroom.
Under cross-examination by Mr. Diaz's lawyer, Mr. Armstrong answered a series of questions about the Lamborghini. Everyone agreed that the title to the car had been in his name, but Mr. Armstrong wasn't sure whether the payment for it had come from his personal funds or his company's accounts. He said he had been frightened of Mr. Diaz, and only reluctantly signed over the title.
Mr. Diaz's lawyer asked about the livestream incident, which led to Mr. Armstrong's arrest on still-pending misdemeanor charges.
"Did you repeatedly scream, 'Carlos, Carlos, I'm not afraid of you anymore, Carlos'?" he inquired.
After about two hours, Judge Jana Edmondson-Cooper ruled in favor of Mr. Diaz. An extortion case requires the misappropriation of someone's property, and the judge concluded that Mr. Armstrong had failed to prove the vehicle was "not a company car."
The Lamborghini of BitBoy's dreams had never belonged to him in the first place. Mr. Armstrong slammed his hand on the table. "The judge is corrupt," he said as he marched onto the elevator. Two members of his legal team exchanged looks; their client had a track record of intemperate posting. "Take his phone," one of them told Ms. Wolfe.
BitBoy was wounded. He wasn't getting the car back. Screenshots from the arrest video were providing grist for endless memes. And the new channel was languishing at 90,000 subscribers, a tiny fraction of the 1.5 million who had followed BitBoy at his peak.
"There's no win ever for me," Mr. Armstrong fumed as he stormed away from the courthouse.
But the old bravado was back before long. After a few days, BitBoy -- like everyone in the crypto world -- was looking toward the next big opportunity, the day prices would surge again.
"I'm a very complex, misunderstood person," he said. "I'm going to be rich again. Everybody kind of sees that. It's just a matter of how and when."

100 Names, And Legacies, Lift Lahaina As It Rebuilds: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Authorities have identified the last known person to have died in the wildfire. Young and old, those lost won't be forgotten.
Terri Thomas was a beloved aunt who loved outdoor adventures. Po'omaika'i Estores-Losano, a musician and father, was trying to rebuild his life. Tony Takafua, 7 years old, had barely begun his.
Buddy Jantoc, a grandfather, was among the first to be identified. And Lydia Coloma, 70, was the last.
They were among the 100 known victims of the wildfire that tore through Lahaina on the island of Maui in Hawaii on Aug. 8. The identification of Ms. Coloma on Friday brought to a quiet close the somber task by authorities of identifying individuals believed to have died in the blaze.
"Our hearts go out to the families, friends and community affected by this devastating event," Maui officials said in the news release announcing the identification of the 100th fatality.
Ms. Coloma was the ninth member of her family to have been identified as a fatal victim of the wildfire, according to the Honolulu Civil Beat.
The news came almost two months after the authorities had last identified a victim. And as of Friday, three people were still unaccounted for or missing after the fire, according to Maui officials.
More than two-thirds of the deceased were older than 60 years old. They included Alfredo Galinato, 79, who died trying to save his longtime family home, and Louise Abihai, the oldest at 97, who was one of several victims in the Hale Mahaolu Eono senior housing complex.
Three of the victims were under 18, including Justin Recolizado, 11, and 7-year-old Tony, the youngest.
Tony loved football and video games, and enjoyed riding electric bikes with his cousins. On Aug. 8, he was with his mother, Salote Tone, who adored her "Boobear."
The two of them tried to escape the fire along with her parents, Faaoso and Maluifonua Tone, in their Honda Civic, but they did not survive. Salote's brother Folau Tone was driving a Nissan truck through the flames with his four children. He has struggled with the weight of wondering why his car made it out but his sister's did not.
For Laurie Allen, the fight for survival lasted weeks. Ms. Allen, 65, loved snorkeling and kayaking and was known for showing compassion to homeless residents. She managed to escape the inferno on foot, though she suffered third-degree burns on more than 70 percent of her skin. Ms. Allen underwent a series of surgeries and skin grafts at a burn center in Honolulu. Seven weeks after the fire, she succumbed to her injuries.
"There are no words to express how deeply I will miss her," her husband, Perry Allen, told The Times in a text message after her death. Identifying the dead has been a colossal undertaking, involving DNA samples from family members and dental experts. At one point, officials had said that 115 people had died. At another, the toll was believed to be 97. In some cases, there were multiple sets of remains for one person. In others, remains turned out to be nonhuman.
All but two of the 100 were from Lahaina. George Hall III was from Kahului, another town on the island. And Theresa Cook was from California. She was staying at a hotel in Lahaina and was scheduled to return to Sacramento on Aug. 9. The work of rebuilding Lahaina is underway. The fire burned through more than 2,000 buildings, leaving little more than cinder blocks, car husks and piles of ash behind. But crews have started clearing plots of land, with excavators digging down six inches to remove contaminated soil.
To locals, the memory of the 100 will always be part of the rebirth. In September, during a day of vigils for those lost in the fire, some 300 Maui residents gathered in the quad on the campus of the University of Hawaii, Maui College.
Spiritual leaders, or kahu, offered individual prayers during the hourlong ceremony. One, Kahu Kale Kaalekahi, told the crowd that everyone's grief "makes us all kin" and that it would be a unifying force in the island's recovery.
"It is in the brokenness that shapes us," he said.

Full text: A reshuffle brought in a handful of new ministers, including a high-profile conservative and a Europe-focused foreign minister. But several key officials remained.
President Emmanuel Macron of France convened a new, smaller cabinet for the first time on Friday, a day after a government reshuffle that brought in a handful of new ministers -- including one poached from the right and a Europe-focused foreign minister -- but that left most key positions untouched.
"A united government," Mr. Macron said before camera crews were ushered out ahead of the cabinet meeting, which was held in a noticeably smaller room than usual. "Let's get to work."
Many of the 14 ministers around the table were longtime pillars of Mr. Macron's government. Gérald Darmanin, Mr. Macron's tough-talking interior minister; Bruno Le Maire, his perennial economy minister; and Sébastien Lecornu, the defense minister -- all former members of the mainstream conservative party-- have remained in place. Éric Dupond-Moretti, the justice minister, who was recently cleared in an abuse-of-power case, stayed as well.
Mr. Macron signaled a focus on Europe by appointing Stéphane Séjourné, a top ally of the French leader in the European Parliament, as foreign minister. A vote for European Parliament seats scheduled in June is expected to be a hard battle against the French far right, given that the National Rally came ahead in vote percentages in the last election in 2019.
The new cabinet was announced on Thursday evening just days after Mr. Macron appointed Gabriel Attal, 34, as the new prime minister, an attempt to reinvigorate his second term after a year of successful, but politically bruising, pension and immigration overhauls.
The new cabinet includes fewer of the little-known technocrats or members of civil society that Mr. Macron has sometimes favored in the past. Instead, it includes more veteran politicians, many of them on the right, continuing a yearslong shift in that direction by Mr. Macron.
Mr. Attal, France's youngest and first openly gay prime minister, rejected criticism that Mr. Macron was reneging on the promise that he made when he was first elected in 2017 to transcend the country's left-right political divide.
"What I want is action, action, action, and results, results, results," Mr. Attal told TF1 television on Thursday night.
"I'm not here to ask my ministers to empty their pockets to show me what political party card they carry," Mr. Attal added. "What I'm interested in is having ministers who want to address French people's problems."
The most unexpected announcement was the appointment of Rachida Dati as culture minister. Ms. Dati is a high-profile, outspoken conservative with little prior cultural expertise who served as justice minister from 2007 to 2009 under former President Nicolas Sarkozy and is currently the mayor of the Seventh Arrondissement of Paris. She is also under investigation in a corruption case involving Carlos Ghosn, the disgraced former chief executive of the car manufacturers Nissan and Renault.
Ms. Dati had been extremely critical of Mr. Macron in the past, calling his party a collection of "traitors from the left and traitors from the right." She was expelled from her party, the right-wing Republicans, after her appointment on Thursday.
Ms. Dati's predecessor, Rima Abdul Malak, was publicly rebuked by Mr. Macron last month over the fate of Gérard Depardieu, the French actor who is facing renewed scrutiny over sexual assault accusations.
Ms. Abdul Malak had said that disciplinary proceedings would determine whether Mr. Depardieu should lose his Legion of Honor, France's highest award, over sexist comments that he made in a television documentary. But Mr. Macron has staunchly defended the actor, condemning the "manhunt" against him.
"I remained free, free in my commitments, free in the positions I took," Ms. Abdul Malak said on Friday before handing the ministry over to Ms. Dati.
Clément Beaune, formerly a top Macron protégé leading the transportation ministry, was also left out of the new cabinet. That was widely perceived as a punishment for his reported role as ringleader of a short-lived rebellion among left-leaning ministers, who balked at the government's compromises with the right on the tough immigration overhaul.
The new foreign minister, Mr. Séjourné, is not a career diplomat but he was the longtime leader of Renew Europe, a group of European liberals in the European Parliament. He is also the secretary general of Mr. Macron's centrist Renaissance Party in France, and he is Mr. Attal's former partner.
"The advent of Europe will be my priority," Mr. Séjourné said at a joint news conference on Friday with his predecessor, Catherine Colonna.
While the new cabinet, excluding Mr. Attal, has an equal number of men and women, Ms. Colonna's departure means that the most powerful ministries are now all held by men.
The team is also much smaller than Mr. Macron's previous cabinet, which ballooned to about 40 members. He achieved this partly by merging some responsibilities.
Catherine Vautrin, a right-wing politician from Reims who became the new labor minister, will also be in charge of health. Amélie Oudéa-Castéra, who was formerly in charge of sports, is now also leading France's large education ministry -- in addition to overseeing preparations for the upcoming Summer Olympics.
Several junior positions will be filled in the coming days to support and supplement the fully fledged ministers, Mr. Macron's office said. But labor unions representing teachers and health professionals quickly expressed doubts that they would have the undivided attention of their new overseers.
"Does this mean that national education is going to be stuck between beach volleyball and hammer throwing?" Sophie Vénétitay, the leader of one of the main teacher unions, said on Franceinfo radio.

Full text: After almost 10 years of marriage, Christine Dowdall wanted out. Her husband was no longer the charming man she had fallen in love with. He had become narcissistic, abusive and unfaithful, she said. After one of their fights turned violent in September 2022, Ms. Dowdall, a real estate agent, fled their home in Covington, La., driving her Mercedes-Benz C300 sedan to her daughter's house near Shreveport, five hours away. She filed a domestic abuse report with the police two days later.
Her husband, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent, didn't want to let her go. He called her repeatedly, she said, first pleading with her to return, and then threatening her. She stopped responding to him, she said, even though he texted and called her hundreds of times.
Ms. Dowdall, 59, started occasionally seeing a strange new message on the display in her Mercedes, about a location-based service called "mbrace." The second time it happened, she took a photograph and searched for the name online.
"I realized, oh my God, that's him tracking me," Ms. Dowdall said.
"Mbrace" was part of "Mercedes me" -- a suite of connected services for the car, accessible via a smartphone app. Ms. Dowdall had only ever used the Mercedes Me app to make auto loan payments. She hadn't realized that the service could also be used to track the car's location. One night, when she visited a male friend's home, her husband sent the man a message with a thumbs-up emoji. A nearby camera captured his car driving in the area, according to the detective who worked on her case.
Ms. Dowdall called Mercedes customer service repeatedly to try to remove her husband's digital access to the car, but the loan and title were in his name, a decision the couple had made because he had a better credit score than hers. Even though she was making the payments, had a restraining order against her husband and had been granted sole use of the car during divorce proceedings, Mercedes representatives told her that her husband was the customer so he would be able to keep his access. There was no button she could press to take away the app's connection to the vehicle.
"This is not the first time that I've heard something like this," one of the representatives told Ms. Dowdall.
A spokeswoman for Mercedes-Benz said the company did not comment on "individual customer matters."
A car, to its driver, can feel like a sanctuary. A place to sing favorite songs off key, to cry, to vent or to drive somewhere no one knows you're going.
But in truth, there are few places in our lives less private.
Modern cars have been called "smartphones with wheels" because they are internet-connected and have myriad methods of data collection, from cameras and seat weight sensors to records of how hard you brake and corner. Most drivers don't realize how much information their cars are collecting and who has access to it, said Jen Caltrider, a privacy researcher at Mozilla who reviewed the privacy policies of more than 25 car brands and found surprising disclosures, such as Nissan saying it might collect information about "sexual activity."
"People think their car is private," Ms. Caltrider said. "With a computer, you know where the camera is and you can put tape over it. Once you've bought a car and you find it is bad at privacy, what are you supposed to do?"
Privacy advocates are concerned by how car companies are using and sharing consumers' data -- with insurance companies, for example -- and drivers' inability to turn the data collection off. California's privacy regulator is investigating the auto industry.
For car owners, the upside of this data-palooza has come in the form of smartphone apps that allow them to check a car's location when, say, they forget where it is parked; to lock and unlock the vehicle remotely; and to turn it on or off. Some apps can even remotely set the car's climate controls, make the horn honk or turn on its lights. After setting up the app, the car's owner can grant access to a limited number of other drivers.
Domestic violence experts say that these convenience features are being weaponized in abusive relationships, and that car makers have not been willing to assist victims. This is particularly complicated when the victim is a co-owner of the car, or not named on the title.
Detective Kelly Downey of the Bossier Parish Sheriff's Office, who investigated Ms. Dowdall's husband for stalking, also reached out to Mercedes more than a dozen times to no avail, she said. She had previously dealt with another case of harassment via a connected car app -- a woman whose husband would turn on her Lexus while it sat in the garage in the middle of the night. In that case, too, Detective Downey was unable to get the car company to turn off the husband's access; the victim sold her car.
"Automobile manufacturers have to create a way for us to stop it," Detective Downey said. "Technology may be our godsend, but it's also very scary because it could hurt you."
Mercedes also failed to respond to a search warrant, Detective Downey said. She instead found evidence that the husband was using the Mercedes Me app by obtaining records of his internet activity.
Unable to get help from Mercedes, Ms. Dowdall took her car to an independent mechanic this year and paid $ 400 to disable the remote tracking. This also disabled the car's navigation system and its S.O.S. button, a tool to get help in an emergency.
"I didn't care. I just didn't want him to know where I was," said Ms. Dowdall, whose husband died by suicide last month. "Car manufacturers should give the ability to turn this tracking off."
Eva Galperin, an expert on tech-enabled domestic abuse at the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that she has seen another case of an abuser using a car app to track a victim's movements, and that the victim didn't realize it because she "isn't the one who has set it up."
"As far as I know, there are not any guides for how to lock your partner out of your car after you break up," Ms. Galperin said.
Controlling partners have tracked their victims' cars in the past using GPS devices and Apple AirTags, Ms. Galperin said, but connected car apps offer new opportunities for harassment.
A San Francisco man used his remote access to the Tesla Model X sport utility vehicle he co-owned with his wife to harass her after they separated, according to a lawsuit she filed anonymously in San Francisco Superior Court in 2020. (Reuters previously reported on the case.)
According to a legal complaint against her husband and Tesla, the car's lights and horns were activated in a parking garage. On hot days, she would arrive at her car and discover the heat was running so that it was uncomfortably hot, while on cold days, she would find that the air-conditioner had been activated from afar. Her husband, she said in court documents, used the location-finding feature on the Tesla to identify her new residence, which she had hoped to keep secret from him.
The woman, who obtained a restraining order against her husband, contacted Tesla numerous times to get her husband's access to the car revoked -- she included some of the emails in legal filings -- but was not successful.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. In legal filings, Tesla denied responsibility for the harassment; questioned whether it had occurred, based on the husband's denials; and raised questions about the woman's reliability. (Some of what she claimed her husband had done, such as turning on songs with disturbing lyrics while she was driving, could not be done via the Tesla app.)
"Virtually every major automobile manufacturer offers a mobile app with similar functions for their customers," Tesla's lawyers wrote in a legal filing. "It is illogical and impractical to expect Tesla to monitor every vehicle owner's mobile app for misuse."
A judge dismissed Tesla from the case, stating that it would be "onerous" to expect car manufacturers to determine which claims of app abuse were legitimate.
Katie Ray-Jones, the chief executive of the National Domestic Violence Hotline, said abusive partners used a wide variety of internet-connected devices -- from laptops to smart home products -- to track and harass their victims. Technology that keep tabs on a person's movements is of particular concern to domestic violence shelters, she said, because they "try to keep the shelter location confidential."
As a preventative measure, Ms. Ray-Jones encourages people in relationships to have equal access to technologies used to control their homes and belongings.
"If there's an app that is controlling your automobile, you both need to have access to that," she said.
Adam Dodge, a former family law attorney turned digital safety trainer, called car app stalking "a blind spot for victims and automakers."
"Most victims I've talked to are wholly unaware that the car they rely on is app-connected in the first place," he said. "They can't address threats they don't know are there."
As a possible solution to the problem, he and other domestic violence experts pointed to the Safe Connections Act, a recent federal law that allows victims of domestic abuse to easily sever their phone from accounts shared with their abusers. A similar law should extend to cars, Mr. Dodge said, allowing people with protective orders from a court to easily cut off an abuser's digital access to their car.
"Having access to a car for a victim is a lifeline," he said. "No victim should have to make the choice between being stalked by the car or having no car. But that's the crossroads many of them find themselves at."

Full text: If companies want to leave Russia, the president is setting the terms -- in ways that benefit his government, his elites and his war.
Soon after Russian troops invaded his country, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, made a plea to Western companies: "Leave Russia," he said. "Make sure that the Russians do not receive a single penny."
Hundreds of companies answered the call. Politicians and activists predicted that it would help strangle the Russian economy and undermine the Kremlin's war effort.
President Vladimir V. Putin had other plans.
Mr. Putin has turned the exits of major Western companies into a windfall for Russia's loyal elite and the state itself. He has forced companies wishing to sell to do so at fire-sale prices. He has limited sales to buyers anointed by Moscow. Sometimes he has seized firms outright.
A New York Times investigation traced how Mr. Putin has turned an expected misfortune into an enrichment scheme. Western companies that have announced departures have declared more than $ 103 billion in losses since the start of the war, according to a Times analysis of financial reports. Mr. Putin has squeezed companies for as much of that wealth as possible by dictating the terms of their departure.
He has also subjected those exits to ever-increasing taxes, generating at least $ 1.25 billion in the past year for Russia's war chest.
No private deal is safe. The Dutch beer company Heineken, for example, found a buyer this spring and set a price. But the Russian government unilaterally rejected the deal, people close to the negotiations said, and put the company's Russian holdings in the hands of an aerosol-packaging titan married to a former Russian senator.
In all, Mr. Putin has overseen one of the biggest transfers of wealth within Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. Huge swaths of industries -- elevators, tires, industrial coatings and more -- are now in the hands of increasingly dominant Russian players.
In some cases, that player is the state. Government-owned enterprises have acquired the assets of corporate giants like Ikea and Toyota. In many cases, Mr. Putin personally signs off on sales.
"These are good deals for us, for sure," said Anton Pinsky, a prominent restaurateur who joined with a pro-Putin rapper and associates of a powerful senator to take over Starbucks. In an interview in Moscow, he downplayed the significance of his own deal but was clear about the effect of the Western departures.
"You screwed up, left it," he said. "We picked it up inexpensively. Thank you."
Today in Russia, a robust consumer world carries on, helping Mr. Putin maintain a sense of normalcy despite a war that has proved longer, deadlier and costlier than he predicted.
Most foreign companies remain in Russia, unwilling to lose the billions they've invested there over decades. Other businesses have been sold and now have a through-the-looking-glass feel. Krispy Kreme is now Krunchy Dream; its doughnuts come in a similar flat box with familiar flavors. Starbucks has been reborn as Stars Coffee. Its mermaid is now a Russian swan princess.
These companies can buy raw materials domestically or import them from friendly countries. And customers can still easily buy products that have supposedly been pulled from shelves. On a recent day, a Moscow supermarket offered Pepsi from Uzbekistan and Coca-Cola from Poland.
Mr. Putin's economic counterstrikes have helped to fortify support among the elites profiting from the war and to blunt the effects of Western isolation. While Ukraine is preoccupied with short-term imperatives like shoring up international support, the relative resilience of the Russian economy has enabled Mr. Putin to play a long game.
Previously undisclosed documents, financial statements and interviews with dozens of deal makers in Russia and across Europe -- many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution -- show that Moscow now micromanages practically every exit. Companies must navigate an opaque system to win approval to sell. In some cases, Mr. Putin's friends have appealed directly to him to intervene.
"Those who are leaving are losing their position," Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told The Times. "And of course, their property is being bought at a serious discount and taken over by our companies, which are doing it with pleasure."
Still, the wave of departing companies has stung. It has sent a global signal that Russia is a business pariah. The economy is strained and at risk of overheating. Mr. Putin's handling of Western departures has only reinforced Russia's image as a dangerous place to do business. Even some top Russian officials admit that decreased competition and foreign investment will hurt everyday Russians and the economy in the long term.
The Kremlin says it prefers that companies remain in Russia. But Mr. Putin scoffs at the notion that leaving will hurt. "Did they think everything would collapse here? Well, nothing of the kind happened," he said this month. "Russian companies took over and moved on."
Not every deal is a windfall. Some buyers will face steep obstacles to make their new businesses profitable.
Hanging over the exit process for Western firms is the threat of intimidation and force. The Russian authorities have investigated departing companies, interrogated workers and arrested local executives.
Last summer, Mr. Putin seized the Russian arm of the Danish brewer Carlsberg, along with roughly half a billion dollars in cash, and put them under the temporary control of one of his friends.
At least four other companies have similarly lost control of their operations this year to effective state seizures.
Today, Mr. Putin is at the helm of a fraught exit process that works to Russia's advantage. But it began in the early days of the war with the urgent goal of simply keeping the Russian economy alive.
Blocking the Exits
Speaking from the White House two weeks after the invasion, President Biden boasted that the West was crushing the Russian economy. "The list of businesses and international corporations leaving Russia is growing by the day," he said.
Things looked bleak for Mr. Putin. The stock exchange in Moscow was closed and the ruble had crashed. If Russia lost all the jobs, production and cash of Western companies, the effects would be devastating.
But Mr. Putin was preparing his financial rejoinder. He restricted the movement of money abroad and required that companies from "unfriendly nations" win approval before selling their businesses.
Mr. Putin was putting the brakes on just as Western executives faced pressure to accelerate. In the United States, there was perhaps no more vocal figure than the Yale University management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld. He appeared on cable news programs, criticizing companies that remained in Russia.
Professor Sonnenfeld recalled that it was corporate boycotts -- more than sanctions -- that helped abolish apartheid in South Africa. He transformed his office into a sort of war room, with a Yale team grading companies on their efforts to sever Russian ties.
The question of who would end up with those companies was of little concern.
"If Putin thinks he can do better at the deep fryer, let him have at it," he said in an interview. "We really don't care. The important thing is to not have the endorsement of a renowned global brand."
Professor Sonnenfeld's list and others like it added to pressure from shareholders, Ukrainian activists and everyday consumers.
Some executives worried what would happen to their Russian employees, factories and technology if they walked away. Others were reluctant to abandon their investments over a war that might prove short-lived.
But some quickly announced intentions to go. Heineken and Carlsberg said that they would leave once they found buyers. The Canadian gold mining company Kinross did the same, and within days announced a deal for $ 680 million to sell its Russian operation to a local buyer.
OBI, a German hardware store chain, went a step further, saying that it would close all 27 stores in Russia until it found a buyer.
Mr. Putin's government, though, was already erecting hurdles.
On March 17, 2022, the Russian Trade Ministry sent a letter to local OBI managers. The letter, reviewed by The Times, urged managers to defy the company and keep the stores open, citing consumer-protection laws. There was no "economic reason" for closing, the ministry wrote.
OBI, the ministry warned, needed to fulfill "obligations to its consumers, workers and counterparties, including suppliers." That prompted a days-long cat-and-mouse game as local employees tried to reopen stores and executives in Germany tried to stop them.
The Russian authorities also demanded that OBI officials testify about their plans. Prosecutors visited a store and inspected its computer system, the company told The Times.
OBI struck a deal that spring, ultimately selling for the symbolic price of a few dollars.
The buyer, a businessman named Josef Liokumovich, passed the company's background checks and was not on any financial blacklists. But as OBI soon learned, Western companies have no control over who ultimately takes over their operations.
In less than a year, OBI's Russia operation changed owners four times, ultimately landing with associates of the Russian senator Arsen B. Kanokov, who is under U.S. Treasury sanctions. At one point, an ally of the Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov appeared in the ownership register.
Such redirection is why diplomats and experts say it is too early to understand the changing landscape. The true new owners of some businesses might not be known for years, if ever.
"These guys," Urszula Nartowska, OBI's top lawyer, said, "they have the power of what they want to take. And you have to accept that."
In June, the Kremlin demonstrated what companies could expect: Moscow approved the Kinross gold mine sale, but with a stunning alteration. The sale price had been cut in half, to $ 340 million.
The buyer, Highland Gold, would later be blacklisted by British officials who said that gold provided a "significant income stream for Russia's war effort."
"The government realized they could dictate who buys, and maybe use that power to reward connected buyers," said Alan Kartashkin, a lawyer for Debevoise & Plimpton who spent decades in Moscow and has negotiated the exits of Western companies.
"I remember thinking," Mr. Kartashkin added, "once they feel they have the power to control entirely private transactions, where the government has no equity interest, they're not going to stop."
'This Business Is Already Russian'
The mood was celebratory in July when the Russian minister of industry and trade, Denis V. Manturov, appeared at a St. Petersburg elevator factory.
The plant had recently belonged to the world's largest elevator company, the Connecticut-based Otis Worldwide. Now it belonged to a firm controlled by Armen M. Sarkisyan, who had made a fortune running the Russian lottery in part thanks to government connections.
Mr. Manturov bragged that Moscow had brokered special arrangements for the sale. He gushed about a new production line and robust demand for elevators in Russian high-rises. "This business is already Russian," he said. It was now known as Meteor.
Mr. Sarkisyan is an example of a unique creation of the war: a businessman who was politically connected enough to win such a prize and rich enough to close the deal -- but not so closely linked to the Kremlin that he was subject to international sanctions.
Mr. Sarkisyan and others, almost overnight, absorbed huge corners of their markets.
When the Finnish elevator giant Kone tried to sell to its employees, the authorities rejected the deal. Once again, Mr. Sarkisyan's holding company, S8 Capital, became the buyer.
S8 Capital also moved into the tire business, snapping up the Russian operation of the German company Continental, before buying the top Russian tire maker, Cordiant, and entering talks to purchase the Russian factory of the Japanese tire maker Bridgestone.
S8 Capital did not respond to requests for comment.
By the summer of 2022, Russia's economy had stabilized, the ruble had rebounded and Mr. Putin's strategy shifted.
While early in the war, companies like McDonald's had sold to local managers or local business associates, with an option to return to Russia later, such deals soon became more difficult.
Having climbed out of crisis, the government wanted to do more than just keep the doors open. It increasingly wanted to dictate the terms of every deal.
In August of that year, Mr. Putin issued a decree requiring that companies in key industries obtain his signature before selling their Russian assets. Scores of businesses, including divisions of Siemens and Caterpillar, were suddenly subject to the whims of Mr. Putin himself.
"The government was beginning to tighten up the process, and it was becoming a lot more challenging," said Laura Brank, a lawyer at Dechert helping Western companies to exit. "I was telling clients we'd better get moving quickly."
The Subcommission
For most companies trying to leave Russia, the gatekeepers operate out of a gray government building near Red Square. Eleven days after the war began, Mr. Putin empaneled a special "subcommission" there to review requests to sell.
Mr. Putin's longtime finance minister, Anton G. Siluanov, leads the subcommission, which includes officials from the Kremlin, the central bank and key ministries.
They decide whether companies can leave and under what terms.
Once a company has struck a deal with a buyer, the negotiations often begin again -- this time in secret, between the buyer and one of the Russian government ministries. The seller is largely excluded. That process, lawyers say, often ends with a lower sale price and at times a new buyer. The deal then goes to the subcommission. Sometimes, deals fall through after months of silence.
Internal minutes, reviewed by The Times, show that the subcommission scrutinizes even the smallest details. In one meeting last year, the panel approved the $ 59,000 sale of a tiny apartment owned by the Finnish tire company Nokian.
The subcommission wields enormous power. Minutes show that it rejected a proposal by the American electronics company Honeywell to sell its factories until an assessment proved that the Russian buyer was getting a 50 percent discount.
Despite the bureaucracy, businesspeople have jockeyed behind the scenes for the most lucrative assets, often appealing directly to Mr. Putin.
Such was the case in the summer of 2022, when Mondi, a British-Austrian paper company, found a buyer for one of Russia's largest mills and sought government approval to sell.
As the deal came together, one of Mr. Putin's old K.G.B. buddies, Sergei V. Chemezov, appeared. He wrote a letter asking that the president steer the mill toward a group of investors, including the state-owned firm he runs. He even suggested a way to structure the deal to get around Western sanctions. The Times reviewed a copy of the letter.
Neither Mr. Chemezov nor the state-owned company responded to requests for comment.
Mr. Chemezov's deal never happened, but neither did Mondi's original agreement. The subcommission put the mill in the hands of a Moscow property developer for significantly less than the original price.
Abroad, Professor Sonnenfeld and others kept up the pressure. More than 200 companies had earned "F" grades on his list. Professor Sonnenfeld testified before Congress in November 2022. Remaining in Russia, he said, was tantamount to supporting the government.
But under Mr. Putin's rules, leaving also directly benefited the government and, in turn, the war.
This year, the parent company of Ikea sold its Russian malls to a state-controlled bank. Nokian sold its operation to an oil company owned by a Russian regional government. The Russian operations of Nissan, Renault and Toyota were taken over by a state company.
The Russian government has looked to use former Western auto factories to produce vehicles, yachts and private jets for the state-owned luxury brand Aurus, according to an internal Trade Ministry document obtained by The Times.
Neither the Trade nor Finance Ministries responded to requests for comment.
Mr. Putin also found a way to bring money straight into state coffers.
Early on, foreign deals were subjected to what the government called a "voluntary tax" -- required for the privilege of taking money out of Russia in a lump sum. Companies that opted not to pay the tax would receive their payouts in installments.
But by early this year, Mr. Putin had stopped giving them the choice. Companies had to pay the tax, and they still might get their money in installments.
The Kremlin also made explicit what had been implied since the Kinross deal: Companies were required to sell for at least a 50 percent markdown.
Heineken, for About a Dollar
By 2023, the landscape had become unknowable. The Kremlin constantly changed the rules and seemed to be always demanding more. Companies including Unilever announced that they would rather remain in Russia than have their assets end up in the government's hands.
Against that backdrop, executives at Heineken and Carlsberg were still negotiating with prospective buyers this year when Mr. Putin awarded himself even greater powers.
The Russian government, he decreed in April, could seize foreign assets and put them under the temporary oversight of whomever it liked. Companies now risked being seized outright.
Heineken reached a deal that month and the buyer, a Kazakh businessman, requested government approval. Carlsberg executives followed suit, planning to sell to Arnest, the Russian aerosol maker that had recently snapped up the highly profitable drinks-packaging business of the U.S.-based Ball Corporation.
Both brewers felt confident that, more than a year after announcing plans to leave Russia, they would finally do so.
In July, Mr. Putin blindsided Carlsberg executives by seizing the company and placing it in the hands of his longtime associate and judo friend, Taimuraz Bolloev.
Carlsberg was an attractive target. The company controlled the iconic Russian beer brand Baltika and had recently valued its Russian operation at about $ 3 billion. Its sales application had revealed that it was sitting on a half-billion dollars in cash.
In another twist, Russian officials also rejected Heineken's deal. According to the people close to the negotiations, the authorities steered the business toward Arnest -- a consolation, perhaps, for having lost the far more lucrative Carlsberg.
The deal went through for a single euro and the promise to repay $ 100 million in debt.
For Carlsberg executives, the saga was far from over. Mr. Bolloev, they said, has pressured them to sign over the company permanently.
"It would require that we literally did a deal with Putin and his administration, creating a legitimate transaction where they could take over our business for basically close to nothing," Jacob Aarup-Andersen, the Carlsberg chief executive, said in an interview last month. "We just couldn't do that."
Within weeks, the Russian authorities had arrested two company employees and raided their homes. This month, Russian news outlets reported, Mr. Bolloev asked the authorities to nationalize the company.
Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former president who is the deputy chairman of Russia's security council, expressed no sympathy for companies trying to move money out of the country and take it back to the very countries arming Ukraine.
He taunted Carlsberg, thanking them for padding the Russian budget.
"A strong budget means help for the front," he wrote last month. "In this regard, the senseless Danes also contribute to modern Russian weapons."

While early in the war, companies like McDonald's had sold to local managers or local business associates, with an option to return to Russia later, such deals soon became more difficult.
Having climbed out of crisis, the government wanted to do more than just keep the doors open. It increasingly wanted to dictate the terms of every deal.
In August of that year, Mr. Putin issued a decree requiring that companies in key industries obtain his signature before selling their Russian assets. Scores of businesses, including divisions of Siemens and Caterpillar, were suddenly subject to the whims of Mr. Putin himself.
"The government was beginning to tighten up the process, and it was becoming a lot more challenging," said Laura Brank, a lawyer at Dechert helping Western companies to exit. "I was telling clients we'd better get moving quickly."
For most companies trying to leave Russia, the gatekeepers operate out of a gray government building near Red Square. Eleven days after the war began, Mr. Putin empaneled a special "subcommission" there to review requests to sell.
Mr. Putin's longtime finance minister, Anton G. Siluanov, leads the subcommission, which includes officials from the Kremlin, the central bank and key ministries.
They decide whether companies can leave and under what terms.
Once a company has struck a deal with a buyer, the negotiations often begin again -- this time in secret, between the buyer and one of the Russian government ministries. The seller is largely excluded. That process, lawyers say, often ends with a lower sale price and at times a new buyer. The deal then goes to the subcommission. Sometimes, deals fall through after months of silence.
Internal minutes, reviewed by The Times, show that the subcommission scrutinizes even the smallest details. In one meeting last year, the panel approved the $ 59,000 sale of a tiny apartment owned by the Finnish tire company Nokian.
The subcommission wields enormous power. Minutes show that it rejected a proposal by the American electronics company Honeywell to sell its factories until an assessment proved that the Russian buyer was getting a 50 percent discount.
Despite the bureaucracy, businesspeople have jockeyed behind the scenes for the most lucrative assets, often appealing directly to Mr. Putin.
Such was the case in the summer of 2022, when Mondi, a British-Austrian paper company, found a buyer for one of Russia's largest mills and sought government approval to sell.
As the deal came together, one of Mr. Putin's old K.G.B. buddies, Sergei V. Chemezov, appeared. He wrote a letter asking that the president steer the mill toward a group of investors, including the state-owned firm he runs. He even suggested a way to structure the deal to get around Western sanctions. The Times reviewed a copy of the letter.
Neither Mr. Chemezov nor the state-owned company responded to requests for comment.
Mr. Chemezov's deal never happened, but neither did Mondi's original agreement. The subcommission put the mill in the hands of a Moscow property developer for significantly less than the original price.
Abroad, Professor Sonnenfeld and others kept up the pressure. More than 200 companies had earned "F" grades on his list. Professor Sonnenfeld testified before Congress in November 2022. Remaining in Russia, he said, was tantamount to supporting the government.
But under Mr. Putin's rules, leaving also directly benefited the government and, in turn, the war.
This year, the parent company of Ikea sold its Russian malls to a state-controlled bank. Nokian sold its operation to an oil company owned by a Russian regional government. The Russian operations of Nissan, Renault and Toyota were taken over by a state company.
The Russian government has looked to use former Western auto factories to produce vehicles, yachts and private jets for the state-owned luxury brand Aurus, according to an internal Trade Ministry document obtained by The Times.
Neither the Trade nor Finance Ministries responded to requests for comment.
Mr. Putin also found a way to bring money straight into state coffers.
Early on, foreign deals were subjected to what the government called a "voluntary tax" -- required for the privilege of taking money out of Russia in a lump sum. Companies that opted not to pay the tax would receive their payouts in installments.
But by early this year, Mr. Putin had stopped giving them the choice. Companies had to pay the tax, and they still might get their money in installments.
The Kremlin also made explicit what had been implied since the Kinross deal: Companies were required to sell for at least a 50 percent markdown.
By 2023, the landscape had become unknowable. The Kremlin constantly changed the rules and seemed to be always demanding more. Companies including Unilever announced that they would rather remain in Russia than have their assets end up in the government's hands.
Against that backdrop, executives at Heineken and Carlsberg were still negotiating with prospective buyers this year when Mr. Putin awarded himself even greater powers.
The Russian government, he decreed in April, could seize foreign assets and put them under the temporary oversight of whomever it liked. Companies now risked being seized outright.
Heineken reached a deal that month and the buyer, a Kazakh businessman, requested government approval. Carlsberg executives followed suit, planning to sell to Arnest, the Russian aerosol maker that had recently snapped up the highly profitable drinks-packaging business of the U.S.-based Ball Corporation.
Both brewers felt confident that, more than a year after announcing plans to leave Russia, they would finally do so.
In July, Mr. Putin blindsided Carlsberg executives by seizing the company and placing it in the hands of his longtime associate and judo friend, Taimuraz Bolloev.
Carlsberg was an attractive target. The company controlled the iconic Russian beer brand Baltika and had recently valued its Russian operation at about $ 3 billion. Its sales application had revealed that it was sitting on a half-billion dollars in cash.
In another twist, Russian officials also rejected Heineken's deal. According to the people close to the negotiations, the authorities steered the business toward Arnest -- a consolation, perhaps, for having lost the far more lucrative Carlsberg.
The deal went through for a single euro and the promise to repay $ 100 million in debt.
For Carlsberg executives, the saga was far from over. Mr. Bolloev, they said, has pressured them to sign over the company permanently.
"It would require that we literally did a deal with Putin and his administration, creating a legitimate transaction where they could take over our business for basically close to nothing," Jacob Aarup-Andersen, the Carlsberg chief executive, said in an interview last month. "We just couldn't do that."
Within weeks, the Russian authorities had arrested two company employees and raided their homes. This month, Russian news outlets reported, Mr. Bolloev asked the authorities to nationalize the company.
Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former president who is the deputy chairman of Russia's security council, expressed no sympathy for companies trying to move money out of the country and take it back to the very countries arming Ukraine.
He taunted Carlsberg, thanking them for padding the Russian budget.
"A strong budget means help for the front," he wrote last month. "In this regard, the senseless Danes also contribute to modern Russian weapons."

Tighter Tax Credits May Hurt Electric Vehicle Sales: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Purchases of popular models like the Tesla Model 3 and the Ford Mustang Mach-E may no longer entitle buyers to tax savings because the cars do not meet tougher sourcing requirements.
Efforts to fight global warming could suffer a setback next year when new rules reduce the number of electric cars that qualify for a federal tax credit.
The credits, up to $ 7,500 a vehicle, have helped make electric cars more affordable, bringing the cost of some models below $ 30,000. Next year, for the first time, dealers will be able to give buyers the credit when they purchase a car, rather than telling them to claim it on their tax returns.
But qualifying for the subsidy will become more difficult on Jan. 1 because of Biden administration rules intended to encourage automakers to manufacture vehicles and parts in North America, while bypassing China. Most automakers are still years away from breaking their dependence on China for batteries and essential materials like refined lithium.
The stricter rules, which stem from the Inflation Reduction Act, throw up another impediment to electric vehicles. Sales of such cars and trucks are already growing less briskly than a year ago because of high interest rates and drivers' anxiety about finding charging stations.
Electric vehicles are still the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry, and Americans have already bought more than one million this year. Sales will rise another 32 percent in 2024, according to BloombergNEF, compared to 47 percent in 2023. But Ford Motor, General Motors and Tesla have slowed investment as the pace of growth has cooled.
The list of fully electric vehicles that qualify for tax credits was already limited. Under rules that took effect this year, the credit was available only to cars manufactured in North America.
To collect the full credit, carmakers also must meet quotas on how much of their battery components and certain raw materials come from the United States or trade allies. Tesla, General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Rivian and Nissan are the only companies offering electric cars that qualify for the at least a partial credit. Some plug-in hybrid cars from Audi, BMW, Chrysler, Jeep and Lincoln also qualify for tax breaks.
New rules kicking in on Jan. 1 add another set of restrictions, disqualifying vehicles containing components made in China or made elsewhere by a firm under the control of the Chinese government.
"If it was already confusing for consumers, it gets even more confusing," said Kevin Roberts, director of industry insights and analytics at CarGurus, an online marketplace.
Tesla, which accounts for half of all the electric vehicles sold in the United States, has warned on its website that the least expensive Model 3 sedan and a long-range version will no longer qualify after Dec. 31. The cars have a battery made in China. The existing credits lowered the price of the base Model 3 to around $ 30,000, on a par with similarly equipped gasoline cars like the Toyota Camry or Honda Accord.
The stricter rules will also disqualify Ford's Mustang Mach-E, which has been eligible for half the credit and was the fourth-most-popular U.S. electric vehicle this year. Ford is still figuring out whether the F-150 Lighting, an electric pickup, will be eligible, a spokesman said.
The rules are complex and could still be modified by administration officials, leading to confusion among industry executives. In the worst case, only a handful of vehicles will qualify.
Volkswagen said it is "cautiously optimistic" that its ID.4 electric sport utility vehicle, made in Chattanooga, Tenn., will continue to get the credit.
General Motors said it is assessing whether its electric lineup, which includes the Chevrolet Bolt and an electric version of the Silverado pickup, will qualify. Nissan, whose electric Leaf is eligible for half of the $ 7,500 credit, did not respond to a request for comment. Rivian, whose electric pickups and S.U.V.s have qualified, also did not respond.
There is another way drivers can benefit from the credit. Under an exception intended for businesses with vehicle fleets, the Inflation Reduction Act allows dealers to apply the subsidy to leased vehicles and pass it on to customers. That wrinkle has helped Hyundai and other foreign automakers remain competitive even though they do not produce electric vehicles and batteries in the United States.
More than 40 percent of Hyundai's electric vehicle sales are leases, a spokesman said, up from just 5 percent before new restrictions took effect this year. The same provision in the law has allowed people who lease cars made abroad by Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volvo and Polestar to receive the credit indirectly.
But leasing is not a panacea. Many people prefer to own their cars, and foreign automakers are sore that they have been excluded from the subsidy available to buyers. The electric vehicle credit "is overly complex and unfortunately creating customer and dealer confusion," Volvo Cars said in a statement.
But the lawmakers who drafted and passed the Inflation Reduction Act have said they wrote it to force carmakers to realign their supply chains. That is happening, but the changes will take some time to bear fruit.
The list of eligible vehicles could grow over the course of 2024 as carmakers ramp up U.S. production to qualify for the credits and other subsidies.
The Korean automaker Kia expects to begin producing the EV9, a seven-passenger electric sport utility vehicle, at a factory in Georgia next year. Those domestically assembled vehicles should be eligible for half the credit, or $ 3,750, a Kia spokesman said.
Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, Dodge, Ram and Jeep, plans to introduce six mass-market electric vehicles in 2024, including versions of the Dodge Charger, Jeep Wagoneer and Ram pickup. The company has not said whether the vehicles will qualify for credits.
Some hybrids, which have internal combustion engines and electric motors, will also qualify if they meet the sourcing requirements and have a battery with a capacity of at least seven kilowatt-hours.
The Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid will most likely still be eligible for a $ 7,500 credit, a company spokesman said, while buyers of the Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe and Jeep Wrangler 4xe hybrids are expected to be eligible for up to $ 3,750.
Market forces are pushing down the prices of electric vehicles, a trend that is expected to continue as carmakers increase production. The average list price of an electric vehicle fell to $ 63,000 in November from $ 68,000 a year earlier, according to CarGurus. The average list price of a vehicle with an internal combustion engine was $ 48,000, the same as in the previous year.
Federal subsidies and loans for battery factories and electric car plants are also helping to lower prices. At some point during the next several years, analysts expect electric vehicles to become less expensive than internal combustion models even without tax credits.
"The long-term trend is going to be one of reducing prices," Mr. Roberts of CarGurus said. "You are going to see more mainstream vehicles."

Full text: How I was banned from Filene's department store.
The Northshore Mall, in Peabody, Mass., was the mall. Our mall. The competing mall, Liberty Tree, a mile or so down the road, suffered from inferior stores and worse parking. So in the 1990s and early 2000s, Northshore was where the kids from my area congregated, to wander through the department stores, and then on toward J. Crew, for roll-neck sweaters; Abercrombie & Fitch, for boyfriend jeans; and Pacific Sunwear, for anything related to skater culture.
I was 18, and my style was wholly attached to whatever glossy catalog arrived at my mother's pristine home in Newburyport. My friend was 19, wearing outdated bell-bottoms and driving a very old Nissan that rattled. Filene's, the week before Christmas, was heady with the spray of perfume.
I didn't think we were being watched. To me, we were invincible. I palmed a cool, hard MAC foundation compact in my hand.
"I just don't think this is a good idea," my friend whispered, though she was usually the one with bad ideas.
I was the one who had left home to go to a good college while she stayed behind. I was the one who had pursued perfectionism -- and just this once I wanted to do something a little strange, a little bad, a little raw.
My friend jabbed an elbow into my ribs and gestured toward a middle-aged woman with dry blond hair who stood at the end of the makeup counter. The woman was just minding her business, I said, shopping like everyone else.
So I slipped that compact -- a sample, I would later realize -- into the sleeve of my coat. It jumped up, a black pebble next to my skin, with such ease that I tried something else: a set of stacked bracelets, jewel-like but not jewels. I could have afforded all of this stuff, but there was no thrill in wielding a credit card at Filene's around Christmas. The bracelets were pretty. I dropped them into my J. Crew wool pocket. One. Two. Three.
My friend was now overcome with paranoia, and it wasn't until we turned to leave the department store that I realized she hadn't been merely spooked from too many years of smoking pot. The woman she thought was looking at us? That was a secret shopper, someone hired by Filene's to look for holiday-season shoplifters.
A moment later, we were in a dungeonlike room beneath the main floor. Although my friend had been an innocent bystander -- an abettor, if anything -- she was considered guilty, too.
The room had cinder-block walls painted a green-gray color. On a cork bulletin board, someone had posted a grainy photograph of a previous shoplifter. The offender's name was written in bold red letters. The message was clear: You can't leave your mistakes at the doorstep. At least, not at Filene's.
My friend and I sat at a metal desk, the stolen treasures before us. Even in the fluorescent green-yellow light, the bracelets shimmered. They would have looked pretty stacked on my arm at a holiday party, like tinsel, like the gold curling ribbon my mother used to wrap presents. Even then, the smooth black makeup compact beckoned to me. I wanted to pick it up, to hold it in my hand one last time.
A beefy managerial type entered the room and placed two palms on the metal table. He leaned into us, and we were stuck between him -- the corporealness of the man -- and our hard, cold chairs. "You were trying to steal a sample?" he asked. He pushed back his thinning hair, in disbelief that I had risked so much for so little.
I clenched my teeth and tried to smile. Was it better to admit that I didn't know it was a sample or to pretend that I had done it on purpose? Only an idiot would take something that a million people had already used. Only an idiot would steal something that was effectively free.
I'm not sure what the MAC compact had symbolized for me. Risk, maybe. Glamour. Something intangible that I could pluck from a counter.
Upstairs, taking it had felt easy and forgivable. But here in the basement, the consequences were obvious. I could make some of them disappear, but my friend would have a harder time of it.
"I told you," she said under her breath. "I told you, I told you, I told you."
The beefy man ran down the list of what was going to happen next. There would be a court date and a fine. But first we were going to have to stand by the wall and have our pictures taken. He also told us we were going to be banned from Filene's -- Filene's, our favorite department store, and the major entrance to the mall, where everyone we knew, including our parents, did their shopping! -- for life.
My friend crumpled at this disclosure. A court date was one thing. Even the fine, a financial burden that was almost insurmountable for her, was something she could accept. But the idea of never walking into Filene's again, the place where we had shopped for prom dresses and back-to-school clothes, this was a nail in the coffin.
We stood with our backs against those cinder blocks, first me, then her. The camera flashed, and maybe our eyes were open, or maybe they were shut against the light. They never let us see the photos.
Friendships survive all kinds of insults, grave and unserious, and ours survived this, but not forever. I had the kind of life that could permit the wading in and out of trouble. The idea that things were easier for me than they were for my friend would be a slow and simmering realization that began with the set of stacked bracelets and a used makeup compact taken from a Filene's counter.
We were escorted through a maze of basement rooms and then into the blast of cinnamon and nutmeg and peppermint and warm air and shoppers and good cheer on the floor above. From there we were led to the wide entrance, where, with a gesture that felt almost like a push, we were sent into the belly of the Northshore Mall, never to return, not as friends, and not as enemies, either.

U.A.W. Says 3 Carmakers Violated Labor Laws: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A week after declaring a drive to organize nonunion automakers, the United Automobile Workers union filed charges against three foreign manufacturers.
The United Automobile Workers union accused three foreign automakers on Monday of unfair labor practices, asserting that they had interfered with efforts by employees to build support for the union at U.S. plants.
The union said it had filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board contending that the automakers -- Honda, Hyundai and Volkswagen -- had tried to prevent workers from discussing U.A.W. representation at work and that the companies had discriminated against those who had done so.
The action came two weeks after the U.A.W. announced an effort to organize nonunion plants owned by 10 foreign-owned companies, along with the domestic manufacturers Tesla, Lucid and Rivian, which make electric vehicles. The union has tried unsuccessfully to unionize some of those companies' factories in recent years, but not simultaneously on such a wide scale.
The U.A.W. said Monday that hundreds of workers at Honda's plant in Greensburg, Ind., and at Hyundai's plant in Montgomery, Ala., and more than 1,000 workers at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., had signed cards expressing support for joining the union.
At Honda, the union said, workers "report being targeted and surveilled by management for pro-union activity," while at Hyundai, "management has unlawfully confiscated, destroyed, and prohibited pro-union materials in nonwork areas during nonwork times."
It said that Volkswagen "had harassed and threatened workers for talking about the union" and that it had "confiscated and destroyed pro-union materials in the break room," among other accusations.
In a statement, Volkswagen said that it took such accusations seriously and that it would investigate the matter. "Volkswagen respects our workers' right to determine who should represent their interests in the workplace," it said.
Honda said, "We have not and would not interfere with our associates' right to engage in activity supporting or opposing the U.A.W." Hyundai said that the union's depiction of the matter was not accurate and that its workers "may choose to join a union or not as is their legal right."
Shawn Fain, the U.A.W. president, lashed out at the three companies in a statement issued by the union. "These companies are breaking the law in an attempt to get autoworkers to sit down and shut up instead of fighting for their fair share," he said. "But these workers are showing management that they won't be intimidated out of their right to speak up and organize for a better life."
The U.A.W. is trying to organize foreign-owned plants after a six-week wave of strikes against the three Detroit automakers -- Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, which makes Jeep, Chrysler and other brands -- that resulted in contracts providing record wage increases and additional gains in benefits.
In addition to Honda, Hyundai and Volkswagen, the foreign companies that the U.A.W. said last week that it was targeting are Toyota, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru, Mazda and Volvo.
The new contracts at Ford, G.M. and Stellantis raise the top hourly wage to $ 40 at the end of the four-and-a-half-year term, from $ 32 previously. Hourly wages at the foreign automakers in the United States generally range from the high teens to the high 20s.
After the U.A.W. agreements with the Detroit automakers were reached this fall, Honda said it would provide raises of 11 percent next year, and Hyundai said it would increase pay 14 percent next year and 25 percent by 2028. Toyota also announced raises.

U.A.W. Aims To Unionize More Plants: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The United Automobile Workers' effort, with a long-elusive goal, follows its success in securing big raises in contracts with the Detroit automakers.
The United Automobile Workers union announced Wednesday that it was undertaking an ambitious drive to organize plants owned by more than a dozen nonunion automakers, including Tesla and several foreign companies -- a goal that has long eluded it.
The move comes weeks after the U.A.W. won new contracts from General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis that included wage increases of 25 percent or more over four and a half years for its 146,000 members employed there.
In addition to Tesla, the targets of the drive are two other electric vehicle start-ups, Lucid and Rivian, and 10 foreign-owned automakers: Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru, Volkswagen, Mazda and Volvo.
The U.S. plants owned by those companies employ nearly 150,000 workers in 13 states, the union said.
If the organizing drive gains momentum, it could become one of the largest by the U.A.W. since its infancy in the 1930s. The union's past efforts to organize even single plants owned by the foreign automakers, concentrated in the South, came to nought. A foothold among those companies would signal a big shift in the American auto industry, where nonunion manufacturers have long had a significant cost advantage over the Detroit automakers.
The union said the organizing drive had been prompted by inquiries from several thousand workers at nonunion plants.
"Workers across the country, from the West to the Midwest and especially in the South, are reaching out to join our movement and to join the U.A.W.," the union's president, Shawn Fain, said in a video posted on Facebook. "The money is there. The time is right."
A Honda statement cited the automaker's "competitive wages and benefits," adding, "We do not believe an outside party would enhance the excellent employment experience of our associates." Hyundai referred to its "excellent wages and benefits," adding, "Our team members have not shown an interest in union representation." Subaru pointed to wage increases and its benefits package but did not comment directly on the union drive. Rivian and Volkswagen said they had no comment.
At the DealBook Summit conference sponsored by The New York Times on Wednesday, Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, said, "If Tesla gets unionized, it will be because we deserve it and we failed in some way." He reiterated his opposition to unions, saying that "it's not good to have an adversarial relationship" between groups within a company.
The other companies did not respond to requests for comment.
On Wednesday, the U.A.W. activated websites where workers can electronically sign cards that serve as an official certification of their desire to have union representation. Earlier, at a handful of plants, the U.A.W. had already received signed cards from more than 30 percent of the work force, the threshold required under federal law for the union to move forward with a vote on unionization, a person familiar with the matter said.
The union is now working to send organizers to areas around these nonunion plants to collaborate with workers at those factories, this person said.
After the U.A.W. reached agreements with the Detroit automakers to raise wages, Toyota, Honda and Hyundai announced that they, too, would increase workers' pay.
Toyota has told workers that it will raise hourly rates 9 percent in January. Honda will lift wages 11 percent and Hyundai 14 percent next year. Hyundai plans to increase wages 25 percent by 2028.
The U.A.W. said Wednesday that it was making a concerted effort to organize a large Toyota plant in Georgetown, Ky., that employs about 7,800 workers and produces the Camry sedan and RAV4 sport utility vehicle.
U.A.W. members have long earned more than nonunion workers. At plants in the South, wages tend to start below $ 20 an hour and top out at less than $ 30. The top U.A.W. hourly wage, previously $ 32, climbed to more than $ 40 in the contracts the union signed with the three Detroit manufacturers.
The U.A.W. has fallen short twice in the past decade -- by narrow margins, in 2014 and 2019 -- in unionization votes at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tenn. The U.A.W. lost by a substantial margin at a Nissan plant in Canton, Miss., in 2017. Organizing efforts at other companies' plants have petered out before coming to a vote.
But after Mr. Fain became the union's president this year, the union promised a more aggressive approach to its contract talks with the Big Three and vowed to renew efforts to widen its reach in the industry.
In addition to wage gains at the Detroit companies, the U.A.W. won agreements to preserve jobs and to keep open a Stellantis plant in Illinois that had been slated to close.
Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said the U.A.W.'s wage gains created a stronger case for joining the union.
"It shows collective bargaining works and shows the U.A.W. was successful," he said. "They can say: 'We saved this plant. Look at what we got. You can have this, too."'
Past organizing drives were hurt because the U.A.W. had a tarnished image, Mr. Wheaton added: Many unionized plants had closed, its members had been required to accept wage and benefit cuts to help the Detroit manufacturers survive the 2009 financial crisis, and federal corruption investigations had implicated senior union officials.
"A lot of the negative things about the union -- a lot of that stuff has gone away now," Mr. Wheaton said.

The United Auto Workers union announced Wednesday that it was undertaking an ambitious drive to organize plants owned by more than a dozen nonunion automakers, including Tesla and several foreign companies — a goal that has long eluded it.
The move comes weeks after the UAW won new contracts from General Motors, Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis that included wage increases of 25% or more over 4 1/2 years for its 146,000 members employed there.
In addition to Tesla, the targets of the drive are two other electric vehicle startups, Lucid and Rivian, and 10 foreign-owned automakers: Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru, Volkswagen, Mazda and Volvo.

Nissan to Build 3 Electric Cars At Britain Plant: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company said it would build three electric models at its plant in northeast England, bolstering the future of Britain's auto industry.
Nissan said Friday that it would invest an additional 1.1 billion pounds (about $ 1.4 billion) to make three new electric models at its plant in Sunderland in northeast England.
The announcement, which included plans for an additional battery plant, appears to go a long way to ensure that a substantial auto manufacturing industry will continue in Britain in the coming decade or longer.
Until recently that wasn't assured. Brexit, which has made trade with the European Union more cumbersome, and the global shift to electric cars had raised fears that the British vehicle manufacturing industry faced an existential crisis. Britain's output of cars has fallen by around 50 percent over the last six years.
"I think it is a very significant investment," said Peter Wells, an automotive specialist at Cardiff Business School.
Besides the plan to make three electric models in Sunderland, Nissan said it would make its auto plant the anchor of a low-emissions industrial complex. The facilities would include a new plant to make electric car batteries as well as solar and wind farms to generate green electricity for the plants and a power system to link the facilities. The hope would be to attract additional suppliers, creating many more jobs.
The battery plant would join two others: one currently in operation, and another under development, both run by Envision AESC, a subsidiary of a Chinese company that partners with Nissan. Envision AESC is expected to build the third plant.
Mr. Wells said this idea of creating a green manufacturing hub in northeast England was the key to the announcement. As automakers' shift to lower emission vehicles, they will also want to cut the carbon footprint in their manufacturing, he said.
"This is the future of this kind of operation," Mr. Wells said. "The long game is to have zero-carbon manufacturing."
Nissan's Sunderland plant churned out 238,000 vehicles in 2022, more than any other assembly plant in Britain, although it previously produced half a million vehicles annually. The company announced it would make electric versions of two conventional models now produced there, the popular Qashqai and the Juke. Sunderland will also make the next generation of the Leaf, an electric model that has been made at the plant for a decade.
If successful, the plan could help protect the jobs of the 7,000 employees Nissan has in Britain. "Our U.K. team will be designing, engineering and manufacturing the vehicles of the future," Makoto Uchida, Nissan's president and chief executive, told workers at the Sunderland plant Friday, according to a company statement.
In recent months, auto manufacturers with substantial interests in Britain agreed to shore up the British industry. Tata, the Indian conglomerate that owns Jaguar Land Rover, previously announced an up to £4 billion investment in a large battery plant. And in September BMW said it would invest £600 million to build electric versions of its popular Mini car models in Britain.
At the same time, the British government of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has been pushed to provide aid to secure manufacturing jobs in industries like auto making and steel. On Wednesday, the government announced an additional £2 billion to support zero emissions car manufacturing as part of an overall statement on spending.
A spokesman for Nissan declined to disclose the amount of aid it would receive from the government, saying that discussions were still ongoing.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: I GREW UP in India with all the major world religions. I attended a Christian boarding school in a Hindu-majority country that is roughly tied with Pakistan for the second-largest Muslim population in the world. My mother's family were Sikhs, and I counted among my closest friends a Jew from Bombay and Buddhists from Tibet. Pilgrimage is common to all of these faiths, even as it is utterly distinctive. In Islam, the pilgrimage to Mecca is an ordained pillar of faith that the Prophet Muhammad performed himself. In Christianity, the culture of cherishing relics and visiting holy places is said to have begun with Saint Helena -- the mother of Constantine I, the first Roman emperor to convert to Christianity in 312 -- rushing off to the Holy Land in search of the True Cross. Some pilgrimages enshrine sorrow, like the Ashura in Iraq, which would be the last stop on my journey; others, like fiesta in Bolivia's Copacabana, are pilgrimages of joy and rapture. Some are historical, like the Jewish commemoration of exile; others, like the Mecca pilgrimage, represent the repurposing of an older sanctity, in this case that of pre-Islamic Arabia. Some pilgrimages focus on a single day, others a season, a month, an auspicious alignment of the stars. In India, which has some of the greatest scenes of pilgrimage anywhere in the world, such as the Kumbh Mela, where every 12 years the largest gathering of humanity on earth -- more than 100 million -- comes together at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers, I had also witnessed the touching intimacy of a family or group of friends who set out for a holy place on a Sunday, just as someone might go fishing or to a national park in the United States.
It was the ordinariness of this latter kind of pilgrimage, away from the grand spectacles of Ashura and fiesta, that I had hoped to capture in Buddhist Mongolia. I had imagined springtime pilgrimages, people visiting monasteries as the weather warmed. If La Paz is the highest capital in the world, Ulaanbaatar is the coldest, with January temperatures reaching minus 30 degrees. In fact, even as I was setting out at the end of May, my guide and translator, Orgilbaatar Tsolmon, who goes by Orgil, was sending me videos of snow showers in the Mongolian capital.
My flight from New York connected through Istanbul; the first leg was 10 hours, and from there we flew another eight hours in a level line across the face of Asia. The Black Sea gave way to the Caspian and, beyond, to a land of mountain, desert and steppe. The Mongols, led by Genghis Khan and his descendants, poured over the steppe in the 13th century and, in the words of the 18th-century British historian Edward Gibbon, "the caliphs fell, and the Caesars trembled on their throne," even as representatives of the major faiths -- from Islam and Nestorian Christianity to Taoism and myriad forms of Buddhism -- would come before the great khans to make their case for why their particular creed ought to be the official religion of the empire.
My first glimpse of Mongolia was of rolling hills draped in thin emerald grass, of cloud shadows the size of lakes and of raking beams of morning light breaking through a heavy sky. "Nomadism," I scribbled in my notebook in a sleepless haze, "captures the very spiritual heart of pilgrimage, which is to wander." If the Latin peregrinus gives us "pilgrim," it also gives us "peregrination."
Orgil was waiting for me at Chinggis Khaan International Airport in Ulaanbaatar with a red Nissan SUV. My first thought on seeing him, with his long hair and light beard, was of the Nepalese artist Araniko's late 13th-century rendering of Kublai Khan, Genghis Khan's grandson. "In Xanadu, did Kubla Khan / A stately pleasure-dome decree. ..." The Coleridge poem was the first I had committed to memory as a child, during a blackout in Delhi, but Kublai was more than the figment of an opium dream. He was a full historical personage who founded the Yuan dynasty (1279-1368) in China and established Beijing (then known as Dadu) as its capital, and was the man whose conversion to Buddhism around 1258 brought shamanic Mongolia into the orbit of Tibetan Buddhism.
The influence of Buddhism grew sporadically for almost seven centuries in Mongolia, merging in profound ways with its ancient worship of nature -- of mountains, water, the eternal blue sky. But then, in the early decades of the 20th century, Buddhism encountered a mortal enemy: Soviet-backed Communism. Even by the standards of a tumultuous century, the Stalin-directed purges of the late 1930s stood out for their systematic eradication of Mongolia's religious culture. The great majority of the country's monastic institutions were leveled to the ground; some 18,000 monks were killed; and, in a society where about one-third of the adult male population were lamas (though not all living in monasteries), Buddhism was ripped out root and branch.
In 1990, with the fall of Communism, religious freedom was established in Mongolia and Buddhism was allowed to be practiced again. My first destination was the Khamar monastery, 300 miles south in the Gobi Desert, which had been all but destroyed in 1938. It was said to be situated at one of the portals to Shambhala -- a mythical kingdom of peace and tranquillity in the Buddhist imagining -- and had been founded in the century before by an artist, saint and sybarite called Danzanravjaa, known as the lama of the Gobi. Bolivia had given me new respect for the survival of the sacred, despite great political and historical upheavals, and I was curious to see what pilgrimage would look like in a place where it had been stamped out for generations -- curious to see the old pilgrim routes leading back to the locus of sanctity, like neural pathways reforming around an area of trauma.
MONGOLIA, BROADLY SPEAKING, is a country with half the landmass of India and a population smaller than that of Los Angeles proper -- some 3.3 million people -- of which about half live in Ulaanbaatar alone. As we left the capital's new Japanese-built airport armed with supplies of chips, Snickers, Coke Zeros and vodka as offerings, I gained a first impression of an unnerving emptiness. After some initial settlements of white yurts, or gers, as they're known here, and houses with brightly colored corrugated roofs behind dark wooden stockades, all signs of habitation fell away. On that morning in late May, spectral wisps of snow blew over the long two-lane highway, and the wind was so strong that I found it difficult to put my jacket on outside the car.
Amid what seemed like trackless wastes there periodically appeared the giant ragged form of an ovoo, or cairn. Its beanpole of a body was bandaged in blue khadags (prayer scarves), its stony mound of a base littered with vodka bottles and the occasional skull of a dead animal. The ovoo is a monument to the spirits of the natural world, known here as nagas and savdags. Orgil, following the custom of honoring these easily offended beings, lest they punish you for your neglect, honked three times as we went by. "This is the Gen Z way," he said, grinning, "but I prefer the old way," which involves circling the ovoo on foot three times in a clockwise motion.
But it was too cold to stop. It was too cold to smoke, too cold to take a pee. The temperature was only in the low 30s, but the wind bit through me, and it was hard to believe that this was a relatively mild spring day by Mongolian standards. Outside Choir, a dust-bitten town halfway to the monastery, we inhaled a lunch of mutton broth and dumplings, fried rice and a meat-stuffed pastry called a khuushuur. Then we drove on, another four hours. The land turned arid and flat. Double-humped Bactrian camels appeared along the side of the road. An enticing band of opalescent sky offered the relief of a horizon after hours of rain and snow.
Orgil, in between telling me of his days in a metal band, when "I drank beers left and right," would occasionally grow serious. "During Communism," he said, "we lost our national identity." The purges of the 1930s plundered the country's monasteries and temples -- there had been some 700 in the 19th century -- which Orgil described as repositories of folklore, history, traditional medicine and learning. Mongolia, after winning independence from Qing China in 1911, began those early decades of the 20th century as a feudal theocracy with a godlike figure, akin to the Dalai Lama, called the Bogd Khan at its helm, overseeing around 80,000 monks. (The Dalai Lama recently introduced a Mongolian child as the 10th reincarnation of the Bogd.) "They shot all the head lamas," Orgil said. "They murdered all the teachers." The fires from the monasteries were rumored to have burned for weeks. Christopher Kaplonski, a social anthropologist who has conducted research in Mongolia, has written that, though the total number of Mongolians killed between 1937 and 1939 is unknown, "credible estimates range from 35,000 to 45,000."
As evening fell, we arrived at the ger camp on the edge of the Gobi, a short drive from the Khamar monastery. We were the only ones there. Orgil had made me worried that there would be no pilgrims at all. Bolivia was a lesson in the imperishability of the sacred, but it had also shown me how places of pilgrimage, like the sacred crag on the Island of the Sun, could die. If you ban a religion for more than half a century, murder its clergy and raze its monasteries, as the Communists had in Mongolia, then maybe you do deal it a death blow?
I was full of dark thoughts when the ger camp began magically to fill. I'd just finished a dinner of banshtai tsai, dumplings in a goat milk and tea broth, and retired to my ger, where I was watching the wood-burning stove cast shadows on the wooden lattice and felt walls, when I heard electronic music blaring into the Gobi. I stepped outside to see the neat rows of gers now brightly lit, noise and chatter pouring out of their doorways. Bottles of soda were being ferried back and forth and mixed with vodka. Prim, lightly made-up girls sat on the edges of what looked like the Mongolian equivalent of a frat party. "Who are these people?" I asked Orgil in amazement. "Pilgrims," he answered. Some were part of a construction company, others students with exams on the horizon. They had come to draw energy from Shambhala. The rites the next morning were to begin before dawn, yet the pilgrim parties, with their Chaucerian feeling of intimacy among strangers, continued raucously into the night.
Just before daybreak, at 4:20 a.m., we joined a cavalcade of SUVs off-roading through the desert, drawing ruby red parabolas over the dunes. Our first stop was a fertility shrine near the monastery. On a hill were two mounds of sand and rock with stone finials, connected by a beam that was wrapped in the blue prayer cloths. Women in puffer jackets with cartons of milk went back and forth between the shrine and the edge of the hill, casting their offerings of milk into the air. Orgil told me that no man could perform the rite unless his mother had died in the past 49 days, in which case he could perform it on behalf of her spirit.
The sun rose over the Gobi, showing reddish earth and black-edged dunes. The sky was a cold, motionless blue. While the women performed the ritual, I spoke to a group of men in their late 30s and early 40s who worked for a real estate company in Ulaanbaatar. One was an economist, another a lawyer, a third a businessman. They had arrived by train from the capital. "I came here to recharge my energy and cleanse my spirit," said Egi, the economist. (Mongolians use patronymics rather than Western-style surnames; in conversation, people often go by just one name.) "This place is a world energy center." When I asked if the ritual had been handed down to him by his parents, he said, "They knew about it, but they were not authorized to come. We are the lucky generation." He added: "This Shambhala reminds us that we are not just ordinary nomads. We had an enlightened one [Danzanravjaa] live among us." Since the transition to the democratic era, Egi said, "Mongolian people have come to know that we have a great religious and cultural heritage."
Munkhdul, the businessman, said in halting English, "It's a reconnection in modern times to the past of our life." Some moments later, our band of pilgrims (about 50 to 100) reconvened outside the gateway to the Shambhala complex, where a pair of mesmeric half-closed eyes, painted on a wall of pinkish orange, gazed out at us, symbolizing the inward-turned sagacity of the Buddha. Stepping across the threshold, we found ourselves in a rectangular enclosure of red earth marked out by a perimeter of white stupas. It was like being in a Zen garden, where one proceeded from one station to another, performing a series of rituals and rites under an open sky. In the distance, the level sands of the Gobi fell away as far as the eye could see. It was an austere, heart-stopping glimpse of the void.
Our guide, Haidav, was from the Gobi region. In his early 30s now, he had been selected as a boy by Gandantegchinlen (often referred to simply as Gandan), the country's main monastery in Ulaanbaatar, to spend four years in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, where, at a center of Tibetan Buddhism -- the Namdroling monastery, popularly known as the Golden Temple -- he had been educated in the religion of his forefathers with the express aim of reintroducing it to Mongolia. As he led us into the Shambhala, he seemed less like a guide than like a monk re-educating his countrymen about a faith whose core precepts, such as the belief in karma and reincarnation, had survived the ravages of Communism, but whose rituals had to be relearned from scratch. Our group was composed almost entirely of Mongolians, but no one knew what to do at the various stations any more than I did.
At the genie's belly, a low mound of dark rocks, Haidav told us to exhale all of our sins and bad thoughts, intentional and unintentional. At the site of Danzanravjaa's ger, which was just a circle in the sand, we offered handfuls of grain. We wished that "with the help of the enlightened one, we would be reborn into the Shambhala." Then we went to three other circles representing past, present and future. Haidav told us to walk not through but around them. We had open bottles of vodka in our hands and made offerings into the air. (Milk and vodka! It was a combination I would encounter time and again in this nomadic post-Soviet society.) Haidav told us not to wish for money or material things but only that which was regenerative -- a child, rain or power. He placed a special emphasis on looking in, on harmony and balance. He said that all the bad things that happen to us, whether ill health or failure in our careers, were emanations of what was within and, in cleansing the inner sphere, we could succeed in the outer.
If pilgrimage is exteriorized mysticism, a way for human beings to grasp spiritual truths, the Shambhala felt almost like a cosmogram or mandala, a metaphysical scheme writ small. We came to a circle of red rocks that was the energy heart of the whole enclosure. Here, we sat down. Some lay on the rocks and rolled from side to side. The aim was to draw in the energy of the place. I talked to Samdanbazar, a 78-year-old herder from Töv Province, in the environs of Ulaanbaatar. She wore a gold-and-purple deel, a long coat of sorts, fur lined in the winter, with tiny earrings, her dyed hair whitening at the roots. Watching her roll back and forth, taking such obvious pleasure in the rite, I couldn't help but ask what it had been like to be denied all of this for the first 45 years of her life. "We had to hide everything," she said. "My father was a lama, so we had to hide our thangkas [Tibetan Buddhist cloth paintings], Buddhas and religious artifacts."
Our last station was the Golden Skull Hill, where a central ovoo overlooked the desert beyond. There we chanted, "Um sain amgalan boltugai" -- "may there be peace with you" -- and sang "Ulemjiin Chanar" ("Perfect Qualities"), a Mongolian folk song that Danzanravjaa had composed himself. Haidav was almost scolding in the care with which he instructed us to sing as a chorus. "Whatever your failures," he said at the end of our morning at the Shambhala, "it's because of your mind."
THE EMPHASIS ON interiority, on isolating the self as the site for spiritual advancement and failure, felt very different from the Christian pilgrimage in Bolivia. The focus there had been outward: on Mary, her miracles, on what she could give you. Here, almost everyone spoke of enlightenment from within and of certain corrosive human emotions, anger being among the gravest of them, that would impede that progress. In Mongolia, the texture of sin felt less like a crime against God than against oneself. Three symbols are often associated with Danzanravjaa's life and thought: a female figure representing his love of pleasure; a swan symbolizing the arts; and, lastly, a scorpion signifying the human potential for self-destructiveness. Outside our ger camp, there was a giant metal sculpture of a black scorpion, its tail raised, surrounded by desert sands on all sides. It stood as a reminder of the cardinal sin in the Buddhist scheme: rage, which, like the myth of the scorpion, makes us our own worst enemies, liable to sting ourselves in the head.
Kublai Khan may have laid the foundation for the rise of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia, but it was a man called Zanabazar -- a monk, scholar and artist -- who solidified its position. In everything from scripture to ritual, temple design and even religious fashion, including monastic robes with blue cuffs evoking the blue sky that Genghis Khan claimed to worship, the hand of Zanabazar is visible.
At the Erdene Zuu monastery, founded by Zanabazar's great-grandfather in the 16th century after the declaration of Tibetan Buddhism as the state religion of Mongolia, I witnessed an amazing scene, proof of the cocktail of motives that puts us on the road to pilgrimage. Erdene Zuu, with its green-tiled roofs in the Chinese style, is Mongolia's oldest monastery, built in 1586. It is also located near the ruins of the Mongol capital at Karakorum, about 530 miles from Khamar monastery. On entering Erdene Zuu's vast, grassy complex, with its perimeter wall crenelated with white stupas and nothing but big sky on all sides, I felt the spirit of a Mongolian camp. Nomadism harbors a disdain for materiality, yet it was hard not to feel myself on consecrated ground, even if only in historical terms. It was mainly from here that the descendants of Genghis Khan in the 13th century brought the world to its knees, from present-day Ukraine to Korea. The site had more recent memories, too. Of its 62 temples and some 500 facilities, the vast majority had been destroyed during the ravages of the 1930s. All around me, amid a handful of stupas and temples, were the flattened foundations of buildings in the religious complex. There had been 1,500 lamas here in the 19th century; there were fewer than 50 today. At the entrance, I spoke briefly to Mandakhtsog Monkhbaatar, who was in his early 20s, dressed in orange-and-red robes with those huge turquoise cuffs and high boots with blue piping. Like Haidav, he had spent years studying at the Golden Temple monastery in India, relearning the traditions that Communism had left Mongolian Buddhism too depleted to teach. Monkhbaatar's great-grandfather had been a prominent lama in the southwestern province of Bayankhongor. When I asked the young monk about him, he said casually, "He was murdered," then rushed into the great complex, where the morning chants were set to begin.
A plump child lama in a plumed yellow cap appeared on the wooden watchtower of a temple whose sloping white facade evoked the Potala in Lhasa, Tibet -- the winter palace of the Dalai Lamas. A conch shell sounded three times. Knots of pilgrims and tourists milling about outside drew near. Inside, monks sat chanting on wooden benches in a blue-ceilinged room hung with thangkas. Sutras wrapped in yellow silk rotated on a turnstile. As bells and chanting reached a crescendo, amid clouds of incense, a woman in a black-and-copper deel, her schoolteacher's face tremulous with ardor, came rushing in. She then began to perform full-bodied prostrations in the aisle between the monks, some chanting, others laughing or charging their phones. Again and again, as the tempo rose around her, this thin, bespectacled woman prostrated herself in ecstasy, doing what is known in Sanskrit as ashtanga pranam, or the eight-body-part salute: hands, feet, knees, chest and chin. Watching her, I was reminded of a pilgrim I had once seen at a shrine in central India. He had looked like a bureaucrat or bank clerk, the ordinariness of his appearance only amplifying the extraordinariness of his actions. I'd watched him take a rock and place it on the floor a few feet away and then lie flat on the ground face down and wriggle his way toward it. He'd repeated the same gesture several times until he circled the shrine. "This," the young Brahmin whom I'd been traveling with said to me, "is bhava" (a kind of rapture). Later, I learned that the woman at Erdene Zuu was a 40-year-old herder from Inner Mongolia, the region of the country that had remained part of China after present-day (Outer) Mongolia won its independence in 1911. She told me that she'd been a devout Buddhist since she was a child. "It's the most perfect religion because it enlightens from within," she said. But it wasn't just Buddha who had brought her to Erdene Zuu. She said she came for Genghis Khan, too. "He was our ancestor," she said of the founder of the Mongol Empire -- who was not Buddhist but shamanic. "I wanted to receive the particular energy of this man here, in what was the capital of the Mongol Empire and of Buddhism."
"So is this a religious pilgrimage for you, or a nationalistic one?" I asked.
"It is both," she said. "For Mongolians, this is a sacred place. This is ancestral land." When I asked her if she felt Chinese at all, she said, "I'm 100 percent Mongol, even if I live in the part that's China. We may live in different locations, but that doesn't change the fact that we're all Mongols."
When I asked for her contact details, she demurred, explaining that to share them was unsafe. Then, as I was walking away, she came rushing after me, imploring me not to post the pictures we had taken together on any social media or mention her by name in whatever I wrote. It was a reminder that political peril had always been part of the calculus of pilgrimage, whether in the Middle Ages, when Islam's conquest of the Holy Land gave rise to local shrines, such as Santiago de Compostela and Canterbury, or now, for this pilgrimage-within-a-pilgrimage of a Mongolian herder, honoring her ethnic and spiritual ancestor, irrespective of any national boundary.
Growing up in India, I witnessed the intersection of religion and nationalism canalized into a militarized form of pilgrimage. In 1990, the Hindu nationalist leader L.K. Advani led a rath yatra, or "chariot pilgrimage," from Somnath temple in the western state of Gujarat, where a major Hindu temple saw the first of many assaults upon it in the 11th century. The yatra, steeped in historical pain and revenge, was headed for the city of Ayodhya, a thousand miles away in Uttar Pradesh, where a 16th-century mosque -- named after the Emperor Babur, who, incidentally, was a descendant of Genghis Khan and the founder of the Mughal (derived from Mongol) dynasty -- stood on the alleged site of what was the birthplace of the Hindu god Ram. The yatra was stopped before it got to Ayodhya, and Advani arrested, but the rage he had tapped into was not so easily contained. Two years later, on Dec. 6, 1992, a mob of kar sevaks, or religious volunteers, some coming as pilgrims with bricks for the construction of a new temple, destroyed the mosque. Religious riots ensued, and hundreds died. Ayodhya was the crucible that led to the ascendancy of Hindu nationalism in India. Two decades on, it gave rise to the majoritarian politics of Narendra Modi. Pilgrimage offered a release from the monotony of daily life, but it also galvanized people in the service of faith, often at the expense of other faiths, and over such a wholesale recruitment of people sent away from home full of religious zeal there forever hung the specter of a crusade.
ORGIL AND I drove some 1,500 miles in five days, off-roading over what felt like the spine of Asia: valleys of spring flowers with ancient burial sites encircled by gently creased hills of green velvet. Orgil let me drive. The full expanse of the steppe, streaked with islands of shadow, opened up around us. Sometimes the sky would darken and a storm would roll in, turning the furrowed hills a morose green; then a herd of semi-wild, rain-drenched horses might assemble at the center of the road. I had never seen such emptiness. I felt myself in a country where animals outnumbered people many times over. It was as exhilarating as it was disquieting -- the solitary sight of a ger in the distance, the cattle-covered crest of a hill dotted black, beige and white, as if the fickle hand of nature had taken up pointillism. It was easy to imagine this changeless landscape as one where people were especially attuned to the spirits of the natural world. "Throughout Mongolia it is believed," Orgil said, "that if you pollute the water, the savdag will be angry at you, so we don't even pour milk into the water, which we consider to be the purest thing." That shamanic worship had fertilized Mongolian Buddhism, giving it its distinct character, which in turn, because of the influence of Tibetan Buddhism, already included certain esoteric teachings, practices and rituals, known in classical India as the Tantras.
I hardly saw Ulaanbaatar until the end of my time in Mongolia. The location of the capital once known to Mongols as Khuree, meaning "monastery," and later to the Russians as Urga, had not been fixed until the late 1700s and, even today, the city of nearly 1.7 million has the air of a giant encampment. A suburban sprawl of ger neighborhoods -- ramshackle houses and yurts -- surround a Soviet-style city center of decaying apartment blocks and bureaucratic behemoths touched up with blue glass and steel.
Here, the Gandan monastery, the de facto Vatican of Mongolian Buddhism, was the only such institution allowed to remain partially open during Communism. Although it was closed during the purges of the late 1930s, Munkhbaatar Batchuluun, 45, a jovial lama who handled communications for the monastery, explained that it owed its survival to a cynical act of tokenism. Henry Wallace, Franklin D. Roosevelt's vice president at the time, was in Mongolia on a fact-finding mission in 1944, and the Communist government wanted to show that some modicum of religious freedom existed in Mongolia. Thus the Gandan, though hollowed out, was permitted to stay open as a Potemkin monastery. Mongolia had come as close as any society to having eradicated a religious way of life, with deep roots in the social fabric, yet here, too, as so often on this pilgrimage of mine, the sacred had triumphed in the end. The newly built main hall of the Gandan was swarming once more with pilgrims and lamas. The recitation of the sacred Ganjuur sutra -- a practice that had been repressed in Mongolia for decades, the renewal of which I was there to witness -- was underway. Sitting in the coffee shop downstairs, in a building that was a teeming complex of ATMs, broadcast studios and what Munkhbaatar referred to as "donation receiving desks," akin to cashiers at a bank, for the performance of various religious services, he described Buddhism as never really lost "but preserved in the minds of people."
As a boy in the countryside in the 1980s, he recalled his grandfather -- a lama who disrobed after the execution of his teacher -- performing Buddhist rites under cover of darkness at an altar he kept hidden in his home behind a curtain. The other villagers, who praised Communist ideals of progress by day, would by night call on his grandfather, the disrobed lama, to perform healing rites. The Buddha outlined three freedoms, Munkhbaatar explained, of behavior, speech and mind: "The Communists controlled the first two, but they could not control our minds," he said.
On my penultimate night in Ulaanbaatar, I went to meet a woman named Gerelmaa, who went by Giimaa for short, for a shamanic ceremony. She lived in a ger neighborhood in a small house, with a yard full of rubble and rotting armchairs. A white Hyundai sat on cinder blocks, framed against the setting sun. Giimaa, a stout chain smoker in her 60s with a single upper tooth, had been an East German-trained electrical engineer under Communism before becoming a shaman in 1991. She'd often travel up to 5,000 miles a year on pilgrimages to Uvs Province in the west of the country to draw energy from the place where one of her ancestors, a powerful shaman in his day, had once lived. As we sat in an upstairs room full of taxidermy birds of prey, she told me that she mostly uses her shamanic powers to help people cure illnesses and dispel dark energy.
Giimaa donned her heavy reindeer-skin coat, hung with a bear's foot, a vulture's claw, a wolf's paw and brightly colored tassels. She made offerings of milk and vodka, which her spirit, like those of most people in Mongolia, seemed to relish. With a veil over her face and feathers on her head, she began to beat a pentagonal drum, dancing about the small room.
Once the spirit took hold, Giimaa slumped down on the floor and began to speak in the gravelly voice of her male ancestor. She had told me not to be scared, but it was scary. The spirit asked about my life, and I gave him the salient details: I was the love child of a Pakistani politician and an Indian journalist. My father had been assassinated by his own bodyguard. I was married to a man from Tennessee and had been unable to return to India to see my family since 2019, when Modi's government had stripped me of my overseas citizenship only months after I wrote an article critical of his re-election.
The spirit saw darkness in my life. He asked me to envision my home in the United States and, touching me, flew there to dispel that dark energy. My mind zoomed up, too, giving me an aerial view of this scene of a shamanic ceremony in a little house with the sun setting over the hills surrounding Ulaanbaatar. I thought of my fellow pilgrims: Eduardo Quintela, and his quiet tribute to his father; Aracely Alcón, full of gratitude for Santiago's restored mobility; and the woman at Erdene Zuu on her perilous journey.
Pilgrimage in that moment seemed less to me like exteriorized mysticism and more a rite of remembrance. The world would have us forget what is painful. It would have us move on and be free of the past; but both as individuals and societies, we have our loyalties to what we have known and endured. Pilgrimage gave us the illusion of a forward movement across space, even as it allowed an inner journey toward communion with our past. It was a crystallization of the poet Joseph Brodsky's idea that "if there is any substitute for love, it's memory."

Full text: When Facebook bought WhatsApp for $ 19 billion nearly a decade ago, Mark Zuckerberg made a promise: The Facebook chief said he wouldn't meddle often with the messaging app so as not to mess with a good thing.
Mr. Zuckerberg stuck to that philosophy as WhatsApp amassed more than two billion users globally -- until 2019, when he began tapping the app's growth and business potential.
Now WhatsApp has become increasingly crucial to Meta, the company that owns Facebook, Instagram and other apps. More than half of Americans ages 18 to 35 who own a cellphone have installed WhatsApp, according to the company's studies, making it one of Meta's fastest-growing services in its most mature market. Ads on Facebook and Instagram that push users to WhatsApp and its sister messaging service, Messenger, are also growing so rapidly that they may reach $ 10 billion in revenue this year, the company recently said.
"If you're envisioning what will be the private social platform of the future, starting from scratch, I think it would basically look like WhatsApp," Mr. Zuckerberg, 39, said in a recent interview.
WhatsApp's momentum is a reminder that Meta remains at heart a business powered by its family of social apps. Although Mr. Zuckerberg has spent billions of dollars in recent years on his future-facing vision of the immersive digital world of the metaverse and on artificial intelligence, apps like WhatsApp are bringing in new users and revenue. That makes it one of the keys to his company's future, enabling Meta to explore costly, experimental and unproven products.
WhatsApp has also become a backbone of Meta's business in what Mr. Zuckerberg has declared to be "a year of efficiency." After global economic uncertainty last year caused an advertising slump, Meta cut nearly a third of its staff. It remains reliant on its core apps to deliver steady sales growth and to appeal to Wall Street.
In the interview, Mr. Zuckerberg positioned WhatsApp as a "next chapter" for his company. The messaging app could become a cornerstone for business messaging, he said, as well as a primary conversation app.
"Now that everyone has mobile phones and are basically producing content and messaging all day long, I think you can do something that's a lot better and more intimate than just a feed of all your friends," he said.
A decade ago, WhatsApp was a very different app -- by design. Jan Koum and Brian Acton, two engineers who had worked together at Yahoo, built WhatsApp as a fast, free and secure way to exchange messages with friends and family.
Importantly, WhatsApp used a data connection instead of mobile carriers' SMS messages, which often cost money. The service also didn't store people's messages on its servers. And it didn't have some bells and whistles that other apps, like iMessage, do, which allowed it to run quickly and easily on even slow data connections.
WhatsApp quickly took off, with hundreds of millions of people around the world downloading it in just a few years. That caught the attention of Mr. Zuckerberg, who snapped up WhatsApp in 2014 after it received overtures from Google and the Chinese internet company Tencent, two people familiar with the matter said.
Mr. Zuckerberg initially left most decisions about WhatsApp to its founders, who had stayed on after Facebook bought the app. Mr. Koum and Mr. Acton bristled at talk of making money and advertising, and put a priority on safety and security on the messaging service. In April 2016, WhatsApp rolled out end-to-end encryption, which keeps messages from being intercepted or viewed by parties outside the conversation.
"It felt like Facebook was keeping WhatsApp in its back pocket for a long time, as a kind of 'green field' opportunity for monetization," said Eric Seufert, an independent mobile analyst who follows Meta. "It has almost been more valuable for them as this unknown quantity, where they often said, 'Who knows how big the business could be?"'
But by 2019, Mr. Zuckerberg was champing at the bit to assert more control over his company's apps, tying them together so they would share data and technology. That led to the departures of WhatsApp's founders and other employees. Mr. Acton joined a rival company, Signal; Mr. Koum now focuses on philanthropy and buying high-end, air-cooled Porsches. Some former WhatsApp executives later accused Mr. Zuckerberg of breaking promises he had made concerning privacy when he bought the company.
Mr. Zuckerberg has since built WhatsApp into a more fully fleshed-out messaging service and business. WhatsApp has added more features, ranging from simple emoji reactions and message forwarding to disappearing messages and supporting the app across other devices, like Macs and Windows desktop computers.
For most of its life, WhatsApp had been more popular with users outside the United States. But with the new features, more Americans began trying the app. In the United States, it has grown fastest with young people in Miami, New York, Los Angeles and Seattle, according to the company's studies. A Snapchat-like feature that allows users to post temporary text, photo and video updates, called Status, has become the world's most used Stories product, Meta said.
WhatsApp also began offering paid tools and custom apps for businesses that wanted to use the platform to communicate with consumers. Chevrolet, Lenovo, Samsung and L'Oreal now use some of those tools, and WhatsApp has forged business and advertising partnerships in Latin America and India with companies such as Amazon and Uber.
In 2017, WhatsApp introduced "click-to-message" advertising, which is an ad format that businesses can buy to place inside a Facebook feed. When users click on the ad on Facebook, it links them to a brand's WhatsApp account, where they can talk with customer service representatives or take an action like booking a flight or buying goods. The ads have become Meta's fastest-growing ad format, the company said.
Nissan spent the past year building chatbots on WhatsApp that can help the automaker talk with its customers in Brazil and route them to a local car dealership. Between 30 to 40 percent of Nissan's new sales leads in Brazil now come through WhatsApp, the auto company said, and the service has reduced its response time to customers to a matter of seconds from an average of 30 minutes.
"You're not being intrusive because you're willing to help customers at their own pace," Mauricio Greco, marketing director for Nissan Brazil, said in an interview. "This is about giving our salespeople the tools they need, because they actually want to sell."
Nikila Srinivasan, a Meta vice president of product management, said the company was also building its payments infrastructure and working with companies in India, Brazil and Singapore to allow people to pay for purchases directly inside WhatsApp. More than 200 million businesses use WhatsApp's professional business apps, she said.
Still, WhatsApp is contending with competitors and regulatory hurdles. Its biggest rival is iMessage, Apple's native messaging app, which comes installed on every iPhone and Mac. It is also grappling with smaller but well-loved upstarts like Signal and Telegram, which is especially popular in Europe.
In Europe, WhatsApp may be forced to integrate with competing messaging services as part of the requirements under a new law, the Digital Markets Act, Mr. Seufert said. The company has said it has begun the difficult technical work of making sure that WhatsApp users can send messages to rival apps in the region.
Some regulators have also pushed against encryption, a key feature of WhatsApp and iMessage, saying it makes it more difficult for the authorities to monitor or catch criminals.
Will Cathcart, the head of WhatsApp, has defended WhatsApp's privacy controls and said he would fight "tooth and nail" against any country that wanted to weaken its encryption.
One sign of how WhatsApp is evolving is Channels, a feature that was unveiled in September. Channels lets people follow status updates from influencers like Bad Bunny, the musician who dropped a reference to WhatsApp in his track "Moscow Mule" last year, without divulging their phone number or contact information. WhatsApp now has more than 225 channels, including one for The New York Times, that each have more than a million followers.
The goal is to make WhatsApp a household name, whether it is to shop, chat or stay on top of news and events, Mr. Cathcart said.
"The conversation has moved from 'WhatsApp is the app I use outside the U.S. when I travel,"' he said. "It's becoming significantly more mainstream."

SAN FRANCISCO — When Facebook bought WhatsApp for $19 billion nearly a decade ago, Mark Zuckerberg made a promise: The Facebook chief said he wouldn’t meddle often with the messaging app so as not to mess with a good thing.

U.A.W. Deal Won't Put Ford At a Disadvantage, Analysts Say: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A tentative agreement gives union members at the carmaker their best terms in decades but could complicate Ford's electric vehicle plans.
When autoworkers went on strike in September, executives of the large U.S. automakers warned that union demands could significantly undermine their ability to compete in a fast-changing industry. The chief executive of Ford Motor said that the company might have to scrap its investment in electric vehicles.
The future doesn't look quite that bleak now that Ford and the United Automobile Workers union have reached a tentative agreement that is likely to serve as a template for deals the union eventually reaches with General Motors and Stellantis, the maker of Ram, Jeep and Chrysler.
Ford's costs will rise under the terms of the new contract, which includes a 25 percent raise over four and a half years, improved retirement benefits and other provisions. The extra expense will weigh on profit and could hamper Ford's ability to invest in new technology, John Lawler, the company's chief financial officer, said Thursday.
But some analysts said the increases should be manageable. What will matter more for the company's prospects, they said, is how innovative and efficient the company is in designing and producing cars and technology that can compete with offerings from Tesla, which dominates electric vehicles, the auto industry's fastest growing segment.
"They haven't agreed to anything that will kill their competitiveness," said Joshua Murray, an associate professor at Vanderbilt University who is an author of a book that examined how U.S. automakers lost ground to Japanese and European rivals. He said the deal could even help Ford, in part because the four-year contract ensures there would be no labor strife during an intense phase of the transition to electric vehicles.
"They won't be engaged in labor conflict while they're dealing with" the technology shift, Mr. Murray said.
Ford said on Thursday that it earned $ 1.2 billion from July through September on revenue of $ 44 billion; the company lost $ 827 million in the third quarter of 2022. But the division that makes electric vehicles lost $ 1.3 billion because of investments in new technology and increasing competition that has pushed down prices.
The roughly 17,000 Ford workers who had been on strike, out of a total of 57,000 U.A.W. employees at the company, are expected to begin returning to factories soon. At U.A.W. Local 900 in Wayne, Mich., across the street from a Ford plant that was one of the first three factories to be struck by the U.A.W., workers were disposing of signs, firewood and bottled water that had been stockpiled for picket lines.
"This is the best contract I have seen in my 30 years with Ford," said Robert Carter, 49, who works with engineers to lay out work stations on the assembly line. He said younger workers who had been earning well below the top wage of $ 32 an hour would see the biggest impact with the new contract; their pay would rise to more than $ 40 an hour over the next four and a half years.
"For some people, their pay is going to almost double," he said. "How can you say that's not huge?"
The reaction on Wall Street suggested that investors did not regard the agreement as a catastrophe. The carmaker's shares fell 1.7 percent during regular trading on Thursday.
But Ford stock slumped almost 5 percent in after-hours trading after the company said that, because of the cost of the strike, it could no longer stand by an earlier estimate that profit before interest expenses and taxes would be $ 11 billion to $ 12 billion in 2023. Mr. Lawler also said that strike would cost the company $ 1.3 billion this year.
Analysts at Barclays estimated the annual cost of pay raises, improved retirement benefits and other measures in the new union contract to be $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion annually by the end of the four-year contract period, or equivalent to about 1 percent of sales.
Mr. Lawler said on a conference call that the contract would raise the company's labor costs by an average of $ 850 to $ 900 per vehicle. He said Ford would try to "identify efficiencies and improve productivity to help us deliver on our targets" in light of those higher labor costs.
Some analysts were critical of the deal with the U.A.W., saying the cost to Ford could put it at a significant disadvantage, perhaps prompting the company to move more production to Mexico.
"It adds a constraint in a very competitive market," said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive. "It's definitely a compromise that, I think, down the road will either limit Ford's performance or force them to consider alternatives."
During the contentious negotiations, Ford complained that a big raise for workers would put it even further behind Tesla in the electric vehicle market. Sales of Ford's two main battery-powered models, the F-150 Lightning truck and the Mustang Mach-E sport-utility vehicle, have been disappointing this year, and the company recently scaled back plans to increase production of the Lightning.
"There is tremendous downward pressure on E.V. pricing," Mr. Lawler said.
But Tesla and other automakers like Toyota, Hyundai, Nissan and Honda, whose factories in the United States do not have unions, may now face pressure to raise wages, eroding any cost advantage they might have had.
The U.A.W. has declared its intention to try to organize those factories. The pay agreement with Ford, by far the biggest boost in compensation that the union has won in decades, is likely to serve as a powerful advertisement for collective bargaining.
"Elon Musk better be looking at this," said Madeline Janis, executive director of Jobs to Move America, an advocacy group that has close ties to organized labor. "Hyundai and Toyota better be looking at this. This is a new era where workers are standing up."
Tesla, the company Mr. Musk runs, and other carmakers that don't have union workers in the United States, like BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, may decide to pre-emptively hand out raises to keep labor organizers at bay.
"One strategy to deter union organizing is to raise wages," said Rebecca Kolins Givan, an associate professor of labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers University.
The decisive factor in the electric vehicle market will be the ability of Ford, G.M. and Stellantis to produce innovative products, Ms. Givan and others said. That is the responsibility of management, not assembly line workers.
"It's clear that these companies have work to do in the electric vehicle market," Ms. Givan said. "There is nothing in this contract that creates any constraints."
In addition to the 25 percent pay increase, the contract gives Ford's hourly workers cost-of-living wage adjustments, major gains on pensions and job security, and the right to strike over plant closings. The union had initially asked for a 40 percent wage increase.
Ford has not yet set dates for restarting plants idled by the strike. The company previously said it could take up to four weeks to reach full production. Ford also needs some 600 suppliers to resume production and to deliver parts.
"Bringing a plant back up is much more difficult than taking it down," Bryce Currie, vice president of Americas manufacturing at Ford, said this month.
Workers at the Wayne plant, which makes the Ranger pickup and the Bronco sport-utility vehicle, had not received return-to-work orders on Thursday, but they expected to be back on the assembly line next week.
Walter Robinson, 57, has worked at the Wayne plant for 34 years and expects to retire by the end of the new contract. But he said three of his children work for Ford and would see a big benefit from the new terms.
"My daughter has only been here two years, and it was going to take years for her to get the top wage," he said. "This is going to help her immensely. This is going to make all of their lives better."

Full text: The three U.S. automakers say they are already at a disadvantage to nonunion rivals while labor leaders hope that big gains in negotiations will inspire workers in Southern states to unionize.
Tens of thousands of people who work for Toyota in Kentucky, Mercedes-Benz in Alabama or Tesla in Texas are technically not involved in the high-stakes negotiations taking place between labor and management in and around Detroit.
But they are very much a presence.
Executives at Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent of Chrysler, invoke nonunion automakers, many of them in the South, as a competitive threat that makes it impossible for them to meet striking workers' demands for big raises, more generous benefits and better working conditions.
"Toyota, Honda, Tesla and others are loving this strike because they know the longer it goes on, the better it is for them," Bill Ford, the executive chair of Ford Motor, said in Michigan last week. "They will win, and all of us will lose."
The United Automobile Workers union sees such statements as an attempt to play workers off one another. It views the strikes, entering their sixth week, as a first step toward better pay for not only U.A.W. members but also the nonunion workers that it plans to recruit in the future.
"We won't be used in this phony competition," Shawn Fain, the U.A.W. president, said on Friday, reacting to Mr. Ford's speech. He added, "Nonunion autoworkers are not the enemy. Those are our future union family."
The pay gap between union and nonunion factories has long been a point of contention. Some industry executives have argued that high union wages were a big reason G.M. and Chrysler had to resort to bankruptcy after the 2008 financial crisis.
Union leaders and progressive lawmakers have asserted that the growth of nonunion manufacturing, mostly in the South but also in the Midwest and West, has helped to erode the middle class over the past several decades.
Veteran union autoworkers tend to make more than production workers who are not represented by unions. They often have more say in their schedules and overtime work.
But starting pay at Ford, G.M. and Stellantis factories can be lower than at nonunion factories. And the pay of nonunion workers at Southern auto plants tends to go further because the cost of living there is lower than it is in the Midwest.
Even the geographic divide between union and nonunion plant is not always as clear as it may seem. Toyota and Honda have plants in the South, where unions are weak, but they also have factories in Ohio and Indiana, where unions are stronger. And G.M. and Ford have union operations in Kentucky, Tennessee and Texas.
The debate about auto industry wages has become more urgent as automakers invest billions to build factories that produce batteries for electric cars. Most of those factories are being built in Southern states, like Georgia and Tennessee, where local laws make it more difficult for unions to organize a factory.
"A good agreement with the Detroit Three would be powerful because it gives union organizers better arguments for joining the union," said Ian Greer, a Cornell research professor who studies the effect of electric vehicles on labor.
Even with a union wage of almost $ 32 an hour from her job assembling chassis at a Ford factory in Chicago, Schataan Lyke said she did not have it easy. She is the sole breadwinner for three children and worries about how to afford a prom dress for her oldest.
Ms. Lyke, who has been on strike, said she was glad to have the union behind her. "You've got someone on the outside fighting for you," she said.
But Ms. Lyke, 37, has it better than people doing similar work in the South. At a Nissan factory in Canton, Miss., Morris Mock, 49, makes about $ 1 less than Ms. Lyke per hour even with more than 20 years of experience, he said.
An attempt to unionize Nissan in 2017 failed to win enough support from workers. That means Mr. Mock, one of the people who led the union drive, will not benefit directly from the contract that the U.A.W. works out with automakers. But he said he was glad the union was fighting to protect wages as the industry switched to electric vehicles.
"The market is about to change," Mr. Mock said. "I'm glad that they understand that we must put workers first."
Government statistics suggest wide regional pay gaps. Michigan autoworkers make 22 percent more than production workers in Tennessee, 23 percent more than South Carolina workers and 28 percent more than Alabama workers, according to a Census Bureau survey. Those figures include people who work for suppliers, where pay is often lower than in factories that assemble vehicles.
Some labor experts said the bigger difference between union and nonunion autoworkers had less to do with pay and more with things like mandatory overtime and the scheduling of shifts. Union workers tend to have more say in those matters.
The auto industry has been moving South for decades, drawn by lower costs, weak unions and local government incentives. Foreign automakers have often chosen sites in the South when they set up factories in the United States. BMW and Volvo Cars have factories in South Carolina; Mercedes and Hyundai in Alabama; Toyota in Kentucky; and Volkswagen in Tennessee.
Most of the foreign automakers do not disclose what they pay their workers. Volkswagen, an exception, said the starting pay at its factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., was $ 21.10 for hourly production workers. Veteran workers earn more than $ 29, the company said.
Foreign automakers concentrated in the South sometimes pay their U.S. workers more than Ford, G.M. and Stellantis, according to a study by EY for Autos Drive America, an industry association that represents Nissan, Toyota, Mercedes and others.
The average starting wage at foreign automakers was $ 19 an hour, the survey said, more than the $ 17 starting wage for U.A.W. members. But the average maximum pay at the foreign automakers was $ 28, compared with $ 32 for U.A.W. members under the current contract.
A Nissan spokesman declined to say how much the company pays its U.S. workers, but he said the average was higher than that reported by the Autos Drive America survey.
Tesla, which is based in Texas and has factories there and in Buffalo; Fremont, Calif.; and Sparks, Nev., does not disclose what it pays its workers, but the Detroit automakers say it is less than what they pay.
Ford has said its labor costs, including benefits and bonuses, are 40 percent more per worker than Tesla's. That figure does not include stock awards that at least some Tesla employees receive. On Tesla's website, job advertisements for a production associate pay $ 20 to $ 23 an hour.
Even if autoworker pay in Alabama or Mississippi is less than what it is in Michigan or Illinois, it is often more than what employers in other industries pay in those places.
Working conditions are often a bigger issue than pay, labor representatives say.
In February, Emily Erickson of the University of Warwick in England and Berneece Herbert of Jackson State University published a survey of 211 workers at Mercedes's factory in Vance, Ala., near Tuscaloosa.
The workers reported earning an average of $ 27 an hour at Mercedes, high for the region. But they said they were forced to work overtime or change their work schedules with little notice. Almost half worked more than 50 hours a week. The study also found that white workers made an average of $ 3 more per hour than Black workers.
Mercedes denied that it discriminates. "Our pay structure is equal for all team members regardless of race, age or ethnic origin, and our pay progressions are based on seniority," the company said in a statement.
It noted that the company employed 6,000 people in Alabama, suggesting that the study sampled too few workers. "We do not agree with its conclusions," Mercedes said.
The gulf between pay in the South and the North is certain to widen when Ford, G.M. and Stellantis agree on new contracts with the U.A.W. The union is demanding a 40 percent increase over four years. Ford, G.M. and Stellantis have already offered raises of 23 percent and could go higher.
Unions have made some progress in the South recently. Workers at Blue Bird, which makes school buses in Georgia, voted to join the United Steelworkers in May and are negotiating a contract. Workers at ZF, which makes axles for Mercedes in Alabama, ended a monthlong strike last week after the German company agreed to raise the top hourly wage to $ 23.
Labor leaders say they have already been deluged with calls from workers at Toyota, Volkswagen and Hyundai who expressed interest in organizing unions. Workers at Volkswagen voted not to join the union in 2019, but the environment may be different this time.
"These workers will say, 'Look what the U.A.W. did for these workers at G.M., Ford and Stellantis,"' said Tim Smith, director of U.A.W. Region 8, which includes all of the Southeast.
"We've got organizers on the ground there right now," he said. "We're starting to make our move."

Caught in the Middle, They Live in Their Cars: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Chrystal Audet tried to get comfortable in what she called her "bedroom" -- the back seat of her eight-year-old Ford Fusion. To stretch her legs, she had to leave a passenger door ajar, but September nights are raw in the Pacific Northwest, with sheets of rain that cut to the bone.
From her own "bedroom" in the front seat, her 26-year-old daughter Cierra Audet asked her to close it.
"We have to get out of this," Ms. Audet said to herself as she pulled a comforter against the cold and struggled to fall asleep in a parking lot in Kirkland, Wash.
Ms. Audet, 49, earns over $ 72,000 a year as a social worker for the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services. But a combination of bad luck, bad debt and a bad credit score priced her out of her apartment in Bellevue, another suburb of Seattle, one of the most expensive housing markets in the country. With an eviction looming, she put her furniture in storage this spring and began parking the sedan in a U-shaped parking lot outside a church in Kirkland.
The car, her biggest investment, became her home -- the roof turned into a dining table, the trunk a closet. And a weathered stretch of blacktop provided by a Methodist church became her yard, her neighborhood and her safe place.
Around the country, real estate is being set aside for people like Ms. Audet in the form of parking lots. Dozens of such lots have opened in the last five years, with new ones being announced every few months, including as far east as Pennsylvania and North Carolina. They are sprinkled across the Midwest in Green Bay, Wis., and Duluth, Minn. And they dot the spine of the Pacific Northwest, providing a safe harbor for a growing cohort of working Americans who are wedged in the unforgiving middle. They earn too little to afford rent but too much to receive government assistance and have turned their cars into a form of affordable housing.
The idea of providing a parking lot for homeless parkers is nearly two decades old, with the first known lot opening in the shadow of Santa Barbara's mansions in 2004. But the idea didn't take off nationally for some time.
The Lake Washington United Methodist Church began experimenting with offering a beachhead for the "mobile homeless" in 2011 in response to Seattle's "scofflaw ordinance," which called for the impounding of cars that had accrued multiple parking tickets, a law that was disastrous for people forced to live in their cars. "Our simple idea was, 'Hey, if they're in our parking lot, they won't get parking tickets. And they won't get booted and towed,"' said Karina O'Malley, who helped create the program.
Now it is one of 12 in Washington State.
"Tens of thousands of people are living in their vehicles," said Graham J. Pruss, an applied anthropologist studying the trend, who heads the National Vehicle Residency Collective. "It's huge."
'One Bill Too Many'
In 2001, Ms. Audet posted a bad check. It went to court and ended up on her record, one of several setbacks that have damaged her credit.
Her free fall into unsustainable debt began last December when her car made a horrible, sputtering sound, and died. With poor credit, the only loan she could find came at a punishing cost: For the 2015 Ford Fusion with over 100,000 miles, she is being charged interest of 27.99 percent, equaling a payment of $ 398 per month, one-tenth of her take-home pay.
Medical bills in the thousands arrived for her Crohn's disease. She missed two rent payments. And then the landlord raised her rent $ 248 a month.
"It was a case of one bill too many," Ms. Audet said.
Down the spiral that led her to homelessness were a series of forks -- choices between bad and very bad that she made, many in moments of desperation. She spent a week at a hotel. Expedia offered to break up her payments, which she is now paying off at the rate of $ 138 a month. To avoid her unpaid rent going to collections, she signed an installment plan, agreeing to pay $ 495 per month.
By midsummer, Ms. Audet's take-home pay of nearly $ 4,300 a month was hollowed out by bills totaling nearly $ 2,600, leaving her with too little to pay for an apartment in a market where the median rent is $ 2,200.
She finally found the parking lot after seeing a news story about parking programs for homeless people. A tiny house is typically 300 square feet. For months, Ms. Audet, her daughter and their cream-colored mutt Coda lived out of a space that was no more than 30 square feet.
The fact that she was able to hang on to her car allowed her to maintain a semblance of normalcy. Almost no one knew her secret. Each morning, Ms. Audet used a portable toilet to get ready for work, then commuted to the downtown Seattle office of the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, where she spent her day sitting behind a plexiglass partition across from some of the city's most destitute residents.
"There's no judgment here," she told the desperate people seeking government assistance, including a man clutching a medical certificate proving that he is blind. She helped him qualify for disability benefits. "It could be me on the other side of this glass," she told them.
She, in fact, was on the other side of the glass -- her bank account overdrawn by more than $ 900, a black hole of loans and bills that ate up her paycheck the moment it landed. Because she spent her days assisting others, she knew that she earned too much to be helped herself: The cutoff for receiving housing assistance in King County is 80 percent of the median income, or $ 70,650, said Benjamin Maritz, a member of the King County Regional Homelessness Authority Implementation Board.
In many cities, the "mobile homeless" are now the majority of the homeless population -- people living out of vehicles make up about 53 percent in King County, Washington, where Ms. Audet lives. About 45 percent in San Mateo, a county perched on California's rugged northern cliffs, are in the same predicament. In Los Angeles, the number approaches 60 percent.
Many of them have jobs: In Denver, 135 out of the 217 people who slept in one of the lots provided by the Colorado Safe Parking Initiative earlier this year earned an average of $ 1,581 a month. One-bedrooms there average $ 1,655.
After losing his job in January as a purchasing agent for a gardening company in Denver, Josh, 37, who asked that he be identified by his first name only because he had not told his family about his predicament, moved into his Toyota RAV 4. Finding somewhere safe to park was a daily struggle: "I was bouncing around between gyms, hotel parking lots, light industrial areas and the side streets off of hotels or apartments," he said. Soon after, he learned he had colon cancer.
One night, when he was sleeping outside a Planet Fitness, he woke up to a man trying to break in. He left after Josh pushed the emergency button on his key fob. On another night when it was snowing, he parked in the lot of a Super 8 motel and found tracks leading to his car and the snow sheared from one of the car's handles the next morning.
He called the Colorado Safe Parking Initiative, one of the newest in the country which operates thirteen lots in Denver, and begged the operator for a spot.
Josh now lives in one of the lots and commutes to his chemotherapy appointments.
There are so many people in need of a place to park that most are turned away. "We can only serve 10 to 20 percent of the people who call us," said the executive director, Terrell Curtis.
In other parking lots across the country, car dwellers shared the hardships that landed them there: A man who scraped by delivering pizzas in Santa Barbara ended up in his Nissan Frontier when the pizza parlor cut his hours. A 35-year-old who installed home security systems ended up in his Chevy Suburban when he lost control of the drill, snapping his radial tendon. And one woman said she had to choose between helping her mother or herself.
"The rent just kept going up and up and up," said Brooke Rosales, 41, describing how she and her mother shared an apartment in Lakewood, Colo., scraping by through a delicate lean-to of wages and disability benefits. Ms. Rosales suffers from grand mal seizures while her mother has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
It came crashing down when the mother's condition progressed and she was no longer able to work. Sandy Rosales, 64, now struggles to breathe. Unable to make rent, the mother moved in with her son.
There was no room for Brooke Rosales, who ended up in her Jeep Liberty at a lot for homeless parkers in Denver.
Shame
To try to stay ahead of the tsunami of bills, Ms. Audet worked two jobs. On a recent evening, after clocking out at the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, Ms. Audet took Bus No. 554 back to Kirkland, where her daughter, a college student, waited for her. They spent the next three hours delivering food through DoorDash, breaking for dinner and picking up the next day. The pair earned $ 86.05 that evening, then spent $ 20 on gas and $ 20.37 at a waffle place for a takeout dinner.
They ate in the empty parking lot of a middle school, the Styrofoam container laid out on the roof of the Ford.
"It's the irony of working and making a nice income and still not being able to afford housing," Ms. Audet said. "I make $ 32 and some change per hour, but even still, I find myself struggling."
To bathe, Ms. Audet and her daughter headed to a state park the next morning. It's inside a 489-acre forest of Douglas firs crisscrossed by trails. They found that the parking lot was roped off -- an equestrian competition was underway. So they parked on the highway, across from the park entrance, next to a "Tow Away Area" sign. She and her daughter took turns walking across the highway with their toiletries; one person needed to stay with the car to make sure it wasn't towed.
Ms. Audet padded across the two-lane road in the pajamas she had slept in the night before. She had bought a bucket at the drugstore in order to carry her lotions, but on this particular morning she decided to leave it in the trunk, carrying her creams, her razor and her rosewater body wash in her arms, covered by a towel.
"I didn't want to draw attention to myself," she whispered, as she passed teenage girls leading shiny horses with braided manes.
On the door of the public shower, someone had taped a real estate listing to the wall, advertising a $ 4.25 million home. It was walking distance away and featured a three-stall barn, custom millwork and heated floors. Six miles from the public restroom where Ms. Audet showers is the exclusive community where Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos live.
Calculated Omission
There are so many ways in which a person's life becomes smaller when they are forced to fit a home into a car. To avoid using the portable toilet at night, Ms. Audet tried to limit how much water she drank, leading to dehydration. The fact that she couldn't properly stretch out caused her ankles to swell to the point that she couldn't fit into her tennis shoes. Mother and daughter draped sheets over the car's windows to try to have a measure of privacy at night. When it rained, the sheets got wet and with nowhere to dry them out, they became moldy.
In between working two jobs and navigating the church parking lot and the public shower, Ms. Audet found time to search for apartments. She was presented with the impossible math of her life: Her pay stubs presented one picture -- that of a woman earning a respectable income -- but as soon as the apartment managers pulled her credit report, their expressions changed, she said. With a score of 562, considered "Very Poor" by credit reporting agencies, she was asked to find a co-signer, or else provide multiple months of deposits. She didn't have so much as the first month's rent.
Her luck changed in late August at an event inside the church, when housing activists noticed that she was being trailed by a Times reporter. Several offered their business cards. One coached her on how to approach potential landlords -- what to share and what to omit.
Soon after, she toured a $ 2,360-a-month one-bedroom in Redmond, Wash. At 673 square feet, it was a palace: Bright, white countertops and shiny floors stretched over floor space 20 times the size of her car.
A calculated omission -- one that she wasn't proud of but felt necessary as winter approached -- allowed her to clear the first hurdle. On the form requesting two years of rental history, she left off her most recent apartment. Because she had entered into a payment agreement, the unpaid rent did not appear on her credit report.
She was nearly in tears when she heard that she had been approved, but almost lost the apartment when she couldn't provide the security deposit. The church where she had been parking stepped in, ending her homelessness for a little more than $ 2,000.
Ms. Audet and her daughter moved in on Sept. 23. For now she is relishing the simplest of human pleasures -- the ability to drink as much water as she wants, to take a shower in a space that is fully hers and to stretch out when she sleeps. Her tennis shoes fit again. Yet the math of her life remains precarious. Her sizable debt continues to carve out her salary, leaving too little for rent.
"I'm always, like, on the edge," said Ms. Audet. "At least I have a car to sit in -- and a safe parking lot to be in."

Used E.V.s Becoming A Good Deal: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The prices of used battery-powered models have fallen sharply, as the supply of cars and trucks has improved.
If you're in the market for an electric vehicle, the time might be right to consider a used one.
The high cost of electric vehicles has long dissuaded many people from buying one. Last year, for example, electric cars and trucks were so popular and supply so limited that waiting lists were common. And some lucky individuals found they could sell their ride for more than they paid for it.
But over the past year, prices of used electric vehicles have fallen significantly. In addition, climate legislation passed in 2022 includes a tax credit to encourage more people to buy used electric cars and trucks.
Auto inflation has eased
Used cars as a whole are around 7 percent less expensive than they were a year ago, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But used battery-powered models are 28 percent less expensive than a year ago, according to Recurrent, a research firm that specializes in the used electric vehicle market.
Shortages of new cars during the pandemic made new and used cars more expensive, as strong demand for new vehicles spilled over into the used market. Now, supply chains and inventories have improved, and new electric vehicles -- and new cars generally -- have become more available.
Tesla, which sells most new electric cars, has cut prices several times this year to attract buyers, forcing other automakers to lower prices and offer promotions. Those cuts have helped to push down used car prices.
Some analysts think used electric car prices could fall further, though perhaps not as fast. Higher interest rates and a strong supply of new vehicles ought to continue driving prices down, according to J.D. Power, a market research firm.
Are electric cars a bad investment?
Most cars depreciate over time. That said, electric cars and trucks are holding their value better today than they did before the pandemic. That's because there are more places to charge these cars and people have become more familiar with them, said David Paris, director of market intelligence at J.D. Power Valuation Services.
If you bought, say, a used BMW i3 in 2019, Mr. Paris said, it retained only around 30 percent of the manufacturer's suggested retail prices after three years. But now the i3 retains more than 50 percent of its value, suggesting that buyers have fewer concerns about the cars and specifically the health of their batteries, the most expensive part of those vehicles.
Liz Najman, a researcher at Recurrent, said most used electric cars were still new enough that their batteries should be covered under warranty. "Most used E.V.s in the country have at least an eight year, 100,000-mile warranty on their battery," she said.
You should still check the health of a car's battery before buying because replacing it can be expensive. Recurrent provides reports on the health of a car's battery, and apps like Leaf Spy and MyGreenVolt allow car owners to monitor their batteries, depending on the model.
You might be eligible for a tax credit
The Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden's climate bill, grants a tax credit of up to $ 4,000 for buying used electric vehicles that cost no more than $ 25,000.
The credit is available to individuals who earn up to $ 75,000 a year and couples who make $ 150,000 or less. According to Recurrent, around 27 percent of the used electric car inventory is eligible for the credit, up from 17 percent last year.
To qualify, a used vehicle has to be at least two years old. Buyers cannot claim the credit more than once every three years. But, unlike with the tax credits for new vehicles, there are no restrictions on where a used electric vehicle is assembled or where the materials in its batteries come from.
More options are available
Before the pandemic, some of the most popular electric vehicles had been on the road for only a few years at most. Among the few electric models often found on the used car lot, many were luxury models like the Tesla Model S, a large sedan, or the Tesla Model X, a three-row sport-utility vehicle.
The market is much bigger and more diverse now. The number of used electric cars for sale has tripled over the past year, according to Recurrent. A recent scroll through used car listings in the New York area showed a wide range of cars, including a Porsche Taycan listed for more than $ 80,000 and Chevrolet, Hyundai and Nissan models selling for less than $ 25,000.
Buying a used electric vehicle might not be right for everyone, especially if you have to drive long distances or live somewhere where charging stations are few and far between. But if you have a place to plug in and don't frequently drive several hundred miles a day, you can get a good deal.

The Costs of Car Ownership Are Straining Finances: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For millions of Americans, cars are a necessity -- to get to work, to carry children around, to buy food. In recent memory, they've also never been as expensive to own.
According to AAA, the average annual cost in the first five years of new-car ownership rose to $ 12,182 this year, from $ 10,728 last year, reflecting increased purchase prices, maintenance costs and finance charges. That's 16 percent of the median household income, before taxes. (The figure includes depreciation.)
What does that look like in the aggregate? About 92 percent of households have at least one car available to them, and 22 percent have at least three. That comes out to about 223 million personal vehicles, and trillions of dollars a year in spending. By contrast, only $ 79 billion was spent on public transportation in 2019 for both capital and operating expenses.
On a personal level, America's dependence on automobiles means hefty bills, the risk of dangerous crashes and stress. And now, even with strong wage growth and elevated savings in recent years, high sticker prices and escalating interest rates are starting to take a toll: The share of borrowers moving into delinquency jumped in late 2022 and early 2023. Personal vehicles often become workers' largest expense, on par with housing, child care and food.
To understand how car owners are coping, we asked five of them to lay out the expenses associated with their cars. They're a lot higher than people sometimes bargain for. For most, there is no alternative. Brent McCulley is a 33-year-old Realtor in Pompano Beach, Fla., whose family of four requires two cars, making the cost of transportation its largest expense.
Mr. McCulley had been getting along all right in Newark, with one Kia Soul among him, his wife and their young daughter. It was stressful, shuttling the toddler to day care and then getting to his office by 8 a.m., but they made it work with enough public transportation to handle in-between trips.
Florida was a different story. Mr. McCulley was born there and always wanted to return, so they moved to Pompano Beach in early 2022. By that time, after some car swaps, they were driving a 2022 Kia Forte, which he leased for $ 294 per month. They had a baby boy and fewer transit options, so they needed to go car shopping again.
"She could walk to Aldi and get groceries," Mr. McCulley said of his wife. "But beyond that, there's only so much you can do."
Mr. McCulley's credit score had taken a hit after he took on debt to finance the move. So he bought a 2019 Kia Sorento from Carvana at a 12 percent interest rate, which would have required paying $ 7,645 in interest over the course of the loan. A few months later, his credit had improved enough for him to refinance at a 6.6 percent rate, which left the monthly payments at $ 577.
That's only a little more than the average monthly payment for used cars, which reached $ 533 in the second quarter this year, according to TransUnion. The average payment for new cars is $ 741. Both are record highs.
Insurance on both of those cars in Florida comes to $ 459. Gas adds $ 200 or so, bringing the total to around $ 1,530 a month. That's about as much as their rent.
And there's maintenance. After spending five years with a 1992 Buick Century that would break down every other week, Mr. McCulley likes to pay more for new or late-model vehicles because they tend to have fewer issues. Still, the Sorento has required about $ 3,000 in maintenance over the past year -- the front brakes had to be replaced, then the back brakes, and then a flat tire.
Mr. McCulley expects this to be a lucrative year at work, with commissions that should amount to about double Pompano Beach's median household income. But with all their expenses -- including the resumption of mandatory student loan payments, and his son's day care -- they're budgeting carefully. His wife decided to take a job at a veterinarian's office to cover all the bills.
For Mr. McCulley, it's an illustration that even for people who look comfortably middle class, car expenses contribute to a feeling of being overwhelmed.
"Whether you're a millionaire trying to figure out how to allocate your taxes, or whether you're making minimum wage," Mr. McCulley said, "it's all struggle in different kinds of ways." Troy Massey is a 29-year-old Amazon driver in Jacksonville, Fla., who needs a car to go even a few miles but keeps getting underwater on car loans.
A few years ago, debts had piled up while Mr. Massey was attending the University of Central Florida; he lost his financial aid and had to drop out. Juggling too many bills, he fell behind on the loan for his 2013 Honda Civic. In the fall of 2021, it was repossessed -- but because he still owed $ 4,800, the loan balance, he had to keep making payments on a car he didn't own.
Mr. Massey spent most of 2022 without a vehicle. It was technically feasible; he lived only a few miles from where he worked, at Walmart. But the bus wasn't reliable, and when he tried to walk or bike, he'd end up soaked in sweat or a sudden downpour. After a while, he'd had enough.
"I just ended up biting the bullet and saying, 'I need to get another car,"' Mr. Massey said. "I know what happened to the last one, but it's a necessity. If we had some kind of rail system or something like that, it'd be fine. But we don't."
This time, though, getting a car was even more expensive. The cheapest reliable car he could find, a Toyota Corolla with 89,000 miles, cost $ 18,240 including taxes and fees. With a 15.2 percent interest rate and an extended warranty, that left him with monthly payments of $ 451. Looking for insurance, he couldn't find anything less than $ 323 a month for the most basic plan.
Soon after, he switched from Walmart to a Winn-Dixie and took a second job working part time at Amazon, a 35-minute drive from his apartment. Gas for those commutes cost about $ 40 per week, bringing the monthly total to nearly $ 1,000, along with occasional maintenance, like the $ 100 for his last oil change and $ 27 to fix a slowly leaking tire.
"For someone who's making a decent income, that might not be as hard," Mr. Massey said. "But for someone like me who's in the middle of trying to change careers making $ 15.50 an hour, it hits you like a truck."
Mr. Massey thought about selling his Corolla and trying to find something even cheaper. The problem is, he still owes about $ 16,000 on the car, and its book value is only about half that, so he'd have to pay off the difference -- again.
That's an increasingly common experience, as the average used-car loan at origination has reached 123 percent of the vehicle's market value, according to TransUnion. And although overall delinquency on auto loans is low, delinquencies have been climbing quickly since interest rates started increasing in 2022.
In August, he switched to a job driving full time for one of Amazon's delivery contractors making $ 18.75 an hour, which comes to about $ 3,000 a month before taxes. Rent for his apartment with roommates is $ 700, leaving little for food and the credit card bills he's still trying to pay off.
Mr. Massey is building his software programming portfolio so he can start applying for jobs that pay more -- at least enough to afford his car. Jennifer Owings is a 48-year-old school administrator in New York City whose two- to three-hour round-trip commute costs more than $ 1,000 a month.
Ms. Owings loves her job, as an assistant principal at a public elementary school in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. She also loves her home on Staten Island, a condominium with a pool that she bought after a divorce a few years ago, and the community she has developed there.
She does not, however, love the commute -- or how much it costs.
She gets in her 2017 Subaru Outback, which she's paying off in $ 328 installments, and leaves at 5:10 a.m., when the 13 miles over the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge and down the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway are mostly clear (but include tolls totaling $ 175 a month). The afternoon commute is tricky; if she waits too long, it can take two hours. "Any Friday in June, forget about it," Ms. Owings said.
Some expenses are occasional, like maintenance, which Ms. Owings estimates at $ 50 a month on average. So far insurance has covered major damage, like the crash in 2021 that put the car in the shop for weeks, but it costs $ 232 a month. Even minor needs add up, like registration this year, which was $ 138. She's also enrolled in a monthly unlimited carwash plan, which costs $ 23.95.
Parking is the only thing that's free, and some older staff members at her school even drive from Long Island. "I'd say the under-30 crew probably doesn't have their own cars because they can't afford to -- it's too expensive," Ms. Owings said.
She could take a pay cut and return to teaching in a school closer to her house on Staten Island, and save some of the $ 200 a month she spends on gas. But a good boss, leadership opportunities and a school she likes are hard to give up. And public transportation?
"It would actually be faster to take my own kayak -- or to run," said Ms. Owings, who competes in marathons. Instead, as much as she enjoys having the time to catch up with friends, spending continuous hours in a car every day has given her hip pain. "Other people have old sports injuries," she said. "I have a commuting injury." Aydee Joya is a 56-year-old Uber driver living in Arlington, Va., who barely breaks even after accounting for all her expenses.
Technically, Ms. Joya's car is her job, but sometimes it feels as if she's working just to pay for it.
Ms. Joya immigrated from El Salvador as a child and worked for 26 years as a bilingual family assistant in public schools. When her job was eliminated in 2018, a friend told her that driving for taxi apps was a good way to make money on her own schedule, so she started driving for Uber in her 2014 Nissan Rogue.
It worked out all right for a while, and she enjoyed driving. But Ms. Joya quickly learned how many costs are involved in ferrying people around, along with the $ 235 she spends in gas per week.
First came a spent battery, followed by oil changes, tires punctured by potholes, seats soiled by passengers' vomit. In July and August, routine maintenance, including a tire alignment and transmission flush, came to $ 1,433.
"There are things that people don't know that are involved with their car," Ms. Joya said. "We use the brakes all the time. You need to do a lot of repairs, not only tires, not only oil change. All the things inside the car get damaged."
As many ride-hailing drivers do for their protection, she installed a camera in the car at her expense. County property taxes on her vehicle come to $ 566 per year, tolls add about $ 32 a month, and she faces occasional speeding tickets.
Insurance costs $ 603 for six months. In 2022, despite often driving 12 hours a day, she said she made only $ 12,000 after expenses.
In early 2023, as she drove to pick up a passenger, her car was rear-ended. The Nissan was totaled, and Ms. Joya was left with slicing back pain that has made it difficult to drive for long stretches.
Now she drives a 2020 Honda HR-V with a monthly loan payment of $ 536. To make matters worse, she said, Uber isn't paying as much on her fares as it used to. (Uber said drivers' average earnings per hour that they were engaged with a passenger -- that is, not counting time between fares -- had risen since 2019.)
"I'm spending my own money for Uber," while the company makes the profit, Ms. Joya said.
Ms. Joya has thought about moving on from Uber, and at the urging of her husband -- a retired construction worker who worries about her being out late, with several high-profile reports of violence toward ride-hailing drivers recently -- earned a certificate to become a clinical medical assistant. But she hasn't found a job yet, so she keeps driving. Cyndy Knighton is a 58-year-old transportation engineer for the City of Tukwila, Wash., who suffered several car accidents over the past year and a half.
Transportation didn't cost that much for Ms. Knighton, who drove a paid-off 2009 Nissan Altima hybrid -- until April 2022, when a teenager driving on a learner's permit made a left turn in front of her. She broke a wrist and her sternum in the collision, and the car was totaled.
An insurance payout covered the cost of a 14-year-old Subaru and immediately needed repairs, but the vehicle switch subjected her to spiking gasoline prices that she had mostly avoided with her hybrid; the new car required about $ 163 per month to fuel.
In search of a longer-term solution, Ms. Knighton decided to order a new hybrid Toyota Highlander that could handle her steep driveway even during the rare snow and transport her four Samoyeds, which she breeds and occasionally enters in dog shows.
That car, however, got snarled in pandemic supply chain issues. The 2022 edition was converted into a 2023, with a slightly higher base price. Then in March, Ms. Knighton was hit again -- her Subaru was rear-ended on Interstate 5 heading into Seattle, resulting in a concussion and another wrecked vehicle.
This time, with used cars in short supply, she paid about $ 8,200 -- more than the $ 6,200 insurance payout -- to buy a 2001 Highlander with poor gas mileage. To add additional insurance protection, she's now paying $ 158 a month in premiums.
Treatment for her injuries has racked up more than $ 86,000 in medical bills, which her employer's health insurance has covered, other than her $ 750 in co-payments. In September, after more than a year of wrangling with her car insurance company, she finally heard she would receive insurance payouts worth $ 80,000 after lawyers' fees.
That will be enough to buy the new Highlander outright, at $ 62,350 including taxes. But Ms. Knighton would never have chosen to finance a new car that way. Aside from the pain and continuing physical therapy, the psychic trauma of repeated accidents takes its own toll. Small shocks on the road -- like when she had to slam on the brakes recently, sending one of her dogs into the windshield -- can bring on tears.
"I get the irony, that I'm a transportation professional and I'm afraid to drive," Ms. Knighton said. "To have that lurking there, that could break through at any random time for any reason, is debilitating. It's an emotional, intellectual cost that is intangible."

I Deliver Supplies to Ukrainian Troops: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This past summer, Britain's defense minister at the time, Ben Wallace, chided Ukraine for not showing enough gratitude for the West's weapons supplies. "We're not Amazon," he said.
No, but there is a kind of Amazon for the Ukrainian military, in analog form: a network of civilian volunteer groups that deliver an array of goods to soldiers in the field, on request.
I know because I'm one of those volunteers. We deliver tourniquets, chest seals for lung wounds, observation drones, night vision monoculars, power banks, underwear and feet warmers, all within a few days. A secondhand four-wheel-drive vehicle or a thermal drone takes a little longer, up to two weeks.
Volunteerism has played a powerful role in Ukraine's recent history. Volunteers maintained the barricades during the 2014 revolution on Maidan Square, and many of the fighters resisting the Russian move into Donbas later that year were civilians. When Russia launched its full invasion in 2022, large numbers of Ukrainians volunteered to fight. Millions of Ukrainians have in turn mobilized to support those men and women: An opinion poll conducted that summer, when the economy was already suffering from Russian attacks, found 86 percent of Ukrainians had donated to charities and 33 percent were actively volunteering.
Supplying the army quickly, often with imported items, could not easily be done otherwise: The military's lingering post-Soviet bureaucracy makes reacting to its own soldiers' needs difficult. Soldiers get kitted out with gear when they sign up, but lost or damaged items, from socks to helmets, are not automatically replaced. The Defense Ministry is busy dealing with big-ticket items, distributing tanks and heavy weapons coming in from all over the world.
That's how we, the volunteers, ended up fund-raising and supplying so many essential bits and pieces through ad hoc arrangements with parts of the Ukrainian military. In the grand scheme of things, our individual efforts are minuscule, but they are lifesaving all the same.
Two of the biggest nonstate volunteer groups, Come Back Alive and the Serhiy Prytula Charitable Foundation, provide cars and armored vehicles, night- and thermal-vision instruments, drones and other items to the army. Odesa-based Wave91 alone supplies hundreds of Chinese-made Mavic camera drones and fabricates thousands of first-person-view drones.
My most recent delivery was to the 3017th Military Unit of the Ukrainian National Guard.
The 3017th fought for some five months in Bakhmut this year and was recently stationed near Zolochiv, north of Kharkiv, 10 miles from the Russian border. With this information in hand, I start off in a Mitsubishi pickup truck bought in Britain with money raised in Poland. The steering wheel is on the right side, but I learned to drive British-style vehicles on my last delivery, a Nissan pickup that I took to soldiers in Odesa.
I pick up the vehicle in Berlin. On the Polish side of the Rava Ruska border crossing into Ukraine, I am waved through. On the Ukrainian side, the customs officers know me from previous deliveries, so things go smoothly there, too. An hour later in Lviv I meet up with Olga Shpak, a biologist specializing in whales who abandoned her research, friends and apartment in Moscow two days before the invasion to return to her native Kharkiv. She now is a representative there for another volunteer group, Assist Ukraine, co-founded by the retired NPR journalist Anne Garrels.
Small and flexible groups like these are crucial in this war because the big international humanitarian organizations shy away from anything remotely military. Even a lifesaving tourniquet smells martial to them. But, as Ms. Garrels said soon after the invasion, Ukrainians "don't need teddy bears, they need flak jackets."
Ms. Shpak is a one-stop supplier for the military units she knows. Their needs range from dry showers and insect repellent to night-vision devices. She finds the product on the market -- in Ukraine or abroad, via the producer or online -- and buys it with funds from Assist Ukraine or similar groups, and then organizes the delivery. "Can you urgently find a sturdy pickup for the 3017th?" she had texted me. Soon, it was in the unit's shopping cart.
Now, in a convoy of two we go -- a whale expert and a writer -- to Zolochiv to hand over the Mitsubishi and tourniquets to the National Guard unit. Ms. Shpak deals with paperwork for the vehicle, while I am given a tour of the unit's living quarters by Dima, the 26-year-old commander of the 150-soldier unit. We film a short "thank you" video of the vehicle's transfer for the main donors. Volunteer work is based on mutual trust, so filming deliveries is a form of accountability.
Along with being an accidental procurement assistant, I am also a fund-raiser: I raise money from a motley group. I reached out to Swedes through a Stockholm-based journalist. A Jewish group from New York contributed over $ 5,000. An exiled Russian-born film director and her colleagues sent even more. An Australian friend reached out to a wealthy acquaintance, who wired $ 5,000 on his way to visit Antarctica.
The next morning, back in Kharkiv, we swing by Ms. Shpak's warehouse, where she has squirreled away all sorts of goodies: medicine, uniforms, backpacks, flashlights, batteries, binoculars. She prepares herself like a military Santa Claus, stuffing boxes and bags with what she will distribute to the soldiers. She assigns me the task of sorting by size 100 colorful boxer briefs sewn by Ukrainian refugees in Austria.
That afternoon, we drive about three hours to Kramatorsk, where we meet our first taker: Gena, a former hair dye producer, who is now a soldier in the 225th Battalion. Along with some boxers, he takes power banks and special multilayered survival blankets that serve not so much to provide warmth as to conceal positions from the Russians' thermal cameras. The star of this delivery is a Mavic-3 drone that I bought on eBay in the United States.
Recently, units' requests have been getting more eclectic -- and more desperate. For my next delivery, we are now shopping for four-pronged spider boots, which provide some protection from mines, and hoverboards, which can be used to build demining robots. Both items point to the increasingly urgent effort to reduce injuries and deaths from Russian mines.
I for one have never seen a war effort -- and I have reported on several dozen conflicts -- relying so much on volunteerism, although a similar spirit fueled the Solidarity revolution in my native Poland.
The Ukrainians are committed because their lives depend on it. In order not to run out of people to defend their country, they do whatever they can to support those on the front lines. So, many civilians in Ukraine find it easier to be volunteers than to do nothing at all.
As for me, a journalist who has thrown impartiality to the winds, I feel a little less guilty knowing I tried to do something to stop this madness. So once in a while I bring supplies, always for small groups, always items that were specifically requested. I'm just fulfilling orders.

'Life-Threatening Rainfall Event' Slams Region: [Live Blog Post]

Full text: Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency, as flash floods stranded commuters and inundated roads and subways.
Heavy rainfall pounded New York City and the surrounding region on Friday, bringing flash floods, shutting down entire subway lines, turning major roadways into lakes and sending children to the upper floors of flooding schoolhouses. Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency, urging New Yorkers to stay home and singling out those who live in basements to brace for the worst.
State and city leaders implored residents not to underestimate a storm that flipped from falling rain to fire-hose torrents in minutes. Ms. Hochul called it a "life-threatening rainfall event," and Mayor Eric Adams called the storm "something that we cannot take lightly and we are not taking lightly." The city's residents, while largely caught by surprise, took heed and many stayed home and off the roads.
Citywide cellphone pings pushed alerts from the National Weather Service throughout the day, repeatedly extending a "considerable" flash-flood warning, a level reserved for extreme and rare rainfall events.
The warning remained in effect through the evening, and the governor cautioned at a news conference against driving despite a lull in the storm. The rain was unpredictable, she said, and it wasn't entirely clear what areas would be hardest hit overnight.
Throughout the day, cascading waterfalls shut down subway lines across much of the city, with service being halted even at major hubs like Barclays Center. Trains were rerouted with little warning.
"I have no idea what's happening," one subway conductor said as her Q train moved onto the E line. "I don't know where we're going."
Commuters turned and ventured back home on foot through scenes of chaos and upheaval.
Water gushed into brownstone basements in Park Slope. In Prospect Park, the landscape was altered by new creeks. In Queens, the storm was generational, making Friday the wettest day at Kennedy International Airport since modern record-keeping began.
The streets in Windsor Terrace in Brooklyn, a neighborhood built on the slant of a hill, were engulfed in minutes in currents dotted with whitecaps, just as schools were opening their doors. Boys and girls slogged through deep water on 11th Avenue to reach their elementary school classes while neighbors with rakes tried to clear storm drains of dense fallen leaves.
"No children are in danger as far as we know," the governor said. But some schools asked parents to return during the storm to pick up their children, which school officials later said was "precisely the wrong thing to do."
"Truthfully, holding school today knowing this was coming feels irresponsible," said Jessamyn Lee, a Brooklyn parent of two.
By the end of the day, the overall attendance rate at public schools fell to roughly 77 percent, after hovering around 90 percent earlier this week. Several dozen schools across Brooklyn in particular saw more than 4 in 10 students absent.
The sense that city leaders were largely caught off guard promised to linger after the rain had stopped falling. Mayor Adams was swiftly criticized for not warning residents about the storm soon enough, and for waiting to address New Yorkers until noontime Friday.
Scenes both placid and fraught played out in the city, depending on how hard the rain was falling. Waist-high rivers appeared beneath arched bridges in Central Park. A man in a drenched business suit leaned on a fence by the Great Lawn, and removed his boots one at a time to empty them of water.
In Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, a large tree fell, pulling its roots up through a sidewalk and cleaving a parked Nissan. In Windsor Terrace, Bryn Knowles, a former city parks employee in Lake Oswego, Ore., felt her instincts from that rain-soaked region kick in. She picked up a rake and went out to a blocked drain on the corner.
"Every major rain event, all the city workers would drop all their tasks, grab their rakes and go and clear storm drains," she said. "It's fun -- it's instant gratification, it helps people."
Attention immediately turned to residents who live in flood zones, two years after the remnants of Hurricane Ida caused basement floods that killed 11 people in Queens. Many of those apartments, which are often rented to immigrants or others desperate for an affordable place to live, are not allowed to be rented legally and do not have adequate means of escape in a flood.
"Plan your escape route," Ms. Hochul said. "Don't wait until water is over your knees before you leave. Don't wait until it's too late."
The rain on Friday made this the second-wettest September in New York City history, according to National Weather Service statistics: More than a foot of rain -- over 14 inches -- has fallen this month, the most in more than 140 years, when the city logged 16.85 inches in September 1882.
The storm created havoc for the busiest streets and highways, flooding parts of the F.D.R. Drive and closing down the Belt Parkway. Many flights were canceled or delayed at Kennedy and La Guardia.
Over the next few hours, the storm will gradually head east, said Dominic Ramunni, a Weather Service meteorologist. "We've got Manhattan on the western edge of it now, with the heaviest rain over Queens and western Nassau County," he said. But he added, "We're still dealing with it: We still have that fire hose of moisture coming on shore."
In the Central Park Zoo, the storm brought about an escape: The water rose so high that a female sea lion, named Sally, was able to breach her pool and venture out. She did not get far, with the zoo locked down and employees watching her carefully.
Like many New Yorkers on Friday, Sally decided she was better off at home.
"She explored the area before returning to the familiar surroundings of the pool," said Jim Breheny, an executive with the Wildlife Conservation Society, "and the company of the other two sea lions."

NEW YORK — Heavy rainfall pounded New York City and the surrounding region Friday, bringing flash floods, shutting down entire subway lines, turning major roadways into lakes and sending children to the upper floors of flooding schoolhouses. Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency, urging New Yorkers to stay home and singling out those who live in basements to brace for the worst.
State and city leaders implored residents not to underestimate a storm that flipped from falling rain to fire-hose torrents in minutes. Hochul called it a “life-threatening rainfall event,” and Mayor Eric Adams called the storm “something that we cannot take lightly and we are not taking lightly.” The city’s residents, while largely caught by surprise, took heed and many stayed home and off the roads.
Citywide cellphone pings pushed alerts from the National Weather Service throughout the day, repeatedly extending a “considerable” flash-flood warning, a level reserved for extreme and rare rainfall events.
The warning remained in effect through the evening, and the governor cautioned at a news conference against driving despite a lull in the storm. The rain was unpredictable, she said, and it wasn’t entirely clear what areas would be hardest hit overnight.
Throughout the day, cascading waterfalls shut down subway lines across much of the city, with service being halted even at major hubs like Barclays Center. Trains were rerouted with little warning.
“I have no idea what’s happening,” one subway conductor said as her Q train moved onto the E line. “I don’t know where we’re going.”
Commuters turned and ventured back home on foot through scenes of chaos and upheaval.
Water gushed into brownstone basements in Park Slope. In Prospect Park, the landscape was altered by new creeks. In Queens, the storm was generational, making Friday the wettest day at Kennedy International Airport since modern record-keeping began.
The streets in Windsor Terrace in Brooklyn, a neighborhood built on the slant of a hill, were engulfed in minutes in currents dotted with whitecaps, just as schools were opening their doors. Boys and girls slogged through deep water on 11th Avenue to reach their elementary school classes while neighbors with rakes tried to clear storm drains of dense fallen leaves.
“No children are in danger as far as we know,” the governor said. But some schools asked parents to return during the storm to pick up their children, which school officials later said was “precisely the wrong thing to do.”
“Truthfully, holding school today knowing this was coming feels irresponsible,” said Jessamyn Lee, a Brooklyn parent of two.
By the end of the day, the overall attendance rate at public schools fell to roughly 77%, after hovering around 90% earlier this week. Several dozen schools across Brooklyn in particular saw more than 4 in 10 students absent.
The sense that city leaders were largely caught off guard promised to linger after the rain had stopped falling. Adams was swiftly criticized for not warning residents about the storm soon enough, and for waiting to address New Yorkers until noontime Friday.
Scenes both placid and fraught played out in the city, depending on how hard the rain was falling. Waist-high rivers appeared beneath arched bridges in Central Park. A man in a drenched business suit leaned on a fence by the Great Lawn, and removed his boots one at a time to empty them of water.
In Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, a large tree fell, pulling its roots up through a sidewalk and cleaving a parked Nissan. In Windsor Terrace, Bryn Knowles, a former city parks employee in Lake Oswego, Oregon, felt her instincts from that rain-soaked region kick in. She picked up a rake and went out to a blocked drain on the corner.
“Every major rain event, all the city workers would drop all their tasks, grab their rakes and go and clear storm drains,” she said. “It’s fun — it’s instant gratification, it helps people.”
Attention immediately turned to residents who live in flood zones, two years after the remnants of Hurricane Ida caused basement floods that killed 11 people in Queens. Many of those apartments, which are often rented to immigrants or others desperate for an affordable place to live, are not allowed to be rented legally and do not have adequate means of escape in a flood.
“Plan your escape route,” Hochul said. “Don’t wait until water is over your knees before you leave. Don’t wait until it’s too late.”
The rain Friday made this the second-wettest September in New York City history, according to weather service statistics: More than a foot of rain — over 14 inches — has fallen this month, the most in more than 140 years, when the city logged 16.85 inches in September 1882 .

Strikes and Deep Roots: 'Good Stories in Detroit': [National Desk]

Full text: As electric vehicles usher in a new era for the car economy and workers strike against rooted manufacturers, Neal E. Boudette is in Motor City to cover it all.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
For the first time in the nearly 90-year history of the United Auto Workers, the union is on strike against all three of the large Detroit automakers -- General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler -- at the same time.
The targeted strike, which started on Sept. 15 and expanded last Friday, has shut down three auto plants in Michigan, Ohio and Missouri, and 38 parts distribution centers operated by G.M. and Stellantis. About 18,300 U.A.W. members are on strike while the union demands a 40 percent pay increase. The shutdowns affect only a few car models, but a protracted strike would affect consumers and the U.S. economy.
Neal E. Boudette, who covers the auto industry from Detroit for The New York Times, has been reporting on the negotiations between the union and automakers. He has covered the automobile industry since 2002, when he was in Germany working for The Wall Street Journal. He joined The Times in 2016.
In an interview, Mr. Boudette spoke about the evolution of the industry, its symbolism in the United States and what this strike could mean for other automakers. This interview has been edited and condensed.
President Biden visited a picket line in Michigan this week, which has been described as unprecedented for a sitting president. Does this strike feel different from U.A.W.'s strike at General Motors in 2019, or ones before that?
A lot of the strikes in the past 20 years have been symbolic more than strategic. This year, it's a totally different dynamic. The union has a very strong negotiating position. The car companies are making tons of money, and workers have not received raises that have kept up with inflation. The workers have a lot of support from the public.
There have been strikes in the past that were very contentious and even resulted in street clashes. But in the 21st century, there hasn't been a strike like this.
You worked in Germany before coming to Detroit. How do the settings compare?
Detroit is Motor City. The whole region has this very strong connection to automobiles. There's a century-long history and a great deal of culture built around the automobile. The Detroit Red Wings -- their logo is a winged wheel.
It was less so in Germany. I was based in Frankfurt, not an auto center. Opel was a little bit outside of Frankfurt, and Mercedes was south of Frankfurt. B.M.W. was down in Munich; Volkswagen was up north in Wolfsburg. Each of those towns is a little like Detroit, but you didn't have the concentration that you have in Detroit.
How has the evolution of electric vehicles changed your beat?
The biggest trend is electrification, and there are many different aspects of it. Aside from the fact that you have to get these cars designed and developed and produced, there's a social aspect to it. We need chargers all over the place, and charging a car is a different social experience than filling up your gas tank.
Then there's the climate aspect. The evolution of the industry to electronic vehicles has been called the biggest transition the industry has seen since the introduction of the moving assembly line.
The beat is multifaceted now. Before the financial crisis, it wasn't quite like that. There was a technology race, but it was a very limited technology race. And now it's taking on a much greater breadth.
What affects will the strike have on the industry?
Eventually the union and automakers will come up with an agreement. And then the next big question will be: How much of a burden does this contract put on these companies? Their competitors -- Toyota, Volkswagen, Honda, Kia -- are foreign companies who operate nonunion factories. Most of their workers make considerably less than the top U.A.W. wage.
In recent years, U.A.W. tried to organize a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee and a Nissan plant in Mississippi, and the workers voted down union representation. They didn't want to rock the boat.
But there's a lot of power on the side of workers these days. I think it's possible workers in the South say: We're making $ 22 an hour. The workers in Detroit are making $ 32 an hour. We should be in the union.
As an auto industry reporter, are you a big car guy?
It's funny, I'm not. I'm interested in cars, but I'm not a big car person. I drive a Chevy Malibu, believe it or not.
Cars are interesting products to cover. There's no other country in the world where there are as many pop songs and movies about cars. The Beach Boys' "409"; that David Hasselhoff TV show, "Knight Rider." It's a whole TV show built around a car.
There are good stories in Detroit. Sometimes it's a matter of explaining things to readers. We did a lot of that in the past year on the transition to E.V.s. There are also really interesting personalities to write about. That's what keeps me going.

Production Is Restarting At a Critical Drug Plant
A major Pfizer pharmaceutical plant in Rocky Mount, N.C., that makes critical supplies for U.S. hospitals has restarted production about 10 weeks after it was heavily damaged by a tornado, the company announced on Monday.
The plant produces anesthesia and other drugs as well as nearly one-fourth of the sterile injectable medications Pfizer supplies to U.S. hospitals, the company said.
Full production across the facility's three manufacturing sites is expected by the end of the year.
Thirteen medicines were prioritized based on patient need and inventory levels and are now back in production on the lines that have restarted, Pfizer said. The medicines are expected to ship to distribution centers in the fourth quarter of this year.
Although manufacturing has resumed, the company said some medicines may not be back in full supply until next year. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Lego Drops One Attempt At Recycling but not Goal
Lego, the world's largest toymaker, said on Monday that it remains committed to finding sustainable materials to reduce carbon emissions, even after an experiment by the company to use recycled bottles did not work. Lego said it has "decided not to progress" with making its trademark colorful bricks from recycled plastic bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate, known as PET. After more than two years of testing, the company said, it "found the material didn't reduce carbon emissions."
Still, the toymaker remains "fully committed to making Lego bricks from sustainable materials by 2032," it said.
Two years ago, the privately-held group, which makes its bricks out of oil-based plastic, started researching a potential transition to recycled plastic bottles made of PET plastic, which doesn't degrade in quality when recycled. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Nissan to Go All Electric For Cars Sold in Europe
Nissan said on Monday that as of now, all new models that it introduces in Europe will be fully electric and that it plans to sell only electric vehicles on the continent by 2030.
The Japanese carmaker said one of two new electric models that it had already confirmed for Europe would be manufactured at its Sunderland plant in England.
Earlier this year, Nissan raised its targets for electric models as it plays catch-up in a segment dominated by newcomers, saying it would introduce 19 by 2030.
Nissan previously said that by its 2026 fiscal year, ending on March 31, 2027, 98 percent of its sales in Europe would be electrified - either fully electric cars or hybrids, which have both a large battery and a combustion engine.
The new goal of going fully electric in Europe by 2030 brings Nissan in line with its alliance partner, Renault, which plans to make the brand all electric by then. REUTERS

The Rising Costs of Owning a Car: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Everything is going up -- buying, financing, insurance and maintenance. The average annual cost of ownership, by one estimate, is $ 12,000.
It's getting more expensive to own and operate a new car.
The average annual cost of ownership is up more than 13 percent from last year to more than $ 12,000, or just over $ 1,000 a month, according to the latest research from the automobile owners group AAA. Higher car prices and the surging costs of financing, insuring and maintaining a new car all contributed to the increase. The analysis also considered depreciation a cost even though it's not paid out of pocket.
Where does that leave consumers who are already squeezed by rising gas prices, the higher costs for food and other goods, as well as increasing interest rates on their credit cards?
Drivers should consider their true needs and driving habits when choosing a vehicle, said Greg Brannon, director of automotive research for AAA. "It's really up to your specific situation."
The average cost per mile for a vehicle driven 15,000 miles a year is about 81 cents, AAA says. But it's $ 1.06 for a popular half-ton pickup truck like a Chevrolet Silverado. If you need a truck only occasionally to haul mulch from the garden center, it might make sense to buy a smaller car -- say, a compact sport utility vehicle like a Nissan Rogue -- at about 67 cents per mile and rent a truck when you really need one.
"It's very expensive to own a pickup that you only use as a pickup once or twice a year," Mr. Brannon said.
The cheapest option is a small sedan, at about 60 cents a mile, AAA found. For shoppers, however, it may be challenging to find lower-priced sedans on dealer lots, said Benjamin Preston, an automotive reporter at Consumer Reports. That's because automakers have been emphasizing production of more profitable models, like big S.U.V.s and trucks with lots of extra features, he said.
While new car inventories are improving, Mr. Preston said, "if you're looking for an affordable car, it's a tough time." If you can wait a few months for delivery, you can order the specific model you want -- without extra bells and whistles -- through a dealer, he said.
While used car prices have moderated, Mr. Preston said, higher interest rates, particularly for older, lower-priced models, may make them more expensive to buy. According to Experian Automotive, which tracks automobile financing, the average interest rate for a used car loan rose to 11.38 percent from 8.84 percent last year, while the average payment rose to $ 528 from $ 519.
According to an analysis from iSeeCars.com, an online car search site, buyers with a $ 23,000 budget could buy a three-year-old car in 2019, but the same amount is not enough for the average six-year-old car today.
If you do choose an older used car, Mr. Preston said -- five years old or more -- keep in mind that it is unlikely to be covered by a manufacturer's warranty. So choose a model with a history of reliability and have a mechanic check it out before buying.
The average price of the new cars included in AAA's 2023 study, based on the manufacturer's suggested retail price, is about $ 35,000, up 4.7 percent from last year, while the average annual finance charge almost doubled, to $ 1,253, AAA found. The report projects new cars will depreciate by an average of $ 4,538 per year over five years of ownership, up 24 percent over 2022.
(The higher depreciation reflects the slipping used car prices and high new car prices. "You pay more, but it's worth less," Mr. Brannon of AAA said.)
The report, based on information from the automotive data researcher Vincentric and other sources, used the five most popular 2023 models in nine categories, excluding luxury cars. It estimates the cost of using a new car over five years and 75,000 miles, considering costs for fuel and maintenance, insurance, license and registration fees, taxes, and depreciation. It doesn't include the cost of parking, which can add hundreds or thousands of dollars to the cost of car ownership if you live in a big city.
Other analyses show new-car prices to be even higher. Kelley Blue Book, a unit of Cox Automotive, said the average transaction price for a new car -- what buyers actually pay -- was about $ 48,500 in August, roughly flat with a year earlier, held in check by growing inventories and incentives like cash-back rebates. (Kelley's figure includes luxury cars, like those from Audi and Mercedes-Benz, which have raised prices.)
One unknown is the possible effect on car prices of the United Automobile Workers strike. The strike isn't expected to affect consumer prices in the near term, according to Cox Automotive, but prices could rise if the strike lasts long enough to affect the supply of new vehicles.
Here are some questions and answers about managing car costs:
What are current interest rates on new car loans?
The average interest rate for a new-car loan rose to 6.63 percent in the second quarter this year from 4.6 percent a year earlier, according to Experian Automotive. More borrowers are choosing shorter-term loans, said Melinda Zabritski, head of automotive finance insights at Experian, because shoppers can usually get lower rates on shorter-term loans, and because carmakers are offering extra incentives on those loans. A shorter loan reduces the overall expense but increases the size of monthly payments.
The average monthly new-car payment rose to $ 729 from $ 672 in the second quarter. Maintaining a good credit score can help you get a better rate on your car loan.
My auto insurance premium is increasing. What can I do?
Car insurance costs are rising as insurers face higher losses for accidents, repairs and natural disasters. In some cases, according to the consumer research firm J.D. Power, drivers are skipping coverage, even though most states require minimum coverage, because they can't afford premiums. The number of households with at least one car that said they didn't have auto insurance rose to 5.7 percent in the first half of 2023, from 5.3 percent in the second half of 2022. (J.D. Power said it did not have data for first half of 2022.)
Drivers should get quotes from several insurers and ask what steps they can take to lower their costs, the company said, such as raising their deductibles -- the amount of a claim they must pay out of pocket.
What about going carless?
As car ownership becomes more costly, you may want to consider if you can get by without one, especially if you live in an urban area with good public transportation or wide availability of ride-sharing services. Zipcar, a unit of Avis Budget Group, says members can save thousands of dollars annually by using its self-service car rentals.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A 7-year-old boy, his mom and grandparents tried to flee Hawaii's deadliest wildfire in over a century, and ran into impossible challenges.
The wind had never felt so fierce.
Folau Tone steadied himself as a gale whipped through his street in Lahaina. Trying to nail down the rattling tin roof on his family's home, he gave up as fragments were stripped away.
In West Maui, power lines were crashing down, and the electricity was out across a large swath of the island. Outdoor furniture and debris were flung across yards.
Folau's wife had already left for her job at a hotel, but their four children had stayed behind. It was Aug. 8, what would have been the first day of school. Classes were canceled because of the power outage.
The gusts did not deter his mother, Faaoso, who stood outside fussing over a pot of cassava root while another pot burbled with fish stew. She liked cooking in the open air and had long ago set up a makeshift kitchen with propane burners under a tent.
At 70, Faaoso enjoyed overseeing a home that bustled, happy to live with children and grandchildren over the years. Her husband, Maluifonua, 73, was retired, having suffered a back injury when a linen cart slipped while he was working at a resort.
Folau and his family moved in seven years ago, joining his sister Salote, 39, and her son, Tony Takafua. The siblings helped pay the mortgage.
At about 2 p.m., Folau showered and was preparing to leave for his job as a bartender when he received word that the restaurant was not going to open. He figured that he and his kids would hole up for the day.
But smoke began to swirl outside their home, a white bungalow with blue trim. Neighbors came outside to peer up at the mountains, their shouts drowned out by the wind. Some headed for their cars.
Folau, 44, had evacuated under threat of fire before, and he told his children to pack a change of clothes. The smoke soon thickened and darkened the sky. Folau found his footsteps quickening, his voice growing urgent.
His daughter Liliana, 14, jumped into the front seat of their silver truck, a Nissan Titan. Siosiua, 9, and Auralia, 5, crawled in the back seat. So did their 2-year-old brother, Keuli, and Nala, their Labrador mix.
Salote and Tony, 7, hopped into the white Honda Civic that she had recently purchased. Her parents climbed in the back. The plan was to follow Folau and meet at his wife's hotel.
Before leaving, Folau grabbed the two pots of food his mother had made and rushed to place them in the trunk of Salote's car. It would be nice to show up with a meal if there was no working electricity.
A new life on Maui
Maluifonua and Faaoso Tone had once been farmers in Tonga where they grew taro and breadfruit and raised horses, cows and goats. They were often seen side by side in the field, an unusually inseparable pair.
In 1995, the couple planned to move to San Francisco to join a family member whose stories had made them dream of an American life. On the way, they stopped to visit Faaoso's brother on Maui and decided to stay for good because the island reminded them of home. They had four children at the time and would soon adopt a fifth.
Maluifonua took a job as a dishwasher at a tavern called the Rusty Harpoon, working so late that he would miss the last bus and have to walk the four miles home.
He and his wife found comfort in the Polynesian community and were active in the local Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They attended socials and barbecues and spent afternoons at the congregation's farm, tending to rows of yam plants and banana trees.
Maluifonua was a natural leader, and friends requested that he coordinate the kitchen at weddings and parties where it was not unusual to welcome a few hundred people. Faaoso was quieter, more comfortable looking after the household. Many looked forward to her version of lu pulu, which involved steaming corned beef or lamb with coconut milk in taro leaves.
The couple often watched over the children of relatives or neighbors, offering relief to numerous working parents. "They never complained about people bringing their kids, they were always willing," Folau said.
Their modest house was near the ocean on a street lush with plumeria and coconut trees, and it became a landing place for relatives who had just moved to Maui.
Folau was their middle child and, after his older brother moved to Utah, the only son on the island. He had been a shy 15-year-old when he left Tonga and enrolled at Lahainaluna High School. There, he excelled at math and considered going to college.
But Folau remembered watching his older sister contributing her McDonald's paychecks to the house. He thought it best to join the work force and help with his parents' bills.
Over the years, Folau juggled jobs as a dishwasher, cook and server. He bartended, worked security, greeted travelers at zip-line tours.
It was not a life of regret. He felt a solemn sense of responsibility for the family.
A frantic escape
Inside his truck, Folau did not see the fire, but could feel the encroaching heat as he gripped the steering wheel. He started down Kuhua Street. Salote followed. The neighborhood was shrouded in gray, and wind was hurling embers, leaves and dirt in the air.
A fallen mango tree blocked access to the main thoroughfare that could get them out of the area. Vehicles were changing direction, jamming the road. Folau turned onto Aki Street, but drivers motioned that there was no outlet there, either. He turned back to Kuhua Street. Cars were trying to maneuver around one another but getting nowhere. He was trapped.
"Dad, get us out of here!" Liliana, his daughter, begged.
Alongside the street ran a metal fence. Another truck began ramming into it, futilely trying to break it down. Finally, the driver got out and started running, leaving his vehicle behind.
Folau scanned for another means of escape. "At the time, I wasn't thinking of anything -- just feeling that the kids were there and just trying to get them somewhere safe," he said.
He found himself back by the fallen mango tree. Maybe, Folau thought, he could wedge his truck against the side of the fence, force his wheels over the branches and break through to the other side.
Nearby homes began to ignite. The inside of Folau's truck grew hotter. He could barely see through the windshield. His children clung to one another and screamed.
"I just heard my kids crying. And then I just went for it."
He gunned the engine. His sister Salote, he hoped, was close behind.
'I love you to the end of me'
Salote Tone had a bold personality that some could find brash. But she tried not to spend time worrying about what people thought of her. She considered herself a work in progress and had empathy for anyone with a personal struggle.
"She could be sassy in people's eyes, but if you got to know her, she was really humble," her friend Fipe Fononga, 41, said. "She was my ride or die. If I'm in trouble or need help, she was there."
Salote helped Fipe land a job at a rental car agency. When Fipe had difficulty affording rent, Salote invited her to live with the family, sharing her bedroom.
"She never judged people, she tried to offer inspiration," said her friend Tiffany Tevaga, who wrestled with alcoholism for years and spent time in prison for assault. After Tiffany turned things around and began a home business braiding hair, Salote was her right hand, booking appointments and posting advertisements.
"Oh, she was so proud of me," Tiffany, 35, said. "I like to say I'm the muscle -- and Lote was the heart."
Salote had been a manager at Cheeseburger in Paradise, a well-known hangout, but eventually managed vacation-home rentals.
She loved to be social, staying out until sunrise with her girlfriends -- avoiding venues where she might find herself under the watchful eye of her big brother Folau.
When her son was born, Salote's world grew smaller and more focused. Tony became her shadow, her "Boobear" and "lil mini," and she was unabashed in her affection for him.
"I love you to the end of me, and I can never thank you enough for being my lifesaver," she wrote in April on her Facebook page.
The two spent days at the beach where Tony jumped off cliffs. He had a passion for football and video games, and liked riding electric bikes around the neighborhood with his cousins. He smiled whenever posing in a ta'ovala, his traditional Tongan dress, and often went to church with his grandparents. More than once, Tony raised money for children with heart problems, adding what he had earned from the tooth fairy and chores around the house.
During the first weekend of August, he and his mother visited Oahu where Tiffany was offering free braiding for a lower-income community. Salote joined in, brushing people's hair while her son clung to her side. They returned to Maui on the night of Aug. 7, although they had nearly missed their flight while scrambling to find Tony new football cleats.
He was starting second grade at Princess Nahienaena Elementary School the next day.
A valley of cinders
As flames tore through the heart of Lahaina, those elsewhere on Maui had little immediate information.
Folau's wife, Sabrina, was working the front desk at the Westin Kaanapali Ocean Resort Villas about four miles away, and trying to calm guests complaining about the power outage. Smoke was twisting through the sky outside.
Sabrina, 44, began receiving texts from her eldest, Liliana. But cell service was shoddy, and each message was one word.
"mom"
"please"
"answer"
Sabrina took a break to drive to Folau's restaurant and was relieved he had not shown up. It meant he was very likely with their children.
Finally, around 5 p.m., her husband appeared in the lobby, his face ashen. Guests were around, so he quietly told her to walk outside.
There she saw that the front and sides of his truck were scraped and battered. An electrical wire was tangled underneath. Liliana grabbed her and cried. Her other children and the dog were safe inside the truck.
An administrator at the hotel would later recall the scene as one of the first clues that something was terribly wrong in Lahaina.
Folau was anxious to retrace his steps to search for his sister's car, but the roads were impassable. Calls and texts went unanswered. Across the island, thousands had been displaced and separated. Sabrina's manager offered the family a hotel room for the night.
By morning, Folau had still not heard from his parents or Salote. The next day, he found a way to get into the burn area with his brother-in-law and a friend.
They saw a valley of cinders and burned dreams. Most of the homes were ash and rubble, some marked only by concrete steps to nowhere. Folau's own home had disappeared into dust, nothing left to be saved.
Cars with melted tires dotted the street, their metal frames nearly unrecognizable.
But one had a bent hood as if it had slammed into something. It also held a devastating detail: two scorched metal pots.
'Where is Tony?'
It has been more than a month since the fire, and dozens of victims have yet to be identified. The authorities count the total lives lost at 115, but many residents are convinced there are more. And there are still 66 names on a list of the missing.
Forensic experts and search teams combed through the rubble for weeks looking for any semblance of human remains. Families who have provided their DNA still wait for closure.
Folau knew before the officials: Faaoso, Maluifonua, Salote and Tony had died in their car. Three generations taken by flames they could not outrun. Tony would have celebrated his eighth birthday next month, the youngest victim to be identified so far.
Survivors have deep trauma and complicated mental scars. There are those who cannot speak of what they saw. And plans to restart their lives are outlined in grief.
Folau and his family are staying at a hotel as they figure out what comes next. Wherever they land, the household will feel incomplete.
Siosiua, his 9-year-old, has not yet come up with a good answer when other kids innocently ask, "Where is Tony?"
Folau is grateful to be there for his son in these moments after spending so much of his life working. It has been good to focus on fatherhood.
Like many, he is struggling with the weight of unwarranted guilt. Why his car made it out but his sister's did not. Whether he could have swung around and made sure they pulled through.
His siblings and friends assure him that he is not to blame. His own children speak of his heroism. The way they see it, Folau was their protector, a father fueled by love and desperation racing them out of a terrifying blaze.
And his wife knows the unbearable alternative: "If he had gone back, we would have lost them all."

Full text: A looming auto industry strike could test the president's commitment to making electric vehicles a source of well-paying union jobs.
President Biden has been highly attuned to the politics of electric vehicles, helping to enact billions in subsidies to create new manufacturing jobs and going out of his way to court the United Automobile Workers union.
But as the union and the big U.S. automakers -- General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, Jeep and Ram -- hurtle toward a strike deadline set for Thursday night, the political challenge posed by the industry's transition to electric cars may be only beginning.
The union, under its new president, Shawn Fain, wants workers who make electric vehicle components like batteries to benefit from the better pay and labor standards that the roughly 150,000 U.A.W. members enjoy at the three automakers. Most battery plants are not unionized.
The Detroit automakers counter that these workers are typically employed in joint ventures with foreign manufacturers that the U.S. automakers don't wholly control. The companies say that even if they could raise wages for battery workers to the rate set under their national U.A.W. contract, doing so could make them uncompetitive with nonunion rivals, like Tesla.
And then there is former President Donald J. Trump, who is running to unseat Mr. Biden and has said the president's clean energy policies are costing American jobs and raising prices for consumers.
White House officials say Mr. Biden will still be able to deliver on his promise of high-quality jobs and a strong domestic electric vehicle industry.
"The president's policies have always been geared toward ensuring not only that our electric vehicle future was made in America with American jobs," said Gene Sperling, Mr. Biden's liaison to the U.A.W. and the auto industry, "but that it would promote good union jobs and a just transition" for current autoworkers whose jobs are threatened.
But in public at least, the president has so far spoken only in vague terms about wages. Last month, he said that the transition to electric vehicles should enable workers to "make good wages and benefits to support their families" and that when union jobs were replaced with new jobs, they should go to union members and pay a "commensurate" wage. He is encouraging the companies and the union to keep bargaining and reach an agreement, one of Mr. Biden's economic advisers, Jared Bernstein, told reporters on Wednesday.
A strike could force Mr. Biden to be more explicit and choose between his commitment to workers and the need to broker a compromise that averts a costly long-term shutdown.
"Battery workers need to be paid the same amount as U.A.W. workers at the current Big Three," said Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California who has promoted government investments in new technologies.
Mr. Khanna added, "It's how we contrast with Trump: We're for creating good-paying manufacturing jobs across the Midwest."
At the heart of the debate is whether the shift to electric vehicles, which have fewer parts and generally require less labor to assemble than gas-powered cars, will accelerate the decline of unionized work in the industry.
Foreign and domestic automakers have announced tens of thousands of new U.S.-based electric vehicle and battery jobs in response to the subsidies that Mr. Biden helped enact. But most of those jobs are not unionized, and many are in the South or West, where the U.A.W. has struggled to win over autoworkers. The union has tried and failed to organize workers at Tesla's factory in Fremont, Calif., and Southern plants owned by Volkswagen and Nissan.
As a result, the union has focused its efforts on battery workers employed directly or indirectly by G.M., Ford and Stellantis. The going wage for this work tends to be far below the roughly $ 32 an hour that veteran U.A.W. members make under their existing contracts with three companies.
Legally, employees of the three manufacturers can't strike over the pay of battery workers employed by joint ventures. But many U.A.W. members worry that letting battery manufacturers pay far lower wages will allow G.M., Ford and Stellantis to replace much of their current U.S. work force with cheaper labor, so they are seeking a large wage increase for those workers.
"What we want is for the E.V. jobs to be U.A.W. jobs under our master agreements," said Scott Houldieson, chairperson of Unite All Workers for Democracy, a group within the union that helped propel Mr. Fain to the presidency.
The union's officials have pressed the auto companies to address their concerns about battery workers before its members vote on a new contract. They say the companies can afford to pay more because they collectively earned about $ 250 billion in North America over the past decade, according to union estimates.
But the auto companies, while acknowledging that they have been profitable in recent years, point out that the transition to electric vehicles is very expensive. Industry executives have suggested that it is hard to know how quickly consumers will embrace electric vehicles and that companies needed flexibility to adjust.
Even if labor costs were not an issue, said Corey Cantor, an electric vehicle analyst at the energy research firm BloombergNEF, it could take the Big Three several years to catch up to Tesla, which makes about 60 percent of fully electric vehicles sold in the United States.
Data from BloombergNEF show that G.M., Ford and Stellantis together sold fewer than 100,000 battery electric vehicles in the United States last year; in 2017, Tesla alone sold 50,000. It took Tesla another five years to top half a million U.S. sales. (The Big Three also sold nearly 80,000 plug-in hybrids last year.)
The three established automakers had hoped to use the transition to electric cars to bring their costs more in line with their competitors, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, a research firm. If they can't, he added, they will have to look for savings elsewhere.
In a statement, Stellantis said its battery joint venture "intends to offer very competitive wages and benefits while making the health and safety of its work force a top priority."
Estimates shared by Ford put hourly labor costs, including benefits, for the three automakers in the mid- $ 60s, versus the mid- $ 50s for foreign automakers in the United States and the mid- $ 40s for Tesla.
Ford's chief executive, Jim Farley, said in a statement last month that the company's offer to raise pay in the next contract was "significantly better" than what Tesla and foreign automakers paid U.S. workers. He added that Ford "will not make a deal that endangers our ability to invest, grow and share profits with our employees."
Mr. Biden and Democratic lawmakers had sought to offset this labor-cost disadvantage by providing an additional $ 4,500 subsidy for each electric vehicle assembled at a unionized U.S. plant, above other incentives available to electric cars. But the Senate removed that provision from the Inflation Reduction Act.
Such setbacks have frustrated the U.A.W., an early backer of Mr. Biden's clean energy plans. In May, the union, which normally supports Democratic presidential candidates, withheld its endorsement of Mr. Biden's re-election.
"The E.V. transition is at serious risk of becoming a race to the bottom," Mr. Fain said in an internal memo. "We want to see national leadership have our back on this before we make any commitments."
The next month, Mr. Fain chided the Biden administration for awarding Ford a $ 9.2 billion loan to build three battery factories in Tennessee and Kentucky with no inducement for the jobs to be unionized.
Mr. Biden tapped Mr. Sperling, a Michigan native, to serve as the White House point person on issues related to the union and the auto industry around the same time. By late August, the Energy Department announced that it was making $ 12 billion in grants and loans available for investments in electric vehicles, with a priority on automakers that create or maintain good jobs in areas with a union presence.
Mr. Sperling speaks regularly with both sides in the labor dispute, seeking to defuse misunderstandings before they escalate, and said the recent Energy Department funding reflected Mr. Biden's commitment to jump-start the industry while creating good jobs.
Complicating the picture for Mr. Biden is the growing chorus of Democratic politicians and liberal groups that have backed the autoworkers' demands, even as they hail the president's success in improving pay and labor standards in other green industries, like wind and solar.
Nearly 30 Democratic senators signed a letter to auto executives this summer urging them to bring battery workers into the union's national contract. Dozens of labor and environmental groups have signed a letter echoing the demand.
The groups argue that the change would have only a modest impact on automakers' profits because labor accounts for a relatively small portion of overall costs, a claim that some independent experts back.
Yen Chen, principal economist of the Center for Automotive Research, a nonprofit group in Ann Arbor, Mich., said labor accounted for only about 5 percent of the cost of final assembly for a midsize domestic sedan based on an analysis the group ran 10 years ago. Mr. Chen said that figure was likely to be lower today, and lower still for battery assembly, which is highly automated.
Beyond the economic case, however, Mr. Biden's allies say allowing electric vehicles to drive down auto wages would be a catastrophic political mistake. Workers at the three companies are concentrated in Midwestern states that could decide the next presidential election -- and, as a result, the fate of the transition to clean energy, said Jason Walsh, the executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of unions and environmental groups.
"The economic effects of doing that are enormously harmful," he said. "The political consequences would be disastrous."

Frequency Shifts; Mars Lander Serves Up Surprise: The Red Planet Is Spinning Faster: [Science Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The discovery, using data from NASA's retired InSight lander, is puzzling to scientists who study the red planet.
For reasons unknown, the spin of Mars is speeding up.
NASA's InSight lander fell silent in December after dust accumulated on its solar panels. But scientists continue to sift through the four years' worth of data it gathered, learning more about what is deep inside the red planet.
Most of what they have learned about Mars came from InSight's sensitive seismometer, placed on the surface to measure the minuscule vibrations from small marsquakes and meteor impacts reverberating around and through the planet.
In a paper published in June in the journal Nature, scientists working on the mission reported additional findings gleaned from tiny shifts in the frequencies of radio transmissions between Earth and InSight on Mars.
When InSight's location on Mars was moving toward Earth, a phenomenon known as the Doppler effect compressed the radio waves slightly, shortening the wavelength and increasing the frequency. When InSight was in motion away from the receiving antenna on Earth, the wavelength lengthened and the frequency decreased. That is the same phenomenon that makes a siren of an approaching ambulance sound higher in pitch when it is approaching and lower as it moves away.
Most of the Doppler effect arises from the relative motions of Mars and Earth as they move around the sun. Interplanetary radio transmissions are also distorted by moisture in Earth's atmosphere and the solar wind of charged particles streaming from the sun.
Once the scientists accounted for all of that, there were leftover frequency variations. Mars, because it is not a perfectly round sphere, wobbles like a top. "The primary goal is to measure the rotation," said Sébastien Le Maistre of the Royal Observatory of Belgium, who led the radio science experiment, known as the Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment, or RISE.
If precise enough, the measurements of the rotation with all of the wobbles place constraints on the structure and composition of the very deep parts of the planet, Dr. Le Maistre said.
Similar measurements had been attempted during NASA's Viking missions in the 1970s and also during later missions like Pathfinder in 1997, but those were not precise enough or long enough. "This was never done for any planet other than the Earth before," Dr. Le Maistre said.
From the magnitude of the wobbles, the scientists calculated that the molten core of Mars is about 2,280 miles wide. (Mars as a whole is about 4,200 miles in diameter.)
The size of the core derived from radio wobbles roughly matched what had been observed from seismic waves that passed through the planet. The scientists also saw no sign of a smaller, solid inner core like the one inside Earth. As with the seismic data, the wobbles suggested that the core of Mars is made mostly of molten iron but also has sizable amounts of lighter elements like sulfur, oxygen and carbon.
The higher concentration of light elements in the core "is very difficult to reconcile with the cosmic chemical models that we have of Mars's formation," said Bruce Banerdt, the principal investigator for the InSight mission.
The measurements also showed the expected undulations of the planet's rotation, quickest during winter and summer and slowest during spring and fall, as the distribution of frozen carbon dioxide in the ice caps shifted with the seasons.
When including the Viking mission's Doppler measurements from 47 years ago, the scientists found a slight speeding up in the spin of Mars, which has led to a shortening of a Martian day by about 1.5 millionths of a second per Martian year. (A Martian year is almost twice as long as a year on Earth.)
"It was a surprise," Dr. Banerdt said. "We did not expect to see that at all."
That is the opposite of Earth, where the moon is slowly moving farther away and the length of the day is getting longer, the main reason that leap seconds are occasionally added to timekeeping (although that will change in 2035). The melting of glaciers and shifting atmosphere can also change the spin rate.
But on Mars, the cause of the speedup is a mystery. It is known that one of the Martian moons, Phobos, is gradually falling, and that indeed is speeding up the rotation of Mars -- like a figure skater pulling in the arms to spin faster -- but that is not big enough to explain what was observed.
Dr. Banerdt said the most likely cause was a long-term accumulation of ice at the poles. Dr. Le Maistre said another possibility was the melting of glaciers in the polar regions. The planetary crust, no longer pressed down by the weight of glaciers, would then slowly rebound, and the shape of Mars would stretch vertically, speeding the rotation.
Less likely would be asteroid impacts knocking the planet in a direction to spin faster.
"It's really difficult to torque up a planet and speed it up with torque," Dr. Banerdt said, "but relatively simple to change the moment of inertia and get it to speed up a little."

BMW Plans to Build Electric Minis in Britain: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The move is a boost for Britain's car industry, but uncertainty remains about the sector's future in the country.
BMW said on Monday that it would invest 600 million pounds, or about $ 750 million, to build electric versions of its popular Mini car models in Britain.
The German manufacturer's move allays fears that the combination of Brexit and the shift to electric cars would pose a dire threat to automobile manufacturing in Britain, but questions over the sector's long-term future remain.
BMW's announcement is the third major piece of good news for Britain's beleaguered car industry in recent months. Tata Group, the owner of Jaguar Land Rover, said in July that it would spend £4 billion to build a battery plant in western England.
And last week, Stellantis, the leading maker of commercial vans in Britain, began producing electric-powered vans at its plant near Liverpool, after a £100 million investment.
The British government used the promise of subsidies to clinch BMW's investment, as it did to land Tata's commitment to build the battery plant. BMW said its investment was "supported" by Britain's government, but neither party provided details.
BMW said it would build two electric models at its factory in Oxford: a three-door Mini Cooper sedan and a small sport utility vehicle called the Mini Aceman.
There had been worries that BMW might shift all electric Mini production to China, but the move to continue producing the vehicles in Britain was not necessarily a surprise. With the future of the global car industry clouded by uncertainty over how the shift to electric vehicles will play out, analysts say it was logical to make what is a relatively modest investment by auto standards to keep making the cars in Britain for the next few years.
"To keep that plant running is a fairly sensible option," said Peter Wells, an auto industry specialist at Cardiff University in Wales.
After all, the Mini is a brand closely associated with Britain, where it originated in the middle of the last century. That heritage is likely to help sales. Almost 46,000 Minis sold in Britain in 2022.
BMW has already shifted some production of electric Minis to China. It now says the Oxford plant will move completely to making electric vehicles by 2030.
Shutting down the 110-year-old Oxford factory, where an electric Mini is already being built alongside conventional models, and paying severance costs, would probably have been expensive. It also might have proved unpopular with potential customers.
"Mini has always been aware of its history," Stefanie Wurst, the head of the brand for Mini, said in a statement.
Kemi Badenoch, Britain's business and trade secretary, called BMW's move "a big vote of confidence."
BMW says it employs about 4,000 people at the Oxford factory and at a site that makes components in Swindon, England. Last year, 186,000 Minis were made in Britain, third in overall numbers of cars produced, after Nissan and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW said that it would begin exporting the two new electric Mini models from China in 2024, as part of a joint venture it has with Great Wall Motor. Production of those models would not begin in Britain until 2026.
While the British car industry seems to have a stronger pulse than some analysts expected, recent investments largely represent moves by brands like Jaguar, Land Rover and Mini, which have strong associations with Britain. So far, Britain does not seem to be attracting investment from the likes of Tesla or Chinese vehicle makers.
The number of cars made each year in Britain roughly halved between 2015 and 2022. But for the first seven months of 2023, British car production was up 14 percent over the same period a year earlier.

Toyota's Electric Vehicles Could Use a Boost: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The world's largest carmaker dominates the sales of hybrid cars but has been slow to sell all-electric vehicles, alienating some customers and hurting sales.
Rachel Culin considered herself a Toyota loyalist, one of millions of people who appreciated the company's reliable and fuel-efficient hybrids. But she recently bought an electric Chevrolet Bolt to replace her Toyota Prius because the Japanese automaker had been too slow when it came to selling electric vehicles.
"Where are the options for those people who love Toyota?" Ms. Culin, a resident of Mesa, Ariz., said. "It's really sad."
Once the leading brand for environmentally conscious car owners, Toyota has failed to keep up with changing consumer preferences and a push by governments around the world to greatly reduce the burning of fossil fuels, the main cause of climate change.
The company and the Japanese auto industry are facing the biggest business challenge they have confronted since becoming global giants in the 1980s. How they respond could determine whether they remain at the top of the auto industry or become afterthoughts.
Toyota, the world's largest automaker, is the nucleus of power for the country's large auto industry. It has alliances with smaller automakers like Subaru and Mazda and wields enormous influence over government officials and industry groups. The company is also a major employer in the United States, with nearly 30,000 workers in Kentucky, Indiana, Texas and other states.
Its business decisions can have far-reaching economic and environmental implications. Toyota arguably did more to improve fuel efficiency and cut emissions than any other established automaker by pioneering hybrid cars that augment a gasoline engine with a battery and an electric motor. But having staked so much on hybrids, it has moved slowly to cars that produce no tailpipe emissions.
That has opened room for Tesla and BYD, a Chinese automaker, to challenge Toyota's dominance by offering appealing and affordable battery electric cars. Toyota has lost market share in the United States, and its sales in China have fallen.
Japanese carmakers have been here before. But last time they were the insurgents.
In the 1970s, with fuel prices soaring, Americans began replacing gas-guzzling cars with small, fuel-efficient Japanese models, challenging the dominance of General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler.
Toyota's manufacturing methods became synonymous with manufacturing efficiency, and many factories adopted what became known as the "Toyota way" or "Toyota method."
Today, Toyota is the one learning from rivals. The company is adopting techniques from Tesla. In China, it has teamed up with BYD in the hope of absorbing its electric motor and battery technology.
"The stage of the battle has changed," said Sanshiro Fukao, a senior research fellow at the Itochu Research Institute, and "the Japanese auto industry in particular has been very slow to act."
Toyota may no longer be able to take its time.
During the pandemic, the global automotive market passed a milestone that caught the world's major automakers flat-footed. In 2022, sales of electric vehicles surged nearly 70 percent to 7.7 million, surpassing those of hybrid-electric vehicles for the first time as demand skyrocketed in China, according to IDTechEx, a market research consultancy.
Toyota remains highly profitable, earning $ 8.9 billion in the quarter that ended on June 30. Last year, it sold 10.5 million vehicles, eight times as many as Tesla. But fewer than 1 percent of the cars it sold were fully electric vehicles.
The absence of electric vehicles has been especially costly in China, the world's largest car market. In July, Toyota's sales in China were down over 15 percent from a year earlier.
In the United States, Toyota's sales have increased, but less than other automakers. From June to August, the company's share of the passenger car market slipped to 13.8 percent from 15.1 percent a year earlier, according to the market research firm Cox Automotive.
The story is much the same for other Japanese automakers like Honda, Mazda and Subaru. Even Nissan, which began selling the Leaf electric car in 2010, has fallen behind, failing to produce a car that could rival Tesla's Model 3 in range, performance or design. Nissan accounted for less than 2 percent of the electric car market in the United States in the first half of the year. In China, it expects sales could drop by almost a quarter in the current fiscal year.
In May the International Council on Clean Transportation, a nonprofit organization, rated the 20 largest automakers on their progress toward zero emissions. Five of the six companies with the lowest scores were Japanese: Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mazda and Suzuki.
Foreign automakers in China produced electric models designed to placate regulators rather than appeal to consumers, said Christopher Richter, senior research analyst at CLSA, an investment firm.
"They didn't make them as great as they could, and they were behind the learning curve," he said.
Toyota has tacitly acknowledged that it has fallen far behind Tesla and BYD. The decision in January by the Toyota scion Akio Toyoda to step down as chief executive was widely seen as a recognition that the company needed new leadership to navigate the transformation of the auto industry.
The sense of urgency was compounded by the Shanghai auto show in April, said Tatsuya Otani, a journalist who has spent decades reporting on the Japanese auto industry.
Chinese vehicles at the show featured onboard controls and entertainment options that made them look more like iPhones on wheels than traditional cars. Japanese executives were stunned to see how much progress their Chinese rivals had made, Mr. Otani said.
Toyota declined to make executives available for interviews.
The only all-electric Toyota sold in the United States is the bZ4X, a sport utility vehicle that the company recalled last year because faulty bolts could cause the wheels to fall off -- an embarrassing misstep. In China, the company also offers an electric sedan, the BZ3. (Toyota's Lexus division sells one fully electric model in the United States and two in some countries.)
On returning from Shanghai, Toyota executives ordered employees to rush out a presentation on the company's plans for its electric vehicle production. Toyota shared the plan less than two weeks before the company's annual meeting, where shareholders, angered by the slow progress on battery-powered cars, proposed a resolution pushing the company to disclose its climate change lobbying.
The measure did not pass, but the rare expression of dissent was an indication of how Toyota, once praised as a paragon of clean tech, had fallen out of favor.
"They just are not moving quickly enough to E.V.s at a time when that is where the market and the planet are going," said Brad Lander, the comptroller of New York City, which owns more than $ 100 million in Toyota stock through its pension funds and backed the resolution.
The company has disputed that characterization, arguing that hybrid cars can help reduce carbon dioxide emissions more and faster than battery electric vehicles, which remain too expensive for many buyers.
Factoring in a cleaner manufacturing process for hybrid cars and the limited availability of critical battery materials, such as lithium, hybrids are a safer short-term bet, Toyota executives have said in recent public statements.
In Washington, the company has called for less stringent auto emission limits, saying in July that a proposed new standard "underestimates key challenges including the scarcity of minerals to make batteries, the fact that these minerals are not mined or refined in the U.S., the inadequate infrastructure and the high cost" of electric vehicles.
"When they do math, the effect on the environment is far greater for hybrids," said Jeffrey Liker, a professor emeritus at the University of Michigan and the author of several books on Toyota. "In addition to that, they make a whole lot more money."
Sales of all-electric vehicles are growing faster than hybrids. But some analysts predict that hybrid sales will surge as would-be electric vehicle buyers worry that the public charging network is inadequate and unreliable. If that happens, Toyota's strategy could be vindicated.
Anita Rajan, general director of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association in the United States, said Japanese automakers were biding their time until they could make electric cars that were as reliable and affordable as the gasoline vehicles.
"I don't know if there's a benefit in being first to market with these vehicles," Ms. Rajan said. "I think it's how you're entering the market and the thoughtfulness that you show for your customers."
In Toyota's home market, consumers have shown little appetite for battery electric cars, and the government has been reluctant to aggressively push for change in a profitable industry.
That could be a problem for Japanese carmakers, which have traditionally honed their technology at home before marketing it abroad, said Kazutoshi Tominaga, a managing director at Boston Consulting Group, which has worked with Japan's trade ministry to shape national electric vehicle policy.
"If Japan, as a market, doesn't shift to electrification, we don't have a place to test the product," he said.
Yet BYD has opened 10 dealerships in Japan and plans to have 100 by the end of 2025. The company went so far as to release a video in August calling on Chinese automakers to "demolish the old legends," widely interpreted as a reference to Japanese and Western automakers.
On a recent Sunday, prospective buyers waited patiently to take a BYD S.U.V. for a spin around the Tokyo neighborhood Ikebukuro. Salespeople were quick to point out the car's eligibility for thousands of dollars in subsidies from Japan's trade ministry, which has allocated $ 90 billion to promote battery electric cars.
Two nearby Toyota showrooms were largely empty.
Customers are "satisfied" with the current options, said Masaki Nagasawa, the deputy manager of a Toyota dealership in Tokyo. "For people who are wavering, subsidies are an incentive to buy," but most customers are anxious about electric cars' range and prefer hybrids, he said.
Toyota has said it is working on new production techniques and innovative battery technology that would increase its cars' range and reduce the time it takes to charge them. The company has said that its lineup will include 10 new all-electric vehicles by 2026 and that it will aim to sell 3.5 million of them annually by 2030.
Speaking on Wednesday in Tokyo after the unveiling of a new luxury plug-in hybrid vehicle, Simon Humphries, who is in charge of branding and design and is a director on Toyota's board, said the company was releasing new electric options "month by month, year by year."
But, he added, while there is an "urgency" to introduce new battery-powered cars, "there's urgency in every segment."
Electric vehicle companies are moving fast.
Tesla is on track to sell nearly two million electric cars this year and is building a factory in Mexico, where it is expected to make a car that sells for around $ 25,000. In the United States, the company's Model 3 sedan already sells for about as much as a comparably equipped Toyota Camry after federal and state incentives are taken into account.
BYD is rapidly expanding outside China, including in Europe, Latin America and Southeast Asia. Its extensive electric lineup includes models that are cheaper than Toyota's most affordable sedans and a mammoth luxury S.U.V. that sells for around $ 150,000.
Just as Apple, Google and Samsung quickly displaced Nokia and BlackBerry in the mobile phone business, some analysts say, Tesla and BYD could be so far ahead in making electric cars by 2026 that Toyota might struggle to catch up.
But Japanese officials are more sanguine.
People own cars longer, so the transition will not be as fast as with cellphones, said Naoki Kobayashi, a deputy director of the trade ministry's automobile division.
He acknowledges that Toyota faces a big challenge, but, he added, "unlike with smartphones, we've still got time."

Disruptive Power of Weight Loss Drugs Is Rippling Through Other Industries: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Retailers, the makers of foods marketed for weight loss, and other types of companies could see knock-on effects from the rise of diabetes and weight loss drugs like Ozempic.
As they do every summer, publicly traded companies posted their second-quarter results while Americans were baring their bodies on the beach. But this year, the timing was apt. On several earnings calls in August, chief executives reassured investors that the Ozempic revolution had not left them in the dust, and that they could somehow share in the blazing success of new diabetes and weight loss drugs.
"It puts us in a good position to be a solution for those who are on the drugs," said Dan R. Chard, the chief executive of Medifast, which makes diet products like shakes and protein bars, adding: "They're looking for guidance." He told analysts this even while explaining that new-generation drugs had helped pummel earnings, down 34.7 percent year on year.
"We will continue to study this," Michael Johnson, the chief executive of the nutritional supplement maker Herbalife, told investors. "And when we see an opportunity to capitalize on it, we will."
In theory, that opportunity -- both for making profits and for losing fortunes -- could be vast not only for the companies behind these drugs but also for some in completely different industries.
Known as GLP-1 drugs, the medications are already driving big profits. Novo Nordisk makes both Ozempic, which has been approved only for Type 2 diabetes, and its close relative Wegovy, which has been approved for weight loss. They mimic a glucagon-like peptide that regulates appetite in the brain, leaving people feeling sated for hours. Together, they helped send Novo's earnings rocketing up 32 percent in the first half of this year, and Novo's market value is now larger than the entire Danish economy. Eli Lilly's sales surged 28 percent in the second quarter, thanks to another diabetes drug, Mounjaro, which the Food and Drug Administration may approve for weight loss this year.
And the full potential isn't even clear yet. The market for weight loss drugs is huge: There are roughly 750 million obese people worldwide, including about 42 percent of adults in the United States, where obesity-related illnesses incur billions of dollars in health care costs each year. But Novo says GLP-1 drugs could eventually have other uses, like helping prevent cardiovascular disease among obese adults. There are signs they could treat addiction and even Alzheimer's, too.
"The market potential is very, very significant," Novo's chief financial officer, Karsten Knudsen, told me when I visited the company in June. "We're operating in kind of unusual territory."
Diet companies are bracing for disruption. For decades, weight loss companies have relied on branded, prepackaged meals and lifestyle programs. Some, like WeightWatchers and Noom, have raced to sell GLP-1 drugs themselves, while others still hope their products can survive the Ozempic era. Jenny Craig shut its weight loss centers in May after 40 years. And Simply Good Foods, which distributes Atkins diet products like frozen meals and cookies, will market Atkins as "a perfect complement to people thinking about using the drugs," the company's chief executive at the time, Joe Scalzo, told analysts in June.
The ripple effects are widening. Retailers like Walmart, Kroger and Rite Aid say GLP-1 prescriptions are bringing more people into stores, where they make other purchases. Walmart's chief executive, Doug McMillon, told analysts in August that its executives "expect consumables, and health and wellness, primarily due to the popularity of some GLP-1 drugs, to grow as a percent of total."
Medtronic's chief executive, Geoff Martha, said the company had seen a "modest" dip in bariatric surgery, presumably as people opted for weight loss drugs instead. And some analysts believe the drugs could disrupt the American diet.
"If you're eating fast food every day, you'll probably continue to eat fast food every day," James van Geelen of Citrinas Capital Management said on Bloomberg's "Odd Lots" podcast. "You will just eat a lot less of it."
Still, there is room for other approaches to fighting obesity. "These drugs are game changers, but with an asterisk," said David Ludwig, an obesity specialist and pediatrics professor at Harvard Medical School. (The drugs come with a long list of side effects.) "Even if you can reduce weight across the population with drugs, it's not going to eliminate the risks of a poor diet."
Flush with cash, Novo agrees. "We need to be looking at what's the next thing," its executive vice president for commercial strategy Camilla Sylvest, told me. In June, the company launched an obesity prevention unit near Copenhagen, to research how to stop the disease before people need to take drugs to lose weight. -- Vivienne Walt
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
The U.S. labor market begins to look like its old self. Employers added 187,000 jobs in August, the Labor Department reported Friday, and unemployment rose to 3.8 percent as the economy continued to lose momentum built up after pandemic lockdowns.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo visits China. She had the tricky task of promoting trade between the two superpowers while holding firm on technology export limits imposed in the name of American national security. The two countries agreed to create new dialogues, including a working group for commercial issues.
The White House names the first drugs set for Medicare price negotiations. The long-awaited list of 10 medicines will be subject to a landmark new program meant to reduce costs for Medicare. Drugmakers have pushed back against the plan, including in court, and Republicans have criticized the initiative as government overreach.
UBS reports a $ 29 billion quarterly profit, with an asterisk. The huge gain -- the biggest in banking history -- stems from the bank's acquisition of its rival Credit Suisse this spring for about $ 3.2 billion, a steep discount that is skewing UBS's results. But it belies the challenges that UBS faces as it moves to complete the largest takeover of a bank since the 2008 financial crisis.
The last girl boss
When Emily Weiss stepped down last year as the chief executive of Glossier, the skin care and beauty brand she founded in 2014, some called it the end of the "girlboss." That archetype -- of media-savvy female founders with venture-darling, millennial-focused start-ups -- had been propelled by "#Girlboss," the Nasty Gal founder Sophia Amoruso's 2014 memoir.
Glossier, with its direct-to-consumer model and voice-y website, changed the way women buy makeup, eventually passing a $ 1 billion valuation. But the brand stumbled as it struggled to move into brick-and-mortar retail; faced criticism from retail employees who alleged a toxic, racist working environment; and shelved projects like a makeup line that departed from its dewy, barely-there look.
DealBook spoke to Marisa Meltzer, author of the upcoming book "Glossy: Ambition, Beauty, and the Inside Story of Emily Weiss's Glossier," about what lessons we might glean from Weiss and the #Girlboss movement.
This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
Can you contextualize the #Girlboss movement?
It was pretty offensive and diminutive. No one except for Sophia was calling themselves out as a girlboss. But it was also something that benefited them because it attracted interest. It was a way for them to get press about their businesses that wasn't the typical things that female founders and C.E.O.s sometimes had to do, like a fashion spread.
There was a big debate at the time over whether the press would have covered the scandals at companies like Outdoor Voices, Man Repeller and Glossier differently if they had men at the helm. What do you think?
I think there was a bit of a thirst for blood. These women had been propped up in a way that was kind of annoying -- I'm sure it was annoying to them, too.
Some of those companies had real problems, like being sued over firing pregnant employees. And other companies had, like Glossier, an accusation of having a workplace, largely for their retail employees, that wasn't ideal. That's different than criminal behavior.
The reality is these companies weren't the same. The women at their helms were not all the same. And they weren't making the same mistakes. And they also didn't have the same level of success.
What happens to Glossier now?
Glossier seems to have taken the time since Emily stepped down to re-evaluate. They decided to really belatedly go into retail. They launched in Sephora last February. The larger task that they're trying to do is make the company in better shape for an exit.
Who might buy them?
A company like Estée Lauder that owns a lot of boutique brands would make sense. There's also Kering, the fashion house that owns Gucci, which has been making some visible plays to get more into the beauty market.
On our radar: The story of Carlos Ghosn
In 2019, while facing criminal charges of financial wrongdoing, the former Nissan executive Carlos Ghosn skipped bail and fled Japan in an elaborate plot that involved a private jet and a trunk with breathing holes drilled into it. At the time, DealBook called it "a movie-level caper," and two projects -- one by the BBC and another by Netflix -- were quick to portray it on video. But neither did so as well as a four-part Apple TV+ documentary series that was released last week.
"Wanted: The Escape of Carlos Ghosn" is produced by The Wall Street Journal and is based on a book by two of its reporters. With Ghosn's participation, it tells the thriller-like drama of one of the most memorable business stories this decade while exploring its nuances.
"The series explicitly poses the question of Carlos Ghosn: victim or villain?" The Guardian's Adrian Horton writes. "With blurred lines, overlapping narratives and convoluted paper trails, it doesn't land on a simple answer."

Full text: Enlarge this image.
MEXICO CITY — It is perhaps Mexico’s most notorious cold case — 43 college students shot at by police, forced into patrol cars, handed over to a drug cartel and never seen again.
The mystery has haunted the nation for nearly a decade. How could a relatively unknown gang pull off one of the worst atrocities in Mexico’s recent history, with the help of the police and the military watching the mass abduction unfold in real time?
A vast trove of about 23,000 unpublished text messages, witness testimony and investigative files obtained by The New York Times point to an answer: Just about every arm of government in that part of southern Mexico had been secretly working for the criminal group for months, putting the machinery of the state in the cartel’s hands and flattening any obstacle that got in its way.
The police commanders whose officers snatched many of the students that night in 2014 had been taking direct orders from the drug traffickers, the text messages show. One of the commanders gave guns to cartel members, while another hunted down their rivals on command.
The military, which closely monitored the abduction but never came to the students’ aid, had been showered with cartel bribes, too. In the text messages, which were caught on wiretaps, traffickers and their collaborators griped about the soldiers’ endless greed, calling them “whores” who they had “in the bag.”
One lieutenant even armed gunmen connected to the cartel and, a witness said, helped police try to cover up their role in the crime after the students were kidnapped and killed.
It has long been known that police officers and an assortment of government officials either helped the cartel abduct the students, or watched the crime happen and did nothing to stop it.
But the text messages have been a breakthrough for investigators — offering the clearest picture yet of a possible motive for the collusion between the authorities and the killers.
Fewer than two dozen of the exchanges have ever been made public. What the thousands of others reveal is staggering: Far beyond buying individual favors, the cartel, known as Guerreros Unidos, had effectively turned public officials into full-blown employees.
The government’s subservience is what made the mass killing of 43 college students possible, investigators say. And the loyalty ran deep.
One of the emergency responders who rushed to the scene of the mass abduction that night had an unofficial second job — gathering intelligence for the cartel. For months, the wiretaps capture him sending minute-by-minute updates on law enforcement’s moves to a Guerreros Unidos leader he called “boss.”
A coroner also did the cartel’s bidding, sending photos of corpses and evidence at crime scenes, the messages show.
After killing some of the students, the traffickers incinerated the bodies in a crematory owned by the coroner’s family, investigators say. In unpublished testimony, one cartel member told authorities that the ovens were routinely used “to make people disappear without a trace.”
The text messages may also help answer another open question in the case: Why did Guerreros Unidos execute a group of 43 students who were training to be teachers and had nothing to do with organized crime?
In the months and weeks before the abduction, the wiretaps show, the cartel had grown increasingly paranoid, beset by deadly infighting and scrambling to defend its territory as rivals pushed in.
So, when dozens of young men swept into the city of Iguala on passenger buses — not unlike the ones the cartel used to smuggle drugs into the United States — the traffickers mistook their convoy for an intrusion by enemies and gave the order to attack, prosecutors now say.
Nine years after the students vanished, no one has been convicted of the crime, turning the case into a symbol of a broken system that cannot solve even the most brazen acts of brutality. The previous government was accused of orchestrating a sweeping cover-up to hide the involvement of federal forces in the abduction, especially the all-powerful military.
Now the investigation is at a critical juncture. Under President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, authorities have ordered the arrest of 20 Mexican soldiers in connection with the kidnappings, including more than a dozen in June. The unpublished wiretaps have been crucial to building the case.
The cartel’s conversations were intercepted by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in 2014 while investigating the cartel for trafficking drugs into suburban Chicago. Mexico sought the text messages for years, but U.S. officials handed over the 23,000 only last year, in part because of a lingering distrust of the Mexican government, an investigator said. The DEA declined to comment.
The messages obtained by the Times do not cover the night of the disappearance, and key details of what happened to the students are still unknown.
What’s clear is that the horror started Sept. 26, 2014, when dozens of students from the Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers’ College traveled to Iguala, in the state of Guerrero. They commandeered several buses to go to a march in Mexico City, a tradition authorities had tolerated in the past.
This time, they never made it past the city limits.
Minutes after the students left the bus station, police chased them down, opened fire and hauled them away. Multiple cartel members have testified that the victims were turned over to the criminal group, which killed them and disposed of their bodies.
The army received constant updates about the crime as it happened. Soldiers were on the streets and a local battalion even had an informant embedded with the students, investigations have shown.
Army intelligence officials were also listening. They were spying on a cartel boss and a police commander as they discussed where to take some of the students that night, military documents show.
And days after the attack, the army knew the location of two suspects talking about releasing students who, investigators say, may have still been alive.
How the military knew this is now clearer — it was using a powerful spy tool manufactured in Israel, known as Pegasus, to surveil the gang’s members, an investigator told the Times.
But the military didn’t share the intelligence with officials searching for the students, and there’s no evidence that the armed forces tried to rescue them, according to investigators who have spent years looking into the case.
“They had all this information, but they hid it,” Cristina Bautista Salvador, the mother of one of the missing students, said of the military. “Instead of looking for our children or telling us the truth, they protected themselves.”
Mexico’s secretary of defense did not respond to a request for comment. Mexico’s president has argued that the accusations against a handful of soldiers are not a sign of broader corruption within the ranks.
“You cannot stain an entire institution because of the actions of one official,” López Obrador said in July.
Investigators trying to uncover the full extent of the military’s involvement have been stymied for years.
The government’s top human rights official was spied on while investigating the armed forces’ role in the mass disappearance. A prosecutor who led the case against the soldiers fled the country in fear late last year.
Then in July, a separate group of international investigators said they were giving up on their own yearslong probe into the crime, citing “obstruction of justice” by Mexico’s military.
But investigators say that no amount of obstruction can hide the collusion laid bare in the wiretaps.
The evidence “is very robust, strong, unquestionable,” said Omar Gómez Trejo, a Mexican prosecutor who went up against the military and then fled to the United States after the backlash made him fear for his safety. “It corroborates how the cartel operates and the connections it had to the authorities, including the army.”
‘All They Want to Do Is Take’
Reading the cartel’s text messages for the first time last year, in a conference room in the DEA’s headquarters in Chicago, Gómez Trejo realized he had been handed a gold mine.
It had taken years for Mexican officials to get their hands on some of the wiretaps, unleashing criticism in Mexico that U.S. officials had withheld crucial information. Now the DEA had finally given him and his team access to a broad set of intercepts covering months of cartel communications.
“We kept looking at each other” in amazement, Gómez Trejo said of the wiretaps. “You marvel at the fact that you’re seeing a revelation.”
By that time, the Biden administration had listed Guerreros Unidos among the criminal organizations “that pose the greatest drug threat to the United States,” and much had been written about the cartel’s efforts to corrupt elected officials.
But here were the traffickers and officials admitting to it themselves, in private conversations when they thought no one else was listening.
“Do you want me to get your whore of a city councilor in line,” one cartel member asked a local mayor on his payroll, “or should we put him down?”
The mayor responded one second later: “I’ll bring him to you. He’s a good worker.”
The state of Guerrero, where the cartel operated, is one of the poorest states in Mexico, but its mountainous terrain is fertile ground for opium poppy plants filled with the raw material for heroin. So, while the gang spread terror, it was also a rare source of extra cash.
The drug lords often spoke of buying off officials in cryptic language, using nicknames for collaborators and codes for everything from cocaine and kickbacks to large caliber rifles.
So Gómez Trejo’s team pored over every word of each exchange, using reams of investigative files to develop a type of Rosetta stone to decipher the cartel’s penetration of the state.
The traffickers talked about bringing “crabs” or “crab soup” to the military — a reference to money, a cartel member told investigators, because when you hold up your hands like crab pincers, it looks like you’re clutching an imaginary stack of cash.
At times, the traffickers reveled in their influence over such a powerful institution.
“What, you don’t think blondie has the soldiers in the bag?” one cartel member wrote, referring to a fellow gang member, investigators say.
In other moments, they seemed resentful of the soldiers’ demands. “They asked my brother to do the lieutenant a favor,” griped a trafficker.
“All they want to do is take and take,” responded a police commander who helped manage the cartel’s relationship with soldiers.
The hassle seemed to pay off. Cartel members talked about relying on the armed forces to help keep their rivals out of their territory, and using their connections to the military to get out of trouble with uncooperative authorities.
In one message, the police commander says he went with a military officer and a cartel boss to arm gunmen in a nearby town.
When asked whether he knew about the military officer getting a “little gift” from the cartel, the police commander replied: “He’s happy.”
Wiretaps Reveal Associates
The students had no way of knowing just how deeply the cartel had burrowed into every corner of life in its stronghold in Guerrero, investigators say.
“Entering Iguala was like going into the mouth of the wolf,” said Carlos Beristain, one of the international experts who investigated the case.
One cartel member was a butcher. A local blacksmith built hidden compartments for stashing heroin and cocaine inside buses destined for the United States. A group of particularly violent brothers in the gang manned a car wash.
The emergency responder said he was introduced to the group because an acquaintance from high school was dating a cartel member, according to his sworn statement.
He said that when he tried to stop working for the group, he was kidnapped on the orders of a cartel assassin, tied up and beaten until he relented.
“From that day on, I acted as an involuntary informant,” he said, serving as a point person for the gang’s network of street-level lookouts.
The wiretaps show the extent of his responsibilities. He sent cartel leaders barrages of messages tracking law enforcement’s every move, including when they simply stopped “to buy agua frescas.”
The wiretaps also reveal another collaborator: a city coroner. In the text messages, he says his colleague’s brother was a hit man. The coroner used the connection to warn the cartel when assassins were targeting its members.
He discussed receiving cars from the group and declared his loyalty to its Chicago leader, Pablo Vega Cuevas — who has since pleaded guilty to drug charges in the United States — calling him “my boss.”
“I’ll never turn my back on you,” he told the leader. “You guys are like my family.”
Less cooperative officials got death threats.
“Can the mayor exchange dollars for us?” the Chicago boss asked a fellow cartel member in Guerrero.
“Yeah cousin, you know if he doesn’t want to I’ll threaten the asshole,” came the response.
Guerreros Unidos paid some police officers monthly, witnesses said, a kind of retainer that allowed the cartel to call on authorities whenever it wanted.
“You tell yourself, ‘I know I’m committing a crime,’” a police officer said, according to a previously unpublished transcript of his interrogation by law enforcement. But it was impossible to resist regular $50 payments, he said.
“You say, ‘I’m not going to take it, so I don’t get myself into trouble,’ but then you say, ‘No, wait,’” he said.
When cartel members needed to pass through a checkpoint, move weapons or ambush their rivals, they turned to the police.
“Don’t worry, cousin,” a police commander told a cartel member in one message, “you know that we are 1,000% with you here.”
A few months before the students’ abduction, the cartel sent up a flare that showed just how anxious it was about possible rivals setting foot on its territory.
On a Sunday afternoon, traffickers warned that members of an enemy group had stopped by the local market for lunch. Within minutes, the cartel figured out what car they were driving, what they looked like and which food vendor they were near.
“Locate a red Nissan truck, double cab, there will be two men and a woman,” a trafficker texted a police commander in Iguala.
“The units have been alerted, and there’s one unit at the toll both,” the commander texted back.
“When the group decided that something needed to happen, it happened,” said Beristain. “The group had control over the different authorities and could tell them what they had to do.”
‘This Is Going to Get Uglier’
On Friday night, Sept. 26, the cartel spotted something out of the ordinary and sent out a warning, according to Mexican prosecutors.
Members of an enemy group were barreling through Iguala, interspersed with students on stolen buses, a cartel boss told the group’s leaders.
Only it wasn’t true. There were no rival traffickers aboard, investigators say, and other than the sticks and rocks they carried to seize the buses, the students were unarmed.
But the cartel had been on edge for months.
One of its top bosses had recently drowned, another had been arrested and the brothers who were left in charge had lost trust within the ranks, the wiretaps show. The traffickers fretted about a member who had defected to a rival cartel and a murder that appeared to be an inside job.
“My cousin was killed and it was our own people,” the Chicago leader told an associate.
“We cannot trust anyone, absolutely anyone,” the wife of the drowned cartel leader said in another exchange.
The group’s enemies appeared to take note of its vulnerability. In the weeks before the students disappeared, local media reported that the cartel’s rivals had “regrouped” — and were coming for Guerreros Unidos.
The wiretaps lit up with the traffickers fuming about gunbattles around Iguala.
“This is going to get uglier,” the Chicago leader said in late August.
A month later, when Guerreros Unidos got the message about its supposed rivals plowing through on buses, its network of collaborators flew into action.
The two police commanders who had exchanged regular text messages with the cartel led the first attacks on the students that night.
As the students tried to leave Iguala aboard several buses, police officers under the commanders’ control blocked the streets and shot at them, striking some, including one who remains in a coma. The students were then loaded into patrol cars, vanishing soon after.
Several miles away, more police officers stopped another bus of students, used tear gas to get them off, then snatched them away.
They, too, were among the 43 who disappeared.
The emergency responder on the cartel’s payroll said he got two phone calls that night. One of the police commanders asked him “who he should hand over the ‘packages’” to, referring to the hostages. A cartel assassin also called, asking who was bringing him “the packages,” according to his sworn statement.
Exactly what happened next remains a mystery.
According to one cartel member whose testimony has become key to the case, some of the students were taken to a house, killed and dismembered. Machete hacks left gashes in the floor, the witness said, and the students’ remains were later burned in the crematory owned by the coroner’s family.
The military knew where at least some of students were being taken, because it was spying on a conversation between a police commander and a cartel boss as they talked about where to deposit the hostages, according to documents made public by the Mexican government.
Other military intelligence documents, which have not been published, show that the military knew the location of a cartel member involved in the kidnapping days after the attack.
Many of Guerreros Unidos’ leaders in Iguala were arrested after the attack. But no one has been convicted in the disappearance. Charges against dozens of suspects have been dismissed because a judge determined that torture was used to obtain confessions.
The group managed to stay alive, thanks in part to some of the drug lords’ wives and one of their mothers, who took over much of the day-to-day business, according to a separate set of hundreds of unpublished exchanges caught on wiretaps.
Years after the mass disappearance, the Mexican government continued spying on several people in the group, listening to their phone conversations in 2017.
The ties between the cartel and the authorities were still strong.
One of the traffickers involved in the kidnapping talked about how he had just “gotten drunk with the soldiers” at a local restaurant, the wiretaps show. A money manager for the cartel said he had made friends with a federal police commander. A city councilman talked about moving drugs to the United States.
One night, the wife of a jailed boss lost track of a shipment of drugs on its way to the United States. Thinking the smuggler might have made off with the stash, she asked an associate to give him a warning.
“Doesn’t the driver know what happened to the 43,” she said, referring to the abducted students. “I’m sure he doesn’t want to be number 44.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It is perhaps Mexico's most notorious cold case -- 43 college students shot at by the police, forced into patrol cars, handed over to a drug cartel and never seen again.
The mystery has haunted the nation for nearly a decade. How could a relatively unknown gang pull off one of the worst atrocities in Mexico's recent history, with the help of the police and the military watching the mass abduction unfold in real time?
A vast trove of about 23,000 unpublished text messages, witness testimony and investigative files obtained by The New York Times point to an answer: Just about every arm of government in that part of southern Mexico had been secretly working for the criminal group for months, putting the machinery of the state in the cartel's hands and flattening any obstacle that got in its way.
The police commanders whose officers snatched many of the students that night in 2014 had been taking direct orders from the drug traffickers, the text messages show. One of the commanders gave guns to cartel members, while another hunted down their rivals on command.
The military, which closely monitored the abduction but never came to the students' aid, had been showered with cartel bribes, too. In the text messages, which were caught on wiretaps, traffickers and their collaborators griped about the soldiers' endless greed, calling them "whores" whom they had "in the bag."
One lieutenant even armed gunmen connected to the cartel and, a witness said, helped the police try to cover up their role in the crime after the students were kidnapped and killed.
It has long been known that police officers and an assortment of government officials either helped the cartel abduct the students, or watched the crime happen and did nothing to stop it.
But the text messages have been a breakthrough for investigators -- offering the clearest picture yet of a possible motive for the collusion between the authorities and the killers.
Fewer than two dozen of the exchanges have ever been made public. What the thousands of others reveal is staggering: Far beyond buying individual favors, the cartel, known as Guerreros Unidos, had effectively turned public officials into full-blown employees.
The government's subservience is what made the mass killing of 43 college students possible, investigators say. And the loyalty ran deep.
One of the emergency responders who rushed to the scene of the mass abduction that night had an unofficial second job -- gathering intelligence for the cartel. For months, the wiretaps capture him sending minute-by-minute updates on law enforcement's every move to a Guerreros Unidos leader he called "boss."
A coroner also did the cartel's bidding, sending photos of corpses and evidence at crime scenes, the messages show.
After killing some of the students, the traffickers incinerated the bodies in a crematory owned by the coroner's family, investigators say. In unpublished testimony, one cartel member told the authorities that the ovens were routinely used "to make people disappear without a trace."
The text messages may also help answer another open question in the case: Why did Guerreros Unidos execute a group of 43 students who were training to be teachers and had nothing to do with organized crime?
In the months and weeks before the abduction, the wiretaps show, the cartel had grown increasingly paranoid, beset by deadly infighting and scrambling to defend its territory as rivals pushed in.
So, when dozens of young men swept into the city of Iguala on passenger buses -- not unlike the ones the cartel used to smuggle drugs into the United States -- the traffickers mistook their convoy for an intrusion by enemies and gave the order to attack, prosecutors now say.
Nine years after the students vanished, no one has been convicted of the crime, turning the case into a symbol of a broken system that cannot solve even the most brazen acts of brutality. The previous government was accused of orchestrating a sweeping cover-up to hide the involvement of federal forces in the abduction, especially the all-powerful military.
Now the investigation is at a critical juncture. Under President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the authorities have ordered the arrest of 20 Mexican soldiers in connection with the kidnappings, including more than a dozen in June. The unpublished wiretaps have been crucial to building the case.
The cartel's conversations were intercepted by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in 2014 while investigating the cartel for trafficking drugs into suburban Chicago. Mexico sought the text messages for years, but American officials handed over the 23,000 only last year, in part because of a lingering distrust of the Mexican government, an investigator said. The D.E.A. declined to comment.
The messages obtained by The Times do not cover the night of the disappearance, and key details of what happened to the students are still unknown.
What's clear is that the horror started on Sept. 26, 2014, when dozens of students from the Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers' College traveled to Iguala, in the state of Guerrero. They commandeered several buses to go to a march in Mexico City, a tradition the authorities had tolerated in the past.
This time, they never made it past the city limits.
Minutes after the students left the bus station, the police chased them down, opened fire and hauled them away. Multiple cartel members have testified that the victims were turned over to the criminal group, which killed them and disposed of their bodies.
The army received constant updates about the crime as it happened. Soldiers were on the streets and a local battalion even had an informant embedded with the students, investigations have shown.
Army intelligence officials were also listening. They were spying on a cartel boss and a police commander as they discussed where to take some of the students that night, military documents show.
And days after the attack, the army knew the location of two suspects talking about releasing students who, investigators say, may have still been alive.
How the military knew this is now clearer -- it was using a powerful spy tool manufactured in Israel, known as Pegasus, to surveil the gang's members, an investigator told The Times.
But the military didn't share the intelligence with officials searching for the students, and there's no evidence that the armed forces tried to rescue them, according to investigators who have spent years looking into the case.
"They had all this information, but they hid it," Cristina Bautista Salvador, the mother of one of the missing students, said of the military. "Instead of looking for our children or telling us the truth, they protected themselves."
Mexico's secretary of defense did not respond to a request for comment. Mexico's president has argued that the accusations against a handful of soldiers are not a sign of broader corruption within the ranks.
"You cannot stain an entire institution because of the actions of one official," Mr. López Obrador said in July.
Investigators trying to uncover the full extent of the military's involvement have been stymied for years.
The government's top human rights official was spied on while investigating the armed forces' role in the mass disappearance. A prosecutor who led the case against the soldiers fled the country in fear late last year.
Then in July, a separate group of international investigators said they were giving up on their own yearslong probe into the crime, citing "obstruction of justice" by Mexico's military.
But investigators say that no amount of obstruction can hide the collusion laid bare in the wiretaps.
The evidence "is very robust, strong, unquestionable," said Omar Gómez Trejo, the Mexican prosecutor who went up against the military and then fled to the United States after the backlash made him fear for his safety. "It corroborates how the cartel operates and the connections it had to the authorities, including the army."
'All they want to do is take and take'
Reading the cartel's text messages for the first time last year, in a conference room in the Drug Enforcement Administration's headquarters in Chicago, Mr. Gómez Trejo realized he had been handed a gold mine.
It had taken years for Mexican officials to get their hands on some of the wiretaps, unleashing criticism in Mexico that American officials had withheld crucial information. Now the D.E.A. had finally given him and his team access to a broad set of intercepts covering months of cartel communications.
"We kept looking at each other" in amazement, Mr. Gómez Trejo said of the wiretaps. "You marvel at the fact that you're seeing a revelation."
By that time, the Biden administration had listed Guerreros Unidos among the criminal organizations "that pose the greatest drug threat to the United States," and much had been written about the cartel's efforts to corrupt elected officials.
But here were the traffickers and officials admitting to it themselves, in private conversations when they thought no one else was listening.
"Do you want me to get your whore of a city councilor in line," one cartel member asked a local mayor on his payroll, "or should we put him down?"
The mayor responded one second later: "I'll bring him to you. He's a good worker."
The state of Guerrero, where the cartel operated, is one of the poorest states in Mexico, but its mountainous terrain is fertile ground for opium poppy plants filled with the raw material for heroin. So, while the gang spread terror, it was also a rare source of extra cash.
The drug lords often spoke of buying off officials in cryptic language, using nicknames for collaborators and codes for everything from cocaine and kickbacks to large caliber rifles.
So Mr. Gómez Trejo's team pored over every word of each exchange, using reams of investigative files to develop a type of Rosetta stone to decipher the cartel's penetration of the state.
The traffickers talked about bringing "crabs" or "crab soup" to the military -- a reference to money, a cartel member told investigators, because when you hold up your hands like crab pincers, it looks like you're clutching an imaginary stack of cash.
At times, the traffickers reveled in their influence over such a powerful institution.
"What, you don't think blondie has the soldiers in the bag?" one cartel member wrote, referring to a fellow gang member, investigators say.
In other moments, they seemed resentful of the soldiers' demands. "They asked my brother to do the lieutenant a favor," griped a trafficker.
"All they want to do is take and take," responded a police commander who helped manage the cartel's relationship with soldiers.
The hassle seemed to pay off. Cartel members talked about relying on the armed forces to help keep their rivals out of their territory, and using their connections to the military to get out of trouble with uncooperative authorities.
In one message, the police commander says he went with a military officer and a cartel boss to arm gunmen in a nearby town.
When asked whether he knew about the military officer getting a "little gift" from the cartel, the police commander replied: "He's happy."
'We are 1,000 percent with you'
The students had no way of knowing just how deeply the cartel had burrowed into every corner of life in its stronghold in Guerrero, investigators say.
"Entering Iguala was like going into the mouth of the wolf," said Carlos Beristain, one of the international experts who investigated the case.
One cartel member was a butcher. A local blacksmith built hidden compartments for stashing heroin and cocaine inside buses destined for the United States. A group of particularly violent brothers in the gang manned a carwash.
The emergency responder said he was introduced to the group because an acquaintance from high school was dating a cartel member, according to his sworn statement.
He said that when he tried to stop working for the group, he was kidnapped on the orders of a cartel assassin, tied up and beaten until he relented.
"From that day on, I acted as an involuntary informant," he said, serving as a point person for the gang's network of street-level lookouts.
The wiretaps show the extent of his responsibilities. He sent cartel leaders barrages of messages tracking law enforcement's every move, including when they simply stopped "to buy agua frescas."
The wiretaps also reveal another collaborator: a city coroner. In the text messages, he says his colleague's brother was a hit man. The coroner used the connection to warn the cartel when assassins were targeting its members.
He discussed receiving cars from the group and declared his loyalty to its Chicago leader, Pablo Vega Cuevas -- who has since pleaded guilty to drug charges in the United States -- calling him "my boss."
"I'll never turn my back on you," he told the leader. "You guys are like my family."
Less cooperative officials got death threats.
"Can the mayor exchange dollars for us?" the Chicago boss asked a fellow cartel member in Guerrero.
"Yeah cousin, you know if he doesn't want to I'll threaten the asshole," came the response.
Guerreros Unidos paid some police officers monthly, witnesses said, a kind of retainer that allowed the cartel to call on the authorities whenever it wanted.
"You tell yourself, 'I know I'm committing a crime,"' a police officer said, according to a previously unpublished transcript of his interrogation by law enforcement. But it was impossible to resist regular $ 50 payments, he said.
"You say, 'I'm not going to take it, so I don't get myself into trouble,' but then you say, 'No, wait,"' he said.
When cartel members needed to pass through a checkpoint, move weapons or ambush their rivals, they turned to the police.
"Don't worry, cousin," a police commander told a cartel member in one message, "you know that we are 1,000 percent with you here."
A few months before the students' abduction, the cartel sent up a flare that showed just how anxious it was about possible rivals setting foot on its territory.
On a Sunday afternoon, traffickers warned that members of an enemy group had stopped by the local market for lunch. Within minutes, the cartel figured out what car they were driving, what they looked like and which food vendor they were near.
"Locate a red Nissan truck, double cab, there will be two men and a woman," a trafficker texted a police commander in Iguala.
"The units have been alerted, and there's one unit at the toll both," the commander texted back.
"When the group decided that something needed to happen, it happened," said Mr. Beristain. "The group had control over the different authorities and could tell them what they had to do."
'He doesn't want to be number 44'
On Friday night, Sept. 26, the cartel spotted something out of the ordinary and sent out a warning, according to Mexican prosecutors.
Members of an enemy group were barreling through Iguala, interspersed with students on stolen buses, a cartel boss told the group's leaders.
Only it wasn't true. There were no rival traffickers aboard, investigators say, and other than the sticks and rocks they carried to seize the buses, the students were unarmed.
But the cartel had been on edge for months.
One of its top bosses had recently drowned, another had been arrested and the brothers who were left in charge had lost trust within the ranks, the wiretaps show. The traffickers fretted about a member who had defected to a rival cartel and a murder that appeared to be an inside job.
"My cousin was killed and it was our own people," the Chicago leader told an associate.
"We cannot trust anyone, absolutely anyone," the wife of the drowned cartel leader said in another exchange.
The group's enemies appeared to take note of its vulnerability. In the weeks before the students disappeared, local media reported that the cartel's rivals had "regrouped" -- and were coming for Guerreros Unidos.
The wiretaps lit up with the traffickers fuming about gun battles around Iguala.
"This is going to get uglier," the Chicago leader said in late August.
A month later, when Guerreros Unidos got the message about its supposed rivals plowing through on buses, its network of collaborators flew into action.
The two police commanders who had exchanged regular text messages with the cartel led the first attacks on the students that night.
As the students tried to leave Iguala aboard several buses, police officers under the commanders' control blocked the streets and shot at them, striking some, including one who remains in a coma. The students were then loaded into patrol cars, vanishing soon after.
Several miles away, more police officers stopped another bus of students, used tear gas to get them off, then snatched them away.
They, too, were among the 43 who disappeared.
The emergency responder on the cartel's payroll said he got two phone calls that night. One of the police commanders asked him "who he should hand over the 'packages"' to, referring to the hostages. A cartel assassin also called, asking who was bringing him "the packages," according to his sworn statement.
Exactly what happened next remains a mystery.
According to one cartel member whose testimony has become key to the case, some of the students were taken to a house, killed and dismembered. Machete hacks left gashes in the floor, the witness said, and the students' remains were later burned in the crematory owned by the coroner's family.
The military knew where at least some of students were being taken, because it was spying on a conversation between a police commander and a cartel boss as they talked about where to deposit the hostages, according to documents made public by the Mexican government.
Other military intelligence documents, which have not been published, show that the military knew the location of a cartel member involved in the kidnapping days after the attack.
Many of Guerreros Unidos's leaders in Iguala were arrested after the attack. But no one has been convicted in the disappearance. Charges against dozens of suspects have been dismissed because a judge determined that torture was used to obtain confessions.
The group managed to stay alive, thanks in part to some of the drug lords' wives and one of their mothers, who took over much of the day-to-day business, according to a separate set of hundreds of unpublished exchanges caught on wiretaps.
Years after the mass disappearance, the Mexican government continued spying on several people in the group, listening to their phone conversations in 2017.
The ties between the cartel and the authorities were still strong.
One of the traffickers involved in the kidnapping talked about how he had just "gotten drunk with the soldiers" at a local restaurant, the wiretaps show. A money manager for the cartel said he had made friends with a federal police commander. A city councilman talked about moving drugs to the United States.
One night, the wife of a jailed boss lost track of a shipment of drugs on its way to the United States. Thinking the smuggler might have made off with the stash, she asked an associate to give him a warning.

Full text: Todd Barry, Tracy Morgan, Sasheer Zamata, Chris Fleming and Jared Freid riff on weird characters, middle age, lost histories and more.
Todd Barry, 'Domestic Shorthair'
Stream it on YouTube
Todd Barry speaks fluent sarcasm. After decades of refinement, honing his low-key deadpan into something flexible and distinctive, he can turn a sentence inside-out with the mildest shift in intonation, instantly divorcing what he says from what he means. The pivots in his jokes are subtle but crisp. Ever since David Letterman retired from late night, sarcasm has no better champion. Barry starts waving its flag as soon as the applause settles down on his very funny new special. "That is the type of forced fraudulent crowd response that will propel this whole show," he says, enough of a hint of a smile to soften the blow.
Barry is a taut joke teller more than a yarn-spinner. But his punchlines emerge from anecdotes filled with details about curious characters he's met, tales that have the quirkiness and surprise of what you find in a sensitively observed short story. There's the Uber drive who apologizes for not talking during the ride, the waiter who warns against the Italian dressing in a whisper and the cabinet salesman who says he loves his job because it allows him to eat with his customers. He filters the slightest interactions with them through his arch responses, mocking but not mean. His real adversaries are not people but hyperbole, nonsense or any pointless excess of emotion. And some of his most unexpected laughs are in his own mixing up of mountains and molehills. "My printer broke recently," he said, gently shifting gears to a parody of concern. "Sorry to bum you out."
Tracy Morgan, 'Takin' It Too Far'
Stream it on Max
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
It's been a rough couple of years for Tracy Morgan, the veteran comic, "30 Rock" scene stealer and all-time great talk-show guest. He almost died after being hit by a Walmart truck, then during the pandemic, his marriage fell apart. In his baggy new special, he says his wife "took that social distancing too far."
If you were looking for a bracing and introspective hour on his troubles, you came to the wrong place. Morgan just brings up his problems to crack wise about them. There is little attempt at timeliness (the expiration date on jokes about the slap at the Oscars has passed) or ambitious set pieces with tight jokes snapping into place. This is a comic coasting on charisma, which he can do as well as anyone. His main subject is middle age. He's out to prove you don't need to be mature in your 50s. Instead, he doubles down on sex and fart jokes, yanking his shirt up, rubbing his belly, finishing with a dozen or so minutes on what it's like to sleep with older women. Ultimately, there's no escaping the fact that aging changes you. Morgan confesses he pushed a lap dance away at a strip club, shouting: 'You know my sciatica flared up!"
Sasheer Zamata, 'The First Woman'
Stream it on YouTube
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Why does everyone know Amelia Earhart but not Jerrie Mock, the first woman to fly solo around the world? According to the comic Sasheer Zamata, whose second stand-up special is full of hidden histories, it boils down to marketing. Mock kept to herself, saying, "The kind of person who enjoys being alone in a plane is not the kind who enjoys being continuously around other people." Zamata says she doesn't "like going places or doing things," so perhaps she can relate. Earhart married her publicist, and Zamata calls her the "original Kim Kardashian."
Her digression, filled with punchlines, is just one example of how this special unpacks lost or taboo stories. The political centerpiece of the set is about how we should talk more about female sexuality, especially for girls. She relates a story about masturbating for the first time with a lint roller, then opens the topic to the audience, resulting in some colorful crowd work. Zamata, a former "Saturday Night Live" cast member, turns jokes into carefully crafted vignettes, often hinging on a twist that leads her to widen her eyes for a long pause. She's a poised performer, effortlessly moving from crowd work to dating tales to political gibes. Her description of being hit by a car becomes a peg for how people (including doctors) ignore Black women when describing pain but pay attention to them on the question of what is cool. Her solution? Black women should champion illness ("Sickle cell is sick as hell!"), and disease will be "gentrified out of our bodies."
Chris Fleming, 'Hell'
Stream it on Peacock
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Whenever a new Chris Fleming video appears on my feed, I stop and pay attention. In a scroll of sameness, he's thrillingly unexpected, a shaggy-haired Los Angeles absurdist who often begins with an offhand and narrow idea (sitting in his car, considering the appeal of Adam Driver, say), then riffs on it with a gusto and flamboyance that accumulates its own comic momentum. His is a pointedly niche sensibility but responsible for some of the biggest laughs I have had on social media. His debut, a scattershot affair that mixes a performance at a theater with sketches, has some very funny oddball ideas, like his celebration of the Nissan Cube as the "one true asexual icon in American culture."
His precise dissection of basic families who think they're really eccentric is a characteristic hobby horse. But these bursts of lunacy don't build on one another. In the translation to long form, the pacing gets a little slack. Part of the problem might be editing (you must kill your darlings, especially when they involve sketches that go on too long) and an undercooked overall conceit. Fleming can't seem to entirely decide if his aesthetic is going to be polished or ragged, his material revealing or purely absurd. He's smart enough to commit to the personal and the weird, but absurdity requires its own rigor.
Jared Freid, '37 & Single'
Stream it on Netflix
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In the crowded field of dating jokes, Jared Freid, an amusingly hyperventilating self-deprecator exploring red flags, online profiles and tensions between millennials and Generation Z, distinguishes himself in a couple of ways. In his very strong act-outs, he does an inspired impression of fake laughing that projects real discomfort. It gooses a familiar bit about married people talking to singles about the perils of matrimony into something spiky and layered. Secondarily, not since Leslie Jones has a comic done more with bulging eyes. While dead eyes can kill an act, expressive ones can illuminate it.

A Toddler's Long, Slow Road To Recovery After a Shooting: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It was story time. A pair of 2-year-olds sat on miniature chairs pulled up to a miniature table at Blythedale Children's Hospital in Valhalla, N.Y., listening attentively.
"We have so many animals that have boo-boos in our book," a brown-haired woman said in a singsong voice, holding up a book called "All Better!"
"Feel better, doggy," one of the toddlers, a girl with seven braids, said as she placed a red Band-Aid sticker on the paw of a dog in the book.
The girl, Catherine Arias, was herself recovering from a very real and much more grievous injury. In January 2022, days away from her first birthday, she was caught in the crossfire of a shooting outside a pharmacy in the Bronx. The bullet penetrated the left side of her brain, leaving her with a traumatic injury and weakness on the right side of her body. More than a year and a half later, she still requires five days of therapy every week to improve her ability to eat, talk and move.
Earlier this month, federal prosecutors announced the arrest of two men in connection with Catherine's shooting, a relief to her parents, who have struggled for months to come to terms with the calamity.
"I just started crying -- I couldn't talk after that," Gregory Arias, Catherine's father, said.
"It was like a dry-heave cry," Miraida Gomez, her mother, said. "The cry that I didn't get to have processing everything that we've been through was the cry that I had that morning."
The shooting and its aftermath -- expensive medical treatment for Catherine, worry over the emotional health of her two older sisters, court appearances for the accused men -- have left the family with complicated and conflicting emotions.
Ms. Gomez and Mr. Arias, high school sweethearts, have deep ties to the Bronx, where they were born and raised. They were keenly aware of the violence that can plague their neighborhood.
Catherine was one of 56 children shot in the Bronx last year, the highest tally of any part of the city, according to New York Police Department data. Her injury and her long road to recovery are a grim reminder of the life-altering consequences of gun violence across the city, even when shootings are not fatal.
Yet Ms. Gomez, a social worker, found herself struggling with something approaching sympathy for the men arrested, wondering what was missing in their childhoods that had led them to the streets.
Still, Catherine's parents are eager to provide a far better life for their own children and are now saving money to move out of the Bronx -- out of the city altogether.
'I'm seeing death'
On Jan. 19, 2022, Ms. Gomez had finished work and was excitedly planning Catherine's first birthday party at her mother's house. She had decided on the theme -- pink and purple dinosaurs -- and was finishing the guest list and menu.
Her husband arrived to pick her and the baby up after his shift as a delivery driver for an industrial gas company, and they made a quick stop for a prescription at the Leroy Pharmacy on East 198th Street.
"Lock the doors just in case they try to steal me and Catherine," Ms. Gomez, 34, recalled telling him from the back of the car, where the baby was dozing.
Mr. Arias, 35, went straight to the rear of the pharmacy to retrieve the medication. The store was loud and packed with people wearing masks to protect themselves from Covid-19. He waited in line.
Outside, men were lurking with guns, trying to protect the turf where they were selling cocaine, according to federal prosecutors.
There were one, two, three shots, and then the sound of something hitting the window of the family's Nissan.
Ms. Gomez had learned from a young age to "stop and drop," not just for fires but for shootings, too. She went to grab Catherine from her car seat so that they could both hide behind the driver's seat, but found her baby's body "full of blood."
Ms. Gomez unlocked the car and screamed for help. Catherine's lips turned blue, and Ms. Gomez laid her on the hood of the car and started to give her CPR. A woman gave her a towel and told her to apply pressure to the wound, but Ms. Gomez couldn't find it. There was blood everywhere, soaking Catherine's pink jacket.
The bullet had traveled through the back window, the leather seat and Catherine's car seat, before striking the area between her jaw and skull and traveling up through the left side of her head.
When Mr. Arias returned, he found his wife holding the baby, repeating, "'It's OK, baby. It's OK. It's OK." She told him to call 911.
Mr. Arias froze, his fingers hovering over his cellphone but unable to dial.
"I'm seeing her, but I'm not seeing her," Mr. Arias recalled. "I'm seeing death, I see her passing because she's not responding."
'One too many'
Catherine underwent seven hours of brain surgery. She suffered a seizure and a stroke during the procedure, which led to hemiparesis, or weakness on the right side of her body.
She spent her first birthday in the hospital: Ms. Gomez placed her party outfit over her body on the hospital bed.
That May, Catherine had titanium mesh implanted on the left side of her skull. In October, the mesh was replaced with a titanium plate, which takes the place of the side of her skull that the bullet shattered.
Catherine still has visual impairment, difficulty swallowing and a number of other medical challenges because of the wound, said Dr. Kathy Silverman, a pediatrician who worked with her for three months.
"The brain is the control center for the body," Dr. Silverman said. "So it's not just the brain but every other organ system that you have to keep an eye on when a child comes in with that kind of injury."
Dr. Silverman, who has worked at the hospital, north of New York City, for more than 20 years, has treated a number of children with gunshot wounds over her career, including children who have shot themselves, those who have been targeted by shooters and those like Catherine, who were caught in the crossfire.
"Having one child with gunshot wounds is one too many," Dr. Silverman said. "This is a child that needs to be followed over time very closely by a number of physicians, a rehab doctor, a pediatrician, her surgeons, and she needs that intensive rehab to be able to gain the functional skills back."
"She's still very young," Dr. Silverman added.
Cheerios and a climbing wall
For a while, Catherine refused to sit in a car seat.
"I guess maybe she felt the same way she was like when it happened," Ms. Gomez said, "feeling what she was sitting in at the time, so we had to switch it up."
Catherine's car seat is no longer secured to the middle of the back seat as it was the night of the shooting, and is instead buckled in behind the driver's seat. To the right of the seat, the dent the bullet made can still be seen in the car's leather interior.
On a recent morning, Ms. Gomez picked Catherine up out of her car seat and carried her into the hospital for therapy. Catherine would spend the next three hours in a program for children with medically complex needs. One young boy wore a yellow backpack that contained feeding tubes. A 3-year-old girl had a tracheotomy to help her breathe.
The classroom was full of natural light streaming in from four skylights. Children squealed and giggled as they played.
"I make a bottle," Catherine said as she held toy milk up to a doll in a white highchair. "Good job!" the staff called out. "Yay! You did it!"
But the morning wasn't just for play. Catherine would also undergo dysphagia therapy: exercises to help her eat and drink on her own.
"Which one do you want? Froot Loops or Cheerios?" Gina D. Longarzo, a therapist, asked. Catherine pointed to the heart-shaped Cheerios, kicking her legs under the table.
"We're going to pour the milk," Ms. Longarzo said. "Do you want to help Gina?"
The gunshot wound slowed Catherine's muscles and the timeliness of her swallowing. She initially had a nasal gastric tube before she graduated to eating purée and thick liquids.
Now, she's working on solids, thin liquids and her aversion to food.
"Good job, baby!" Ms. Longarzo said as Catherine used her left hand to lift a pink spoon, with her name written on the handle, to her mouth. "Yay!"
"Heart!" Catherine exclaimed, analyzing the contents of her bowl. "Nice heart!"
Catherine had been crawling and standing before the shooting, but the injury set her back. Initially, her physical therapy involved learning again to sit upright and to control her trunk and head without support.
That day, her task in physical therapy was to scale a rock-climbing wall and grab Mickey Mouse heads attached to string, to practice using both sides of her body. In her pink floral Nike sneakers she jumped, climbed and crawled beneath an obstacle course set up near the wall.
"She's doing really well," said Brendan Bacon, her physical therapist. He plans to make sure she continues to hit her milestones.
Catherine's parents are doing their best to make sure she has the treatment she needs. Early on, Ms. Gomez and Mr. Arias exhausted not only the $ 8,000 they had in savings, but also $ 30,000 they had received through a GoFundMe campaign that a family member set up for them, largely because they didn't have health benefits at the time of the shooting; they do now. They said they were still scrambling to make ends meet.
Catherine's older sisters are in trauma therapy. Haylee, 12, has shut down emotionally, Ms. Gomez said. Seven-year-old Delilah, formerly a star student, has become defiant and uninterested in completing her schoolwork.
'A miracle'
On Aug. 9, federal authorities announced the arrests of Ahmed Altorei and Samuel Bautista in connection with Catherine's shooting. Mr. Altorei, 36, and Mr. Bautista, 30, were charged with distributing drugs and carrying guns in connection with a drug trafficking operation, federal prosecutors said in an unsealed indictment.
The U.S. attorney, Damian Williams, called it "a miracle" that Catherine survived the shooting, but said "the emotional and physical trauma will never go away."
Ms. Gomez and Mr. Arias brought Catherine to the men's first court appearance. Ms. Gomez said she was surprised to see that they had no family there with them.
"That, to me, shows that perhaps they, as children, found a way to fit in and found love in the streets, which is why they lead those lifestyles," Ms. Gomez said. She wondered what was missing in their childhoods -- and said she initially had the urge to hug them.
One of the men looked remorseful, Ms. Gomez said, but the other seemed to scrutinize her family judgmentally. Whatever fleeting compassion she had was gone.
If the men are convicted, Ms. Gomez said, she prays that their time in prison teaches them something. For now, the family plans to keep attending the court appearances, and bringing Catherine.
"This little face: That's going to be your cross to bear every day," Mr. Arias said.
In the meantime, the family continues to take Catherine to her treatments. They are saving money to move, perhaps to North Carolina.
Ms. Gomez said Catherine still gets headaches near where the bullet entered her skull: "She'll point to the wound, where the bullet went in, and she'll say, 'boo-boo, boo-boo."'

Criminal Stories From Beyond These Borders: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Four picks across television, film and podcast that will take American viewers and listeners to places with vastly different systems and understandings of justice.
The true crime genre can often feel very America-centric: Crimes that take place in the United States, with American perpetrators, victims and investigators. So the systems at play -- political, legal, cultural, press -- are all anchored to a similar playbook, and the failures and successes of these systems can feel repetitive.
But lately, more documentaries and podcasts take audiences far from American shores and immerse them in societies with very different customs and expectations -- and little in common with how crimes are approached, understood, pursued and solved in the United States. Here are four picks that will transport American viewers and listeners.
"Wanted: The Escape of Carlos Ghosn"
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
This four-part docuseries on Apple TV+ takes viewers on a well-paced ride between Japan, France and Lebanon that involves an escape almost too fantastical for Hollywood. At its center is Carlos Ghosn, a Lebanese chief executive, born in Brazil and raised in Lebanon and France, with a Midas touch when it came to automakers. Among other feats, he brought Nissan back from the brink of failure about 25 years ago. By doing so, he became a glitzy and beloved figure in Japan, until he was arrested there for alleged financial wrongdoings.
Along the way -- through interviews with journalists, Ghosn's wife, his associates (business and otherwise) and Ghosn himself -- the stark differences in how executive compensation, justice, surveillance and criminal investigations are thought of and handled in these various countries are on display.
"Missing: The Lucie Blackman Case"
The police processes of Japan are explored from another angle in this Netflix documentary, which tells the story of Lucie Blackman, a 21-year-old British woman who was living and working in Tokyo when she went missing in 2000. Immediately after, her distraught family, led by her unyielding father, traveled there and -- after proving that they would not be dismissed or diminished -- spurred a massive search for her.
Cultural clashes frustrate the family and complicate the effort, and you may finish this documentary with as many questions as when you started (though they will be very different questions). Unlike many true-crime stories, there is closure to the case, and the outcome is shocking.
"Notes on a Scandal"
In this podcast, one of Pakistan's first in the true crime realm, we travel to Karachi in the late 1960s and early '70s, when the city's lust-fueled nightlife and high-society scandals would rival the most sensational eras of Hollywood or New York.
This story has it all: the mysterious death of a tortured poet, Mustafa Zaidi, whose body was found next to his unconscious muse and lover, the socialite Shahnaz Gul, renown for her beauty; a rumored suicide pact; an exhumation; a murder trial; breathless media coverage; and even revenge porn, which was not digital as we understand it today, but printed on thousands of fliers.
The show's hosts, Tooba Masood and Saba Imtiaz, Pakistan-based journalists, have been researching the circumstances surrounding Zaidi's death for years. Over two seasons, they share their findings in great detail, attempt to apply logic to the gossip of that time and debate the legitimacy of the possible scenarios. This is an independent podcast, and some might find the format -- a conversation between the hosts, with a couple of notable guests in Season 2 -- simplistic, but there is nothing simple or boring about the tale they've resurfaced.
"Rough Translation: Love Commandos"
In India, arranged marriage, as its known in the West, is simply known as marriage -- but marrying for love, which still accounts for only a small fraction of marriage there, is an anomaly called "love marriage." As we learn in "Love Commandos," the final season of NPR's "Rough Translation" podcast, love marriage can be a dangerous, even deadly, proposition for the young couples who follow their hearts instead of their parents' wishes.
In this five-episode podcast -- hosted by Gregory Warner, guest-hosted by Mansi Choksi and drawing on years of reporting by the NPR correspondent Lauren Frayer -- listeners are taken to modern-day India, where a mysterious Delhi-based group called Love Commandos has for about a decade offered shelter and safety to those who marry for love. Now, its leader, Sanjoy Sachdev, is facing allegations of extortion. As Warner puts it, "Escape is far from the same thing as freedom."
Over five episodes, we hear from couples who've lived at the Love Commandos compound and from Sachdev himself. But the possible crimes perpetrated by Sachdev in many ways take a back seat to some of the painful details that illustrate the prevalence and normalization of fear, harassment, abuse and human rights violations seemingly inherent to love marriages -- details that abound in nearly every story told.

Full text: Our critic recommends two fantastic documentaries and a dreamy French show about a 70-year-old pregnant woman.
This weekend I have ... a half-hour, and I want something dreamy.
'Nona and Her Daughters'
When to watch: Now, on MHz Choice.
Nona (Miou-Miou) is a 70-year-old Parisian sex educator and mother of adult triplet daughters who is understandably shocked to find herself pregnant. Even more surprising, her boyfriend is somehow not the baby's father. Over nine half-hour episodes, "Nona" (in French, with subtitles) weaves together whimsy and sorrow, quirk and thoughtfulness. And my god, the wallpaper. Magical realism is unusual on television, and it is deployed here gently and judiciously, though the mesmerizing effect is sometimes dashed by the characters' apparent inability ever to put their phones on silent.
... three hours, and I hate sitting still.
'Telemarketers'
When to watch: The first two episodes are available on Max; Episode 3 airs Sunday at 10 p.m., on HBO.
This three-part documentary about the depravity of the telemarketing industry has a compelling journalistic through line, but the real draw is the intimacy and vitality of its portraiture. "Telemarketers" began when one of its directors, Sam Lipman-Stern, started filming his co-workers at a New Jersey call center, including Patrick J. Pespas, a star salesman, serious drug user and among the most charismatic people you will see on television. The piece evolved when Lipman-Stern moved to Los Angeles (where he says he "shot a few weddings, bar mitzvahs, some foot stuff"), but it retains an admirable shagginess, especially in contrast to the sterile Mad Libs of a lot of nonfiction shows of the moment.
... four hours, and I like white-collar scandals.
'Wanted: The Escape of Carlos Ghosn'
When to watch: Arrives Friday, on Apple TV+.
For those who prefer their documentaries much glossier, there is this juicy and fascinating story of the automotive industry executive Carlos Ghosn. The tale is a wild one: Ghosn was the head of Nissan and Renault and was arrested in Japan for financial misdeeds. After being held there in what he called unjust conditions, he escaped -- in a trunk on a private plane, in a caper orchestrated by a former Green Beret. "Wanted" is elegantly straightforward, letting the outrageousness of the saga unfold with lucid talking-head explanations. If you enjoy high-end moral ambiguity, dig in.

The Video Game Was Only the Beginning: [Review]

Full text: A popular racing video game series gets turned into an underdog sports drama in this big-screen adaptation.
Since the late 1990s, the Gran Turismo racing games for PlayStation have brought in billions of dollars, rivaling the box-office bounties of some movie franchises. It was only a matter of time before a movie offshoot arrived, following in the tracks of other live-action adaptations of PlayStation games, including last year's "Uncharted." "Gran Turismo" the movie tells the true (but unlikely) story of Jann Mardenborough, a Gran Turismo maven who became a professional racer of actual cars on actual tracks.
Mardenborough's leap from pixels to asphalt was an effective advertisement for Gran Turismo as more than a game, but his transition wasn't all smooth. In the director Neill Blomkamp's dutiful telling, Jann (Archie Madekwe), a teenager from Cardiff, Wales, faces doubters and steep learning curves to go with the racetrack curves. His underdog story -- can this digital driver make it in the real world? -- doubles as an old-fashioned tale of a young man proving his worth to his family and other skeptics.
Madekwe's Jann is so unassuming that every step in his journey comes as a pleasant surprise. After Jann's father (Djimon Hounsou) says there's no future in gaming and brings Jann to his job at a rail yard, Jann goes off and wins a contest held by Nissan to recruit promising Gran Turismo players. (His mother, played by Geri Halliwell Horner, is a bit more encouraging.) He earns a spot in the company's racing academy, which is overseen by a hard-nosed engineer, Jack (David Harbour), and an unctuous marketer, Danny (Orlando Bloom). Once again Jann exceeds expectations and beats out a more TV-ready competitor for the chance to race professionally.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The movie begins to resemble the levels in a video game, as Jann enters races worldwide to clinch his contract with Nissan. He finally beats an obnoxious front-runner (Josha Stradowski) in Dubai and celebrates in Tokyo, but he flips his car on his next race (as the real Mardenborough did in 2015, though the film adjusts the chronology). Like many sports movies, there's no shortage of training and competition -- the perpetual buildup. A finale comes at Le Mans, the annual 24-hour race.
Blomkamp's handling of the track scenes lacks a compelling physicality, or (if you'll pardon the term) drive -- the editing and camerawork could each use a sharper sense of rhythm and velocity. That might not matter so much if it were paired with a strong screenplay, but the platitudinous script here lacks flair (though Jann does have the likable quirk of listening to Enya or Kenny G to chill out before races). Madekwe conveys a youthful vulnerability and an appealing air of quiet doggedness, even if he's mild-mannered as a performer here. The movie doesn't need to achieve the same levels of sensation as a wildly popular racing simulator, but it should convey excitement and dynamism in its own cinematic way. When the novelty of watching a gamer become a driver wears off, we're left with an adequate racing drama in a medium built for so much more.

Full text: In terms of song structure, I was really inspired by Kanye West, Common, Lupe Fiasco and Mos Def -- that type of rap where there can be messaging and maybe some political themes, but the song is pretty standard in terms of hooks and bridges. A lot of sung choruses, that kind of a thing. I tend to like writing hooks that are catchy. I really like catchy-sounding production with thoughtful lyricism. That's what I tend to gravitate to.
I have this very vivid memory of my mom playing "Late Registration" in her Nissan Pathfinder when I was a kid, and just being in the back seat, listening.
And then when I wanted my songs to be a little more deconstructed, Jay Electronica and Earl Sweatshirt. "Eternal Sunshine (The Pledge)," that tape from Jay, I've never heard a rap album sound like that, or someone attempt to rap to a movie score. That was very eye-opening to me, in terms of what the genre could do. Same with MF Doom, "Madvillainy." I had never heard anything like that. "Oh, rap could do this?"
At the time, I wasn't really a hip-hop head. Teenybopper hip-hop. "Doggy Bag," 2001 -- wow. He definitely had a moment. That was my childhood, as far as rap was concerned. It was not exciting.
A lot of the stuff that I was into was based on what I could listen to. My mom wasn't really allowing me to listen to too much. She was like, "You can listen to this Michael Jackson and one Kanye album." And whatever's playing on the radio. It was that vibe. I would go to my friend's house and they would be listening to Wayne mixtapes.
I'm just now starting to become a real music fan, where I can listen to a lot more genres and styles. Stylistically, in terms of pockets and playing around with language, my generation doesn't really do that that much, just across the board. And that's the type of hip-hop that I think I like the most. I've been going back to Slick Rick and Big Pun, Big L, stuff that's either punchline driven or people are just hitting very crazy pockets. As far as new rappers, probably Boldy James, billy woods, Silkmoney. You know Babyface Ray? I liked his last tape.
I'm kind of late being a musician.
I don't know why I make the type of music that I make sometimes. Because it's truly not really popular.
I feel like everyone is trying to stay away from the type of stuff that I do because they want money. They want to sustain themselves. Not even trying to be self-deprecating, but I really don't hear folks making kind of weird poetic [expletive] like this.
Although hip-hop wasn't my entry point, being in organizing spaces -- Black radical spaces where folks are thinking about leftist politics and ideologies -- I was able to find rappers and hip-hop artists that actually do make that type of music. I guess it does lead back into hip-hop, which I didn't realize. Aspects of it were in the Black radical tradition. I wish that aspect of it was a bit more to the mainstream, but it is what it is.

Over five decades, hip-hop has grown from a new art form to a culture-defining superpower. In their own words, 50 influential voices chronicle its evolution.
—
KOOL MOE DEE
The first time I remember being exposed to what we’re calling hip-hop now is Lovebug Starski on the mic at the Renaissance in New York, 138th and 7th Avenue. It was something I felt in my inner being. There was something going on inside me that said, I wanted to be a part of what that was.
Being a child of Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali, that whole revolutionary thought process was part of my DNA. I was pretty let down that the draft was done by the time I was 12, because I so looked forward to the day that I could be like Muhammad Ali. I was looking forward to not enlisting. So when I saw hip-hop, I had the same feeling: I’ll have a platform. That was my primary thought: I get the chance to do my Malcolm X thing on a mic one day. Hip-hop gave me the first inkling of that being possible.
Melle Mel was the first person that made me think that it was possible to take the lyrical content to where I wanted to take it. But Earth, Wind & Fire and Stevie Wonder gave me the inkling that you could actually put lyrics together and make an impact beyond just the music. “Songs in the Key of Life” was the most double-entendre, witty thought process, just in terms of the poetry in the title alone. And Maurice White — forget about it. When I heard the record “Fantasy” — “You will find/Other kind/That has been in search for you” — that was absolute peak metaphor for me. The fact that they were doing that kind of poetry on top of music was my actual genuine, genuine, genuine, genuine inspiration. I would say a calling, quite frankly.
I could not believe that Earth, Wind & Fire felt similar about me that I did about them. We were doing a cruise a couple years back, and they were rushing through the galleys to try to get to my show. When Verdine White broke down the difference in my cadence from the average MC? I was floating.
At one point, we were being belittled and looked down upon: That’s that bibbity-bop hip-hop stuff. But when Public Enemy and Chuck D got to be the center of attention, I was proud to say I was a rapper. “I do what they do.” Public Enemy took us beyond where most people thought we could take it. I make a little analogy that hip-hop has given Black America the chance to experience what white privilege feels like.
SCARFACE
I think my earliest memories were hearing the Sugarhill Gang’s “Rapper’s Delight” in 1979, and then the Soul Sonic Force, “Planet Rock.” I remember Kurtis Blow had a record called “Way Out West” — “Way out West from way back East/Coming from the place you’d expect the least/There came a stranger dressed in black/from a Harlem town a long way back/Had a Stetson hat with a band of gold.” I still remember it ’til this day. That’s the impact Kurtis Blow had on hip-hop.
I started going up to New York in my early teenage years, and started hearing and seeing the real elements of hip-hop, listening to WBLS on the radio. My cousin from uptown would send tapes to me, so I would always have the new hip-hop first.
In Houston, there was a hip-hop show called “Kidz Jamm” that came on 90.9. FM. There was also a local DJ by the name of Darryl Scott. That’s how we really got turned on to hip-hop. The first local artist I heard was Captain Jack. He was a DJ, and he made a record called “Jack It Up.”
I was a DJ first. My main influence was Jam Master Jay, the ultimate of all DJs. Then came the DJ that could rap: Grandmaster Dee from Whodini, right? I could rap, too, so I knew if I ever had to battle Grandmaster Dee I was going to douse his ass. That’s what I prepared my whole DJ career on: battling Grandmaster Dee.
I liked to cut Eric B. & Rakim’s “Eric B. Is President” and the Beastie Boys’ “Hold It Now, Hit It.” I was more the backspin, cut and spin DJ — I got into learning how to transform later. But as time went on I started moving more towards writing rhymes and producing.
The early Geto Boys made a song called “Car Freak,” and I thought they were famous, you know? But I didn’t know the realities of the music business until I got with Jukebox, Ready Red, Bushwick Bill and Willie D. Prince Johnny C had left the group, and when Jukebox left, it was just me, Will and Bill. That’s when we made “Grip It! On That Other Level.” Me and Willie did all the writing, we wrote for Bill.
I always tell people that I’m a hip-hop hybrid of Ice Cube, Chuck D and Big Daddy Kane. I wanted to be able to tell a story like Cube. I wanted to be very lyrical like Kane. And I wanted to have an in-your-face delivery like Chuck. As much respect as I have for Nas and Jay-Z, if it hadn’t been for that previous level of intensity in rhyming, I wouldn’t be me.
I’m just thankful that LL Cool J talked to my mom on the telephone during the New Music Seminar. This was when I first started rapping, a few months before “Mind Playing Tricks on Me.” This was the first time the Geto Boys got the chance to perform in New York, had to be around ’90. I don’t know what my mom and LL talked about, but I was on a pay phone with my mom and I was just so glad. And the Geto Boys got booed!
I think there were some artists booing us. Some of the other group members think it was probably A Tribe Called Quest. Nah, I’m just messing with you, because me and Q-Tip are cool as hell. That’s where we met, out in New York. And we toured together, too.
Q-Tip and I have formed a really dope friendship. He’ll just call and say, “Man, I’m just calling to tell you I love you, bro …” Well, I love you, too, Tip. That’s a very different matchup.
Being somebody that was born with this manic depressive mindset and just a sick disorder mentally, I found an outlet through my music. You saw me succeed. You saw me fail. I know that hip-hop saved me. But at the same time it took away from me being a good father, a good husband, a good son, a good uncle. The music stole me from everything that I should have been, but it still made me everything that I could have been, if that makes sense.
EVE
Hip-hop was always around me at a very young age. I had a big family that all lived together and my aunt loved LL Cool J — like, looooved . She always played his music around the house and went to every concert when he came to Philadelphia.
The neighborhood we lived in always had block parties with DJs in the summertime, ’84, ’85. Meredith Street — they’ve since torn them down, but we used to call it “down bottom,” 46th Street. You’re kind of in your own world when you live in the projects. Everybody knows everybody. So it’s a celebration of the summer and food and culture. But at the same time, it was not always the safest.
The music was full on Salt-N-Pepa, Queen Latifah, Fresh Prince — he wasn’t Will Smith then, he was just Fresh Prince. Along with tons of soul music. My biological father is a DJ, so there was music on that side as well.
A lot of the reason I went into hip-hop was the females. What I saw in them was women who were holding their own up against the boys, but still celebrating their femininity. MC Lyte’s “Cappucino” — I can totally remember the video. What was I, 10? I thought she was so damn fly. She had this long black coat on, but then her hair was stacked and shaved in the back. I wanted to get my hair cut like hers.
I always sang and I would write poems. But it wasn’t really until ABC came out — Another Bad Creation — when I was like, I want to start rapping. I formed a little girl’s group then — DGP, Dope Girl Posse — and we would do a lot of their songs, En Vogue, Color Me Badd. We did every talent show in Philly.
But I didn’t really start getting real serious until I got to high school, and I was very much a battle rapper. I was the girl who loved to get in a cypher. I started listening more to Lil’ Kim, Biggie, and my sound switched up. Philly is definitely different. We were known for being battle rappers, but a lot of Philly style is kind of more backpack and I just didn’t gravitate towards that.
It was fast and punchy, go-for-the-jugular. Because I used to battle rap against dudes all the time, I would just go at it and hurt their egos. It was basically just talking [expletive]. I always had stuff in the chamber. It’s very easy battling high school boys, ego-wise. It’s literally the truth: “You’re broke and you live with your mom.” Talk about their [expletive] size, and then you’re done.
It was always important for me just to be good — not good for a girl. I looked at those cyphers as honing my skills. I never turned one down. I went to Martin Luther King High School, and I’d cut and have like two or three lunches just to battle people. In the cafeteria, by the locker, the back stairs, whatever. On the weekends, South Street, there would just be cyphers on the corner. My full name was pretty much “Eve, That Girl With the Blonde Hair That Can Rap.”
Once I stepped in the studio I realized what a song was. We used to work with this one producer, Marv, who was really good at structure. I just wanted to do 24 bars and he was like, Bro, that’s not a song — you need a hook. We paid him when we could. Maybe bring him a bag of weed or something.
My first deal was with Dr. Dre. I auditioned for his A&R at the time, Mike Lynn. My managers were like, we’re going to put this beat on and you just rap. And I did. He literally called Dre right after I was finished, like, Yo, I think we found our girl.
When I was signed to Dre, one of his producers who I did my demo with was like, Yo, you have to meet this kid DMX. This was way before I knew what Ruff Ryders was. It just so happened we were under the same umbrella of Interscope. And after Dre dropped me, Jimmy Iovine said I’d be great with Ruff Ryders.
I just wasn’t happy waiting in the wings. I started getting on Dre’s nerves. They didn’t know the direction to put me in, but I’m very happy I got dropped, because once I got with Ruff Ryders, it was my boot camp. I thought I knew how to write a song — not really. I was told to slow down my flow. I needed to be humbled, and being dropped will do that. That being said, I went on to make some of my greatest records — the song I won a Grammy for [“Let Me Blow Ya Mind”] — with Dr. Dre. That was when I knew who I was, though.
I had a lot of opinions about how I thought I should sound. A lot of my ideas got shot down. The music industry was trying to put me in a box — the box inside the box inside the box. Luckily, I got to hang out with and look up to people like Missy Elliott and Trina and Lauryn Hill and Queen Latifah, who became a big blueprint for how I wanted my career to go, coming from hip-hop, but also being able to transcend.
I was a huge No Doubt fan — like, huuuge . I loved Gwen Stefani and nobody understood what I was saying when I wanted to do the song with her. People looked at me like I was crazy. But we’re the same in the sense that we’re girly girls who are also tomboys — the girl with the boys, because I was that. I knew she’d want to hang out with the girls because she’s always with boys. We just clicked.
Now I love Leikeli47, Doja Cat — she’s so freaking dope. Her lyrics are amazing. Coi Leray. Latto is lyrically great. I love Megan, Cardi, Nicki. I love the fact that there’s so many women that I can actually name. There were years when I would be like: Where . Are . The Women ? It’d be the one or the two. Finally, there is an actual landscape. I love it.
ICE CUBE
I knew a lot of slick-talking dudes that would rhyme all the time. Everybody had a little rap somewhere. I remember Teena Marie, Blondie — Muhammad Ali was rapping. It was just the cool thing to do.
But it wasn’t until songs like “Buffalo Gals,” “More Bounce to the Ounce,” “8th Wonder,” “La Di Da Di” — these are the songs that started to really get me turned on to rap. Blowfly had a song called “Rapp Dirty,” and when we were in fifth grade my friend and I would wait till his mama left and we would just play “Rapp Dirty” and Prince songs like “Head.” The adults would try to make you go to bed when it was time to listen to those records.
I loved KRS-One. He had a lot of different styles, a lot of different techniques. And he had one of the coldest names ever when you broke it down: Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone. He was an in-your-face rapper who came with style and intelligence. “Criminal Minded,” “The Blueprint” — masterpieces. He’s just one of the best that ever blessed the mic.
My first group, the Stereo Crew, had a song with Epic Records that didn’t hit. I don’t know if we sold five of them. We got dropped after that single. There were local groups we looked up to that were way bigger: Uncle Jamm’s Army, L.A. Dream Team, the Wreckin’ Cru, King Tee, Ice-T, of course. Toddy Tee and Mix Master Spade, Joe Cooley, Rodney-O. They were all starting to make noise.
Me, Sir Jinx and K-Dee, or Kid Disaster, we was going around joining rap contests and battles. We could never get into the talent shows because they didn’t want rap music back then. It was a hobby. There was a little money from playing shows, but nothing to think that you could not have a regular job.
I went to a trade school called Phoenix Institute of Technology, in Phoenix, Ariz., and got a certificate in architectural drafting. I already had a hit record at the time — N.W.A had “Dope Man” out. Dre kept saying, “You sure you want to go to school?”
I got entrenched into the hip-hop community in Phoenix at the time. Artists would come through and perform at a place called the Celebrity Theater — Fat Boys, Doug E. Fresh, EPMD. They knew I had a hit record out, so they would let me kick it backstage.
I was going back and forth every other weekend because Southwest had a great deal — $50 for a one-way ticket. When I graduated, in September ’88, we was in the middle of making Eazy’s “Eazy-Duz-It” album.
This was dirty, underground, hardcore rap. Explicit lyrics. We all thought we would have records in the Rudy Ray Moore section, next to the Richard Pryor records. Who would play this? Who would make this mainstream? We were being told that we were fools for spending our money to make records that couldn’t get played on the radio. It was just a ridiculous notion. But Eazy didn’t care — he felt like if a hundred people played it, that was good enough.
ICE SPICE
Middle school was a really important time, that’s when I realized that I was into hip-hop, specifically. All the mainstream artists, to be honest, that are GOAT-ed now. A lot of Drake, Nicki, Kendrick.
My dad rapped — he’s pretty private, so I wasn’t like, sitting there listening to his mixtapes. I would say he’s more like a freestyle type of rapper. It’s not like that was his whole life, but thinking back, that’s probably where it could have sparked for me, personally.
When drill started happening, I remember listening to a lot of Pop Smoke and Sheff G and Sleepy Hallow. I just enjoyed the overall feelings that the music gives, that summertime vibe. In my earphones, that’s what I was playing. Just listening to their beat selections and their choice of topics, I feel like that inspired me a lot.
I’m still growing and learning as an artist. I wouldn’t even say like, we’re fully here. Like we’ve arrived at my sound. It’s always changing and evolving. But I feel like in a couple years people will refer to this as my “Like..?” era.
My approach is really a reflection of my personality. That’s just how I am in real life. And I feel like I’ve always been influencing people, even before everything popped off, whether it was at school or whatever the case. But now it’s on a bigger scale, so it’s way better now. It’s musically, but also when it comes to how people wear their hair or how they wanna wear their makeup, how they wear their nails. Even with the lingo, certain things they say in songs, beat selection, cadence, personality. There’s so much to take inspo from.
But, you know, I feel like we’re all constantly influencing each other. I do the same thing in my own way. Like, I’ve taken inspo from so many different pieces of the world that I can only be flattered by it, you know what I’m saying? Like whenever I find myself almost feeling a certain way — like, Oh, why this person sound just like me or why they trying to look like me? — I have to remember like, that’s the whole point. That’s just how art works.
LADYBUG MECCA
I grew up in the DMV, and my friend had a lot of family in Brooklyn. So he would travel there and spend summers and he would record the Red Alert radio show on cassette. At that time in the DMV — this was like ’85, ’86 — go-go had more presence than hip-hop, so we were a select few that were even into it on that level. I became obsessed. It was just so fly and next level. I had already been writing my observations about the world down on like, little pieces of paper or napkins. So hearing people expressing themselves through words, through rhymes, through cadence, it just grabbed me, you know?
The Jungle Brothers really stands out for me in terms of those cassettes. Everything sonically, like the rhythms, the tone of their vocals, their wordplay. Musically, it was just a sound that I hadn’t really heard. It felt like the future, like complete freedom of expression, being like completely free in your skin. That’s the best way I can explain it.
I learned to rap by listening. I really loved MC Lyte. Queen Latifah’s “Wrath of My Madness” was mind-blowing, just out of this world. And Public Enemy, their rhythm spoke to my internal rhythm, you know what I mean? It was just like family, you know, I don’t know how else to explain it.
In high school, my other close friends had a hip-hop group and I started off dancing for them. And then I started writing and doing little shows, like local stuff. And it became very, very serious once, you know, Knowledge and Ishmael [Doodlebug and Butterfly] asked me to be in the group. That’s when it became a reality, like I could do this possibly for a living.
When we were out, we felt connected to the whole Native Tongues. Tribe, De La of course. Arrested Development. Gang Starr. I’m heavily influenced by Sweet Tee’s music. I looked to everyone, like Special Ed, Big Daddy Kane, all these people, they’re my inspiration. Daddy Kane was so smooth and cool, he was just everything. I couldn’t wait to get home to turn on the TV and watch music videos and just see what new I could absorb.
PROJECT PAT
My earliest memory is LL Cool J and some of the New York rappers. And of course, N.W.A and Ice Cube. But Scarface and the Geto Boys, man. Face is the one. I could visualize what he was saying. I hadn’t heard nobody tell a story about living down South. On one line Face was talking about how he was selling dope in the apartments, and that’s the stuff I was seeing in Memphis.
I grew up on DJ Squeeky — Squeeky used to have the club rocking. I listened to 8Ball & MJG. And anything Cash Money. Those are our guys, we was messing with them before they made it big. Paul and Juicy was on them before they even blew up.
When I made my first tape, I had a robbery charge pending. They were trying to give me 30 years, so I wasn’t thinking about no future in rap. But my brother and I could always make a word rhyme. I grew up around a lot of pimps on the street. I would ask them about their little pimp sayings. I would hear them saying it and I would flip it and turn it around in my raps. The pimps were my major influence.
Back in the days, New York didn’t accept rappers who weren’t from there. So I knew I made it when Funkmaster Flex dropped a bomb on my song. I was in New York one time and this is when “Sippin’ on Some Syrup” was rolling. Three 6 Mafia had sold something like 2 million copies of the whole album. So Flex dropped a bomb on “Sippin’ on Some Syrup,” right? And then he turned around and played “Chickenhead” and dropped a bomb on that one. I couldn’t believe it.
Then I did a show back in 2010 in New York, and the whole ASAP Rocky crew was there. I couldn’t believe it. And I was the headliner and the whole show was sold out. And when Cardi B made that “Bickenhead” song, man, that was a blessing. We love all the different artists that came after us — they keep us alive.
TRIPPIE REDD
My mom would listen to oldies, like, Tupac, Biggie, Jay-Z, Ja Rule, that soulful sound. And my dad listened to more like street underground from back in that era. People like Rich the Factor, Jadakiss, the Jacka and Ampichino, Fred the Godson. And then my uncle would listen to like more of the newer stuff, like Wayne and Drake and Thug. On my own time, when it came to YouTube, I would go listen to like rock, so like Kiss and the Red Jumpsuit Apparatus. I used to play Saints Row and they had a track on the game and it made me a fan.
My brother passed away when I was young, so that kind of gave me that drive to start wanting to make music. And I would sit at my grandma’s house and just rap on the stairs and be there for like two, three hours, just freestyling. We would have little things at school where we would have to write, so I would show my pen skills. I would make my school projects cool. Like, oh, I’m gonna write a letter to Drake. I literally did that too. I wrote a rap to Drake. I was in like seventh grade.
I started like experimenting with Auto-Tune and getting to my own sound. Auto-Tune and stuff like that, it got me into SoundCloud. That was like the beginning of like that super underground phase, Ugly God and Playboi Carti and Lil Uzi Vert, I started making music around the same time as them. But I didn’t blow up until the XXXTentacion and Juice WRLD era. I liked X and Lil Peep. If you go to my SoundCloud, it was really X, Lil Peep and then Uzi, too.
Lil Peep was on that sad boy [expletive]. That was hard. I love that. Just that feeling of, you know, depression and sadness and pain. That’s kind of where I was at the time, I felt like their movement is fire. Like they’re doing exactly what I envision myself doing.
I also listen to a lot of rock, though. I love Chino from Deftones. He’s passionately in character with his vocals. It’s like you gotta make certain movements and certain faces to hit certain notes. Sometimes he’ll just like go from like a melody to breathing and it sounds the same, like the melody and the breathing is all in one. It just sounds hard to me.
I’m not quite a rapper. I’m the odd man out. People mistake me for a rapper and then it’ll leave me in that box. So the way I could stay out of that box is by creating music that keeps me out of it.
CARDI B
An unforgettable moment as a child was when I saw Missy Elliott take off her head in the “One Minute Man” video, and that just made me like, go crazy for it. That’s all I wanted. It’s like, I don’t want to hear Barney anymore, you know what I’m saying? I don’t want to hear Disney movies music anymore. I just automatically got into hip-hop.
My female cousins that were older than me, they always listened to Lil’ Kim, Foxy, all the girls that was out at the moment. I always remember, my mom used to be like, “Don’t be playing that too much around the kids.” Then I got into Trina’s type of music. Trina makes like, you know, a nasty, freak nasty type of music. Lil’ Kim does freak nasty too, but I feel like they have different types of style. The route for me was more of a Trina route. It’s crazy because I’m a New Yorker, but I was always into that Trina and the Khia and the Jacki-O type of vibe.
As a teen, it just made me be like, yeah, “I wanna be [expletive] like them.” And that’s how I really am, actually. I started doing music when I was 23, but I was listening to these girls at 15, 16, 17, 18. So the personality that their music gave me stuck to me.
At the time, I just stopped stripping, so I was very much still in that whole stripper world. I wanted the music to be about me. My first song, “Washpoppin’,” it’s like, “I need all my moneymakers bring that cash out/I need all my D-boys to bring that cash out.” It was get money type of music. And then I also was making music for the gangsters because I felt like I was just such a gangster-ass little bitch.
My manager, he used to have long conversations with me like, how do you feel? I used to be like, oh, you know, I feel overwhelmed, sometimes I feel really tired. And then he would ask me weird questions like, so how do your boyfriend make you feel? How do you feel about love? How do you feel about your past relationships? And then I would have a conversation with him about my past relationships and my traumas. And then he’ll be like, oh, OK, so put that on your music. And that’s when I started to talk more about other things than just the things that I was doing in my past, like gang [expletive], street [expletive] and stripper [expletive].
TOO SHORT
I’ve been into the whole James Brown, Bootsy Collins, George Clinton, Parliament-Funkadelic thing since fourth or fifth grade. There were a lot of songs before “Rapper’s Delight” that had a little hip-hop vibe, but just didn’t have that name. It wasn’t called rapping. And you don’t even realize it until you go back and grow up a little more and listen back to songs of your childhood. James Brown is talking and, you know, telling you the breakdown’s coming — give me the horns . It’s just there.
I don’t even know if that was related to the New York streets in the ’70s or whatever, but I do know that words and rhythms were said over disco and funk records. But you know, once “Rapper’s Delight” hit, I think the DNA of hip-hop was planted in me. I would never not like that kind of music ever again.
I’m like, 13, pushing on 14. My father has a really nice stereo system set up in the living room. I’m talking like ’79, and if you’re what they called an audiophile, which he was, you really wanted to have your speaker set up for you to sit in a certain area and get a great musical experience. I got a little window between 3:30, 4, when I get home, and 5:30, 6, when he gets home from work. So those two hours, I could play it and just play it loud. “Rapper’s Delight” was the favorite, and there was another song that came out around that time, Parliament-Funkadelic’s “(Not Just) Knee Deep.” “Rapper’s Delight” is approaching like, 15 minutes on the 12-inch and “Knee Deep” is about the same. I would just play those two records back to back — you play them twice each and an hour’s gone by, you know?
Before there was any definitive identity in music-making for myself, it was purely based on anything George Clinton did. Any relation to Parliament-Funkadelic was the inspiration for how the music should go, how the drum pattern should go, how the bass line should go, how the breakdown should go. I always look at James Brown like, you know, the New York guys already got to that. They’re getting all the best samples and you’re too late on that train right there. But not a lot of people had gotten into the Parliament-Funkadelic and just recycled the funk.
The first rappers that had a profound effect on me were Spoonie Gee and Melle Mel. Spoonie Gee was just silky smooth with it — he was a player, one of the first players, if not the first, on the microphone — and he told stories of his day, just interacting with people and the ladies. He was just my favorite. These songs are coming out about these parties and kicking it and bragging — the early days, Sugar Hill Records. Then all of a sudden, here comes a guy who’s like, I’ve met this lady and I took her to my spot and I [expletive] her. And it’s like, he’s my guy .
And Melle Mel, “The Message,” it was just an amazing insight on New York life. I was already rapping when “The Message” came out, but there was no substance to what I was doing. It motivated me to start writing songs about my city. And that changed everything.
In my tapes, I’m using all the latest slang words. I’m naming popular people in the neighborhood. I’m talking about current events, whatever is, like, really ours. We talking 1982, ’83. “Rap is hot, but we got our kid right here. Too Short, he’s ours.” The entire east side of Oakland knew about us because we sold tapes in the streets. When we went into the streets and first started selling tapes, we only sold tapes to drug dealers. We had like a paper route of drug-selling spots.
I had all these little books that I would write rhymes in and my mom found them. I don’t know what she read. She never approached me and said anything. She just wrote this long letter saying, “I didn’t raise you like this. I hope you don’t believe in this stuff. Why are you doing this?” It was enough to make a brother want to cry.
You think James Brown’s mama would have been like, boy, stop gyrating and dancing? Or Little Richard’s mama? I don’t know. It’s the next generation. And my generation right now does not understand the look and the vibe that 16-year-old rappers are on. But you look at the video and it’s 300 million hits. Somebody gets it.
DMC
I was in seventh grade, 1978. We were all in the schoolyard and Billy Morris, who was in the eighth grade, he wasn’t like a thug or a gangster, but he knew all of them. We thought he was going to try to make us smoke cigarettes and drink Night Train or Thunderbird, that 99-cent liquor. When we got over there, he had this tape recorder and said, “Check this out.” He pushed play and a beat came on and we heard this voice say, “When you keep the pep in your step you don’t stop ’til you get on the mountaintop/And when you reach the top, you reach the peak, that’s when you’ll hear Eddie Cheba speak.” That was the first time I heard hip-hop on tape.
Billy let me hold that tape for a weekend. He saw how bad I wanted it. I listened to it from Friday night all the way up to Sunday night at 10 o’clock. My moms was like, “Boy, you better get your butt in bed. You got school in the morning!”
Summer vacation comes, and now I’m seeing hip-hop at the park parties and the block parties. All that was probably going on all this time but it wasn’t until the tape that I paid attention to it. By having that tape with me for the weekend it became part of me. Now I’m open for that vibration. This was in Queens. I didn’t know anything about the Bronx. I couldn’t even leave the block!
My brother, who is three years older than me, comes home talking about getting a turntable because his friends were all getting turntables. So long story short, we didn’t sell weed. My brother and I were broke. All I had was this huge Marvel comic book collection. So my brother says, “Yo, we ain’t got no money, but D, you got a lot of comic books. We are going to do a comic books sale so we can buy some turntables and a microphone.”
Me and my brother buy the turntables. Every time he would leave, I would go to the basement and try to figure them out. It wasn’t until I heard Grandmaster Flash that I really got interested in DJing. In Queens we called them Flash tapes. These were live performances that were going on in the Bronx, Harlem and Manhattan that were coming into Queens via cassette tapes being sold like records in every hood. Flash tapes, DJ Hollywood tapes, Zulu Nation tapes were all going around Queens.
Everybody is playing that “Rapper’s Delight” song. And the only thing I really paid attention to on that song was that Superman rhyme. It was so different from all the other raps. Because I was a good student, I listened to “Rapper’s Delight” three times and learned it from start to end.
My brother brings home a record called “Superappin’” by Grandmaster Flash, the guy from the tape who had these Furious Five MCs. It changed my life because it came on with so much power. “It was a party night everybody was breaking/The highs were screamin’ and the bass was shakin’/And it won’t be long ’til everybody knowin’ that Flash was on the beat box!” It was so different from “Rapper’s Delight.” It resonated with my youthful rebellious nature. That was the day Darryl McDaniels became Easy D.
I think because I was into comic books I understood the alter ego thing. Melvin Glover is Melle Mel. Mohandas Dewese is Kool Moe Dee. They had these alter egos so I knew I could play into that.
The ones that made me want to get on the mic, of course it was Melle Mel and Kool Moe Dee. But the artists that changed my life was DJ Charlie Chase, DJ Tony Tone, and the Cold Crush Four who were Grandmaster Caz, JDL, Easy A.D. and the Almighty Kay Gee. They are the greatest group in hip-hop that a lot of people don’t know about. They kept it raw on the MC performance thing. I changed my name to DMC because of GMC, Grandmaster Caz.
“Rapper’s Delight” and “The Breaks” were cool. But the greatest period in hip-hop is the time before recorded rap. It was a live tape of the Fantastic Five vs. the Cold Crush Four at Harlem World that changed what I thought about rapping. They was playing Billy Squier’s “Big Beat,” they were taking Spoonie Gee’s “Love Rap,” and they were making routines out of them! They were flipping everything that had been done and taking it to another level. That made me say, wow, you can be a rock star with this. The attitude they had reminded me of AC/DC or Iron Maiden mixed in with George Clinton, Parliament-Funkadelic and James Brown.
For me, I took real vocal inspiration from Freddie Mercury, Robert Plant and Mick Jagger. Especially Mick because Freddie was usually very melodic. He could do opera, but Mick was different, raw. I’m the king of rock. I didn’t want to be the king of rap. All I cared about was comic books. Black music was in my house, but I saw it as my mother’s and father’s music back then. It was 30-, 40- and 50-year-olds. They are listening to all this great Black music by people like Aretha and James Brown. I didn’t get it as a kid, but with ’70s rock radio there was a station in New York City called 770 WABC. Harry Harrison and Dan Ingram, they would play James Brown, Marvin Gaye, Al Green and Aretha Franklin. But they also played Harry Chapin, Bob Dylan, Led Zeppelin, the Stones and Joni Mitchell.
So the reason why I love rock more is not only the voices were stronger, louder and powerful and they looked like superheroes, the drums and the guitars were stronger and louder. It was like the Incredible Hulk to me. So the confidence that I had was like, “OK, I may not be as eloquent in words as Moe Dee and the rest of the Treacherous Three. But if I rock this mic like I’m a member of the Rolling Stones or Led Zeppelin? If I bring that persona to hip-hop?” Man … it worked. Chuck D said it: Run-DMC showed hip-hop could be done on rock star levels. That’s why I said, “I’m the king of rock/there is none higher!”
CAMRON
I started watching, paying attention when I was 8, 9 years old. I’ll be here forever telling you a bunch of names, but people that I loved was KRS-One. Kool G Rap, Slick Rick, 3rd Bass, EPMD, A Tribe Called Quest, N.W.A, Gang Starr, De La Soul, Queen Latifah, Naughty by Nature. I remember going to the Gap trying to get polka dot shirts because Kwamé had a polka dot shirt.
To me it was neck and neck between the conscious and the street rap, then all of a sudden the gangster just took over. Maybe because what was going on outside of rap with the drugs and crime. Maybe that elevated gangster music more than regular music.
My aunt lives in Inglewood, so I used to go to California in the summers and hear the radio and they wasn’t playing what we was playing. And then I went to Navarro College in Corsicana, Texas, in ’94. And I remember getting to school and it was like a culture shock almost, ’cause it was no New York music being played. All they played was Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. Also these guys that I wasn’t aware of that had a big influence on the South, UGK. I loved it. With UGK, I think Bun B can rap with anybody, any state. I think Pimp C was more a lifestyle thing. Bun and Pimp, they mesh beautifully.
When I came home from Christmas break that year, “Shook Ones” was out and I was like, yeah, New York! I went back to school with “Shook Ones” on a cassette tape and I kept playing that every day. That had me in the New York mentality and I end up pistol-whipping somebody and getting kicked out of school.
So with me being from New York, I learned a balance. I don’t want to act like I’m not a lyricist, but then at the same time it may be too much for people. I probably have more male listeners, but I always keep in the back in my mind, I want some girls coming to my show, too. This one of my top three rappers, but I’ve never heard any girl be like, yo, throw that Kool G Rap on.
I remember when I was on the verge of getting a deal. I was at this girl house and Jay-Z was just coming out. He didn’t have an album yet. His first few singles was out. I’m like, yo, Nas is nice, man. She like, nah, I like Jay-Z. She said, Cam, I don’t want to carry a dictionary to the club with me when I go out.
That Nas and Jay-Z argument, it wasn’t just with the girl. I seen it starting to happen in different conversations and I was like, Jay is kind of the new standard. Before we had phones, when I didn’t have a deal, I used to keep 100 different loose-leaf papers in my pocket. I was like, whenever Jay-Z come out with something, I gotta come out with something because I seen where it was going and how people started adapting to him.
There wasn’t anybody that we said we need to be like them or rap like them. What I did see was that movements were always accepted. Whether it was the Native Tongues, the Hit Squad, or whether it was Cash Money or No Limit, or Roc-A-Fella or Murder Inc. I was like, I could create a team to where if you don’t like Cam, you may like Juelz. If you don’t like Juelz or Cam, you may like Jim Jones. ’Cause we used to be on my block arguing about who was the best in No Limit and people used to be like, oh, y’all don’t even know about Mr. Serv-On. And I would pay attention to these arguments and I’d be like, yo, everybody likes No Limit, but they have their favorites. So as long as you like No Limit, it don’t even really matter, ’cause you like the brand.
I remember Master P arguing with a DJ in New York. I won’t say the name. And they was trying to say, yo man, if you come to New York, we could give you this, this and this, ’cause Master P never had been in New York. And Master P, I remember him telling the DJ, look man, I don’t need New York. I don’t need y’all. I’m good. And I was like, yo, [expletive] is really eating outside of New York. So I already knew it’s an audience for that, so I always kept that in my mind.
Years later, Pimp C called me one day and he said, “Hey man, I’m about to dis the whole East Coast except for y’all. Them [expletive] up there be fronting. I believe y’all raps, man. I was at ’106 & Park,’ I seen Juelz. He had a Maserati, that thing was cute. Everybody else, they ain’t getting no money like us down here. But I think y’all are.’”
LL COOL J
It really started with the tapes that were floating around the city. The Cold Crush and the Fantastic Romantic 5 and the Force MCs and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Four, and then Five MCs. And then later on it was Fearless Four and the Treacherous Three. And Zulu Nation.
I lived between Long Island and Queens, but I actually got exposed more on Long Island because next door to me was a whole house full of foster kids, and they were from the five boroughs, but mainly the Bronx and Uptown. They were bringing tapes, some better quality than others, so I was hearing everything way earlier. I was hearing it as it was unfolding.
One day I was in the hallway in junior high, I had already been rhyming for quite a while, and this kid was singing part of a Jimmy Spicer song: “This DJ, he gets down, mixing records while they go ’round.” The light was coming through the hall and it was just me and him, he didn’t know I was there. I just remember the way he looked when he was singing that. And the way it sounded — it just clicked for me. I said, That’s what I want to do for real. I actually want to step into that dimension. It was like a dream.
From there I just started joining a lot of groups. Some rejected me. At the end of the day, I just worked really, really hard. I went everywhere. I was all over the city. I was all over Queens. I started going uptown to Harlem. At about maybe 15, 16, right before I actually ended up recording, I started hanging out with a guy named Silver Fox. Silver Fox was like a tutor for me when it came to the craft of writing rhymes and cadences and lyrics and all that. He also mentored Kool G Rap in a different way. Fox was real skillful, and he was a very prolific songwriter.
Lyrically, I was inspired by Melle Mel, Spoonie Gee, the Treacherous Three, the Fearless Four — DLB, Tito, Mighty Mike C, Peso. Those were the guys that really were into wordplay. A lot of their wordplay still holds up very well. They all had unbelievable style, and I was able to learn a lot from them. It’s kind of like I would imagine a guitar player sitting down and listening to how people roll them licks and hit them chords, and then after a while you just kind of develop your own thing.
One thing led to another. I was just sending tapes out and finally, obviously, my tape got in the hands of Rick Rubin in his dorm and Adam Horovitz of the Beastie Boys. By the time I got to “I Need a Beat,” I was ready to rhyme on any stage, in any arena, with anybody.
I did run into a little bit of arrogance here and there, which is why I’ve always tried my best not to treat anybody the way some of these guys treated me. It was a very small community, though. No industry. In other words, there were no managers. Russell Simmons ended up managing people, but he was still learning his way. There was no network of people. It was just a few believers here and there. I’m a generation 1.5 artist — myself, Run-DMC, Beastie Boys. Meaning that we tapped into the culture, evolved with the culture, but then we are the ones who went out and actually turned it into a full-blown, worldwide global industry.
BOOTS RILEY
When I was 15, I was trying to get my boy Johnny to come to police brutality rallies. I was like, man, you can rap and it’s gonna be a lot of people there. And he would be like, I’m only gonna do it if you rap, too.
Often what I was doing was just stealing Schoolly D stuff because nobody knew it. In school, pounding on the table and rapping, I was also doing theater. Somebody came up with the idea like, let’s do our own version of “West Side Story,” but we’re at East Oakland, so let’s call it “East Side Story” and let’s make it all rap. So that was my first writing.
I spoke at a rally at U.C. Berkeley, and this dude Pizo the Beat Fixer who was Too Short’s DJ for a while comes up to me and says, “Hey man, do you rap, ’cause that political [expletive] could hit right now.” I was like, yeah, matter of fact, I do. He put out an album that was me, Spice 1 and a dude named Mocedes who was known at the time because he was on Tony! Toni! Toné! song where he says, “Mocedes, the mellow.” Later on, he got known as Mopreme, Tupac’s stepbrother.
Here’s the thing with every local artist, even to this day — we’re all taught that we aren’t [expletive]. I remember I was in junior high when Too Short got to open up on the Fresh Fest. And people were talking about, oh, how they let him on, blah, blah, blah, this and that. It wasn’t until MC Hammer and Digital Underground where people started being like, oh, you know, this is something local but other people like it. You have this little town mentality. And so when we had the Coup, it took until we could show that people other places liked us to where people claim you. Because everybody wants to be connected to something important.
I mean, there was definitely a sense of teamwork happening, people sharing contacts, people wanting shows to happen. I do have to say this for the 20-year-olds that are reading, you’re not like, reposting each other’s things. You show up at each other’s thing. You’re in each other’s videos. E-40’s uncle was distributing most everybody’s stuff. At one point, my manager was Chaz Hayes, and he was managing us, Spice 1, E-40, Master P and some of the members of Tony! Toni! Toné!
“Soul Beat” on TV was the way that you also heard about stuff. They had stuff like Ice Cube when he was just in C.I.A., dancing by the pool. So the Coup and E-40 and the Click were performing at Soul Beat Day, and backstage E-40 and Studio Ton was like, “Hey, we want to do something with that lyric of yours ‘practice looking hard.’” So that’s when we started doing stuff together. We were doing a lot of car shows, lowrider shows up and down California. I still have my trophies from doing those lowrider shows.
I remember Wild Pitch said to us, we got this idea. They were like, you don’t really fit into a genre, and we think one way to get past that is to put you on a college tour. And we’re like, we’re not making no college music. Meanwhile that’s who’s buying the records, so we made a terrible mistake.
But they gave us $14,000. So we went on a 50-day tour in a minivan where we got out in each city, we put up our own posters, put up our own stickers, asked people where the record stores were and went to the record store, played them our record, made ’em listen to it.
When we got to D.C., the label was like, we’re not getting any headway with BET. We had saved up our per diem, you know, we each had $5 a day. We knocked on the door, we told Joe Clair to pick wherever he wants to go to eat. We took him to eat and hung out with him and showed him the video. And then a week later, I think it was Memorial Day, they played it crazy. Right then we were in Cleveland and people started being like, I just saw you on TV.
EARL SWEATSHIRT
My best friend when I was like 4 or 5 years old, literally in a hip-hop movie-style fashion, came over to my house with a Rob Base tape. The only thing that makes that unique is that it happened in 2001 and not in 1988. It must have been his parents’.
By the way, a lot of people’s favorite flows from their faves right now is basic party-rocking flows from the ’80s. The ’80s is back. Like BabyTron — Detroit got the ’80s really right here in our face right now.
Before I went to Samoa, I was listening to Lupe, Hov, De La, Common, P, Dilla. Dilla as a rapper, I’m not gonna do the whole annoying thing right now, but that was a huge thing. Like, I spent a lot of time as a 12-year-old really locking in flow-wise. I’m always gonna fly the flag for the Cool Kids. I feel like Cool Kids and De La, if you squint, it’s a similar space. Now that De La is back on streaming, bro, I’ve been on it heavy. Rappers still can’t rap like that. Like, it’s too free, but structured. It has that impossibleness to it.
By the time of my first tape, I didn’t even have enough time to synthesize all of my influences. You know how Peter Parker first gets bit by the spider and his web is all over the place, he’s gotta get the suit? It was that. I’m finally at the point where I can even hold all of this at once, or be dexterous enough to move within all of it.
But when I was like 15, on my first tape, I was listening to Eminem and Doom. Which is where everyone checks in with me at — everyone’s like, OK, Doom-Eminem guy. Everyone is mad because I don’t say, like, “hazardous” when I rap anymore. [Expletive] is really excited by just one-for-one-ing four-syllable words. It’s a good party rap trick. But that’s easy, you know what I mean?
A thing that has kept me healthy is never being xenophobic about the Brits. I’ve been listening to British rappers the whole time. I think you dust yourself if you don’t. They are really, really, really, really, really good at rapping. They got the freedom of like some dancehall, bro. A lot of where it will be hanging off the cliff’s edge of a beat. That’s what I love about them though — you can go to a new place if you let yourself go over there. It’s like jazz standards, bro. If you don’t have a valid U.K. flow, then you’re gonna get dusted.
Growing up, I feel like we were the first generation that was familiar with everything but, like, maybe don’t want to listen to it all day. But we’re finally at this point that I used to joke about like five years ago, where little kids don’t know Tupac and that’s not embarrassing. It’s supported.
Every generation of 19-, 20-year-olds is gonna come along and be like, [expletive] what you guys just did, I don’t care about it. Maybe that’s like a natural kind of thing that happens as you stand up as a human being. But learning how to listen to Nas, learning how to listen to these things that even though you want to listen to Lil Wayne all day, your older brother, your uncles are like, this is it right here — that’s important.
And I’m still down for that. From my own experience with committing these passages of song to my memory, I know the utility of being a historian so you can draw lines from that to the new thing and not be lost. And then most importantly not become jaded and not have a in-house fighting thing going on that’s yielded some pretty nasty [expletive].
I was part of that first generation that came on the internet and was like, [expletive] this [expletive]. And then old heads were like, what is y’all little [expletive] talking about? And then having that butting-heads thing unnecessarily, because we gotta work together, you feel me? It’s like being in a house. If the adults only interacted with the adults and the children only interacted with the children, it doesn’t work.
You gotta be around kids. This is what I’m saying about the utility of the multigenerational aspect of this thing. The elders know what happened so they can inform the younger ones on, oh, if you like this, then you should check out this, this and this, so you can see the iterations that came before and you can do something different. And then the young people are here to teach the old people this new dance move.
If there’s one thing that comes through this article, I hope it’s this. I want to clarify for people that’s inspired by what I do. I feel like because of my disposition, the thing that I see some kids take away is like a mood and a vocal timbre. And it’s like, I went to the Samoa boys school, my whole [expletive] was all [expletive] up. Whatever weirdness everyone watched me go through was legitimately genuine for me. That is not a stylistic choice. I wish that I didn’t sound like that.
I hope that what they take away from me is be good at rapping. That’s the thing that I care about. I really don’t [expletive] with being a tortured artist. Being tortured is not tight. Rapping hella good is tight. Pigeonholing me means you can just feign knowledge by being like, oh, he makes sad music. Bro, if you listen to my music, 70% of my music is about being better than you. I am a very competitive rapper.
I feel like I had the world put in my hands and I was like, what the [expletive] is this right here? And so I don’t want you to copy that part. I’m saying if you ever get the world in your hands, be free.
Q-TIP
My sister was best friends with Sweet Tee — she made that record, “It’s My Beat.” So back when I was little-little, I remember hearing them talk about records, like, you heard that Treacherous Three record? I’m like, Treacherous Three, I’m thinking it’s like superheroes.
There was a record store on Linden Boulevard, like, right up from my house — I forget the name of it. I used to go there with no money and just ask him about the records and just to see the records. And he would play them for me. You had hundreds and hundreds of 12-inches that would just start popping up. Back then it was still coming out of the disco culture — “Rapper’s Delight,” Fatback Band, “King Tim III (Personality Jock),” Ronnie Gee, “Raptivity.”
We heard “Rapper’s Delight,” and I’ll never forget Phife calling me like, yo, we can do that! The newness of it left us wide-eyed and inspired and hopeful.
You think about the Treacherous Three, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, the Fearless Four, everybody had a group. So you have all these vocalists trading off. And if you even wanna get geekier about it, it goes back to like the old doo-wop street-corner harmony. Famously Run-DMC obviously took that whole interplay between them two and made it worldwide. And of course we wanted to be like them.
I was a big fan of LL Cool J, Kool Moe Dee, T La Rock, L.A. Sunshine from Treacherous Three. All of the dudes where the vocabulary was just a little extra. Slick Rick was huge — his sound, his tone, his voice and the confidence, you know?
Obviously coming up with the Jungle Brothers and De La Soul and the whole Native Tongues, we were tuned to be a little bit more cerebral. And all of the aforementioned icons got us to that point where we knew that we could cannonball off of the diving board. But I remember us wanting to even go further, to be like some Earth, Wind & Fire or some Parliament-Funkadelic. Like to really try to turn it on its ear, and just let that flag fly.
Our thing was to try to marry the two, the music and the content of the lyrics. And to try to be differentiators even amongst our caper partners. And to our left and to our right, when you would look, there’s N.W.A doing that same thing. The music that Dre was putting with the subject matter fit so perfectly. It was fresh, it was just new and it was exciting to be able to emotionalize the music.
Dre and I speak all the time. That’s my bro. We actually have great musical volleys. Obviously LL. I still speak to the De La guys, of course. I catch Latifah here and there. A good deal of us still keep up. I still speak to Lauryn. It may not be like a full open faucet stream of conversation all the time, but we still keep up. I remember talking to Snoop years ago and he was like, man, when y’all made that “Back in the days in the boulevard,” me and Warren G used to rap y’all [expletive].
I think it was 1991, we were doing a Midwest and South gauntlet with the Geto Boys. We were opening for them — they were huge down there. Probably the two most unlikely groups, right? But we had so much fun, man. We was big fans of them, we was rapping they [expletive] to them and they was rapping our [expletive] back to us. It was just amazing. I remember very early on we had a show with DJ Quik and KRS in Compton, and just seeing all the Bloods, and they was just rocking to “El Segundo” and “Bonita” and it was just like, wow, this is really a unifying music.
Because of the scarcity then, when you got in, you had to be good. To be good was the average. I think that everybody’s grind back then to get on was something that created conduits of empathy amongst us all. So that when we did see each other, we were able to tell each other griot tales of how we all got on. “Y’all too? Even in Houston? Even in Cali? Even in Miami?”
When you’re doing it, you feel like you’re on your own planet, right? But then when people dig it and you start seeing other people draw inspiration from what we did, it let us know that we were onto something and it also made the world a little less scary, if that makes sense.
It’s just a great moment of, for me personally, humility and appreciation, when you see a Digable Planets or Arrested Development, a Pharcyde or Souls of Mischief, the Roots. You could go to Badu, the Fugees. And Dilla, who was the great extender of the parlance and endowed it with his own beautiful traits.
That’s to me what I take a great sense of pride in, that I can see all of these guys go on and do honestly better than what we did and to lay even more tracks for us. And it’s like, “Come on, let’s go.”
50 CENT
I fell in love with hip-hop, but it was only playing for one hour out the week on the radio. My grandmother used to go to church and take a tape recorder and record everything the minister said, and she would play Sunday service to herself again on like, Wednesday. She had all of these Maxell cassette tapes that once you record, you break the little tab off. I had to go get toilet paper and put it in the square and record over what she already had for the church. It was only on for one hour — I had to record it then.
This is back when KRS was out, he made such an impression on my career early on, ’cause creatively, that aggression that was there. I didn’t follow a complete blueprint of what he’d done, and at one point he got so much smarter than the audience that it wasn’t entertaining because it was like learning some [expletive]. It was teaching. That’s where he lost me a little bit. But when he came in the beginning, he had the competitive energy — that was what hip-hop was to me the entire time.
He said, “Manhattan keeps on making it, Brooklyn keeps on taking it/Bronx keeps creating it and Queens keeps on faking it.” And I’m from Queens! I liked it so much. But I didn’t know how I felt about it because of what it said.
If you look at that, then look at what I done at the desperation point where Columbia didn’t understand who I was as an artist. I was approaching the release date and I had to do something. I know I don’t have the momentum or anything. It’s going to not work, and it not working isn’t an option. So “How to Rob” — that’s my version of that energy.
Biggie and Tupac, following that, artists were afraid to say each other’s names. So Nas was saying “20 G bets I’m winning ’em, threats I’m sending ’em/Lex with TV sets the minimum.” It was him describing Jay-Z. “In My Lifetime.” Subliminally talking about each other without actually mentioning each other’s name.
My personality difference from the other artists, I’ve been bumped around more than them the entire journey. On my journey early on, it was rough. Then as the music business was doing it to me too, I kind of didn’t know how to not respond like the pit bull that you have outside in the yard.
Early on, Dre was like, I know what this is, this is N.W.A, it’s just one member. What Dre was telling me was that I don’t have to reach to get the audience to come [expletive] with me. They’ll come to me. But I was like, I need this other thing. I had worked out and I got myself into a good space physically. I needed the female audience to feel like they could fix me.
When I listened to great albums, they’ve had emotional moments. With Biggie, it’s “____ You Tonight” featuring R. Kelly. It would create a tone shift on a rapper’s album more like rapping as the feature on someone else’s R&B song. Like Dre specifically, that record, “21 Questions,” he was like, I don’t know why you want it. I hear it. It’s good, but you don’t need it.
The hardest person you could have a melody on a record was Nate Dogg. Nate Dogg will [expletive] you up! Having Nate was the coolest way to make a record like that still feel really hard, and for you not to question it.
I was creatively in pocket on the first record. But I became a star during the second album. The second album is when I found this new value for myself. I started feeling like a bad bitch.
I’ll tell you something that Michael Jackson taught me. Because he was talking to Chris Tucker, and he was a big fan of the actual music. And he was like, you know what, he has good melodies. Like, the way I would say things in the choruses and stuff like that. And that’s what is allowing it to connect internationally, where English is people’s second language. They only can follow the melody.
I think in general, the culture loves things that are damaged, because it makes the audience feel better about themselves, looking at somebody like, they’re more [expletive] up than I am. It allows parts of the audience to go on a safari. To be close enough to the animals and not actually be in danger.
GUCCI MANE
I remember buying my first $5 cassette tape, 2 Live Crew, from the flea market in Alabama. I was like 6 or 7. I didn’t even know what the music was about, that cover was just so raunchy to me. My mama found the tape and played it on the porch in front of her friends to embarrass me — like, “Look what Radric’s listening to.” But I only bought it for the cover.
I moved to Atlanta when I was 9. My brother was listening to the gritty underground Atlanta stuff, the gritty Memphis stuff, New Orleans, so that’s what I gravitated towards — Kingpin Skinny Pimp, Triple Six Mafia, the Hot Boys and Master P.
By the time I started trying to finance my own first tape, maybe ’99 or 2000, those were the key people I could relate to — B.G., Project Pat. Like, OK, this dude just got out of jail, and everybody in the hood listens to that. I’m going through the same things at the same time.
I didn’t feel like Project Pat was the best rapper, but he made me feel him. I’m like, can’t be Fabolous or Lil Wayne, but I can do this. I was late in the game, but I didn’t have to be scared to try. I was going to spring break in Daytona, and it was the whole summer of Project Pat and Big Tymers. I started doing the stuff they were rapping about — like, I’m going to be the CD that I’m listening to.
That’s really how this started. It wasn’t even a love of hip-hop; I’m a hustler. I’m like, damn, I really don’t want to sell dope all the time. It’s too risky. If Jermaine Dupri can put out Kris Kross, Birdman ain’t really a good rapper and I got a little money — I can get in this.
I was always thinking, none of this matters if I go to the club and I ain’t got no movement. I’d seen rappers try to get their music out, but they looked lame and no one took them seriously. I was like, “How can I get the whole apartments on Bouldercrest to come with me?” I knew I was popular, I was already going to the club, and I leveraged that. It really was calculated.
My first album came out in 2005. I think 50 Cent dropped his in 2003. He was just super hot. The same stuff he was talking about, I was really having those beefs. It ain’t even nothing to glorify, but that’s what was going on for me, for real. That was my soundtrack, and it really emboldened me to talk with urgency about the stuff I’m doing.
That was at a time when I was heavily in the streets, and I was heavily paranoid about what I had did. I was riding back and forth to Alabama trapping and I had two CDs — Lil Jon’s CD, “Kings of Crunk,” and “Get Rich or Die Tryin’.” That was my inspiration: “I just have to get past this stage.” I moved fully back to Atlanta in 2004, and maybe two weeks later, I made “Black Tee.”
Gucci in ’06, I just was whoever I was 24/7, a lot of times to my detriment. But that’s who I was as a 26-year-old guy trying to be an artist, one foot in and one foot out. My peak came later because I was locked up. But the business was in a better place when I got out, and I benefited from that.
People would never think that a rapper in his 40s would be as in demand. But I’m making way more money than I thought. I never could travel until I was 37, 38 years old. I’m glad I don’t have to do a show in the hood all the time, like I was doing. I know the chitlin circuit. I’m so glad I got over a lot of hurdles, where now I can do a show internationally and get the type of money I felt like I deserved.
Being in Iceland was definitely one of those moments. I had a concert at a festival. The sun didn’t even go down the whole day. That was the craziest thing I’ve ever seen — and it was fun. I never would have thought that it would be something I’d like. I used to tell people, “I don’t want to go nowhere but East Atlanta and right back to the studio.” But damn, it was way better than sitting in that cell.
DJ HOLLYWOOD
The beginnings of what hip-hop is was called non-syncopated rap, meaning that they had a lot of rap, but people weren’t doing it to the track. They had a jazz beat going or some kind of miscellaneous beat that didn’t drive the words. Whatever they were talking about, it had to be really, really tight and interesting, or nobody wouldn’t listen to it. So some of these cats was like the Last Poets, Rudy Ray Moore, Blowfly, Jocko Henderson, Pigmeat Markham, Oscar Brown Jr., Hank Spann. A turntable wasn’t involved.
When the turntable became involved is basically where I step in and started adding the lyrics to a record. I got my first job in ’71. Once I got the mixer with the headphones, it changed the game.
Records back in the day, there was an A section, a B section and a break. I’m the voice. And then I get my voice out right in time for the guy that starts singing. As long as I’m complementing the music, I’m in it. Not only did you get the great record, but you got the great introduction to the record as it came on, you know?
I was a singer before this all happened. I began to sing everything I said — “If I was snow, I would be cold/If I was a jug of wine, I would be old” — and that’s what made it harmonious.
I didn’t call it rapping. I was just entertaining. It was new, it was fresh. A lot of people was like, “Yo, could somebody tell this [expletive] to shut up. Let the record play!” I went through the wire with this. It wasn’t all sweet. But I managed to stand my ground.
After the blackout in ’77, everybody and they mama had some equipment — microphones and turntables and stuff — and they all started to get into the game. I had the blueprint of what a person should be doing, and mostly everybody, they were sounding just like me. A lot of the guys were using my same lines to get their thing on, you know what I mean?
I’m the creator of the style. I’m the creator of the colorful words over music to make people enjoy themselves. Because the first raps was about enjoying yourself. Then it got political and then it got to your neighborhood, then it got to the stickup man and then it got to the sexy, all that came after. But at the beginning, it was basically just to have a good time.
I saw people putting out records, but what they’re doing is slightly different. But I had a big head. Like, get out the way — this is Hollywood!
I was high. I was a lunatic for a while. When you high, you don’t give a [expletive] about nothing. And that’s how I got left behind. ’Cause I was fired up and then being fired up inside my head, like there’s nothing better than me. I’m not ashamed. That’s what happened and that’s how it went.
I was high for a long time. I was high in the ’80s, too. I was on cocaine at first and then I moved to the crack. I can’t blame what happened on anybody other than me. Don’t have a soul in the world that I can say, man, y’all didn’t do me right, y’all didn’t look out for me. And I know plenty of people that could have, plenty of people that should have.
I didn’t make the money that they’re making now, but at the time I was making more money than anybody. I had limousines, I had my own Cadillac. I was doing very well, but I was getting high at the same time, so I was spending my money frivolously.
Everything that I ever owned, it just went. I lost the apartment, so all the stuff that I accumulated there is gone. And I did that over and over and over.
The whole 50 years of hip-hop that they’re promoting right now, it’s not about dudes from where I’m at. It’s for dudes from the ’80s. I look around, man, there’s 7,000 legends. Where’d they come from? How? What did you do to be a legend? This little period of 50 years of hip-hop and they’re honoring it, if it goes past and I get nothing out of it, then I don’t know what to do from there.
I can’t beat myself up. I got clean toward the ’90s. All I want to do is find me a spot where they let me play. I’m trying to see right now how I can change my life from here. The whining, I ain’t never do that. Me cracking myself over the head, I’m not going to do that. I’m sorry I didn’t catch on, but I mean, it wasn’t no thing to me. I really didn’t have that period where I was so sad that it wasn’t me. Because I’m in all of them. I’m in their DNA.
MC LYTE
In Spanish Harlem, where my grandmother lived, my older cousins were playing cassette tapes: the Cold Crush Brothers, Funky 4 + 1, Sha-Rock, Treacherous Three, Sugarhill Gang, Kurtis Blow. I remember one of my cousins used to date his brother, and that was a big deal.
The Sequence was definitely an influence to hear — Angie B, Blondy and Cheryl, how they all attack, like very differently from one another, but were laid back with it. That laid-back way became a part of the way that I stepped to a microphone. And of course, Salt-N-Pepa, they definitely were a guiding force for me. I learned all of the words to their records as I began to practice for who it is that I was going to become.
Run-DMC, Melle Mel — the message of “The Message” really helped me. I was already writing stories, because my mother insisted I write essays for everything. So to be able to hear about this place that I had never been. I had never been to the Bronx. I was just Brooklyn and Manhattan. As far as I knew, 138th Street was the last stop on the train.
I never considered myself a rapper. I was an MC, and an MC, to me, is very different from a rapper. Like an MC is, you know, Nas, versus someone who is not an MC, but had a rap record, and that would be Hammer. He wasn’t in there to show his skills off as an MC, he was in there to make a hit song. Just because you rap doesn’t make you a rapper. But that’s just me.
I happen to like a lot of what the female MCs are doing now, and I listen to everything — I’m a DJ. I’m not just an ’80s, ’90s DJ. I like “Plan B” by Megan Thee Stallion. I like Megan’s register. I’m a fan of Remy Ma. The way that she rhymes, she makes you feel it, just like Lil’ Kim. Just like Foxy. Foxy, Lil’ Kim and myself, we’re all from Brooklyn.
I like this new one by Coi Leray, where she uses that “Message” sample. I like Latto when she used Mariah’s sample. It just feels like a return to something heavy and loaded, and I like when I can feel the depth in someone’s voice.
I’m a fan of Rapsody. I love what she talks about. Just the awareness and acknowledgment of love and womanhood and Blackness. Tierra Whack. Nobody’s messing with that freestyle, she’s just bananas with it. And of course, Cardi and Nicki. Baby Tate. It’s like so many MCs on the scene. Lady London. Oh my goodness, she brings it. You’re talking about college-educated, and not afraid to flip some words on you that you got to go look up.
No one rolled over and started rapping by themselves. Everybody was inspired by somebody. Whether they want to come clean about that or not is a different situation.
LIL WAYNE
The New Orleans hip-hop scene was way more captivating than the worldwide hip-hop scene, because it was more in your face. Our local radio stations, they favored our artists, so our Top 10 songs would always be full of New Orleans. You’d probably get a Billboard No. 1 hip-hop song thrown in there at, like, No. 8.
Our block parties were a bit different; they were more like a concert. There’s a big crowd, there’s a DJ and there’s a microphone, but it’s not for the DJ. The DJ would introduce the artist coming on, and it was up to that artist to keep the party going.
All these names are a chain link to me getting a deal: This first artist, his name was Roni. Roni was one of the best. He reminded me of Juvenile a lot. His niche was finding a way to tell you exactly what he’s doing every day — walking to the damn corner store — and he found a way to make you love it, feel like you could relate to it, like you just took that same walk. He’d go through his day and people would love it.
You could get a recorded tape of that whole block party, sold after it was over. I would only want to hear Roni’s part, backwards and forwards, over and over and over. He was from my hood, but he was a grown-ass man, so he didn’t know too much about me.
From the other side of my hood, there was another guy named Lil Slim and he was a bit different. He talked about the hood, and the hood only. I meshed those two guys together, and I couldn’t wait to get my opportunity.
I was every bit of 9, 8 years old. Thank God I was always a smart kid in school, so I was interested in words, always interested in words. Never knew why; I still don’t. I always was the main person in the play. Whatever it was, from “Les Miserables” to “Wizard of Oz.” I want the main role. I couldn’t wait till the day that damn DJ gave me the mic. It was over.
I was probably around 10, 11 when they had the station called the Box. People were ordering videos, so you had to watch 1,000 videos you don’t want to watch, but once or twice you’ll see something on there that you didn’t know too much about. That was my real introduction to being actually interested in other music other than New Orleans music.
I fell in love with New York artists, anybody from the East Coast. They was making more of their words to me. You had people like Q-Tip and Busta, way before the “Gimme Some More” swag — just a backpack, big old jacket on, spitting. I was interested in artists that took on a character. The reason why I don’t read comic books or watch cartoons or believe in superheroes like my other friends was because I’m getting the same thrill out of hip-hop.
I fell in love with Onyx, because I believed they woke up in the morning screaming at each other. And still my favorite artist, Missy Elliott. You know when you’re watching a sport and you’re like, this person is just too cold, too damn good and they can do whatever they want? She was that person to me.
Before there was Drake and people who were rapping and singing, Missy was doing that. That captivated me, and I was moved by that. It made me want to do it. That’s why I loved Drake when I met Drake. If you’re around me, you know for a fact that if you’ve got a little harmony, a little melody in your voice, I’m about to make you sing.
To me, Shawn Carter, Jay-Z, was the god of words. He could’ve rewritten English books. I was introduced to Jay by listening to Biggie. “Lucky Me,” from “In My Lifetime, Vol. 1,” I learned backward and forward. I put it in songs, and I actually start off every show, still, saying words from that song: “And I swear to everything when I leave this earth/it’s gon’ be on both feet, never knees in the dirt/you could try me, [expletive]/but when I squeeze it hurts/fine …” And what’s crazy is we stop the music on that part and the crowd sings the rest of it with me as if I wrote that. But that’s all Jay.
When it comes to B.G., he’s very significant, very specific, because we put songs together -together. That was back when I actually put words on paper. I know exactly his writing style, his technique. It’s impossible for some of that not to rub off on you. But I don’t write anymore.
I was probably about 16, 17 — this is before internet and all that — when I heard a nugget that Jay wasn’t writing. And I didn’t want to ever see a pen or paper again in my life. Jay was my Bible.
Back then, whoever the star was, they would always take on this young protégé. I would always look to that person. When Jay did it, I would look to Bleek. If I’m listening to Puff, I would look to Mase, or I would look for Jada. It was the humility of the big dog to set up a path for the next person to be bigger. And so that’s why I made sure when I got the chance, I was going to run with it.
Nicki Minaj was always into my wording technique, the way I come up with the verse. “Why?” “But why?” “OK, but why?” She’s that kid. She was set on, “I’m the female Weezy.” Nick would change her voice like me, she would actually sound like me sometimes.
Drizzy’s just Drizzy. That “good boy, bad boy, I was on the TV show, but I wish you would play with me” type of stuff.
I was scared, actually, when I called Eminem for a song. That is a monster. He must have the same thing I have with words. Like, we can’t get them out of our heads. Every meaning, every aspect of them. Things that rhyme, we hear it. I already know the gift and the curse that he has. And I love to hear the way he puts it together.
When I was on “The Tonight Show,” I was playing Pictionary. And my thing was Harry Potter. So I drew a pot, and they got that. I drew a man with a face, and I put a bunch of hair around him. They were like, “Wait, he’s hairy.” I’m, like, Harry Potter . We plan our words. At all times.
AZEALIA BANKS
I’ve made a special contribution to hip-hop, and I feel like that gets overlooked a lot of times. Hip-hop is Black culture. People say, “Oh, you make house music, aka white people music.” I’m like, honey, no. House music is Black music. Everything I do is in the spirit of hip-hop.
My first memory of hip-hop, even though I had no clue what was going on, was O.D.B. on Mariah Carey’s “Fantasy” remix. I was like 2, going on 3. And Lil’ Kim’s verse on “All About the Benjamins.” The audacity was just so fab. I remember the video with the fisheye lens, the see-through dress and the blonde wig. And she started off with: “What the bloodclaat?/Wanna bumble with the bee, huh?/Throw a hex on the whole family.” I didn’t know what a hex was until I was maybe 16, but I could spit that [expletive] word for word.
I was a theater kid, and Lil Wayne, for sure, was like a thespian. It was theatrical and the jokes were funny . “Cannon” is probably one of the best Lil Wayne verses ever. [Raps “Cannon” for 30 seconds]
But my favorite rapper of all time is Styles P, from hearing the Lox at block parties. Then we had the DatPiff era, so I would download like, “Ghost in the Machine.” I just like how unrehearsed he is. And the swag. He was talking to you rather than trying to create a fantastical world.
We actually have a song together on my first mixtape. He did it for free. I’ve done collabs with other male rappers that will probably never see the light of day because I wouldn’t sign their record deal. Like, damn, Yeezy — I loved you my entire life and that’s what you do?
I started rapping because I had this boyfriend who rapped and they would do these cyphers. If your bars were wack, they would, like, snatch the blunt from you, you know? I skipped the cypher for like two weeks and I came back with a vengeance. I had to learn all these different words for “firearm.” I wrote “Seventeen” over that Ladytron beat and when they passed me the blunt that day, I came out with: “I’m not the don diva/I’m beyond ya don skeezers/I get cake from quick chicks with long heaters.” They was like, “Ohhhhhh. Shorty, you can rap! You should record that!”
The very first record that I ever recorded was into a microphone in a sock in this guy’s closet, in between all these Supreme jackets. Two weeks later, I was featured on the Fader blog. I blew up overnight and then it was just kind of like, OK, I have a job to do now.
I think that all of that theatrical training definitely helped. When it came to “212,” that white girl Valley Girl voice, I was really just making fun of dumb bitches who come to New York for like two years and are like, I’m a New Yorker !
I think that everyone at XL Recordings forgot that I was 17. I felt like there was no mentorship. Everybody just kind of abandoned me and expected me to know what they wanted.
At the same time, they had just signed Odd Future, who were super, super duper crass. I won’t lie — I was so jealous just watching them put all this love into Odd Future. Just to see them be given the support to be kids. It’s a classic tale of boys can do whatever they want, but girls need to be like, prim and proper. I sent “212” in to XL and they dropped me. It was 100% a bunch of misogynoir.
I was thinking maybe I should go get a GED and go to college. Then I just get this phone call from Nick Grimshaw on BBC Radio 1, and he’s played it like a million times. I didn’t even know what BBC Radio 1 was. And then very quickly you go from getting paid $150 and a bottle of Smirnoff to perform to getting like, 5,000 euros at some weird charity event. I’d never had 5,000 anything all at once in my hands, ever. All I could think was, I’m going to get a weave and a laptop.
One thing leads to another, and then I’m at Karl Lagerfeld’s house. I didn’t even know who Karl Lagerfeld was when he invited me to perform at his house in Paris. I didn’t know what Coachella was when I got booked for Coachella. That Coachella date in 2012, it was like, all right, I’m here. I’m a star.
Jimmy Iovine, the very first day I met him, he said to me, “The best thing you can do for a woman is get the [expletive] out of her way.” He actually bought me my first, like, three pairs of Louboutins, my first Chanel bag, my first real bottle of perfume. He was always a gentleman and he always thought my jokes were funny.
“212” was such an anomaly that no one has been able to successfully build upon it outside of me. What I see is people doing an Azealia Banks impression, and that is partially due to just the belief that a woman couldn’t be the mastermind behind the sound, the aesthetic, the everything. I’m still alive, girls.
There’s no magic in hip-hop now. Hip-hop has been taken from us and used as a weapon against us. No one is talking about anything. Just for the record: All these little new rap girls — they really suck.
LIL B
In 2003, I wrote a book report in middle school that was about hip-hop. That’s as real as it gets, man. From a middle-school me: “Hip-hop to me is an art form, a style, a genre, an influence and a lifestyle. It’s a different type of music style that does not sound like any other type of music. It’s like a baggy, nice, shiny type of clothing.”
I’m walking the beach right now, and I’ve also got an article that I tore out of XXL magazine in 2005, about when Lil Wayne performed at Club Speed, Dec. 19, 2004. It’s hilarious because you’re talking about 500-plus attendees. Now obviously Wayne can do stadiums. That’s my early motivation. Ain’t it crazy later I made the XXL freshmen list? These papers I’ve saved have been through fires. It’s very, very personal to me.
Gucci Mane, Lil Wayne, you know, they set the bar. They set the bar still to this day. It was so much inspiration out here in the Bay, too, from E-40, Too Short, Mistah F.A.B., Turf Talk, Keak da Sneak, listening to 106 [KMEL], listening to Wild 94.9. I feel like I really seen it from a unique perspective.
You’ve got to realize, there was a time where I was the only one doing what I was doing. I was outside at a time when people were saying music was dead, and I was still pushing. It hurt my heart when Nas said hip-hop was dead, and I made it my mission to make sure hip-hop stayed alive. This was before the iPhone.
Just hearing my mom and my dad say they’re proud of me, knowing they have seen me do my thing independently, unsigned. It’s 40, Short, Master P and myself, Brandon McCartney. We did the Jive Records thing with the Pack. I’ve been doing my own thing ever since. I’ve been managing Lil B.
Soulja Boy is a real legend and an inspiration, a pioneer with the music, early on YouTube. He was really at the anime store back then, you know what I’m saying? He don’t get no credit for that. It’s a lot of hype around anime now, but he was going to the store early.
I always looked at myself as giving out swag. I say that humbly. There’s people that have the fire that I see. I appreciate Lil Yachty — he was always holding it down and then taking his career to a whole ’nother level, showing me what’s possible, doing Sprite deals. Future, Tyler, the Creator. Chief Keef — I was changing the game with the music video stuff on YouTube and then he took it the next level. Now I could be influenced off Playboi Carti, you know what I’m saying? And Young Thug took it to the next level.
I’ve still got a lot of homework to do with this hip-hop, right? I need to do my homework on De La Soul. I need to do my homework on Slum Village. I’ve got to really do my Public Enemy homework, you know? What’s the gentleman’s name — MC Serch and his group? A little bit of Beastie Boys homework. It’s so many beautiful people that’s added to this genre and to the culture.
E-40
I call myself the greatest game-spitter of all time. A game-spitter is somebody that spit that slang, the street [expletive], all angles. I might touch down on a pimp. I might touch down on being over the stove, twisting the pot counterclockwise, serving the dope wet. I might talk about when a guy about to get jacked, or about to pull a lick, or when he’s going to get his head tore off, you know? It was whole ’nother angle of the game that the Bay Area was on back then.
I was the first rapper talking about zippers — calling ounces “zippers,” that’s 28 grams. I was the first one calling them “units.” I was the first rapper screaming “choppers” — it came from Chicago, from Al Capone. I could document all that. Everybody’s saying “slaps” — I brought that to the rap game. It came from me, Earl Stevens, E-40, hands down.
So many things didn’t come out of my brain; it came from the streets. When rappers are from the urban community, they talk about their surroundings and what they done picked up here and there — in the pen, wherever they at. That’s me.
In Oakland in the ’80s, the local D-boy would have enough gouda to shoot Too Short some money — it could’ve been $500, it could’ve been a thou-wow — to make a song just about them. Calvin T and Magic Mike, from Richmond, Calif., they were doing the same thing. These are local songs circulating through dubbed tapes. They were a big influence on me.
And Ice-T. He was speaking a language that most of us was living. People don’t give him enough credit. We have a mutual love and respect for each other because game recognize game. He seen my whole hustle in the underground, selling tapes out the trunk of a car.
I was a rapper that invested in myself. We was doing this when Moby Dick was a goldfish. A&Rs didn’t get what we was talking about. A lot of times it would go over their head like a flying saucer, you know what I’m saying? That’s just the same as out there with 8Ball & MJG, Master P. Everybody was doing it independently. When we did independent music we did it by force, not by choice. I signed my distribution deal with Jive Records in 1994. The whole Bay Area followed my blueprint after that.
When I came out with “Ghetto Report Card,” I was 37, 38 years old. My whole career was just revived. It was amazing. I was part of the crunk movement and the hyphy movement at the same time. “U and Dat,” “Snap Yo Fingers” and so on. We had the South and the West Coast.
Imagine if there was streaming back then when we had “Tell Me When to Go,” “Bitch,” “Choices.” We would be diamond on each one of those records. I put new life into the West Coast in 2006. And that’s no ifs, ands or buts. Can’t nobody say I didn’t, with the help of Lil Jon. And it’s never stopped since then.
That’s my role — they call me the Ambassador of the Bay. And I don’t know nobody else there that represents it like me.
EMINEM
My Uncle Ronnie had the “Breakin’” soundtrack. I was, like, 11 years old, and he played me Ice-T’s “Reckless” before I’d seen the movie. Uncle Ronnie used to breakdance and he taught me a little bit, showing me some moves. From that moment I knew there was nothing else — no other kind of music that I would ever like again — aside from rap.
We used to bounce back and forth from Missouri, and shortly after that we moved to Detroit, and we were staying at my Grandma Nan’s house. I had a tape player, and I found WJLB. There was this DJ named the Wizard. He would play from, like, 10 to 11. I would just hit record on my tape and I’d go to sleep and get up for school to see what I got: “Go See the Doctor,” Kool Moe Dee, UTFO. I just wanted everything — give me everything that rap has: Run-DMC, Fat Boys, LL.
Every time LL dropped something it was, like, he was the best, no one’s touching him. LL Cool J was everything to everybody. You know, I always wanted a Kangol.
My first rap, I was 12-ish, when LL Cool J, “Bad,” came out. I would be, like, just walking around my Aunt Edna’s house, thinking of rhymes and writing thoughts down. It was a complete LL bite, but it was something that I dabbled in. I would be sitting in school sometimes and a line would hit me.
And then Run-DMC would drop a new album and you’d be, like, “This is the craziest [expletive] I’ve ever heard.” “Yo, this is as good as rap can get, lyrically.” And then Rakim changed the way people thought about rap.
It just kept advancing to the next level. I was there to watch its conception and its growth. Everybody was trying to one-up each other. It went from rhyming one- or two-syllable words to rhyming four and five and six. Then Kool G Rap came along and he would rhyme seven, eight, nine, 10.
But I was a sponge. I would gravitate towards the compound-syllable rhyming, like the Juice Crew. Lord Finesse, to Kool G Rap, to Big Daddy Kane, to Masta Ace, Redman, Special Ed. I don’t even think I understood why I liked it. I had a couple of friends that had to point out to me how many syllables somebody was rhyming.
And then Treach from Naughty by Nature came along and he was doing all that, too. He was cool, too — his image and everything. I wanted to be him. When the first Naughty by Nature album dropped, that whole summer, I couldn’t write a rap. “I’ll never be that good; I should just quit.” I was so depressed, but that’s all I played for that summer. Proof thought Treach was the best rapper, too. Every time he would drop an album I would just be, like, Son of a bitch.
Nas, too. I remember The Source gave “Illmatic” five mics. I already knew I liked Nas from “Live at the Barbeque” with Main Source, because his verse on that is one of the most classic verses in hip-hop of all time. But I was, like, “Five mics, though? Let me see what this is.”
And when I put it on, “And be prosperous/though we live dangerous/Cops could just arrest me/Blamin’ us/We’re held like hostages.” He was going in and outside of the rhyme scheme, internal rhymes. That album had me in a slump, too. I know the album front to back.
There was three or four years, maybe, where I kind of dipped out of listening to rap. I was so on the grind in the underground. I didn’t have money to buy any tapes. Every dollar, every dime that I had went to either studio time or to buy Hailie diapers.
Tuesday night I would go to the Ebony Showcase on Seven Mile. Wednesday night would be Alvin’s. Friday night would be Saint Andrew’s. And then Saturday would be the Hip Hop Shop.
Proof was hosting open mics at the Hip Hop Shop, and they started having battles. The first one that I got in — it was actually the first battle there — I won. And then the second battle, I won it again. I realized maybe I should try to go out of state. So I would hop in the car with friends and drive down to Cincinnati for the Scribble Jam.
Back then, you had to go off the top of the head. If you didn’t you’d get booed offstage. So I learned from watching Proof that you can freestyle, but just have a couple lines in the back of your head, a couple of punchlines you know you want to use, and then freestyle around that.
Coming up in the battle scene was the greatest thing to happen to me because I knew what lines were going to get a reaction from the crowd. That’s what I would focus on. So when I got signed with Dre, I was trying to translate that to record, to get that reaction. I would picture the listener sitting there and what lines they might react to. I just used that as a formula. Like, “How you gonna breastfeed, Mom?/You ain’t got no tits.”
When the first Onyx album dropped, Sticky Fingaz was so great at saying that kind of [expletive]: “I’m thinking about taking my own life/I might as well, except they might not sell weed in hell.” And Bizarre was really great at that. If we reacted to it, then we thought other people would, too. That shaped my whole career, you know?
BUN B
When I was young, I was immersing myself in the music, but I don’t actually want to become an MC until “Microphone Fiend.” And this is after I fall in love with the Juice Crew — Kool G Rap, Big Daddy Kane became huge influences on me. I’m writing rhymes at this time. The “Microphone Fiend” video comes on “Rap City,” and that’s when I decide I really want to be a rapper, ’cause this is the coolest [expletive] I’ve ever seen in my life, and I really want to be seen as this cool.
You don’t really start hearing Houston hip-hop until KTSU starts playing it. That’s the radio station for Texas Southern University. There were guys like R.P. Cola, Billy Dee, these were the guys that were actually in the clubs having freestyle battles. Around that same time as Akshen, but that’s still very under the radar. “Another Head Put to Rest,” that’s not playing on the radio. It’s too much cursing. You hear “Car Freak” and stuff like that, but it really doesn’t come together until the Geto Boys “Balls and My Word.” That’s when the idea of making music and putting it out was not as far-fetched as it seemed.
I start writing about ’88. Juice Crew, Rakim, that’s the technical level at which I’m aspiring to operate. The use of metaphors, manipulating the English language, rhyming mid-word, putting together as many similar-sounding words as possible. And I feel like I should be pretty good at it because I’m pretty good at school, right? I make really good grades in English. I know more words than most of my friends. I should be able to figure out how to incorporate some of that into rhymes. I tried it initially, it was terrible. Like [expletive] would’ve had to literally sit down and get a dictionary. And people don’t really want to do that.
A lot of this realization is Pimp’s influence on me. He was like, man, this [expletive] gotta jam. People gotta be able to see theyself when they see you and hear theyself when they hear you. If you want to be good on a technical level and compare your rhymes to rocket ships and cellular biology or molecular biology or whatever, that’s cool. But at the end of the day, people gotta dance to that [expletive].
When we first started putting out music, I say there might have been 50 rappers in all of Houston at the time. But when we first went to New York in ’92 to sign with Jive, the first three white people we met in New York were rappers. Like the bellman: “So what are you guys doing here? You rap? Oh man, I’m a rapper!” Pizza guy: “You’re here to sign a record deal? Put me on, I’m a rapper.” The driver the next day: “You guys rap, I guess? You’re going to the Jive building. I do a little something-something.” And all of these guys white! The weed guy was like, “You guys are rappers? I rap too.” And he was white as well.
In the earliest years of my career, I wanted to try to vocalize how hard I felt I was and how tough I felt I was. I eventually realized it was not about being the hardest, it was really about being just hard enough and being able to be enough of what was needed in that room at that time.
So if I’m in a room with a bunch of Ruthless Records [expletive], there’s a certain way I gotta move and carry myself, but eventually when I get to the mic, everybody understands who we are. Same thing would happen if I would’ve ended up in a room with Q-Tip and Busta in ’92. There’s certain assumptions that people are gonna draw about each other. And when I actually show my talent, that’s the unifying point.
I was fascinated by wordplay and that was the dominant style of music coming from the East Coast. But then I’m also from a very small town. There’s a lot of gangster [expletive] going on in my town. Crack is coming into the city. And so I know that if I rap, I also have to be a reflection of that.
At one point I hear this song, Volume 10’s “Pistolgrip-Pump,” which sonically sounds nothing like us, much less anything at the time. The beat was dope. Then I hit the hook and I’m like, wait a minute, that’s me. It’s from one of my lines in “Pocket Full of Stones.” I never asked for a dime. I didn’t think that rappers charged other rappers. When I heard it, I was more like, damn, they know my [expletive] on the West Coast! And then he gets on another record and is like, “‘Pistolgrip’ was a hit!/UGK, I’d like to say what’s up.” I’m like, this is crazy!
We met Biggie in ’94. We’re on promo with Jive Records, and this is literally within three to five days of Craig Mack’s “Flava in Ya Ear” going gold. So we’re there, Craig’s there, Big’s there, and everybody’s really fawning over Craig Mack. But obviously we wanted to meet Biggie.
We go over and we introduce ourselves and he’s like, “I know who y’all are. Y’all are on the ‘Menace’ soundtrack. Y’all got the ‘Pockets’ joint — I was out there with Eiht, I told him y’all got the best record on the soundtrack.”
We were very flattered and taken aback at that. And keep in mind, this is when we’re in possession of the bootleg from Biggie, but I’m trying not to allude to that. I don’t know how he might receive it.
We had weed, we offered to smoke with him. So we go out to the car to smoke and I offer him the front seat and he’s like, nah, I’m gonna sit in the back if that’s OK. And he never closes the door on the car. I’m trying to hotbox, right? I’m trying to get the doors closed, get the windows up, but he’s not going for it. And come to find out, ’cause he didn’t really know us like that, he didn’t want to sit in the front seat ’cause he didn’t want dudes he didn’t know behind him. And he needed the door open because he would need a little bit of a head start if he needed to make a quick getaway.
KOOL KEITH
I was a popular dancer in high school and I saw rap from the B-boy stance when rap was being plugged up into the streetlights. When I was going to school, the Cold Crush Brothers were going to school with me. It wasn’t until the mid-80s that I started rapping, which turned into Ultramagnetic MCs.
I met Ced Gee when we were going to high school together and we formed the group. We listened to the Treacherous Three, who would use a lot of big words in their raps. They were using words nobody was using. We looked at the Treacherous Three like, This is the point of hip-hop. I want to rhyme like this. I don’t want to do the “Yes, yes y’all, ya don’t stop the body rock!” They put pen to paper. Now rap was about vocabulary. It was no longer baby rhymes.
T La Rock was one of the most high-tech rappers at that time with the technical words. I was hanging with Greg Nice. We had a chance to see everybody from the super old-school acts all the way up to Spoonie Gee, Run-DMC and Whodini. They were all out with records before we even had a deal.
At the time there was a craze happening where everyone was using TV-show themes. So we waited for that craze to go by and that’s when rap started going heavy with the samples. It became MC Shan, Eric B. & Rakim and then Ultra. So when “Ego Trippin’” came out, that was like the third record that shocked everybody like, Wow, this is different!
We pressed up 500 copies of “Ego Trippin’.” We hit Red Alert off, and I delivered the records straight to Marley Marl’s house. I remember Big Daddy Kane was in the kitchen. That’s where Marley had his mic set up.
Marley was really open to it. He spun it on WBLS. And then I gave Chuck Chillout a copy in person. I remember me and Funkmaster Flex used to talk in his car about different rappers.
To be honest, a lot of rappers were jealous of Ultramagnetic MCs, but when “Ego Trippin’” came out, there was nothing you could do because every car had it playing up and down the block. You would hear it in every project. All you would hear is “MC’s Ultra! MC’s Ultra!” everywhere you went. I would go through the projects and people would scream and we didn’t even have a video out. I wasn’t popular on TV. I don’t know how people had a vision of knowing a person without even seeing them on social media, on Instagram. Back then it was more about the flyers and posters and people seeing you on a show with Boogie Down Productions.
If you listen to the second verse of “Ego Trippin’,” I was just making the words fit on a beat. I wasn’t trying to rhyme: “Through the scientific matter I probe for evidence/Leading melodies obtaining slight positive beams/Of the average formulation, apply mechanically.” And people didn’t even know what I was doing because the first verse of the record was more straight rap. The beat was so hot and the chorus was so dramatic that you didn’t even realize the second verse didn’t rhyme.
At that time, I liked Lakim Shabazz. I liked Latee’s “This Cut’s Got Flavor” and stuff like that. But once we were out, I tried not to follow rap in a lyrical way because I thought that if I listened to everybody’s rhymes a lot, I wouldn’t have my own originality. I used to buy funk records like Con Funk Shun because I was a dancer. I bought Undisputed Truth and Cameo. My main inspiration was Slave. That’s why Ultra’s music was like that. I didn’t grow up on jazz. I didn’t know about Ron Carter or Ronnie Laws.
When I started the Dr. Octagon project, I had so much material piled up that I had to break it up into different characters. People thought I was just being weird, but I was being a businessman. A lot of artists were stuck as just one person. They had to do a record deal with that same style again. But I had a lot of ideas. I think that’s why Parliament-Funkadelic opened my mind up. They had Brides of Funkenstein, they had Sir Nose, Funkadelic and Parliament. George Clinton broke his group up into so many different parts. So that’s what I felt like: a one-person Parliament-Funkadelic.
During that time, I tended to like the peculiar people. I liked the artists that had flows, like Fiend and Mac from No Limit. But a lot of the rappers couldn’t adapt to different sounds. That made me feel like, OK, I’m going to create a Dr. Octagon. I’m going to create a Dr. Dooom. I’m going to create a Black Elvis. But all of those characters are part of me.
KRAYZIE BONE
My first memory of hip-hop was when my older brother brought home the LL Cool J “Radio” tape. I remember him coming in the house and he threw the tape on the bed and was like, “You don’t know nothing about this.” And I put the tape into the radio and I never took it out. Never took it out, you know what I’m saying? I was like 12, 13. That’s what made me start writing my own raps, because I wanted to learn LL Cool J’s songs. I loved “You’ll Rock.” I still bump that to this day. The beat was hard, the lyrical flow — LL was before his time on that.
So I started writing down his lyrics and I saw the blueprint on how to write a rhyme. I wrote my own one day and I never stopped. All the songs I liked that I wanted to learn, I would write the lyrics down. I liked the continuous flow, like Big Daddy Kane and Biz Markie, Dana Dane and Slick Rick. We never liked when rappers would flow and they would pause and then they would go back.
The Bone Thugs style developed by just basically being in cyphers together. We would smoke weed either in my mother’s basement or at whoever’s house we was at, and we’d just start rhyming, working on our harmonies and everything. We knew each other and we knew we could rhyme but when the other four would say the ad-libs, it would sound like we was harmonizing. It’s nothing we did on purpose — we just started doing it and that was our style one day. We didn’t even know what we had until we would rap for people and they’d be like, “Y’all sound like the rapping Temptations or something.” Then when we got with Eazy-E, he would tell us, “This style is different. Y’all singing like singers, too.”
Before hip-hop, I was a Michael Jackson fanatic. I was a New Edition fanatic. R&B, that’s all my parents played. So I know about all the old-school R&B like the Isley Brothers. We just started mixing in some of those flows. If you listen to “1st of tha Month” and “Days of Our Livez,” we just started picking old-school songs and putting our harmonies to it.
Singers liked what we were doing. When our management got a call about Mariah Carey wanting to do a record with us, at the time, we didn’t even really understand how big Mariah Carey was. We knew of her, but we were so wrapped up in our newfound fame, we were just in our own little world. So, like, we almost didn’t even go. We was on the plane contemplating, about to get off the plane, but something just made us stay on the plane.
When we got there, she said basically she loved our style. She loved our flow, how different it was. I’m glad we didn’t get off the plane.
We also got love from Bobby Womack when he was alive. I got a chance to meet his daughters and they told me, “Yo, my father loved y’all music. He played y’all music all the time. He turned us on to y’all.” That really shocked me. I was like, Wow, the O.G. It made me feel good because I came up loving his music. It was cool to tell my parents, like, “Hey, guess who listens to Bone? Bobby Womack.” My pops was like, “What?!’” He loved that.
FABO
We came up off Michael Jackson, my mama listening to James Brown, my grandpa was really into Curtis Mayfield, my uncle listening to Run-DMC, New Edition. We were singers — I came up in the era where you were still going out there trying to sing to the girl to catch her, you know?
My very first memory of hip-hop was sitting down with my brother, rewinding Bone Thugs-n-Harmony trying to learn “1st of tha Month”: “Wake up, wake up, wake up.” That was when it really hit me, like, this is what I want to do.
I’m from Bankhead, so I seen Kilo, the dope boy in the neighborhood who had made it, in his money-green Cadillac all the time. And I came in the rap game up under Raheem the Dream. These was our local heroes. They mean everything. That was our inspiration, but the world didn’t know them like that.
I was freestyling, winning the local talent show every week. And I started singing this song called “If You’re Down on Your Luck Say (Ow),” and everybody started singing it.
In the apartments, it was me and Young Dro. We ended up sparring against each other all the time, freestyling. This guy takes us down to Raheem the Dream. The rest is history.
When we left Raheem, I went to Shawty Lo. I’m in high school, and I was playing the tenor drums at the time. He was taking care of us. I moved right in and we started recording. He wasn’t a rapper at this time, mind you. Never asked me for rent, never asked me for anything. He did these basketball tournaments where all the neighborhoods would come play each other. That’s what brought a lot of Atlanta together.
When Jeezy and Gucci was going at it — that was when everybody in Atlanta was just, like, boom. I remember being in the club when “Stay Strapped” was out — like, “We need a song.” Killer Mike, T.I., all of them had those songs bunking. That was the moment. The old 112 was just closing down and Visions was the hottest club in Atlanta.
Lo used to always be pushing us. When Dem Franchize Boyz jumped off, I developed my style right there. I was like, they’re trying to rhyme like this, so I’m going to do something totally different. I started yelling and screaming on everything. I was, like, ain’t nobody doing this.
Right to this day, put “Tatted Up” on — you can put it up against any Grammy that’s ever been won. Just the end of the song — [ sings ] “Barbaraaaaaa!” People would be like, “Who is Barbara!?” That’s what I heard in the track, bro.
I’ve always been dancing. When the other guys made “Lean Wit It, Rock Wit It,” I was, like, “No, this is our movement.” I felt like I should’ve been given some type of credit. You can hear me on “Betcha Can’t Do It Like Me” — I felt offended.
I seen them on “Rap City” or something, and they asked who came up with the dance. And this guy goes, “Me.” I leaned back in my chair and was like, “Yo, turn the beat on.” And I got right in the booth. The snap era was intense, the competition.
With “Laffy Taffy” we went straight to MTV — BET wasn’t playing the song. We didn’t understand what crossing over was. We didn’t know that this was another level — like, “You’re No. 1.” I think we wanted to prove for a while that we wasn’t pop.
Anytime you see something that you don’t understand or that’s different, you’re going to look at it with that side-eye, you know? Nas said “hip-hop is dead,” I seen Ghostface Killah imitating the leg thing. But I’m just trying not to eat ketchup sandwiches anymore, dude.
I think when Busta Rhymes kicked it with us and jumped on the album, we started getting a little respect. And then Twista jumped on the record. People was like, “OK, well, these guys must have something.” These are two different characters from two different places that bought into the movement.
Future, Young Thug, all these cats showed me love. Drake, when he put that “snappin’ like you Fabo” in “Nice for What,” bro, my grandmother was like, “Drake said your name!” I’m one of the only artists to have a No. 1 single and have my name called in another No. 1 single.
PITBULL
My first memory of hip-hop would have to be around third grade when I first heard 2 Live Crew. Bass music was basically taking over Miami and, you know, you always wanna listen to what you’re not supposed to be listening to. You could hear it in the corner spots where they were washing cars and the flea markets. Another place where I would find music was this thing called the Box, that was basically something that you could see on local television. At the time that was our MTV before MTV.
But bass music has always been about underground. It’s all about pirate stations. It was all about, No. 1, finding a way to get this music out because nobody would believe in it. No. 2, it was too nasty, too dirty, too raunchy for them. And so we always had to find ways to get this out.
It always feels like we’re the underdogs in Miami, because we’re used to being counted out. Pirate radio, independent labels — that independence allows us to maneuver and navigate differently so we are not, for lack of a better term, choked by a major corporation or company.
I started the whole freestyle thing when I was about 15, 16 years old. I went to a lot of different schools in Miami. Lived in a lot of different neighborhoods, good neighborhoods, bad neighborhoods, worse neighborhoods. And Miami being the melting pot that it is, it allowed me to dibble and dabble in different genres and different cultures. So I could spit at you in English, Spanish, throw some patois at you, throw a little Creole in there as well.
A teacher happened to change my life. Her name is Hope Martinez, and she gave me an invitation to a DMX video shoot. I ended up battling an artist from the Ruff Ryders called Drag-On. It went eight rounds. I did my job, and Irv Gotti pulled me to the side and asked me, “Hey, do you write music?” I said, no, I just freestyle. He said, “Yeah, freestyle is great, but it don’t make no money.”
My brothers had a lot of Eric B. & Rakim, Pete Rock & CL Smooth, Black Moon — they had a lot of hip-hop. But what I really related to is when I heard Nas, “Illmatic,” when he’s using lines like “Got my first piece of ass, smokin’ blunts with hash/Now it’s all about cash in abundance.” You know, these are things I can relate to, these are things going on in my neighborhood.
B.I.G. was such an amazing storyteller. Pac was a revolutionist, Snoop had a flow that you never heard before and Jay-Z was the ultimate hustler-slash-entrepreneur at the time, and I grew up around a lot of entrepreneurs. They had their startups. They were looking for angel investors. They just had a different product. It was called cocaine.
Latins have always been involved in hip-hop, from the days of graffiti and breakdancing. You had your Mellow Man Ace, you had your Kid Frost. You even had Gerardo, which is what really broke Interscope Records. Then you had Cypress Hill, where you had a Mexican and a Cuban represented at the same time. And then you have Fat Joe, and from Fat Joe, you have Big Pun. Pun was arguably one of the best rappers ever in the history of hip-hop. He just didn’t have the time to prove himself.
Now remember I grew up around merengue and salsa. And then around dancehall reggae, and you have reggaeton, all this that you could throw in the pot with rap. I was never afraid to think out of the box. People don’t want to try that because it might mess with their credibility. I say if you’re worried about your credibility, you were never credible in the first place.
The person that really pulled me to the side, this had to be about 2002, was Lil Jon. He said, “You need to rap more in Spanish. I see how you flipping it. I see how you taking it in and out, but you need to rap more in Spanish.” So he’s the one that really saw it and said, there’s gonna be a lane here. And sure enough, the lane exploded, in the middle of hip-hop, crunk and reggaeton. And that’s where I was at.
DJ JUBILEE
I started DJing in 1982. I went to college in ’84. I was on the microphone then. I was doing all the parties in North Louisiana, Grambling State University. But when I graduated and I came home, I started DJing the high school dances. I used to bring local rappers in, but they used to come in cussing so much I couldn’t really put them on the mic because we at a high school dance. So we started making up certain dances after that. When I saw somebody do something, I’d just name it.
A friend of mine named Tyrone Jones had did a slide dance one time, we was at Grambling State University during the homecoming. So when I went back to New Orleans, I started doing the dance and then I just put my name on it. I started saying “do the Jubilee, do the Jubilee.” Then the next week, two other guys in the St. Thomas named Chris and Beanhead, they came and did the Beenie Weenie.
So now every week, somebody come with a different dance. We got different areas bringing up different dances. You got the Magnolia came with the Eddie Bow, the Calliope Projects came with the Jerk, and the St. Thomas came with the Jubilee All, the KC, the Law Law, the Eldon Delloyd, the Sissy Leroy, the Sissy Chris. So we had multiple dances that’s going on every week, and that what’s made my high school dances the livest high school dances during the summertime.
So after that one day I just start making up a rhyme to it. “Stop, pause, stand up tall/Yeah, do the Jubilee, all/Do the Jubilee, all.” And next week, “Stop, pause, pass the towel/Yeah, and do the Eddie Bow.” And before you know it, I had like 26, 27 dances. I was forced to try to get it on an album because when I recorded in the club live, a friend of mine who was another DJ started selling the tape. He got $30!
That’s when DJ Jubilee was born. When I did “Jubilee All” and I dropped the tape, we put out 500 tapes in the stores, they all left the stores in five minutes. People started calling back, “Man, you got more?” So that took me away from the DJing to the music business.
For bounce, there’s the originators: you got TT Tucker, DJ Jimi, Everlasting Hitman, Pimp Daddy. Those was the rappers in the foundation of our music. When I changed the whole game from rapping to dancing, then you had multiple artists that came after me — Choppa, Hot Boy Ronald, Big Freedia, Katey Red.
When I started saying, “Back that thang up, back that thang up,” I didn’t know that that was going to take off like it did. “Get Ready, Ready!” was already hot when my “Back That Thang Up” came out. You know how girls started bending over and then walking up back into you?
Once I hit that chorus line — “First ya wiggle ya leg, cause ya ’bout to get rough/Won’t ya bend it on over/Now back that thang up, back that thang up” — that really influenced the whole city. Women started shaking it even more. But the best part about my stuff there? All of it was made up in the street at a block party. It was made up at a high school dance.
I signed a multimillion-dollar deal with Tommy Boy — 1998, I was hot, they flew me down to Miami, I did the Impact Convention, $100,000 signing bonus. It was supposed to be a seven-album deal, $3 million. I still got the contract. But when I came back a couple of months later, they changed their phone numbers on us. I’m still kind of like puzzled how it happened. I dropped the song in ’98. I was hot all the way through ’98.
When ’99 came around, somebody said Juvenile got a song called “Back That Thang Up.” I didn’t hear it at first, but a kid at the high school played for me. He was shooting a video at City Park in New Orleans, so I went to the video shoot. He had a little rhyme to it and that catch phrase, “back that thang up,” he did it a little different. We went to court. We tried to prove copyright infringement, but they didn’t see it that way. I lost the lawsuit. But I think I really influenced it because he knew my song was the hottest.
His blew up, took off. If you ever noticed, he says, “Cash Money Records taking over for the ’99 and the 2000.” Well, I dropped this in January ’98. But years passed by, we’re still friends today. We still do concerts today. We’re all grown. That was supposed to be my time for me to blow up, to make all my money. But I guess God didn’t plan it that way.
STYLES P
That era, the late ’80s and ’90s, was like the Marvel Universe but for rappers — same universe, different heroes. It felt like we were witnessing the evolution, the growth of this thing we have.
What I felt was always great was the Native Tongues, from De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest to Queen Latifah to Black Sheep. It was always dope to have people — especially during that time period when it was pretty rough in the ’80s, early ’90s — have that amount of confidence to be different. It solidified how dope they were, because most people were just emulating what was hot. I think De La and Tribe was good especially for young fellas on the block who didn’t want to be a drug dealer, you know what I’m saying? To know I could be cool and not be into violence. I thought that that was an important element to add into what was going on.
In our lane, we were looking at Mobb Deep, M.O.P., Wu-Tang, those three immediately come to mind. Nas kind of ushered in our age class, and what was going on with the youth outside during that time period. He was a child of the grandmasters, I would say. He was definitely a product of Kane, Kool G Rap, KRS-One and Rakim, but mixed with what was going on outside at that time. We’re getting cars and chains and nice gear and all of that off of the streets, but we into our rhymes. The Golden Era babies is what I like to call us. I don’t think before that nor after that was ever as competitive as that time period.
Kool G and Kane are on “The Symphony,” but there is no Kane and KRS song, no Kane and Rakim song. In the ’90s, though, you was hopping on verses with each other, you got people from different boroughs, different places. You couldn’t be trash during that era — you was not getting recognized. I would never disrespect those who came before me, but there was people out when Rakim, Kane, Kool G Rap, KRS, EPMD, Jungle Brothers, all of them was out that was absolute trash and still getting recognition, getting honored, getting love. During Mobb Deep, Wu, us, Nas, Hov, Big, Rae, Ghost, you couldn’t say a trash verse or you was trash. Our whole career was that competition. I definitely believe people got scared to put us on their records.
But let’s even take albums out the mix. With mixtapes, you wanted to be in that No. 1 slot. So if you know anything about the Lox in the mixtape era, we was always the No. 1 slot. I remember going to DJ Clue sessions and seeing different artists there and going, oh, we’re gonna absolutely make the illest record. This gotta be No. 1 when the tape come on. I remember doing the Stretch Armstrong freestyle going, oh no, we gotta burn this. This is Stretch. This is getting heard.
And then after that period, everybody’s all super friendly. Internet fame and Instagram and Twitter and all of this to where it’s a lot of fluff. Celebrities like being with other celebrities, but they wasn’t trying to burn nobody on the mic. I can’t say the whole era is guilty — Cole is gonna try to burn you, Kendrick’s gonna try to burn you. But that don’t stand for the whole. They just rather stand with each other, take a picture and be dope, get in the studio, make a catchy song but not really try to burn each other. So I feel fortunate we came from the most competitive time period in hip-hop that may ever exist.
I’m from the Lox. When you’re in a group, that natural sense of competitiveness comes out. You want the best for the group, but nobody ever wants to be second fiddle. You don’t wanna get ate. Never. I never make a verse and go, I want to have the least favorite verse. Never. I always want the best verse. If it doesn’t happen, I’m cool and I’m comfortable and it is what it is. It’s like ballplayers getting on the court. Yeah, you on your team and you want the team to win, but who goes, “I want him to win M.V.P.”? Nobody.
SLUG
When I first became aware of “Rapper’s Delight,” it was my dad’s music. It was him playing it in his car, right next to Earth, Wind & Fire. I remember it reminding me a little bit of “Sesame Street.” It wasn’t until Run-DMC happened that I was like, this is not my dad’s music. I think he was not into it, maybe? And that made me go, oh, you don’t like that? I love it.
Melle Mel, I love him to death. He’s probably my first favorite rapper. But he was an old man to me. Run-DMC, even though they were older than me, it didn’t have that feeling. These are teenagers yelling at me. Run-DMC made me start buying records. They pushed me to become a full-time 11-year-old advocate in South Minneapolis.
By ’88, the golden year when all the great records came out, I had a crate of records, really good ones. I knew how to mix, so I was able to make blend tapes for people at school. Also in ’88, I started rapping in talent shows, but not because I wanted to be a rapper. It was just more eyes on me. I would’ve been a breakdancer. I would’ve been a backup dancer for you.
There was an older rapper, Spawn, who wanted me to be his DJ. At one point, he was like, Hey, you still rap? Why don’t you do a song with me instead of just being the DJ? The first song that I rapped on with him was very Das EFX-like. He did the production, very Beatnuts-influenced. And I’m rapping iggity piggity diggitys. I had not found my voice yet. I was still in that abyss of I can do iggitys, I can do a high voice like Sadat X, I know how to write straightforward like Ice Cube. I could do my version of all these people that I loved. It’s so far removed from what I eventually became known for.
Me and Spawn would show up at battles. I was a little younger. I was a little feistier. People saw me as a target back then. I didn’t care if I won, which is the most dangerous kind of battle because I will say some [expletive] that was super mean or harsh or degrading, and didn’t even care if it rhymed. So I was also creating adversaries, and that played as much of a role as reinforcing to me that I’m supposed to do this as any validation from the audience.
I worked retail at the time. And so I was as tapped in as anybody in the city could be. I was looking at Rawkus, they had some money behind it that they didn’t ever talk about. Seeing L.A. and what was happening with Freestyle Fellowship and that scene there, all amazing artists, knowing they get a lot of attention. They’re critical darlings.
I looked at all this like, y’all don’t know what real independence is. We’re here in Minneapolis where nobody’s checking for it. The only thing more independent than us is a rapper in Des Moines. Like, I would sleep on your couch in Dallas in order to show up the next day and rap for 20 minutes in the clothes that I slept in the night before. I really didn’t give a [expletive].
It gave me a freedom of nobody’s really listening, so I can take risks maybe that I wouldn’t be able to take if I was signed to Tommy Boy. I’m glad I said Tommy Boy, because that brings me to De La, who were a huge influence on the type of risks that I wanted to take.
I feel like I always kind of gravitated towards the people who were like, how do I either intentionally stand out or how do I express myself how I want to and still sound good?
Early on, when a rap crew would drop an album and all my friends would be like, oh my God, Grand Puba is so good, I would be like, what? No, Sadat X is the one. Kool Keith was the one in Ultramag. Everybody else was kinda like, oh, Ced Gee, he’s really rapping. What is Kool Keith talking about? I don’t care what he’s talking about — listen to him. Zev Love X, the style that he wrote with. De La, the style that they wrote with, specifically Posdnuos, but also Trugoy. I love A Tribe Called Quest. What I liked about Q-Tip’s style was that he would just figure out a way to say it that nobody’s ever said it like that before.
The emotional storytelling I ended up doing had less to do with an audience and more to do with what kind of life experience I was trying to have. I was heavily under the influence of the romanticism of people like Charles Bukowski. The drinkers and the tragedies. I wasn’t much for parties, but I liked caves. I liked dark spaces with a couple of people getting wasted, talking until the sun comes up, and then waking up the next day and not remembering what we did. I was fueled by waking up and not knowing where I was. It was a blurry couple of years, but it was very impactful because it was at the same time that my career was starting to do things.
People were validating the [expletive] that I was writing, and they were saying things to me not about my rapping, not about the songs, but about the actual words. All of this is feeding into my ego, and so I leaned into it because of how good it felt. And because, you know, let’s keep it simple, whatever traumas I had as a child needed to be dealt with. This was my self-medication for it. I didn’t know yet that the easiest colors to paint with are the darker colors.
It would’ve been this way if I had been a plumber, though. I would’ve been a messy plumber.
STIC
My older brother, who is eight years my senior, had brought some records home, and it was something that I had never heard. We were in Shadeville, dirt road Florida. We weren’t in the Bronx. He tells me, “This is called hip-hop. There’s a DJ and there’s a rapper, an MC.” He was like, “We’re going to do hip-hop.” I was maybe 8, 9. It was this group called Whistle, “Just Buggin’.” OK. Boom. And then my job was to start studying.
I would write LL Cool J’s rhymes, I would write KRS-One’s rhymes, I would write Big Daddy Kane’s rhymes on notebook paper. I didn’t have none of these terms for the technical things at that time, but I did it based on the breathing. “OK, this is where he’s taking a breath.” So I’d start another line.
I also listened to other music besides just New York. Too Short was a huge influence on me. I used to try to remember all them 80,000-bar verses he had.
I got kicked out of high school for rapping, actually, at a Black History Month assembly. They said it incited a riot.
I was known as the little rapping dude, and my teacher in ninth grade, Ms. Green, was the only Black lady I had seen in the school system with a natural ’fro. She stopped me in the hallway one day and she goes, “Do you know that in all the history of this school, in this racist institution, y’all ain’t never even had a Black history assembly?”
She was like, “I’m going to give you an opportunity: You can take your talent and do something with it. If you write a rap for Black history, I’mma let you perform at the first Black history assembly this school has ever seen.” And I was like, “Uhhh, I get to rock? Bet.”
She took me to the library — I remember because I skipped lunch — and she pulled out these three books. The first page I open up, I see Huey P. Newton. And I’m like, “Who is this?” Because it look like my cousin Carlo, right?
I ended up writing a song titled “Black As I Can Get.” What they seemed to have a big problem with was, “I ain’t no Uncle Tom/To hell with Uncle Sam.” When I said that, they cut the mic off, turned the lights on and everything. Next thing you know it was a melee.
PHONTE
The most vivid memory of hip-hop that I have is my uncle Brod, he took me to the Fresh Fest when it came to the Greensboro Coliseum. This had to be like ’85, ’86. It was Run-DMC, the Fat Boys and Whodini, and yeah, I think my fate was sealed after seeing that. My uncle bought me a Fat Boys T-shirt. I remember Run going back and forth across the stage, just the stage presence. Whodini — God, rest in peace, Ecstasy. He came out, he had the hat on, “Freaks Come Out At Night,” all of that. I remember just feeling that energy and being like, “Yeah, this is what I want to do.”
The biggest influence on how I rhymed was probably Big Daddy Kane. I always liked how Kane was. He was kind of every man, he could do it all. He could battle, he could talk to the ladies. He could be the mack, the cool pimp guy, whatever. He was smart. He would dance. He was the total package. And so my mic technique was definitely influenced by Kane, and that school of Kool G Rap, Rakim, that’s the cloth that I’m cut from in terms of that super precise flow. Sonic-wise, my biggest inspiration was A Tribe Called Quest. I wanted to rap like Kane, but I wanted our records to sound really lush and kind of beautiful, like a Tribe album, you know what I mean? That was kind of my M.O. and still is in a lot of ways, I think.
The hip-hop that I was raised on, a lot of it was Native Tongues. The Jungle Brothers, A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, and even Pete Rock and CL Smooth and Heavy D. There was always an element of singing of vocals in it. To me, it just felt like a natural extension of the records that I grew up listening to. I was born in ’78, so my mother, she always played R&B: Luther, Patti, Stevie. On our first album, “The Listening,” our first single, that’s me singing the hook.
If there was an album that was important to the way I worked, I would split the difference between two albums: “De La Soul Is Dead,” and “Death Certificate” by Ice Cube. I mean, “Death Certificate,” that was a movie on wax. It was no surprise to me that Ice Cube was able to transition into being a director and screenwriter, because he was making movies on his records back then. “Death Certificate,” I mean, I played the words off that album. Nowadays, I think sampling-wise, it would kind of be impossible to make. Well, impossible to legally make. And “De La Soul Is Dead” for reasons that, I mean, are kind of obvious, I can’t say enough about just how much I love that album, how much it influenced me.
When we were coming out, this was ’01, ’02, peak Soulquarians era. So this is the Roots, it’s Slum Village, it’s Common, it’s Black Star. It’s what Rawkus was doing at that time. I was very adamant on, “Listen dude, we’re not competing against other artists in North Carolina or other artists in our city. We’re competing against ‘Fantastic, Vol. 2,’ we’re competing against ‘Like Water for Chocolate.’ We’re competing against ‘Black on Both Sides.’ If we ain’t got nothing that’s coming with this level of smoke, then we just need to leave this alone, because that’s what we’re up against.”
BIG GIPP
My homeboy had to remind me last night, he said, “Gipp, do you realize that you’ve been involved in every era of music from Atlanta?” I said, “Wow.”
This lady named Jean Carne was a soul singer who moved to my neighborhood with her son Joseph — she had this song called “Closer Than Close.” The same year, a guy named Ray Murray moved into our neighborhood.
Once we got together, Ms. Carne bought her son our first studio. And I remember the first time he called us to say, “Yo, my mom bought me a studio,” because that was the same day LL Cool J dropped “Jack the Ripper.” It’s so cemented in my memory. We played that record over and over and over.
Ms. Carne started taking me around — that was my introduction to the music business. She is a cousin of Peabo Bryson. At her house, I got to meet Stevie Wonder, I got to meet New Edition — I got to meet the industry before I got into the industry. Her daughter had a birthday party and we went with the Jackson 5. Atlanta was filled with so many superstars, just because of the civil rights movement: Larry Blackmon was riding around, Curtis Mayfield was riding around, Kool & the Gang was riding around.
Ray started teaching me how to rap. The first records he gave me were the Last Poets, KRS-One, just to give me substance, you know? But I created myself through two artists: Chuck D of Public Enemy and Ice-T. I learned more from Chuck D than in school. Ice-T represented that player lifestyle — that caught a young dude real early. “Power,” I remember looking at the album cover like, “Yo! You’re my guy.”
I was working at a Red Lobster on Campbellton Road as a dishwasher, and one day I was listening to Public Enemy. This guy beside me was from New York. He said, “Hey, Gipp, you like that group?” I said, “I don’t like this group, I love this group.” He said, “Would you like to meet them?” I’m tripping because we in Red Lobster; we washing dishes. “Well, my name’s Mike. Professor Griff is my little brother. They’re coming to town and I’ll take you to meet them.”
He took me down to Fulton County Stadium, and I remember this night not for the concert, but because of the way that Chuck D came to the concert: They were headlining and Chuck D pulled up in a cab. That was something that stuck with me for the rest of my career.
N.W.A changed the whole temperature. It kind of stopped music for a minute. It really put the aggression into rap that wasn’t there before. And then came Geto Boys. When they say, “Who was the greatest in the South?” Scarface, period. As a kid, Scarface was our Ice Cube in the South.
Every day there was new music coming out. It was so exciting. Everywhere you go someone would be, like, “You heard this?” And it was such a change from being a kid in Atlanta, because Atlanta was so soul — there wasn’t nothing bigger than the Commodores, O’Jays, Gladys Knight, Curtis Mayfield.
Goodie Mob, we gave you the heart and soul of where we was from. We gave you everything that brought us up, everything we was made from, what our mothers taught us, how we were raised.
We didn’t come from the projects. I’ve always been around affluent Black people, religious Black people — that’s all I’ve ever seen. Drug dealers and gangsters had never been prevalent in the city because nothing could be bigger than the King. That’s the reason why you had Goodie Mob speaking the way we spoke. Even at a young age, we rapped like grown men. We still gave you “Dirty South,” we still took you into the projects, into the streets. We did all of that. We just did it from a place of always knowing we had something better.
It’s also because we were signed by Babyface and L.A. Reid. We were never on a rap label and all the things our counterparts were getting away with, we couldn’t get away with. I remember when Babyface was like, “A song ain’t a song until you have a hook and a bridge.” And that’s all he ever said to us.
I was very much influenced by wrestling. I got to see artists like Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes, the Road Warriors all up close. The costumes — I knew what it did to people when they saw it. That’s the reason we started doing that in the Dungeon Family. We knew that if people didn’t understand us, maybe they would remember what we looked like.
Who would’ve knew Outkast and Goodie Mob could’ve been this? I don’t think anybody has a André 3000 in their crew but us. I don’t think anybody got a CeeLo Green in their crew but us. How could you beat somebody like us? All you’ve gotta do is say, “CeeLo, do some Gnarls Barkley,” and it’s over.
Every time the South creates a new style, they find something not to like about it. But if you think about it, we have not stopped since us. When you look at Future — that’s family, from the Dungeon — Ying Yang Twins, Lil Jon, Ludacris, T.I., Jeezy, Gucci Mane. They didn’t like the Migos at first!
As long as Atlanta has a strip club culture, we will always be ahead of everybody. Somebody could take a Young Thug record right out the studio at Patchwerk, go right into Magic City Monday, get the prettiest stripper to dance to it, and it’s a hit record! It’s just something that doesn’t stop working.
UNCLE LUKE
This DJ on the radio named Jimmy G, that was the first time I ever heard rap on the radio. He would put the instrumental on and be like, “One day of victory, one day of defeat/Got to learn to take the bitter with the sweet.” When you look back on it, he was rapping, before “Rapper’s Delight.”
He would play Sugarhill Gang and T La Rock and Divine Sounds and Cold Crush Brothers and Furious Five. I was a member of a record pool, so I started getting these records. I would book the artist and have them come down on PEOPLExpress and perform at my teen discos and clubs. Mantronix, Dr. Jeckyll & Mr. Hyde. Jazzy Jay, that was his first flight ever. Run-DMC, I used to bring them down, pay them 1,200 bucks.
When I brought 2 Live Crew down — that was a California crew then — I wasn’t interested in being no record executive. Nobody did hip-hop in the South, so I decided, you know, I don’t take no for an answer, I’ll do it myself. I was interning at the record station, so when the DJ was in the back snorting cocaine, I would be in there playing the records on the radio, and at the same time playing my commercials for free.
My unique style of DJing was talking on the mic, getting the crowd hype, doing all the chants. So they were like, man, you need to come and be in the group. The first song was “Throw the D.” It was a dance that we created in the party. That was the first Miami bass song.
But to me, Original Concept “Can You Feel It?” and T La Rock “It’s Yours,” those were bass records. “It’s Yours” is the first bass record in my opinion. It had everything that a DJ from Miami wanted in a record. It was slow, but it had the booming bass that everybody played at the party.
In the beginning nobody really latched on, it was like foreign to everybody. The guys from Orlando and Jacksonville started copying what we were doing. The “Dazzey Duks” guys. This other record label out of Fort Lauderdale did songs around the same time we were doing it, that’s where MC Shy D was. And then you had Lil Jon start doing bass, the R&B version of it. And then the guys in Atlanta started doing it, Kizzy Rock and DJ Smurf.
People don’t realize there was no hip-hop in the South. Zero. No Texas, no Georgia, no Memphis, no nothing. I would go do shows in Atlanta, and they would have New York DJs on their radio. And so I tell people I created hip-hop in the South. People have a tendency of trying to put me in a box of just Miami. No, I inspired everybody. Tell me who was before us?
And I inspired people to be independent, too. You had Master P with “Ice Cream Man” and I tried to sign him up and he said, no, I want to do what you doing. And I was like, I respect that. I tried to go to Oakland and sign up Too Short, and he was selling out the trunk his car like me. He was like, no, I’m doing it on my own, and I respected it.
BIG BOI
It was like the X-Men School of Superheroes at the Dungeon, you know? All of us — Outkast, Goodie Mob, Organized Noize — the whole crew down there just sharpening up our lyrical skills, getting ready for the world.
It was me and Dre going back and forth. We’d just rap, trade our bars. That’s how we got our deal, actually. Big Gipp was playing the “Scenario,” Tribe Called Quest remix. He had the Isuzu Trooper and Rico Wade worked at a beauty supply store. Me and Dre was up there and then he played the instrumental and we just rapped for the longest time. And Rico was like, “OK, y’all going to the Dungeon.”
We didn’t know how to count bars or nothing. When we got to the Dungeon, one day we learned formatting. With the Organized Noize masters, they just taught us how to do it. Me, Dre and Cee-Lo were like 16 and 17, and everybody else was pushing 20.
Everybody was there: Cool Breeze, Backbone, Witchdoctor. Then later on you had Future. Everything was organic and it was like a school of brothers. And we all came up together. We didn’t go to school together, but we were in school together.
A group called Parental Advisory was there before us — KP the Great, Mello and Reese. They had a song called “Manifest” and it was a jam, a dark, real gritty song. It was underground. They were the first ones and we came after them.
When we did “Player’s Ball,” we got $100,000 each from our publishing deal at Christmas ’cause it went No. 1. When you come from nothing, $100,000 is like $1,000,000, you know what I mean? We were millionaires before we were 21.
And then what we did was, of course, we bought a car. But we took the rest of the money and we bought equipment, an MPC60 drum machine. A lot of people don’t know that we produced a lot of our records, from “ATLiens” on up to “Idlewild.” Songs like “Ms. Jackson,” “Bombs Over Baghdad,” “Aquemini” — we did those. From watching Organized Noize, it was like, OK, if we’re going to be MCs, how cool would it be to paint the soundscape and write the message?
I’m known for being half of the ’Kast and one whole of me. The globe knows us, whether it’s film and television or at my kids’ recitals or football games. The brand is prestigious. They had an Outkast bobblehead night at the Braves stadium. We didn’t have to perform a song, but the whole city came out to get these bobbleheads. It was beautiful, man.
ROC MARCIANO
We used to breakdance — put down our little cardboard, you know, the early days of Run-DMC blasting out the big speakers: “Peter Piper picked peppers.” I remember just being a kid walking to the park and hearing it on the bass speakers. Like, it sounds foreign, something I’d never heard before in my life.
Just looking at how they were dressed — leather gooses and Adidas and suede Pumas — you really identify with that because that’s what you saw dudes in the neighborhoods wearing. Before that, entertainers, you expect to see them in suits — a little more like costumes.
My first album that I ever had was a Christmas gift, and it was “Follow the Leader.” I remember running home from school to the closest spot we could get to — it was, like, my boy’s crib — because they said the new Rakim video was coming out. The “Let the Rhythm Hit ’Em” video, dude sitting on the Rolls-Royce, it was like a damn movie.
Rakim presented hip-hop in a way where I felt like I could participate. It wasn’t in your face with the showmanship. He was more cool and laid back. You could just tell he was rhyming with his inside voice, displaying intelligence. I felt like I could become an MC.
I wasn’t thinking about making songs. Back in the day, it was more like the cypher, battling, who got the best rhymes. At that age, you don’t even have beats to make songs.
I went to school with Busta’s younger brother. I had a reputation around the town for rhyming. So when Busta was starting to develop his own label, when he was first starting Flipmode, he had reached out.
Being around Busta, I learned how hard it is to be successful in the entertainment business. He’s literally like a cyborg. He doesn’t sleep. Like, he works every day, in the studio every single night, you know? I was, like, man, at what point do you celebrate being rich and famous? Success isn’t a destination, it’s a constant voyage.
The internet changed everything. People are sharing music and you can’t keep things suppressed like you probably could at one point. You know, it only takes one person you like to post something that they like, and then bang, you know?
The transition when it became more about the internet really benefited me, because around that time I couldn’t get a deal with a major label after my Flipmode situation. Like, OK, cool, we don’t need the middleman anymore. We could just upload our music and just let the fans decide what they rocking with.
Not only me — it’s helped a bunch of us become heroes. My guy Bronson, Ka, Westside and Griselda, Hommy, Currensy — I’d say I was instrumental in most of their startups. It’s just mutual respect. Lil B, you know what I’m saying? That’s definitely somebody I linked up with that probably people wouldn’t have expected me to be a big fan of. I like that he’s fearless.
Young Thug, too. When Thug came on the scene I was, like, Man, this dude’s a genius. This is like James Brown 3000! I don’t know what he’s saying, I just know that sounds funky .
You know, living in New York City most of my life, I’ve never heard MF Doom on the radio once. And he’s a legend. You could see the disconnect. Doom was doing this before all of us, this independent grind.
To a certain degree, I would say Long Island artists are slighted. Rakim, EPMD, De La Soul, MF Doom, myself — it’s a lot of heat coming out of Long Island, you know what I’m saying? And Prodigy is from Long Island. I feel like saying it’s unsung would be untrue. But we definitely have a steeper hill to climb than maybe if we were from Brooklyn or Queens.
ROXANNE SHANTE
Nipsey Russell was a comedian who had the ability to make words rhyme anytime, about anything. My first time being exposed to him was on “Hollywood Squares” or something, and he went on from the moment he started to the moment he left the show. I said, “Yeah, I can do that.”
I remember trying it for the entire day, from the moment I got off the bed to when I brushed my teeth, when I’m in the kitchen doing dishes, and by the end of the day, I felt like I had it down pat. I guess that was the origin of Roxanne Shanté.
I grew up in Queensbridge public housing — the largest housing project in the world — going to park jams, when neighborhood DJs would bring out their equipment and their speakers. I remember the very first time ever going to listen and hearing, “Bertha’s going to be there!” So, I’m thinking she’s this woman that brings this party. Later on, I found out that Bertha was actually a speaker.
Once you went to a park jam in Queensbridge, it was something that was in you. It’s like being young and leaving a karate movie and all of a sudden you want to kick, you want to chop, you want to try it. You felt like, I got to be able to do this.
The acoustics in the hallway in the projects have a little echo to it. For some reason the beat sounds really good when you bang on the wall in the projects, or if you bang on a stair railing, or even in the elevator. We would just rhyme, which is what I nicknamed the Nipsey Russell syndrome, because sometimes you can’t cut it off.
When hip-hop started, I was 3. I didn’t get a chance to be exposed to MCs from the Bronx. For me, everything was Queens. We didn’t travel to the Bronx like that. I think every borough has its own unique origin of hip-hop.
I came in as a battle rapper. By the time I was 15 years old, they wouldn’t allow me to even enter into MC contests anymore. “Is this the little girl with the braces? No, she can’t enter.” It actually became a source of income from my household. We would find flyers. “Oh yes, let me go get that money.” There weren’t any other women that were like me because I was willing to battle male, female, whoever came along.
That’s why my first record happened to be a battle record and an answer record to “Roxanne Roxanne” by UTFO. Everyone was playing it throughout the projects, and I love the beat because it’s one of those easy beats that you can do on the wall: boom, boom, boom-boom.
For “Roxanne’s Revenge,” I actually wasn’t trying to make a record. I was going to do laundry and hip-hop producer Marley Marl, who happened to live right above the laundromat, said, “Hey, listen, I need you to come to my house. I heard that you can rhyme. It’s not going to take you long.”
I said, “You’re right, it’s not going to take too long. So, let me go put my clothes in the laundry.” When I went up to his house, he played the instrumental of “Roxanne Roxanne,” and I just did a freestyle, you know, using my Nipsey Russell syndrome. I finished it, and I went back downstairs and did laundry. I never wanted to make records or pursue a hip-hop career. I never wanted to do any of that.
There was over 86 response records that were made just for Roxanne Shanté, and we will never have that again. One of the surefire ways in order to be heard at the time, especially during and after the Roxanne Wars, was to make a record about Roxanne Shanté, because she will answer it. She’ll battle anybody.
I was supposed to get a pair of western Sergio Valente jeans, because Marley Marl worked at the factory. Growing up in the projects, you would do anything for a pair of jeans. That seemed like a fair exchange, but I never got the Sergios. I need to say that: I got a hell of a career, but I never got the jeans.
BUSTA RHYMES
I had a couple of big homies that was real grown. I was still in my single-digit years, and they had these Five-Percent Nation brothers in my neighborhood. They were the ones circulating a lot of the tapes — Kool Moe Dee vs. Busy Bee and the Cold Crush Brothers battles. And as “Rapper’s Delight” started playing on the radio, they had an underground station called WHBI, I think 105.9, that used to come on at 2 o’clock in the morning until like 5.
The Supreme Team used to spin on there. The Awesome Two, Special K and Teddy Ted was spinning on there. And they had Zulu Nation radio on the same station, so sometimes Red Alert, Afrika Islam and Jazzy Jay. I would make these pause tapes and then go to school and front like I went to the battles with my big cousins and sell them for $5.
I was up that late because I found out about this station from the son of a Panamanian lady that used to babysit me when my mother was working nights. The Panamanian lady, who I love to this day, her son exposed me to graffiti. He would have this black book that he would draw the pieces he was going to spray-paint on subways. I would sit there and just be entertained, looking at a live-and-in-person movie. These were my first experiences witnessing hip-hop firsthand.
When they had the block parties in the neighborhood, that’s when I was able to really get to see the DJing and the dudes on the microphone. Everybody would be outside until shots blew on the block. But it never ended unless somebody got shot or police came.
My whole lyricism, my showmanship, I definitely attribute a lot of that to Grandmaster Caz, even though I love the whole Cold Crush. I emulated a lot just in terms of my charisma and wanting to be the leader of the crew. I loved the Sugarhill Gang, but when I found out later on that Caz wrote all of Big Bank Hank’s rhymes, that affected my appreciation.
There was also the component of my Jamaican upbringing. In Brooklyn there was this melting pot of every Caribbean community in existence. It wasn’t just about hip-hop. You had Haitians, Trinidadians, Guyanese, Jamaicans, Bajans, Panamanians. This was a significant influence on my showmanship, everything I was doing from the way I dressed to the energy that was in my shows, their flow patterns and the way they spit on dancehall records, the heavy bass line beats. I encompassed all of that into my imagination but in a hip-hop way.
I moved to Uniondale, Long Island, in 1983 when I was 12. We were all finding mischief way too soon according to our parents’ standards. They saw us going down these wrong paths. Coming from where we came from, you kind of looked at it like, “Damn, man. Long Island soft. I don’t want to go out there and be around all this grass and flower beds, around some white kids that don’t know hip-hop culture.” But that common denominator is what allowed the Leaders of the New School to connect. Because the hood was still in the suburbs.
We officially started the group around ’86, but I didn’t have the name Busta Rhymes yet. My name was Chill-O-Ski. The way we got with Chuck D and them was at a talent show that was happening in Hempstead. There were 20 to 30 groups in the lineup, and we waited all the way until the very end. Chuck D invited us out to Spectrum City Studios in Hempstead, along with some other groups.
There was a board that had all these different group names on it like Son of Bazerk, Funky Frank and the Street Force, Young Black Teenagers and Leaders of the New School. And we had to listen to them try to split our group up and put us in one that they felt we fit most with. We were like, “We didn’t come up here to be broken up.” And they respected that.
We told them that we wanted the name Leaders of the New School, and the white kid that actually ended up becoming a member of Young Black Teenagers, he wanted the same name. So we ended up having to do a battle. And they said y’all want the name that bad then y’all need to make a song called “____ the Old School.” We didn’t want to do that because we was never raised to disrespect anything before us. But it was really just a test to see how bad we wanted it. That “____ the Old School” will never surface online.
What was cool and interesting about that time was that being smart and being positive outweighed everything else. You didn’t have too many gangster rappers. There was a large Five-Percent Nation presence. It was Poor Righteous Teachers, it was Rakim, it was Lakim Shabazz, it was King Sun, it was Just-Ice. Zulu Nation was present. There were a lot of uplifting Black power movements that were happening. If you wasn’t smart, you were looked at as a real bozo.
We had Queen Latifah, MC Lyte, Salt-N-Pepa. We always had braggadocious [expletive]. We had “I’m Bad,” real machismo, and girls saying that they were sexy, but you wasn’t really hearing about how dudes were out here selling drugs, shooting. I’m not saying that any of that is wrong. Everything in hip-hop has its place. But I think too much of one thing in anything in life is not a good thing.
When Leaders of the New School was poppin’ and things started to get active for us, that created some internal conflict. The consumer started to gravitate towards who their favorite MC was in the group. In that transition, I was really on my grind crazy because I was the youngest in the group, but the first one to have a child.
As far as “Scenario,” I knew my life changed after that. Q-Tip was always like my big brother and one of my closest friends. It was quite obvious when that record came out I was set up to steal the show. When I came on the mic with my “dungeon dragon” [expletive], it was definitely a showstopping moment.
At that time, the grand finale dude was the one who ended the song. “Scenario,” I was last. “Flava in Ya Ear,” I was last. “A Buncha ____” on “Blue Funk,” Heavy D’s album, I was last. “Come on Down” on Big Daddy Kane’s “Prince of Darkness” album. When you stealing the show, you were last.
“Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See” was a turning point for my life, the first time people heard me spit on a song calmly. It’s safe to say it’s one of the greatest records ever made in the history of the culture. I ain’t saying that because it was me. I’m saying that because it’s the general consensus across the board to this day.
EASY AD
My location was around Vyse Avenue, 174th Street, 171st Street, 173rd Street, right over the bridge from the Bronx River. I started hearing music in the parks just before the summer of the blackout, 1977. It was more funky, it hadn’t crossed over to the hip-hop era.
DJ Hollywood is older, he was doing the club thing, Club 371. They were considered more like a disco type of DJs at that particular time. We didn’t wear the things that our predecessors wore. We wore sneakers, things that was very comfortable for us. We also had the atmosphere, the B-boy, breaking. In ’78, ’79, a lot of parties started happening, places started opening up to hip-hop. The Dixie Club on Freeman Street, Lovebug Starski started playing at the Burger King.
I started writing rhymes around ’77 when I was in the Hoe Avenue Boys & Girls Club. The Furious Three, the Furious Four, the Furious Five — they were really, really good on the mic. They were the MC group that pushed you to want to push yourself. Then it was the L Brothers with Master Rob and Kevie Kev. They were really out there too, playing the Dover and a lot of community centers.
The first group I was with was the AsSalaam Brothers. After we broke up, Donald D and myself went to try out for the Funk Machine. He made it, I didn’t. Then I joined the Cold Crush.
As hip-hop progressed and everybody got really good, we used to have meetings at the Police Athletic League with this guy named Blood. All the groups who were established at the time, it was Flash and the Furious Five, the Funky Four Plus One More, Cold Crush Brothers, AJ and Busy Bee. And the Mercedes Ladies was there as well. And we had meetings because we wanted to establish that if one group was playing in a particular borough, the other groups would play outside the five boroughs. That was something that no one talked about.
Flash, Disco Bee, they had a sound system. They used to record tapes. Then you had AJ and Busy Bee, they used to record. L Brothers had tapes. But their sound systems and their tapes were not crispy clear, because people used to stand in front of their system with a radio and record it. So one of my friends from fourth grade, his name is Elvis, he was actually the first tape master in the world of hip-hop as we know it. We let him plug directly into our system.
Once he plugged into our system, that was the end of that — Cold Crush tapes went triple platinum all over the world.
The tapes used to be distributed in this way: If you had a brother that was in the Army or Navy, in Japan or Germany, they used to mail the tape there. So our tapes got distribution all over the world. And they were clear as well, so it was like you were actually at the party.
Also back in the early days, there was this car service called OJ. You can rent an OJ for $40, put it on hold for an entire day. In the OJ they always had the hottest cassette tape. And so there was Cold Crush tapes in there.
One of our biggest tapes was when we battled the Fantastic Five for hip-hop supremacy in 1981 at Harlem World. That tape kind of changed the complexity of the culture , meaning that the rhyming style that was done by the other MCs, we changed that ’cause it was becoming kind of boring. So we brought a different kind of rhyme style to the table, along with the showmanship and stage performances.
When “Rapper’s Delight” came out, we were already past that style and that kind of flow. And they weren’t really part of the hip-hop community, so no one really took them seriously, the record wasn’t being celebrated. We actually did not wanna make records at all. We didn’t understand the value of them because we had something to us that was very valuable at that particular time — our stage show and our tapes.
Later on, Russell Simmons approached us when Run-DMC was just getting kind of hot. He said, “My brothers are getting bigheaded. I want them to battle y’all so y’all can show them exactly what it’s all about.” Later on we found out that he had gave them a cassette tape and told them that this is the group that you have to be better than. So they study our tapes and our style. So when you see Run-DMC, you see a part of us and our flow and our hard rhyming style.
In 1984 when “Sucker MCs” was the hottest record in the country, we had a show in Chicopee, Massachusetts, at a roller skating rink, Run-DMC and the Cold Crush Brothers. We did our show and we do what we do. We rocked it. But they were the hottest, they were the bigger ticket. But it was very humbling and honorable, they came into our dressing room and said, “Listen, we want to be like y’all. Y’all are the standard which we want to get to.”
LIL BABY
Jeezy and 50 Cent — I remember my older sister had both CDs. I was born in 1994. I’m young, but I was hanging outside, so I was hanging around older guys. I’d already seen how they was living, how they was moving. The older guys was glorifying them. As I’m listening and I’m learning, it kind of shaped my life to this day, honestly.
You wanted the tank top, you wanted the money, you wanted to have that street feeling, like wherever you go, you’re the man. That’s what I got from Jeezy and 50 Cent.
I remember being 10, 11, I used to go on YouTube at my grandma’s house all day. Sometimes they had the lyrics, sometimes they didn’t. The songs that didn’t, I’d write the lyrics down myself. I’d listen to the first bar, figure it out and write it down.
It was local Atlanta artists — these were teen club songs. There wasn’t young rappers all around the world like there is now. Skooly with the Rich Kidz, “hundred thousand dollars in a rubber band.” Different little crews — the MDC boys had a song called “Splash Gang”; Yung Booke, “Sack Right, We Straight” went crazy; Yung Woo, “She Everything I Need.” We had them little MP3 players that you clicked.
Boosie’s always been a favorite, too. More than anything, he was from across the tracks. We were from across the tracks. He had them real neighborhood stories.
Music’s always been my inspiration, getting in my vibe, get my head going. But I didn’t ever think it could do nothing for me. That’s why I never did it.
I got out of prison on July 1, 2016. I went to the studio that day, put the headphones on and tried something. But I didn’t really make nothing. I remember telling one of my friends, “I don’t feel it yet. I’m gonna wait until I run me a bankroll up, and then I’m gonna come back.”
From always reading the lyrics growing up, I knew you needed a verse and then a hook and another verse. I sat in the studio with Young Thug, Migos, Peewee Longway, KC Da Beatmonster. I had a couple little buddies with those little in-the-closet studios.
Most of it was from watching — I’m a visual learner. That’s why I never write nothing down. To this day, I’ve never really seen the writing process, where they’re really writing raps. The punch-in process is freestyling, but not really freestyling. One line at a time, sometimes two lines at a time, sometimes three.
That first time I posted a song on my page and it went viral, I kinda liked that feeling. I never released the song, because it wasn’t actually a whole song. Me and Marlo, “Set Up Shop,” was the first song I recorded that came out. The next full song I recorded was “Option.” People loved it, but it was kind of cheesy to me. When “My Dawg” came out, I was like, “This is the one.”
The first time I got booked was at Club Bankhead, $750. Then I booked myself on Mondays at Crucial, the littest in Atlanta. We’d come in 50 deep, buying bottles. It was a wave. They were booking me for less than it cost me to come in there. But it was just the fact that we were getting paid to come.
Then I was booked Thursday to Sunday, performing at little clubs, the chitlin circuit. Every weekend, I’ve got a concert. I’d go to these new places and the song would come on and they’d go word for word. That’s how I knew every song was a hit.
I got a song like, “This month I want seven/I’ve been going up/next month I want 10.” That was for a show, I was getting $7,000. That journey, it’s been there in my songs. I went from 7 to 10 to 50 to 60, then 150 then 200 then 250 then 400 then a million. And it ain’t going to stop until I stop.
I’m not saying it to brag, I was actually proud of it each time. Like $7,000 — I was astonished. “I get $7,000 to rap!?” I couldn’t have been more proud. You know what I had to do to make $7,000? And they’d give it to me to go in the club and have fun? Life is a dream, almost.
Gucci Mane has definitely been one of several mascots for Atlanta. He put it on his back. Me and Gucci met before I started rapping, from the streets. Thug’s like my brother, we grew up together, versus Gucci Mane, who was like an idol. Guwap was like unc.
Ralo was one who gave me a sense, too, that I could do it. Because I know he’s a street dude. Even though Young Thug was a street dude, he’s been a rapper the whole time, so I never looked at him like he was doing what I could. That was his God-given talent and gift.
I look at all the people, even to this day, that are still in the game after 20, 30 years. I take bits and pieces from everybody, but the people I study the most are people who lasted for a long time. Swizz Beatz is one of my close mentors. I enrolled in his business class at Harvard. And I also study the people who didn’t last, who went out quick. I try to see who all has been at my level and then lost it — how they lost it, what they did wrong. I study that.
I appreciate Drake more than words can explain. But when he first called me for a Drake feature, I didn’t understand music the way that I do now. I think that’s why I did so good. I wasn’t like, “Oh my God, it’s Drake.” I didn’t know the real worth of it. I didn’t know what he was about to do for me. But that’s how I was able to get on there and just be free. Now it’s even harder for me to do a Drake record, because I know what I’m up against.
I used to be on some, “I ain’t no rapper, I’m a street [expletive].” Now I’m not a rapper, I’m a businessman. Rapping is still a business. As good a rapper as I need to be, I need to be a better businessman.
Hip-hop has opened every door for me — the people I meet to the way I set a trust up for my kids, every single thing for me in my life. Getting my record clean, setting a foundation for my family, not having to look over my shoulder.
I was just in prison in 2016. Now it’s 2023 and I’m almost on the top of the world. I’m sitting in an office now and I’ve got 300 pieces of mail. I’ve been an adult and not gotten a single piece of mail. Nobody had my address, all the bills were in somebody else’s name. Now I’ve been gone a week, I come home and I’ve got 300 pieces of mail.
LIL BIBBY
DMX’s album when he had the fully red cover, with the blood everywhere — I had it on cassette. When I saw the picture, I got scared. I was a little kid. What’s the one where he was back and forth with different voices? “Damien!” I heard that and I said, “Is this the devil?”
To be honest with you, I used to be realistic with myself when I was young: “I already know I’m gonna die and go to jail, so who cares?” And then when I started doing music, it just worked really fast and it kind of changed all our lives.
We watched Chief Keef come up. I feel like the whole world watched Keef come up. We were all young, and it was crazy to see someone from our city become so big so quickly.
Once the music started picking up and people started paying attention, the spotlight was on Chicago. I feel like it made me take it seriously. It gave me some motivation — like, OK, maybe I don’t have to die, maybe I don’t have to go to jail.
Drake reached out — that happened super early. He reacted to “Kill ____” with Herb. I was probably only rapping for nine months, and then Drake started hitting me up and invited me to his show. I was a big Lil Wayne fan, Gucci Mane fan, a big Drake fan.
When you just doing you, you never really think about how big it is getting or who’s copying it. I’ll explain the Chicago drill sound that the U.K. and New York is doing: It’s this thing that we used to do in Chicago called footworking — the footworking beats was heavy percussion, like with the ticks.
This producer from Chicago named DJ L, he used to make every beat sound like a footwork beat. And I used to scream at him like, “Dude, I don’t wanna rap on all footworking beats! Can you make different beats?” And he just couldn’t. He was our in-house producer, so we just used to be stuck rapping on these footworking type of beats. And the whole world just started doing it. It’s a Chicago thing.
I never really think about it like that, but every now and then, I think, we just started this in the closet . Social media definitely helped the drill movement, but when I look back at it, the [expletive] we was doing was so crazy. We didn’t do a lot of thinking.
I think most Chicago artists didn’t reach their peak. Most of them passed away. It’s like crabs in the barrel. We Chicago people got trust issues — I always think somebody trying to get over on us. I don’t think we really understand the business that well. Then you feel vulnerable, like you don’t know enough. Atlanta or L.A. always have the older people that’s well seasoned on the business.
I always thought about the bigger picture, where I’m trying to go, you know what I’m saying? Since I started listening to Jay-Z, I was always like, what would Jay-Z do? That’s how I based my career.
NONAME
In terms of song structure, I was really inspired by Kanye West, Common, Lupe Fiasco and Mos Def — that type of rap where there can be messaging and maybe some political themes, but the song is pretty standard in terms of hooks and bridges. A lot of sung choruses, that kind of a thing. I tend to like writing hooks that are catchy. I really like catchy-sounding production with thoughtful lyricism. That’s what I tend to gravitate to.
I have this very vivid memory of my mom playing “Late Registration” in her Nissan Pathfinder when I was a kid, and just being in the back seat, listening.
And then when I wanted my songs to be a little more deconstructed, Jay Electronica and Earl Sweatshirt. “Eternal Sunshine (The Pledge),” that tape from Jay, I’ve never heard a rap album sound like that, or someone attempt to rap to a movie score. That was very eye-opening to me, in terms of what the genre could do. Same with MF Doom, “Madvillainy.” I had never heard anything like that. “Oh, rap could do this?”
At the time, I wasn’t really a hip-hop head. When I was a kid, I was probably listening to Michael Jackson and Avril Lavigne. I was listening to a lot of Bow Wow, actually. Like, a lot. Teenybopper hip-hop. “Doggy Bag,” 2001 — wow. He definitely had a moment. That was my childhood, as far as rap was concerned. It was not exciting.
A lot of the stuff that I was into was based on what I could listen to. My mom wasn’t really allowing me to listen to too much. She was like, “You can listen to this Michael Jackson and one Kanye album.” And whatever’s playing on the radio. It was that vibe. I would go to my friend’s house and they would be listening to Wayne mixtapes.
I’m just now starting to become a real music fan, where I can listen to a lot more genres and styles. Stylistically, in terms of pockets and playing around with language, my generation doesn’t really do that that much, just across the board. And that’s the type of hip-hop that I think I like the most. I’ve been going back to Slick Rick and Big Pun, Big L, stuff that’s either punchline driven or people are just hitting very crazy pockets. As far as new rappers, probably Boldy James, billy woods, Silkmoney. You know Babyface Ray? I liked his last tape.
I’m kind of late being a musician. I don’t know why I make the type of music that I make sometimes. Because it’s truly not really popular. I feel like everyone is trying to stay away from the type of stuff that I do because they want money. They want to sustain themselves. Not even trying to be self-deprecating, but I really don’t hear folks making kind of weird poetic [expletive] like this.
Although hip-hop wasn’t my entry point, being in organizing spaces — Black radical spaces where folks are thinking about leftist politics and ideologies — I was able to find rappers and hip-hop artists that actually do make that type of music. I guess it does lead back into hip-hop, which I didn’t realize. Aspects of it were in the Black radical tradition. I wish that aspect of it was a bit more to the mainstream, but it is what it is.
PAUL WALL
Seeing hip-hop on MTV or BET, that was a different type of hip-hop. It was all East Coast predominant. Even on the radio in Houston, I remember hearing West Coast music and wondering like, why? The East Coast, a lot of what they said, I didn’t know what they were talking about, ’cause, you know, the translation is a little bit different in the slang. We understood the West Coast a little bit more ’cause it was like a migration of people from the South that moved to the West Coast, and a lot of their music was funk- or blues-based, similar to how a lot of Southern music and hip-hop was blues-based.
But when we heard the Texas music, that’s when we heard people speaking our language to us. The Geto Boys and the Screwed Up Click, it was all kind of the same era for me. Rap-A-Lot was seen as the super mainstream, they represented us on a worldwide scale, where the Screwed Up Click was more of an underground thing. We took pride in both of them, but for different reasons.
I remember being like 15, this would’ve been ’97, riding in one of my friends’ car, going to school, him rifling through just different mixtapes and then putting a Screw tape on, that’s how we would listen to it.
A lot of that era was very territorial. The Screw tapes and Screwed Up Click was a Southside thing, but it was almost like blasphemy if you were on the Northside listening to the Screw tapes. I was an undercover Screw head, it only would be a few of us really listening to the Screw tapes like that. There was a few people that I went to school with that moved from the Southside to the Northside, so they would have the new Screw tapes, “Hey, this is what I got when I went to my grandma house this weekend.” If you had that Screw tape, you would be the man.
When I started working, I would be like stocking shelves, overnight type stuff, no customers in the store. So you turn on the “attention shopper” monitor, put a rubber band around it and have a radio playing a Screw tape all through the store.
Listening to Screw tapes, it’d be a particular artist freestyling that really clicked with you. I really liked Lil’ Keke, Fat Pat, Big Pokey. You’d be like, “Which is the one where Lil’ Keke is rapping on the MC Lyte beat? Let me find that one.”
They weren’t confined by the vocabulary you’re taught in the book. They created their own vocabulary. Keke specifically is a wordsmith who would just create his own words, his own slang. I mean, honestly, any slang that we know today that’s Houston-related or Texas-related, Keke’s the one who said it first about 95% of the time.
When it comes to Fat Pat, he had a swag to him with him being a big boy but also real player. A lot of the music he made was about girls liking him, so it was that whole player swag. That’s who you would idolize or look to be. Fat Pat’s the first person I ever heard talk about having diamonds in his teeth.
Big Pokey was laid back, he had a softer tone to his voice, but it also was like very deep and aggressive at the same time. So him being nicknamed the hardest pit in the litter, it really fit him because it was almost like a growl of a dog when you heard him rap.
My favorite Screw tapes, there’s a few of them. “Leanin’ on a Switch” is probably my favorite one. “Who’s Next Wit Plex” is another. Still to this day, when I’m riding around, I’ll put ’em on.
When the Swishahouse came about and started to be a Northside thing, then it was like, oh we can do it too. Of the Swishahouse tapes, a lot of my favorites are the Slim Thug freestyles. “Northside 9,” “Northside 10,” where I remember Slim Thug and J-Dawg just going off. Also in the Swishahouse, they would do this thing where it would be four or five people and they would say one or two lines and then it’d go to the next person, like a pass the mic kind of thing, but you wouldn’t spit a whole verse. Unfortunately, I never got to be a part of that. But those are some of the most iconic Swishahouse freestyles.
I made regular-speed music and it being slowed down was something you would dream of — making a song and it got to be so popular or big that a DJ, whether it be DJ Screw, Michael Watts, DJ Bone, any of these other DJs would slow it down and you’d hear it on a mixtape.
Michael Watts opening the door, allowing me to rap with the Swishahouse, was something where I was able to showcase my talent in a different way. I did two freestyles for Watts, and one of the ones we did was a intro for his radio show. And I remember hearing that on the radio like, man, we on the radio with a freestyle! Like, that’s crazy. So many people are trying to make it that traditional path that you gonna be waiting forever. But if you go one of these other ways and do something different, then you’ll be first in line.
RZA
Summer of 1976: A young kid who had just come back from North Carolina into the streets of Staten Island. There was a block party being thrown by a local DJ, I think DJ Quincy. The DJ had jacked power from the street lamps, plugged up his system and was playing music. And even though I was a kid that shouldn’t have been there — it was past bedtime — I was there. The music, the turntablism of him spinning the record back and forth, the guy on the mic reciting lyrics, DJ Punch. Immediately, I fell in love. I had to be 7 years old.
I remember the lyric the guy said: “Dip, dip, dive/so socialized/you clean out your ears and you open your eyes.” When you just look at those words right there, it really makes a lot of sense.
It was a life-changing year for me. I stayed in New York that summer, and then we went back down South. I had to come back to New York in 1977 and was stuck here ever since.
My cousin, the GZA, who lived on Staten Island at that time, had cousins in Queens and in the Bronx. Soundview Projects in the Bronx was one of the founding projects of hip-hop. Being a few years older than me, GZA would take me up to the Bronx and that’s where I would hear MCs. We could say our style is traced back to the Bronx because it was Soundview Projects that really put the most inspiration on us. And of course, Jamaica, Queens.
At 11, you was almost an adult, especially in poverty situations. I’m talking about going from Park Hill, Staten Island, to the Wilson stop in Bushwick on the L train, and I did that every morning. That was just New York life.
GZA was already an MC. I would just recite whatever he said, copy it. At the age of 9, I wrote my own first lyric. I would sit in school and just write lyrics all day. That was the kind of brain I had.
Before the Sugarhill Gang had a record on the radio, all we had was tapes. Cold Crush versus the Fantastic Freaks, Cold Crush versus the Force MCs, Busy Bee versus Kool Moe Dee. Those tapes, those Harlem World tapes, those uptown Bronx tapes circulating through the neighborhoods, those were our teachers.
But when I heard them on the radio, I was convinced that one day my voice was going to be on the radio. Me, O.D.B. and the GZA, we just pursued it. We would travel throughout New York, any opportunity that we could to show that we had talent.
We had bad contracts. The first contract, I’m glad I didn’t sign it. GZA and Ol’ Dirty signed it — we was probably 15, 16 years old, and it didn’t work. My first contract of course was with Tommy Boy at 19 years old, and that didn’t work either. I felt abandoned by the label. I felt that the best way to do it was to do it ourselves.
I formed my own company first, Wu-Tang Productions, and started selling records out of the trunk. Then when Loud got wind of us and offered us a deal, I went, “Nah. I can’t tie every member of this crew down to one location. This crew is big and we have to spread our wings. We have to take our talent and spread it through the industry.” I felt it was going to be impossible for all this energy to come out of one faucet. “Nah, I need more spigots.”
I thought that hip-hop was losing its roots.
And I knew that me, the GZA, Ol’ Dirty, Method Man, Ghost, we were purists. My plan was to infiltrate the industry. The purity of the culture was taking a left turn already in the ’90s, and I felt that we should enter the arena but spread it out like 36 chambers. We want our chambers to be everywhere.
You think about before us in the ’60s and ’70s, you got Elijah Muhammad making different temples around the country. Or Marcus Garvey giving us the idea that we as Black men and women have to stand up and be noble and plant our flags, calculate our lives. Those things were in the back of my head as an entrepreneur and as an artist.
Prior to us entering the industry, we always felt that Eric B. & Rakim, KRS-One, Run-DMC, Big Daddy Kane, LL Cool J — there was a moment in hip-hop, between like 1985 and 1988, that was just powerful, influential and pure still. And then ’89, ’90, ’91, it started getting diluted.
So then when we came in, we felt we was bringing it back pure, and our contemporaries, as well: Biggie Smalls, Nas, Mobb Deep, Busta Rhymes, Outkast. Our early shows, it was Outkast and Wu-Tang, popping up in Chicago. Ice Cube was probably the headliner, and we were the opening act. And a few of the underground peers who didn’t fully hit the chart surface: Brand Nubian, of course, De La Soul, Duck Down.
Hip-hop is a sport. Now Wu-Tang, of course, being nine MCs and egotistic, even though those were our peers, we felt we were the best. We felt nobody could beat Wu-Tang. That’s the Wu-Tang spirit.
When we hit No. 1 on the charts in the summer of ’97, beating the country artists and rock artists, it was like, “Wow, we did it.” And the cool thing about it was like it was without being pop. It wasn’t like we had a Top 40 record. It was just the culture itself, the path we walked.
TRINA
My beginning is watching Queen Latifah, MC Lyte, Salt-N-Pepa. I just loved them. They were different because they were from up north and wore the baggy clothes. They were just girls and they was so fire. I saw them on TV and I was obsessed.
I remember begging my mom to take me to Salt-N-Pepa’s concert in Miami. I had to be 14, 15. I had my asymmetrical haircut, my little colorful jacket on and my long onesie thing. I was dressed just like them. I thought I was one of the girls.
In concert, it was really overwhelming because they were really, really good. They were dancing and singing and rapping and performing and the DJ, Spinderella, was there. I thought, wow, this is just amazing. And it’s just all girls.
I first did the record with Trick Daddy as a favor. I didn’t know it was going to be a song. I just thought it was an intro of me talking slick to him, going back and forth, arguing with friends. But when I got there, and he played it, I was like, “What do I say to this?” I was so nervous.
But I had my friends with me and they’re real feisty. They was just like, boosting me up: “Oh, no, we got to get him out of here. We got this.” We was all in the booth and they was like, “You gotta kill him on the track. You gotta go nastier.” I was writing stuff down, scratching it off, balling the paper up. And they were like, “No, nastier. We gotta go harder.”
We called Trick, and when he came back and heard the song, he went nuts. He called the owner of the label, and I knew him from growing up. He was like, “That’s Trina who?” Trick was like, “Trina — the only Trina.” “No, it’s not.” “Yes, it is!” And when he came to the studio, he was like, “Oh, no, we signing you to a record deal.” I just left and they were stalking me for weeks and weeks.
They came to my mom’s house looking for me. I’m not interested. I’m going to be a Realtor. I just got my license. There’s no way. I went to Trick’s birthday party, and they tricked me. He wanted to perform the song and I was too shy. I got on the stage and when the song came on, I didn’t say nothing. My eyes was closed. I didn’t say not one word, but every girl in the whole entire club said the song.
The next week, he had a birthday party in Tallahassee. I came out and killed it. I was scared, but I was ready to perform after that.
Once I did the “Nann” record, immediately, I got signed to Atlantic Records. Boom, right after that, I got called to do a Ludacris record, the remix to “What’s Your Fantasy?” So now it’s these two records blowing up at the same time.
I was in the studio a lot with Trick. We had Money Mark and C.O., Tre+6, Duece Poppi. There was Plies and there was Rick Ross. I kind of followed Ross. I would not turn in no records if he didn’t approve. That gave me security of how to put the records together.
Later on, I was battling with the label about certain records that I wanted to do, because I had grown from the records like “Nann,” and they wanted those particular records. I wanted to do these records talking about how I really felt. They felt like that stuff’s soft and your fans are not soft. I had to stand firm in the paint, do what I felt and make them believe that I can make music that I believed in.
“Nann” was fun. That was dope. That was Trick’s idea. I came in, I did my thing. But now here is Trina, and Trina is a woman and she is not 19 anymore. She’s growing, and she’s been through all different kinds of things. And it worked.
Here we are 23 years later. There’s so many girls, you can’t even keep count now. What I love about that, is there was a time there was no girls. It was just four or five of us. Now there’s so much more versatility — there’s the City Girls, there’s Flo Milli, Lady London, KaMillion, Coi Leray, GloRilla, Doechii. It just feels like Ladies Night right now.
VANILLA ICE
I’m the first global hip-hop artist in the world. I don’t care who you put before me or after me, I’m the first. I put rap music in front of people’s ears who never considered or even heard of it. I hit Saudi Arabia, bro. I’ve played Iran. I’ve played in front of the Taliban and Hezbollah, and they’d sing “Ice Ice Baby.” They don’t hold the American thing against you. They look at you like, “This is Vanilla Ice.” And they treat you like royalty.
You have to understand that I grew up with poetry. When I was in the seventh grade trying to get the chicks, instead of writing love notes to these little girls, I was writing love poems. And it worked really well. I had no idea that that poetry was going to lead to my career. But the passion never left. It just kept escalating.
My mom was really good at it, too. She had these one-liners. I’m a big one-liner guy: “Drop that zero, get with the hero.” “If there’s a problem, yo, I’ll solve it.” I could run for president, bro. “Let’s make America the ’90s again.”
I got involved in “Beat Street” and “Electric Boogaloo,” the “Breakin’” movies. I was a breakdancer. I would make 40 bucks a day at the mall, spinning on my head with some cardboard and a giant jambox. Chase the girls around, eat some pizza, have some change left over.
I went to high school in Dallas, and I would spend all my summers in Miami. The whole Miami booty shake thing that everybody remembers from the late ’80s really didn’t exist yet. There was no models, Kardashians, Versaces, not even 2 Live Crew. Nobody here in Miami influenced me whatsoever.
Hip-hop was way bigger in Dallas than it was Miami in the ’80s. I thought all white people were listening to the same music across the country, and nobody was. I was the only one. I had an older brother — he was listening to Aerosmith, Foghat, Mötley Crüe. I hated that. It didn’t make me want to breakdance. Rap just fit me better than O.J.’s glove. It really did. Scott La Rock, KRS-One, Mantronix.
I grew up with D.O.C. — Fila Fresh Crew was his first rap act that nobody even knows about, and that was in Dallas. He had a big hit back in the day, “Whirlwind Pyramid.” Everybody knows he wrote all the lyrics for everybody on “The Chronic.” KNON Radio, a pirate station, that was big. Dr. Rock, Big Al. Just straight from their attic. It was so freakin’ hip-hop and so culturized.
We had a place called City Lights, where I went with my brother’s fake ID. I entered into the talent contest because I’m a battle rapper, I freestyle. I feel like I’m the best. I don’t give a damn who you are — Eminem, Ice Cube, Ice-T.
We would also go to a place called Handy Dan’s, in the back of a hardware store where we would have keg parties. You could park behind it and the cops couldn’t find you. We would have these rap battles against other schools. I had to show up and blow up, you know?
Back then we didn’t have any kind of FruityLoops or Pro Tools or computers at all. There wasn’t even a smartphone. It cost money to go into a studio. I have a lot of self-discipline, and a lot of competitive drive from motocross, because I’ve been racing since I was 8. I went out and made my money on the motocross track, 1,500 bucks a week. I found a guy in Houston who made ecstasy pills for $2 apiece in his bathtub, which was legal back then, by the way, and I sold them for 20 bucks. Instead of blowing it on my car, now I’m blowing it on the studio, hoping this works out.
I blew it up, man. I went on the Stop the Violence tour with Ice-T, Stetsasonic, EPMD, Sir Mix-a-Lot. They were rap gods at the time. I was the opening act for the opening act for the opening act for the opening act for the opener. I was there so frickin’ early, the other acts were still in their hotel.
I had a 10-minute set, me and my breakdancing crew. I had a few songs — “Ice Ice Baby,” “Play That Funky Music,” a song that was never released called “My Car Goes Boom.” I never got so much love in my whole life. I guess word gets out that there’s this white kid that’s just crushin’ it out there, so people start coming earlier to the shows. It got so much attention it went to the headliner act, Ice-T. I saw him sitting there on a road case watching me. He was the first one to tell the other acts, “You’ve got to come see this white boy. He’s dancing his ass off.” And the next night there was Chuck D sitting on the road case with Ice-T.
Chuck D actually discovered me. My first record deal had come from Ichiban Records out of Atlanta. I was on there with Curtis Mayfield. The album was called “Hooked,” which is the same songs as “To the Extreme,” just remixed. Then Chuck D called Def Jam. We had it all lined up. I was on my way to New York, ready to sign, all dreams about to come true. And I get a phone call from my manager, and he says, “Don’t sign with Def Jam.”
He came in and he explained to me this guy named Charles Koppelman from EMI Records wants to meet me. It’s the craziest thing that could happen to any musician. I did “Ice Ice Baby” and then three years go by with the blink of an eye. It took on a life of its own.
You can’t pick your audience; they pick you, bro. And I got picked. Whether you like it or you hate it, you’re not going to stop it. They used me as a product on the shelf. All kinds of funny, laughable things like “In Living Color,” “Saturday Night Live,” “Arsenio Hall Show.” It was just a big wave of entertainment. And if you didn’t recognize it or use it, then your ratings were low. Vanilla Ice was the ratings, and that was it. The most controversial artist on the planet.
The adversity that I’ve had to face is probably more than any rapper in the history of the world. I’ve always been offended by anybody calling me a “white rapper.” You’re racist if you say that. Music shouldn’t have a color. Do you call Jimi Hendrix the Black rocker? My song was No. 1 before anybody knew what color I was. I was influenced by hip-hop. You can’t name any genre or any kind of person or ethnic background that is not influenced by it.
Don’t forget, a lot of these big rappers today were influenced by Vanilla Ice, OK? Nipsey Hussle admits it. You’ve got Kobe Bryant out there winning a talent contest when he was in high school dancing to “Ice Ice Baby,” doing the exact dance moves I did. The influence and the impact is undeniable. It’s possibly the biggest impact to ever hit music in music’s history next to Elvis or the Beatles.
VIOLENT J
In the seventh grade, I met John Utsler, Shaggy’s older brother, and an original member of I.C.P. He showed me “Roxanne, Roxanne,” and all the battling they were doing. He put me up on Eazy-E. How was a seventh grader copping these vinyl records and where was he finding them at? There was no internet. It’s almost supernatural. Maybe he was listening to the Wizard on WJLB at night or something.
We would watch “Yo! MTV Raps” when it only came on for an hour. And we would also watch Channel 62, which is a local channel, and they had a show called “The New Dance Show” and they would spin local rappers’ videos. Really cheap-made local rapper videos, but they were our heroes: Awesome Dré, A.W.O.L., Detroit’s Most Wanted, Smiley, Prince Vince and the Hip Hop Force, Merciless Ameer, Kaos & Mystro, DJ Duncan Hines.
Awesome Dré’s “You Can’t Hold Me Back” album and “Straight Outta Compton,” they just lived in our CD player. It took our love of pro wrestling away, which had been our goal. But we couldn’t deny it no more, man. We wanted to do hip-hop. As far as flow, my three main guys were Ice Cube, Awesome Dré and Esham. Now Eazy-E, I love Eazy-E’s voice, but Ice Cube on “Dope Man” is just a beast. He’s coming from the gut so hard.
Because people have called us horrorcore artists, I wanted to know about horror in hip-hop. My own personal investigation leads me to Houston, Texas, Prince Johnny C. That first Geto Boys record was all normal except for this one song called “Assassins”: “My father was a priest, cold blooded he’s dead/Hypocrite, I caught him basin’, so I shot him in the head/Poured on the holy water, ‘Bless the dead’ is what I said/Then heard the demon screaming as his body bled.” Nobody was talking like that. What I do and what Esham did comes from Prince Johnny C’s original idea.
I used to have cassette cases full of tapes of local rappers. If I’d seen anything that was actually pressed up, I had to have it. So I walk into a store and there’s this guy Esham and he’s got an album out and two EPs. He’s rapping about the scariest [expletive] I’ve ever heard. He’s rapping about the devil, 666, crucifix. It was insane. And he sounds like the devil, his voice.He became our biggest influence. The sky would turn red when we’d play his CDs.
We looked at Detroit, we saw Kid Rock riding in a tractor in his video. He had Too Short producing tracks on there. He was touring with Ice Cube. He was rapping about being from 32 Mile Road, which is way the [expletive] out. It was unique, it was different. We’re like, wow, this kid’s way out, redneck-style, and he’s rapping. And then we’re looking at Esham coming out onstage in a coffin, rapping about the devil.
So we were like, this is what Detroit does — theatrics. Plus we’re huge wrestling fans. We put face paint on after our first EP. The way Kiss does it in rock, in rap who’s doing that, you know? It felt natural. It wasn’t awkward. And we’ve been doing it ever since.
Right from the rip, we did everything ourselves. We pressed our CDs up, we advertised ourselves. And we hired Esham and Kid Rock, the two biggest rappers in Detroit, to be on our first CD. We had Michigan on lock. And Toledo and parts of Ohio. I’m talking 3,000 people at a show. We couldn’t do [expletive] in Pittsburgh if we went there, though.
I remember in ’95, Onyx and Das EFX were going on tour. We got on that tour somehow. We got booed off every night, sometimes violently. It was probably 400 people at every show that we went to. We got to Michigan, 2,200 people packed, sold out. Onyx came to us and was like … We went out last. It was three shows we did like that — Detroit, Flint and Toledo.
That was our first tour.
After ’95 we toured nonstop, but our experiences with touring with other rap groups are very minimal. For multiple reasons, but the Faygo is a main one. If they have their equipment up there, it’s gonna be all wet. Like, we’ve played with Snoop Dogg, but he’s had to go on first, which sucked, because people leave. But he ain’t gonna go on after we destroyed the stage with the Faygo.
In ’94, we got asked to be part of this big rap show in Toledo. It was Outkast, Coolio, a bunch more. We were so honored to be on a lineup like that. So we do the show and afterward the Outkast guys surround us and they’re like, you got your [expletive] soda all over our [expletive]. So we had to pay ’em money for cleaning and everything. People were mad at us and we weren’t trying to get nobody mad at us. We just wanted to do our thing.
You know, there’s a lot of reasons why we’re in this place we’re in. It’s a benefit because the Juggalos are the [expletive] and very supportive. But people look at Juggalos like they’re not people. They say, the only ones that like your [expletive] are the Juggalos. What are Juggalos? They’re people!
I would love the opportunity to get out on one of these hip-hop tours and perform for an audience that ain’t ours so people might say, man, they’re actually pretty good. One time we offered Ice Cube $100,000 to spit a verse and he passed, and then years later he did it for free, out of respect. Ain’t that crazy?

Full text: From the essential spirit substitutes and how to mix them to the most striking glasses, everything you need to serve festive zero-proof cocktails.
It's no secret that nonalcoholic cocktails are suddenly ubiquitous. Whereas until a few years ago, nondrinkers had to make do with cranberry-splashed club soda, now seemingly every noteworthy bar offers a Phony Negroni or a margarita-inspired mocktail. "There are so many people who are nonimbibing, for whatever reason, but who still want to be a part of the mood," says Stacey Swenson, who designed the menu at the Swan Room bar in downtown Manhattan, which serves drinks including the Champaxne Cocktail (nonalcoholic sparkling wine, orange blossom and bitters) and the Chinola Mule (a tequila alternative with lime, passion fruit and spiced soda). The biggest change: teetotalers aren't the only ones ordering them. "Nine out of 10 of our customers also drink alcohol," says Nicholas Bodkins, one of the founders of Boisson, a store specializing in zero-proof spirits. "This is more of an 'and' than an 'or."' He gives credit for this shift to distillers, who, refining early iterations that often tasted soapy or medicinal, have figured out how to effectively extract the flavors of botanicals without the use of ethanol. Today, the best bitter aperitifs (the term for nonalcoholic alternatives to spirits like Campari and Aperol) have all the complexity and layered flavors of their boozy counterparts. They're also easy to find -- Boisson, for example, has locations in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco and a forthcoming Miami store, in addition to an online shop -- which makes stocking a home bar with nonalcoholic options a breeze. Here, the best bottles and other ingredients to have on hand. -- Oliver Strand
The Essential Spirits
Figlia: With bitter orange and clove, this aperitif tastes like a more delicate Campari and is delicious mixed into a spritz or served over ice.
Wilfred's: Akin to Aperol, it has sweet orange and gentian notes and is excellent in a traditional spritz or with tonic.
Ghia Signature Aperitif: Tart citrus, ginger and rosemary notes make it perfectly suited to a classic spritz.
Pathfinder: Bitter and complex like an amaro, it can be used as an aperitif or like a sweet vermouth.
Amass Riverine: With strong notes of juniper and coriander, it's marketed as more than just a gin alternative -- though it is perfect with tonic and lime on ice.
Three Spirit Social Elixir: Earthy and herbal, this pseudo-spirit lands somewhere between a bitter aperitif and an amaro.
Lyer's Agave Blanco: Its toasty agave base has just the slightest spicy kick. Mix it into a margarita-like drink or enjoy on the rocks with soda water and lime.
CleanCo W: This bourbon-style whiskey alternative has the oaky flavor of an aged spirit.
Caleño Dark and Spicy: Comparable to a spiced rum, it's excellent in a Cuba Libre with Coke and lots of fresh lime juice, or in a dark and stormy with ginger beer and a squeeze of lime.
Roots Divino Bianco: This complex, botanical take on vermouth comes in dry (with wormwood and rosemary) and sweet (orange peel and gentian root) varieties.
All the Bitter Aromatic Bitters: Comparable in taste to Angostura, it's spiced with cinnamon, nutmeg and clove and might, according to its maker, aid digestion.
French Bloom: A bubbly white wine made from chardonnay grapes, it can be used in place of Prosecco or Champagne.
The Best Mixers
Chinnoto: An Italian soda made with bitter citrus, it's also excellent on ice with sweet vermouth or a bitter aperitif. Or try it as an alternative to cola in rum or whiskey drinks.
Ginger Beer: Barritt's is the standard for a dark and stormy. For a less sweet version, consider Premium Ginger Beer from Fever-Tree or Maine Root Ginger Beer.
Soda Water: Schweppes and Canada Dry might be the benchmarks for soda water, but also consider Topo Chico, which has a mineral-rich tang.
Tonic: Fever Tree Indian Tonic Water, made from the quinine-rich bark of Congolese cinchona trees, is beloved for its just-bitter-enough flavor and refined fizz.
The Most Versatile Garnishes
Citrus: Lemons and limes are essential to any bar setup, and sliced orange is the standard spritz garnish. With its balance of bitter and sweet, pink grapefruit is a natural companion to aperitifs.
Olives: Bright-tasting Cerignola or Castelvetrano varieties are another excellent spritz add-on -- and also good for a snack.
Fresh Herbs: A sprig of thyme, rosemary or tarragon adds another layer of aromatic flavor to a mocktail.
How to Make a Simple Nonalcoholic Spritz
When making mocktails, most zero-proof spirits can be used as 1:1 substitutes for the buzz-inducing classics that inspired them. One particularly delicious option: the nonalcoholic spritz. Light, dry and refreshing it's also so adaptable that you can spend an entire summer perfecting your own signature variation. Below, a basic formula.
Mixing an Italian spritz is as easy as 3-2-1: Three parts Prosecco alternative (for example, French Bloom) and two parts bitter aperitif (try Figlia, Three Spirit Social, Wilfred's, Pathfinder or Ghia Signature Apertif) with one part soda water. An orange slice is a traditional garnish, but muddling two or three citrus sections -- lemon or pink grapefruit are also delicious -- in the bottom of the glass results in an even brighter flavor. Another variation on the spritz uses tonic water instead of Prosecco: Mix two parts tonic with two parts bitter aperitif and one part soda water. -- O.S.
What to Serve It In
Even the simplest cocktail can feel like the start of a party when it's served in a beautiful glass. If you're looking to upgrade yours, a good place to start would be these recycled-glass tumblers ( $ 132 for a set of six) handblown in Oaxaca, Mexico; they're charmingly wonky, with a rippled texture that suggests the wavy glass of antique windows, and sturdy, too. A more colorful alternative are the Italian fashion brand Sunnei's Murano cocktail glasses ( $ 96), which come in bold shades that mirror the signature stripes found on its clothing. Similarly distinctive are the Los Angeles-based artisan Cedric Mitchell's cocktail tumblers ( $ 180 for a set of two), which are designed to gently roll around when placed on a table, aerating and releasing the aromas of your drink. Unusual stemmed options include the satisfyingly chunky recycled-glass Oli wine goblets ( $ 29) from the Danish housewares brand Ferm Living and the Italian designer Joe Colombo's classic offset-stem wineglass for Arnolfo di Cambio ( $ 295 for a set of two). The idea behind the latter vessel, first introduced in 1964: to allow partygoers to grip it securely with their thumb while holding their cigarette.
For storing and serving drinks, the long-necked Estelle decanters ( $ 195) from the South Carolina-based company Estelle Colored Glass come in eight jewel-like hues, including pale sapphire and rose quartz. (Note that some zero-proof spirits require refrigeration, so check the label before leaving them out.) The angular Carafe N.2 ( $ 400) from the storied Italian silversmith Bragagnolo Argenti -- made from silver-plated hammered copper -- looks like a piece of Modernist art. And the borosilicate Fritter glass pitcher ( $ 150) by the French American designer Sophie Lou Jacobsen and the New York-based glass blower Grace Whiteside comes with a colorful stirring stick allowing it to double as a mixer. For finishing touches, you might consider a set of leaf-embroidered Italian linen cocktail napkins from the British designer Angela Wickstead ( $ 235 for a set of 6) or a few of the New York-based designer Misha Kahn's loopy little glass cocktail straws ( $ 30 each). -- Monica Khemsurov

Teenagers' Accidents Expose the Risks of E-Bikes: [National Desk]

Full text: The e-bike industry is booming, but many vehicles are not legal for teenagers, and accidents are on the rise.
On a Thursday evening in late June, Clarissa Champlain learned that her 15-year-old son Brodee had been in a terrible crash, the latest teen victim of an e-bike accident.
He had been riding from home to shot-putting practice. The e-bike, a model made by Rad Power, had a top speed of 20 miles per hour, but his route took him on a busy road with a 55-mile-per-hour limit. While turning left, he was clipped by a Nissan van and thrown violently.
Ms. Champlain rushed to the hospital and was taken to Brodee's room. She could see the marks left by the chin strap of his bike helmet. "I went to grab his head and kiss him," she recalled. "But there was no back of his head. It wasn't the skull, it was just mush."
Three days later, another teenage boy was taken to the same hospital after the e-bike he was riding collided with a car, leaving him sprawled beneath a BMW, hurt but alive. According to the police, the teen had been seen driving recklessly and was found to be at fault. In the days following, the town of Encinitas, where both incidents occurred, declared a state of emergency for e-bike safety.
The e-bike industry is booming, but the summer of 2023 has brought sharp questions about how safe e-bikes are, especially for teenagers. Many e-bikes can exceed the 20-mile-per-hour speed limit that is legal for teenagers in most states; some can exceed 55 miles per hour. But even when ridden at legal speeds, there are risks, especially for young, inexperienced riders merging into complex traffic with fast-moving cars and sometimes distracted drivers.
"The speed they are going is too fast for sidewalks, but it's too slow to be in traffic," said Jeremy Collis, a sergeant at the North Coastal Station of the San Diego County Sheriff's Office, which is investigating Brodee's accident. The investigation is ongoing pending a medical examiner's finding.
To some policymakers and law enforcement officials, the technology has far outpaced existing laws, regulations and safety guidelines. Police and industry officials charge that some companies appear to knowingly sell products that can easily evade speed limits and endanger young riders.
"It's not like a bicycle," Sergeant Collis said. "But the laws are treating it like any bicycle."
Two federal agencies, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said they were evaluating "how best to oversee the safety of e-bikes," according to a statement provided by the highway safety agency.
Communities have begun to alert their residents to the dangers of e-bikes. In June, the police department in Bend, Ore., ran a public service campaign acquainting the public with the e-bike laws that were frequently being broken there. Days later, a 15-year-old boy was killed when the e-bike he was riding was struck by a van; the driver has not been cited or charged.
Sheila Miller, who is the spokeswoman for the Bend police and helped develop the public service campaign, emphasized that not everything that calls itself an e-bike qualifies as one, or is safe or legal for minors. Under Oregon law, which is more restrictive than those in most states, a person must be at least 16 to ride an e-bike of any kind.
"Parents, please don't buy these bikes for kids when they are not legally allowed to ride them," Ms. Miller said. "And if you own an e-bike, make sure that everyone who is using them knows the rules of the road."
Booming Industry, Modest Regulation
The typical e-bike has functioning pedals as well as a motor that is recharged with an electrical cord; the pedals and the motor can be used individually or simultaneously. Unlike a combustion engine, an electric motor can accelerate instantly, which makes e-bikes appealing to ride.
E-bikes are also seen as vital in shifting the transportation system away from emission-spewing cars and the congestion they create, said Rachel Hultin, the policy and governmental affairs director for Bicycle Colorado, a nonprofit advocacy group for bicycle safety and policy. E-bikes and electric scooters are part of the so-called micromobility movement, propelling commuters and other people short distances across crowded spaces.
The number of e-bikes being sold is unclear because, like regular bikes, they do not need to be registered with the government. (Cars, motorcycles and mopeds must be registered through a state's Department of Motor Vehicles.) Many are sold directly to consumers over the internet, rather than through physical retailers that often track sales. John MacArthur, an e-bike industry expert with the Transportation Research and Education Center at Portland State University, estimated that roughly one million e-bikes would be sold in the United States this year.
The minimal regulation around e-bikes is a selling point for the industry. Super73, a company in Irvine, Calif., that makes popular models, advertises on its website: "RIDE WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS. No license, registration, or insurance required."
"It's one of the very unique categories of vehicle that there really isn't any kind of onerous regulation," a company co-founder, LeGrand Crewse, said in an interview, noting that helmet requirements were also modest, depending on the state and the rider's age.
Law enforcement officials have begun to express concerns about the minimal training required of teenage e-bike owners, and about their behavior. Car drivers ages 16 to 19 are three times as likely to be killed in a crash as drivers 20 or older, and bicyclists ages 10 to 24 have the highest rate of emergency room visits for crashes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some states have begun to raise the training requirements for young drivers, including adding graduated license programs that require extended hours of supervised driving, limit night driving or restrict the number or age of passengers.
The California Legislature is considering a bill that would prohibit e-bike use by people under 12 and "state the intent of the Legislature to create an e-bike license program with an online written test and a state-issued photo identification for those persons without a valid driver's license."
"I know the e-bike situation is evolving," said Sergeant Collis of the San Diego County Sheriff's Office. "But personally, with all these bikes, you should have at least a permit or a license to ride them at the speed they're going."
As a transportation solution, e-bikes seem promising. "I'm really bullish about middle and high schoolers being able to use e-bikes," said Ms. Hultin of Bicycle Colorado. She noted that e-bikes offered children and busy families more transportation options at lower cost. But she worried that the vehicles could lead to an unsafe mix of untrained e-cyclists and unaware car drivers.
That problem, Ms. Hultin said, was exacerbated by "an algae bloom of noncompliant e-bikes." She was referring to products on the market that call themselves e-bikes but are not, either because they can go faster than allowed by law or because, once purchased, they can be modified to do so.
One vehicle that has drawn attention for its speed is made by Sur-Ron, whose products have been involved in several recent deaths. In June in Cardiff, Wales, two boys on a Sur-Ron bike died in a crash while being followed by the police; days earlier, a boy riding a Sur-Ron in Greater Manchester had died after colliding with an ambulance.
In its marketing materials, Sur-Ron describes one model, the Light Bee Electric Bike, as "easy to maneuver like a bicycle, with the torque and power of an off-road motorcycle." Its operating manual cautions the owner to "please follow the traffic rules and with the safe speed (the top speed for this electric vehicle is 20 km/h)."
But the speed restraint -- equivalent to about 12 m.p.h. -- can be removed by simply clipping a wire, a procedure that is widely shared in online videos, and which law enforcement officials said appeared to be there by design.
"There are all kinds of videos on how to jailbreak your Sur-Ron," said Capt. Christopher McDonald of the Sheriff's Department in Orange County, Calif., where e-bike accidents and injuries are rising. With the speed wire clipped, the vehicle can approach 70 miles per hour, he said. Several requests for comment were sent through the Sur-Ron website but did not receive a response.
Matt Moore, the general counsel for PeopleForBikes, the main trade group for bicycles and e-bikes, said he worried about products like Sur-Ron's. "Some products are sold as ostensibly compliant but are easily modified by the user with the knowledge and presumably the blessing of the manufacturer," he said. "Unfortunately, there appears to be a lack of resources at the federal level to investigate and address e-mobility products that may actually be motor vehicles."
Tragedy in Encinitas
The day after Brodee entered the hospital, his family sat at his bedside. They played his favorite music, including Kendrick Lamar and early Wu-Tang Clan. "I read to him for hours," his mother said. "We wanted to wake up his brain."
Three days later, as Brodee clung to life, Niko Sougias, the owner of Charlie's Electric Bike, a popular e-bike shop in town, was driving in Encinitas on Highway 101 when he saw two teenage boys riding Sur-Rons in the opposite direction.
"They were doing wheelies," Mr. Sougias said. He has grown concerned about the e-bike industry, he said, and does not sell many models that are popular with teenagers.
His route that Saturday followed the path of the boys on the Sur-Rons. Moments later, after a turn, Mr. Sougias saw that one of the Sur-Ron riders had collided with an S.U.V., had been thrown from his bike and was under a BMW. "He was lucky to escape with his life," Mr. Sougias said.
Ms. Champlain was at the hospital with Brodee when the boy who had been riding the Sur-Ron was brought in. Paramedics stopped by Brodee's room to check in. "I can't believe I'm here again for this," she said one of them had told her; the same paramedic had brought in Brodee by ambulance.
Hours later, Brodee was pronounced dead. He was a beloved young man with a bright future ahead of him. He was fluent in Spanish and had a college-level knowledge of Japanese; he could dead-lift 300 pounds and, in 2020, was named student of the year at his high school. "I had so many people call me to tell me they'd lost their best friend," his mother said.
Ms. Champlain said witnesses had told her that her son "did everything right," including signaling to make a left turn.
"There should be more education for drivers with the change that's happened," she said. "I'd never seen an e-bike on the road until three years ago. Now I see hundreds."
"They're treated like bicycles when they're not. They're not equal."

But she worried that the vehicles could lead to an unsafe mix of untrained e-cyclists and unaware car drivers.
That problem, Hultin said, was exacerbated by “an algae bloom of noncompliant e-bikes.” She was referring to products on the market that call themselves e-bikes but are not, either because they can go faster than allowed by law or because, once purchased, they can be modified to do so.
One vehicle that has drawn attention for its speed is made by Sur-Ron, whose products have been involved in several recent deaths. In June in Cardiff, Wales, two boys on a Sur-ron bike died in a crash while being followed by police; days earlier, a boy riding a Sur-ron in Greater Manchester had died after colliding with an ambulance.
In its marketing materials, Sur-Ron describes one model, the Light Bee Electric Bike, as “easy to maneuver like a bicycle, with the torque and power of an off-road motorcycle.” Its operating manual cautions the owner to “please follow the traffic rules and with the safe speed (the top speed for this electric vehicle is 20 km/h).”
But the speed restraint — equivalent to about 12 mph — can be removed by simply clipping a wire, a procedure that is widely shared in online videos, and which law enforcement officials said appeared to be there by design.
“There are all kinds of videos on how to jailbreak your Sur-ron,” said Capt. Christopher McDonald of the Sheriff’s Department in Orange County, California, where e-bike accidents and injuries are rising. With the speed wire clipped, the vehicle can approach 70 mph, he said. Several requests for comment were sent through the Sur-ron website but did not receive a response.
Matt Moore, general counsel for PeopleForBikes, the main trade group for bicycles and e-bikes, said he worried about products such as Sur-ron’s. “Some products are sold as ostensibly compliant but are easily modified by the user with the knowledge and presumably the blessing of the manufacturer,” he said. “Unfortunately, there appears to be a lack of resources at the federal level to investigate and address e-mobility products that may actually be motor vehicles.”
Tragedy in Encinitas
The day after Brodee entered the hospital, his family sat at his bedside. They played his favorite music, including Kendrick Lamar and early Wu-Tang Clan. “I read to him for hours,” his mother said. “We wanted to wake up his brain.”
Three days later, as Brodee clung to life, Niko Sougias, owner of Charlie’s Electric Bike, a popular e-bike shop in town, was driving in Encinitas on Highway 101 when he saw two teenage boys riding Sur-rons in the opposite direction.
“They were doing wheelies,” Sougias said. He has grown concerned about the e-bike industry, he said, and does not sell many models that are popular with teenagers.
His route that Saturday followed the path of the boys on the Sur-rons. Moments later, after a turn, Sougias saw that one of the Sur-ron riders had collided with an SUV, had been thrown from his bike and was under a BMW. “He was lucky to escape with his life,” Sougias said.
Champlain was at the hospital with Brodee when the boy who had been riding the Sur-ron was brought in. Paramedics stopped by Brodee’s room to check in. “I can’t believe I’m here again for this,” she said one of them had told her; the same paramedic had brought in Brodee by ambulance.
Hours later, Brodee was pronounced dead. He was a beloved young man with a bright future. He was fluent in Spanish and had a college-level knowledge of Japanese; he could dead-lift 300 pounds and, in 2020, was named student of the year at his high school. “I had so many people call me to tell me they’d lost their best friend,” his mother said.
Champlain said witnesses had told her that her son “did everything right,” including signaling to make a left turn.
“There should be more education for drivers with the change that’s happened,” she said. “I’d never seen an e-bike on the road until three years ago. Now I see hundreds.”
“They’re treated like bicycles when they’re not. They’re not equal.”

IRVINE, Calif. — On a Thursday evening in late June, Clarissa Champlain learned that her 15-year-old son Brodee had been in a terrible crash, the latest teen victim of an e-bike accident.
He had been riding from home to shot-putting practice. The e-bike, a model made by Rad Power, had a top speed of 20 mph, but his route took him on a busy road with a 55 mph. While turning left, he was clipped by a Nissan van and thrown violently.
Champlain rushed to the hospital and was taken to Brodee’s room. She could see the marks left by the chin strap of his bike helmet. “I went to grab his head and kiss him,” she recalled. “But there was no back of his head. It wasn’t the skull, it was just mush.”
Three days later, another teenage boy was taken to the same hospital after the e-bike he was riding collided with a car, leaving him sprawled beneath a BMW, hurt but alive. According to police, the teen had been seen driving recklessly and was found to be at fault. In the days following, the town of Encinitas, California, where both incidents occurred, declared a state of emergency for e-bike safety.
The e-bike industry is booming, but summer 2023 has brought sharp questions about how safe e-bikes are, especially for teenagers. Many e-bikes can exceed the 20 mph speed limit that is legal for teenagers in most states; some can go 70 mph. But even when ridden at legal speeds, there are risks, especially for young, inexperienced riders merging into complex traffic with fast-moving cars and sometimes distracted drivers.
“The speed they are going is too fast for sidewalks, but it’s too slow to be in traffic,” said Jeremy Collis, a sergeant at the North Coastal Station of the San Diego County Sheriff’s Office, which is investigating the fatal accident involving Brodee. The investigation is ongoing pending a medical examiner’s finding.
To some policymakers and law enforcement officials, the technology has far outpaced existing laws, regulations and safety guidelines. Police and industry officials charge that some companies appear to knowingly sell products that can easily evade speed limits and endanger young riders.
“It’s not like a bicycle,” Collis said. “But the laws are treating it like any bicycle.”
Two federal agencies, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said they were evaluating “how best to oversee the safety of e-bikes,” according to a statement provided by the highway safety agency.
Communities have begun to alert their residents to the dangers of e-bikes. In June, the police department in Bend, Oregon, ran a public service campaign acquainting the public with the e-bike laws that were frequently being broken there. Days later, a 15-year-old boy was killed when the e-bike he was riding was struck by a van; the driver has not been cited or charged.
Sheila Miller, who is the spokesperson for Bend police and helped develop the public service campaign, emphasized that not everything that calls itself an e-bike qualifies as one, or is safe or legal for minors. Under Oregon law, which is more restrictive than those in most states, a person must be at least 16 to ride an e-bike of any kind.
“Parents, please don’t buy these bikes for kids when they are not legally allowed to ride them,” Miller said. “And if you own an e-bike, make sure that everyone who is using them knows the rules of the road.”
Booming Industry, Modest Regulation
The typical e-bike has functioning pedals as well as a motor that is recharged with an electrical cord; the pedals and the motor can be used individually or simultaneously. Unlike a combustion engine, an electric motor can accelerate instantly, which makes e-bikes appealing to ride.
E-bikes are also seen as vital in shifting the transportation system away from emission-spewing cars and the congestion they create, said Rachel Hultin, policy and governmental affairs director for Bicycle Colorado, a nonprofit advocacy group for bicycle safety and policy. E-bikes and electric scooters are part of the so-called micromobility movement, propelling commuters and other people short distances across crowded spaces.
The number of e-bikes being sold is unclear because, like regular bikes, they do not need to be registered with the government. (Cars, motorcycles and mopeds must be registered through a state’s Department of Motor Vehicles.)
Many are sold directly to consumers over the internet, rather than through physical retailers that often track sales. John MacArthur, an e-bike industry expert with the Transportation Research and Education Center at Portland State University, estimated that roughly 1 million e-bikes would be sold in the United States this year.
The minimal regulation around e-bikes is a selling point for the industry. Super73, a company in Irvine, California, that makes popular models, advertises on its website: “RIDE WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS . No license, registration, or insurance required.”
“It’s one of the very unique categories of vehicle that there really isn’t any kind of onerous regulation,” a company co-founder, LeGrand Crewse, said in an interview, noting that helmet requirements were also modest, depending on the state and the rider’s age.
Law enforcement officials have begun to express concerns about the minimal training required of teenage e-bike owners, and about their behavior. Car drivers ages 16 to 19 are three times as likely to be killed in a crash as drivers 20 or older, and bicyclists ages 10 to 24 have the highest rate of emergency room visits for crashes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some states have begun to raise training requirements for young drivers, including adding graduated license programs that require extended hours of supervised driving, limiting night driving or restricting the number or age of passengers.
The California Legislature is considering a bill that would prohibit e-bike use by people younger than 12 and “state the intent of the Legislature to create an e-bike license program with an online written test and a state-issued photo identification for those persons without a valid driver’s license.”
“I know the e-bike situation is evolving,” said Collis of the San Diego County Sheriff’s Office. “But personally, with all these bikes, you should have at least a permit or a license to ride them at the speed they’re going.”
As a transportation solution, e-bikes seem promising. “I’m really bullish about middle and high schoolers being able to use e-bikes,” said Hultin of Bicycle Colorado. She noted that e-bikes offered children and busy families more transportation options at lower cost. But she worried that the vehicles could lead to an unsafe mix of untrained e-cyclists and unaware car drivers.
That problem, Hultin said, was exacerbated by “an algae bloom of noncompliant e-bikes.” She was referring to products on the market that call themselves e-bikes but are not, either because they can go faster than allowed by law or because, once purchased, they can be modified to do so.
One vehicle that has drawn attention for its speed is made by Sur-Ron, whose products have been involved in several recent deaths. In June in Cardiff, Wales, two boys on a Sur-ron bike died in a crash while being followed by police; days earlier, a boy riding a Sur-ron in Greater Manchester had died after colliding with an ambulance.
In its marketing materials, Sur-Ron describes one model, the Light Bee Electric Bike, as “easy to maneuver like a bicycle, with the torque and power of an off-road motorcycle.” Its operating manual cautions the owner to “please follow the traffic rules and with the safe speed (the top speed for this electric vehicle is 20 km/h).”
But the speed restraint — equivalent to about 12 mph — can be removed by simply clipping a wire, a procedure that is widely shared in online videos, and which law enforcement officials said appeared to be there by design.
“There are all kinds of videos on how to jailbreak your Sur-ron,” said Capt.

Tragedy in Encinitas
The day after Brodee entered the hospital, his family sat at his bedside. They played his favorite music, including Kendrick Lamar and early Wu-Tang Clan. “I read to him for hours,” his mother said. “We wanted to wake up his brain.”

Hours later, Brodee was pronounced dead. He was a beloved young man with a bright future. He was fluent in Spanish and had a college-level knowledge of Japanese; he could dead-lift 300 pounds and, in 2020, was named student of the year at his high school. “I had so many people call me to tell me they’d lost their best friend,” his mother said.
Champlain said witnesses had told her that her son “did everything right,” including signaling to make a left turn.
“There should be more education for drivers with the change that’s happened,” she said. “I’d never seen an e-bike on the road until three years ago. Now I see hundreds.”
“They’re treated like bicycles when they’re not. They’re not equal.”

A Homeless Crisis Is a Test of Portland's Identity: [National Desk]

Full text: Come to Portland, his sister said. It's green and beautiful, people are friendly and there are plenty of jobs.
In 2018, Anthony Saldana took his sister's advice. He left Las Vegas, where he was working in a casino, and moved to a Portland suburb.
He rented an apartment and got a job at Home Depot. Mr. Saldana, though, never quite found his footing. By early 2021, he was living in a tent, under a tree on the edge of a highway in Portland.
He wouldn't let his sister, Kaythryn Richardson, visit him and shared only a few details with her about his life on the streets. He told her about the "bad people" terrorizing him and about the Disney movies he had watched to drown out the chaos that was slowly pulling him under.
"Hello sister," he texted last October. "I'm hurting."
All of Portland, it seems, has been trying to figure out what has been happening to people like Mr. Saldana, and to Portland itself.
This city of 635,000, home to the world's largest bookstore and majestic views of snowcapped Mount Hood, has long grappled with homelessness. But during the pandemic this perennial problem turned into an especially desperate and sometimes deadly crisis that is dividing Portland over how to fix it.
While other cities in the West, like San Diego and Phoenix, face similar issues, the suffering on Portland's streets has dealt a singular challenge to the city's identity as a liberal bastion that prides itself on embracing transplants from across the country.
In 2022, Portland experienced a spate of homicides and other violence involving homeless victims that rattled many in the community: a 42-year-old homeless woman shot in the face by two teenagers who were hunting rats with a pellet gun; a 26-year-old homeless woman stabbed in the chest outside her tent; another homeless woman, 31, fatally shot at close range by a stranger.
The search for answers points in many directions -- to city and county officials who allowed tents on the streets because the government had little to offer in the way of housing, to Oregon voters who backed decriminalizing hard drugs and to the unrest that rocked Portland in 2020 and left raw scars.
But what has turbocharged the city's troubles in recent years is fentanyl, the deadly synthetic drug, which has transformed long standing problems into a profound test of the Portland ethos.
Outreach workers in Portland say rampant fentanyl use, has coincided with the increasing turmoil among many homeless residents.
Doctors who care for people living on the streets say fentanyl addiction is proving harder to treat than many other dependencies.
Yet, as they have for years, legions of volunteers -- professionals, recovering addicts and anarchists -- routinely hand out sandwiches, wound kits and clementines around the encampments. Those volunteers include people like Jakob Hollenbeck, 23, who last year befriended a group camped out across the street from his house in Portland's upscale Pearl District.
One of the tent dwellers was Mr. Saldana.
Mr. Hollenbeck, a recent college graduate, tried to help Mr. Saldana, 54, get back on his feet by giving him food, money and camping supplies.
And as he learned the roots of Mr. Saldana's struggles, Mr. Hollenbeck became even more determined to help him.
"We are failing our unhoused neighbors every day," Mr. Hollenbeck said. "And it's something we can fix."
'Everything Just Seemed To Work'
Josh Alpert had a similar can-do attitude when he moved to Portland in the 1990s.
Mr. Alpert found an intense sense of community and "pride of place" among the many other transplants he met there.
"There was a sense that we are this Western city marching to our own drummer," said Mr. Alpert, who grew up in Pittsburgh and, after coming to Portland, quickly decided he wanted to go into government.
This vibrant civic life played out while the city's economy was growing and tourists were flocking to landmarks like Powell's City of Books, the nation's largest free-standing bookstore.
"Everything just seemed to work," said Mr. Alpert, who worked for former Mayor Charlie Hales, from 2013 to 2016, including as his chief of staff.
Then came the tents.
At first, many were concentrated downtown and a few others were scattered across the city. Some of the early tent dwellers arrived with the Occupy movement in 2011, which involved camping in public spaces across the United States to protest income inequality.
"Occupy sent the message to the houseless that it's OK to come out of the corners and be visible," Mr. Alpert said.
The protests ended, but Mr. Alpert said many of the Occupy activists stayed in tents "because they had nowhere to go."
The city's popularity as a destination for transplants was helping to push rents beyond the reach of people who lacked a financial safety net, and forcing some of them onto the streets.
As the city's point person on homelessness, Mr. Alpert supported new approaches to the housing shortage like the creation of temporary "villages" that could be run by homeless people themselves.
Instead of tents spread throughout the city, the villages, with names like Hazelnut Grove, were meant to be self-governing communities that empowered their residents.
"There was such a vital energy in the houseless community back then," said Vahid Brown, who has worked with the homeless population for many years and was involved in the "village movement."
Today, there are an estimated 6,300 homeless people in Multnomah County, which includes Portland. Only a relatively small number of them are still living in the homeless-run villages. Many live in tents under bridges, behind a hospital and in pine-scented groves. Some have fire pits. One has an American flag out front. A wheelchair. A library. A dead rat.
Mr. Alpert, who left government in 2016, says he has been blamed for allowing the tents to spread early on. "I wrestle even still with whether it was fair or unfair criticism," he said.
Within a few years, the tents became more entrenched. In 2018, the federal appeals court that covers Oregon and much of the West ruled that cities could not prohibit people from sleeping outside if an alternative shelter wasn't available.
Mr. Alpert still lives in Portland and likes to take long walks around the city. Over the past two years, he has seen at least 10 people overdosing, and has encountered a man walking around downtown naked and screaming.
"This is not the same issue that we were fighting," he said. "This is something different."
'Love You, Sis'
When Anthony Saldana arrived in the city in 2018, he first rented his own place and then bunked with his sister and her partner, Phillip.
But Mr. Saldana just couldn't make it work. As the pandemic wore into 2021, Mr. Saldana left his sister's house and started sleeping outside.
He returned regularly for "Anthony Day" -- Ms. Richardson's day off from her job at a local grocery store. She served him meat lover's pizza, while he did his laundry and took a shower.
In the morning, Mr. Saldana headed back to his tent.
He would say goodbye and leave. No hugs or even a fist bump. His sister said Mr. Saldana didn't like to be touched.
Mr. Saldana was 4 years old when he went to live with a relative in California, who abused him until he was a teenager, his sister said.
Mr. Saldana was eventually diagnosed with depression, which he often tried to treat with alcohol and meth. While he was working for Home Depot, his sister said, the company gave him time off from work to attend a month of rehab.
Ms. Richardson said her brother wasn't easy to be around when he was high and paranoid. But they all looked forward to Anthony Day.
"Thanks for dinner, it was awesome," Mr. Saldana messaged after a visit in September. "Have a wonderful day. Love you sis."
"You're welcome," Ms. Richardson wrote back. "Stay safe. Love you."
2 Days, 7 Deadly Overdoses
The summer of 2020, after the killing of George Floyd, was a tumultuous time in many American cities, but particularly in Portland.
Protesters clashed with the police in the downtown streets from May through that fall, resulting in more than 1,000 arrests.
Sgt. Jerry Cioeta, of the Portland Police Bureau, worked 71 days with only three days off during the unrest. His hearing was damaged after an explosive thrown by a protester hit him in the hip.
After the street battles ended and Sergeant Cioeta resumed patrols, he soon found himself in a changed city.
In November 2020, amid the national reckoning over policing and criminal justice, Oregon voters by a wide margin approved a ballot measure that lowered the penalties for possessing small amounts of drugs like meth and opioids.
While an increasing number of states no longer criminally charge people for using marijuana, Oregon took the bold step of decriminalizing the possession of "hard drugs."
When the police in Oregon see someone using these drugs, they can hand out a $ 100 ticket and a card listing a hotline for addiction treatment.
Known as Measure 110, the law was meant to focus the government's efforts on treating addiction, not on arresting users.
At the same time, it allocated millions of dollars in additional funding for addiction services across Oregon. But the new money was slow to roll out.
Sergeant Cioeta, who oversees a bike squad that patrols downtown Portland, believes Measure 110 is fueling more drug use by sending the false message that "all drugs are legal."
Others say that drug use has been common in Portland for decades and that Measure 110 has only brought the problem more out into the open.
Fentanyl was not a major focus of the discussions around decriminalization because it was not as widely used as it is now.
In 2020, the year voters approved the measure, 69 people in Multnomah County fatally overdosed from synthetic opioids, mainly fentanyl, according to the county health department.
Last year, such overdoses killed 209 people in the county, and the drug is smoked openly on Portland's downtown streets.
Fifty times more powerful than heroin, fentanyl sets off a high that "human brains have never seen before," said Dr. Andy Mendenhall, who runs Central City Concern, one of Portland's largest nonprofit providers of mental health and homeless services.
"It makes it harder for folks to stay in recovery," he said at a locally televised forum about addiction.
Fentanyl is often being used with other drugs, such as a synthetic form of meth, which outreach workers and the police say is also contributing to the increasingly volatile behavior on the streets.
Amid an outcry over Measure 110, the Oregon House recently passed a bill that would create stiffer consequences for possession of certain amounts of fentanyl.
Over two days in mid-May, seven people died of overdoses across Portland. One person died in a car, another in a tent and a third in a grassy area, three blocks from Powell's City of Books.
'He Wanted Me To Know'
When Jakob Hollenbeck graduated from the University of Oregon last year and moved to the Pearl District, a neighborhood of loft apartments and nice restaurants, he was keenly aware of Portland's troubles.
Mr. Hollenbeck wasn't afraid of the crime or homelessness, but he was upset with how the city was dealing with these issues.
Under Mayor Ted Wheeler, a Democrat, the city had been steadily stepping up the removal of tents and trying to move people into shelters.
But many of the people being displaced simply packed up their belongings and moved their tents to another patch of sidewalk.
Recognizing that many people struggling with addiction and mental illness do not want to live in a shelter, the Wheeler administration is developing several large encampment sites that will house people in "pods," small basic structures with heating and air-conditioning units.
These pod clusters are different from many of the villages that sprung up a decade ago, because government contractors will supervise them.
"There is nothing humane about living outside in the elements, and I have sought to change that," Mr. Wheeler said in an interview.
Preliminary results from a recent survey show that while the number of people who are homeless has risen, the portion who have been homeless for extended periods fell this year; officials said more people were also using shelters this year.
Mr. Hollenbeck, who is a believer in progressive approaches, said the city can only truly solve the problem by providing more affordable housing and mental health services. In the meantime, he said, citizens needed to step in to help their neighbors.
Mr. Hollenbeck raised $ 3,000 on GoFundMe to buy his neighbors camping supplies, and he borrowed his parents' car to help Mr. Saldana relocate after his tent was taken down.
When Mr. Hollenbeck, a paralegal, learned that Mr. Saldana had been hit by a car, he helped prepare a lawsuit against the company that had insured the car involved in the accident.
Then, Mr. Saldana returned the favor.
One night last December, Mr. Hollenbeck was walking home with takeout when a man approached him and demanded his food. When Mr. Hollenbeck refused, the man brandished a shard of glass and said he was going to stab him.
Mr. Saldana and another man bounded out of their tents and stood between Mr. Hollenbeck and the man with the shard, who was also homeless. Mr. Saldana yelled at the man to leave, which he did.
"I don't know what would have happened to me if he hadn't done that," said Mr. Hollenbeck, who was interviewed by local news outlets about Mr. Saldana's courageous act.
A few weeks after the incident, Mr. Saldana told Mr. Hollenbeck about the abuse that he had suffered as a child and how it had shaped his life.
"He wanted me to know that's why he lived on the street," Mr. Hollenbeck recalled. "But he said he couldn't do it much longer."
'People Act Like There's Not Enough'
Just as Portland has attracted college-educated transplants, it has also offered respite to people from around the country who are living on the margins.
Kaetly and Irida Wren were unemployed and sleeping in their car in Memphis in the spring of 2021. Shunned by certain family members, the transgender couple saw few options in the South.
"Let's go to Portland," Kaetly remembers saying.
Kaetly, 21, was inspired by the city's protests. An opioid user, she also heard that heroin was plentiful in Portland. Irida, 26, was told the city offered generous homeless services.
The couple packed up their Nissan Altima and made the 2,200-mile drive. They found support from social workers and groups like Street Roots, which publishes a newspaper focused on homeless issues.
On many nights, they stayed in shelters, but they said camping on the streets was easier.
Government data and interviews with homeless residents underscore Portland's lure, far and wide. A Houston woman whose home was destroyed by Hurricane Harvey. A New Jersey activist who came for the Occupy protests more than a decade ago. A St. Louis woman who had been sexually abused by a relative.
The couple had hoped to find a sense of community in the encampments.
Instead, they encountered "infighting," which they attributed partly to fentanyl.
The pull of the drug is so strong that many users are paranoid that supplies are running out, Kaetly said.
"People act like there is not enough of it on the streets for all of us. When in reality, there is more of it on the streets than there ever has been," she said.
On the night of April 18, the couple were in their tent across from a church when a man slashed the side of the tent and attacked Irida with a knife.
She was stabbed six times in the torso and hands, according to the police report, and was "fainting" shortly after officers arrived on the scene.
They planned to head back to Tennessee last month. Portland "is definitely not what I expected," Irida said.
Carrots or Sticks?
There are days when Portland is not what Jessie Burke, a co-owner of the Society Hotel, expected, either.
When a woman burst into her hotel lobby and wrestled with two employees. Or when she watched another tent dweller bang her head bloody against a storefront window.
Ms. Burke, who with her husband opened the boutique hotel in the Old Town neighborhood in 2015, believes that Portland can recover but that it needs to adjust its attitudes toward homelessness.
In recent years, she said, the city has been too permissive about camping and people using hard drugs in public places.
"Some people respond to carrots, and some respond to sticks," Ms. Burke said. "But we have used carrots here."
She is encouraged by the encampment removals, which have reduced the number of tents in the area around her hotel.
But she said government officials needed to compel more homeless people into mental health and addiction services.
"A lot of people say, 'How do we get the old Portland back?"' Ms. Burke said. "I think we need to look at the lessons learned from this time and to get to something else."
Anthony's Day
While some debate the city's future, Mr. Hollenbeck has been focused on the immediate needs of his homeless neighbors.
Before leaving for a trip in early March, Mr. Hollenbeck checked in on Mr. Saldana.
You need anything, Anthony?
When there was no answer from inside the tent, Mr. Hollenbeck figured his neighbor was sleeping.
Two weeks later, when Mr. Hollenbeck returned, there was still no sign of Mr. Saldana.
"Haven't seen you around lately -- hope you are good," Mr. Hollenbeck wrote in an email to Mr. Saldana on April 13.
Five days later, the police received a call about a body found by a worker preparing to remove Mr. Saldana's tent.
According to a police report, the body had been "unnoticed for several weeks," and investigators struggled to identify him through fingerprints. Eventually, the police determined it was Mr. Saldana.
He died from a fentanyl overdose, his sister said.
Not long after his friend's death, Mr. Hollenbeck got word that the insurance company was offering to compensate Mr. Saldana for the injuries he sustained when he was hit by the car.
He would have received $ 16,600, enough to cover many months of rent.
"The conditions that we have created as a society didn't let me get that money to him in time," Mr. Hollenbeck said. "That is something that haunts me."
Ms. Richardson appreciates what Mr. Hollenbeck did to support and comfort her brother. And she will hold on to the image of her brother standing up to protect his young neighbor.
It was Portland at its best, and proof to her that the city's ethos of community endures.
But in the end, that wasn't enough to save her brother from the hurt that followed him wherever he went.
The last time she saw him was on Feb. 26 when he visited her house for an Anthony Day.
He hated having his picture taken, so when she saw him asleep in the living room that day, Ms. Richardson secretly snapped a photo.
He was stretched out on the couch, which was draped in a large blanket patterned like the American flag. His head rested where the stars and stripes came together.
Ms. Richardson posted the image on Facebook after his death. "I love you Anthony," she wrote. "And know that you are now at peace."

Full text: Researchers recently discovered the coldest star ever found that emits radio waves.
When you sit at a campfire and look up at the stars, even the tiniest pinpricks of light that you see are massive furnaces, producing intense heat. But hidden among these infernal embers are celestial bodies so dim that they're invisible to the naked eye.
One such star, a brown dwarf smaller than Jupiter, recently became the coldest star ever to be detected with a radio telescope. At a paltry 797 degrees Fahrenheit, it's cooler than the average campfire: an ideal star for roasting marshmallows. Don't forget the graham crackers and chocolate.
A big star like our sun, said Kovi Rose, a doctoral candidate in astronomy at the University of Sydney, is a "nuclear fusion machine that's working perfectly in space and compressing hydrogen gas and fusing that into helium." That produces energy that radiates from the star, most noticeable to us in the form of heat and light.
Brown dwarfs, sometimes called "failed stars," are too small to attain the powerful gravity required to compress hydrogen to the point of nuclear fusion. Instead, "a brown dwarf is partway, in mass and temperature, between a star and a planet," said Tara Murphy, an astronomy professor at the University of Sydney and a co-author with Mr. Rose of a paper published on Thursday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. The existence of brown dwarfs was hypothesized 60 years ago, but "they were very hard to find, because they're not very bright," Dr. Murphy said.
While brown dwarfs don't give off much visible light, they do emit energy at other frequencies, which different kinds of telescopes can detect. In 2011, scientists at the California Institute of Technology used infrared telescopes to discover a number of brown dwarfs, including one they named T8 Dwarf WISE J062309.94−045624.6.
Even though the star had been identified based on its infrared emissions, there's still a wealth of information to be yielded by the other energy it gives off.
"Every band of that electromagnetic spectrum gives you a completely different window into the universe," Dr. Murphy said. "It's like a detective story." The radio waves that Dr. Murphy and Mr. Rose study reveal information about stars' magnetic fields. (Despite their name, radio waves don't emit sound.)
As part of Mr. Rose's Ph.D. thesis, he sifted through radio-wave data generated by the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder. "Each time that I found something that was able to be cross-matched to the coordinates in the sky of a known star, it was really exciting and really interesting," he said.
It was surprising to discover, the researchers said, that one of the sources of radio waves was none other than the brown dwarf T8 Dwarf WISE J062309.94−045624.6, in part because fewer than 10 percent of brown dwarfs emit radio waves.
"Once we realized that it was a brown dwarf, yeah, it was definitely quite exciting, because then you kind of go down this rabbit hole of trying to figure out what the implications are, and what we can learn about the magnetic field properties," Mr. Rose said.
The researchers confirmed their findings with other radio telescopes, including MeerKAT in South Africa and the Australia Telescope Compact Array. While not the coldest star ever discovered (that was WISE J085510.83-071442.5, with a temperature between minus 54 and 9 degrees Fahrenheit), it is the coldest star ever observed emitting radio waves.
Elena Manjavacas, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore who was not involved with the study, said the findings were "very cool." Combining the results with those from other kinds of telescopes "gives you a complete picture of basically the 3-D structure of the brown dwarf."
Beyond the scientific implications of the discovery, Mr. Rose emphasized the bigger picture.
Being out in nature, looking out at the expanse of twinkling lights and knowing that, "in some cases, they're cooler than the smoke that's rising off our campfire -- I mean, that's inspiring. It's inspiring and humbling to understand our place in the universe," he said.

Full text: A passer-by saw the girl's sign at a parking lot in Long Beach, Calif., after a 61-year-old man had taken her from Texas days earlier, officials said.
A 13-year-old Texas girl was kidnapped, driven across multiple state lines and then rescued after she held up a handmade "Help Me!" sign in a California parking lot, the authorities said.
Steven Robert Sablan, 61, of Cleburne, Texas, was indicted in California on Thursday and charged with one count of kidnapping and one count of transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, according to a news release from federal prosecutors.
The girl left home on July 6 without telling her parents because she had plans to visit a friend who moved to Australia a year earlier, prosecutors said.
She was walking to a bus stop in San Antonio when Mr. Sablan, whose name was spelled Sabalan in court records, pulled up in a gray Nissan Sentra, pointed a gun and told her, "If you don't get in the car with me, I am going to hurt you," according to court documents.
Fearing for her life, the victim obeyed him, court documents said.
At one point during the drive, the girl told Mr. Sablan about her friend in Australia. He said that he could take her to a cruise ship to get there but that she would have to do something for him, court documents said.
He then pulled over and sexually assaulted her. Over the next two days, he drove her from Texas through New Mexico, Arizona and California, sexually assaulting her at various points along the way, according to court records.
On the morning of July 9, they stopped at a laundromat in Long Beach, Calif.
Mr. Sablan told her to change clothes in the car and then took her clothes and went inside. This gave the girl the opportunity to write "Help Me!" on a piece of paper.
A passer-by called law enforcement, who upon arrival saw Mr. Sablan standing outside the vehicle and saw the girl, who mouthed the word "help."
The Long Beach police described the girl in a statement as "visibly emotional and distressed."
Officers searched the vehicle and found a BB gun, the girl's sign, a switchblade and handcuffs, according to court documents.
They took Mr. Sablan into custody, and the authorities determined that the victim was a reported runaway missing person from San Antonio.
Mr. Sablan's lawyer could not be reached for comment on Saturday. Mr. Sablan is scheduled to be arraigned on July 31 in the U.S. District Court in downtown Los Angeles.
Mr. Sablan was also wanted in connection with a burglary charge in Fort Worth, Texas. He was convicted of robbery with a deadly weapon in 1979, robbery and burglary with a deadly weapon in 1985, and possession of a controlled substance in 2016, prosecutors said.

Full text: The factory, made possible by government subsidies, could produce nearly half of the electric-car batteries needed in Britain by 2030.
Tata, the Indian-based conglomerate, announced on Wednesday that it would build a 4 billion-pound ( $ 5.2 billion) battery plant in western England, a commitment sought by the auto industry and lawmakers hoping to stem fears of an exodus of car manufacturers from Britain.
Tata owns Jaguar Land Rover, the British-based automaker, and the company's factories in Britain would be important customers for the batteries. The government said the plant, which would create 4,000 jobs, could eventually produce almost half of the electric-car batteries needed by Britain by 2030.
The announcement was made possible by a large package of subsidies offered by the government of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. It came as worries have grown in recent weeks that Britain's car industry could be decimated by the shift to electric vehicles, coupled with the country's exit from the European Union, the main export market for British-made cars.
Having a large domestic maker of batteries means carmakers won't have to import them and face hefty E.U. tariffs or the high costs of transporting the equipment. Until now, Britain's only other battery facility was one linked to the country's largest car plant, operated by Nissan in northeast England.
Tata was recently reported to be considering building its battery plant in Spain, but such a move would have put Jaguar Land Rover's cars made in Britain at a disadvantage. The site ultimately selected is likely to be in Somerset.
Mr. Sunak came up with an offer that would allay fears of losing one the country's largest auto manufacturers. Grant Shapps, the British energy security secretary, told the BBC that the deal was "hard won." He declined to say how much in aid and subsidies Tata had been offered; the government said it would publish those details "in due course."
In a news release issued by the British government, Natarajan Chandrasekaran, Tata's chairman, said he wanted "to thank His Majesty's government, which has worked so closely with us to enable this investment."
Jaguar Land Rover produced nearly 203,000 vehicles in Britain last year, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, making it the country's second-largest automaker after Nissan. Overall, the number of cars produced in Britain has fallen sharply, to 775,000 last year from a peak of more than 1.7 million in 2016.
In the race for battery manufacturers to support carmakers, Britain is competing against the United States, which offers substantial subsidies to battery makers, and the European Union.
While car manufacturing in Britain has been in decline since 2016, coinciding with the vote to leave the European Union, it remains important to the economy, employing 182,000 people, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Eight of 10 cars made in Britain are exported, with nearly 60 percent of those going to the European Union.
Tata is already heavily invested in various businesses in Britain. Along with Jaguar Land Rover, the company has substantial steel operations, including a large mill in Wales. The company has been talking with the government about financial aid to convert the plant's operations to produce steel with fewer carbon emissions.
In his statement, Mr. Chandrasekaran said Tata's decision to invest in the battery plant "strengthens its commitment to the U.K."

We May Not Be Ready for an All-E.V. World: [Op-Ed]

Full text: I get why the Biden administration is pushing electric vehicles so hard. To stop the planet from overheating, we'll eventually need motor vehicles to produce zero greenhouse gas emissions, and only fully electric vehicles can do that. Hybrids, which have combustion engines along with electric motors, will always puff some carbon dioxide (and other bad stuff) out of their tailpipes.
Right now, though, there's a good argument to be made that the government, and automakers, are leaning too hard into all-electric and neglecting the virtues of hybrid technology. When I first heard this counterintuitive argument from Toyota, I dismissed it as heel-dragging by a company that lags in electrics, but I've come around to the idea that hybrids -- at least for now -- do have a lot of advantages over all-electric vehicles.
Imagine some wheelbarrows filled with rocks. The rocks contain lithium, cobalt, manganese, nickel, graphite and other materials for lithium-ion batteries. By Toyota's calculation, the amount of rocks needed for one long-range electric vehicle would be enough for either six plug-in hybrids or 90 of the type of hybrid that can't be plugged in for a recharge. (Namely, the type whose batteries are recharged from the engine or from braking.)
"The overall carbon reduction of those 90 hybrids over their lifetimes is 37 times as much as a single battery electric vehicle," Toyota argues. That's a stunning statistic if true.
"People involved in the auto industry are largely a silent majority," Toyota's then chief executive, Akio Toyoda, told reporters on a trip to Thailand in December, according to The Wall Street Journal. "That silent majority is wondering whether E.V.s are really OK to have as a single option. But they think it's the trend so they can't speak out loudly."
Lobbying against an all-electric approach is what you might expect from an automaker that bet heavily on hydrogen fuel cells and hybrids and has only a sliver of the market in E.V.s that run on batteries. I have no doubt that Toyota is motivated at least in part by self-interest. But some people I spoke with who aren't connected with the company had similar views.
"Toyota's claim is accurate. We've crunched the numbers on this," Ashley Nunes told me. He is a senior research associate at Harvard Law School and the director for federal policy, climate and energy at the Breakthrough Institute, a think tank. He testified on the topic in April before the House Subcommittee on Environment, Manufacturing and Critical Materials.
I'll speed through his points. Electric vehicles consume huge quantities of lithium and other materials because they have huge batteries. And they have huge batteries because customers suffer from "range anxiety" and won't buy an E.V. unless it can go for hundreds of miles without charging -- even though the vast majority of trips are short. The Nissan Leaf gets 149 miles with its standard battery, which seems like enough for most purposes, yet Nissan sold just 12,026 Leafs (Leaves?) last year.
Partly because of ever-bigger batteries, E.V.s are getting more expensive on average, not cheaper as was predicted. They are out of many buyers' price range. Some people will keep driving old ICE-mobiles (cars with internal combustion engines) because they can't afford an E.V. And those ICE-mobiles will continue to be major emitters of greenhouse gases.
The production of electric vehicles produces more greenhouse gases than the production of cars with combustion engines. So E.V.s have to travel between 28,000 and 68,000 miles before they have an emissions advantage over similarly sized and equipped ICE-mobiles, according to Nunes. That may take 10 years or more if the E.V. isn't driven much.
Then there's the problem of where to get all the minerals. Domestic production, even combined with extensive recycling, can't meet the need for cobalt, graphite, lithium and manganese, Nunes wrote in his prepared House testimony. Allies could help, but they're also ramping up consumption. "There is, to put it bluntly, only so much mineral supply to go around," he wrote. Lithium iron phosphate is a promising alternative battery chemistry, but its energy density is lower, so batteries would have to be even bigger to give the same range. (Sodium-ion batteries and solid-state lithium-ion batteries are other options.)
The Biden administration clearly doesn't trust electric vehicles to win over the buying public purely on their merits. That's why in April the Environmental Protection Agency proposed new rules to ensure that two-thirds of new passenger cars and a quarter of new heavy trucks sold in the United States are all-electric by 2032.
That would be a wrenching change. It sometimes seems like E.V.s are everywhere, but in reality they accounted for just 5.8 percent of new cars sold in the United States last year, The Times reported. All-electric trucks accounted for less than 2 percent of new heavy trucks.
Of course, drivers could be bribed into buying E.V.s if enough money were thrust in their faces. But Nunes said that greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced far more cost-effectively through subsidies of clean power generation, particularly wind turbines.
For another perspective, I exchanged emails with Nafisa Lohawala, a Ph.D. economist who is a fellow at Resources for the Future, a think tank. She focused on the benefits of plug-in hybrids, which use less metal than all-electric E.V.s but more than non-pluggable hybrids. "From consumers' perspective," she wrote, "having a gasoline backup helps alleviate range anxiety, allowing them to adopt plug-in hybrids even when the charging network around them is sparse. Moreover, given their lower price, middle- and low-income communities would also find adopting them easier than battery electric vehicles."
Lohawala wrote that if drivers recharge their plug-in hybrids frequently, they'll be able to run on battery power almost all the time and emissions will be almost as low as with an all-electric E.V. That will tend to happen as more charging stations with faster chargers are installed. "As long as the battery ranges of plug-in hybrids are reasonably long and the electricity prices are low, consumers would voluntarily charge them rather than relying on gasoline," she wrote.
Again, I get that climate change is an existential crisis. (Take it from my Opinion colleague, David Wallace-Wells.) I also get that hybrids aren't as clean as all-electric E.V.s. "The fact is: A hybrid today is not green technology," Katherine García, the director of the Clean Transportation for All Campaign, wrote last year. "The Prius hybrid runs on a pollution-emitting combustion engine found in any gas-powered car."
However, getting to the destination of all-electric for all will take more minerals, better battery chemistry and more and better chargers, among other things. That's a big project. For now, hybrids seem like a valuable part of the vehicle mix.
The Readers Write
Amazon is in a world of hurt. They entered an established category (groceries) with entrenched competitors, including Walmart. I like to compare the position Amazon is in to that of the French forces at Dien Bien Phu in 1954. The French thought they had a superior army. The Viet Minh placed their focus on having a superior strategy. The French forces had to surrender.

ROLLING FORK, Miss. — Two years into their marriage, Talia and Malissa Williams were working diligently to lay the groundwork for the rest of their lives together. Both were taking online college classes that could lead to stable careers. They had taken tentative steps toward adopting a child.
The couple had talked about settling permanently in Rolling Fork, the tiny Mississippi Delta hometown that Malissa Williams had followed Talia back to a few years earlier. But the medical billing and coding jobs they’d been studying for weren’t likely to be found within an hour’s drive. Their older wooden house — essentially their least worst option in a town with a limited supply of rental housing — gave them nothing but problems.
Then came the tornado.
The house, gone. Their possessions — cars, clothes, computers — eviscerated in winds that reached 170 mph as the storm, the deadliest to hit Mississippi in more than a decade, tore through on the night of March 24.
Gone, too, was any incentive for them to stay.
“My heart is in Rolling Fork; it will always be there,” Talia Williams, 42, said as she stood outside the motel room, a 45-minute drive away, that is serving as the couple’s temporary home. “But now this has happened, we have an opportunity,” she said.
As powerful storms raked across the Southeast on that night in March, Rolling Fork was shredded. Sixteen people were killed in the area. Dozens of families were forced into the same position as Talia and Malissa Williams: Their homes were mangled, their lives upended in an instant.
But just like Talia and Malissa Williams, many people in the community had already been navigating a slower-motion crisis for years, one that has swept the whole of the Mississippi Delta over decades of disinvestment and decline.
The devastation of this other disaster is manifest in the decaying homes and abandoned storefronts in the few areas of Rolling Fork left unscathed by the tornado, as well as in the city’s neglected infrastructure, entrenched poverty, struggling schools and troubling health statistics. The population of about 1,700 has been shrinking steadily for as long as most residents can remember.
“We were struggling to rebuild the town before the tornado,” said Angela Hall Williams, a longtime resident. She ticked off some of the things that had disappeared from Rolling Fork long before the storm, including decent-paying jobs, thriving stores and any evidence of bustle.
The Delta — a pancake-flat expanse wedged between the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers in the northwestern part of the state — has long been defined by a contradiction. It is known for having some of the most fertile soil in the world, sustaining cotton, soybean and corn crops that for generations have been distributed around the world. But the bounty has rarely been shared in any meaningful way with the African American families who make up much of the population in the impoverished, hollowed-out communities that speckle the region, like Rolling Fork.
“You still see the vestiges of racial segregation, of economic segregation,” said Rolando Herts, the director of the Delta Center for Culture and Learning at Delta State University, in Cleveland, Mississippi. “We’re inheriting the decisions that were made years and years, decades and decades ago.”
The most viable solution for many Delta residents has been to leave. That was the case during the Great Migration, the mass exodus from the South of African Americans fleeing racist oppression and poverty during the 20th century. The population drain continued as increased mechanization of farming reduced the need for farm laborers and other types of industry fled the region.
Annie Lee Reed, 69, spent most of her life in Rolling Fork, but she was relieved when her children left town. The distance was difficult, but the alternative was worse. If they stayed, she said, “I knew they weren’t going to do nothing or make nothing.”
There are those who believe the tornado was not a nudge to flee, but an opportunity for Rolling Fork. In the immediate aftermath, Mayor Eldridge Walker assured the community that the city would “come back bigger and better than ever before.”
His argument was that the storm had drawn attention — and the prospect of investment — to the town. If not for the tornado, President Joe Biden would never have flown in and promised the support of his administration. “Good Morning America” would never have broadcast live from Rolling Fork or solicited donations for the town from viewers.
As clear-eyed as Hall Williams was about what ailed Rolling Fork, she was among those who saw promise in the town. “It’s coming back,” she said confidently.
Her home was severely damaged by the storm, leaving Hall Williams and her husband to stay in a motel outside of town. But she was sketching out plans to open a restaurant serving her favorites: macaroni and cheese, catfish, brisket. She would be an employer, someone helping Rolling Fork survive, giving others incentive and resources to stay put.
“I’m not giving up,” Hall Williams said.
Henry Hood was far less sanguine. Two months after the tornado, the attention to the town had already faded. Assurances from elected officials were followed by a formal process for seeking government assistance that was so thick with bureaucratic and other hurdles that even the best of intentions were no match.
So far, he and Reed, his wife, had gotten $650 in federal emergency aid to fix a damaged car and $1,200 from a church to repair their house, which had been handed down from Reed’s parents.
“It’s just going to be patched back up, little by little,” Hood said of his home. “There’s not going to be a remodeling and all that.”
His prediction: The same would be true for Rolling Fork.
The community was daunted by a bleak catalog of destruction: City Hall, the post office, the police department, both laundromats, the Family Dollar store, the convenience store that also had a decent menu of hot food.
There were also things that, while not essential to a functioning community, held deep value as the landmarks of home. Domonique Smith, who grew up in Rolling Fork, noticed the loss of the pear tree in the yard of a woman known as Miss Louise, which had long been harvested by neighborhood children.
Smith’s mother’s house had seemingly vaporized, its contents spread across the neighborhood. She found a single photograph of her father, who died when she was so young that she had no memories of him. A neighbor found a photo of Smith in her cap and gown, from when she was the valedictorian of her class at South Delta High School.
Now 35, she lives in Jackson, the state capital, almost 90 minutes away. But she said she had always found comfort in knowing her mother’s house, a safe haven, was there in Rolling Fork.
She returned to Rolling Fork on a recent Sunday because her family, at last, had something to celebrate. Her cousin, Ja’kiya Powell, had just graduated from high school, third in her class. The family gathered in another relative’s front yard, boasting of Powell’s accomplishment with a banner hanging from the front of the house.
Almost a year ago, Powell’s mother had moved to Texas, but Powell stayed behind, living with relatives. She wanted a normal senior year with her friends, something different from her school experience during the pandemic. The tornado hit the town just before her prom.
She was preparing to follow her mother and cousin out of Rolling Fork, starting at the University of Mississippi in the fall.
“There was a little taste of something before the tornado,” Powell, 18, said of her hometown. “Ain’t nothing now.”
A shadow Rolling Fork has sprouted in the collection of motels on Route 82 in Greenville, about 40 miles away, where the Red Cross is still distributing three meals a day and a shuttle bus totes residents back to town to clean up their property or just to be close to whatever is left of home.
Talia and Malissa Williams have mostly stuck to their room on the first floor of the Days Inn, which they share with Pee Wee, an ancient yet remarkably spry Chihuahua, and Bailey, a much younger pit bull.
They are waiting for government aid and possible temporary housing — a runway allowing them to save money and plot a future far from Rolling Fork. Talia Williams still works as a home caregiver.
“It’s basically God,” Malissa Williams, 43, said. “Wherever his direction is leading us, that’s where we’re going.”
Maybe it will be Tupelo, a city of 37,000 outside the Delta. Memphis, three hours north, could be an option, or somewhere in Texas, where Malissa Williams’ brother lives.
In the quiet moments, an odd thought keeps surfacing. It is uncomfortable to articulate, given the heartache that surrounds the couple and all the disruption to their own lives. But that does not make it any less true.
“To me, it’s beautiful,” Malissa Williams said. “I don’t know what else to say about it.”
There was the Nissan sedan parked outside their motel room, which they called their blessing. There were generous strangers, like the woman Malissa Williams had met shopping at the Goodwill store in Greenville. The woman handed Malissa $60, then pulled it back and said God had commanded her to offer a $100 bill instead.
Malissa Williams even found gratitude for the storm that had destroyed her home. It was the shove she and her wife needed, sending them toward the possibility of something better, somewhere else.

Ford's U.S. Sales Rose 10% in Second Quarter
Ford Motor said Thursday that its new-vehicle sales rose 10 percent in the three months of April through June, thanks to robust demand for trucks. The automaker sold 531,662 motor vehicles, up from 483,688 in the second quarter last year, as sales of pickups, delivery vans and heavy trucks increased 26 percent. The gain in truck sales more than offset a decline of nearly 3 percent in sales of electric vehicles. Ford sold 14,843 battery-powered cars and trucks in the quarter, down from 15,273 a year earlier. It has had to slow production to upgrade assembly lines. The upgrade work mainly affected the Mustang Mach-E, whose sales declined 21 percent in the second quarter. Ford also sold 4,466 F-150 Lightning electric pickup trucks in the quarter. That was more than double the total from a year earlier and the second-highest quarterly total since the truck went on sale. On Wednesday, General Motors, Honda, Nissan, Hyundai and Kia reported increases of 14 percent or more. Overall, automakers sold more than 4.1 million cars and trucks in the second quarter, according to Cox Automotive, a market research firm, an increase of 16 percent from a year earlier. The total, however, was about 400,000 fewer cars than the industry typically sold in the second quarter before the coronavirus pandemic. Sales remain below their prepandemic levels because parts shortages have forced automakers to produce fewer vehicles for much of the last three years. The supply of computer chips, which have been particularly hard to get, has improved in recent months. NEAL E. BOUDETTE

Amazon's iRobot Deal Is in E.U.'s Cross Hairs
Amazon's $ 1.7 billion acquisition of iRobot may reduce competition and strengthen Amazon's position as an online marketplace provider, European Union antitrust regulators warned on Thursday. The European Commission opened a full-scale investigation and will decide by Nov. 15 whether to clear or block the deal for iRobot, the robot vacuum cleaner maker. "We continue to work through the process with the European Commission and are focused on addressing its questions and any identified concerns at this stage," an Amazon spokesperson said. Antitrust enforcers around the world have increased scrutiny of Big Tech acquiring smaller rivals, concerned about the accumulation of data by a few companies, and big players leveraging their dominance into new markets. The acquisition announced last August that it would add iRobot's Roomba robot vacuum to Amazon's portfolio of smart devices, which include the Alexa voice assistant, smart thermostats, security devices and wall-mounted smart displays. IRobot made its first Roomba robot vacuum in 2002. Amazon has previously said the vacuum cleaner market is very competitive, with lots of Chinese players. "The commission is concerned that the transaction would allow Amazon to restrict competition in the market for robot vacuum cleaners and to strengthen its position as online marketplace provider," an E.U. executive said. The Amazon spokesperson also said the company could "offer a company like iRobot the resources to accelerate innovation and invest in critical features while lowering prices for consumers." REUTERS

Higher Tech Raises Cost To Fix Cars: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: More technology and creature comforts, as well as a parade of new electric vehicles, have complicated the job after accidents.
New cars and trucks are packed with sensors and technology that protect and pamper drivers and passengers. But those features are also raising the cost of repairs after accidents.
The average cost of making damaged cars good as new has soared 36 percent since 2018, and may top $ 5,000 by the end of this year, according to Mitchell, a company that provides data and software to insurance companies and auto repair businesses. That big increase is the main reason that insurance premiums have been soaring -- up 17 percent in the 12 months through May.
New sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, including a rapidly growing number of electric models, have become so complex and luxurious that seemingly simple repairs can cost a small fortune, auto experts said. Insurers are often on the hook for much of those costs, leading them to raise their rates.
Materials designed to crumple or deform in a crash to protect pedestrians or passengers, for example, can be hard or impossible to repair. Many bumpers must be replaced after low-speed dings because the safety sensors embedded in them may no longer work properly after repairs. Other systems, even some that do not appear to be damaged, must be inspected or recalibrated.
"The modern digital architecture is so advanced that systems beyond point of impact are being disrupted," said Ryan Mandell, director of claims performance for Mitchell. "Getting a car back to pre-loss condition is harder than at any point in history, and will only become more challenging."
Industry experts have been particularly focused on the cost of repairing electric cars and trucks, which aren't built like gasoline cars and have different parts. In addition, many mechanics aren't trained to work on them. In recent months, news reports and stories shared on social media about astronomical repair bills for electric cars and trucks have captured the attention of car enthusiasts.
Consider the case of Chris Apfelstadt and his Rivian R1T pickup truck, which was rear-ended by a Lexus in February at a stoplight in Columbus, Ohio, while he was driving and his infant son was in the back seat.
The damage was initially deemed relatively minor, and the other driver's insurer offered him $ 1,600. The actual cost to fix the bumper at a business certified to repair Rivian vehicles -- one of just three in Ohio -- was $ 42,000, roughly half the truck's selling price.
"I expected it to be expensive," said Mr. Apfelstadt, who owns a lighting company, "but it was still a shocking number."
A key reason is that the accident damaged a sleek panel that extends from the truck's rear to front roof pillars. Repairing and repainting it set off a cascade of pricey work, including removing the interior ceiling material, known as the headliner, and front windshield.
Some of the cost probably also had to do with Rivian's small size and youth. Like other auto start-ups, the company, which is based in Irvine, Calif., and delivered its first vehicles to customers in 2021, does not sell through franchised dealers and has had to build an independent repair network from scratch.
Ford Motor has 2,800 North American dealers equipped to repair its electric vehicles, along with a vast network of independent shops and aftermarket suppliers. Rivian has certified about 200 North American collision shops.
"It's a challenge that we're newer to market," said Noe Mejia, Rivian's vice president of service operations. But, he added, Rivian's smaller scale and lack of bureaucracy allow it to work directly with customers and shops to ensure repairs meet high standards.
Mr. Apfelstadt's story was discussed extensively on the internet. To some people, accounts such as his, and harrowing tales of cars totaled after minor accidents shared online by some owners of Tesla cars, have become cautionary tales about the financial perils of owning electric cars.
Auto experts acknowledge that repairing electric models is more expensive on average than repairing gasoline vehicles. But a fuller analysis of claims and repair data shows that electric vehicle repair costs are not markedly higher than costs for gasoline cars of similar age and price, and that they're sometimes less.
"The idea that E.V.s are being totaled left and right is the horror story that keeps insurers up at night," Mr. Mandell said. "Has that happened? Yes. But the incidents are few and far between."
Data from Mitchell shows that in 2022 electric vehicles cost about $ 6,800 on average to fix after accidents, about $ 2,400 more than the average for all cars. Battery-powered cars tend to require more expensive parts, the company said, and repairing them takes more time and may require work by specialist mechanics.
But a big reason electric cars tend to cost much more to repair, at first glance, is that most of them are newer luxury models. Tesla's cars, which sell for between $ 40,000 and around $ 110,000, account for 75 percent of collision claims for battery-powered models.
Fixing electric vehicles from mainstream brands such as Hyundai or Nissan costs only about $ 800 more than their gasoline counterparts, according to Mitchell. And in the premium segment, typical repair costs for battery-powered and gasoline vehicles are roughly the same, around $ 7,000, for model years 2018 and later.
Other data suggests that electric vehicles fare relatively well. About 18 percent of gasoline cars involved in crashes are totaled, while only about 6 percent of battery-powered vehicles are deemed unrepairable after accidents, according to Mitchell.
Matt Moore, a senior vice president at the Highway Loss Data Institute, a research organization that serves the insurance industry, said insurance and repair data undercut the idea that batteries or electric technology racked up burdensome repair costs. For 11 models that are available in gasoline and electric versions -- including the Hyundai Kona and Volvo XC40 -- repair costs for the electric models are just 2 percent higher, according to the institute's analysis.
Gasoline or electric, Mr. Moore said, more expensive, rare and higher-performing cars tend to be involved in fewer but more severe accidents in part because they are more likely to be driven by people who speed and take other risks.
"They hit fast and hit hard," he said. "Every collision is a mix of man and machine."
But auto experts added that damage to the battery pack of electric cars -- their most expensive part -- could make them harder to repair, requiring special tools and advanced training.
"Right now, if there's serious damage to the pack, nobody is anxious to take a shot at repairing that," said Sandy Munro, an engineer and consultant who hosts a popular YouTube show on which he has interviewed Elon Musk, the Tesla chief executive, and others in the auto industry.
Automakers say they are aware of rising repair costs and are working to make cars easier to fix, especially electric vehicles, which many executives expect to replace most or all gasoline models in the coming decades.
BMW has equipped its electric vehicles with sensors that provide data on crash-force direction and intensity. That information can guide technicians on which battery modules need replacement. Ford has made it so its dealers can replace a damaged battery tray on the Mustang Mach-E and swap all components into a new tray. General Motors is developing a process to let dealers repair and replace packs, including individual battery modules that are damaged.
Even though repair costs are climbing, Mr. Munro emphasized that newer cars provided significant benefits over older vehicles. They can absorb horrifying crash forces and let occupants walk away. Or they avoid collisions entirely, using the same cameras and sensors that make for trickier repairs.
"If nobody dies but we can't fix that bumper, I don't care about that," he said. "It's only scrap iron. The focus is rightly on the people inside and the efficiency of the car."

Apfelstadt’s story was discussed extensively on the internet. To some people, accounts such as his, and harrowing tales of cars totaled after minor accidents shared online by some owners of Tesla cars, have become cautionary tales about the financial perils of owning electric cars.
Auto experts acknowledge that repairing electric models is more expensive on average than repairing gasoline vehicles. But a fuller analysis of claims and repair data shows that electric vehicle repair costs are not markedly higher than costs for gasoline cars of similar age and price, and that they’re sometimes less.
“The idea that EVs are being totaled left and right is the horror story that keeps insurers up at night,” Mandell said. “Has that happened? Yes. But the incidents are few and far between.”
Data from Mitchell shows that in 2022 electric vehicles cost about $6,800 on average to fix after accidents, about $2,400 more than the average for all cars. Battery-powered cars tend to require more expensive parts, the company said, and repairing them takes more time and may require work by specialist mechanics.
But a big reason electric cars tend to cost much more to repair, at first glance, is that most of them are newer luxury models. Tesla’s cars, which sell for between $40,000 and around $110,000, account for 75% of collision claims for battery-powered models.
Fixing electric vehicles from mainstream brands such as Hyundai or Nissan costs only about $800 more than their gasoline counterparts, according to Mitchell. And in the premium segment, typical repair costs for battery-powered and gasoline vehicles are roughly the same, around $7,000, for model years 2018 and later.
Other data suggests that electric vehicles fare relatively well. About 18% of gasoline cars involved in crashes are totaled, while only about 6% of battery-powered vehicles are deemed unrepairable after accidents, according to Mitchell.
Matt Moore, a senior vice president at the Highway Loss Data Institute, a research organization that serves the insurance industry, said insurance and repair data undercut the idea that batteries or electric technology racked up burdensome repair costs. For 11 models that are available in gasoline and electric versions — including the Hyundai Kona and Volvo XC40 — repair costs for the electric models are just 2% higher, according to the institute’s analysis.
Gasoline or electric, Moore said, more expensive, rare and higher-performing cars tend to be involved in fewer but more severe accidents in part because they are more likely to be driven by people who speed and take other risks.
“They hit fast and hit hard,” he said. “Every collision is a mix of man and machine.”
But auto experts added that damage to the battery pack of electric cars — their most expensive part — could make them harder to repair, requiring special tools and advanced training.
“Right now, if there’s serious damage to the pack, nobody is anxious to take a shot at repairing that,” said Sandy Munro, an engineer and consultant who hosts a popular YouTube show on which he has interviewed Elon Musk, the Tesla CEO, and others in the auto industry.
Automakers say they are aware of rising repair costs and are working to make cars easier to fix, especially electric vehicles, which many executives expect to replace most or all gasoline models in the coming decades.
BMW has equipped its electric vehicles with sensors that provide data on crash-force direction and intensity. That information can guide technicians on which battery modules need replacement. Ford has made it so its dealers can replace a damaged battery tray on the Mustang Mach-E and swap all components into a new tray. General Motors is developing a process to let dealers repair and replace packs, including individual battery modules that are damaged.
Even though repair costs are climbing, Munro emphasized that newer cars provided significant benefits over older vehicles. They can absorb horrifying crash forces and let occupants walk away. Or they avoid collisions entirely, using the same cameras and sensors that make for trickier repairs.
“If nobody dies but we can’t fix that bumper, I don’t care about that,” he said. “It’s only scrap iron. The focus is rightly on the people inside and the efficiency of the car.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An innovative E.V. ride-sharing program is bringing low-cost clean transportation to an agricultural town in California's Central Valley. Others are following suit.
Three mornings a week, Herminia Ibarra makes her way to a fleet of sparkling electric vehicles lined up in a dusty alley alongside a former diesel repair shop. Of the five Chevy Bolts, three Tesla Ys, two Volkswagen e-Golfs and a BMW i3, she always tries to snag her favorite: the red Bolt set up with her Bluetooth. In this E.V., she will pick up the two retired farmworkers who are her regular clients and ferry them on two-lane roads to their dialysis appointments 20 miles away.
Ms. Ibarra is a raitera, a term for the practice of neighbors providing rides to community members in need. The shop, which has a Mexican flag wrapped around its staircase, is the nerve center of Green Raiteros, an E.V. ride-sharing initiative in Huron, Calif., that shuttles low-income residents, many of them elderly, to medical appointments for free.
Ms. Ibarra, behind the wheel of the red Bolt, is what its proponents call "mobility justice" in action: an effort to address the reality that low-income communities most affected by pollution from diesel trucks, highways and other sources have had the least access to zero-emission vehicles.
Enter the Green Raiteros. Born of a lack of public transit, a concern for the environment and stubborn resolve, the program was masterminded by the Latino Equity Advocacy & Policy Institute, a nonprofit founded by Rey León, Huron's mayor.
Similar efforts are underway elsewhere in California, New York and other areas, along with a growing push in Washington, D.C., to subsidize E.V. programs. Under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the federal government is providing $ 700 million in grants to local governments to set up charging infrastructure in underserved areas.
The goal of all these initiatives is to give more people in low-income communities access to cleaner forms of transportation. In Huron, the result of the local effort is 30 charging stations placed strategically around the city, among other projects aimed at lowering carbon emissions in the area.
Ringed by vast acres of garlic and tomato fields, Huron is a small agricultural city in "the Heart of the Valley," as a sign on the main road into town announces. Of Huron's 6,200 residents, 95 percent are Latino and about 50 percent are immigrants. And despite being just 50 miles from Fresno, the state's fifth largest city, Huron is too remote for Uber or Lyft to operate.
Mr. León has referred to the tradition of ride sharing in Latino communities as "Indigenous Ubers." He is the son of a migrant worker brought to the U.S. under the Bracero program that ran from 1942 to 1964, and a graduate of University of California, Berkeley. The emotional resonance of ride-sharing came early: When Mr. León was a child, his uncle worked as a raitero. "He was a tall man with a big sombrero and a tiny car -- a green Pinto," he recalled. "He was like Curious George with the Man with the big Yellow Hat. Big guy, small car."
When Mr. León's uncle wasn't available, the family's transit options were limited. Mr. León remembers that he and his mother had to take the county bus to visit a critically injured cousin in the hospital some 55 miles away, an exhausting three-and-a-half-hour journey with at least 16 stops.
For Mr. León, the ordeal from his youth laid the groundwork for Green Raiteros. Electric vehicles that usually zip around the dappled hills of wealthy Malibu or Marin County are now accessible to "maintainers of the food chain," as Mr. León describes his majority farmworker residents.
Huron's average household income is $ 35,000, and many people, Mr. León said, spend 30 to 40 percent of their monthly wages on gas-powered cars that frequently break down. Residents breathe air consistently ranked as some of the country's worst.
"Like affordable housing, mobility and transportation are a basic human right," said Ethan Elkind, director of the climate program for the Center for Law, Energy & the Environment at University of California Berkeley law school. In low-income, ecologically vulnerable areas like Huron, he said that it often requires multiple sources of public funding to get the necessary infrastructure up and running -- charging stations especially -- including staff to apply for the grants in the first place.
Mr. León launched Green Raiteros in 2018 with private foundation money and half a million dollars from the settlement of a legal case between NRG Energy and the California Public Utilities Commission. The Teslas were courtesy of a $ 1 million grant from the California Air Resources Board, the state air quality regulator charged with developing programs to fight climate change. (A statute requires that at least 35 percent of certain climate investment projects benefit low-income communities and households.) The $ 150,000 annual operating budget is largely a mix of funding from the air board, state agencies and philanthropies, supplemented by a recent contribution from General Motors."It's always about playing catch-up," Mr. León said.
Tax credits and consumer rebates for purchasing E.V.s tend to be of little use for people for whom owning a car is a significant financial hurdle. "Owning a car is a poverty perpetuator," Mr. León observed, sitting in the Green Raiteros dispatch center behind the faded brown stucco colonnades of the main street.
Ms. Ibarra, like some Green Raiteros drivers, started out as a client. Her husband, Victor Garcia, worked as an agricultural truck driver and needed access to the sole family car, so Ms. Ibarra relied on raiteros to get around. Gregorio Hernandez, 69, one of her regulars and a retired farmworker, was an original "green raitero" but became unable to drive after two strokes. He usually rides in Ms. Ibarra's Bolt along with Enrique Contreras, a fellow dialysis patient who said it would otherwise cost $ 40 a day to pay someone to drive him.
Ms. Ibarra's route to the dialysis center is a slice of Central Valley life, bisecting miles of pistachio and almond orchards, and cotton fields shedding fluff along the shoulders. She passes local employers like a major state prison and the sweltering tomato paste processing plant where she used to work. In the car, the three chitchat about what's growing, the job scene in the fields and, of course, the weather. Ms. Ibarra always waits for the two men to finish their dialysis appointments, then drives them home.
She cares about the planet but likes E.V.s chiefly because she hates pumping gas, she said. She tracks mileage on her iPhone, pulling up to a charger at day's end. At night, the program's cars reside behind a chain-link fence guarded by two pit bulls, Princess and Puki.
"It's important because many people don't drive, don't have cars and there is nobody to take them," Ms. Ibarra said. "They are all farmworkers and would have to lose a day of work."
Green Raitero's clients, about 120 in total, either sign up for rides in advance or just wander into the former repair shop. Many "still have old-fashioned flip phones," said David Mercado, the dispatcher and a longtime driver. "They can call day or night. We're a tight community."
Inventive models for E.V. ride sharing are flourishing elsewhere, from rural, unincorporated communities outside Fresno to a new car-sharing program bringing E.V.s to affordable housing complexes in eight states. A pioneering public-private effort in Los Angeles, BlueLA powered by Blink Mobility, began in 2015 with funding from California Air Resources Board and the city's Department of Water and Power. It offers car sharing at discounted rates for low-income members: $ 1 per month for membership and 15 cents a minute in rental fees.
At Rancho San Pedro, a largely Latino public housing complex abutting the heavily polluted, highly trafficked Port of Los Angeles, residents campaigned for a $ 100,000 state-funded pilot launched by the nonprofit Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator to bring two electric vehicles and charging stations to this transportation desert more than 20 miles from downtown.
The communal Nissan Leafs, renting for $ 5 an hour, have been a hit with residents, with prime time starting at 6 a.m. for school drop-offs. "If the car breaks down, you don't have to repair it," said Maria Montes, who coaches others on how to use the E.V. sharing program.
Other E.V. pilots, like the nonprofit Miocar, based at affordable housing developments throughout the Central Valley, have relied on public investments.
The most far-reaching concept is the country's first municipally owned car share, in Minneapolis and Saint Paul, Minn., a fleet of 170 electric vehicles and 70 charging spots covering a 35 square-mile area with a high concentration of poverty. Evie Carshare debuted last year, subsidized by $ 7 million in federal grants, $ 4 million from Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy Inc. and funding from both cities.
But collectively, these nonprofit programs face broader hurdles. Because they offer below-market pricing, their long-term financial sustainability and ability to scale up can be uncertain. "It's an inversion of the dominant car-sharing model, which is a for-profit operation in affluent urban areas with high-quality transit," said Caroline Rodier, associate director of the Urban Land Use and Transportation Center at UC Davis, who has studied Miocar and rural car sharing.
Obtaining auto insurance can also be a struggle, said Creighton Randall, the chief executive of the Mobility Development Group, which specializes in launching such projects.
Ithaca Carshare in upstate New York, which has operated for 15 years with 30 cars and 1,500 members, recently went on hiatus after the two remaining private insurers of car sharing left the New York market. Last week, the state passed legislation allowing nonprofits to pool insurance, allowing programs like the one in Ithaca to secure affordable plans and continue operating.
And in Cantua Creek, Calif., a tiny Central Valley town (population 471), the much-anticipated arrival of four E.V.s and six chargers in November 2019 through a state program was short-lived. The cars were put on hold at the start of the pandemic and later unceremoniously removed.
Poetically named "Van Y Vienen" (meaning "they come and go"), community members could volunteer as drivers through an app set up by Green Commuter, a private ride-sharing company. For residents like Rosario Rodriguez, 47, who lives in neighboring Three Rocks and does not drive, this was a huge relief.
The $ 1.9 million project included $ 749,800 in California air board funding. Its demise "speaks to the larger issue of how we invest in public transit that goes beyond traditional projects," said Veronica Garibay, co-executive director of Leadership Counsel for Justice & Accountability, a legal and social justice organization that works with low-income, rural communities.
The cars provided residents with a fleeting glimpse of independence. "They were rides with people I could trust," Ms. Rodriguez said, citing easy trips to her mammograms, dental appointments and food shopping in Fresno, 50 miles away. "Then one day, the cars were gone."
"To tell you the truth, I just feel helpless and disappointed," she said. "It's not a privilege or a luxury to have a form of transportation. It is a need."

How Detectives Broke a Logjam In Four Student Deaths in Idaho: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In the weeks after four University of Idaho students were found slaughtered in a house near campus last November, a growing roster of investigators desperately searching for answers had yet to identify a suspect or even find the murder weapon.
Publicly, the authorities were assuring worried residents in the small college town that they were making progress. Privately, they were exhausting their prospects, scouring through the backgrounds of those with the thinnest possible connections to the case.
Through the first two weeks of December, investigators put some of their focus on classmates of the victims; they also widened the search to examine a man in another state who had been known to send harassing messages to women but had visited Idaho only twice in his life. They looked at a woman previously charged with assaults in the region. They looked at a man once accused of wielding a knife. They looked at sex offenders. They looked at a white supremacist. Each turned out to be a dead end.
Then, after spending weeks sifting through an array of evidence that seemed to lead nowhere, investigators announced an arrest in late December on the other side of the country: Bryan Kohberger, a Ph.D. student from a nearby university. He was identified only after investigators turned to an advanced method of DNA analysis that had rarely been used in active murder investigations.
The story of how dozens of officers from local, state and federal agencies took the quadruple murder investigation into extraordinary territory is only now becoming more apparent, through recently obtained records and interviews with people familiar with the investigation who discussed key details that emerged before the issuance of a gag order in the case.
The case has shown the degree to which law enforcement investigators have come to rely on the digital footprints that ordinary Americans leave in nearly every facet of their lives. Online shopping, car sales, carrying a cellphone, drives along city streets and amateur genealogy all played roles in an investigation that was solved, in the end, as much through technology as traditional sleuthing.
Now indicted on four counts of murder, Mr. Kohberger has declined to enter a plea but contended previously through his lawyer that he would be exonerated. Investigators have yet to detail a possible motive: To this day, family members of the victims remain unaware of any prior connections that the accused killer had with the four young people who were killed.
The process of identifying and arresting a suspect took over six weeks -- weeks of increasing frustration and painstaking examination of evidence as the community pushed for answers.
The first 911 call came in around noon, some seven hours after the murders. Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20, had been stabbed to death overnight in their bedrooms. Initially, the Moscow Police Department described the attack as "targeted" and assured residents that there was no risk to the public. But with no indication of who had committed the attack or why, the authorities eventually backtracked.
"We cannot say that there is no threat to the community," the police chief, James Fry, said at a news conference on Nov. 16, three days after the killings.
The department, which had only a few dozen officers, enlisted the Idaho State Police and the F.B.I. to help, bringing in dozens of additional investigators. Forensic teams processed evidence from the bedrooms, snapped photos around the home's back door and hunted for footprints; others searched for surveillance video from around town.
A week after the killings, records show, investigators were on the lookout for a certain type of vehicle: Nissan Sentras from the model years 2019 to 2023. Quietly, they ran down details on thousands of such vehicles, including the owners' addresses, license plate numbers and the color of each sedan.
But further scrutiny of the video footage produced more clarity, and on Nov. 25 the police in Moscow asked law enforcement agencies to look for a different type of car with a similar shape: white Hyundai Elantras from the model years 2011 to 2013.
Just across the state border, at Washington State University, campus police officers began looking through their records for Elantras registered there. Among those they found was one registered to Mr. Kohberger, who had moved to the area earlier in 2022 to pursue a Ph.D. in criminology.
They checked Mr. Kohberger's car more closely, according to a court affidavit, including visiting the parking lot near his apartment in the early morning hours of Nov. 29. But the vehicle was a 2015 model, not the earlier models being sought in Moscow.
The next day, records show, investigators in Moscow were also looking closely at another vehicle: Ms. Goncalves's car. She had purchased a 2015 Range Rover in the days before her death. Detectives gathered information on the registration, history and legal owners, clearly interested in the history of who had owned the car. But once again, the information provided few answers.
With students at the University of Idaho preparing for final exams, there was a permanent sense of apprehension in the air, as people began locking their doors, acquiring pepper spray and asking on social media how such a brazen killer could remain undetected for so long in a town that had not seen a murder in seven years.
The hunt broadened as investigators vacuumed up more records and data. They had already sought cellphone data for all phones that pinged cell towers within a half-mile of the victims' house from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., according to search warrant filings. They collected victims' bank records, email correspondence and social media account data.
On Dec. 5, detectives made a new request for surveillance video, seeking all footage recorded on U.P.S. delivery trucks in the days before and after the killings.
The next day, after getting back data on Ms. Goncalves's account on the Tinder dating app, detectives asked for details on 19 specific account-holders, including their locations, credit card information and any "private images, pictures or videos" associated with the accounts.
The request allowed the inquiry to go much broader than an ordinary search for information, using a single warrant to target 19 different people, said Orin Kerr, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
"You couldn't get one warrant to search 19 houses," he said.
Investigators were also working with a key piece of evidence: a Ka-Bar knife sheath, branded with a U.S. Marine Corps logo, that had been found next to two of the victims. They initially began looking for local stores that may have sold the weapon, and then fanned out.
A request to Amazon sought the order histories of account holders who had purchased such knives. A follow-up request to eBay focused on a series of specific users, seeking their purchase histories. Some had connections to the area -- including one in Idaho and two in Washington State -- while others were from far away, including an account in Japan. Because of redactions, it is unclear if Mr. Kohberger's name came up in those records.
The overall data track was growing enormous, demonstrating the extensive breadth of data on consumer platforms that can be made accessible to law enforcement agencies when they are at the stage of hunting for bread crumbs.
"You could say this is uncharted territory," Mr. Kerr said. "They are novel legal questions when there are so many records out there."
At the same time, DNA from the scene was being processed. Forensic teams had examined the knife sheath and found DNA that did not belong to any of the inhabitants of the house. They ran the sample through the F.B.I.'s database, which contains millions of DNA profiles of past criminal offenders, but according to three people briefed on the case, they did not get a match.
At that point, investigators decided to try genetic genealogy, a method that until now has been used primarily to solve cold cases, not active murder investigations. Among the growing number of genealogy websites that help people trace their ancestors and relatives via their own DNA, some allow users to select an option that permits law enforcement to compare crime scene DNA samples against the websites' data.
A distant cousin who has opted into the system can help investigators building a family tree from crime scene DNA to triangulate and identify a potential perpetrator of a crime. In one of the best-known uses of genealogy in solving a cold case, detectives in 2018 were able to arrest a suspect in a string of rapes and murders years before in California that had been attributed to the so-called Golden State Killer.
Once a suspect is identified, a direct genetic comparison can be used as confirmation before making an arrest.
With few formal regulations, the use of mass genealogy databases has raised concerns about privacy and whether limits should be placed on how the method is used. But authorities across the country say they have found potential in the system to produce leads that are unattainable through traditional investigative efforts.
Barbara Rae-Venter, a genealogy consultant who worked on the Golden State Killer case, said there was now growing interest in using genealogical DNA not just in cold cases but also in active crime investigations.
"That is why the Idaho case is so interesting," she said.
To do the genealogical analysis, the Idaho State Police contracted with a private company, Othram, in Texas, which had a lab able to produce a more extensive DNA profile from the knife sheath than the state lab was set up to examine.
F.B.I. personnel worked with the profile that Othram had produced, according to two people familiar with the investigation, spending days building out a family tree that began with a distant relative.
By the morning of Dec. 19, records show, investigators had a name: Bryan Kohberger. He had a white Elantra. He was a student at a university eight miles from the murder scene.
Mr. Kohberger was already out of town, his semester complete. He had driven home with his father to Pennsylvania, stopped twice by the police along the way for what officers said was tailgating. Just as agents began to scour his background more thoroughly, he had been terminated from his position as a teaching assistant, after what was described as altercations with a professor.
On Dec. 23, investigators sought and received Mr. Kohberger's cellphone records. The results added more to their suspicions: His phone was moving around in the early morning hours of Nov. 13, but was disconnected from cell networks -- perhaps turned off -- in the two hours around when the killings occurred.
Four days later, agents in Pennsylvania managed to retrieve some trash from Mr. Kohberger's family residence, sending the material to the Idaho State Police forensic lab. Checking it against their original DNA profile, the lab was able to reach a game-changing conclusion: The DNA in the trash belonged to a close relative of whoever had left DNA on the knife sheath.
Mr. Kohberger was arrested on Dec. 30.
"We have an individual in custody who committed these horrible crimes, and I do believe our community is safe," the police chief, Mr. Fry, announced. "But we still do need to be vigilant, right?"

MOSCOW, Idaho — In the weeks after four University of Idaho students were found slaughtered in a house near campus last November, a growing roster of investigators desperately searching for answers had yet to identify a suspect or even find the murder weapon.
Publicly, authorities were assuring worried residents in the small college town that they were making progress. Privately, they were exhausting their prospects, scouring through the backgrounds of those with the thinnest possible connections to the case.
Through the first two weeks of December, investigators put some of their focus on classmates of the victims; they also widened the search to examine a man in another state who had been known to send harassing messages to women but had visited Idaho only twice in his life. They looked at a woman previously charged with assaults in the region. They looked at a man once accused of wielding a knife. They looked at sex offenders. They looked at a white supremacist. Each turned out to be a dead end.
Then, after spending weeks sifting through an array of evidence that seemed to lead nowhere, investigators announced an arrest in late December on the other side of the country: Bryan Kohberger, a doctorate student from a nearby university. He was identified only after investigators turned to an advanced method of DNA analysis that had rarely been used in active murder investigations.
The story of how dozens of officers from local, state and federal agencies took the quadruple murder investigation into extraordinary territory is only now becoming more apparent, through recently obtained records and interviews with people familiar with the investigation who discussed key details that emerged before the issuance of a gag order in the case.
The case has shown the degree to which law enforcement investigators have come to rely on the digital footprints that ordinary Americans leave in nearly every facet of their lives. Online shopping, car sales, carrying a cellphone, drives along city streets and amateur genealogy all played roles in an investigation that was solved, in the end, as much through technology as traditional sleuthing.
Now indicted on four counts of murder, Kohberger has declined to enter a plea but contended previously through his lawyer that he would be exonerated. Investigators have yet to detail a possible motive: To this day, family members of the victims remain unaware of any prior connections that Kohberger had with the four young people who were killed.
The process of identifying and arresting a suspect took more than six weeks — weeks of increasing frustration and painstaking examination of evidence as the community pushed for answers.
The first 911 call came in around noon, some seven hours after the killings. Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20, had been stabbed to death overnight in their bedrooms. Initially, the Moscow Police Department described the attack as “targeted” and assured residents that there was no risk to the public. But with no indication of who had committed the attack or why, authorities eventually backtracked.
“We cannot say that there is no threat to the community,” police Chief James Fry said at a news conference Nov. 16, three days after the killings.
The department, which had only a few dozen officers, enlisted the Idaho State Police and the FBI to help, bringing in dozens of additional investigators. Forensic teams processed evidence from the bedrooms, snapped photos around the home’s back door and hunted for footprints; others searched for surveillance video from around town.
A week after the killings, records show, investigators were on the lookout for a certain type of vehicle: Nissan Sentras from the model years 2019 to 2023. Quietly, they ran down details on thousands of such vehicles, including the owners’ addresses, license plate numbers and the color of each sedan.
But further scrutiny of the video footage produced more clarity, and on Nov. 25 police in Moscow asked law enforcement agencies to look for a different type of car with a similar shape: white Hyundai Elantras from the model years 2011 to 2013.
Just across the state border, at Washington State University, campus police officers began looking through their records for Elantras registered there. Among those they found was one registered to Kohberger, who had moved to the area earlier in 2022 to pursue a doctorate in criminology.
They checked Kohberger’s car more closely, according to a court affidavit, including visiting the parking lot near his apartment in the early morning hours of Nov. 29. But the vehicle was a 2015 model, not the earlier models being sought in Moscow.
The next day, records show, investigators in Moscow were also looking closely at another vehicle: Goncalves’ car. She had purchased a 2015 Range Rover in the days before her death. Detectives gathered information on the registration, history and legal owners, clearly interested in the history of who had owned the car. But once again, the information provided few answers.
With students at the University of Idaho preparing for final exams, there was a permanent sense of apprehension in the air, as people began locking their doors, acquiring pepper spray and asking on social media how such a brazen killer could remain undetected for so long in a town that had not seen a murder in seven years.
The hunt broadened as investigators vacuumed up more records and data. They had already sought cellphone data for all phones that pinged cell towers within a half-mile of the victims’ house from 3 to 5 a.m., according to search warrant filings. They collected victims’ bank records, email correspondence and social media account data.
On Dec. 5, detectives made a new request for surveillance video, seeking all footage recorded on UPS delivery trucks in the days before and after the killings.
The next day, after getting back data on Goncalves’ account on the Tinder dating app, detectives asked for details on 19 specific account holders, including their locations, credit card information and any “private images, pictures or videos” associated with the accounts.
The request allowed the inquiry to go much broader than an ordinary search for information, using a single warrant to target 19 people, said Orin Kerr, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
“You couldn’t get one warrant to search 19 houses,” he said.
Investigators were also working with a key piece of evidence: a Ka-Bar knife sheath, branded with a U.S. Marine Corps logo, that had been found next to two of the victims. They initially began looking for local stores that may have sold the weapon, and then fanned out.
A request to Amazon sought the order histories of account holders who had purchased such knives. A follow-up request to eBay focused on a series of specific users, seeking their purchase histories. Some had connections to the area — including one in Idaho and two in Washington state — while others were from far away, including an account in Japan. Because of redactions, it is unclear if Kohberger’s name came up in those records.
The overall data track was growing enormous, demonstrating the extensive breadth of data on consumer platforms that can be made accessible to law enforcement agencies when they are at the stage of hunting for breadcrumbs.
“You could say this is uncharted territory,” Kerr said. “They are novel legal questions when there are so many records out there.”
At the same time, DNA from the scene was being processed. Forensic teams had examined the knife sheath and found DNA that did not belong to any of the inhabitants of the house. They ran the sample through the FBI’s database, which contains millions of DNA profiles of past criminal offenders, but according to three people briefed on the case, they did not get a match.
At that point, investigators decided to try genetic genealogy, a method that until now has been used primarily to solve cold cases, not active murder investigations. Among the growing number of genealogy websites that help people trace their ancestors and relatives via their own DNA, some allow users to select an option that permits law enforcement to compare crime scene DNA samples against the websites’ data.
A distant cousin who has opted into the system can help investigators building a family tree from crime scene DNA to triangulate and identify a potential perpetrator of a crime. In one of the best-known uses of genealogy in solving a cold case, detectives in 2018 were able to arrest a suspect in a string of rapes and murders years before in California that had been attributed to the so-called Golden State Killer.
Once a suspect is identified, a direct genetic comparison can be used as confirmation before making an arrest.
With few formal regulations, the use of mass genealogy databases has raised concerns about privacy and whether limits should be placed on how the method is used. But authorities across the country say they have found potential in the system to produce leads that are unattainable through traditional investigative efforts.
Barbara Rae-Venter, a genealogy consultant who worked on the Golden State Killer case, said there was now growing interest in using genealogical DNA not just in cold cases but also in active crime investigations.
“That is why the Idaho case is so interesting,” she said.
To do the genealogical analysis, the Idaho State Police contracted with a private company, Othram, in Texas, which had a lab able to produce a more extensive DNA profile from the knife sheath than the state lab was set up to examine.
FBI personnel worked with the profile that Othram had produced, according to two people familiar with the investigation, spending days building out a family tree that began with a distant relative.
By the morning of Dec. 19, records show, investigators had a name: Bryan Kohberger. He had a white Elantra. He was a student at a university 8 miles from the scene of the killings.
Kohberger was already out of town, his semester complete. He had driven home with his father to Pennsylvania, stopped twice by police along the way for what officers said was tailgating. Just as agents began to scour his background more thoroughly, he had been terminated from his position as a teaching assistant, after what was described as altercations with a professor.
On Dec. 23, investigators sought and received Kohberger’s cellphone records. The results added more to their suspicions: His phone was moving around in the early morning hours of Nov. 13, but was disconnected from cell networks — perhaps turned off — in the two hours around when the killings occurred.
Four days later, agents in Pennsylvania managed to retrieve some trash from Kohberger’s family residence, sending the material to the Idaho State Police forensic lab. Checking it against the original DNA profile, the lab was able to reach a game-changing conclusion: The DNA in the trash belonged to a close relative of whomever had left DNA on the knife sheath.
Kohberger was arrested Dec. 30.
“We have an individual in custody who committed these horrible crimes, and I do believe our community is safe,” the police chief, Fry, announced. “But we still do need to be vigilant, right?”

Stellantis Warns That British Carmakers Will Struggle to Compete as the World Embraces E.V.s: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stellantis said post-Brexit export rules and the lack of a domestic battery manufacturer could force it to close its plants in Britain.
A distress flare has gone up from the beleaguered British car manufacturing industry. Stellantis, the company behind brands like Peugeot, Fiat and Vauxhall vehicles, has warned a Parliamentary committee that automakers with plants in Britain will struggle to compete in coming years amid the switch to electric vehicles and new post-Brexit export requirements.
The company implied that it might shut down its two plants in Britain, where it employs more than 5,000 people.
"If the cost of E.V. manufacturing becomes uncompetitive and unsustainable, operations will close," the company warned in a five-page document published this week.
These words resonated across the country on Wednesday, partly because Stellantis plans to play an important role in the electrification of the British auto industry. The company is retooling it plants at Ellesmere Port, near Liverpool, to produce small electric vans. Stellantis is already the largest producer in Britain of the popular Vauxhall commercial vans. The vans, used for e-commerce deliveries, are manufactured at a factory in Luton, north of London.
The comments added to worries that car making was in a deep downward spiral in a nation that once produced iconic vehicles like the Jaguar XK-E and the Morris Minor.
The number of cars produced in Britain has fallen sharply, to 775,000 last year from a peak of more than 1.7 million in 2016, the year voters approved a referendum to leave the European Union. Production did, however, increase by 6 percent in the first quarter of 2023 from a year earlier, as parts problems eased.
Yet vehicle manufacturing remains an important industry in Britain, employing 182,000 people and making up 10 percent of Britain's goods exports, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, an industry group.
Britain's exit from the European Union has created doubts for carmakers considering investing in the country. Eight out of 10 cars made in Britain are exported, with more than half shipped to E.U. countries, and British exporters must now navigate trade rules to sell to the bloc.
The shift to electric vehicles may be even more threatening, analysts say, because it is forcing global carmakers to make major decisions about where to place their bets for the future.
"The real transition is the transition to electric vehicles," said Peter Wells, an auto specialist at Cardiff Business School.
So far, Britain has not succeeded in attracting the multibillion-dollar investments it needs for building giant factories to make the batteries that account for much of the cost of electric vehicles.
The bankruptcy of a battery start-up called Britishvolt in January accentuated that shortcoming and, so far, no replacement appears to have been found.
"If that stays as the status quo I would contend that in 10 years the U.K. would largely lose its vehicle manufacturing capability," said Andy Palmer, a former chief operating officer of Nissan.
Mr. Palmer said that post-Brexit Britain finds itself caught between the United States, which through the Inflation Reduction Act is offering large tax incentives to encourage battery manufacturers, and the European Union, which will pull out all the stops to compete with the United States.
"That puts us in competition with the both the E.U. and the U.S." Mr. Palmer said.
The British government says that it realizes the importance of the car industry and is working on assuring its future.
"We are very focused on making sure" Britain has electric vehicle manufacturing, Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor of the Exchequer, told a business audience in London on Wednesday.
What specifically worries Stellantis and other makers is an import regulation that falls under the so-called Rules of Origin and is set to take effect next year. Under the rule, at least 45 percent of the value of the materials of cars exported to Europe must come from either Britain or the European Union if the makers want to avoid paying duties of 10 percent -- a stiff penalty in the highly competitive car business.
Stellantis says that it cannot meet these standards because of rising costs for raw materials among other issues. It says it wants the British government to negotiate a postponement of the rules until 2027.
The concerns are not limited to Britain. Stellantis forecast that there will not be enough battery supplies in Britain or Europe to meet the ambitious targets of governments for shifting to electric vehicles over the next few years.
Mr. Wells said the situation put a damper on the auto industry across Europe. "How," he asked, "can Europe continue to supply into a booming electric vehicle market while simultaneously insisting on these local content rules?"

Sendoff for Police Officer Shot 33 Years Ago: [National Desk]

Full text: Detective Troy Patterson, mortally wounded during a robbery in Brooklyn, remained in a coma for more than three decades before dying last week.
Detective Troy Patterson's body was slid into a waiting hearse on Friday, 33 years after he last patrolled the New York City streets.
He was a 27-year-old officer then, and a prolific one. In his six and a half years on the New York Police Department force, he was responsible for over 150 arrests, according to Edward A. Caban, the department's first deputy commissioner, who spoke at the funeral ceremony.
He specialized in gun crime at a time when New York was at its nadir: In 1990, there were 2,245 homicides, the highest recorded number in the city's history. And on Jan. 16 of that year, Detective Patterson nearly became among the first victims.
As he washed his Nissan Maxima near his home in Brooklyn, he was confronted by a small group of men. They tried to rob the officer, who was off-duty; the teenager accused of being the gunman, Tracy Clark, then 15, was seeking $ 20 to join a local basketball league, the police said at the time.
Detective Patterson was shot in the head, critically wounded. Doctors removed the bullet from his skull, but he remained in a semivegetative state for over three decades, cared for at first by his mother, Katherine Patterson, for 17 years until she died from complications from multiple sclerosis, according to reports. He was promoted to detective in 2016, and was most recently cared for by his aunt, the family said.
Detective Patterson died on April 29, never emerging from his coma. Yet he laughed on occasion, and seemed to know when his family was with him, his son, Troy Patterson Jr., has said.
Mr. Patterson was 5 years old when his father was shot. Speakers recalled the detective's love for his Nissan, which he took meticulous care of, and how only his young son was allowed to violate the many rules he applied to this beloved car. He let Troy Jr. stand on the armrest and pop his head out the sunroof on father-son joy rides.
On Friday, Mr. Patterson, now nearly 40, recalled seeing his father in the intensive care unit at Kings County Hospital as a child. "I used to wonder, why can't he walk? Why can't he talk?" he said at the funeral. "I love you, Dad."
Hundreds of police officers, many wearing their dress uniforms and white gloves, lined Park Place outside First Church of God in Christ in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn on Friday morning. They included members of the 60th Precinct, where Detective Patterson had been stationed, police motorcycles, a police band and even police dogs.
Mayor Eric L. Adams, a former police officer, recalled the visits he made with fellow officers to Detective Patterson's bedside, and to a memorial where he was shot. He reminded mourners of the environment that eventually claimed the detective's life: streets that he said were filled with violence, crack cocaine and "people waking up to gunshots and not alarm clocks."
"But men like Troy stayed," the mayor continued. "They didn't flee."
Some civilians also attended the funeral, listening to the eulogies over loudspeakers on the street. Tricia Clairmont, 54, an educator, had heard about the ceremony on the news that morning. She stood outside the church on Friday dressed in funeral attire, at times with damp eyes.
Ms. Clairmont applauded the herculean efforts to keep Detective Patterson alive, even without hope of his recovery. "He was still breathing through it all," she said. "That's a miracle. That's still a miracle."
Retina DeFreitas, 69, a retired health care worker, had stumbled upon the funeral when she stepped outside her home. She stayed for the entire ceremony. She was sad for the family's loss, but happy, in a way, for the detective, she said. "I think he is with the Lord -- he suffered enough."
He died at Hartwyck at Oak Tree, a rehabilitation center in Edison, N.J. The exact cause of death is still being determined.
Mr. Adams remembered how difficult the visits to New Jersey were, and how he and others tried to "put on a good face."
"When we left the room, we left that meeting, for 33 years, all of us would sit in our cars privately and just uncontrollably cry while we watched such an energetic, joyful, good man live his life in that manner," he said.
Mr. Clark, the accused gunman, was acquitted of attempted murder, but convicted of assault and attempted robbery. Two accomplices, Vincent Robbins, then 20, and Darren Crawford, 17, were convicted on similar charges.
Some in law enforcement, including Paul DiGiacomo, the president of New York City's Detectives' Endowment Association, have called for upgraded charges following the death. A spokesman for the Brooklyn district attorney said the case was being reviewed.
As Detective Patterson's coffin was removed from the church on the shoulders of six police officers, the mayor put his hand on his heart. Three police helicopters flew over in a tight triangle formation. They dipped so low they appeared to almost skim the Crown Heights brownstones.

Ford Motor Made $1.8 Billion As Shortage of Parts Eased: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sales increased from a year earlier, when the automaker was hampered by parts shortages.
Ford Motor reported a solid profit in the first quarter, although the automaker indicated that its turnaround was not complete and that it had a ways to go before it starts making money on electric vehicles.
On Tuesday, the company said it made $ 1.8 billion in profit in the first three months of 2023 as a result of a substantial increase in revenue and in the number of vehicles it sold around the world, the company said Tuesday.
The positive result is a recovery from the same period a year ago, when the automaker lost $ 3.1 billion as the value of its stake in the electric-vehicle maker Rivian declined.
In 2022, Ford was slowed by shortages of computer chips and other key parts that prevented it from making as many vehicles as it had expected.
"When you look at the core and the quarter, it's solid," the company's chief executive, Jim Farley, said in a conference call with analysts. "We saw growth across all our key metrics. Our balance sheet is strong."
For the first quarter, the company reported revenue of $ 41.5 billion, up 20 percent from $ 34.5 billion in the year-earlier period. Globally, Ford sold 1.1 million cars and trucks in the first quarter, compared with 966,000 in the first three months of 2022.
Ford, which is trying to streamline its operations and cut costs, reiterated a forecast of $ 9 billion to $ 11 billion in profit for the full year before interest and taxes.
For the first time, Ford reported separate results for its electric vehicle division. The E.V. business lost $ 700 million before interest and taxes in the first quarter, while a unit making traditional gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles doubled its profit to $ 2.6 billion.
The E.V. business is not yet producing vehicles in sufficient volumes to generate profits. It was especially slowed in the first quarter, when the company halted production of the F-150 Lightning pickup to fix a battery defect and stopped making the Mustang Mach-E, a sport-utility vehicle, to modify its plant to roughly double output.
The production disruptions caused Ford's sales of the Mach-E to fall about 20 percent, to just under 5,400 vehicles. Sales of the F-150 Lightning totaled almost 4,300 trucks. That was higher than a low figure from a year ago, when the truck was just going into production, but fewer than Ford had been hoping for.
Separately on Tuesday, Ford said it was lowering prices of most versions of the Mach-E by $ 3,000 to $ 4,000. The vehicle, introduced two years ago, now competes with similar electric S.U.V.s from Hyundai, Volkswagen, Nissan, Tesla and other manufacturers.
"It's a competitive segment," Mr. Farley said.
Mr. Farley said that over the course of this year, Ford would narrow its losses on those two vehicles and the E-Transit, a delivery van. He also predicted that those three models would be profitable before interest and taxes by the end of 2024.
A third line of business, Ford Pro, which produces commercial trucks and services for fleet operators, nearly tripled its earnings before interest and taxes to $ 1.4 billion.
In the past, Ford broke out its operations geographically. The new form of reporting is intended to show how fast the company's E.V. business is growing, in hopes of attracting investors.
Ford plans to give investors a closer look at its strategy and operations in a two-day conference this month.
The earnings announcement came after the markets closed. Ford shares were down about 2 percent in extended trading.

Full text: 'Decarb bros' think the best way to combat climate change is to ditch the gloom of earlier environmentalism and focus on what new technology can do.
Decarb bros believe it's all going to be OK.
They believe that I.P.A.s go best with party chat about smart-grid management and electric vehicle infrastructure. They believe in trading memes on Twitter and in messaging groups, formed around their zeal for technology as the answer to a lower-emissions future.
And the bros, a loose affiliation of mostly young researchers, climate tech workers, policymakers and people following along online, believe in making fun of themselves, at least a little. See: "Decarb bros," a term they have embraced regardless of gender identity or weight-lifting ability.
What they do not believe in is wallowing.
"We are against doomerism," said Billy Casagrande, who works at Scale Microgrids, a climate tech start-up. He was referring to a pessimistic view that humanity has passed the point of being able to do anything about climate change.
The consensus among young people seems to be "that we are screwed as it relates to climate," the self-described decarb bro, who is 25, continued. Mr. Casagrande, one of dozens at a monthly meet-up in Brooklyn's Williamsburg neighborhood for clean energy enthusiasts, believes there is another way.
"The solutions are here. We just need to deploy them."
"Deploy" has become a rallying cry for decarb bros. They argue that deploying climate technology solutions -- solar panels, wind turbines, heat pumps, electric cars, meat alternatives (the list goes on) -- will decarbonize the economy while generating eye-popping financial returns.
"The environmental movement has been traditionally seen as altruistic," said Kyri Baker, an assistant professor of engineering at the University of Colorado and a self-described decarb bro. "It was about giving away stuff and making sacrifices."
The decarb bro flips those associations on their heads, rejecting pure doom and putting faith in business innovation and government spending to fight climate change.
The bro label has historically been associated with negative connotations of toxic masculinity and exclusivity, Dr. Baker said. But she thinks the term is undergoing a shift and taking on a gender-inclusive status. The decarb bro is "someone who's working toward something that we all care about" without adopting the sacrificial tone of traditional environmentalism, she said.
Dr. Baker sees aspects of the decarb bro culture as an antidote to the wonkiness and self-seriousness of parts of the environmental movement. In particular, she cited the Twitter account Bros for Decarbonization, which shares memes that connect bro-approved activities -- namely drinking, lifting weights and making money -- with decarbonizing the economy.
A competitive powerlifter, Dr. Baker loved the account's frequent gym references. "It's a bro-ey thing to put away your weights; it's a bro-ey thing to put away your carbon emissions," she said.
Like Dr. Baker, James McGinniss, the founder of David Energy, a climate tech start-up with over $ 20 million in funding, felt "environmentalism was just not functioning as a narrative."
For decades, saving the planet was seen as requiring sacrifice. Environmentalists were primarily concerned with "scarcity, reducing consumption and population growth," said Paul Sabin, an environmental historian at Yale.
Green technological development was also at a different stage, said Bill McKibben, the environmentalist and author. Solar panels were not yet commercially viable; the mainstreaming of electric vehicles was still decades away.
"In the olden times, we viewed clean energy as 'alternative energy' -- the Whole Foods of energy," Mr. McKibben said. Now that "pointing a sheet of glass at the sun is the cheapest way to make power on planet Earth," he continued, green-powered products can be "the Safeway."
The change in technology has also shifted, for many, what it means to work on climate. Through the first decade of this century, working on limiting emissions usually meant working for a government or an NGO. Today, it can be working for a start-up, consultancy or financial institution.
"Business has caught up," Mr. Sabin said.
Still, Mr. Sabin cautioned against a total reliance on technology to fight climate change. "An abundance strategy is very optimistic that we are going to be able to have it all through technological innovation," he said. "But we haven't actually produced that solution yet."
The decarb bro is undaunted.
The way Mr. Casagrande sees it, the only way to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 is through abundance -- that is, building things that reduce emissions and that people want to buy.
Using a business mind-set to widely scale decarbonized technology means tantalizing consumers with products that are appealing not just because of their lower carbon footprint. They must be faster (think high-torque electric vehicles), cheaper (think near-free electricity from solar panels) or cooler (that one's a bit subjective).
The decarb bro philosophy -- "the carrot, instead of the stick" -- has at least one fan in Washington. Jigar Shah is the director of the Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office, which provides debt funding for energy projects. He frequently engages with the Bros for Decarbonization Twitter account, replying to its tweets and emphasizing its pro-tech, pro-growth philosophy.
"The modern environmental movement is to accelerate climate solutions through technology," Mr. Shah said in an interview. "Bros for Decarb shows that persistence," and "being focused on the positive" matters in advancing that goal.
Even talking about cars and other (guilt-free) goods to buy is a real change in what environmentalism looks like, Dr. Baker said. Practicing environmentalism used to entail downsizing your car or buying less stuff. That's no longer the case.
"The Nissan Leaf -- that is not a cool car," she said. "But you get in a Tesla -- now that thing is indescribable."
And decarb bros might find people are hiring.
Last year, more than $ 64 billion in new funding for firms that invest in climate start-ups was announced, according to the newsletter Climate Tech VC. Excitement about climate tech has persisted despite fears of a recession.
The techno-optimist, anti-doom-and-gloom ethos of the decarb bro runs through the climate tech ecosystem, said Mr. McGinniss, the start-up founder. According to him, climate tech embraces optimism: "There are amazing solutions out there."
Climate tech is "bright, it's shiny, it's new, it screams opportunity," said Naya Shim, an associate at a climate tech fellowship program. "It's a gold mine."
According to Ms. Shim, there is also a social urgency to highlighting the economic benefits of the climate movement. While she does not consider herself a decarb bro, she has noticed the impact of the decarb bro philosophy, and its message of economic opportunity, on her peers.
People used to want to work in crypto or take high-salaried jobs at software companies selling ads. Now Ms. Shim is heartened to see more of her friends -- even her "finance bro" friends -- wanting to work in climate.
"The next big thing is the planet," she said. "Without it, there will be no NFTs."
Aligning profit incentives with doing good for the world is part of what separates the decarb bro from other bros, said Sara Hastings-Simon, a scientist, decarb bro enthusiast and craft beer lover. The decarb bro is "an enlightened bro for climate," she said.
Isaias Hernandez, an environmental educator and the founder of the Instagram account queerbrownvegan, isn't so sure. "We can't frame the ecological crisis as a way to profit," he said. That incentive structure, he fears, opens up the gates to greenwashing and inequality.
"When you talk to climate tech bros, they're very obsessed with one solution as the end-all be-all," he said.
Instead, Mr. Hernandez wants his audience to think about approaching climate change through grass-roots organizing. "When we rely on large technocratic solutions to save our communities, they often don't really involve the communities," he said.
Mr. Hernandez is not alone in critically examining the role of business in fighting climate change. The degrowth movement, a segment of the environmentalism movement, holds that economic growth is no longer benefiting humanity and that fighting climate change requires untethering from a focus on gross domestic product.
Still, in the eyes of the decarb bro, money is a powerful motivator for solving the planetary crisis. "There are significant economic opportunities," Mr. Casagrande said. "I don't think people should feel guilty about that."

Car Show Flaunts China's Switch to Electric: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Shanghai auto show, the largest in China since before the pandemic, had one theme: The dominance of electric vehicles in the world's largest car market is here to stay.
A hall showing off electric vehicles made by Nio, XPeng Motors, Zeekr and dozens of other Chinese companies was mobbed with visitors. An area nearby full of gasoline-powered cars by foreign brands barely got a second look by anyone.
At the same event, Volkswagen, which vies with Toyota to be the world's biggest seller of cars with combustion engines, issued a bold forecast: Within two years, half the cars sold in China, the world's largest automobile market, will be electric, up from only 6 percent in 2020.
The theme at the Shanghai auto show this week was clear. Electric cars are here to stay, and Chinese automakers are leading the field.
Silvio Pietro Angori, the chief executive and managing director of Pininfarina of Italy, a nearly century-old car design business, said the global industry was not going back.
The internal combustion engine, he said, "is done, it's gone, it doesn't exist any more."
The Shanghai auto show is one of the world's biggest, and the first of its size in China since 2019. During the pandemic, when China's borders were sealed because of "zero Covid" precautions, its auto industry was quietly transformed and the market share of foreign companies shrank. Today half the cars sold in Shanghai itself are already electric.
Brian Gu, the president and vice chairman of Xpeng, said his company planned to reduce the cost of building a powertrain -- primarily the battery and electric motor -- by 25 percent by the end of the year. Powertrains, particularly the batteries, make up about two-fifths of Xpeng's overall cost of building an electric car.
Ashwani Gupta, the chief operating officer of Nissan, one-upped Xpeng, saying his company's latest designs would cut powertrain costs by 30 percent. Shohei Yamazaki, the chairman of Nissan's China investments subsidiary, said Nissan would rely heavily on Chinese suppliers.
"Price competition in China is very fierce right now," he said.
Chinese brands have adopted unusual electric car designs while foreign companies and their Chinese joint ventures have played it safe. The wheels are nearly at the corners of the Chinese brand cars, an architecture that also allows more room for batteries under the floor in the middle. Nio and Xpeng have chosen sleek designs, while Changan, based in western China, is making cars so rectangular that they look faintly Cubist.
"Some of that comes from the freedom from legacy," said Felix Kilbertus, the chief creative officer at Pininfarina.
Great Wall, a Chinese maker of sport utility vehicles, has a new electric car brand, Ora, that is targeted to women. It named car models for cats, partly to appeal to lovers of the Hello Kitty brand. It has an electric car that strongly resembles a Volkswagen Beetle.
The main market for electric cars so far is China -- E.V.s were a quarter of China's market last year, compared with less than 6 percent in the United States.
Most of the cars displayed at the auto show use lithium batteries, the current industry standard, though companies are developing vehicles that run fully or partly on batteries made of sodium.
At the moment, there is a glut of lithium batteries, but long term many in the industry believe sodium can become a viable alternative or supplement to lithium as a key ingredient in E.V. batteries. For one thing, the production of sodium batteries would be better for the climate.
Toyota's chief scientist, Gill Pratt, contended at a session of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January that overall greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced more by replacing 90 gasoline cars with hybrid cars than by using the same amount of scarce lithium to build one battery-electric car.
"If you think about the total amount of lithium that the world has, the key is let's use it where it does the most good," he said.
Toyota has a vested interest in questioning the availability of lithium. It owns many key patents for hybrid cars, and has emphasized them over entirely electric cars that require far more lithium. American and European automakers like Ford Motor and Volkswagen, as well as most Chinese automakers, are still betting on battery-electric cars.
Prototype cars with all-sodium batteries that were disclosed in recent weeks by Chinese domestic carmakers and battery manufacturers have been low-budget microcars. One of them, the Sihao Huaxianzi from JAC Motors, in collaboration with HiNA, a sodium battery start-up, is designed for a top speed of 75 miles an hour.
Pulkit Khurana, a co-founder of Battery Smart, an Indian company that provides batteries for three-wheeled auto rickshaws, expressed doubt that any technology, including sodium, would displace conventional lithium batteries soon. And with the price of lithium having dropped by two-thirds since November, the cost of lithium batteries is likely to drop significantly, he said.
A midsize car or sport utility vehicle would have enough room for a far larger sodium battery than the low-cost subcompacts that Chinese manufacturers are initially building. Another possibility is to use a combination of sodium and lithium cells in a single car battery.
Using an artificial intelligence computer program, China's CATL, the world's largest manufacturer of electric car batteries, has figured out the complex electronics and programming for battery packs with some lithium cells and some sodium cells, said Huang Qisen, the deputy dean of company's research institute.
CATL -- the company's full name is Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. -- said at the auto show that it would make sodium battery cars in cooperation with Chery, a Chinese automaker that is strongest in manufacturing low-cost subcompacts. But both companies declined to provide any details.
Switching to sodium could solve one of the biggest problems with lithium batteries, which put out much less electricity in freezing temperatures.
Because of chemical differences between sodium and lithium, a sodium battery loses less than a tenth of its power at very cold temperatures, according to battery chemistry experts.
"It is promising," said Ouyang Chuying, the president of research and development at CATL. "Sodium has no resource limit."

U.S. Brands Gain Edge With Tax Breaks for E.V.s: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Rules that take effect on Tuesday will limit the $ 7,500 credits to electric cars made domestically with minerals from the U.S. or trade allies.
American brands like Tesla and General Motors will benefit most from rules that determine which electric vehicles qualify for tax credits starting on Tuesday. Foreign carmakers like Hyundai will be at a significant disadvantage because of restrictions aimed at cutting China out of the supply chain.
Only 10 vehicles will initially qualify for tax credits of $ 7,500, less than a quarter of the battery-powered cars on sale in the United States. But those 10 include many of the most popular models and accounted for two-thirds of electric vehicle sales before the new rules took effect.
Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y, the best-selling electric vehicles in the United States, will qualify for the full $ 7,500 credit, with one exception, according to a list published by the Treasury Department on Monday. The least expensive version of the Model 3 will qualify for only half the credit because its battery is made in China.
G.M.'s Chevrolet Bolt, one of the cheapest electric vehicles on the market, will also qualify, as will sport utility vehicles and pickups that the company plans to begin selling this year.
Fewer Ford vehicles will qualify for the full $ 7,500 credit because of rules requiring that a certain percentage of the battery components and minerals like lithium come from either domestic sources or trade allies. Ford's Mustang Mach-E, the third-best-selling electric vehicle in the United States last year, according to Kelley Blue Book, will be eligible for only half the credit because its Polish-made battery does not meet domestic sourcing requirements. The F-150 Lightning pickup will continue to qualify for the full credit.
Chrysler and Jeep, divisions of Stellantis, do not yet sell cars that run solely on batteries, but several of their hybrid models will qualify for at least some of the credit. Hybrid vehicles can qualify if their batteries have a capacity of at least seven kilowatt-hours.
The rules give U.S. carmakers at least a temporary advantage over competitors like Toyota, Volkswagen and Nissan. No foreign automakers were on the Treasury list, which is expected to grow as companies adjust their supply chains.
Carmakers that qualify for the tax credits will now have a head start as sales of electric vehicles take off. "It causes a multiplier effect in the market," Paul Jacobson, G.M.'s chief financial officer, told reporters in New York this month. The rules, he added, are "very consistent with the strategy that we had already adopted."
The rules grow out of the Inflation Reduction Act, which Democrats passed last year to fight climate change and encourage domestic manufacturing among other things. The Treasury Department was responsible for writing regulations based on the legislation.
The law seeks to reduce the auto industry's reliance on China, which makes most of the world's batteries and dominates the processing of raw materials. The law also establishes limits on sales prices and excludes individuals who earn more than $ 150,000 a year and couples who make more than $ 300,000. The rules also exclude vehicles made outside North America, including in allied countries like South Korea and Germany.
"We were not happy," José Muñoz, the chief executive of Hyundai and Genesis Motor North America, said in an interview at the New York International Auto Show this month. Hyundai's Ioniq 6 electric sedan was named World Car of the Year at the show, but will not be eligible for tax credits because it is assembled in South Korea.
Hyundai, based in Seoul, is investing $ 10 billion to build car and battery plants in Georgia, which will allow the company to meet the Inflation Reduction Act requirements -- but not for several years.
Officials at the carmaker and the South Korean government asked the Biden administration to allow Hyundai and Kia cars to qualify for credits while the factories were under construction, but were told that the law did not allow such an exception, Mr. Muñoz said.
The Hyundai car factory in Georgia is expected to begin producing cars in 2025. The battery plant, which Hyundai is building with SK On, will start production in 2026. "We are working on putting ahead that date so we can qualify earlier," Mr. Muñoz said.
Tesla had already told potential buyers that the least expensive version of the Model 3 sedan would qualify for only half the credit, or $ 3,750. This month, Tesla cut the price of that car by $ 1,000 to $ 41,990. After the partial credit is accounted for, the car will effectively cost many buyers a little more than $ 38,000, about as much as a top-of-the-line Honda Accord and cheaper than an entry-level BMW 3 Series sedan.
Other versions of the Model 3 and Model Y S.U.V. will continue to receive the full credit. Tesla sold more electric vehicles in the United States last year than all other carmakers combined, according to Kelley Blue Book.
Some auto executives have said the rules are too restrictive and undermine efforts to limit climate change. Other critics, like Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, have complained that the Biden administration's rules are too lenient.
Administration officials have argued that the regulations strike a balance between promoting electric vehicles and building a domestic supply chain.
By the administration's count, besides the 10 vehicles that qualify for the full credit, seven qualify for half the credit. Vehicles can qualify for half the credit if, for example, their battery components come from the United States, Canada or Mexico but the minerals used to make the batteries do not meet the sourcing requirements.
Ten vehicles that previously qualified, including the Nissan Leaf and the Volkswagen ID.4, will drop off the list, at least temporarily.
The ID.4, an S.U.V. made in Chattanooga, Tenn., did not make the new list because it is still assessing its supply chain. But Pablo Di Si, the chief executive of Volkswagen Group of America, said he expected the model to qualify. Volkswagen was fourth behind Tesla, G.M. and Ford in U.S. electric vehicle sales in the first three months of the year, according to Kelley Blue Book.
Five electric vehicles that G.M. sells or is planning to sell this year will qualify. In addition to the Bolt, the Cadillac Lyriq and electric versions of the Chevrolet Equinox and Blazer S.U.V.s and the Silverado pickup will qualify for the full credit. G.M. and LG Energy Solution have begun producing battery cells at a factory in Ohio.
The new rules could be revised in response to comments from the public. It is up to carmakers to show that they qualify, but they are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service and could be penalized if they provide incorrect information. The I.R.S. publishes a list of eligible vehicles that is updated regularly.
A provision in the law for commercial vehicles allows companies to collect the credits for all leased vehicles even if the cars don't meet sourcing and manufacturing requirements. Automakers and their dealers can pass on the savings to people who lease cars, and, as a result, Hyundai has seen a spike in leases, Mr. Muñoz said. The company is also offering cars through monthly subscriptions to let customers benefit from tax incentives and try electric cars.
But that will not make up for lost sales, because most people prefer buying rather than leasing or renting cars, Mr. Muñoz said.
"We cannot compete unless we simply drop dramatically the price," he said. "It's impossible to make it work from a financial point of view."

Challenges Could Stall Biden's E.V. Revolution: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The administration's push to supercharge E.V. sales must now surmount resistance from manufacturers and consumers as well as likely legal challenges.
WASHINGTON -- Aggressive rules proposed by the Biden administration to drastically speed up the country's transition to electric vehicles, and significantly cut the auto pollution that is dangerously heating the planet, face several economic, logistical and legal challenges.
The plans, outlined Wednesday by the Environmental Protection Agency, are designed to ensure that two-thirds of new passenger cars and a quarter of new heavy trucks sold in the United States are all-electric by 2032. If enacted as proposed, the regulations would mean a quantum leap for the auto industry in the United States, where just 5.8 percent of new cars and less than 2 percent of trucks sold last year were all-electric.
Transportation is the single largest source of greenhouse gases generated by the United States, the second-biggest polluting country after China. To head off climate catastrophe, President Biden has promised to cut the nation's emissions in half by 2030. Shrinking tailpipe emissions is key to that plan.
But to transform the American automobile industry on the scale it envisions, the Biden administration has to surmount resistance from manufacturers and consumers as well as likely legal challenges from those who consider the regulations government overreach.
One of the most important aspects of a wholesale transition to electric vehicles has to do with timing.
Although nearly every automaker has already invested billions in electrification, the proposed regulations create a dilemma: how to continue to manufacture gasoline-powered vehicles, which provide profits, while investing even more in new electric facilities. The aggressive timeline envisioned by the government means the carmakers could also struggle to source the materials required for vehicle batteries, already difficult to obtain.
Market demand is another challenge. Even with federal tax incentives of up to $ 7,500 for consumers, electric vehicles cost more upfront than conventional cars and trucks. At the end of 2022, the price of an average new car was $ 49,507 compared with $ 61,448 for an electric vehicle, according to the Kelley Blue Book. But even for motivated consumers who can afford electric vehicles, a major stumbling block is what's known as range anxiety, the fear of being stranded because an electric vehicle cannot reach its destination on a single charge and not enough fast-charging stations exit.
"This was always a transformation that was going to happen over decades," said Stephanie Brinley, an automotive analyst at S&P Global. "Putting this aggressive a timeline on it means that there are a lot of things that have to happen consecutively and concurrently."
Looming over all of this is an all-but-certain legal and political threat: The new rules could be erased by the courts or a future president.
In many ways, the industry is already moving into an all-electric future. General Motors has set a goal of phasing out the sale of all internal combustion vehicles by 2035. Ford Motor has said it hopes E.V.s make up half of its sales by 2030. Volkswagen and Stellantis, the company formed through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, have similar targets. Hyundai and Nissan are also ramping up E.V. production.
But the proposed regulations would require even more of automakers.
Ford is on track to spend $ 50 billion between 2022 through 2026 on its electric vehicle production, with two battery factories under construction in Kentucky, and a third planned in Tennessee, along with an electric truck plant. In February it announced it would build a $ 3.5 billion battery plant in Michigan with a Chinese partner.
The automaker, however, will most likely need to spend billions more if electric vehicles are to make up two-thirds of the more than two million vehicles that it sells in North America annually.
The risks of accelerating the transition away from gasoline-powered vehicles are "high, if not very high," for the industry, said Matthias Heck, a vice president at Moody's Investors Service, "because electrification will require further substantial investments into new battery electric vehicles, battery technology, supply chain and manufacturing capacity, and charging infrastructure."
Ford and other automakers also have not yet secured sufficient sources of lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese and other materials needed for automotive batteries, and it is unclear where they will get them.
While the Biden administration is betting that electric vehicle costs will come down with mass production, Carlos Tavares, chief executive of Stellantis, said the difficulty of sourcing materials worked against that. "The affordability is not there because the raw materials are scarce and very expensive, and, I would add, very volatile," Mr. Tavares said at a recent conference in Detroit.
Manufacturers are funding their electric vehicle production now from substantial profits on their gas-powered trucks and sport utility vehicles. But maintaining profitability as they produce more electric vehicles and fewer gas-powered models will be a challenge, experts say.
General Motors has said it is not yet making money on its electric vehicles, and Ford recently said its electric division was set to lose $ 3 billion this year. Both companies hope to turn the corner as they ramp up production of electric models but are also trying to cut costs now, especially in view of the uncertain economy.
G.M. is in the process of eliminating 5,000 jobs as part of an effort to reduce costs by $ 2 billion. Ford last year began to trim about 3,000 jobs from its work force.
"Getting to 50, 60 percent E.V.s is certainly possible," said Sam Abuelsamid, a principal research analyst at Guidehouse Insights. "But this isn't going to be easy. Not at all."
And while the pace of electric vehicle purchases is ticking up, many car buyers are uncertain about the new technology.
"We're making sales to early adopters and easy adopters but we need to get beyond them," said John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents large U.S. and foreign automakers. "We have a long way to go."
The most basic hurdle is price.
The federal government will offer buyers up to $ 7,500 in tax credits for the purchase of an electric vehicle for the next decade, depending on how much of the vehicle was made in the United States. But of the 91 unique electric vehicle models now on the market in the country, fewer than 40 qualify for the tax credits, Mr. Bozzella said.
Drivers are also worried about charging electric vehicles. There are currently 130,000 public electric vehicle charging stations in the United States, according to the White House. Under the 2021 infrastructure law, the government will spend $ 7.5 billion to build half a million electric vehicle charging stations along federal highways. But a January report from S&P Global concluded that the nation would need more than 2 million public charging stations by 2030, in addition to private home and garage chargers.
Doug Freeman, an insurance executive in Amesbury, Mass., is an obvious customer for an electric vehicle. He has a 140-mile round trip commute to work, and currently drives a Chevrolet Volt hybrid. "For me, the green side isn't number one on the priority list, but the savings on fuel from an electric vehicle would be a lot more than for the average consumer," he said.
But the model he covets, the Kia EV6, is not made in the United States and doesn't qualify for the $ 7,500 tax credit. "Without the credit, it's $ 50,000 to $ 54,000," Mr. Freeman said. "I've never paid more than about $ 33,000 for a car."
Electric vehicle makers are making use of one way to win over consumers: rentals. In 2021, Hertz, the car rental company, bought 100,000 Teslas, making E.V.s 20 percent of its fleet. Most other major car rental companies are also adding electric vehicles to their fleets.
"Rental cars are an excellent way to move E.V.s from niche to mainstream," said Drew Kodjak, executive director of the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research organization. "It offers consumers a way to test-drive electric vehicles for a few days, see if they like them, see how they feel about range anxiety," he said.
By purchasing American-made electric vehicles such as Teslas, the rental companies receive $ 7,500 in tax credits per car. And the Biden administration has made it easier for the rental companies to resell the cars after a few years: buyers can receive up to $ 4,000 in tax credits for the used electric cars.
"Through the incentives and the new laws, the administration has put in place a lot of policies to help automakers get where this regulation says they need to go," Ms. Brinley of S&P Global said.
Even if companies can churn out affordable electric vehicles at a fast pace, and consumers get over range anxiety, the proposed regulations are certain to be hit with legal challenges or be subject to shifting politics.
Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and gas industry, called the regulations "a major step toward a ban on the vehicles Americans rely on."
"As proposed, this rule will hurt consumers with higher costs and greater reliance on unstable foreign supply chains," Mr. Sommers said.
Former President Donald J. Trump relished rolling back the auto pollution regulations enacted by his predecessor, Barack Obama. A future president could do the same to the Biden regulations.
A group of Republican attorneys general, many of them from oil-producing states, has already challenged several of the Biden administration's climate polices, none of which are as ambitious as the proposed auto pollution regulations.
Attorney General Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia suggested on Wednesday that the group would fight the newest proposals.
Steven G. Bradbury, who served as the chief legal counsel for the Transportation Department during the Trump administration, said the regulations would amount to government overreach.
"They are using this established, longstanding statute for an entirely new purpose, to force an entirely new goal: the transformation of the industry to electric vehicles," said Mr. Bradbury, a former clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas. "This is clearly driven by the president's directive to achieve these results. I don't think you can do this. Congress never contemplated the uses of statutes in this way."
Jody Freeman, a professor of environmental law at Harvard University, who also served as a climate adviser to President Barack Obama, argued that the Clean Air Act has been used successfully for years to compel polluting industries to invest in new technologies to reduce emissions.
"All of that is part of the normal course of how E.P.A. has set standards," she said.
But she conceded that it may not be seen that way by the current Supreme Court, consisting of six judges appointed by Republican presidents, including three named to the court by Mr. Trump.
"It is a court that is very unsympathetic to regulation of any kind, and particularly hostile to the E.P.A.," Ms. Freeman said.

WASHINGTON — Aggressive rules proposed by the Biden administration to drastically speed up the country’s transition to electric vehicles, and significantly cut the auto pollution that is dangerously heating the planet, face several economic, logistical and legal challenges.
The plans, outlined Wednesday by the Environmental Protection Agency, are designed to ensure that two-thirds of new passenger cars and one-quarter of new heavy trucks sold in the United States are all-electric by 2032. If enacted as proposed, the regulations would mean a quantum leap for the auto industry in the United States, where just 5.8% of new cars and less than 2% of trucks sold last year were all-electric.
Transportation is the single largest source of greenhouse gases generated by the United States, the second-biggest polluting country after China. To head off climate catastrophe, President Joe Biden has promised to cut the nation’s emissions in half by 2030. Shrinking tailpipe emissions is key to that plan.
But to transform the American automobile industry on the scale it envisions, the Biden administration has to surmount resistance from manufacturers and consumers as well as likely legal challenges from those who consider the regulations government overreach.
One of the most important aspects of a wholesale transition to electric vehicles has to do with timing.
Although nearly every automaker has already invested billions in electrification, the proposed regulations create a dilemma: how to continue to manufacture gasoline-powered vehicles, which provide profits, while investing even more in new electric facilities. The aggressive timeline envisioned by the government means that carmakers could also struggle to source the materials required for vehicle batteries, already difficult to obtain.
Market demand is another challenge. Even with federal tax incentives of up to $7,500 for consumers, electric vehicles cost more upfront than conventional cars and trucks. At the end of 2022, the price of an average new car was $49,507 compared with $61,448 for an electric vehicle, according to the Kelley Blue Book. But even for motivated consumers who can afford electric vehicles, a major stumbling block is what’s known as range anxiety, the fear of being stranded because an electric vehicle cannot reach its destination on a single charge and not enough fast-charging stations exist.
“This was always a transformation that was going to happen over decades,” said Stephanie Brinley, an automotive analyst at S&P Global. “Putting this aggressive a timeline on it means that there are a lot of things that have to happen consecutively and concurrently.”
Looming over all of this is an all-but-certain legal and political threat: The new rules could be erased by the courts or a future president.
In many ways, the industry is already moving into an all-electric future. General Motors has set a goal of phasing out the sale of all internal combustion vehicles by 2035. Ford Motor has said it hopes EVs make up half of its sales by 2030. Volkswagen and Stellantis, the company formed through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, have similar targets. Hyundai and Nissan are also ramping up EV production.
But the proposed regulations would require even more of automakers.
Ford is on track to spend $50 billion from 2022 through 2026 on its electric vehicle production, with two battery factories under construction in Kentucky, and a third planned in Tennessee, along with an electric truck plant. In February it announced it would build a $3.5 billion battery plant in Michigan with a Chinese partner.
The automaker, however, will most likely need to spend billions more if electric vehicles are to make up two-thirds of the more than 2 million vehicles that it sells in North America annually.
The risks of accelerating the transition away from gasoline-powered vehicles are “high, if not very high,” for the industry, said Matthias Heck, a vice president at Moody’s Investors Service, “because electrification will require further substantial investments into new battery electric vehicles, battery technology, supply chain and manufacturing capacity, and charging infrastructure.”
Ford and other automakers also have not yet secured sufficient sources of lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese and other materials needed for automotive batteries, and it is unclear where they will get them.
While the Biden administration is betting that electric vehicle costs will come down with mass production, Carlos Tavares, the CEO of Stellantis, said the difficulty of sourcing materials worked against that. “The affordability is not there because the raw materials are scarce and very expensive, and, I would add, very volatile,” Tavares said at a recent conference in Detroit.

GM is in the process of eliminating 5,000 jobs as part of an effort to reduce costs by $2 billion. Ford last year began to trim about 3,000 jobs from its workforce.
“Getting to 50, 60% EVs is certainly possible,” said Sam Abuelsamid, a principal research analyst at Guidehouse Insights. “But this isn’t going to be easy. Not at all.”
And while the pace of electric vehicle purchases is ticking up, many car buyers are uncertain about the new technology.
“We’re making sales to early adopters and easy adopters, but we need to get beyond them,” said John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents large U.S. and foreign automakers. “We have a long way to go."

Biden's Risky Sprint To an Electric Future: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Government scientists have spent a year analyzing electric vehicles to help the E.P.A. design new tailpipe rules to trigger an electric car revolution.
Inside a secretive government laboratory, behind a tall fence and armed guards, a team of engineers has been dissecting the innards of the newest all-electric vehicles with a singular goal: Rewrite tailpipe pollution rules to speed up the nation's transition to electric cars.
As early as next week, the Environmental Protection Agency is expected to propose ambitious greenhouse gas emission standards for cars that are so stringent, they're designed to ensure that at least half the new vehicles sold in the United States are all-electric by 2030, up from just 5.8 percent today. And the rules could put the nation on track to end sales of new gasoline-powered cars as soon as 2035.
Transportation is the largest source of the greenhouse gases generated by the United States and scientists say that slashing pollution from tailpipes -- fast -- is essential to averting the most catastrophic impacts of global warming.
But that would also require overcoming myriad technical and logistical challenges: electric vehicles are still too expensive for most consumers, in part because of snarled global supply chains for the materials to build them. The cars also need a national network of millions of easy-to-use fast-charging stations.
The work taking place in the E.P.A.'s automotive research laboratory puts it at the center of one the most complex balancing acts faced by President Biden. He has pledged to fight climate change, and gas-burning cars are a major source of planet-warming pollution. But automobile manufacturing is one of the nation's most important industries, and a rapid switch to electric vehicles, which require less labor to manufacture, has the potential to displace thousands of auto workers, an important constituency for Mr. Biden.
"This is the biggest transformation that the auto industry has ever seen, as it moves from 100 years of tailpipe pollution to electric vehicles --- and an entirely new way to drive," said David Haugen, director of the E.P.A.'s National Fuel and Vehicle Emissions Laboratory.
"Any one thing can keep it from happening," he said, acknowledging the challenges of building charging stations, creating domestic supply chains, and bringing down prices. "Any of those things can make the adoption a struggle. All the pieces have to be there."
Testing limits
The Biden administration wants to use the E.P.A.'s authority to regulate pollution from tailpipes to set a standard so demanding, it would compel automakers to eventually produce only electric vehicles.
But to do that, experts at the E.P.A. laboratory have to first determine how much electric vehicle technology is likely to advance in the next decade, to help the agency set the strongest tailpipe emissions limits that are still achievable.
To that end, government experts in technology, chemistry, toxicology and law at the lab have been working with engineers from the world's biggest car companies. They've been taking apart and testing the innards of new and not-yet-on-the-market Teslas, GMs, Volkswagens and Nissans to figure out which existing technology can go the farthest and fastest; which is the sturdiest and most durable; and which is equipped with the most affordable technology. Different models have different strengths -- no single make possesses every component of an affordable, muscular, family-friendly, wide-ranging electric vehicle, researchers said.
They've driven electric cars on giant treadmills continuously, in 12-hour shifts, to see how many miles they can travel on a single charge. They've heated the cars to nearly 100 degrees and then frozen them overnight to assess battery strength. They've run hours and hours of computer simulations.
"Observing these technologies gives us a lot of confidence that this can happen," said Mr. Haugen. "This regulation will help all the automakers move at the fastest pace they possibly can so that we can address climate change with the urgency it deserves."
'We've never seen anything like what's coming now'
One factor weighing heavily on the administration is the effect the new tailpipe limits could have on jobs, like those at Ford's century-old Rouge manufacturing complex, about 40 miles east of the E.P.A. laboratory.
There, autoworkers and their union leaders worry about what the coming regulation means for their future. They have good reason: electric vehicles require fewer than half the number of workers to assemble than cars with internal combustion engines.
"We know we will lose jobs through this at some point," said Mark DePaoli, a vice president of the United Auto Workers Local 600, in a recent interview at the local's headquarters near the Ford plant in Dearborn.
To understand what's at stake, compare the chassis of the Ford F-150 pickup truck -- the top-selling passenger vehicle in the United States -- with its all-electric version, both built at the Rouge complex. The gas-powered F-150 is composed of thousands of small metal parts and pieces and is assembled by 4,200 employees in the conventional truck plant. The all-electric Ford F-150 is essentially a giant battery attached to motors and wheels that is built by about 720 workers next door, at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center.
As the transition from gasoline-powered to all-electric speeds up, one of the roughly 150,000 unionized auto jobs nationwide that could be lost might belong to Steve Noffke, who has built internal combustion engines for Ford for 25 years.
"I'm not opposed to electric vehicles, don't get me wrong," Mr. Noffke, 69, said. "If this transition is going to take place, we understand that; most of us have been through transitions before. But we as workers shouldn't have to pay for it."
Mr. Noffke noted that his industry has seen plenty of disruption to this point. The 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement sent thousands of auto manufacturing jobs to Mexico. The 2008 financial crisis pushed automakers to the brink of collapse. Advances in automation continue to replace people with robots.
In Dearborn, scars from some of that dislocation are still evident in empty factories, an abandoned Payless Shoes store, a boarded-up Brown's Bun Bakery.
But the changes being wrought by electric vehicles are significantly more jarring, Mr. Noffke said. "We've never seen anything like what's coming now," he said.
Angela Powell, 46, who drives a forklift in Ford's electric vehicle assembly plant, could emerge as one of the winners in the new automotive landscape.
"To come from the old building and see the new vehicles, the state-of-the-art technology, it's amazing," said Ms. Powell, who previously worked on the assembly line in Ford's conventional truck plant. "Who would have ever thought we would be here at this point? It's an exciting time."
Still, Ms. Powell worries about what will happen if the change is not managed well. If the government tries to effectively end the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035, what happens if consumers don't buy electric vehicles? What if they're too expensive, or there aren't enough charging stations, or supply chain disruptions slow down production?
"If this thing doesn't go over right, will I have a job to come into the next day?" she said.
Another concern is that many of the new electric vehicle factories and battery plants are opening in Southeastern states like Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee, where the political culture is historically hostile to organized labor, and wages and benefits are typically lower than in unionized plants.
"If you go to one of these start-ups, or even a Ford plant where that isn't a union job, you're going to be making big sacrifices economically," Mr. Noffke said.
A self-described "car guy," Mr. Biden enjoys visiting automobile factories, including the Ford plant where Ms. Powell works and where Mr. Biden took the electric F-150 for a spin and declared: "This sucker's quick."
Mr. Biden revels equally in his relationship with organized labor, calling himself the most pro-union of his predecessors. That connection to autoworkers helped Mr. Biden carry Michigan in 2020, after the state had supported Donald J. Trump in 2016. Labor's support will be crucial if Mr. Biden runs again in 2024.
Now, Mr. Biden is trying to maintain his standing with union workers at the same time he acts on climate change, an issue he has called a top priority. He has promised to cut the United States' greenhouse gas pollution at least 50 percent by 2030.
A 2021 report by the International Energy Agency found that nations would have to stop selling new gasoline-powered cars by 2035 to keep average global temperatures from increasing 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with preindustrial levels. Beyond that point, scientists say, the effects of catastrophic heat waves, flooding, drought, crop failures and species extinction become significantly harder for humanity to handle. The planet has already warmed an average of about 1.1 degrees Celsius.
"There's a vision of the future that is now beginning to happen, a future of the automobile industry that is electric -- battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, fuel cell electric," Mr. Biden said in 2021 as he announced an executive order calling for federal policies to ensure that half of new cars sold were all-electric by 2030.
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 provides up to $ 7,500 in tax credits for buyers of electric vehicles. But incentives alone won't be enough to meet the president's climate targets, which is why new E.P.A. regulations are needed, experts said.
"Nothing else ensures the transition to EVs at the pace we need to address global warming," said Drew Kodjak, executive director of the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research organization.
California, home to the nation's largest auto market, has already passed a ban on the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles after 2035. Several officials working on the new federal regulation did similar climate work in California.
But despite Mr. Biden's commitment, a transition to an all-electric future carries political and economic risks.
Representative Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat whose district includes more than a dozen auto assembly plants as well as the E.P.A. automotive lab, frequently reminds Ali Zaidi, a senior White House climate adviser, of the complexity of the situation.
Mr. Zaidi speaks to Ms. Dingell so often, she is listed as simply "DD" in his cellphone.
"I've had real heart-to-heart conversations with the president and he does understand what these workers are afraid of," said Ms. Dingell, a former executive for General Motors. "We have to make sure the policy underpinnings to be able to achieve something like this are there, without hurting people."
Mr. Biden has worked to ensure that only American-made electric vehicles would qualify for tax incentives provided by the Inflation Reduction Act -- although a requirement that they must be assembled by union workers was dropped.
In 2022, Mr. Biden signed another law providing subsidies to companies to make their electric vehicle semiconductor chips in the United States. And in 2021, he signed an infrastructure law that includes $ 7.5 billion to build half a million electric vehicle charging stations along federal highways, although a January report from S & P Global concluded that the nation would need millions more.
"There's too much at stake not to get this right," Ms. Dingell said. "But it's a very difficult balance."

ANN ARBOR, Mich. — Inside a secretive government laboratory, behind a tall fence and armed guards, a team of engineers has been dissecting the innards of the newest all-electric vehicles with a singular goal: Rewrite tailpipe-pollution rules to speed up the nation’s transition to electric cars.
As early as next week, the Environmental Protection Agency is expected to propose ambitious greenhouse gas emission standards for cars that are so stringent that they’re designed to ensure that at least half the new vehicles sold in the United States are all-electric by 2030, up from just 5.8% today. And the rules could put the nation on track to end sales of new gasoline-powered cars as soon as 2035.
Transportation is the largest source of the greenhouse gases generated by the United States, and scientists say that slashing pollution from tailpipes — fast — is essential to averting the most catastrophic impacts of global warming.
But that would also require overcoming myriad technical and logistical challenges: Electric vehicles are still too expensive for most consumers, in part because of snarled global supply chains for the materials to build them. The cars also need a national network of millions of easy-to-use fast-charging stations.
The work taking place in the EPA’s automotive research laboratory puts it at the center of one the most complex balancing acts faced by President Joe Biden. He has pledged to fight climate change, and gas-burning cars are a major source of planet-warming pollution. But automobile manufacturing is one of the nation’s most important industries, and a rapid switch to electric vehicles, which require less labor to manufacture, has the potential to displace thousands of autoworkers, an important constituency for Biden.
“This is the biggest transformation that the auto industry has ever seen, as it moves from 100 years of tailpipe pollution to electric vehicles — and an entirely new way to drive,” said David Haugen, director of EPA’s National Fuel and Vehicle Emissions Laboratory.
“Any one thing can keep it from happening,” he said, acknowledging the challenges of building charging stations, creating domestic supply chains, and bringing down prices. “Any of those things can make the adoption a struggle. All the pieces have to be there.”
Testing the limits of technology
The Biden administration wants to use the EPA’s authority to regulate pollution from tailpipes to set a standard so demanding that it would compel automakers to eventually produce only electric vehicles.
But to do that, experts at the EPA laboratory have to first determine how much electric vehicle technology is likely to advance in the next decade to help the agency set the strongest tailpipe emissions limits that are still achievable.
To that end, government experts in technology, chemistry, toxicology and law at the lab have been working with engineers from the world’s biggest car companies. They have been taking apart and testing the innards of new and not-yet-on-the-market Teslas, GMs, Volkswagens and Nissans to figure out which existing technology can go the farthest and fastest; which is the sturdiest and most durable; and which is equipped with the most affordable components. Different models have different strengths — no single make possesses every component of an affordable, muscular, family-friendly, wide-ranging electric vehicle, researchers said.
They have driven electric cars on giant treadmills continuously, in 12-hour shifts, to see how many miles they can travel on a single charge. They have heated the cars to nearly 100 degrees and then frozen them overnight to assess battery strength. They have run hours and hours of computer simulations.
“Observing these technologies gives us a lot of confidence that this can happen,” Haugen said. “This regulation will help all the automakers move at the fastest pace they possibly can so that we can address climate change with the urgency it deserves.”
‘We’ve never seen anything like what’s coming now’
One factor weighing heavily on the administration is the effect that new tailpipe limits could have on jobs, such as those at Ford’s century-old Rouge manufacturing complex, about 40 miles east of the EPA laboratory.
There, autoworkers and their union leaders worry about what the coming regulation means for their future. They have good reason: Electric vehicles require fewer than half the number of workers to assemble than cars with internal combustion engines.
“We know we will lose jobs through this at some point,” Mark DePaoli, a vice president of the United Auto Workers Local 600, said in a recent interview at the local’s headquarters, near the Ford plant in Dearborn, Michigan.
To understand what’s at stake, compare the chassis of the Ford F-150 pickup truck — the top-selling passenger vehicle in the United States — with its all-electric version, both built at the Rouge complex. The gas-powered F-150 is composed of thousands of small metal parts and pieces and is assembled by 4,200 employees in the conventional truck plant. The all-electric Ford F-150 is essentially a giant battery attached to motors and wheels that is built by about 720 workers next door, at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center.
As the transition from gasoline-powered to all-electric speeds up, one of the roughly 150,000 unionized auto jobs nationwide that could be lost might belong to Steve Noffke, who has built internal combustion engines for Ford for 25 years.
“I’m not opposed to electric vehicles, don’t get me wrong,” said Noffke, 69. “If this transition is going to take place, we understand that; most of us have been through transitions before. But we, as workers, shouldn’t have to pay for it.”
Noffke noted that his industry has seen plenty of disruption to this point. The 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement sent thousands of auto manufacturing jobs to Mexico. The 2008 financial crisis pushed automakers to the brink of collapse. Advances in automation continue to replace people with robots.
In Dearborn, scars from some of that dislocation are still evident in empty factories, an abandoned Payless Shoes store and a boarded-up Brown’s Bun Bakery.
But the changes being wrought by electric vehicles are significantly more jarring, Noffke said. “We’ve never seen anything like what’s coming now,” he said.
Angela Powell, 46, who drives a forklift in Ford’s electric vehicle assembly plant, could emerge as one of the winners in the new automotive landscape.
“To come from the old building and see the new vehicles, the state-of-the-art technology, it’s amazing,” said Powell, who previously worked on the assembly line in Ford’s conventional truck plant. “Who would have ever thought we would be here at this point? It’s an exciting time.”
Still, Powell worries about what will happen if the change is not managed well. If the government tries to effectively end the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035, what happens if consumers don’t buy electric vehicles? What if they’re too expensive, or there aren’t enough charging stations, or supply chain disruptions slow down production?
“If this thing doesn’t go over right, will I have a job to come into the next day?” she said.
Another concern is that many of the new electric vehicle factories and battery plants are opening in Southeastern states such as Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee, where the political culture is historically hostile to organized labor, and wages and benefits are typically lower than in unionized plants.
“If you go to one of these startups or even a Ford plant where that isn’t a union job, you’re going to be making big sacrifices economically,” Noffke said.
A self-described “car guy,” Biden enjoys visiting automobile factories, including the Ford plant where Powell works and where Biden took the electric F-150 for a spin and declared: “This sucker’s quick.”
Biden revels equally in his relationship with organized labor, calling himself the most pro-union of his predecessors. That connection to autoworkers helped Biden carry Michigan in 2020, after the state had supported Donald Trump in 2016. Labor’s support will be crucial if Biden runs again in 2024.
Now, Biden is trying to maintain his standing with union workers at the same time he acts on climate change, an issue he has called a top priority. He has promised to cut the United States' greenhouse gas pollution at least 50% by 2030.
A 2021 report by the International Energy Agency found that nations would have to stop selling new gasoline-powered cars by 2035 to keep average global temperatures from increasing 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with preindustrial levels. Beyond that point, scientists say, the effects of catastrophic heat waves, flooding, drought, crop failures and species extinction become significantly harder for humanity to handle. The planet has already warmed an average of about 1.1 degrees Celsius.
“There’s a vision of the future that is now beginning to happen, a future of the automobile industry that is electric — battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, fuel-cell electric,” Biden said in 2021 as he announced an executive order calling for federal policies to ensure that half of new cars sold were all-electric by 2030.
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 provides up to $7,500 in tax credits for buyers of electric vehicles. But incentives alone won’t be enough to meet Biden’s climate targets, which is why new EPA regulations are needed, experts said.
“Nothing else ensures the transition to EVs at the pace we need to address global warming,” said Drew Kodjak, executive director of the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research organization.
California, home to the nation’s largest auto market, has already passed a ban on the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles after 2035. Several officials working on the new federal regulation did similar climate work in California.
But despite Biden’s commitment, a transition to an all-electric future carries political and economic risks.
Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich, whose district includes more than a dozen auto assembly plants as well as the EPA automotive lab, frequently reminds Ali Zaidi, a senior White House climate adviser, of the complexity of the situation.
Zaidi speaks to Dingell so often that she is listed as simply “DD” in his cellphone.
“I’ve had real heart-to-heart conversations with the president and he does understand what these workers are afraid of,” said Dingell, a former executive for General Motors. “We have to make sure the policy underpinnings to be able to achieve something like this are there, without hurting people.”
Biden has worked to ensure that only American-made electric vehicles would qualify for tax incentives provided by the Inflation Reduction Act — although a requirement that they must be assembled by union workers was dropped.
In 2022, Biden signed another law providing subsidies to companies to make their electric vehicle semiconductor chips in the United States. And in 2021, he signed an infrastructure law that includes $7.5 billion to build a half-million electric vehicle charging stations along federal highways, although a January report from S&P Global concluded that the nation would need millions more.
“There’s too much at stake not to get this right,” Dingell said. “But it’s a very difficult balance.”

General Motors Reports Raise in Quarterly Sales, Citing a Robust Demand: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: General Motors and several rivals cited robust demand in the first quarter. But affordability is a growing challenge for many buyers.
Automakers have mostly overcome the supply-chain challenges that upended production early in the pandemic. Now they are trying to weather a new challenge: higher borrowing costs for their customers.
General Motors and several other automakers reported on Monday that new-vehicle sales increased substantially in the first three months of the year, thanks to improved supplies of key components and firm demand from both consumers and commercial customers.
But the steady interest rate increases in the last 12 months have raised questions about whether the industry can maintain its sales momentum throughout 2023.
Jonathan Smoke, the chief economist at the market research firm Cox Automotive, said higher rates were already starting to put new vehicles out of the reach of buyers with lower incomes or weaker credit scores.
According to Cox, "subprime" borrowers -- those with weaker credit profiles -- make up just under 6 percent of all new-car purchases, down from 18 percent five years ago. Car buyers paid an average interest rate of 8.95 percent last month, up from 5.66 percent in March 2022.
The average monthly payment on new vehicles was $ 784 in February, compared with $ 681 a year earlier, Cox calculated.
"Affordability challenges are limiting access to the vehicle market," Mr. Smoke said. "Higher interest rates are having a huge impact."
Sticker prices have also challenged buyers. Auto prices -- for new and used vehicles alike -- have been a prominent driver of inflation over the last two years, although there are signs they are cooling off. The average price for a new car or light truck in February was $ 48,763, according to Cox -- up from $ 46,297 a year earlier, but down from $ 49,468 in January.
Mr. Smoke said automakers got off to a strong start in January and February, but saw credit tighten somewhat in March after the banking industry was shaken by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.
G.M. said its new-vehicle sales in the United States rose 18 percent in the first three months of the year, to 603,208 cars and trucks. Sales to consumers rose 15 percent and sales to rental, corporate and government fleet customers increased 27 percent.
In the last several months, G.M. has been able to keep its factories humming as a result of steadier supplies of computer chips and other critical parts. The company ended the quarter with 412,285 vehicles in dealer stocks, up slightly from what it had at the end of 2022, but nearly 140,000 more than it had a year earlier.
Honda Motor reported that its U.S. sales increased 7 percent to 284,507 cars and trucks, while Nissan saw a gain of 17 percent, to 235,818. Hyundai said its U.S. sales rose 16 percent to 184,449.
Toyota Motor, however, has continued to suffered from parts shortages that have left its dealers with slim inventories. Its first-quarter sales fell 9 percent to 469,558 cars and trucks. Stellantis, formed through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot SA, also reported a decline. Its sales fell 9 percent to 368,327 cars and trucks.
Ford Motor is scheduled to report its latest sales figures on Tuesday.
G.M. has forecast a rapid increase this year in sales of electric vehicles; so far, it is off to an uneven start. The company sold 19,700 Chevrolet Bolt compacts in the first quarter, more than three times the total a year earlier, but other models have yet to make a splash.
Sales of the Cadillac Lyriq, an electric sport-utility vehicle, totaled just 968, and G.M. sold only two GMC Hummer E.V.s, down from 99 in the first quarter of 2022.
G.M. started production last summer at a new plant in Ohio that is supposed to provide battery packs for the Hummer E.V., the Lyriq and several other vehicles scheduled to arrive in showrooms this year. They include electric versions of the Chevrolet Silverado pickup and the Chevy Equinox and Blazer S.U.V.s.

Teenage Driver in Crash That Killed 5 Children Didn't Have License, Officials Say: [National Desk]

Full text: Malik Smith, 16, may have been distracted or asleep when the rented vehicle he was driving veered off a New York parkway, officials said.
A 16-year-old driving a car that crashed on a New York highway, killing him and four young passengers, did not have a driver's license or learner's permit and may have been distracted or asleep when he drove off the road, officials said on Monday.
Details of the deadly crash emerged as Westchester County, N.Y., officials identified the driver, Malik Smith, and the other victims, including two pairs of siblings: Anthony Billips Jr., 17, and Andrew Billips, 8; and Zahnyiah Cross, 12, and Shawnell Cross, 11.
A fifth passenger, Abraham Billips, 9, survived after sustaining injuries that were not life-threatening, officials said.
"We grieve with the families that are involved," George Latimer, the Westchester County executive, said at a news conference. Of the victims, he added: "These are individuals who had their whole life ahead of them."
The victims' relationships to one another were not immediately clear, but Mr. Latimer said "it was understood" that their family had recently moved to Derby, Conn., from New York City and that the children may have been traveling to Connecticut when the crash occurred.
Malik Smith was enrolled at a Brooklyn high school and the other children had not yet enrolled in the Derby schools, Mr. Latimer said.
"The crash cost the lives of five young people," he said. "And that is a tragedy no matter what the details are."
The collision occurred just before 12:30 a.m. Sunday as the car traveled north on the Hutchinson River Parkway, near the Mamaroneck Road exit in Scarsdale, Mr. Latimer said. At that point in the road, he said, the parkway curves slightly to the left and dips downhill.
Rather than follow the curve, the vehicle continued straight, hitting a boulder and then a tree before bursting into flames, Mr. Latimer said. Speed did not appear to be a factor, and there was no indication that another vehicle was involved in the crash, he said.
Investigators believe the driver was either distracted or had fallen asleep when he left the road, Mr. Latimer said. Toxicology reports to determine if alcohol or drugs might have played a role were pending, he said.
Abraham Billips, who survived, was riding in the rear cargo area and was able to escape through the broken hatchback window before fire engulfed the vehicle, Mr. Latimer said.
A driver who saw the car go off the road pulled over and called the boy's mother, Terrance Raynor, the county's acting public safety commissioner, said.
Relatives of the victims either could not be reached on Monday or did not respond immediately to requests for comment.
The vehicle that crashed, a 2021 Nissan Rogue, had been rented by a relative, and investigators were exploring how Malik Smith came to be at the wheel, Mr. Latimer said. Because of his age, he would have been prohibited from driving at night, even with a permit and a licensed driver in the car, officials said.
Mr. Raynor said the crash investigation was "not criminal in nature."
"As you can imagine, this family is very distraught over the incident, and we have had some conversations," he said. "However, there's a lot of follow-up conversations to be had with the family. So at this point, I can say that they've been cooperative with respect to the questions we've asked."

2 Navy Ships Will Receive New Names: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The vessels will be named for Robert Smalls, a mariner who commandeered a Confederate ship to freedom from slavery, and Marie Tharp, an ocean geologist who studied continental drift.
One night in 1862, as the Civil War raged, an enslaved mariner named Robert Smalls seized an opportunity.
When the enlisted crew of a Confederate steamer disembarked for a night of carousing in Charleston, S.C., Mr. Smalls, the ship's pilot, gathered his family and the other enslaved sailors and their families. He then steered the ship for a dramatic escape past heavy fortifications to Union-controlled waters and freedom.
Disguised in a top hat and a Confederate captain's long overcoat, Mr. Smalls gave the passcodes at each of five Confederate forts and, once past the reach of cannon fire, hoisted a white flag of sewn-together bedsheets that his wife Hannah had made -- delivering the ship to Union forces.
Mr. Smalls and the crew had lined the bottom of the boat with explosives to detonate rather than be recaptured and face execution.
Now Mr. Smalls will be immortalized on a U.S. Navy warship named after him, as will Marie Tharp, a pioneering ocean geologist. Both are receiving broader recognition under a Pentagon program to rid military installations and other property of Confederate ties.
The Naming Commission, a committee created by Congress in response to a public backlash against Confederate memorials in the wake of the 2020 murder of George Floyd, identified two ships to be rechristened in the Navy's fleet.
One, a warship deployed in the waters off Japan, called the U.S.S. Chancellorsville after the Confederate Civil War victory in Virginia, will be renamed the U.S.S. Robert Smalls.
The other, a Pathfinder-class oceanographic survey ship called the U.S.N.S. Maury, was named after Matthew Fontaine Maury, a U.S. Navy commander who resigned in 1861 to join the Confederate Navy during the Civil War and who is known as "Pathfinder of the Seas" for his work charting the global paths of ocean currents. It will be rechristened the U.S.N.S. Marie Tharp, after the ocean cartographer, who helped document the phenomenon of continental drift.
When the Naming Commission informed the Navy that it would have four assets to rename -- two buildings at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., and two ships -- dozens of suggestions flooded Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro's office, said Tralene Hunston, a civilian employee in the public affairs office.
The Navy is planning namesake ceremonies that do not disrupt operations of either ship, Ms. Hunston said.
The ships were renamed after two people who "have historically been overlooked, but leveled significant impact on not just our Navy, but also the nation," Mr. Del Toro said in emailed comments to The New York Times.
"It's a wonderful honor for my family and for Robert's legacy," said Michael Moore, Mr. Smalls's great-great-grandson and a businessman in Charleston, S.C. "I think it's an appropriate elevation of a true American hero."
Mr. Smalls was born to an enslaved woman, Lydia Polite, in 1839, on a plantation in Beaufort, S.C. As part of the Gullah community, made up of descendants of West African enslaved people, he grew up on the water, learning to fish, build and sail a boat at a young age, Mr. Moore said.
He was working as an enslaved pilot of a steamer ship when war was declared. After his daring escape, he fought for the Union, becoming the first Black American to command a Navy vessel. After the war, he represented South Carolina in Congress, owned a newspaper and founded a railroad.
"At a time in which there was so much that needed to be done in America, he rolled up his sleeves and stepped in and made an enormous difference. He led a life of extraordinary consequence," said Mr. Moore, who said he is planning to run for his relative's congressional seat.
The eponymous oceanographer, Ms. Tharp, was pioneering in her field, creating the first scientific maps of the Atlantic Ocean's floor and helping to shape the U.S. military's understanding of plate tectonics and continental drift, with some of her research funded by the Navy.
Born in 1920, Ms. Tharp took advantage of a change in university admissions allowing women to enroll during World War II to receive an education that until then had been restricted to men. Ms. Tharp and a colleague studied sonar data taken from the research vessel of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the Atlantis, to create highly detailed seafloor profiles and maps.
Ms. Tharp noticed a cleft in the ocean floor that she hypothesized to be a rift valley that ran along the ridge crest and continued along the length of its axis, which she posited (and was later proven) to be evidence of continental drift.
"I had a blank canvas to fill with extraordinary possibilities, a fascinating jigsaw puzzle to piece together: mapping the world's vast hidden seafloor," Ms. Tharp wrote in a book about the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, where she once worked. "It was a once-in-the-history-of-the-world opportunity for anyone, but especially for a woman in the 1940s."
The significance of her contributions would become evident as research in her field continued over the decades, others said.
"For most of her working career, her contributions weren't really celebrated. Her intellectual contributions were discounted," Maureen Raymo, dean of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, said, even though her "evidence of sea floor spreading was probably the biggest scientific revolution of the 20th century, certainly in earth sciences."
The vessels' renaming is part of a broader Pentagon project to grapple with a legacy that for more than a century has paid homage to Confederate victories and leaders.
Naming Army bases and other military property, and erecting monuments and memorials, to honor the Confederacy was part of a campaign by the children of Confederate soldiers "to reimagine their fathers as not the villains of a treasonous war for slavery but instead for the Southern way of life," said Michel Paradis, a lecturer at Columbia University.
President Woodrow Wilson, an ardent segregationist, saw granting the requests to honor Confederate soldiers as a good way to rally support among his southern base during a draft for World War I, Paradis said.
In the protests that broke out across the U.S. after Mr. Floyd's death in the summer of 2020, demonstrators took down dozens of Confederate memorials and monuments. That summer, Congress voted to expunge from Defense Department assets "names, symbols, displays, monuments and paraphernalia" that commemorate the Confederate States of America. The same legislation established the Naming Commission, which quickly proposed new names for nine Army installations in the South.
In September 2022, it produced a report with recommendations to rename 1,111 places from bases to ships to monuments, according to a committee member, the retired Brig. Gen. Ty Seidule, emeritus history professor at West Point and professor at Hamilton College.
Mr. Del Toro said both Mr. Smalls and Ms. Tharp were among people whose work was worthy of historical recognition.
"Last year I visited Robert Smalls's home and I knew his courageous endeavors in the face of the most harrowing scenarios, for me, made him the right choice for the renaming of the former U.S.S. Chancellorsville," Mr. Del Toro said.
"Marie Tharp, as a pioneering oceanographer who had her work dismissed for most of her career, was also the right candidate for the renaming of the former U.S.N.S. Maury, a ship tasked with continuing her life's work," he added.
Many of the Confederate names that remain are attached to Army posts, Professor Seidule said, because the Civil War was largely fought on land.
"When the posts were being named in World War I and World War II, and the South was a one-party apartheid state, they would name them for people in their local community, these Confederate soldiers," he said.
"It's not just about getting rid of names. Whom you choose to honor is who you value," he added. "I would be incredibly proud to serve on the U.S.S. Robert Smalls."

Full text: Enlarge this image.
One night in 1862, as the Civil War raged, an enslaved mariner named Robert Smalls seized an opportunity.
When the enlisted crew of a Confederate steamer disembarked for a night of carousing in Charleston, South Carolina, Smalls, the ship’s pilot, gathered his family and the other enslaved sailors and their families. He then steered the ship for a dramatic escape past heavy fortifications to Union-controlled waters and freedom.
Disguised in a top hat and a Confederate captain’s long overcoat, Smalls gave the passcodes at each of five Confederate forts and, once past the reach of cannon fire, hoisted a white flag of sewn-together bedsheets that his wife, Hannah, had made — delivering the ship to Union forces.
Smalls and the crew had lined the bottom of the boat with dynamite to detonate rather than be recaptured and face execution.
Now, Smalls will be immortalized on a U.S. Navy warship named after him, as will Marie Tharp, a pioneering ocean geologist. Both are receiving broader recognition under a Pentagon program to rid military installations and other property of Confederate ties.
The Naming Commission, a committee created by Congress in response to a public backlash against Confederate memorials in the wake of the 2020 murder of George Floyd, identified two ships to be rechristened in the Navy’s fleet.
One, a warship deployed in the waters off Japan, called the USS Chancellorsville after the Confederate Civil War victory in Virginia, will be renamed the USS Robert Smalls.
The other, a Pathfinder-class oceanographic survey ship called the USNS Maury, was named after Matthew Fontaine Maury, a U.S. Navy commander who resigned in 1861 to join the Confederate Navy during the Civil War and who is known as “Pathfinder of the Seas” for his work charting the global paths of ocean currents. It will be rechristened the USNS Marie Tharp, after the ocean cartographer who helped document the phenomenon of continental drift.
When the Naming Commission informed the Navy that it would have four assets to rename — two buildings at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, and two ships — dozens of suggestions flooded Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro’s office, said Tralene Hunston, a civilian employee in the public affairs office.
The Navy is planning namesake ceremonies that do not disrupt operations of either ship, Hunston said.
The ships were renamed after two people who “have historically been overlooked, but leveled significant impact on not just our Navy, but also the nation,” Del Toro said in emailed comments to The New York Times.
“It’s a wonderful honor for my family and for Robert’s legacy,” said Michael Moore, Smalls’ great-great-grandson and a businessman in Charleston. “I think it’s an appropriate elevation of a true American hero.”
Smalls was born to an enslaved woman, Lydia Polite, in 1839, on a plantation in Beaufort, South Carolina. As part of the Gullah community, made up of descendants of West African enslaved people, he grew up on the water, learning to fish, build and sail a boat at a young age, Moore said.

The Lens of Tyre Nichols Bared a City's Vivid Soul: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: MEMPHIS -- Steel bridges curving over calm water. Neon lights pulsing above blues clubs. A fiery sun melting into a bank of clouds.
Through the lens of Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old aspiring photographer who loved skateboarding, Memphis was a landscape of unexpected color punctuated by moments of stillness.
In 2020, Mr. Nichols moved to the Tennessee city on the banks of the Mississippi River from his hometown of Sacramento after the end of a relationship. He joined his mother and stepfather in Memphis.
Mr. Nichols was only beginning to find his footing in the city, friends said, when he died in January, three days after he was stopped by Memphis Police officers and brutally beaten.
Nearly two months later, the investigation into Mr. Nichols's death has embroiled the Police Department and members of the city's emergency services. Six officers, as well as two E.M.T.s and a lieutenant with the fire department, have been fired.
By many measures, Memphis has struggled in recent years. It has one of the highest crime rates in the country and is one of the most racially segregated cities. Some swaths of downtown sit vacant.
But through his photos, Mr. Nichols showed another side of Memphis: a vibrant city steeped in music and surrounded by nature. He captured murals painted along the streets, blue skies framed by pedestrian bridges and sunsets reflected in the wide expanse of the Mississippi.
Some of Mr. Nichols's photography is presented here, with the permission of his mother, along with scenes from Memphis captured after Mr. Nichols's death by a New York Times photographer.
Mr. Nichols's photos offer a glimpse into his relationship with his new home. On Beale Street, Mr. Nichols took in the bright lights of the city's cultural artery, where blues and rock 'n' roll spill out onto the streets at night. But his eye was most often drawn to nature. At Shelby Farms Park, a sprawling 4,500-acre green space on the outskirts of the city, he spent long hours along its winding trails, vast fields and shimmering lakes, where great blue herons glide across the water.
"Tyre was different," said Rico Howard, 57, a close friend of Mr. Nichols and his family. "He caught a part of Memphis that we all had never thought about catching."
Mr. Nichols's transition to Memphis was rocky at first, said Angelina Paxton, 28, a childhood friend from Sacramento. She said he felt lonely, especially being far away from his young son. His days revolved around his evening shift at FedEx and his mother's house, where he took his 7 p.m. meal breaks.
Ms. Paxton worried about him. Mr. Nichols had stopped skateboarding, and the occasional contact with hometown friends had become infrequent, she said.
She had been close friends with Mr. Nichols since they met in high school, when they bonded over photography. Mr. Nichols would tag along on Ms. Paxton's long trips through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, twisting through a maze of dirt roads in search of a good shot of the sunset.
Soon after, he bought a point-and-shoot camera and started taking photos of his own. For Mr. Nichols and Ms. Paxton, both self-described introverts, those hours spent watching the sun set over the water were meditative.
"That was our kind of church," she said. "It took him some time, but I think he found those same kinds of places in Memphis, where he could just be still."
Mr. Nichols eventually started to venture out into his new city, Ms. Paxton said, pushing past his comfort zone to find his own corners of Memphis.
Around the summer of 2021, he pulled up to a Starbucks in Germantown, a suburb of the city, in his bright blue Nissan Sentra, blasting the rock band AC/DC with the windows rolled down. He caught the attention of Perry Williams, 60, a cafe regular sitting outside. They fell into conversation and became fast friends.
Most mornings, Mr. Nichols joined Mr. Williams and a half-dozen others in a sunny corner of the cafe's patio, chatting leisurely. They called the area the "No Judgment Zone," and the table around which they sat "The Love Table."
"We'd just sit out there and drink our coffee and talk about the flavor of the day," said Nate Spates Jr., 42.
Mr. Nichols was much younger than the other members of the group, but he fell naturally into their easy rapport. He would often swing his legs over an arm of the chair, sipping on a large caramel macchiato with almond milk and extra caramel, friends said.
Mr. Spates said that Mr. Nichols reminded him of a younger version of himself. Like Mr. Nichols, Mr. Spates had moved to Memphis as a young man and had been interested in the arts, particularly photography.
"It was like looking in the mirror at myself 13 years earlier," Mr. Spates said. "Just trying to find out who you are, what you want to do with this life of yours."
Eventually, Mr. Nichols began spending time at a skate park in the Memphis region. At Tobey Skate Park, a concrete expanse of ramps, stairs, bowls and rails east of downtown, skaters said Mr. Nichols impressed them with his smooth, relaxed style of riding and his laid-back demeanor. He was known to hype up fellow skaters, shouting support when they landed a new move.
Kameron Blakely, 25, said he met Mr. Nichols a few times at Tobey, where they would cheer each other on. Mr. Blakely's skateboard is now stenciled with "Justice for Tyre Nichols."
"I wanted it to be a constant reminder every time that I hop on the board," he said.
Many friends and relatives have reflected on Mr. Nichols's singular vision of Memphis. His photographs highlighted peaceful corners of the city that some longtime residents said had faded into their periphery. At his funeral on Feb. 1, mourners viewed his images of sunsets and bridges on screens in the church sanctuary.
Mr. Nichols often declined invitations to go out to bars or clubs, said Mr. Howard, Mr. Nichols's friend and a co-worker at FedEx. But on Beale Street, he turned his lens to the flickering pink forks of the Blues City Cafe, the oversize Gibson guitar of the Hard Rock Cafe and the neon four-leaf clover of the Irish bar Silky O'Sullivan's.
"He wasn't trying to fit in," Mr. Howard said. "He was his own person, and he changed me."
Mr. Nichols rarely shared his photography publicly, Ms. Paxton said.
His online portfolio went mostly untouched until about a year before his death, when he started posting, filling the website with images of his favorite parts of Memphis.
"My vision is to bring my viewers deep into what I am seeing through my eye and out through my lens," he wrote on the site.
Ms. Paxton was thrilled to see his newfound confidence.
"It was the first real proof that he was starting to find joy again," she said.
Other friends noticed the shift in him, too. In his final months, Mr. Nichols seemed optimistic about the future, members of the Starbucks group said. He talked about buying a drone to take aerial landscape photographs, securing his own apartment and traveling to Las Vegas.
"It was just simple stuff that would make a huge difference in his world," Mr. Spates said. About a week before his friend's death, he recalled Mr. Nichols being excited about getting new tires for his car.
Mr. Spates said he has not been able to bring himself to watch the video of Mr. Nichols's beating. But he has returned to their cafe regularly, each time expecting Mr. Nichols to reappear.
"It brings a lot of peace and solace just to sit with the crew and talk about him and laugh," he said. "It's almost like he's not even gone. It's like he's just not here today."

Full text: A haunting horror novel set a century ago in the American West, Eleanor Catton's first novel in a decade, a Ukrainian war diary and much more.
Biography of X, by Catherine Lacey
After her wife, X -- a controversial interdisciplinary artist -- dies, a former reporter sets out to write her biography. X was always circumspect about the details of her life and she harmed even those closest to her. As she writes, her widow encounters information that turns everything she knew about the woman she loved on its head. The resulting book is a novel masquerading as a fictionalized biography and painful emotional inquiry.
Farrar, Straus and Giroux, March 21
Birnam Wood, by Eleanor Catton
Catton returns with her first novel in 10 years, after her debut, "The Luminaries," won the Booker Prize. In New Zealand, Mira runs Birnam Wood, a "guerrilla gardening group" that plants food and flowers on land where they think no one will notice -- their way of cultivating sustenance outside a capitalist system. When Mira makes a pact with a tech billionaire to secure the group's future, it sets the groundwork for a collision of values.
Farrar, Straus and Giroux, March 7
Flux, by Jinwoo Chong
The lives of three characters converge in this time-traveling debut novel. They're all grieving in some fashion -- Bo's mother died when he was a child, Brandon lost his job and Blue is struggling to reconnect with his family. Along the way, the novel brings in the story of a famous detective show, giving it a noirish, and speculative, bent.
Melville House, March 21
Hello Beautiful, by Ann Napolitano
There are some subtle parallels with "Little Women" in Napolitano's latest novel, which follows the relationship between William, who grew up in an emotionally chilly home, and Julia. Julia's family -- particularly her three sisters -- is warm, mildly chaotic and creative, with each sister playing a specific role (the dreamer, the caregiver). After William and Julia's marriage unravels, the family confronts an existential crisis as their loyalty and love are tested.
Dial Press, March 14
Humanly Possible: Seven Hundred Years of Humanist Freethinking, Inquiry, and Hope, by Sarah Bakewell
In her earlier books, "At the Existentialist Café" and "How to Live," Bakewell introduced readers to the major questions facing the existentialist philosophers. Now, she looks at the long tradition of humanism -- which poses the deceptively simple question of what it means to be human -- weighing the importance of moral versus cultural output, and putting a wide array of thinkers across time and place in dialogue.
Penguin Press, March 28
Lone Women, by Victor LaValle
This new book from the author of "The Changeling" reads like a Western horror story. It's 1915 California, and Adelaide, a young Black woman, flees for Montana after her parents die, hoping to become a homesteader. At first, she is welcomed there, but the unbearable secrets of her past -- symbolized by the mysterious steamer trunk she lugs with her -- threaten her new life.
One World, March 28
The New Earth, by Jess Row
In this new novel, a white, Jewish Manhattan family is rocked by the revelation that its matriarch is half-Black. Soon after, one of the children, working as an activist in the West Bank, is killed by an Israeli soldier. A wedding forces the remaining family members to confront these wounds and decide whether they can rebuild, playing with themes that Row has raised in his earlier writing; his essay collection, "White Flights," looked at what American literature could -- and couldn't -- tell readers about race in the United States.
Ecco, March 28
The Odyssey of Phillis Wheatley: A Poet's Journeys Through American Slavery and Independence, by David Waldstreicher
Wheatley was a young child when she arrived in the United States from West Africa and was sold to a Boston family. Within years, she became the most prominent African American poet of the 18th century. Other studies of her life have focused on her role in trans-Atlantic literature, but Waldstreicher makes the point that beyond that, she was a brilliant writer who was, as Waldstreicher puts it, an "organic intellectual of the enslaved."
Farrar, Straus and Giroux, March 7
Pineapple Street, by Jenny Jackson
In her debut novel, a book editor follows a stratospherically wealthy Brooklyn Heights family as they navigate questions of privilege, love and belonging. (A representative piece of dialogue: "Oh no! I left my Cartier bracelet in Lena's BMW and she's leaving soon for her grandmother's house in Southampton!")
Pamela Dorman Books, March 7
Poverty, by America, by Matthew Desmond
In his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, "Evicted," Desmond, a sociologist, looked at how the wave of evictions after the 2008 financial crash helped engender cycles of poverty. Now, he investigates income inequality in the United States, arguing that the behavior and decisions of wealthy Americans has caused the poverty crisis to endure. He puts it bluntly: "Tens of millions of Americans do not end up poor by a mistake of history or personal conduct. Poverty persists because some wish and will it to."

Odell's previous book, "How to Do Nothing," set off a cultural reckoning: She argued that attention is our most precious resource -- and that to honor its importance, we should invest it in solitude and contemplation. Now, she looks at our understanding of time itself, examining its links to modern ideas around productivity and even climate change.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. — Steel bridges curving over calm water. Neon lights pulsing above blues clubs. A fiery sun melting into a bank of clouds.
Through the lens of Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old aspiring photographer who loved skateboarding, Memphis was a landscape of unexpected color punctuated by moments of stillness.
In 2020, Nichols moved to the Tennessee city on the banks of the Mississippi River from his hometown of Sacramento, California, after the end of a relationship. He joined his mother and stepfather in Memphis.
Nichols was only beginning to find his footing in the city, friends said, when he died in January, three days after he was stopped by Memphis Police officers and brutally beaten.
Nearly two months later, the investigation into Nichols’ death has embroiled the Police Department and members of the city’s emergency services. Six officers, as well as two EMTs and a lieutenant with the fire department, have been fired.
By many measures, Memphis has struggled in recent years. It has one of the highest crime rates in the country and is one of the most racially segregated cities. Some swaths of downtown sit vacant.
But through his photos, Nichols showed another side of Memphis: a vibrant city steeped in music and surrounded by nature. He captured murals painted along the streets, blue skies framed by pedestrian bridges and sunsets reflected in the wide expanse of the Mississippi.
Nichols’ photos offer a glimpse into his relationship with his new home. On Beale Street, Nichols took in the bright lights of the city’s cultural artery, where blues and rock ’n’ roll spill out onto the streets at night. But his eye was most often drawn to nature. At Shelby Farms Park, a sprawling 4,500-acre green space on the outskirts of the city, he spent long hours along its winding trails, vast fields and shimmering lakes, where great blue herons glide across the water.
“Tyre was different,” said Rico Howard, 57, a close friend of Nichols and his family. “He caught a part of Memphis that we all had never thought about catching.”
Nichols’ transition to Memphis was rocky at first, said Angelina Paxton, 28, a childhood friend from Sacramento. She said he felt lonely, especially being far away from his young son. His days revolved around his evening shift at FedEx and his mother’s house, where he took his 7 p.m. meal breaks.
Paxton worried about him. Nichols had stopped skateboarding, and the occasional contact with hometown friends had become infrequent, she said.
She had been close friends with Nichols since they met in high school, when they bonded over photography. Nichols would tag along on Paxton’s long trips through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, twisting through a maze of dirt roads in search of a good shot of the sunset.
Soon after, he bought a point-and-shoot camera and started taking photos of his own. For Nichols and Paxton, both self-described introverts, those hours spent watching the sun set over the water were meditative.
“That was our kind of church,” she said. “It took him some time, but I think he found those same kinds of places in Memphis, where he could just be still.”
Nichols eventually started to venture out into his new city, Paxton said, pushing past his comfort zone to find his own corners of Memphis.
Around the summer of 2021, he pulled up to a Starbucks in Germantown, a suburb of the city, in his bright blue Nissan Sentra, blasting the rock band AC/DC with the windows rolled down. He caught the attention of Perry Williams, 60, a cafe regular sitting outside. They fell into conversation and became fast friends.
Most mornings, Nichols joined Williams and a half-dozen others in a sunny corner of the cafe’s patio, chatting leisurely. They called the area the “No Judgment Zone,” and the table around which they sat “The Love Table.”
“We’d just sit out there and drink our coffee and talk about the flavor of the day,” said Nate Spates Jr., 42.
Nichols was much younger than the other members of the group, but he fell naturally into their easy rapport. He would often swing his legs over an arm of the chair, sipping on a large caramel macchiato with almond milk and extra caramel, friends said.
Spates said that Nichols reminded him of a younger version of himself. Like Nichols, Spates had moved to Memphis as a young man and had been interested in the arts, particularly photography.
“It was like looking in the mirror at myself 13 years earlier,” Spates said. “Just trying to find out who you are, what you want to do with this life of yours.”
Eventually, Nichols began spending time at a skate park in the Memphis region. At Tobey Skate Park, a concrete expanse of ramps, stairs, bowls and rails east of downtown, skaters said Nichols impressed them with his smooth, relaxed style of riding and his laid-back demeanor. He was known to hype up fellow skaters, shouting support when they landed a new move.
Kameron Blakely, 25, said he met Nichols a few times at Tobey, where they would cheer each other on. Blakely’s skateboard is now stenciled with “Justice for Tyre Nichols.”
“I wanted it to be a constant reminder every time that I hop on the board,” he said.
Many friends and relatives have reflected on Nichols’ singular vision of Memphis. His photographs highlighted peaceful corners of the city that some longtime residents said had faded into their periphery. At his funeral on Feb. 1, mourners viewed his images of sunsets and bridges on screens in the church sanctuary.
Nichols often declined invitations to go out to bars or clubs, said Howard, Nichols’ friend and a co-worker at FedEx. But on Beale Street, he turned his lens to the flickering pink forks of the Blues City Cafe, the oversize Gibson guitar of the Hard Rock Cafe and the neon four-leaf clover of the Irish bar Silky O’Sullivan’s.
“He wasn’t trying to fit in,” Howard said. “He was his own person, and he changed me.”
Nichols rarely shared his photography publicly, Paxton said.
His online portfolio went mostly untouched until about a year before his death, when he started posting, filling the website with images of his favorite parts of Memphis.
“My vision is to bring my viewers deep into what I am seeing through my eye and out through my lens,” he wrote on the site.
Paxton was thrilled to see his newfound confidence.
“It was the first real proof that he was starting to find joy again,” she said.
Other friends noticed the shift in him, too. In his final months, Nichols seemed optimistic about the future, members of the Starbucks group said. He talked about buying a drone to take aerial landscape photographs, securing his own apartment and traveling to Las Vegas.
“It was just simple stuff that would make a huge difference in his world,” Spates said. About a week before his friend’s death, he recalled Nichols being excited about getting new tires for his car.
Spates said he has not been able to bring himself to watch the video of Nichols’ beating. But he has returned to their cafe regularly, each time expecting Nichols to reappear.
“It brings a lot of peace and solace just to sit with the crew and talk about him and laugh,” he said. “It’s almost like he’s not even gone. It’s like he’s just not here today.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Sake Moves Into the American Mainstream: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: When Shinobu Kato first tried sake as a young man in Tokyo, it tasted harsh and sharp to him. He hated it. But, he recalls, an older colleague told him that he was drinking cheap, poorly made sake. As he was introduced to better styles, Mr. Kato grew to love it.
When he moved to the United States in 2004 to study business at the University of Maryland, he could afford only the sorts of bad sake that had left such a terrible first impression. So he decided to brew his own, steaming and fermenting rice in his kitchen. To his surprise, he and his friends adored it.
Mr. Kato continued brewing sake after he moved to Nashville to work for Nissan. He grew so passionate about sake that, in 2016, with the encouragement of his wife, Ayako, he moved to Bushwick, Brooklyn, with the aim of opening his own sake brewery.
He equipped himself with small stainless steel vats from a brewery supply house, bought special rice grown in California and ordered yeast and other necessities by mail from Japan. Finally, in April 2020, just weeks into the Covid lockdown, Kato Sake Works opened in a tiny, 500-square-foot industrial space in Bushwick.
It now sells four different kinds of sake, with numerous special batches. The brewery has done so well, Mr. Kato said, that it will soon move to a new space five times as big.
Mr. Kato's timing could hardly be better. Sake sales are booming around the world and in the United States. Exports from Japan more than doubled in volume from 2012 to 2022, from roughly 14 million liters per year to nearly 36 million liters, according to the Japanese Sake and Shochu Makers Association, a trade group. Exports to the United States in that period grew to more than nine million liters per year, up from just under four million liters.
Paradoxically, as the popularity of sake rises elsewhere, it is declining in Japan. The population is aging, people are drinking less in general and younger people have yet to take up sake, said Chicako Ichihara, the New York liaison officer for the sake makers' association. Still, she said, sales of premium sake are stable. It's the cheaper stuff, the sort of sake that Mr. Kato first tasted, that fewer people are buying.
For years, sake proponents have proclaimed that it would be the next big thing in the American alcoholic beverage market. But it never took off, even as other categories, like tequila and natural wines, grew from niche markets to the mainstream. Now, though, evidence of a leap seems to be all over.
Brooklyn Kura, a sake brewery in the waterfront complex Industry City, is expanding in partnership with Hakkaisan Brewery, a Japanese sake producer. Asahi Shuzo, which makes the Japanese sake brand Dassai, is constructing an American brewery in Hyde Park, N.Y., to produce Dassai Blue, a brand for the United States market. It is expected to open this year.
In Hot Springs, Ark., a 24,000-square-foot brewery for Origami Sake -- almost 10 times the size of Kato's new brewery -- is scheduled to open in May. Master brewers from Nanbu Bijin, a Japanese brewery, will act as advisers, but the financing and ownership is American.
"It will be the largest U.S.-owned brewery, with a capacity of one million liters a year," said Matt Bell, the chief executive of Origami. "The goal, really, is to move sake into the mainstream."
If Arkansas seems an odd place to put a sake brewery, the state is by far the leading producer of rice in the United States, growing nearly 40 percent of the national production. As for the other major necessity for sake brewing, Mr. Bell points out that Hot Springs is renowned for the quality of its water.
While sake comes in any number of styles, the basic ingredients are few: rice, water, yeast and koji, a rice mold also used for making miso and soy sauce that breaks down the rice starches into fermentable sugars, just as malting does with grains in beer production.
The variables, however, are many. The freshly harvested form of rice is brown rice, and though brown rice can be used to make sake, that use is rare. The husk and outer part of the grain is usually milled away to expose the starches. The percentage of the grain that is retained after milling, or polishing, will partly determine the style.
Many other factors also play into the final product. Is the water hard or soft? What strain of yeast is used? Where does the rice come from, and where is the brewery? How long should fermentation last? Brewers will sometimes add a small amount of alcohol, which can make a sake more fragrant. Some sakes are infused with citrus or other flavorings. Most sakes are filtered and pasteurized, but other styles exist, too.
Sake produced in the United States accounts for a small fraction of the sake sold domestically. Most is imported from Japan, and wine importers have gotten in on the act. In New York City, Zev Rovine Selections, a natural wine specialist, and Skurnik Wines, a national importer and distributor, have added sake to their portfolios. The upward trajectory of sake sales has been mirrored at Skurnik, said Jamie Graves, who manages its Japanese beverage lineup.
The jump in the last few years has been particularly noticeable in retail, as you might expect, given the restaurant shutdowns during the pandemic.
"Retail sake exploded in 2020 and never went away," Mr. Graves said. "It went from 15 to 20 percent of our sake sales to 40 percent, staying steady even after restaurants reopened."
At Sakaya, a retailer that opened in the East Village in 2007, sake sales took a huge jump during the pandemic, said Rick Smith, who owns the business with his wife, Hiroko Furukawa.
"Interest in sake has increased," he said. "You can see it in more importers and the proliferation, at least in New York City, of all these sushi omakase restaurants."
When Yoko Kumano and Kayoko Akabori opened Umami Mart in Oakland, Calif., in 2012, specializing in Japanese goods and ingredients, they did not sell sake. But they got a license in 2014, and now, Ms. Kumano said, sake is their No. 1 seller.
She has also seen an evolution in her clientele. In 2014, customers would ask for a dry sake and maybe for a daiginjo, a common style.
"Now, people are waking up to the fact that sake is much more versatile than people thought," she said. "They are trying sake with foods other than sushi, and now, they are asking for nama -- unpasteurized sake -- or nigori -- unfiltered sake."
If any individual could take credit for the rising interest in sake in New York, it might be Tadao Yoshida, the entrepreneur behind Japan Village, a complex of Japanese food stalls, groceries and other goods in Industry City. He also owns Kuraichi, a sake store at Japan Village.
Mr. Yoshida, who goes by Tony, has for years sought to introduce Americans to the pleasures of Japanese food and beverages. Over the last 50 years, he built and owned a Japanese-oriented food-and-drink empire in the East Village, including the original location of Sunrise Mart Grocery; Village Yokocho, a restaurant; and Angel's Share, a renowned cocktail bar.
All are now gone, and he is putting his efforts into Japan Village. He especially wants people to understand the many shades and subtleties of sake.
"It's sometimes mild, sometimes sweet," he said. "Some are good for eating with steak."
Since Kuraichi opened in 2018, it has offered Saturday afternoon sake tastings to introduce its clients to the many types of sakes.
"We try to ask them, 'What is the difference?' " he said.
Each of Kato Sake Works' four flagship sakes illustrates a different major style. Mr. Kato makes a bold, clean, fruity and lightly sweet but balanced junmai (a term indicating that nothing else has been used in the production beyond the four key ingredients, and that no more than 70 percent of the rice grain remains after milling). He also makes an intense, complex, milky white nigori, which is unfiltered.
His nama, or unpasteurized, sake is fuller and wilder, almost in your face with a lightly raspy texture. Kimoto, made with an old, labor-intensive process for kicking off the fermentation that Mr. Graves of Skurnik likens to sourdough starter, seems fuller and more complex. Though Mr. Kato also makes smaller batches of other styles, these four are the focus.
"I understand the esoteric nature of sake, so I just want to make things simple," he said.
Richard Geoffroy -- who was for 28 years the charismatic face of Dom Pérignon, overseeing the production of the luxury Champagne and traveling the world to promote it -- was so drawn to sake that, in 2019, he left the company to create, with Japanese partners, his own sake. Though impeded by the Covid pandemic, they built their own brewery and made their first sake, IWA, in 2020. It was released in New York and California last year, and, now past the depths of the pandemic, Mr. Geoffroy has resumed his globe-trotting, proselytizing the beauty of sake and IWA.
He hopes to bring IWA to a wine-drinking audience. IWA is terrific, smooth and light in the mouth, with a floral, lightly fruity aroma but savory, too -- fresh and crystalline, with a sense of tension and energy. The only problem? The Dom Pérignon prices. IWA retails for roughly $ 200 a bottle. (Most mainstream bottles will fall into the $ 25-to- $ 50 range.)
What accounts for the rising interest in the United States? Mr. Graves suggests it's fueled by a rapid increase in American tourism. From 2010 to 2019, the number of Americans visiting Japan rose from roughly 900,000 per year to about 2.2 million, according to JTB Tourism Research and Consulting, which tracks tourism in Japan. Many of these travelers return home with heightened interest in Japanese culture, food and sake.
One restaurant that has made sake a focus is Rule of Thirds, a sleek Japanese restaurant in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, that specializes in izakaya fare. It sells roughly three dozen sakes, along with natural wines, cocktails and shochu, a Japanese distilled spirit.
"We now have two local sake breweries in Brooklyn," said George Padilla, an owner. "Having local entry points is really important. People can make personal connections with the product and meet the people behind it."
During the pandemic, the restaurant opened Bin Bin, a sake and natural wine shop around the block.
"Sake is definitely the leading seller," said Sophia Sioris, who manages Bin Bin. "People enter the shop expecting to see sake, and sales are great."
Mr. Kato says he is encouraged that sake will continue to grow in the United States.
"I see more money coming into the industry. The investment is way bigger than what I had seen before," he said. "People are no longer hesitant."

When Yoko Kumano and Kayoko Akabori opened Umami Mart in Oakland, California, in 2012, specializing in Japanese goods and ingredients, they did not sell sake. But they got a license in 2014, and now, Kumano said, sake is their No. 1 seller.
She has also seen an evolution in her clientele. In 2014, customers would ask for a dry sake and maybe for a daiginjo, a common style.
“Now people are waking up to the fact that sake is much more versatile than people thought,” she said. “They are trying sake with foods other than sushi, and now they are asking for nama — unpasteurized sake — or nigori — unfiltered sake.”
If any individual could take credit for the rising interest in sake in New York, it might be Tadao Yoshida, the entrepreneur behind Japan Village, a complex of Japanese food stalls, groceries and other goods in Industry City in Brooklyn. He also owns Kuraichi, a sake store at Japan Village.
Yoshida, who goes by Tony, has for years sought to introduce Americans to the pleasures of Japanese food and beverages. Over the past 50 years, he built and owned a Japanese-oriented food-and-drink empire in Manhattan’s East Village, including the original location of Sunrise Mart Grocery; Village Yokocho, a restaurant; and Angel’s Share, a renowned cocktail bar.
All are now gone, and he is putting his efforts into Japan Village. He especially wants people to understand the many shades and subtleties of sake.
“It’s sometimes mild, sometimes sweet,” he said. “Some are good for eating with steak.”
Since Kuraichi opened in 2018, it has offered Saturday afternoon sake tastings to introduce its clients to the many types of sakes.
“We try to ask them, ‘What is the difference?’” he said.
Each of Kato Sake Works’ four flagship sakes illustrates a different major style. Shinobu Kato makes a bold, clean, fruity and lightly sweet but balanced junmai (a term indicating that nothing else has been used in the production beyond the four key ingredients, and that no more than 70% of the rice grain remains after milling). He also makes an intense, complex, milky white nigori, which is unfiltered.
His nama, or unpasteurized, sake is fuller and wilder, almost in your face with a lightly raspy texture. Kimoto, made with an old, labor-intensive process for kicking off the fermentation that Graves of Skurnik likens to sourdough starter, seems fuller and more complex. Though Kato also makes smaller batches of other styles, these four are the focus.
“I understand the esoteric nature of sake, so I just want to make things simple,” he said.
Richard Geoffroy — who was for 28 years the charismatic face of Dom Pérignon, overseeing the production of the luxury Champagne and traveling the world to promote it — was so drawn to sake that in 2019 he left the company to create, with Japanese partners, his own sake. Though impeded by the pandemic, they built their own brewery and made their first sake, IWA, in 2020. It was released in New York and California last year, and, now past the depths of the pandemic, Geoffroy has resumed his globe-trotting, proselytizing the beauty of sake and IWA.
He hopes to bring IWA to a wine-drinking audience. IWA is terrific, smooth and light in the mouth, with a floral, lightly fruity aroma but savory, too — fresh and crystalline, with a sense of tension and energy. The only problem? The Dom Pérignon prices. IWA retails for roughly $200 a bottle. (Most mainstream bottles will fall into the $25 to $50 range.)
What accounts for the rising interest in the United States? Graves suggests it’s fueled by a rapid increase in American tourism. From 2010 to 2019, the number of Americans visiting Japan rose from roughly 900,000 per year to about 2.2 million, according to JTB Tourism Research and Consulting, which tracks tourism in Japan. Many of these travelers return home with heightened interest in Japanese culture, food and sake.
One restaurant that has made sake a focus is Rule of Thirds, a sleek Japanese restaurant in Brooklyn that specializes in izakaya fare. It sells roughly three dozen sakes, along with natural wines, cocktails and shochu, a Japanese distilled spirit.
“We now have two local sake breweries in Brooklyn,” said George Padilla, an owner. “Having local entry points is really important. People can make personal connections with the product and meet the people behind it.”
During the pandemic, the restaurant opened Bin Bin, a sake and natural wine shop around the block.
“Sake is definitely the leading seller,” said Sophia Sioris, who manages Bin Bin. “People enter the shop expecting to see sake, and sales are great.”
Kato says he is encouraged that sake will continue to grow in the United States.
“I see more money coming into the industry. The investment is way bigger than what I had seen before,” he said. “People are no longer hesitant.”
— Sake Basics
Sake is the fermented product of rice, with its own character, body of knowledge and vocabulary. Here are some sake basics worth knowing.
Types of Sake
Before the rice is fermented, the outer layer is polished away, leaving the grain’s starchy core.
Junmai. Rice is polished until no more than 70% of the grain remains.
Ginjo. No more than 60% remains.
Daiginjo. No more than 50% remains.
All sakes designated junmai contain only rice, water, yeast and koji, a mold that converts starch into fermentable sugars. Some other sakes are made with small amounts of added distilled alcohol, to heighten body and aromatic appeal. If the sake is junmai, however, no alcohol will have been added. Ginjo and daiginjo sakes may also have added alcohol, unless they are labeled junmai ginjo or junmai daiginjo.
Most sakes are pasteurized and filtered. But other styles exist, too.
Nigori. Unfiltered sake.
Nama. Unpasteurized sake.
Kimoto. An older method in which a labor-intensive form of yeast starter is used to begin fermentation.
Honjozo. Sake with a small amount of added distilled alcohol.
How to Serve, Drink and Store Sake
Serving
Small ceramic or glass cups are traditional, but modest wine glasses work well, as do tumblers.
Storage
Before and after opening, sake should be kept cool and out of the light. Refrigerators are fine. Once opened, bottles can last from a few days to a few weeks.
Temperature
Sake is great served cool, but it can also be delicious gently warmed, depending on the season, mood and type of sake. Yoko Kumano of Umami Mart in Oakland, California, recommends yakitori with warm sake. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

DeSantis Takes Over Zone
Of Disney as Punishment
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday signed a bill that gives him control of Walt Disney World's self-governing district, punishing the company over its opposition to the so-called "Don't Say Gay" law.
The bill requires Mr. DeSantis, a Republican, to appoint a five-member board to oversee the government services that the Disney district provides in its sprawling theme park properties in Florida.
"Today the corporate kingdom finally comes to an end," he said at a bill signing ceremony in Lake Buena Vista. "There's a new sheriff in town, and accountability will be the order of the day."
The signing came as Mr. DeSantis gears up for an expected presidential run and marks a high-profile legislative victory for a governor whose leveraging of cultural and political divides has elevated him in Republican politics.

Nissan Accelerates Shift To Electric Vehicles
Nissan is speeding up its shift toward electric vehicles, especially in Europe where emissions regulations are most stringent, the company said Monday.
Nissan said in a statement that it will make practically all its offerings in Europe electric or series-hybrids by fiscal 2026, at 98 percent. That's up from the previous target of 75 percent. In Japan, the company aims to make 58 percent of its model offerings, up from an earlier target of 55 percent.
Hybrids have both a gasoline engine and electric motor, but a series hybrid uses the motor to power the vehicle's wheels, or powertrain. The engine powers a generator for the motor. Parallel hybrids, like Toyota's Prius, switch back and forth between a gas engine and electric motor.
Nissan's sales target in E.V.s and series hybrids remain unchanged for the U.S., at more than 40 percent. In China the target was cut to 35 percent from 40 percent. That includes only pure E.V.s, not hybrids.

E.U. Official Defends Talks On Funding Tech Upgrades
Europe's existing telecom networks aren't up to the job of handling surging amounts of internet data traffic, a top E.U. official said Monday, as he defended a consultation on whether Big Tech should help pay for upgrades.
The telecom industry needs to reconsider its business models as it undergoes a "radical shift" fueled by a new wave of innovation such as immersive, data-hungry technologies like the metaverse, Thierry Breton, the European Commission's official in charge of digital policy, said at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.
Mr. Breton's remarks came days after he announced a consultation on whether digital giants should help contribute to the billions needed to build the 27-nation bloc's future communications infrastructure, including next-generation 5G wireless.
"Yes, of course, we will need to find a financing model for the huge investments needed," Mr. Breton said. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Full text: Residents encountered more fallout on Saturday after heavy rains and wind caused damage at lower elevations overnight.
LOS ANGELES -- As steady snowfall continued to present hazards in the mountains of Southern California on Saturday, residents at lower elevations dealt with the fallout from a more familiar threat: flooding.
Intense rains and powerful winds that pounded Los Angeles and surrounding counties on Friday night and early Saturday produced significant flooding in urban areas, downed trees and threatened to cause mudslides.
Multiple water rescues were conducted across counties because of rising waters, said Ariel Cohen, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Los Angeles. One person in Santa Barbara County, which also experienced some flooding, was injured after strong winds caused a tree to fall into a home, and in Inglewood, falling trees crushed a line of cars, taking out power lines, he said.
One person died after a vehicle drove off the road and into a flood control area, though it was not immediately clear whether the death was related to the storm, said Kerjon Lee of Los Angeles County Public Works.
Meteorologists said that the most severe effects of the storm at lower elevations could be over, but travel on the roads remained dangerous. Estefany Gomez of Los Angeles was driving through snow in the Sierra Pelona Mountains in Los Angeles County when she lost control of her Nissan Altima while going downhill. She was driving in snow for the first time and, trying to brake, skidded off the road and into a small pond of near-freezing water. Her family members traveling in another vehicle rushed to pull her out.
No one was injured, but Ms. Gomez was rattled. "I'm still shaky and nervous," she said by phone.
Elsewhere, portions of Interstate 5 winding through Los Angeles County -- including the Grapevine, a 40-mile stretch that goes up to Kern County -- were closed on Saturday because of flooding, snow and mudslides. And a 20-mile segment of State Route 14 in Acton, an unincorporated area in northern Los Angeles County, was closed for much of Saturday, snarling southbound traffic for miles. It reopened by midafternoon.
It is rare for the stretch of freeway, lying around 2,000 feet above sea level, to close because of weather conditions, said Eric Menjivar, a spokesman for Caltrans, California's Department of Transportation, referring to State Route 14. Working 12-hour shifts, 24 hours a day, work crews had plowed more than 200 miles of freeway lanes on Saturday. The elevations where snow fell "really dropped" on Friday night, he said.
"We're having a lot of flooding," Mr. Menjivar said. "It's a slow-moving storm and the rain has been really consistent." He added later that the snow "has been really relentless." On Saturday afternoon in Los Angeles, the rain, which had stopped in the late morning, grew heavy again. The weather left some residents scrambling to change their weekend plans for outdoor events, typically a sure thing this time of year in Los Angeles. The season-opening match on Saturday between Major League Soccer crosstown rivals L.A. Galaxy and LAFC in Pasadena was postponed because of forecasts that included potential lightning.
Six Flags Magic Mountain in Los Angeles County and Knott's Berry Farm in Orange County were closed, and Little League opening day parades were canceled because of wind and rain.
"It's been a big disappointment," said Tracey Lee, 48, a resident of the coastal community of Palos Verdes Estates near Los Angeles, who had spent three months planning opening day celebrations for the local Little League.
The festivities included a two-mile parade of double-decker buses, trolley cars and floats on trailers led by police and fire vehicles down one of the small city's main thoroughfares. About 2,000 people were expected to be at the event as participants or spectators.
"We don't have another choice," she said, lamenting the cancellation. "They say you live in this area for two reasons: Halloween and opening day. It's something the whole community looks forward to every year."
Along with the disappointment, Ms. Lee said her neighborhood also experienced power outages during the week and downed trees.
The storm has already set records. On Friday, Los Angeles International Airport received a record 2.04 inches of rain. Earlier in the week, Los Angeles County issued its first blizzard warning since Feb. 4, 1989.
"It's been many years since we've had such a widespread coincidence of all of these hazards at the same time," Mr. Cohen said.
The United States and other countries have already seen more frequent extreme rainstorms as the world warms. The frequency is likely to increase as warming continues, in part because warmer air holds more moisture.
Almost 15 inches of rain have fallen in parts of Los Angeles County over the past four days, the Weather Service estimated.
In the mountains around Los Angeles, winter storm warnings remained in effect. More than four feet of snow had accumulated by Saturday morning, and the total could double by the end of the day, with whiteout conditions on roads.
In Northern California, which felt the impact of this storm earlier in the week, residents are facing another dose of wintry weather early next week. Yosemite National Park announced that it would be closed through Wednesday because of rain, wind and snow that were forecast.
In Southern California, scattered showers with possible hail or graupel were expected to continue into the night, with most storms lightening up around Sunday morning. Sunday is expected to remain clear before another storm system moves in on Monday, according to the Weather Service.
In the mountains, the Weather Service forecast moderate snowfall of up to three inches more continuing into Sunday afternoon, keeping many mountain roadways impassable, as well as strong winds that could take down more trees.
Despite all the disruptions and inconveniences, some residents were not fazed.
"I love when all this stuff happens. I love all the rain we have been getting this year," said John Carter, who was with his wife, Christina, at a Panera Bread in Corona, a town about 50 miles southeast of Los Angeles.
Mr. Carter, 46, a 911 dispatch operator for the Anaheim Police Department, said he loves the change and that he and his wife were looking forward to the spring poppies bloom, which was already happening in the hills along the highway near their home in unincorporated Riverside County.
Ms. Carter, 47, who works in administration with Southern California Edison, said the rain made all the foothills around them green, "and you get to see something different than your everyday dusty brown."

Full text: He pushed the company into North America and beyond, setting it on its path to becoming one of the world's most powerful automakers.
TOKYO -- Shoichiro Toyoda, the chief of the automotive giant Toyota, who led the company as it expanded production into North America in the 1980s and helped transform it into a global brand, died on Tuesday. The son of the company's founder, he was 97.
Toyota said in a statement that the cause was heart failure. It did not say where he had died.
In a decade at Toyota's helm, Mr. Toyoda marshaled his considerable skills in engineering, management, politics and diplomacy to put the company on the path to passing General Motors as the world's largest automaker.
The accomplishment was all the more impressive because he took charge of Toyota at the height of U.S.-Japan trade tensions, in 1982, when Japanese cars had become a powerful symbol of American fears of a rising Japan replacing the United States as the world's largest economic power.
Despite those tensions, Mr. Toyoda expanded his company's production into North America, first forming an alliance with General Motors in 1984 before opening the company's first American plant, in Kentucky, in 1988, yielding to American pressure to produce cars in the United States.
By the end of his tenure, he had expanded production globally, making the company truly international.
Mr. Toyoda took a pragmatic approach to relations between the United States and Japan -- then the world's first and second largest economies -- arguing that as Japan rose, it needed to work harder to ingratiate itself with its competitors, a message that he made part of Toyota's corporate philosophy.
After stepping down as Toyota's chief executive, in 1994, he became the head of Japan's most powerful business lobby, where he helped shape the country's efforts to fight the economic stagnation that began in the early 1990s.
Shoichiro Toyoda was born on Feb. 27, 1925, in Nagoya, an industrial port city in central Japan, the second of four children of Kiichiro and Hatako Toyoda. He enjoyed a privileged childhood: In a 2014 column for the newspaper Nikkei Shimbun, he recounted how his elementary school classmates had teased him when he revealed that he breakfasted with his family's "maidservant."
His father founded Toyota Motor in 1937, spinning it off from an automatic loom manufacturer started by his father, Sakichi. The "d" in Toyoda was changed to a "t" in the company name because it was thought that it looked better when written in Japanese.
During World War II, Mr. Toyoda began studies at Nagoya University. He was passed over for the military draft because his major, engineering, was considered vital for the war effort, he wrote in the Nikkei article. When the war ended, he enrolled in a graduate program in Tohoku University and later received a doctorate from Nagoya University.
In 1950, a debt-racked Toyota split into two companies, one for manufacturing, which Kiichiro Toyoda ran, and the other for sales. Faced with a festering labor dispute, Kiichiro Toyoda was forced to resign, temporarily ending the family's leadership of the company. He died soon after.
Shoichiro Toyoda joined the company at 27 as director of the inspection department. Early in his career he played a key role in Toyota's first foray into the United States, signing off in 1957 on the export of the company's Crown model after taking it on an American road trip, which included a cheeky stop in front of Ford's headquarters in Detroit.
But American drivers rejected the car, complaining of its weak engine. The failure made Mr. Toyoda "determined to develop a high-quality passenger car that would perform well anywhere in the world," he wrote in the Nikkei in 2014.
Despite the flub, he quickly rose in the company's ranks, partly because of his talent for engineering and business and partly because of his family's continued influence over the business. By 1982, when the two halves of the company reunited, he was at the top.
It was a period of both great promise and risk for the company. Japan had surpassed the U.S. as the world's largest automaker, and with inflation, unemployment and protectionist sentiment running high in America, Tokyo and Washington agreed on the first of many rounds of import restrictions on Japanese automobiles.
While Nissan and Honda established American factories, Mr. Toyoda led the company into a deal with General Motors, intended to help the company increase its American sales. In an interview with The New York Times, one company executive said the move was like offering "salt to our enemy," a reference to Japan's feudal period, when warlords would sometimes feed people in enemy territory. Car and Driver magazine ran the headline "Hell Freezes Over." The partnership ended soon after General Motors declared bankruptcy in 2009.
Even as he competed with American companies, Mr. Toyoda pushed for Japanese companies to play a bigger role in the communities where they built their factories. In a 1990 speech, he encouraged Japanese industrialists to "contribute on the same level as Americans" by becoming active in local charitable organizations in the United States. (The Japanese government gave tax breaks to those that did.)
As Americans became enamored of Toyota's ultraefficient production practices, Mr. Toyoda started a management training center to help U.S. businesses. And he helped keep trade tensions down through concessions to Washington.
By 1992, when he stepped down as president to become the company's chairman, Toyota had plants in 22 countries and was competing with its former partner, General Motors, for the title of the world's largest automaker. It won that battle in 2008.
In 1994, as Japan's meteoric economic rise suddenly turned into a period of stagnation, Mr. Toyoda was appointed head of the business lobbying group Keidanren, where he spent four years pushing the country to reduce the many regulations that he believed hindered its growth.
He stepped down as Toyota's chairman in 1999 and became honorary chairman for life, a position from which he continued to influence the company's course. He was inducted into the U.S. Automotive Hall of Fame in 2007.
He is survived by his wife, Hiroko, whom he married in 1952; a son, Akio; and a daughter, Atsuko.
Reflecting on his career in the 2014 article, Mr. Toyoda wrote, "I have worked single-mindedly to add at least a few new lines to the auto industry history books."

Tesla Workers at a Factory in Buffalo Begin a Campaign to Form a Union: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: If successful, the workers who help develop Tesla's Autopilot driver-assistance system will be the first group at the company to organize.
A group of workers at a Tesla factory in Buffalo began a campaign on Tuesday to form a union, saying they want better pay and benefits. If successful, the effort could establish the first union at the fast-growing auto and energy company, which has fiercely resisted efforts to organize its employees.
The factory in Buffalo makes solar panels and components for charging equipment, according to Tesla's website, and also has about 800 workers who help develop driver-assistance software for cars. The software workers initiated the union drive, and went public Tuesday in an effort to win broader support at the site.
Tesla pays workers in Buffalo less than national averages and they receive little sick time, workers involved in the drive said. "We are only asking for a seat in the car that we helped build," Keenan Lasch, a member of a group calling itself Tesla Workers United, said in a statement.
The employees are working with Workers United, which is affiliated with the Service Employees International Union. The union campaign was reported earlier by Bloomberg News.
Attempts to organize Tesla workers have so far failed. Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, has been openly hostile to unions. In 2021, the National Labor Relations Board found that Tesla had illegally fired a worker involved in organizing at the company's car factory in Fremont, Calif., and that Mr. Musk had illegally threatened workers with the loss of stock options if they unionized.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
The company's nonunion workplaces potentially give the company a cost advantage over established automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, whose employees are represented by the United Auto Workers in the United States. Unionized workers generally receive better pay and benefits than workers who are not represented.
The U.A.W. has so far been frustrated in its attempts to expand beyond the Michigan automakers. In recent years, attempts to organize workers for foreign automakers with factories in the South, including Nissan, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and Toyota, have failed.
Tesla is the latest big technology company to be the target of labor organizers. Amazon workers at a warehouse on Staten Island voted in April to unionize, but workers at an Amazon facility in Albany, N.Y., voted in October against union representation.
The drive in Buffalo has the support of Jaz Brisack, who gained national prominence for her efforts to organize Starbucks workers in Buffalo.
"So incredibly glad to be working with the Tesla workers on their campaign!" Ms. Brisack said on Twitter on Tuesday.
The Autopilot workers in Buffalo analyze data collected by cars to improve the software, which has been blamed for numerous crashes, some fatal. Federal officials have asked Tesla for documents related to the self-driving software, the company disclosed last month.
Tesla has openings for jobs in Buffalo that entail labeling images and videos collected from cars. No experience in artificial intelligence or data labeling is required, according to two job postings on its website.
Workers said they were committed to Tesla's mission but wanted a greater voice. In an open letter to fellow workers, they said they wanted to form a union that would "be as innovative as the company we work for and to build an even more collaborative environment that will strengthen the company."
"As much as I love my job, it can feel very disheartening living paycheck to paycheck when I work for one of the most successful companies in the world," Zahra Lahrache, who has worked at Tesla in Buffalo for five months, said in a statement issued by the workers, "and that is why I am exercising my right to unionize."

Electric Vehicle Prices Are Closing In on Gas Cars: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Competition, government incentives and falling raw material prices are making battery-powered cars more affordable sooner than expected.
More quickly than seemed possible a few months ago, sticker prices for electric vehicles are falling closer to the point where they could soon be on a par with gasoline cars.
Increased competition, government incentives and falling prices for lithium and other battery materials are making electric vehicles noticeably more affordable. The tipping point when electric vehicles become as cheap as or cheaper than cars with internal combustion engines could arrive this year for some mass market models and is already the case for some luxury vehicles.
Prices are likely to continue trending lower as Tesla, General Motors, Ford Motor and their battery suppliers ramp up new factories, reaping the cost savings that come from mass production. New electric vehicles from companies like Volkswagen, Nissan and Hyundai will add to competitive pressure.
The battery-powered version of G.M.'s Equinox crossover, for example, will start around $ 30,000 when it arrives this fall, the carmaker has said. That is $ 3,400 more than the least expensive gasoline-fueled Equinox. But factoring in government incentives, the electric Equinox should be cheaper. Like all electric vehicles, the car will need less maintenance, and the electricity to power it will cost less than the gasoline used by its combustion engine equivalent.
Only a few months ago, electric vehicle buyers faced long waiting lists, and dealers marked up sticker prices by thousands of dollars. Used electric vehicles sometimes sold for more than new ones because buyers were willing to pay a premium to get one right away. At the end of 2022, the average price of an electric vehicle was $ 61,488, compared with $ 49,507 for all passenger cars and trucks, according to Kelley Blue Book.
There are still waiting lists for some models like the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck, but it has become easier and cheaper to find and buy new and used electric models.
The first major crack in the trend of rising prices came in January when Tesla cut prices for the Model 3 and Model Y, the two best-selling electric cars, by thousands of dollars. With a starting price of $ 43,500 before government incentives, a Model 3 is now $ 300 less than the least expensive BMW 3 Series sedan. A Model Y, at $ 55,000 before tax credits, costs about as much as a comparable Lexus RX.
Ford also cut the price of its Mustang Mach-E, the best-selling electric vehicle in the United States after the Teslas. Even Lucid Motors, a maker of expensive electric sedans that do not qualify for tax credits, is feeling pressure to cut prices and this week began offering $ 7,500 discounts on cars that start at $ 107,400.
Tesla "saw there is increasing competition and some of the competition is quite good," said Brian Moody, executive editor for Kelley Blue Book. He added, "If the No. 1 seller of a certain type of car reduces their prices, that is going to have an impact on the average."
Major impetus for the price cuts came from the Inflation Reduction Act, legislation passed by Democrats in Congress last year that provides tax credits of up to $ 7,500 for electric car buyers. To qualify, battery-powered or plug-in hybrid sedans have to sell for less than $ 55,000, while pickups and sport utility vehicles qualify only if the retail price is below $ 80,000. By cutting prices, Ford and Tesla increased the number of models that could benefit from the tax credits.
Manufacturers "are working to continue to pull in shoppers by making these vehicles eligible for tax credits," said Jenni Newman, editor in chief of Cars.com, an online auto sales site.
Potentially more significant are subsidies paid to companies that manufacture batteries in the United States, part of a drive by the Biden administration to establish a domestic supply chain and reduce dependence on China.
The subsidies, which were also part of the Inflation Reduction Act, could cut the cost of making electric vehicles by as much as $ 9,000. That break and the tax credits for buyers of electric cars could allow battery-powered vehicles to achieve price parity with gasoline cars as soon as this year, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research and advocacy group. That is three to five years sooner than would be the case without incentives.
"If the automakers pass that on to consumers, consumers will really benefit," said Stephanie Searle, a program director at the council who oversees research on passenger vehicles.
Declines in new car prices are pushing down used electric vehicle prices, too. They have fallen 17 percent since July, according to Recurrent, which tracks the used car market. That's largely because Tesla cut the price of the Model 3 and G.M. lowered the price of the Chevrolet Bolt by almost $ 6,000 last year. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, used cars can also qualify for a tax credit of up to $ 4,000. That is important because most people buy used vehicles.
Falling prices for materials like lithium and cobalt have also helped. The price of lithium used in batteries has fallen 20 percent from its peak in November, though the metal still costs more than twice as much as it did at the end of 2021. Cobalt has fallen by more than half since May, in part because carmakers are selling some models that do not require it, reducing demand.
New lithium mines are beginning to produce ore, which could keep a lid on prices. Sigma Lithium will begin shipping raw material from a site in Brazil to LG Energy Solution, its main customer, as early as April, Ana Cabral Gardner, Sigma Lithium's chief executive, said in an interview. The site will be the first new source of lithium in Latin America for several years.
"It's doable, and we're there," Ms. Cabral Gardner said.
Of course, these advantages could fade because of new supply chain problems. Lithium remains in short supply, and prices could spike again. Beginning next month, new regulations governing the $ 7,500 tax credits will require electric car batteries to be made in the United States, Canada or Mexico with raw materials from North America or another U.S. trade ally. It is unclear how many vehicles will meet those requirements.
Right now, the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits are available to vehicles assembled in North America, which partly shields the U.S. automakers from competitors like Hyundai. The company's Ioniq 5 has sold well, but it is imported from South Korea. Hyundai is building a factory in Georgia that will start assembling electric vehicles in 2025. (Buyers may still collect a tax credit indirectly if they lease foreign-made electric vehicles.)
The Treasury Department, which is responsible for carrying out the Inflation Reduction Act, gave in to auto industry lobbying this month and classified several popular crossovers as S.U.V.s rather than sedans. That allows vehicles like the Mustang Mach-E and all versions of the Model Y to qualify for tax credits if they sell for $ 80,000 or less. Before that change, the Mustang and lighter versions of the Model Y were classified as sedans, subject to the $ 55,000 limit.
The decision removes some pressure on the carmakers to keep prices low. Tesla quickly raised the price of the Model Y by $ 2,000. Ford said it had no plans to raise prices of the Mach-E.
The Inflation Reduction Act is also under attack by many congressional Republicans even though automakers and battery companies are building factories in states, like South Carolina, Texas and Tennessee, where voters tend to elect Republicans.
But arguably the most powerful force driving down prices is not the commodity markets or Washington.
As electric vehicle sales soar -- rising 66 percent in the United States last year to 810,000, according to Kelley Blue Book -- automakers are getting better at making them. Ford has reduced the weight of the Mach-E by 70 pounds, increasing range and lowering cost, by eliminating some wiring, Jim Farley, the company's chief executive, told investors this month.
General Motors and LG Energy Solution began producing batteries at a new plant in Ohio last year through a joint venture, Ultium Cells. A second Ultium plant, in Tennessee, is expected to begin production this year, and a third is slated for Michigan. Generally speaking, costs come down as companies produce more of a product.
Auto executives say they are finding it is easier and cheaper to design and build new electric models than gasoline-powered ones.
The battery cells made by Ultium, for example, are part of a collection of components that can be mixed and matched in many types of vehicles. Carmakers have long used the same platforms in multiple models, but the strategy works even better with electric vehicles because the cars have far fewer parts than internal combustion vehicles.
The Ultium platform cuts the time needed to develop a new vehicle by almost two years, Dan Nicholson, vice president of electrification at G.M., said at a Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago conference in January.
As a result, G.M. will be able to introduce three Chevrolet electric vehicles this year: the Equinox, a Silverado pickup truck and a Blazer S.U.V. "That's how we get the economies of scale," Mr. Nicholson said.
Suppliers have been looking for efficiencies, too. Matthews International, based in Pittsburgh, has developed a process for coating the metal foil that separates the positive and negative electrodes of a battery. Instead of a liquid solution, the process uses a powder.
The process requires less equipment and a lot less space, said Greg Babe, the company's chief technology officer. Those kinds of incremental improvements reduce costs without major technical breakthroughs.
Interest in the approach developed by Matthews has soared since President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act. "It changed almost overnight," Mr. Babe said. "The floodgates opened."

The company’s Ioniq 5 has sold well, but it is imported from South Korea. Hyundai is building a factory in Georgia that will start assembling electric vehicles in 2025. (Buyers may still collect a tax credit indirectly if they lease foreign-made electric vehicles.)
The Treasury Department, which is responsible for carrying out the Inflation Reduction Act, gave in to auto industry lobbying this month and classified several popular crossovers as SUVs rather than sedans. That allows vehicles like the Mustang Mach-E and all versions of the Model Y to qualify for tax credits if they sell for $80,000 or less. Before that change, the Mustang and lighter versions of the Model Y were classified as sedans, subject to a $55,000 limit.
The decision removes some pressure on the carmakers to keep prices low. Tesla quickly raised the price of the Model Y by $2,000. Ford said it had no plans to raise prices of the Mach-E.
The Inflation Reduction Act is also under attack by many congressional Republicans even though automakers and battery companies are building factories in states like South Carolina, Texas and Tennessee, where voters tend to elect Republicans.
But arguably the most powerful force driving down prices is not the commodity markets or Washington.
As electric-vehicle sales soar — rising 66% in the United States last year to 810,000, according to Kelley Blue Book — automakers are getting better at making them. Ford has reduced the weight of the Mach-E by 70 pounds, increasing range and lowering cost, by eliminating some wiring, Jim Farley, the company’s chief executive, told investors this month.
GM and LG Energy Solution began producing batteries at a new plant in Ohio last year through a joint venture, Ultium Cells. A second Ultium plant, in Tennessee, is expected to begin production this year, and a third is slated for Michigan. Generally speaking, costs come down as companies produce more of a product.
Auto executives say that they are finding it is easier and cheaper to design and build new electric models than gasoline-powered ones.
The battery cells made by Ultium, for example, are part of a collection of components that can be mixed and matched in many types of vehicles. Carmakers have long used the same platforms in multiple models, but the strategy works even better with electric vehicles because the cars have far fewer parts than internal combustion vehicles.
The Ultium platform cuts the time needed to develop a new vehicle by almost two years, Dan Nicholson, vice president of electrification at GM, said at a Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago conference in January.
As a result, GM will be able to introduce three Chevrolet electric vehicles this year: the Equinox, a Silverado pickup truck and a Blazer SUV. “That’s how we get the economies of scale,” Nicholson said.
Suppliers have been looking for efficiencies, too. Matthews International, based in Pittsburgh, has developed a process for coating the metal foil that separates the positive and negative electrodes of a battery. Instead of a liquid solution, the process uses a powder.
The process requires less equipment and a lot less space, said Greg Babe, the company’s chief technology officer. Those kinds of incremental improvements reduce costs without major technical breakthroughs.
Interest in the approach developed by Matthews has soared since Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act. “It changed almost overnight,” Babe said. “The floodgates opened.”

More quickly than seemed possible a few months ago, sticker prices for electric vehicles are falling closer to the point at which they could soon be on a par with gasoline cars.
Increased competition, government incentives and falling prices for lithium and other battery materials are making electric vehicles noticeably more affordable. The tipping point when electric vehicles become as cheap or cheaper than cars with internal combustion engines could arrive this year for some mass market models and is already the case for some luxury vehicles.
Prices are likely to continue trending lower as Tesla, General Motors, Ford Motor and their battery suppliers ramp up new factories, reaping the cost savings that come from mass production. New electric vehicles from companies like Volkswagen, Nissan and Hyundai will add to competitive pressure.
The battery-powered version of GM’s Equinox crossover, for example, will start around $30,000 when it arrives this fall, the carmaker has said. That is $3,400 more than the least expensive gasoline-fueled Equinox. But factoring in government incentives, the electric Equinox should be cheaper. Like all electric vehicles, the car will need less maintenance, and the electricity to power it will cost less than the gasoline used by its combustion engine equivalent.
Only a few months ago, electric-vehicle buyers faced long waiting lists, and dealers marked up sticker prices by thousands of dollars. Used electric vehicles sometimes sold for more than new ones because buyers were willing to pay a premium to get one right away. At the end of 2022, the average price of an electric vehicle was $61,488, compared with $49,507 for all passenger cars and trucks, according to Kelley Blue Book.
There are still waiting lists for some models like the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck, but it has become easier and cheaper to find and buy new and used electric models.
The first major crack in the trend of rising prices came in January, when Tesla cut prices for the Model 3 and Model Y, the two bestselling electric cars, by thousands of dollars. With a starting price of $43,500 before government incentives, a Model 3 is now $300 less than the least expensive BMW 3 Series sedan. A Model Y, at $55,000 before tax credits, costs about as much as a comparable Lexus RX.
Ford also cut the price of its Mustang Mach-E, the bestselling electric vehicle in the United States after the Teslas. Even Lucid Motors, a maker of expensive electric sedans that do not qualify for tax credits, is feeling pressure to cut prices and this week began offering $7,500 discounts on cars that start at $107,400.
Tesla “saw there is increasing competition, and some of the competition is quite good,” said Brian Moody, executive editor for Kelley Blue Book. He added, “If the No. 1 seller of a certain type of car reduces their prices, that is going to have an impact on the average.”
Major impetus for the price cuts came from the Inflation Reduction Act, legislation passed by Democrats in Congress last year that provides tax credits of up to $7,500 for electric-car buyers. To qualify, battery-powered or plug-in hybrid sedans have to sell for less than $55,000, while pickups and sport utility vehicles qualify only if the retail price is below $80,000. By cutting prices, Ford and Tesla increased the number of models that could benefit from the tax credits.
Manufacturers “are working to continue to pull in shoppers by making these vehicles eligible for tax credits,” said Jenni Newman, editor-in-chief of Cars.com, an online auto-sales site.
Potentially more significant are subsidies paid to companies that manufacture batteries in the United States, part of a drive by the Biden administration to establish a domestic supply chain and reduce dependence on China.
The subsidies, which were also part of the Inflation Reduction Act, could cut the cost of making electric vehicles by as much as $9,000. That break and the tax credits for buyers of electric cars could allow battery-powered vehicles to achieve price parity with gasoline cars as soon as this year, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research and advocacy group. That is three to five years sooner than would be the case without incentives.
“If the automakers pass that on to consumers, consumers will really benefit,” said Stephanie Searle, a program director at the council who oversees research on passenger vehicles.
Declines in new-car prices are pushing down used electric-vehicle prices, too. They have fallen 17% since July, according to Recurrent, which tracks the used-car market. That’s largely because of Tesla cutting the price of the Model 3 and GM lowering the price of the Chevrolet Bolt by almost $6,000 last year. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, used cars can also qualify for a tax credit of up to $4,000. That is important because most people buy used vehicles.
Falling prices for materials like lithium and cobalt have also helped. The price of lithium used in batteries has fallen 20% from its peak in November, though the metal still costs more than twice as much as it did at the end of 2021. Cobalt has fallen by more than half since May, in part because carmakers are selling some models that do not require it, reducing demand.
New lithium mines are beginning to produce ore, which could keep a lid on prices. Sigma Lithium will begin shipping raw material from a site in Brazil to LG Energy Solution, its main customer, as early as April, Ana Cabral Gardner, Sigma Lithium’s chief executive, said in an interview. The site will be the first new source of lithium in Latin America for several years. “It’s doable, and we’re there,” Cabral Gardner said.
Of course, these advantages could fade because of new supply-chain problems. Lithium remains in short supply, and prices could spike again. Beginning next month, new regulations governing the $7,500 tax credits will require electric-car batteries to be made in the United States, Canada or Mexico with raw materials from North America or another U.S. trade ally. It is unclear how many vehicles will meet those requirements.
Right now, the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits are available to vehicles assembled in North America, which partially shields the U.S. automakers from competitors like Hyundai. The company’s Ioniq 5 has sold well, but it is imported from South Korea. Hyundai is building a factory in Georgia that will start assembling electric vehicles in 2025. (Buyers may still collect a tax credit indirectly if they lease foreign-made electric vehicles.)
The Treasury Department, which is responsible for carrying out the Inflation Reduction Act, gave in to auto industry lobbying this month and classified several popular crossovers as SUVs rather than sedans.

The decision removes some pressure on the carmakers to keep prices low. Tesla quickly raised the price of the Model Y by $2,000. Ford said it has no plans to raise prices of the Mach-E.
The Inflation Reduction Act is also under attack by many congressional Republicans even though automakers and battery companies are building factories in states like South Carolina, Texas and Tennessee, where voters tend to elect Republicans.
But arguably the most powerful force driving down prices is not the commodity markets or Washington.
As electric-vehicle sales soar — rising 66% in the United States last year to 810,000, according to Kelley Blue Book — automakers are getting better at making them.

Nissan and Renault Rebalance Power in Race for E.V.s: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The automakers said they would resolve a yearslong dispute that became the backdrop to Carlos Ghosn's downfall as head of the alliance.
Two giant automakers tied in an uneasy alliance -- Japan's Nissan and France's Renault -- announced on Monday that they had struck a deal to make their relationship more equitable, ending a yearslong power struggle that contributed to the downfall of the alliance's former leader, Carlos Ghosn.
The agreement opens a path for the companies to increase cooperation in the growing market for electric vehicles, a critical area for the alliance as it seeks to respond to changing regulations and the challenges posed by upstart competitors like Tesla and China's BYD, which have vaulted past traditional automakers in the race to meet consumer demand for battery-powered cars.
Nissan said that the agreement was "an important milestone in its discussions with Renault Group on defining new foundations for their partnership," which has been dominated by the French automaker since 1999, when it bailed out the foundering Japanese company.
Renault eventually built up a 43 percent stake in Nissan with voting rights on its board, while Nissan held only a 15 percent stake in Renault and no voting rights.
The arrangement has long been a sore spot for Nissan, which produces far more cars than Renault and argued it deserved to have a more equivalent role in the relationship.
The agreement, Nissan said, would effectively equalize the companies' shareholdings. Both would now hold 15 percent of the other, with Renault's additional shares going into a French trust. The trust would be under no obligation to sell them, it said.
The companies will now also have equal voting rights, Nissan said.
Additionally, Nissan agreed to invest in Ampere, a Renault spinoff focused on developing electric vehicles and software. The company is expected to be publicly listed later this year.
The final agreement is pending approval by both companies' boards.
The agreement is critical for the electric-vehicle ambitions of Renault, which is seeking to harness the engineering prowess and expertise of Nissan. In 2010 the Japanese automaker began producing the world's first successful mass-market battery-electric vehicle, the Leaf, giving it a lead in the field that Renault cannot match.
The power imbalance between Renault and Nissan was widely seen as a catalyst for the downfall of Mr. Ghosn, who has said that he was the victim of a coup by Nissan insiders who feared he would merge the two companies. Mr. Ghosn fled Japan for Lebanon in late 2019 after being arrested on charges of financial wrongdoing related to his role as head of the alliance.
For a time, the incident looked like it could end the alliance. But the economic blow of the pandemic forced the companies to draw closer together.
Last year, Renault and Nissan, along with their third alliance partner, Mitsubishi, agreed to throw themselves into the development of electric vehicles, with plans to release 35 battery-electric models by 2030.
But Nissan was slow to agree to invest in Ampere. After media reports last fall revealed that Nissan and Renault were at loggerheads over the project, Renault released a statement saying that the two sides were discussing "a set of strategic common initiatives across markets, products, and technologies," including Nissan's role in the new company.
On Monday, Renault called the deal with Nissan "an important milestone in its discussions on defining new foundations for their partnership."

Direct Route Flooded, Driver Embarks on a 3,000-Mile Detour: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Few roads crisscross Western Australia, so when a single one is closed, there can be serious complications. Ask Chris English.
MELBOURNE, Australia -- There are just three routes between Kununurra, a small town in Western Australia, and the larger city of Broome.
The first, and most direct, curves over 600 miles of scrubby road. The second is a gravel track that barely features in online maps.
Chris English, who needed to get the family S.U.V. from Broome to Kununurra, weighed his options and chose the third: a 3,000-mile detour in the other direction, looping around a substantial part of Australia. An American equivalent would be driving from Montana to Idaho by way of both Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, Utah, Arizona and Nevada.
"I'm a seasoned driver," Mr. English, 64, said from Alice Springs on Thursday, four days into his trip. "As far as traveling through the center of Australia, off the beaten track and whatnot, goes, I've been doing it all my life. So to me personally, it's just another trek."
Mr. English's hand was forced by some of the worst flooding in the history of Western Australia.
He and his wife, who live in Kununurra, a town of 5,500 people, had gone to Perth for the Christmas holidays, to spend a few weeks with their children and grandchildren. That involved driving to Broome, leaving their S.U.V. there and boarding a plane.
While they were in Perth, disaster struck. "Cyclone Ellie decided to come in behind us and dump 400-odd millimeters of rain in a very short period of time," he said.
The record-setting rainfall caused rivers to burst their banks, creating an inland sea 30 miles wide. In images from the aftermath, puzzled-looking kangaroos can be seen wading through the muddy floodwaters, which lingered for weeks. Airstrips -- relied on for food deliveries in many outback towns -- were inundated, and homes were evacuated.
And the Englishes had a problem of their own: how to get the S.U.V. home from Broome.
Western Australia is the country's biggest and most sparsely populated state, its 2.7 million people spread over an area the size of Argentina. Few roads crisscross the territory, so closing just one can cause major complications.
The flooding had washed out a stretch of the Great Northern Highway, Australia's longest, and cut off a major bridge, Mr. English said. That would have been the most direct Broome-to-Kununurra route.
The second route, via a gravel track known as the Gibb River Road, was also impassable, he said.
"During the wet season, there's no way you're going to get across," said Mr. English, who drives a school bus. "Which I know. So I go, OK, the only other way is" -- he paused -- "the way I've come."
And so on Monday, after flying from Perth to Broome, Mr. English set out: one man, a white Nissan Patrol and the vastness of the Australian outback.
Before long, unbeknown to him, thousands were watching. Mr. English's son Craig posted a screenshot of his mind-boggling route on Twitter, and began to share photos and other updates his father had sent from the road.
"I got a phone call from one of the kids, or my wife, saying 'You're famous!"' Mr. English said. "I said, 'What do you mean?"'
People around the world followed along as Mr. English wound his way through central Australia, at the lawful speed of 60 miles an hour, with no soundtrack but the drone of the engine. (He left the radio off; for much of the trip there would have been no signal in range anyway.) He spent his nights at motels or by the roadside, in a sleeping bag atop the S.U.V.
He sped past cotton trucks, car accidents and the desert countryside. He stopped to photograph greenery, unexpectedly lush after the rain; a quintet of roadside feral camels; and Uluru, the vast sandstone monolith once known as Ayers Rock, which many Australians consider the country's spiritual heart.
"I've always wanted to see it raining on the rock, to see the water cascading over it," Mr. English said. "That's a bucket list thing."
As he approached the rock, he said, there was rainfall -- but not on Uluru. "It was raining on one side of the rock, it was raining on the other side of the rock, but not on the rock," he said.
By Friday evening, Mr. English had stopped for the night, because of more flooding on the roads. He was just a few hours from home, where he said a couple of beers awaited him. His wife had been back for days -- she'd simply flown home from Perth. (Driving to Broome had never been strictly necessary, but it meant they could book a cheaper flight.)
Mr. English had logged more miles than the distance from Moscow to Gibraltar. But he didn't consider it remarkable. "Driving doesn't bother me," he said. "It's just something I like to do."

English’s hand was forced by some of the worst flooding in the history of Western Australia.
He and his wife, who live in Kununurra, a town of 5,500 people, had gone to Perth for the Christmas holidays, to spend a few weeks with their children and grandchildren. That involved driving to Broome, leaving their SUV there and boarding a plane.
While they were in Perth, disaster struck. “Cyclone Ellie decided to come in behind us and dump 400-odd millimeters [almost 16 inches] of rain in a very short period of time,” he said.
The record-setting rainfall caused rivers to burst their banks, creating an inland sea 30 miles wide. In images from the aftermath, puzzled-looking kangaroos can be seen wading through the muddy floodwaters, which lingered for weeks. Airstrips — relied on for food deliveries in many outback towns — were inundated, and homes were evacuated.
And the Englishes had a problem of their own: how to get the SUV home from Broome.
Western Australia is the country’s biggest and most sparsely populated state, its 2.7 million people spread over an area the size of Argentina. Few roads crisscross the territory, so closing just one can cause major complications.
The flooding had washed out a stretch of the Great Northern Highway, Australia’s longest, and cut off a major bridge, English said. That would have been the most direct Broome-to-Kununurra route.
The second route, via a gravel track known as the Gibb River Road, was also impassable, he said.
“During the wet season, there’s no way you’re going to get across,” said English, who drives a school bus. “Which I know. So I go, OK, the only other way is” — he paused — “the way I’ve come.”
And so Monday, after flying from Perth to Broome, English set out: one man, a white Nissan Patrol and the vastness of the Australian outback.
Before long, unbeknown to him, thousands were watching. English’s son Craig posted a screenshot of his mind-boggling route on Twitter, and began to share photos and other updates his father had sent from the road.
“I got a phone call from one of the kids, or my wife, saying ‘You’re famous!’” English said. “I said, ‘What do you mean?’”
People around the world followed along as English wound his way through central Australia, at the lawful speed of 60 mph, with no soundtrack but the drone of the engine. (He left the radio off; for much of the trip there would have been no signal in range anyway.) He spent his nights at motels or by the roadside, in a sleeping bag atop the SUV.
He sped past cotton trucks, car accidents and the desert countryside. He stopped to photograph greenery, unexpectedly lush after the rain; a quintet of roadside feral camels; and Uluru, the vast sandstone monolith once known as Ayers Rock, which many Australians consider the country’s spiritual heart.
“I’ve always wanted to see it raining on the rock, to see the water cascading over it,” English said. “That’s a bucket list thing.”
As he approached the rock, he said, there was rainfall — but not on Uluru. “It was raining on one side of the rock, it was raining on the other side of the rock, but not on the rock,” he said.
By Friday evening, English had stopped for the night, because of more flooding on the roads. He was just a few hours from home, where he said a couple of beers awaited him. His wife had been back for days — she’d simply flown home from Perth. (Driving to Broome had never been strictly necessary, but it meant they could book a cheaper flight.)
English had logged more miles than the distance from Moscow to Gibraltar. But he didn’t consider it remarkable. “Driving doesn’t bother me,” he said. “It’s just something I like to do.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The organization adopted a new name, Embers, for the branch after current and former members said that the old one was a barrier to belonging.
The Girl Guides, Canada's equivalent of the Girl Scouts, has renamed its Brownies branch in an effort to become more inclusive, after current and former members who are people of color said that the name had caused them harm.
Girls in the branch, which is for 7- and 8-year-olds, will now be called Embers after an online vote by members, the Girl Guides of Canada announced on Wednesday.
"Our vision is a better world by girls and that means by all girls," Jill Zelmanovits, chief executive of Girl Guides of Canada, said in an interview on Thursday. "So if we were not including a certain portion, or if girls were feeling like they didn't belong, we wanted to change so that as many girls as possible could be members of the organization."
The Girl Guides announced in November that it would be retiring the Brownies name to create a more welcoming atmosphere. A few weeks later, members were asked to vote online for the new name, either Embers or Comets. The organization said it had about 58,000 girl members and about 15,000 adult members, most of whom are troop leaders.
The names of the other branches -- Sparks, Guides, Pathfinders and Rangers -- will remain the same.
Ms. Zelmanovits said that the organization first became aware of objections to the Brownies name after the murder of George Floyd in May 2020 set off global protests against racial injustice.
She said that former members shared stories about not wanting their daughters to join the organization because of their own experiences with the name. Others said that they had joined as Sparks, left the Girl Guides and then returned after Brownies or waited to join the Girl Guides until after they had reached an age that would allow them to join a branch other than the Brownies.
"It was a surprise to many people," Ms. Zelmanovits said. "We hadn't seen the name necessarily in that light as causing harm."
She said the organization had prepared to have difficult conversations about the name change and created a specific guide for leaders who would need to explain it to the girls in the affected branch.
"They were the ones who had the least difficulty with it," Ms. Zelmanovits said. "When the leaders sat down and started having the discussions at a very basic level and said, 'Some girls your age don't feel like they belong because of the name,' the girls were just immediately: 'You should change it."'
The name change will be phased in over the next few months as the organization updates its websites, training sessions, marketing materials and other resources, the organization said. The Embers name is expected to be fully adopted by September.
The name Brownies is still used by similar organizations, including Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. and Girlguiding in Britain.
The Girl Scouts said in a statement that it supported "all our sister organizations throughout the world in making decisions that best reflect the wellness and intentions of their communities and, most importantly, girls."
"Girl Scouts of U.S.A. made a pledge to become an antiracist organization and provide an inclusive space for girls of color and their families," the organization said. "We are dedicated to carrying out this pledge, and we are currently evaluating all aspects of our program to ensure alignment with this commitment."
In an online F.A.Q. about the name change, the Girl Guides of Canada said that the name change was not about the origin of the name Brownies, which it said was from folklore, but about how it made girls feel.
"This was a name that made them feel extremely uncomfortable, prompted teasing and racist comments and was a barrier to feeling that they belong at Girl Guides," the organization said. "Continuing to use a name that we have been directly told by girls has caused them harm would go against everything that we stand for as an organization."
An animated video promoting the name change shows glowing orange and red embers against a navy background. Words appear onscreen that say, "As an Ember, you have potential that's just waiting to be unleashed."

Sales Dip on Chip Snags, but Ford Gains With E.V.s: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company's production was limited by a global chip shortage, but it made big gains in the fastest-growing segment of the auto market.
Ford Motor reported Thursday that its new-vehicle sales fell 2 percent in 2022 as shortages of computer chips and other supply disruptions slowed its production of trucks and sport utility vehicles.
The automaker said it sold 1.85 million cars and light trucks in the United States last year, as well as 13,539 heavy trucks.
Ford's sales decline was in step with most other automakers. Overall, the industry sold about 13.8 million new vehicles in 2022, about one million fewer than in 2021, according to Edmunds, a market research firm. On Wednesday, Toyota, Honda, Nissan and Stellantis reported significant declines in 2022 sales. General Motors was an exception: Its new-vehicle sales rose 2.5 percent, to 2.3 million vehicles.
For the last two years, automakers around the world have been hampered by a shortage of semiconductors, the tiny brains used in electronic devices that control a vehicle's engine, transmission, display screen and other major components. The chip shortage eased somewhat in 2022, but other supply problems were caused by Covid-19 outbreaks that at times interrupted production of key parts in China and Southeast Asia.
Supply issues limited the number of pickup trucks that Ford was able to produce, and sales of its F-Series trucks fell 10 percent, to 653,957 vehicles, although the F-Series remained the top-selling vehicle line in the U.S. market.
One bright spot for Ford was the introduction last spring of an electric pickup truck, the F-150 Lightning. The company said it sold 15,617 Lightnings in 2022, fewer than expected as it ramped up production of battery packs for the vehicle.
Ford also said it sold 6,500 electric delivery vans. Sales of an electric S.U.V, the Mustang Mach E, increased 45 percent, to 39,458 vehicles.
The company is counting on a surge in electric vehicle sales to drive growth this year. The automaker is building two battery plants in Kentucky and a third battery plant and a new electric truck plant in Tennessee.

Supply Problems and Falling Demand Hurt Auto Sales: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A global semiconductor shortage is easing, which could allow carmakers to lift production this year. But higher interest rates could keep sales low.
Last year, sales of new cars and trucks fell to their lowest level in a decade because automakers could not make enough vehicles for consumers to buy. This year, sales are likely to remain soft, but for an entirely different reason -- weakening demand.
The Federal Reserve's interest rate increases, which are intended to slow inflation, have made it harder and more expensive for consumers to finance automobile purchases, after prices had already risen to record highs.
Analysts expect that higher rates and a slowing economy will force some U.S. shoppers to delay car purchases or steer away from showrooms altogether in 2023 even if automakers crank out more vehicles than they did last year because they can get more parts.
"For over a decade, low interest rates have helped people buy the big cars that Americans like," said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at Edmunds, a market research firm. "Low rates from the Fed are what made those attractive offers for zero-percent financing and 72-month loans possible, but with the higher rates, it's a pretty unfriendly market for people buying a car."
Edmunds estimates that automakers will sell 14.8 million cars and trucks in the United States this year, which would be well below the sales that automakers became accustomed to in the previous decade.
Analysts expect the industry will have sold fewer than 14 million light trucks and cars last year in the United States once large automakers have reported their deliveries for the year. That would be a decline of more than one million from 2021. Before the coronavirus pandemic, the industry typically sold more than 17 million new vehicles a year.
If the dour estimates are confirmed, last year's sales total will rank as the lowest since 2011, when the industry had only just begun recovering from the financial crisis and sold 12.7 million new cars and trucks.
"It seems likely that rising interest rates are now constraining demand in the retail auto market," Charles Chesbrough, senior economist at the market researcher Cox Automotive, said in a statement. "With record-high prices and elevated loan rates, the pool of potential new-vehicle buyers is shrinking."
Stellantis, the company formed through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, said its U.S. sales fell 13 percent in 2022. Honda reported a drop of by 33 percent, and Nissan's sales fell 25 percent. A main reason was the continuing shortage of computer chips, which forced manufacturers to slow or halt production at times over the last two years and left dealers with few vehicles to sell.
Toyota Motor, the world's largest automaker by number of vehicles sold, said on Wednesday that its U.S. sales fell about 10 percent, to 2.1 million vehicles in 2022. But in an indication that the supply of chips and other parts improved toward the end of the year, the company said sales in the fourth quarter jumped 13 percent from a year earlier.
General Motors was one of the few automakers that bucked the industry trend, reporting a 2.5 percent increase in U.S. sales last year, to 2.3 million vehicles, putting it just ahead of Toyota after G.M. fell to second place for the first time in decades in 2021. G.M. said deliveries in the fourth quarter were up 41 percent.
Sales of G.M.'s electric car, the Chevrolet Bolt, rose more than 50 percent to 38,120 for the year. The company also said sales of the GMC Hummer, an electric pickup truck that sells for more than $ 100,000, increased to 854. The company, which has said it aims to do away with internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035, is counting on several new electric models to increase sales this year.
Another company that did relatively well was Hyundai, the South Korean automaker that sells cars under the Hyundai and Kia brands and that has also made a big push into electric vehicles. It's full-year sales fell just 2 percent, and its fourth-quarter deliveries jumped 29 percent.
Sales were strong for electric vehicles and for companies that specialize in that fast-growing business.
Tesla on Monday reported a 40 percent increase in its global sales for 2022, but its deliveries in the last three months of the year fell short of analysts' expectations. The company's stock, which ended down 65 percent last year, fell 12 percent on Tuesday. It rose 5 percent on Wednesday by the close of trading.
And Rivian, a smaller electric vehicle company, said on Tuesday that it fell several hundred vehicles short of its goal of producing 25,000 trucks, sport utility vehicles and vans in 2022.
Ford Motor is expected to report its sales on Thursday.
Automakers have been hampered by forces beyond their control for much of the past three years. The pandemic forced them to idle factories for two months in 2020. Then, starting in early 2021, they had to limit production because of the chip shortage.
The shortage has eased, and dealer inventories have improved but remain below normal levels. G.M. said its dealers had 410,000 cars in stock, about half the number before the pandemic.
Many automakers are also struggling to acquire enough batteries for their electric cars and trucks. Some people have been waiting months to buy certain models, like Ford's F-150 Lightning and G.M.'s Hummer pickup trucks.
Many consumers who want to buy new vehicles are also staying away from showrooms because the chip shortage has pushed prices higher. The Fed interest rate increases have also effectively made cars more expensive because many people must borrow money to buy a new vehicle.
According to Edmunds, U.S. consumers on average paid $ 47,681 for new vehicles in November, the most recent month for which data is available. That was a record high and up from $ 45,872 in November 2021. And the average monthly payment on car loans rose in the fourth quarter to $ 717 from $ 659, Ms. Caldwell said.

Full text: What's Up? (Dec. 25-31)
Stranded at the Airport
Thousands of travelers were stranded in airports across the country over the holidays as Southwest Airlines canceled more than 2,900 flights on Monday and roughly 5,000 over Tuesday and Wednesday, more than 60 percent of its schedule. The disruptions were the result of staffing shortages and longstanding technological problems compounded by a fierce winter storm. Many customers said Southwest had done little or nothing to get them to their destinations. The airline's chief executive of 10 months, Bob Jordan, apologized, and the company said it had called on over 1,000 corporate employees to manually schedule crews for new flights. But Southwest's reputation is in tatters, and the scale of the chaos -- which one industry analyst called "the worst round of cancellations for any single airline" in recent memory -- has prompted the Department of Transportation to announce that it would look into whether Southwest was meeting its obligations to customers.
A Bare-Bones Twitter
As part of a series of drastic cost-cutting measures, on Christmas Eve Elon Musk sent members of his staff to a data center in Sacramento, one of Twitter's three main computing storage facilities, to disconnect servers key to keeping the site running smoothly. (And many users seemed to notice.) The company is facing eviction from its Seattle office and has cut security and janitorial services at others, with some employees bringing their own toilet paper to the increasingly bare-bones operation. Mr. Musk has also continued to conduct smaller-scale layoffs after the mass job cuts he carried out when he first took over the company in late October: He now says there are about 2,000 people working for Twitter, far fewer than the 7,500 he started with. And workers expect still more layoffs as the company faces a depressed advertising environment and increased costs, like the debt payments from Mr. Musk's purchase.
Accusations Against JPMorgan Chase
The attorney general of the U.S. Virgin Islands has filed a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase, accusing the bank of helping to conceal the exploitation of women and girls by the convicted financier Jeffrey Epstein and continuing to provide him with banking services after he pleaded guilty to sex charges in 2008. Mr. Epstein had been a client of the bank's for 15 years, including for five after his conviction; the bank ejected him in 2013. The suit, filed on Tuesday in federal court in Manhattan, described JPMorgan as "indispensable to the operation and concealment of the Epstein trafficking enterprise," arguing that the bank's delay in cutting ties with Mr. Epstein helped enable his sexual abuse. The legal filing originated in the Virgin Islands because of Mr. Epstein's illegal activities at a villa on an island in the territory, Little St. James Island, which he owned.
What's Next? (Jan. 1-7)
New Year, New S&P?
We may be able to make resolutions for more positive habits in the new year. But will the stock markets follow suit? After a tumultuous year that was its worst annual performance since 2008, some analysts believe things will start to look up for the S&P 500 in 2023. But predictions, perhaps predictably, are mixed. Some forecast a serious downturn on the horizon, while others feel optimistic that markets will lift as a result of a pivot from the Federal Reserve, which has aggressively raised rates in 2022 but could begin slowing down as inflation continues to moderate. According to Bloomberg, the average forecast for the index is that it will end the year at 4,009, which is the most bearish outlook in more than two decades. But the range of predictions -- from a low of 3,400 to a high of 4,500 -- represents an unusually wide gulf in opinion.
Incentives for E.V. Drivers
A law that takes effect Sunday will both expand and scramble the list of electric vehicles eligible for federal tax credits, including models from Ford Motor, Nissan, Volkswagen, Tesla and Volvo. Under the legislation, which is part of the climate and energy package that was approved by Congress in August, drivers of those and other eligible vehicles qualify for up to $ 7,500 in the credits. But auto industry representatives have said that the law, meant to give incentives to companies to make battery-powered vehicles and customers to buy them, comes with too many strings attached. Also confusing: Other parts of the legislation will not be carried out until March, when the Biden administration intends to add new rules devised to force carmakers to buy batteries and raw materials from domestic suppliers and trade allies.
The Latest Jobs Numbers
The last three consecutive jobs reports have been in close range. Employers added 263,000 jobs in September, 261,000 in October and 263,000 in November, a sign that despite a considerable drop-off since earlier in the year, the labor market is still strong. So far, it's been more resistant to the Fed's efforts to slow down the economy than officials would like. But on Friday, the latest data from the Labor Department could show that the Fed is starting to make a bigger dent in the jobs numbers, with analysts forecasting 200,000 new jobs in December. The Fed is aiming for a target of 100,000 jobs added per month.
What Else?
Employees at Google have so far escaped the mass layoffs sweeping the tech industry, but they are bracing for cuts. After President Biden helped impose a contract on railroad workers, some union leaders called into question his claims of being the "most pro-union president." Brian X. Chen, The Times's consumer tech columnist, predicts virtual reality and A.I. tools will become more entrenched in 2023.
