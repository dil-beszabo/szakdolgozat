Abstract: None available.

Full text: A businessman who had worked in China for decades vanished from view in 2018, but his fate had been unknown, and publicly unremarked upon, until now.
A British businessman who disappeared from public view in China in 2018 was sentenced to five years in prison in 2022, China's Foreign Ministry said on Friday, in its first public acknowledgment of the case.
The businessman, Ian J. Stones, had lived in China since the 1970s, working for companies like General Motors and Pfizer. For years after he vanished, there was no public information about his whereabouts, though some in the business community privately discussed his secret detention.
A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said that Mr. Stones had been convicted in 2022 of "buying and unlawfully supplying intelligence for an organization or individual outside China." Mr. Stones's appeal of the verdict was rejected in September 2023, said the spokesman, Wang Wenbin.
Mr. Wang was responding to reporters' questions at a regularly scheduled news conference, after The Wall Street Journal reported Mr. Stones's case on Thursday.
"The Chinese courts heard the trial strictly in accordance with the law," Mr. Wang said, adding that China "protects the lawful rights of Chinese and foreign parties."
It is unclear when Mr. Stones will be released and whether he will be given credit for time served before his conviction.
Laura Stones, Mr. Stones's daughter, did not respond to a request for comment. But she told The Journal that the Chinese authorities had not given her or British Embassy staff access to the legal documents in the case, nor allowed them to attend the trial.
The revelation is likely to deepen concerns among foreign companies about the risks of operating in China in an increasingly insular political climate, led by China's leader, Xi Jinping, and the country's powerful security agencies.
China revised its already sweeping counterespionage law last year to expand the definition of spying and has warned repeatedly in recent months about the dangers of interactions with foreigners. Officials also raided last year the offices of several American companies and detained some Chinese employees.
Foreign governments have at times accused China of arresting foreigners as political pawns, as in the case of two Canadians arrested in 2018 after Canada detained a prominent Chinese technology executive. An Australian businessman and writer, Yang Hengjun, is still in detention in China, and an Australian journalist, Cheng Lei, was released in October. Both had been accused of unrelated national security offenses and have denied wrongdoing.
There is no official tally of the number of foreigners detained in China. Information about the charges against them is usually highly limited. While detained foreigners' governments or relatives sometimes speak up about their cases, some remain quiet, possibly in hopes of negotiating behind the scenes with Beijing.
Mr. Stones, who is around 70, had worked as a senior manager for General Motors Asia, helping it to expand in China in the 1990s, and as a manager in China for Pfizer Pharmaceuticals. At the time of his detention, he had been working for over a decade as a consultant advising investors on deals, regulations and disputes in China, according to his LinkedIn page, which is no longer available online.
With his decades of experience in the country and fluency in Chinese, he was well known among Western investors and executives in Beijing. On LinkedIn, Mr. Stones said that Navisino Partners, a consulting company where he was a partner, specialized in "finding solutions to difficult challenges, structuring deals, work-outs, turnarounds."
He also had relationships with Chinese government agencies; he had presented to China's National Bureau of Statistics, according to an annual report in 2007 by The Conference Board, a New York-based business research group where he was a senior adviser.
The length of Mr. Stones's tenure in China made him among the best-connected foreigners in Beijing, said Peter Humphrey, a British private investigator who met Mr. Stones in China in the late 1970s. Mr. Humphrey was detained for two years in China on charges of illegally obtaining information and deported after his release in 2015; he has said he believed his work in China was legal.
Some of the people Mr. Stones met during his early days in China went on to become high-level officials, Mr. Humphrey said, which made him an especially sought-after business figure.
But by 2015, Mr. Stones knew he was potentially at risk, Mr. Humphrey said. The two men met then in Britain, not long after Mr. Humphrey's release, and Mr. Stones told him that he had been asked to speak with state security officials and was under surveillance.
"He seemed to think he could handle it," Mr. Humphrey said. "Obviously he was wrong."
Mr. Humphrey's account could not be independently verified.
The circumstances around Mr. Stones's arrest remain opaque, and it is unknown what communications have taken place between the British and Chinese governments. Britain's foreign office declined to comment.
Mr. Stones's detention coincides with a period in which the British government has taken a tougher line on China, often siding with the United States' critical positions. In 2020, it banned Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications equipment company, from involvement in Britain's new high-speed wireless network, a decision that Beijing condemned.
London's ties with Beijing have also deteriorated over China's continuing suppression of civil rights in Hong Kong, a former British colony. Britain has also criticized China over its repression of Muslims in the Xinjiang region, its military pressure on Taiwan and its continued partnership with Russia despite the war in Ukraine.

China's Economy Grew 5.2% in '23, But Strains Lurk: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Gross domestic product expanded 5.2 percent, as China worked to export more to make up for weak demand, high debt and a steep property contraction at home.
Car production set records in China last year. Restaurants and hotels were increasingly full. Construction of new factories surged.
Yet China's economic strengths conceal weaknesses. Deep discounts helped drive car sales, particularly for electric cars. Diners and travelers chose cheaper dishes and less expensive hotels. Many factories ran at half capacity or less because of weak demand inside China, and are working to export more to make up for it.
China's economy grew 5.2 percent last year as it rebounded from nearly three years of stringent "zero Covid" pandemic control measures, the country's National Bureau of Statistics announced on Wednesday. During the final three months of the year, output rose at an annual pace of 4.1 percent.
Longer term, China's growth is slowing. High debt, a housing crisis that has undermined confidence, and a shrinking and aging work force are weighing on output.
Western economists predict that growth will be 4.5 percent or less this year, the result not of a cyclical downturn but of a grinding decline that may endure for many years, what economists label secular stagnation. Prices are gradually falling to an extent that China hadn't experienced since the jolt inflicted by the global financial crisis in 2009, a phenomenon known as deflation that could bankrupt heavily indebted families and companies.
"Secular stagnation -- basically a chronic excess of savings leading to slow growth, deflation, asset bubbles and financial strains -- has moved from the Western Hemisphere to China," Lawrence H. Summers, a former secretary of the Treasury, said in an interview last week in Shanghai.
Heavy debts, and the steep interest payments they require, are limiting China's room to maneuver. Ever since the financial crisis, the central and local governments have responded to economic weakness by spending more for new roads and other infrastructure and by lending more to manufacturers in favored industries. That has juiced growth but resulted in ever-rising debt, particularly at the local level.
Last month, the credit rating agency Moody's issued a negative outlook for the Chinese government's financial health. Another agency, DBRS Morningstar in Chicago, downgraded in November its rating for China's government debt.
Rohini Malkani, a senior vice president of sovereign debt ratings at DBRS Morningstar, expressed concern that overall debt in the Chinese economy now exceeds three years' economic output -- a higher level than in industrialized countries like the United States.
"Over the past 15 years, it has more than doubled" compared even with the country's fast-growing output, she said.
Zhang Jun, dean of the School of Economics at Fudan University in Shanghai, said in a commentary distributed by the East Is Read newsletter in Beijing that the Chinese government was becoming less willing to stimulate the economy by borrowing and spending for infrastructure. As a result, he wrote, "I increasingly feel that the growth slowdown has a certain inevitability."
The economy's performance last year was roughly in line with a consensus of 5.3 percent in a survey of economists last week by Caixin, a Chinese news organization. The economy also met the government's target, set last March, that growth would be about 5 percent. Premier Li Qiang said on Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that the increase last year had been "around 5.2 percent."
Many investors have been hoping that China would increase its economic stimulus, but Mr. Li emphasized on Tuesday that China had achieved growth last year without doing so. The Shanghai stock market fell 0.8 percent and shares in Hong Kong tumbled 2.6 percent after the report was released.
Kang Yi, the commissioner of the National Bureau of Statistics, said at a news briefing that, "the national economy witnessed momentum of recovery, the high-quality development was advanced steadily, the major expected targets were well achieved."
Also on Wednesday, the statistics agency resumed releasing the unemployment rate for people aged 16 to 24, which it had halted last summer after the unemployment rate for young people hit 21.3 percent in June. The rate was 14.9 percent in December, partly reflecting a decline in youth unemployment in the winter as last summer's graduates find work or enroll in further education.
Mr. Kang said the agency was no longer counting as unemployed many students who may look for part-time or short-term jobs while still in school.
Last year's performance represented a significant rebound from 2022, when the economy grew only 3 percent. A two-month Covid lockdown in Shanghai in the spring of 2022 disrupted production across much of central China and produced a steep, nationwide drop in consumer confidence, which has stayed low.
Many economists had predicted that 2023 would show a big rebound compared with such a weak base. But after a strong start, spending flagged. Housing prices fell, leaving households feeling less financially secure. And Beijing weakened the country's social safety net. Among other measures, policymakers a year ago ended a broad unemployment insurance program set up during the pandemic, so as to pressure people to find jobs.
All but the most affluent households kept a close watch on their spending. Many restaurateurs complained of sharp drops in average tabs, while hotel executives fretted that travelers chose less expensive rooms.
About 6,000 eateries closed in Shanghai during the pandemic, but another 7,500 have opened in the past year, said Chris St. Cavish, a food critic and industry analyst in the city, China's most populous. Growth in the industry has occurred almost entirely among inexpensive cafes charging less than $ 14 a person and among luxury restaurants that charge as much as $ 1,000 a person.
"The middle is a difficult place for a restaurant to be right now," Mr. St. Cavish said.
The biggest anxiety about China's economy in the coming year is the same one as in each of the past two years: What will happen in the country's housing market crash? Existing homes are already selling for about one-fifth less than at their peak in the summer of 2021, and that is when buyers can be found at all. The pace of transactions has slowed.
The sharpest effects of the real estate troubles have been felt in developers' struggles to raise money and start new projects. Investors worry that as developers finish work on previously promised apartments in the coming months, the volume of construction could fall steeply.
Tao Wang, chief China economist at the Swiss bank UBS, said the long fall in construction activity had not ended, although activity was unlikely to plunge. She added that "there is a risk that housing prices will fall more and that household confidence will be hurt more."
China's state-controlled banking system has shifted its priorities rapidly in the past year. Few loans are being made to real estate developers and home buyers. Loans to industrial companies for factory construction have soared instead.
Manufacturing investment climbed 6.5 percent last year, while real estate development dropped 9.6 percent, the government said Wednesday.
Much of the increased factory output is being sold overseas. China's trade surplus in manufactured goods equals about 10 percent of the country's economic output. Exports fell last year in dollar terms because China's currency weakened considerably, although they have resumed rising since November and could climb further. Multinational retailers are finishing the sale of excess inventories they accumulated at the end of the pandemic and have begun placing new orders.
"China's exports are likely to explode to the upside," said Hayden Briscoe, a senior UBS asset management strategist.
All over China, car factories are being built in a frenzy. Vehicle exports climbed 58 percent last year, and China surpassed Japan to become the world's largest car exporter.
The question now is how to persuade Chinese households to stop parking much of their income in bank accounts and start spending again. "Dealing with a chronic excess of savings may be the defining macroeconomic challenge of China for the next decade," Mr. Summers said.

A Rare Discount by Apple On New iPhones in China: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Facing a weak consumer appetite and fierce competition from domestic rivals amid U.S.-China tensions, a typically discount-wary Apple is offering a four-day sale.
Ever bought a discounted new phone from Apple? For most people, the answer is no. That's because Apple doesn't really do discounts.
But in China, Apple is slashing the price of some of its latest iPhones by $ 70 amid worries that Chinese consumers have cooled on the brand. That would save a buyer about 6 to 8 percent, based on prices on Apple's China website. It has also knocked $ 112 off the price of some MacBook Air laptops. The sale will start on Thursday and run through Sunday.
Cutting prices on high-end electronics to buyers in China is an unexpected move for Apple, one that highlights the challenges the American company faces in China, where patriotic shoppers are choosing domestic brands amid rising U.S.-China tensions.
Apple and its Chinese rival, Huawei, are on the front lines of a battle over technology between Beijing and Washington that has seen both countries restrict access to foreign technology. Long suspicious of Huawei's close ties to the Chinese government and wary that its technology could be used for spying, American officials have stopped federal agencies from buying equipment from Huawei and tried to discourage other countries as well.
China, for its part, has issued directives to some of its government employees not to use iPhones at work and encouraged domestic brands.
The tit-for-tat is not good for business. Apple has a lot to lose from the surge in tensions between the United States and China, a huge market that accounts for one-fifth of its overall revenue.
Overall sales of smartphones in China fell about 3 percent in 2023 because of the country's slowing economy. It is also the only major economy to sink into deflation as Chinese cut spending, and household savings rose to a high point.
Huawei has taken aim at Apple's market share in China, most recently unveiling a smartphone with an enhanced camera, something that Apple has long advertised as a selling point.
Apple said in November that its overall sales in China had fallen 2.5 percent. The company has reported a drop in sales for three quarters over the last year.
Discounts are not unusual ahead of the Lunar New Year, which is next month and one of the biggest shopping periods of the year in China. Apple's current promotion includes an image of a giant dragon made of iPhones, Apple watches and AirPods, in a nod to the upcoming year of the dragon in the Chinese zodiac.
The discounts prompted debate on Chinese social media on Monday.
"Apple will only cut the price of its phones when domestic phones become more popular," wrote a well-known blogger known as Victorious Zhang Beihai. Another commentator wrote: "It is still too expensive. I support domestic phones."
Apple's Lunar New Year promotion is "a move not commonly seen in the past," said Toby Zhu, a senior analyst at Canalys, a market research firm. Canalys's research indicates that Apple's sales in China fell last summer compared to 2022, but that the company still holds about 66 percent of the market for high-end smartphones in China.
Mr. Zhu added that the models of iPhones under promotion appear to have already sold out.
Still, he added, "it does indicate the challenges Apple is facing in the mainland China market."

Microsoft Takes Crown From Apple: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The shift is indicative of the importance of new artificial intelligence technology to Silicon Valley and Wall Street investors.
For more than a decade, Apple was the stock market's undisputed king. It first overtook Exxon Mobil as the world's most valuable public company in 2011 and held the title almost without interruption.
But a transfer of power has begun.
On Friday, Microsoft surpassed Apple, claiming the crown after its market value surged by more than $ 1 trillion over the past year. Microsoft finished the day at $ 2.89 trillion, higher than Apple's $ 2.87 trillion, according to Bloomberg.
The change is part of a reordering of the stock market that was set in motion by the advent of generative artificial intelligence. The technology, which can answer questions, create images and write code, has been heralded for its potential to disrupt businesses and create trillions of dollars in economic value.
When Apple replaced Exxon, it ushered in an era of tech supremacy. The values of Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Google dwarfed former market leaders like Walmart, JPMorgan Chase and General Motors.
The tech industry still dominates the top of the list, but the companies with the most momentum have put generative A.I. at the forefront of their future business plans. The combined value of Microsoft, Nvidia and Alphabet, Google's parent company, increased by $ 2.5 trillion last year. Their performances outshined Apple, which posted a smaller share price increase in 2023.
"It simply comes down to gen A.I.," said Brad Reback, an analyst at the investment bank Stifel. Generative A.I. will have an impact on all of Microsoft's businesses, including its largest, he said, while "Apple doesn't have much of an A.I. story yet."
Microsoft and Apple declined to comment.
Microsoft has not led a technology transition since the personal computing era, when its Windows operating system dominated sales. It was late to the internet, mobile phone and social media.
When Satya Nadella became Microsoft's chief executive in 2014, the company was floundering. He refocused it on the growing cloud computing business, turning it into a strong challenger to Amazon, the pioneer in the field. Then Mr. Nadella pushed the company forward again, making an aggressive bet on generative A.I.
In 2019, Mr. Nadella made Microsoft's first of several investments in OpenAI, the start-up that would build the A.I.-powered ChatGPT chatbot. In the end of the summer of 2022, he was impressed by a preview of OpenAI's underlying technology, known as GPT-4, and soon began prodding Microsoft to add generative A.I. to its products at what he called a "frantic pace."
He started with adding a chatbot to the Bing search engine, but then began pushing A.I. into the Windows operating system and productive applications like Excel and Outlook, and offering OpenAI's systems to customers of Azure, Microsoft's flagship cloud computing product.
The revenue has only just started to show up in Microsoft's financial results. Generative A.I. accounted for about three percentage points of growth to Azure in the three months that ended in September, and the $ 30-a-month offering inside Microsoft's productivity software began a general release only in November.
(The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft, accusing them of copyright infringement.)
This isn't the first time that Microsoft has pulled ahead of Apple in recent years. It did so in 2018, as its cloud-computing business began to flourish, and in 2021, when the pandemic disrupted Apple's iPhone operations. But this change could be more indicative of a fundamental shift in the tech industry.
"The question is: Who has the better mouse trap to go to the next level of $ 3.5 trillion?" said Dan Morgan, portfolio manager and analyst at Synovus Trust, a bank in the Southeast. "You can make the case that Microsoft is in the better position. Apple has been struggling for the next big thing."
The iPhone, which debuted in 2007, catapulted Apple to the top of the stock market. Between 2009 and 2015, the company went from selling 20 million iPhones a year to more than 200 million.
When device sales slowed in recent years, Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, shifted the company's focus from selling more iPhones to selling people more apps and services on their existing iPhones. The strategy helped Apple's annual revenue soar to $ 383 billion, a nearly fourfold increase from the end of 2011, the year that Steve Jobs, Apple's co-founder, died.
Mr. Cook's strategy has shown signs of fatigue. The iPhone, which accounts for more than half of Apple's revenue, has become known more for its incremental improvements each year than its noteworthy innovations. Purchases of iPads and Macs have declined. And the sales growth of its services such as Apple Music are slowing.
Last year, the company's sales fell for four consecutive quarters. But shares of Apple still rose around 50 percent last year, and investors lifted its market value to nearly $ 3 trillion because of their belief that demand for the iPhone would continue.
Wall Street analysts have predicted that this year's iPhone sales will be weak. The company is facing challenges in China, where Huawei has released a new phone and the government is restricting the use of foreign smartphones.
While Microsoft and others have been building new generative A.I. businesses, Apple has been absent from the conversation. During a call with analysts last year, Mr. Cook said Apple had work "going on" connected to A.I., but he declined to elaborate.
Last year, Apple engineers were testing a large language model, which can power a chatbot, The Times reported. The company has also held discussions with publishers about acquiring material to train generative A.I. systems. But it has yet to release anything publicly.
"Apple needs to take note that if they want to maintain their spot as one of the most innovative tech companies, they have to get behind A.I. in a big way," said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management.
Apple has been focused on the release of an augmented reality headset, the Vision Pro. The device, which will ship Feb. 2, is the first major new product category that the company has released since the Apple Watch in 2014. Analysts project Apple will sell fewer than half a million units.

SAN FRANCISCO — For more than a decade, Apple was the stock market’s undisputed king. It first overtook Exxon Mobil Corp. as the world’s most valuable public company in 2011 and held the title almost without interruption.
But a transfer of power has begun.
On Friday, Microsoft surpassed Apple, claiming the crown after its market value surged by more than $1 trillion over the past year. Microsoft finished the day at $2.89 trillion, higher than Apple’s $2.87 trillion, according to Bloomberg.
The change is part of a reordering of the stock market that was set in motion by the advent of generative artificial intelligence. The technology, which can answer questions, create images and write code, has been heralded for its potential to disrupt businesses and create trillions of dollars in economic value.
When Apple replaced Exxon, it ushered in an era of tech supremacy. The values of Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Google dwarfed former market leaders such as Walmart, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and General Motors.
The tech industry still dominates the top of the list, but the companies with the most momentum have put generative AI at the forefront of their future business plans. The combined value of Microsoft, Nvidia and Alphabet, Google’s parent company, increased by $2.5 trillion last year. Their performances outshined Apple, which posted a smaller share price increase in 2023.
“It simply comes down to gen AI,” said Brad Reback, an analyst at the investment bank Stifel. Generative AI will have an impact on all of Microsoft’s businesses, including its largest, he said, while “Apple doesn’t have much of an AI story yet.”
Microsoft and Apple declined to comment.
Microsoft has not led a technology transition since the personal computing era, when its Windows operating system dominated sales. It was late to the internet, mobile phone and social media.
When Satya Nadella became Microsoft’s CEO in 2014, the company was floundering. He refocused it on the growing cloud computing business, turning it into a strong challenger to Amazon, the pioneer in the field. Then Nadella pushed the company forward again, making an aggressive bet on generative AI.
In 2019, Nadella made Microsoft’s first of several investments in OpenAI, the startup that would build the AI-powered ChatGPT chatbot. In the end of the summer of 2022, he was impressed by a preview of OpenAI’s underlying technology, known as GPT-4, and soon began prodding Microsoft to add generative AI to its products at what he called a “frantic pace.”
He started with adding a chatbot to the Bing search engine, but then began pushing AI into the Windows operating system and productive applications such as Excel and Outlook, and offering OpenAI’s systems to customers of Azure, Microsoft’s flagship cloud computing product.
The revenue has only just started to show up in Microsoft’s financial results. Generative AI accounted for about 3 percentage points of growth to Azure in the three months that ended in September, and the $30-a-month offering inside Microsoft’s productivity software began a general release only in November.
This isn’t the first time that Microsoft has pulled ahead of Apple in recent years. It did so in 2018, as its cloud-computing business began to flourish, and in 2021, when the pandemic disrupted Apple’s iPhone operations. But this change could be more indicative of a fundamental shift in the tech industry.
“The question is: Who has the better mousetrap to go to the next level of $3.5 trillion?” said Dan Morgan, portfolio manager and analyst at Synovus Trust, a bank in the Southeast. “You can make the case that Microsoft is in the better position. Apple has been struggling for the next big thing.”
The iPhone, which debuted in 2007, catapulted Apple to the top of the stock market. Between 2009 and 2015, the company went from selling 20 million iPhones a year to more than 200 million.
When device sales slowed in recent years, Apple CEO Tim Cook shifted the company’s focus from selling more iPhones to selling people more apps and services on their existing iPhones. The strategy helped Apple’s annual revenue soar to $383 billion, a nearly fourfold increase from the end of 2011, the year that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs died.
Cook’s strategy has shown signs of fatigue. The iPhone, which accounts for more than half of Apple’s revenue, has become known more for its incremental improvements each year than its noteworthy innovations. Purchases of iPads and Macs have declined. And the sales growth of its services such as Apple Music are slowing.
Last year, the company’s sales fell for four consecutive quarters. But shares of Apple still rose around 50% last year, and investors lifted its market value to nearly $3 trillion because of their belief that demand for the iPhone would continue.
Wall Street analysts have predicted that this year’s iPhone sales will be weak. The company is facing challenges in China, where Huawei has released a new phone and the government is restricting the use of foreign smartphones.
While Microsoft and others have been building new generative AI businesses, Apple has been absent from the conversation. During a call with analysts last year, Cook said Apple had work “going on” connected to AI, but he declined to elaborate.
Last year, Apple engineers were testing a large language model, which can power a chatbot, the Times reported. The company has also held discussions with publishers about acquiring material to train generative AI systems. But it has yet to release anything publicly.
“Apple needs to take note that if they want to maintain their spot as one of the most innovative tech companies, they have to get behind AI in a big way,” said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management.
Apple has been focused on the release of an augmented reality headset, the Vision Pro. The device, which will ship Feb. 2, is the first major new product category that the company has released since the Apple Watch in 2014. Analysts project Apple will sell fewer than a half-million units.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A U.S.-born chip technology called RISC-V has become critical to China's ambitions. Washington is debating whether and how to limit the technology.
NASA has chosen the technology to help it land future spacecraft on unmapped planets. Meta uses the technology for artificial intelligence. Chinese engineers have turned to it to encrypt data.
And it could represent the next front in the semiconductor trade war between the United States and China.
The technology is RISC-V, pronounced "risk five." It evolved from a university computer lab in California to a foundation for myriad chips that handle computing chores. RISC-V essentially provides a kind of common language for designing processors that are found in devices like smartphones, disk drives, Wi-Fi routers and tablets.
RISC-V has ignited a new debate in Washington in recent months about how far the United States can or should go as it steadily expands restrictions on exporting technology to China that could help advance its military. That's because RISC-V, which can be downloaded from the internet for free, has become a central tool for Chinese companies and government institutions hoping to match U.S. prowess in designing semiconductors.
Last month, the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party -- in an effort spearheaded by Representative Mike Gallagher, Republican of Wisconsin -- recommended that an interagency government committee study potential risks of RISC-V. Congressional aides have met with members of the Biden administration about the technology, and lawmakers and their aides have discussed extending restrictions to stop U.S. citizens from aiding China on RISC-V, according to congressional staff members.
The Chinese Communist Party is "already attempting to use RISC-V's design architecture to undermine our export controls," Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, the ranking Democrat on the House select committee, said in a statement. He added that RISC-V's participants should be focused on advancing technology and "not the geopolitical interests of the Chinese Communist Party."
Arm Holdings, a British company that sells competing chip technology, has also lobbied officials to consider restrictions on RISC-V, three people with knowledge of the situation said. Biden administration officials have concerns about China's use of RISC-V but are wary about potential complications with trying to regulate the technology, according to a person familiar with the discussions. The Department of Commerce and the National Security Council declined to comment.
The debate over RISC-V is complicated because the technology was patterned after open-source software, the free programs like Linux that allow any developer to view and modify the original code used to make them. Such programs have prompted multiple competitors to innovate and reduce the market power of any single vendor.
But RISC-V is not code that can directly be used to make anything. It is a set of basic computing instructions that determine the calculations a chip can perform. Engineers can download these instructions and incorporate them in the much more complex task of creating design blueprints for parts of a semiconductor. Many companies sell RISC-V chip designs, and some universities and other institutions distribute them free.
As with Linux -- but not technologies from companies like Arm and Intel -- engineers around the world can make suggestions to enhance the underlying instructions. That process is overseen by RISC-V International, a nonprofit with more than 4,000 members -- including the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese firms like Huawei and Alibaba, as well as Google and Qualcomm -- in 70 countries.
The group changed its incorporation from the United States to Switzerland in 2020 to calm "concerns of political disruption" and control by any single country. Its leaders said their model mirrored that of other international groups that govern standard technologies like Ethernet and Wi-Fi.
"Open standards have been around for 100 years," Calista Redmond, chief executive of RISC-V International, said in an interview. "This is no different."
Open-source technologies have generally been granted exceptions to U.S. export controls. Any change to that treatment "is certainly going to raise thorny legal issues and important public policy concerns," said Daniel Pickard, a lawyer specializing in trade and national security at Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney.
U.S. regulations limit Arm and RISC-V companies from exporting chip designs to China based on certain performance limits. But trying to restrict the underlying instructions is like trying to control words or letters, Silicon Valley executives said.
"It is absolutely silly," said Dave Ditzel, the chief technology officer of Esperanto Technologies, a chip start-up that uses RISC-V. "It's like saying, 'Well, the Chinese can read a book on nuclear weapons that's written in English, so let's solve the problem by banning the English alphabet."'
As RISC-V helps Chinese firms including Huawei design more of the world's semiconductors, some U.S. officials have raised concerns that Beijing could use Chinese foundries to insert cyber vulnerabilities into chips that may be used to cripple American electrical grids and other critical infrastructure.
RISC-V backers counter that technologies with inner details that can be openly studied are much more secure. Any new restrictions, RISC-V backers said, would weaken U.S. influence over the technology while doing little to hold China back because the instruction set is already widely distributed.
The original inspiration for RISC-V was saving money. Starting in 2010, a professor and two graduate students began developing a new instruction set based on technology pioneered by David Patterson, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who had helped invent reduced instruction set computing, or RISC. The aim was to help study the inner workings of computing without having to pay Arm, which charges royalties for every chip that uses its technology.
"I just wanted to learn how to build computers," said Yunsup Lee, one of the graduate students, who now works at SiFive, a start-up that sells RISC-V designs. Then the goal evolved "to benefit everybody in the world," he said.
The RISC-V variant swiftly attracted interest among engineers. Having a standard set of instructions can allow software programs to work on all chips that use them.
In China, engineers and officials were also quick to see the potential, viewing open-source technology as a way to become self-sufficient and counter risks like embargoes and supply interruptions, Ni Guangnan, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, wrote in an article about RISC-V in June.
In 2019, Mr. Patterson, who now works at Google, helped establish a RISC-V lab in Shenzhen, China, which was supported by an institute set up earlier by Berkeley and Tsinghua University in China. Representative Gallagher, in a video his committee released in November, expressed concerns about the professor's work and collaboration between the institute and organizations with links to Chinese military and intelligence activities.
Mr. Patterson declined to comment through a Google spokeswoman.
A U.C. Berkeley spokesman said that the university's work with the institute had been basic research that was unrestricted, and that the university was responding to requests for information from Congress.
More than 100 "significant" Chinese companies are designing chips with RISC-V today, as are at least 100 more start-ups, said Handel Jones, an analyst at International Business Strategies. Many of the applications are in fairly mundane consumer products, but engineers believe the technology will eventually take over some of the most demanding tasks.
Chinese aerospace scientists have proposed using RISC-V to develop high-performance spaceborne computers. Other Chinese companies and institutions are aiming to string together RISC-V processors to run bigger jobs in data centers, including A.I. applications.
At a RISC-V conference in Silicon Valley in November, T-Head, Alibaba's semiconductor subsidiary, discussed RISC-V designs that Sophgo, another Chinese company, used in a chip powering a large server deployed at Shandong University in China. It's the first instance of RISC-V technology's running a cloud-style computing service, the companies said.
"We just made a small step, but we put RISC-V on the starting line," David Chen, ecosystem director at Alibaba, said at the event.

SAN FRANCISCO — NASA has chosen the technology to help it land future spacecraft on unmapped planets. Meta uses the technology for artificial intelligence. Chinese engineers have turned to it to encrypt data.

Limits Urged On A.I. Giant Tied to China: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A congressional committee made the demand of the Commerce Department after The Times reported on concerns among U.S. intelligence officials over the Emirati company, G42.
A U.S. congressional committee has asked the Commerce Department to look into whether a giant technology company controlled by the ruling family of the United Arab Emirates should be put under trade restrictions because of its ties to China.
The company, G42, specializes in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies, and is overseen by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed, the national security adviser of the Emirates and a younger brother of the country's ruler.
It has signed recent agreements with prominent American technology companies, including Microsoft, Dell and OpenAI. A Silicon Valley chip firm, Cerebras, is building a supercomputer for G42 to create and power A.I. products.
But in a letter sent to the Commerce Department on Wednesday, the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party said the company works extensively with China's "military, intelligence services and state-owned entities," according to a copy obtained by The New York Times. The letter was signed by the chairman of the committee, Representative Mike Gallagher, Republican of Wisconsin.
Officials in the Biden administration have privately expressed similar concerns about the company, which they fear could be a conduit by which advanced American technology is siphoned to Chinese companies or the government, The New York Times reported in November.
Although the Emirates is a U.S. partner and one of the biggest buyers of American weapons, it has increasingly sought military and economic cooperation with China. That has stoked worries among U.S. officials, who often visit the small Persian Gulf nation to discuss security issues. On Monday, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken met in Abu Dhabi with Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, the leader of the Emirates, while on a regional tour focused on the Israel-Gaza war, and the two "underscored the importance of the strategic partnership," the State Department said.
The congressional committee said it had reviewed documents showing that the chief executive of G42, Peng Xiao, "operates and is affiliated with an expansive network of companies that materially support" the Chinese military's technological advancement as well as human rights abuses.
The committee asked the Commerce Department to consider imposing export controls on G42 and 13 companies, most of them based in China, that are owned by it or linked to it.
The controls would prohibit U.S. businesses from selling products to the Emirati and Chinese firms without a department-issued license. The committee said it was giving the Commerce Department until Feb. 2 to act or explain to lawmakers why it was not doing so.
Five of the companies in China, the committee said, are affiliated with the Emirati firm DarkMatter, which has developed spyware and surveillance tools. The letter did not say exactly how the Chinese affiliates, also called DarkMatter, were tied to the Emirati firm.
The C.I.A. has a classified profile of Mr. Xiao. He was born in China and attended college and graduate school in the United States before working at a Virginia technology company, MicroStrategy, which he left in 2014, according to public documents and reports. At some point, he gained U.S. citizenship but renounced it in favor of Emirati citizenship. A G42 representative confirmed his Chinese name is 肖鹏, which appears on the website of the Chinese Embassy in the Emirates.
A spokesperson for the committee declined to disclose the documents it had reviewed.
In a statement, a Commerce Department spokesperson said "we have received the letter and will respond through the appropriate channels."
G42 representatives did not answer emails requesting comment.
American intelligence officials had raised concerns about the company's relationship with China in a series of classified assessments, according to the Times investigation. The report also said top Biden administration officials had pressed their Emirati counterparts to sever the company's ties to China.
Those ties include partnerships with Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant under U.S. government sanctions, and BGI Genomics, which owns companies that the Commerce Department put on restricted lists last March. Some U.S. officials say they worry G42 is helping BGI try to collect genomic data on millions of Americans and others worldwide.
G42 invested $ 100 million last year in ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok, and has investments in other Chinese firms. Its $ 10 billion investment fund, 42X, has a Shanghai office whose new head is Jason Hu, a former executive of JD.com, a large Chinese e-commerce company.
The Biden administration has enacted trade policies to try to keep China from acquiring advanced chips and other tools that would help it surpass the United States in developing emerging technologies, including A.I. and quantum computing.
When The Times contacted G42 for the November article about the administration's concerns, a senior executive, Talal Al Kaissi, said the company sought to "remain in full compliance" with U.S. government regulations. He added that the company had been talking to American companies about replacing its technology infrastructure, which includes Chinese hardware.
After the article was published, Mr. Gallagher said in a briefing with reporters on Nov. 29 that "the trend line of where the U.A.E. is headed in its natural relationship with China is rapidly moving in the wrong direction."
G42 has investments from Mubadala, an Emirati sovereign wealth fund, and Silver Lake, an American private equity firm.
G42 has declined multiple requests from The Times to interview Mr. Xiao. The Financial Times published an interview with Mr. Xiao on Dec. 7 in which he said that G42 was moving to cut ties with Chinese hardware suppliers like Huawei in favor of U.S. firms.
But G42 is tightly intertwined with Chinese business figures and companies. The Wire China reported last month that corporate records show G42's chief investment officer, Zhang Xiaoping, was also the chief operating officer of Yitu Technology, a Chinese company. The Biden administration put Yitu on a sanctions list in 2021 for developing surveillance technology used by Chinese officials in the repression of ethnic Uyghur Muslims.
Mr. Zhang runs two G42 companies in China: G42 Shanghai Investment and Beijing Qingzi Future Network Technology.
In addition, the report said the Beijing firm's general manager, Li Xiaoxu, is also the supervisor of Pegasus Technology China, which was started in 2015 by Pegasus, an Emirati firm where Mr. Xiao was chief executive before he was named to the same role at G42.
All three of those Chinese companies are among the 13 flagged by the congressional committee.
In 2019, an Emirati firm Mr. Xiao led was involved in the launch and operation of a social media app, ToTok, that U.S. intelligence agencies assessed was a spy tool used by the Emirati government to track the conversations of its users. The data harvested from the app, according to an American intelligence assessment, was stored by an Emirati firm called Pax AI, run by Mr. Xiao.
Chinese engineers helped create the app, and a forensic researcher who examined the app in 2019 told The Times it appeared to be a copy of a Chinese messaging app offering free video calls, YeeCall, that was slightly customized for English- and Arabic-speaking audiences.
The congressional letter named YeeCall as one of the companies that the Commerce Department should scrutinize.
And regarding the DarkMatter firms tied to G42 and Mr. Peng, the letter said the network collaborates with Song-Chun Zhu, a lead researcher at the Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence, a top state-supported scientific institution.
One Emirates-based company owned by G42 and named in the congressional letter is Presight AI, which sells surveillance technology to police companies worldwide. In March 2023, a New York Times reporter examined its display at a police conference in Dubai and found signs of close ties to China.
The company advertised itself as a sort of Emirati version of the U.S. data company Palantir. A video display offered a glorified version of the company's capabilities, in which big data analytics foiled a drone attack on an office tower. A separate demonstration showed off the company's physical surveillance capabilities: A software platform used cameras and facial recognition technology to track people at the conference.
The software, which loaded in Chinese before being translated into English, carried a number of hallmarks of Chinese police software. Although a company representative insisted it was built in the Emirates, it had a number of features specifically catered to the China market, like internet cafe monitoring and specialized labels for phone tracking not often seen outside China.
A Presight AI representative at the police conference said the surveillance software had already been sold to a number of countries in Africa and the Middle East, and that it was being used by the Emirati government as well.

How to Stop U.S. Tools From Arming Our Rivals: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The U.S. government's efforts to stop Russia and China from using American equipment to boost their defense sectors have resulted in tough rules -- but leaky enforcement. As a result, American-made tools keep turning up in Russian missile factories and in Huawei's supply chain. With war in Europe and China threatening its neighbors, that's just not good enough.
The United States and its allies make the most advanced tools for both precision metalworking and semiconductor manufacturing. With international tensions rising, the United States and its allies have been right to try to prohibit adversaries from using these tools to manufacture weapons that undermine America's military edge. In October 2022, the United States imposed restrictions on American firms selling and servicing equipment to manufacture chips below the 14-nanometer level, which covers chips necessary for building supercomputers and training frontier artificial intelligence models, aiming to limit China's access to the chip technology used to train A.I. systems for military use. And when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the United States and its allies tightened sales of cutting-edge machine tools to Russia to prevent them from being used for military purposes.
But tough restrictions on paper haven't stopped Russian and Chinese factories from procuring American-made machinery. Industry analysts believe that Chinese chipmakers have succeeded in diverting imported equipment to produce more advanced chips. Many Western and Japanese metalworking machines have been found in Russian defense factories churning out armaments used against Ukrainian cities.
Companies note that their tools can be sold legitimately to one customer and then resold to a Russian or Chinese defense manufacturer without their knowledge. They claim that once a machine is in a customer's hands, they can't control how it is used.
Right now, the Commerce Department tries to enforce export controls by knocking on companies' doors to see if they've violated any rules. However, a 2004 agreement signed by the United States and China permits only two American export control officers to work in China. These two officers average 55 site visits a year, verifying roughly 1 percent of all licenses. Even for the facilities they do visit, companies often have over 100 days between when a request is made and access is granted, giving firms plenty of time for obfuscation. Most U.S. allies have even less effective verification regimes, which is why a disproportionate share of the restricted equipment reaching Russia today is being diverted through them.
We cannot expect foxes, even U.S.-incorporated ones, to guard the henhouse. We believe that some Western firms may prefer not to know too much about their customers, lest it becomes harder for them to turn a blind eye. What's more, companies face commercial incentives to guarantee the confidentiality of customers' data. Because of this, self-policing has been a failure.
So how can the West tighten enforcement of these rules? Companies making controlled tools should be mandated to install tamperproof geolocation in them. An Apple AirTag costs less than $ 30. Manufacturers of million-dollar tools can surely find a cost-effective way of incorporating government-approved geolocation into their dual-use devices and providing real-time verification to the Commerce Department. Ideally, if a prohibited tool were transferred into Russia or a prohibited Chinese plant, it would be disabled automatically. At the very least, investigators would have a track record of where the tool had been.
Geolocation should be just the start. The most complex manufacturing tools rely as much on software as on precision drill bits. The metalworking tools used to make airplanes and artillery pieces have complex computer control systems. It's technically possible not only to know where tools are but also what they're being used for.
The United States needs key manufacturing allies like Japan and Germany to present a united front. After all, a Japanese-made tool was even seen in a news report inside a Chinese nuclear research facility. The Biden administration should push to internationalize these tougher regulations with key allies in Europe and Asia.
Making more demands on companies would be far from unprecedented. The Treasury Department has hit banks with billion-dollar fines for facilitating money transfers to terrorist groups and drug cartels. Facing big penalties, banks invested in impressive compliance operations. As a first line of defense, some banks today don't allow the use of VPNs on their websites precisely so they can geolocate requests and prevent transactions in sanctioned countries. It's not a big leap to demand that Western toolmakers implement similar controls.
During the Cold War, the West imposed expansive controls on metalworking tools to prevent them from being used for Soviet military purposes. Getting serious about machinery export controls today is one of the most cost-effective ways to meaningfully limit our adversaries' militaries. Facing a revanchist Russia and adversarial China, we need to revitalize these techniques, or else our tools will continue to be used to build their militaries.

Seeking a Big Edge in AI, South Korean Firms Think Smaller

SEOUL, South Korea — ChatGPT, Bard, Claude. The world’s most popular and successful chatbots are trained on data scraped from vast swaths of the internet, mirroring the cultural and linguistic dominance of the English language and Western perspectives. This has raised alarms about the lack of diversity in artificial intelligence. There is also the worry that the technology will remain the province of a handful of American companies.
In South Korea, a technological powerhouse, firms are taking advantage of the technology’s malleability to shape AI systems from the ground up to address local needs. Some have trained AI models with sets of data rich in Korean language and culture. South Korean companies say they’re building AI for Thai, Vietnamese and Malaysian audiences. Others are eyeing customers in Brazil, Saudi Arabia and the Philippines, and in industries like medicine and pharmacy.
This has fueled hopes that AI can become more diverse, work in more languages, be customized to more cultures and be developed by more countries.
“The more competition is out there, the more systems are going to be robust: socially acceptable, safer, more ethical,” said Byong-Tak Zhang, a computer science professor at Seoul National University.
While there are some prominent non-American AI companies, such as France’s Mistral, the recent upheaval at OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, has highlighted how concentrated the industry remains.
The emerging AI landscape in South Korea is one of the most competitive and diverse in the world, said Yong Lim, a professor of law at Seoul National University who leads its AI Policy Initiative. The country’s export-driven economy has encouraged new ventures to seek ways to tailor AI systems to specific companies or countries.
South Korea is well positioned to build AI technology, developers say, given it has one of the world’s most wired populations to generate vast amounts of data to train AI systems. Its tech giants have the resources to invest heavily in research. The government has also been encouraging: It has provided companies with money and data that could be used to train large language models, the technology that powers AI chatbots.
Few other countries have the combination of capital and technology required to develop a large language model that can power a chatbot, experts say. They estimate that it costs $100 million to $200 million to build a foundational model, the technology that serves as the basis for AI chatbots.
South Korea is still months behind the U.S. in the AI race and may never fully catch up, as the leading chatbots continue to improve with more resources and data.
But South Korean companies believe they can compete. Instead of going after the global market like their U.S. competitors, companies like Naver and LG have tried to target their AI models to specific industries, cultures or languages instead of pulling from the entire internet.
“The localized strategy is a reasonable strategy for them,” said Sukwoong Choi, a professor of information systems at the University at Albany. “U.S. firms are focused on general-purpose tools. South Korean AI firms can target a specific area.”
Outside the U.S., AI prowess appears limited in reach. In China, Baidu’s answer to ChatGPT, called Ernie, and Huawei’s large language model have shown some success at home, but they are far from dominating the global market. Governments and companies in other nations like Canada, Britain, India and Israel have also said they are developing their own AI systems, though none has yet to release a system that can be used by the public.
About a year before ChatGPT was released, Naver, which operates South Korea’s most widely used search engine, announced that it had successfully created a large language model. But the chatbot based on that model, Clova X, was released only this September, nearly a year after ChatGPT’s debut.
Nako Sung, an executive at Naver who has led the company’s generative AI project, said the timing of ChatGPT’s release surprised him.
“Up until that point, we were taking a conservative approach to AI services and just cautiously exploring the possibilities,” Sung said. “Then we realized that the timeline had been accelerated a lot,” he added. “We decided we had to move immediately.”
Now, Naver runs an AI model built for Korean language speakers from the ground up using public data from the South Korean government and from its search engine, which has scraped the country’s internet since 1999.
Clova X recognizes Korean idioms and the latest slang — language that U.S.-made chatbots like Bard, ChatGPT and Claude often struggle to understand. Naver’s chatbot is also integrated into the search engine, letting people use the tool to shop and travel.
Outside its home market, the company is exploring business opportunities with the Saudi Arabian government. Japan could be another potential customer, experts said, since Line, a messaging service owned by Naver, is used widely there.
LG has also created its own generative AI model, the type of artificial intelligence capable of creating original content based on inputs, called Exaone. Since its creation in 2021, LG has worked with publishers, research centers, pharmaceutical firms and medical companies to tailor its system to their data sets and provide them access to its AI system.
The company is targeting businesses and researchers instead of the general user, said Kyunghoon Bae, the director of LG AI Research. Its subsidiaries have also begun using its own AI chatbots. One of the chatbots, built to analyze chemistry research and chemical equations, has been used by researchers building new materials for batteries, chemicals and medicine.
“Rather than letting the best one or two AI systems dominate, it’s important to have an array of models specific to a domain, language or culture,” said Honglak Lee, the chief scientist of LG’s AI research arm.
Another South Korean behemoth, Samsung, last month announced Samsung Gauss, a generative AI model being used internally to compose emails, summarize documents and translate text. The company plans to integrate it into its mobile phones and smart home appliances.
Other major companies have also said they are developing their own large language models, making South Korea one of the few countries with so many companies building AI systems. KT, a South Korean telecommunications firm, has said it is working with a Thai counterpart, Jasmine Group, on a large language model specialized in the Thai language. Kakao, which makes an eponymous super app for chats, has said it is developing generative AI for Korean, English, Japanese, Vietnamese and Malaysian.
Still, the United States’ dominance in AI appears secure for now. It remains to be seen how closely countries can catch up.
“The market is convulsing; it’s very difficult to predict what’s going to happen,” Lim said. “It’s the Wild West, in a sense.”

Chinese Videos Use A.I. to Tarnish U.S., Report Finds: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Content from at least 30 channels in the network drew nearly 120 million views and 730,000 subscribers since last year.
In a faintly stilted tone and with slightly awkward grammar, the American-accented voice on YouTube last month ridiculed Washington's handling of the war between Israel and Hamas, claiming that the United States was unable to "play its role as a mediator like China" and "now finds itself in a position of significant isolation."
The 10-minute post was one of more than 4,500 videos in an unusually large network of YouTube channels spreading pro-China and anti-U.S. narratives, according to a report this week from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a security-focused think tank.
Some of the videos used artificially generated avatars or voice-overs, making the campaign the first influence operation known to the institute to pair A.I. voices with video essays.
The campaign's goal, according to the report, was clear: to influence global opinion in favor of China and against the United States. The videos promoted narratives that Chinese technology was superior to America's, that the United States was doomed to economic collapse, and that China and Russia were responsible geopolitical players. Some of the clips fawned over Chinese companies like Huawei and denigrated American companies like Apple.
Content from at least 30 channels in the network drew nearly 120 million views and 730,000 subscribers since last year, along with occasional ads from Western companies, the report found.
Some of the videos featured titles and scripts that seemed to be direct translations of common Chinese phrases and the names of Chinese companies, the report said. Others mentioned information that could be traced to news stories that were produced and circulated primarily in mainland China.
Disinformation -- such as the false claim that some Southeast Asian nations had adopted the Chinese yuan as their own currency -- was common. The videos were often able to quickly react to current events. Jacinta Keast, an analyst at the Australian institute, wrote that the coordinated campaign might be "one of the most successful influence operations related to China ever witnessed on social media."
YouTube said in a statement that its teams work around the clock to protect its community, adding that "we have invested heavily in robust systems to proactively detect coordinated influence operations." The company said it welcomed research efforts and that it had shut down several of the channels mentioned in the report for violating the platform's policies.
Efforts to push pro-China messaging have proliferated in recent years, but have featured largely low-quality content that attracted limited engagement or failed to sustain meaningful audiences, Ms. Keast said.
"This campaign actually leverages artificial intelligence, which gives it the ability to create persuasive threat content at scale at a very limited cost compared to previous campaigns we've seen," she said.
Several other recent reports have suggested that China has become more aggressive in pressing propaganda denigrating the United States. Historically, its influence operations have focused on defending the Communist Party government and its policies on issues like the persecution of Uyghurs or the fate of Taiwan.
China began targeting the United States more directly amid the mass pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong in 2019 and continuing with the Covid-19 pandemic, echoing longstanding Russian efforts to discredit American leadership and influence at home and aboard.
Over the summer, researchers at Microsoft and other companies unearthed evidence of inauthentic accounts that China employed to falsely accuse the United States of using energy weapons to ignite the deadly wildfires in Hawaii in August.
In a report in September, the State Department accused China of using "deceptive and coercive methods" to shape the global information environment, including the creation of fake social media accounts and even fake news organizations. Other research suggests that China has actively spread disinformation in Taiwan that the United States will eventually betray the island nation.
Meta announced last month that it removed 4,789 Facebook accounts from China that were impersonating Americans to debate political issues, warning that the campaign appeared to be laying the groundwork for interference in the 2024 presidential elections. It was the fifth network with ties to China that Meta had detected this year, the most of any other country.
The advent of artificial technology seems to have drawn special interest from Beijing. Ms. Keast of the Australian institute said that disinformation peddlers were increasingly using easily accessible video editing and A.I. programs to create large volumes of convincing content.
She said that the network of pro-China YouTube channels most likely fed English-language scripts into readily available online text-to-video software or other programs that require no technical expertise and can produce clips within minutes. Such programs often allow users to select A.I.-generated voice narration and customize the gender, accent and tone of voice.
Some of the voices used in the pro-China network were clearly synthetic. Ms. Keast noted that the audio lacked natural pauses and included pronunciation mistakes and occasional notes of electronic interference. Occasionally, multiple channels in the network used the same voice. (One group of videos, however, tried to dupe viewers into thinking a real person was speaking, incorporating audio such as "I'm your host, Steffan.")
In 39 of the videos, Ms. Keast found at least 10 artificially generated avatars advertised by a British A.I. company. She wrote that she also discovered what may be the first example in an influence operation of a digital avatar created by a Chinese company -- a woman in a red dress named Yanni.
The scale of the pro-China network is probably even larger, according to the report. Similar channels appeared to target Indonesian and French people. Three separate channels posted videos about chip production that used similar thumbnail images and the same title translated into English, French and Spanish.

Debt Is a Global Quandary. Old Remedies Are in Doubt.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Economists offer alternatives to financial safeguards created when the U.S. was the pre-eminent superpower and climate change wasn't on the agenda.
Martin Guzman was a college freshman at La Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentina, in 2001 when a debt crisis prompted default, riots and a devastating depression. A dazed middle class suffered ruin, as the International Monetary Fund insisted that the government make misery-inducing budget cuts in exchange for a bailout.
Watching Argentina unravel inspired Mr. Guzman to switch majors and study economics. Nearly two decades later, when the government was again bankrupt, it was Mr. Guzman as finance minister who negotiated with I.M.F. officials to restructure a $ 44 billion debt, the result of an earlier ill-conceived bailout.
Today he is one of a number of prominent economists and world leaders who argue that the ambitious framework created at the end of World War II to safeguard economic growth and stability, with the I.M.F. and World Bank as its pillars, is failing in its mission.
The current system "contributes to a more inequitable and unstable global economy," said Mr. Guzman, who resigned last year after a rift within the government.
The repayment that Mr. Guzman negotiated was the 22nd arrangement between Argentina and the I.M.F. Even so, the country's economic tailspin has only increased with an annual inflation rate of more than 140 percent, growing lines at soup kitchens and a new, self-proclaimed "anarcho-capitalist" president, Javier Milei, who this week devalued the currency by 50 percent.
The I.M.F. and World Bank have aroused complaints from the left and right ever since they were created. But the latest critiques pose a more profound question: Does the economic framework devised eight decades ago fit the economy that exists today, when new geopolitical conflicts collide with established economic relationships and climate change poses an imminent threat?
This 21st-century clash of ideas about how to fix a system created for a 20th-century world is one of the most consequential facing the global economy.
The I.M.F. was set up in 1944 at a conference in Bretton Woods, N.H., to help rescue countries in financial distress, while the World Bank's focus was reducing poverty and investing in social development. The United States was the pre-eminent economic superpower, and scores of developing nations in Africa and Asia had not yet gained independence. The foundational ideology -- later known as the "Washington Consensus" -- held that prosperity depended on unhindered trade, deregulation and the primacy of private investment.
"Nearly 80 years later, the global financial architecture is outdated, dysfunctional and unjust," António Guterres, secretary general of the United Nations, said this summer at a summit in Paris. "Even the most fundamental goals on hunger and poverty have gone into reverse after decades of progress."
The world today is geopolitically fragmented. More than three-quarters of the current I.M.F. and World Bank countries were not at Bretton Woods. China's economy, in ruins at the end of World War II, is now the world's second largest, an engine of global growth and a crucial hub in the world's industrial machine and supply chain. India, then still a British colony, is one of the top five economies in the world.
The once vaunted "Washington Consensus" has fallen into disrepute, with a greater recognition of how inequality and bias against women hamper growth, as well as the need for collective action on the climate.
The mismatch between institution and mission has sharpened in recent years. Pounded by the Covid-19 pandemic, spiking food and energy prices related to the war in Ukraine, and higher interest rates, low- and middle-income countries are swimming in debt and facing slow growth. The size of the global economy as well as the scope of the problems has grown immensely, but funding of the I.M.F. and World Bank has not kept pace.
Resolving debt crises is also vastly more complicated now that China and legions of private creditors are involved, instead of just a handful of Western banks.
The World's Bank's own analyses outline the extent of the economic problems. "For the poorest countries, debt has become a nearly paralyzing burden," a report released Wednesday concluded. Countries are forced to spend money on interest payments instead of investing in public health, education and the environment.
And that debt doesn't account for the trillions of dollars that developing countries will need to mitigate the ravages of climate change.
Then there are the tensions between the United States and China, and Russia and Europe and its allies. It is harder to resolve debt crises or finance major infrastructure without bumping up against security concerns -- like when the World Bank awarded the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei a contract that turned out to violate U.S. sanctions policy, or when China has resisted debt restructuring agreements.
"The global rules-based system was not built to resolve national security-based trade conflicts," Gita Gopinath, first deputy managing director of the I.M.F., said Monday in a speech to the International Economic Association in Colombia. "We have countries strategically competing with amorphous rules and without an effective referee."
The World Bank and I.M.F. have made changes. The fund has moderated its approach to bailouts, replacing austerity with the idea of sustainable debt. The bank this year significantly increased the share of money going to climate-related projects. But critics maintain that the fixes so far are insufficient.
"The way in which they have evolved and adapted is much slower than the way the global economy evolved and adapted," Mr. Guzman said.
'Time to Revisit Bretton Woods'
Argentina, South America's second-largest economy, may be the global economic system's most notorious repeat failure, but it was Barbados, a tiny island nation in the Caribbean, that can be credited with turbocharging momentum for change.
Mia Mottley, the prime minister, spoke out two years ago at the climate change summit in Glasgow and then followed up with the Bridgetown Initiative, a proposal to overhaul the way rich countries help poor countries adapt to climate change and avoid crippling debt.
"Yes, it is time for us to revisit Bretton Woods," she said in a speech at last year's climate summit in Egypt.
Ms. Mottley argues that there has been a "fundamental breakdown" in a longstanding covenant between poor countries and rich ones, many of which built their wealth by exploiting former colonies. The most advanced industrialized countries also produce most of the emissions that are heating the planet and causing extreme floods, wildfires and droughts in poor countries.
Mavis Owusu-Gyamfi, the executive vice president of the African Center for Economic Transformation, in Ghana, said that even recent agreements to deal with debt like the 2020 Common Framework were created without input from developing nations.
"We are calling for a voice and seat at the table," Ms. Owusu-Gyamfi said, from her office in Accra, as she discussed a $ 3 billion I.M.F. bailout of Ghana.
Yet if the fund and bank are focused on economic issues, they are essentially political creations that reflect the power of the countries that established, finance and manage them.
And those countries are reluctant to cede that power. The United States, the only member with veto power, has the largest share of votes in part because of the size of its economy and financial contributions. It does not want to see its influence shrink and others' -- particularly China's -- grow.
The impasse over reapportioning votes has hampered efforts to increase funding levels, which countries across the board agree need to be increased.
'Big Hole' in How to Deal With Debt
Still, as Mr. Guzman said, "even if there are no changes in governance, there could be changes in policies."
Emerging nations need enormous amounts of money to invest in public health, education, transport and climate resilience. But they are saddled with high borrowing costs because of the market's often exaggerated perception of the risk they pose as borrowers.
And because they are usually compelled to borrow in dollars or euros, their payments soar if the Federal Reserve and other central banks raise interest rates to combat inflation as they did in the 1980s and after the Covid pandemic.
The proliferation of private lenders and variety of loan agreements have made debt negotiations impossibly complex, yet no international legal arbiter exists.
Zambia defaulted on its external debt three years ago, and there is still no agreement because the I.M.F., China and bondholders are at odds.
There's a "big hole" in international governance when it comes to sovereign debt, said Paola Subacchi, an economist at the Global Policy Institute at Queen Mary University in London, because the rules don't apply to private loans, whether from a hedge fund or China's central bank. Often these creditors have an interest in drawing out the process to hold out for a better deal.
Mr. Guzman and other economists have called for an international legal arbiter to adjudicate disputes related to sovereign debt.
"Every country has adopted a bankruptcy law," said Joseph Stiglitz, a former chief economist at the World Bank, "but internationally we don't have one."
The United States, though, has repeatedly opposed the idea, saying it is unnecessary.
Rescues, too, have proved to be problematic. Last-resort loans from the I.M.F. can end up adding to a country's budgetary woes and undermining the economic recovery because interest rates are so high now, and borrowers must also pay hefty fees.
Those like Mr. Guzman and Ms. Mottley pushing for change argue that indebted countries need significantly more grants and low-interest loans with long repayment timelines, along with a slate of other reforms.
"The challenges are different today," said Mr. Guzman. "Policies need to be better aligned with the mission."

G.O.P. Foes Claim Biden Gives China Edge in Tech: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Republican legislators argue that the Biden administration has been ill-equipped and unmotivated in a technology fight with Beijing.
Republican lawmakers are faulting the Biden administration's enforcement of restrictions on China's access to American technology, saying that the administration is still allowing semiconductors and other American innovation to flow to Beijing that could ultimately aid China in a military conflict.
In a report released on Thursday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee said the administration had failed to enforce export controls that limit sales of advanced technology to China. The federal government has been steadily ramping up limits on sales to China of advanced chips and chip-making equipment over the past few years. The United States has also placed restrictions on Chinese companies or organizations accused of aiding the Chinese military or Russia's war effort, or participating in human rights abuses in Xinjiang.
But Republican lawmakers said the administration had not done enough to enforce the rules and criticized the office in charge of policing export controls. The report faulted the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security for being too close to the technology industries it regulates. Many tech companies sell products and services to China and have pushed for more lenient rules in order to retain access to a large and growing market.
In particular, the report said the administration had granted too many special licenses allowing American companies to export restricted products to China, in some cases issuing those exemptions over the objections of defense and intelligence officials.
In a statement, a spokesman for the Bureau of Industry and Security said that the Biden administration had been thoughtful and vigorous in expanding the restrictions, and had added more than 1,100 parties to a restricted trade list, including more than 300 firms and organizations in China.
The spokesman said that the department was constantly assessing and updating its export controls, and looked forward to reviewing the report and working with members of Congress to achieve national security objectives.
Semiconductor companies have pushed back against the restrictions, saying that overly broad controls could push China to develop its own technologies and ultimately undercut American industry leadership.
Gina Raimondo, the secretary of commerce, said at a defense forum on Saturday that the administration was "building a more muscular Commerce Department" to take on China, including issuing "historic controls" that for the first time denied an entire country specific technologies.
But she argued that her department was badly in need of funding to complete that mission. The Bureau of Industry and Security "has the same budget today as it did a decade ago. We have twice as many licensing requests. I get calls from members of Congress, Democrat and Republican, constantly: 'Why aren't you doing more?"' Ms. Raimondo said.
"I agree with you. I have a $ 200 million budget. It's like the cost of a few fighter jets," she added. "Fund this operation like it needs to be funded so we can do what we need to do to protect America."
But several Republican lawmakers said Tuesday that they would withhold funding increases until the department changed its practices and moved forward with additional sanctions on Chinese companies like telecom giant Huawei. They cited government data showing that the agency had approved the sale of $ 60 billion in U.S. technology to Huawei over a six-month period in 2020 and 2021.
"Any conversation about additional resources must be matched with actions that demonstrate B.I.S. is being reformed into a true national security agency that will do what needs to be done to counter China and other adversaries," Representative Michael McCaul, chairman of House Foreign Affairs Committee, and two other Republican lawmakers said in a statement.
The congressional report recommended a series of overhauls, including giving Defense Department officials a greater say in the approval of special licenses to supply technology to China.
A House aide said the committee would begin working to craft legislation as early as next week, and to seek bipartisan support for the changes. The committee will hold a hearing next Tuesday with Biden administration officials who oversee export controls.
The Biden administration recently restricted the export to China of an entire category of cutting-edge semiconductors used to create artificial intelligence, as well as the equipment to manufacture those chips. The administration also extended its rules extraterritorially, regulating products that use American technology but are manufactured outside the United States.
Officials with the Bureau of Industry and Security have said they work closely with other government officials to carefully review licenses for sales to China. In 2022, the bureau and its other agency partners reviewed more than 5,000 applications for exports to China, about a quarter of which were not approved, officials said.
But critics say Biden officials have not gone far enough to restrain some of China's most advanced firms, like Huawei or the server maker Inspur.
Over the past year, the Biden administration considered clamping down on the special licenses that have allowed American companies to continue supplying certain goods to Huawei, but paused the effort this spring as it worked to mend ties with the Chinese government, according to people familiar with the matter.
Some China critics also expressed outrage last month when the Biden administration rolled back a trade restriction on a Chinese institution accused of aiding human rights abuses in Xinjiang. The Chinese government had complained that the restrictions were an impediment to cooperation between the governments on restricting fentanyl.
In a briefing in November, a state department official said that the administration had decided that removing the restrictions was an appropriate step to secure an agreement on fentanyl that could save thousands of American lives.
The fight over the Bureau of Industry and Security, formerly a relatively obscure agency, has grown more intense as its responsibilities have escalated in recent years, to include keeping American technology from reaching adversaries in China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.
Gregory Allen, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that, in comparison to the capacity of other governments, the bureau's abilities were impressive. But the demands on the bureau had exploded after Russia invaded Ukraine and the Biden administration placed controls on China.
The bureau was understaffed, and its technology and databases were outdated, Mr. Allen said.
"From my perspective, that's unacceptable," he said. "The United States has put export controls at the heart of technology and national security policy. We need that capacity to be incredibly robust."

A.I. Firm's Ties To China Rattle Top U.S. Spies: [Foreign Desk]

Author: Mazzetti, Mark; Wong, Edward

Publication info: Mazzetti, Mark; Wong, Edward.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When the secretive national security adviser of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed, visited the White House in June, his American counterpart, Jake Sullivan, raised a delicate issue: G42, an artificial intelligence firm controlled by the sheikh that American officials believe is hiding the extent of its work with China.
In public, the company has announced its staggering growth with a steady cadence of news releases. They have included agreements with European pharmaceutical giants like AstraZeneca and a $ 100 million deal with a Silicon Valley firm to build what the companies boast will be the "world's largest supercomputer." Last month, G42 announced a partnership with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT.
But in classified American intelligence channels, there have been more concerning reports about the company. The C.I.A. and other American spy agencies have issued warnings about G42's work with large Chinese companies that U.S. officials consider security threats, including Huawei, the telecommunications giant that is under U.S. sanctions.
U.S. officials fear G42 could be a conduit by which advanced American technology is siphoned to Chinese companies or the government. The intelligence reports have also warned that G42's dealings with Chinese firms could be a pipeline to get the genetic data of millions of Americans and others into the hands of the Chinese government, according to two officials familiar with the reports.
The C.I.A. even produced a classified profile of Peng Xiao, the chief executive of G42 who was educated in the United States and renounced his American citizenship for an Emirati one, U.S. officials say. The conclusions of the C.I.A. document about Mr. Xiao are unclear.
During the White House meeting in June with Sheikh Tahnoon and in other discussions of the past year, the Biden administration raised concerns about the company's leadership and pushed for G42 to sever ties with Chinese companies and any agencies, according to a dozen people familiar with the discussions. The Americans have even pointed to the prospect of sanctions against the Emirati firm. The Biden administration's concerns about G42 and its pressure campaign with the Emirates are being reported here for the first time.
On sensitive emerging technologies, the Emirates must choose between the United States and China, American officials have told their Emirati counterparts.
For years, the United States has been trying to limit China's influence in the Middle East, and American officials believe Chinese efforts to build military bases and sell weapons in the region are urgent national security concerns. Today, however, there is a new frontier in this effort: blunting China's ambitions to gain supremacy in the world's cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence, big data, quantum computing, cloud computing, surveillance infrastructure and genomic research.
G42 is at the center of this fight.
U.S. officials are watching for signs of progress but decline to discuss details of the talks, which have involved the White House and various agencies. They have taken place over months in Washington and in Abu Dhabi, the Emirati capital where both William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo have discussed the matter with the Emiratis during different trips this year. Tarun Chhabra, the National Security Council's senior director for technology, has also raised concerns with officials in Abu Dhabi.
This article is based on interviews with American government officials, tech analysts and American and foreign business executives, some of whom agreed to speak only on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive diplomacy over G42.
The company is a crown jewel for the U.A.E., which is building an artificial intelligence industry as an alternative to oil income. The small but powerful Middle Eastern country, led by its president, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, is also cultivating closer ties to China and Russia, in part to lessen its dependence on the United States, the main military partner and arms supplier of the Emirates.
As of now, it is unclear whether U.S. officials have shared their concerns over G42 with American companies that have partnerships with it.
The American efforts to scrutinize and restrict the activities of G42 are emblematic of the murky world in which U.S. spy agencies operate in their broader espionage shadow war with China. As the superpower rivalry intensifies, U.S. policymakers are relying on intelligence collection and analysis to help head off China's efforts to make technological advances that would erode America's military edge.
Companies in almost every sector around the globe have ties to China, the world's second-largest economy. And the U.S. efforts to put G42 under a microscope show how difficult it is for intelligence agencies to discern whether a foreign company with commercial ties to China has links to that country's military or its security and intelligence agencies.
In some cases, a partnership between a foreign company and a Chinese firm that is considered a favorite of the government or Communist Party -- Huawei, for instance -- is enough to set off alarms in Washington. Those relations are often opaque when they involve companies working in advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence that have both civilian and military uses.
In the case of G42, the C.I.A. and other government departments have investigated the ties between G42 and Chinese companies and officials. They have flagged some specific areas of concern -- pointing out, for instance, that G42's "stack," or its underlying technology infrastructure, has been built with the help of Chinese companies, including Huawei. Intelligence agencies have scrutinized a subsidiary of G42 called Presight AI, U.S. officials said. The company sells surveillance technology to police forces worldwide, including software nearly identical to products popular with Chinese police.
Kathleen Waters, a deputy spokeswoman for the National Security Council, declined to address specific issues with G42. She called the Emirates an "important partner" but said White House officials have made clear to the Emiratis and others the administration's "strong concerns about the P.R.C. seeking military and intelligence advantages through the acquisition of sensitive U.S. technologies and data, which the Biden administration is determined to protect." (The P.R.C. is the People's Republic of China.)
"This will continue to be a focus of intensive engagement with the U.A.E. and many other countries, and we welcome progress to date," Ms. Waters added.
Yousef Al Otaiba, the Emirati ambassador in Washington, declined to comment.
G42 declined a request for an interview with Mr. Xiao, its chief executive, and did not answer questions about its partnerships with specific Chinese companies or about U.S. government concerns over those. In a statement to The New York Times, Talal Al Kaissi, a senior executive at the company, said the firm had worked "with various international technology players from around the world." He noted that it began discussions with Microsoft late last year to try to replace its technology stack or infrastructure. This year, he said, it decided to look to U.S. companies, including Cerebras and Nvidia, to upgrade a supercomputer and shift from its "legacy technology supplier, which included Chinese hardware."
The company ensures operations and licensed technologies "remain in full compliance" with U.S. government regulations and talks to U.S. agencies about staying aligned with those, he said. It is "partnering with leading companies and institutions with shared values and developing responsible A.I. solutions," he added.
'The Ultimate Question of Life'
G42's name is drawn from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," the science-fiction series by Douglas Adams, in which the number 42 represents the answer to "the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything." (The G stands for group.)
"Forty-two is really our mission," Mr. Xiao said in a promotional video for the company last year. "In that amazing book, 42 was the answer to the meaning of life."
Within that wide remit, G42 encompasses a $ 10 billion technology investment fund, an Arabic language A.I. model, a tech talent platform, a health care company, a genome-sequencing program and more. G42's investments overseas include a $ 100 million purchase early this year of shares in ByteDance, the Chinese company that is the parent of TikTok, the popular social media app, according to a Bloomberg News report.
In a promotional video, Mr. Xiao said he believed that the impact of artificial intelligence on human civilization would be "much more profound than fire, electricity or even internet."
In addition to collaborations with Chinese companies, G42 has also signed agreements with American companies including Microsoft and Dell Technologies.
Mr. Xiao has impressed some of his American partners.
"He's a visionary," said Andrew Feldman, the chief executive of Cerebras, the Silicon Valley A.I. firm that is partnering with G42 on the supercomputer project. "He's knowledgeable and thoughtful. I found somebody with a shared vision,"
Besides its work with G42, Cerebras has several U.S. government contracts, including with the Air Force Research Laboratory and the Department of Energy, according to public records and Mr. Feldman.
Mr. Feldman said he was surprised to hear about the Biden administration's concerns about G42 and said that no American officials have raised those concerns with him or other officers at Cerebras.
OpenAI and Microsoft declined to comment, and Dell said, "We comply with global regulations and have nothing additional to add."
Social Media and Genetic Data
Sheikh Tahnoon, the company's sunglasses-obsessed chairman, is one of the Emirates' most powerful men. Even in a state where senior officials often hold multiple posts, Sheikh Tahnoon, a brother of the Emirati president, stands out. In addition to overseeing a secretive conglomerate called the "International Holding Company" -- the country's most valuable listed firm -- Sheikh Tahnoon is also the deputy ruler of the emirate of Abu Dhabi and head of an $ 853 billion sovereign wealth fund. (Another family-run sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala, has a stake in G42.)
Mr. Xiao has been a part of Sheikh Tahnoon's ventures for some time, and several of the past partnerships have set off alarms within American spy agencies.
There is very little about Mr. Xiao's background online, which is rare for a chief executive of a prominent company. His LinkedIn page and corporate profiles say he earned bachelor's degrees at Hawaii Pacific University and a master's degree at George Washington University in the 1990s, but there is no information on his years before college.
His LinkedIn account says he worked from 1999 to 2014 as a chief technology officer for MicroStrategy, a technology company in Virginia. He has rarely given individual interviews to journalists but has done some public talks. An online post by China's embassy in the Emirates that mentions him uses the Chinese name 肖鹏.
Four years ago, a firm led by Mr. Xiao had a hand in the operation of a social media app, ToTok, that American intelligence agencies identified as a spy tool that the Emirati government was using to track the movements and conversations of its users. Chinese engineers helped create the app.
The data harvested from the app, according to a 2019 American intelligence assessment, was stored by an Emirati firm called Pax AI, which Mr. Xiao ran.
Bill Marczak of Citizen Lab, a digital watchdog group at the University of Toronto, has researched the constellation of companies controlled by Sheikh Tahnoon, and called them "master classes in blending state power and business."
"Because ToTok worked so well, its popularity took off among Emiratis and their contacts abroad," Mr. Marczak said. "And since the app's encryption didn't prevent Group 42 from accessing ToTok users' conversations, the app could have fed a huge volume of juicy data back to U.A.E. intelligence."
Mr. Marczak said that G42 "seems to have absorbed assets and personnel from Chinese chat app YeeCall in order to create ToTok." After a New York Times investigation into ToTok in 2019, company representatives denied that it had been built to be a spy tool.
At the start of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, G42 partnered with a Chinese biotech firm, BGI Genomics, to distribute its Covid-19 tests, and the Emirati government donated tens of thousands of the tests to the State of Nevada. American officials warned Nevada officials not to distribute the tests out of concern that the operation could be a secret ploy by the Chinese government to gather genetic information about Americans from the tests, The Associated Press reported.
In March, the Biden administration put subsidiaries of BGI on a Commerce Department blacklist and said that collection and analysis of genetic data done by the companies "poses a significant risk of contributing to monitoring and surveillance by the government of China."
In June 2020, Mr. Xiao and Emirati leaders announced that G42 was partnering with Sinopharm, the Chinese drug giant, to do Phase 3 of clinical trials for a Covid-19 vaccine. That trial expanded to other nations in the region, including Bahrain, whose crown prince spoke by video with Mr. Xiao and the chairman of Sinopharm, according to an online post by China's embassy in Bahrain.
In March 2021, Wang Yi, China's foreign minister, announced on a visit to the Emirates that G42 and Sinopharm would produce the vaccine in Abu Dhabi.
One of Mr. Xiao's previous ventures, Pegasus, signed an agreement in 2017 with Huawei to develop surveillance technologies for police forces. That company was owned by DarkMatter, a cyber-intelligence and hacking firm that employs former spies. It had no relation to the notorious spyware also called Pegasus that was developed by NSO Group, an Israeli firm.
Charging Into the Middle East
The Chinese government has made no secret of its intentions to expand the country's economic and military footprint in the Middle East. The deepening ties between China and the U.A.E. have been a cause for particular alarm for American officials.
The Emirates regularly purchases billions of dollars worth of American military equipment, but the country has also shown eagerness to buy Chinese military hardware.
The Trump administration cultivated close ties to Emirati leaders, but national security officials were wary of the U.A.E.'s growing ties to China. Several officials disliked the fact that Huawei was providing main elements of the country's technology infrastructure. That issue became more contentious after the United States agreed in 2020 to sell advanced F-35 fighter jets to the Emirates as an incentive to get the country to normalize ties with Israel.
American officials try to ensure technology around those jets does not fall into the hands of adversaries. Around this time, U.S. agencies began looking more closely at Mr. Xiao and G42 because of its prominent role in technology in the Emirates. G42 opened an office in Israel after normalization.

Early in the Biden administration, American officials confronted Emirati officials with satellite images that they argued showed China was building a military base in the country. Since then, U.S. officials say, the Emirates has suspended the project. Emirati officials insist it was commercial port construction.
Still, C.I.A. officials have made regular trips to Abu Dhabi to present classified information to the Emirates that buttresses the Americans' concerns about security and technology ties between China and the U.A.E.
In June, just days after White House officials privately raised concerns about G42 to the Emirati national security chief, Mr. Xiao took the stage for a companywide town hall for G42's fifth anniversary.
At the event, which the company called "Supercharged," Mr. Xiao said the company was just getting started.

WASHINGTON — When the secretive national security adviser of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed, visited the White House in June, his American counterpart, Jake Sullivan, raised a delicate issue: G42, an artificial intelligence firm controlled by the sheikh that American officials believe is hiding the extent of its work with China.
In public, the company has announced its staggering growth with a steady cadence of news releases. They have included agreements with European pharmaceutical giants like AstraZeneca and a $100 million deal with a Silicon Valley firm to build what the companies boast will be the “world’s largest supercomputer.” Last month, G42 announced a partnership with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT.
But in classified American intelligence channels, there have been more concerning reports about the company. The CIA and other American spy agencies have issued warnings about G42’s work with large Chinese companies that U.S. officials consider security threats, including Huawei, the telecommunications giant that is under U.S. sanctions.
U.S. officials fear G42 could be a conduit by which advanced American technology is siphoned to Chinese companies or the government. The intelligence reports have also warned that G42’s dealings with Chinese firms could be a pipeline to get the genetic data of millions of Americans and others into the hands of the Chinese government, according to two officials familiar with the reports.
The CIA even produced a classified profile of Peng Xiao, the CEO of G42 who was educated in the United States and renounced his American citizenship for a UAE one, U.S. officials say. The conclusions of the CIA document about Xiao are unclear.
During the White House meeting in June with Sheikh Tahnoon and in other discussions of the past year, the Biden administration raised concerns about the company’s leadership and pushed for G42 to sever ties with Chinese companies and any agencies, according to a dozen people familiar with the discussions. The Americans have even pointed to the prospect of sanctions against the UAE firm. The Biden administration’s concerns about G42 and its pressure campaign with the Emirates are being reported here for the first time.
On sensitive emerging technologies, the Emirates must choose between the United States and China, American officials have told their UAE counterparts.
For years, the United States has been trying to limit China’s influence in the Middle East, and American officials believe Chinese efforts to build military bases and sell weapons in the region are urgent national security concerns. Today, however, there is a new frontier in this effort: blunting China’s ambitions to gain supremacy in the world’s cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence, big data, quantum computing, cloud computing, surveillance infrastructure and genomic research.
G42 is at the center of this fight.
U.S. officials are watching for signs of progress but decline to discuss details of the talks, which have involved the White House and various agencies. They have taken place over months in Washington and in Abu Dhabi, the UAE capital where both William J. Burns, the CIA director, and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo have discussed the matter with the Emiratis during different trips this year. Tarun Chhabra, the National Security Council’s senior director for technology, has also raised concerns with officials in Abu Dhabi.
This article is based on interviews with American government officials, tech analysts and American and foreign business executives, some of whom agreed to speak only on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive diplomacy over G42.
The company is a crown jewel for the UAE, which is building an artificial intelligence industry as an alternative to oil income. The small but powerful Middle Eastern country, led by its president, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, is also cultivating closer ties to China and Russia, in part to lessen its dependence on the United States, the main military partner and arms supplier of the UAE.
As of now, it is unclear whether U.S. officials have shared their concerns over G42 with American companies that have partnerships with it.
The American efforts to scrutinize and restrict the activities of G42 are emblematic of the murky world in which U.S. spy agencies operate in their broader espionage shadow war with China. As the superpower rivalry intensifies, U.S. policymakers are relying on intelligence collection and analysis to help head off China’s efforts to make technological advances that would erode America’s military edge.
Companies in almost every sector around the globe have ties to China, the world’s second-largest economy. And the U.S. efforts to put G42 under a microscope show how difficult it is for intelligence agencies to discern whether a foreign company with commercial ties to China has links to that country’s military or its security and intelligence agencies.
In some cases, a partnership between a foreign company and a Chinese firm that is considered a favorite of the government or Communist Party — Huawei, for instance — is enough to set off alarms in Washington. Those relations are often opaque when they involve companies working in advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence that have both civilian and military uses.
In the case of G42, the CIA and other government departments have investigated the ties between G42 and Chinese companies and officials. They have flagged some specific areas of concern — pointing out, for instance, that G42’s “stack,” or its underlying technology infrastructure, has been built with the help of Chinese companies, including Huawei. Intelligence agencies have scrutinized a subsidiary of G42 called Presight AI, U.S. officials said. The company sells surveillance technology to police forces worldwide, including software nearly identical to products popular with Chinese police.
Kathleen Waters, a deputy spokesperson for the National Security Council, declined to address specific issues with G42. She called the UAE an “important partner” but said White House officials have made clear to the UAE and others the administration’s “strong concerns about the PRC seeking military and intelligence advantages through the acquisition of sensitive U.S. technologies and data, which the Biden administration is determined to protect.” (The PRC is the People’s Republic of China.)
“This will continue to be a focus of intensive engagement with the UAE and many other countries, and we welcome progress to date,” Waters added.
Yousef Al Otaiba, the UAE ambassador in Washington, declined to comment.
G42 declined a request for an interview with Xiao, its CEO, and did not answer questions about its partnerships with specific Chinese companies or about U.S. government concerns over those. In a statement to The New York Times, Talal Al Kaissi, a senior executive at the company, said the firm had worked “with various international technology players from around the world.” He noted that it began discussions with Microsoft late last year to try to replace its technology stack or infrastructure. This year, he said, it decided to look to U.S. companies, including Cerebras and Nvidia, to upgrade a supercomputer and shift from its “legacy technology supplier, which included Chinese hardware.”
The company ensures operations and licensed technologies “remain in full compliance” with U.S. government regulations and talks to U.S. agencies about staying aligned with those, he said. It is “partnering with leading companies and institutions with shared values and developing responsible AI solutions,” he added.
‘The Ultimate Question of Life’
G42’s name is drawn from “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,” the science-fiction series by Douglas Adams, in which the number 42 represents the answer to “the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything.” (The G stands for group.)
“Forty-two is really our mission,” Xiao said in a promotional video for the company last year. “In that amazing book, 42 was the answer to the meaning of life.”
Within that wide remit, G42 encompasses a $10 billion technology investment fund, an Arabic language AI model, a tech talent platform, a health care company, a genome-sequencing program and more. G42’s investments overseas include a $100 million purchase early this year of shares in ByteDance, the Chinese company that is the parent of TikTok, the popular social media app, according to a Bloomberg News report.
In a promotional video, Xiao said he believed that the impact of artificial intelligence on human civilization would be “much more profound than fire, electricity or even internet.”
In addition to collaborations with Chinese companies, G42 has also signed agreements with American companies including Microsoft and Dell Technologies.
Xiao has impressed some of his American partners.
“He’s a visionary,” said Andrew Feldman, the CEO of Cerebras, the Silicon Valley AI firm that is partnering with G42 on the supercomputer project. “He’s knowledgeable and thoughtful. I found somebody with a shared vision,”
Besides its work with G42, Cerebras has several U.S. government contracts, including with the Air Force Research Laboratory and the Department of Energy, according to public records and Feldman.
Feldman said he was surprised to hear about the Biden administration’s concerns about G42 and said that no American officials have raised those concerns with him or other officers at Cerebras.
OpenAI and Microsoft declined to comment, and Dell said, “We comply with global regulations and have nothing additional to add.”
Social Media and Genetic Data
Sheikh Tahnoon, the company’s sunglasses-obsessed chairperson, is one of the UAE’s most powerful men. Even in a state where senior officials often hold multiple posts, Sheikh Tahnoon, a brother of the UAE president, stands out. In addition to overseeing a secretive conglomerate called the “International Holding Company” — the country’s most valuable listed firm — Sheikh Tahnoon is also the deputy ruler of the emirate of Abu Dhabi and head of an $853 billion sovereign wealth fund. (Another family-run sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala, has a stake in G42.)
Xiao has been a part of Sheikh Tahnoon’s ventures for some time, and several of the past partnerships have set off alarms within American spy agencies.
There is very little about Xiao’s background online, which is rare for a CEO of a prominent company. His LinkedIn page and corporate profiles say he earned bachelor’s degrees at Hawaii Pacific University and a master’s degree at George Washington University in the 1990s, but there is no information on his years before college.
His LinkedIn account says he worked from 1999 to 2014 as a chief technology officer for MicroStrategy, a technology company in Virginia. He has rarely given individual interviews to journalists but has done some public talks.
Four years ago, a firm led by Xiao had a hand in the operation of a social media app, ToTok, that American intelligence agencies identified as a spy tool that the UAE government was using to track the movements and conversations of its users. Chinese engineers helped create the app.
The data harvested from the app, according to a 2019 American intelligence assessment, was stored by a UAE firm called Pax AI, which Xiao ran.
Bill Marczak of Citizen Lab, a digital watchdog group at the University of Toronto, has researched the constellation of companies controlled by Sheikh Tahnoon, and called them “master classes in blending state power and business.”
“Because ToTok worked so well, its popularity took off among Emiratis and their contacts abroad,” Marczak said. “And since the app’s encryption didn’t prevent Group 42 from accessing ToTok users’ conversations, the app could have fed a huge volume of juicy data back to UAE intelligence.”
Marczak said that G42 “seems to have absorbed assets and personnel from Chinese chat app YeeCall in order to create ToTok.” After a New York Times investigation into ToTok in 2019, company representatives denied that it had been built to be a spy tool.
At the start of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, G42 partnered with a Chinese biotech firm, BGI Genomics, to distribute its COVID-19 tests, and the UAE government donated tens of thousands of the tests to Nevada. American officials warned Nevada officials not to distribute the tests out of concern that the operation could be a secret ploy by the Chinese government to gather genetic information about Americans from the tests, The Associated Press reported.
In March, the Biden administration put subsidiaries of BGI on a Commerce Department blacklist and said that collection and analysis of genetic data done by the companies “poses a significant risk of contributing to monitoring and surveillance by the government of China.”
In June 2020, Xiao and UAE leaders announced that G42 was partnering with Sinopharm, the Chinese drug giant, to do Phase 3 of clinical trials for a COVID-19 vaccine. That trial expanded to other nations in the region, including Bahrain, whose crown prince spoke by video with Xiao and the chairperson of Sinopharm, according to an online post by China’s embassy in Bahrain.
In March 2021, Wang Yi, China’s foreign minister, announced on a visit to the UAE that G42 and Sinopharm would produce the vaccine in Abu Dhabi.
One of Xiao’s previous ventures, Pegasus, signed an agreement in 2017 with Huawei to develop surveillance technologies for police forces. That company was owned by DarkMatter, a cyber-intelligence and hacking firm that employs former spies. It had no relation to the notorious spyware also called Pegasus that was developed by NSO Group, an Israeli firm.
Charging Into the Middle East
The Chinese government has made no secret of its intentions to expand the country’s economic and military footprint in the Middle East. The deepening ties between China and the UAE have been a cause for particular alarm for American officials.
The UAE regularly purchases billions of dollars worth of American military equipment, but the country has also shown eagerness to buy Chinese military hardware.
The Trump administration cultivated close ties to UAE leaders, but national security officials were wary of the UAE’s growing ties to China. Several officials disliked the fact that Huawei was providing main elements of the country’s technology infrastructure. That issue became more contentious after the United States agreed in 2020 to sell advanced F-35 fighter jets to the UAE as an incentive to get the country to normalize ties with Israel.
American officials try to ensure technology around those jets does not fall into the hands of adversaries. Around this time, U.S. agencies began looking more closely at Xiao and G42 because of its prominent role in technology in the UAE. G42 opened an office in Israel after normalization. (The F-35 deal ultimately did not go through.)
Early in the Biden administration, American officials confronted UAE officials with satellite images that they argued showed China was building a military base in the country. Since then, U.S. officials say, the UAE has suspended the project. UAE officials insist it was commercial port construction.
Still, CIA officials have made regular trips to Abu Dhabi to present classified information to the UAE that buttresses the Americans’ concerns about security and technology ties between China and the UAE.
In June, just days after White House officials privately raised concerns about G42 to the UAE national security chief, Xiao took the stage for a companywide town hall for G42’s fifth anniversary.
At the event, which the company called “Supercharged,” Xiao said the company was just getting started.

China Wants To Bulldoze Its Way Out Of a Crisis: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The halting revitalization of one "urban village" in Shenzhen shows the challenges of fixing a national property crisis after years of overborrowing.
In Shenzhen, a metropolis born of China's economic prosperity, Paibang Village is a reminder of the city's modest past and the challenges ahead for reviving the country's property sector.
Paibang is what China calls an urban village, a labyrinth of low-slung apartment buildings and mom-and-pop storefronts connected by a maze of alleyways and narrow roads. There are hundreds of them in Shenzhen, a municipality of 18 million people next to Hong Kong, and thousands of such villages across China.
Now with China mired in an unyielding property crisis, policymakers want to revamp aging urban neighborhoods like Paibang to kick-start construction and spur local economies.
But as the halting rehabilitation of Paibang shows, it will not be a quick or easy fix.
Seven years ago, Paibang was chosen for an "urban renewal" by city officials, and in 2019 China Evergrande, one of the country's biggest real estate firms, took control of the project. The company paid building owners for the right to demolish apartments and start clearing land for modern high-rises. Before the work could begin, Evergrande collapsed.
Evergrande then handed the project to Shenzhen Metro, a state-owned firm and top shareholder in China Vanke, another giant homebuilder. Now Vanke is facing its own cash concerns. Last week, Shenzhen Metro -- and, by extension, the Shenzhen government -- sought to calm investors by pledging to backstop Vanke.
All the while, construction in Paibang has been at a standstill. On a recent weekday, a glass-enclosed modern building that serves as the project headquarters, and still displays Evergrande signs, was largely empty.
China's biggest homebuilders are in financial turmoil, suffering a sales slowdown and restrictions on borrowing after years of excess. Last month, the average price of new homes fell by the most in more than eight years. The real estate slump is weighing on the economy. Local governments, reliant on land lease revenue, are feeling the squeeze.
The government has tried cutting interest rates and loosening home-buying requirements but has not moved the needle. More drastic measures may weigh on local budgets when debt is already a problem. Financial regulators are discussing ways to support developers, but they are wary of inducing real estate firms to revert to the risky behavior that prompted the crisis.
And that's why Chinese leaders are looking at urban villages, community-owned enclaves within larger cities. All urban land in China is owned by the state. As part of the country's urbanization drive, the government expanded cities by absorbing bordering farmland held by villagers.
But villages were allowed to maintain collective ownership of the areas where their residents lived, creating pockets of land where the state's reach had limits. As Chinese cities modernized into expanses of high-rises and gridded streets, the urban villages grew into chaotic, densely populated neighborhoods little touched by the gentrification surrounding them.
Starting around 2009, as urban expansion started to run out of land, many local governments recognized the untapped potential of urban villages, and redeveloped neighborhoods. But it was mostly a local initiative until this year.
The Politburo, the Chinese Communist Party's executive policymaking body, said in April that it would "actively and steadily advance the transformation of urban villages" in the country's 21 largest cities. In July, China's cabinet, the State Council, called the policy an "important measure" to "expand domestic demand," according to Xinhua, the state news agency.
"It really shows that the Chinese leaders are feeling this anxiety to find new channels of urban growth," said Zhang Yue, an associate professor of political science at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
In the last major real estate downturn, around 2015, Beijing spent hundreds of billions of dollars to pay residents cash to trade in dilapidated shacks in smaller cities and towns.
Redeveloping urban villages is more complicated and could be just as costly.
In an October report, Nomura Securities said that the process was "challenging and expensive," and that the pace would be slow. The Chinese brokerage CITIC Securities estimated that China might invest nearly $ 140 billion annually for a full decade, according to an August report.
Paibang, in Shenzhen's northwestern region, is like many other urban villages. Rows of concrete apartment blocks stand so close to each other that they are colloquially known as "handshake buildings" to describe the proximity of the neighbors. The apartments are run-down: no elevators, bars on windows and squat toilets.
A lively shopping district is on street level -- fruit and vegetable stands, secondhand shops and simple eateries. In nearby industrial parks, there are printing shops, warehouses and factories. In Paibang and three neighboring villages, the vast majority of the 59,000 residents are migrants from elsewhere in China who have moved to Shenzhen for jobs.
These neighborhoods are often called the "starting point of a dream." The Chinese singer Chen Chusheng lived in an urban village in Shenzhen and performed in bars at night before he became famous. In a ballad he wrote about the experience, he sings: "People there were very close, and the distance between the buildings was just a crack."
Shenzhen was named China's first special economic zone in 1979, turning a fishing village of 300,000 people into the center of China's experimentation with capitalism. Shenzhen became the birthplace of many of its most successful companies, including Huawei, BYD and Tencent.
But as Shenzhen grew, migrant workers, still essential to the local labor force, were priced out of the city's newly developed neighborhoods.
In many villages, the land is held by a collective, and the buildings are owned by longtime villagers, many of whom moved out of the neighborhood a long time ago.
Gao Jia has run a secondhand furniture and electronics shop in Paibang for eight years. Last year, his landlords asked him to vacate after they agreed to hand over the building housing his store to Evergrande. He was delighted to win a reprieve after Evergrande's problems brought the redevelopment project to a halt and prevented his landlords from completing the building's sale.
"Renovating old towns does us no good at all," Mr. Gao said. "We won't be able to afford the rent, and we won't be able to do business anymore."
Duan Biqiong, a stationery shop owner, said, "If there are no migrant workers, this place is nothing but an empty town."
In addition to pricing out some residents, urban village renewals are time-consuming. Local governments must negotiate agreements from cooperatives that own land as well as individual building owners before knocking down structures.
Officials in Guangzhou, China's third-biggest city, with 127 urban village renovations underway this year, said the average completion time for a project had stretched from 5.5 years to more than seven years, according to local media. The longer a rehabilitation takes, the more it costs.
Jackle Zhuang, 44, owns a five-story apartment building in Paibang. When he first moved in with his family as a teenager, the neighborhood was barely developed. The nearest bus stop was a 30-minute walk away. Today, Paibang has its own subway stop.
But Mr. Zhuang doesn't live in the neighborhood anymore. He moved with his wife and child this year to Chengdu, a city in western China more than 1,000 miles away. In Paibang, he said, there were no parks nearby, and it wasn't safe for children because the buildings were so close to the road.
"There is probably nothing else good, apart from the cheap rent," Mr. Zhuang said. "It's not an ideal living environment."
While he is ready to move on, he is not sure if the deal he signed with Evergrande in 2020 to sell his building is still valid or whether he will need to negotiate again with the new developer. He is hoping to trade in his current apartments for units in a new building.
For now, all he can do is wait and see.

Now with China mired in an unyielding property crisis, policymakers want to revamp aging urban neighborhoods like Paibang to kick-start construction and spur local economies.
But as the halting rehabilitation of Paibang shows, it will not be a quick or easy fix.
Seven years ago, Paibang was chosen for an “urban renewal” by city officials, and in 2019 China Evergrande, one of the country’s biggest real estate firms, took control of the project. The company paid building owners for the right to demolish apartments and start clearing land for modern high-rises. Before the work could begin, Evergrande collapsed.
Evergrande then handed the project to Shenzhen Metro, a state-owned firm and top shareholder in China Vanke, another giant homebuilder. Now Vanke is facing its own cash concerns. This month, Shenzhen Metro — and, by extension, the Shenzhen government — sought to calm investors by pledging to backstop Vanke.
All the while, construction in Paibang has been at a standstill. On a recent weekday, a glass-enclosed modern building that serves as the project headquarters, and still displays Evergrande signs, was largely empty.
China’s biggest homebuilders are in financial turmoil, suffering a sales slowdown and restrictions on borrowing after years of excess. Last month, the average price of new homes fell by the most in more than eight years. The real estate slump is weighing on the economy. Local governments, reliant on land lease revenue, are feeling the squeeze.
The government has tried cutting interest rates and loosening homebuying requirements but has not moved the needle. More drastic measures may weigh on local budgets when debt is already a problem. Financial regulators are discussing ways to support developers, but they are wary of inducing real estate firms to revert to the risky behavior that prompted the crisis.
And that’s why Chinese leaders are looking at urban villages, community-owned enclaves within larger cities. All urban land in China is owned by the state. As part of the country’s urbanization drive, the government expanded cities by absorbing bordering farmland held by villagers.
But villages were allowed to maintain collective ownership of the areas where their residents lived, creating pockets of land where the state’s reach had limits. As Chinese cities modernized into expanses of high-rises and gridded streets, the urban villages grew into chaotic, densely populated neighborhoods little touched by the gentrification surrounding them.
Starting around 2009, as urban expansion started to run out of land, many local governments recognized the untapped potential of urban villages, and redeveloped neighborhoods. But it was mostly a local initiative until this year.
The Politburo, the Chinese Communist Party’s executive policymaking body, said in April that it would “actively and steadily advance the transformation of urban villages” in the country’s 21 largest cities. In July, China’s Cabinet, the State Council, called the policy an “important measure” to “expand domestic demand,” according to Xinhua, the state news agency.
In the last major real estate downturn, around 2015, Beijing spent hundreds of billions of dollars to pay residents cash to trade in dilapidated shacks in smaller cities and towns.
Redeveloping urban villages is more complicated and could be just as costly.
In an October report, Nomura Securities said that the process was “challenging and expensive,” and that the pace would be slow. The Chinese brokerage CITIC Securities estimated that China might invest nearly $140 billion annually for a full decade, according to an August report.
Paibang, in Shenzhen’s northwestern region, is like many other urban villages. Rows of concrete apartment blocks stand so close to each other that they are colloquially known as “handshake buildings” to describe the proximity of the neighbors. The apartments are run-down: no elevators, bars on windows and squat toilets.
A lively shopping district is on street level — fruit and vegetable stands, secondhand shops and simple eateries. In nearby industrial parks, there are printing shops, warehouses and factories. In Paibang and three neighboring villages, the vast majority of the 59,000 residents are migrants from elsewhere in China who have moved to Shenzhen for jobs.
These neighborhoods are often called the “starting point of a dream.” Chinese singer Chen Chusheng lived in an urban village in Shenzhen and performed in bars at night before he became famous. In a ballad he wrote about the experience, he sings: “People there were very close, and the distance between the buildings was just a crack.”
Shenzhen was named China’s first special economic zone in 1979, turning a fishing village of 300,000 people into the center of China’s experimentation with capitalism. Shenzhen became the birthplace of many of its most successful companies, including Huawei, BYD and Tencent.
But as Shenzhen grew, migrant workers, still essential to the local labor force, were priced out of the city’s newly developed neighborhoods.
In many villages, the land is held by a collective, and the buildings are owned by longtime villagers, many of whom moved out of the neighborhood a long time ago.
Gao Jia has run a secondhand furniture and electronics shop in Paibang for eight years. Last year, his landlords asked him to vacate after they agreed to hand over the building housing his store to Evergrande. He was delighted to win a reprieve after Evergrande’s problems brought the redevelopment project to a halt and prevented his landlords from completing the building’s sale.
“Renovating old towns does us no good at all,” Gao said. “We won’t be able to afford the rent, and we won’t be able to do business anymore.”
Duan Biqiong, a stationery shop owner, said, “If there are no migrant workers, this place is nothing but an empty town.”
In addition to pricing out some residents, urban village renewals are time-consuming. Local governments must negotiate agreements from cooperatives that own land as well as individual building owners before knocking down structures.
Officials in Guangzhou, China’s third-biggest city, with 127 urban village renovations underway this year, said the average completion time for a project had stretched from 5.5 years to more than seven years, according to local media. The longer a rehabilitation takes, the more it costs.
Jackle Zhuang, 44, owns a five-story apartment building in Paibang. When he first moved in with his family as a teenager, the neighborhood was barely developed. The nearest bus stop was a 30-minute walk away. Today, Paibang has its own subway stop.
But Zhuang doesn’t live in the neighborhood anymore. He moved with his wife and child this year to Chengdu, a city in western China more than 1,000 miles away. In Paibang, he said, there were no parks nearby, and it wasn’t safe for children because the buildings were so close to the road.
“There is probably nothing else good, apart from the cheap rent,” Zhuang said. “It’s not an ideal living environment.”
While he is ready to move on, he is not sure if the deal he signed with Evergrande in 2020 to sell his building is still valid or whether he will need to negotiate again with the new developer. He is hoping to trade in his current apartments for units in a new building.
For now, all he can do is wait and see.

Australian Leader Visits China in a Small Step Toward Reconciliation: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Both sides have been cautious in the run-up to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's trip to Beijing, avoiding terms like "reset" in favor of "stabilization."
Since 2017, Australia has played David to China's Goliath: rejecting Chinese pressure to adopt Huawei technology, calling out Chinese political interference, and demanding an inquiry into Covid-19's origins, even as Beijing blocked Australian imports ranging from coal to wine.
Now, with Australia's prime minister, Anthony Albanese, arriving Saturday for a three-day visit to China and a meeting with its top leader, Xi Jinping, reconciliation is advancing -- but with limits.
Mr. Albanese's trip represents a small step back to economic and diplomatic stability after a long march into distrust. China's coercive tariffs are disappearing. Australia's rhetoric has softened. Yet anxiety and security concerns persist.
"There will always be that nervous glance backward at this part of the relationship's history," said James Curran, a historian at the University of Sydney, referring to the tariffs and years of frozen relations. "It won't be easily erased because what came with it was a whole other set of assumptions and fears."
If Australia was and will be a bellwether for relations with China, as many Western powers believe, regular trade and dialogue -- rather than the enthusiasm for future opportunities that defined the early years of China's economic rise -- may be as good as it gets. Both sides have been cautious in the run-up to this weekend's visit, avoiding terms like "reset" in favor of "stabilization," and pointing to relatively minor concessions that have led them back to diplomacy after years of escalating rancor.
For Australia, the reversal began with a new government. Mr. Albanese was elected in May 2022 and, within weeks, defense ministers from the two countries met on the sidelines of a conference in Singapore. Soon Xiao Qian, China's ambassador to Australia, had a recalibrated pitch for improving relations.
"China looks at Australia as a friend, as a partner," he said, "and we do not see, I do not see, any reason that Australia should look at China as an enemy or as an adversary."
In December, Penny Wong, Australia's foreign minister, met with China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, in Beijing. They agreed to resume dialogue on issues like trade, climate change and defense -- an area that has become more tense with China's strong opposition to AUKUS, the 2021 security deal between Australia, the United States and England involving nuclear-powered submarines.
Ms. Wong also raised the cases of a detained Australian journalist, Cheng Lei, and the writer Yang Hengjun.
Asked if relations were warming after a period that included Beijing blocking phone calls between Australian government ministers and their Chinese counterparts, Ms. Wong said: "The ice thaws, but slowly."
And it has. Australia has withdrawn complaints to the World Trade Organization, as China has gradually agreed to review or remove the tariffs and trade bans that cost several Australian industries billions of dollars. As a result, the products on the way back to China include coal, barley and timber. Wine and lobster exports could resume in a few months.
While Mr. Yang remains in custody on questionable charges, Cheng Lei was released by Chinese authorities and returned to Australia last month.
Australia, in turn, recently announced that -- after a lengthy security review -- it would not cancel a Chinese company's 99-year lease of the northern port of Darwin.
Mr. Albanese said that Chinese management of the port, not far from where American troops rotate through the country every year, was not a safety risk, and that the decision would ensure that "Australia remains a competitive destination for foreign investment."
China welcomed the decision as a sign that economics were once again becoming a more dominant element of the bilateral relationship.
"On the one hand, after coming to power, Australian Prime Minister Albanese recognized the importance of the Chinese market and sought reconciliation with China," said Peng Qinglong, the director of the Center for Australian Studies at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. "On the other hand, the current global economic situation is not optimistic, and this background has prompted the two sides to engage in communication and dialogue."
But for China, many analysts argue, the reason for welcoming Australia back into the fold goes beyond just business. Since 2018, when Mr. Xi eliminated term limits and made himself leader for life, his approach at home and abroad has rankled many countries that, like Australia, count China as a top trade partner.
The Philippines, after flirting with closer ties to Beijing, has tilted more toward the United States in part because of China's expansive claims and aggressive advances into disputed waters of the South China Sea. India, after clashes at its border with China in 2020, has also expanded defense ties with Washington, seeing Beijing as more of a threat.
"China's power projection in the region is raising eyebrows and challenging its own image as a responsible power," said Courtney J. Fung, an Asia Society Australia scholar-in-residence. She added: "Working to build a more positive relationship with Australia can help China repair its image in the region."
How much of that reputation can be repaired remains an open question. Chinese officials have made clear they are still unhappy about AUKUS and other groupings, like the Quad, that they see as an American-led effort to encircle and threaten China.
Polls in Australia also show deep skepticism about the Chinese government's intentions: One recent survey found that 75 percent of Australians see China becoming a military threat to Australia in the next 20 years.
Even among those set to benefit from the stabilization in relations, the impact of the past few years seems destined to limit exuberance.
Nikki Palun, an Australian winery owner, used to ship more than two million bottles of wine to China a year, representing 90 percent of her business. But the effect of China's tariffs was drastic, and will linger.
"I've been forced to diversify, and I really like the direction the business is going," she said. "I will go back to China, of course, but it might represent only 20 or 30 percent of my sales."
In Washington, as well, the assessment of China's outreach efforts remains bleak. While there is talk of Mr. Xi meeting with President Biden on the sidelines of a regional economic summit in San Francisco this month, many American officials have lowered their expectations because Mr. Xi and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia have cemented their partnership over the war in Ukraine.
In speeches at home, Mr. Xi has repeatedly de-emphasized the economy and prioritized national security, warning that China faces "dangerous storms" ahead around the world.
"China is not switching direction and opening up anytime soon, whether that's politically, economically or militarily," said Oriana Skylar Mastro, a fellow at Stanford University's Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies.
Mr. Albanese's trip to China, which coincides with the 50th anniversary of the first visit by an Australian prime minister, is fresh off a state visit to the United States.
In Washington, Mr. Biden warned Australia to be careful, to avoid investing too heavily in Chinese promises.
"'Trust but verify' is the phrase," he said.
Given recent history, Mr. Albanese is likely to heed that advice.

Apple's Sales Slide Yet Again, But Profits Rise: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Interest in new iPhones and services such as music and cloud storage powered the quarter, but other businesses, such as Mac sales, slowed significantly.
At a time when the tech industry's biggest companies are rebounding from a post-pandemic dip, Apple is suffering through its most prolonged sales slump in more than a decade.
On Thursday, the world's most valuable tech company said that sales fell 1 percent, to $ 89.5 billion, from last year for the three months that ended in September, bringing an end to a fiscal year in which it posted sales declines every quarter. The company reported that profits rose 11 percent, to $ 22.96 billion.
Apple's most important business, the iPhone, rallied last month behind the release of four new devices, which boosted sales 3 percent, to $ 43.81 billion, from last year. And the company's sales for software and services, such as Apple Music and cloud storage, jumped 16 percent, to $ 22.31 billion.
But sales sank for most of the company's other businesses, including the Mac, iPad, and the Apple Watch and AirPods. Total product sales dropped by 5 percent, to $ 67.18 billion.
The results exceeded Wall Street's expectations for $ 89.34 billion in sales and $ 21.77 billion in profit. The company said that it expected sales to be similar in the current quarter to the same period a year ago, disappointing Wall Street, which had projected that sales would increase from a year ago.
Apple's shares have declined 11 percent from their peak this summer and were down more than 3 percent in after-hour trading on Thursday.
Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, faces a bevy of challenges in the year ahead. After a surge in demand for new 5G iPhones, wireless carriers are reporting a slowdown in the number of people buying new smartphones in the United States, Apple's largest market, according to Arete Research, an investment research firm.
The company said that supply constraints for the iPhone 15 in September blunted sales during the month, but that supplies were improving and would be able to fulfill demand in the current quarter.
In China, Apple is confronting renewed competition in the luxury smartphone business from Huawei. The Chinese smartphone maker had been hampered in recent years by U.S. restrictions on its access to 5G technology and Android software, but in August it revealed a jade-green smartphone, Mate 60 Pro, that has the same capabilities as many iPhones. Its release was followed by the Chinese government directing employees of some government agencies to stop using iPhones for work.
Sales of Apple's new flagship iPhones declined 4.5 percent during the final weeks of September from last year, according to Counterpoint Research, which analyzes the smartphone market. The dip was an outgrowth of the broader downturn in consumer spending in China, the firm said.
Last month, China expanded its challenge to Apple's business by launching a regulatory review of the company's biggest iPhone manufacturer, Foxconn of Taiwan. The manufacturer is facing a tax audit and being investigated over its compliance with land use regulations. The scrutiny comes as Terry Gou, Foxconn's founder, runs for Taiwan's presidency in a campaign that could boost the ruling party, which opposes closer ties with Beijing.
Mr. Cook traveled to China last month in an unannounced visit that included stops at an Apple store, a visit to the factory of Luxshare Precision, a Chinese iPhone manufacturer, and a meeting with Wang Wentao, the country's commerce minister.
"I could not be more excited about the interactions I had with customers and employees," Mr. Cook said during a call with analysts on Thursday. He said that the company's business in China remained strong, adding that the iPhone business set a record in mainland China during the three months that ended in September.
The broader tech industry has been lifted by enthusiasm for generative artificial intelligence. Last month, Microsoft reported that investments in A.I. were beginning to help sales of its cloud-computing business. Google's parent company, Alphabet, which has invested heavily in A.I., disappointed investors, who had hoped for a greater lift to sales. Amazon and Meta Platforms, Facebook's parent company, also emphasized their investments in that area.
But Apple, which is known for its secrecy, has been quiet about its plans for generative A.I. On Thursday, Mr. Cook said that the company was investing in generative A.I. but was unlikely to provide details until it had a product to bring to market. "We're going to do it responsibly, and you're going to see product advancements over time where those technologies are at the heart," Mr. Cook said.
As it looks ahead to next year, much of the company's focus will shift to the release of its first major new product since 2014: high-tech goggles that blend the real world with virtual reality. The $ 3,500 device, the Vision Pro, has the potential to provide a new revenue stream at a time when sales of its other products have slowed. Analysts project Apple will sell fewer than half a million units.
The company also is focused on reviving sales of its iPads and Macs. On Monday, Apple revealed new MacBook Pros and iMacs with speedier processors and encouraged customers with older Macs to upgrade. Sales of Macs declined 27 percent, to $ 29.36 billion, over the past fiscal year.

Chip Makers At the Heart Of a Rivalry With Beijing: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The United States is taking unusual action to clamp down on sales of chip-making machinery to China, even as Chinese firms are racing to stockpile the equipment.
They are smooth white boxes, roughly the size of large cargo vans, and they are now at the heart of the U.S.-Chinese technology conflict.
As the United States tries to slow China's progress toward technological advances that could help its military, the complex lithography machines that print intricate circuitry on computer chips have become a key choke point.
The machines are central to China's efforts to develop its own chip-making industry, but China does not yet have the technology to make them, at least in their most advanced forms. This week, U.S. officials took steps to curb China's progress toward that goal by barring companies globally from sending additional types of chip-making machines to China, unless they obtain a special license from the U.S. government.
The move could be a significant blow to China's chip-manufacturing ambitions. It is also an unusual flexing of American regulatory power. American officials took the position that they could regulate equipment manufactured outside the United States if it contains even just one American-made part.
That decision gives U.S. officials new sway over companies in the Netherlands and Japan, where some of the most advanced chip machinery is made. In particular, U.S. rules will now stop shipments of some machines that use deep ultraviolet, or DUV, technology made mainly by the Dutch firm ASML, which dominates the lithography market.
Vera Kranenburg, a China researcher at the Clingendael Institute, a Dutch think tank, said that while ASML had made clear that it would follow the regulations, the company was already chafing under earlier regulations that barred it from exporting a more sophisticated lithography machine to China.
"They're of course not happy about the export controls," she said.
After being thrust into geopolitics yet again, ASML has been careful in its response, saying in a statement this week that it complies with all laws and regulations in the countries where it operates. Peter Wennink, the chief executive, said the company would not be able to ship certain tools to "just a handful" of Chinese chip factories. But "it is still sales that we had in 2023 that we'll not have in 2024," he added.
In a statement, the Dutch foreign trade minister, Liesje Schreinemacher, said that the Netherlands shared U.S. security concerns and continuously exchanges information with the United States, but that "ultimately, every country decides for itself what export restrictions to impose." She pointed to more permissive restrictions announced by the Dutch government in June.
A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Commerce declined to comment.
ASML's technology has enabled leaps in global computing power. The increasing precision of its machines -- which have tens of thousands of components and cost as much as hundreds of millions of dollars each -- has allowed circuitry on chips to get progressively smaller, letting companies pack more computing power into a tiny piece of silicon.
The technology has also given the United States and its allies an important source of leverage over China, as governments compete to turn technological gains into military advantages. Although Beijing is pouring money into the semiconductor industry, Chinese chip-making equipment remains many years behind the prowess of ASML and other key machine suppliers, including Applied Materials and Lam Research in the United States and Tokyo Electron and Canon in Japan.
But U.S. efforts to weaponize this technological advantage against China appear to be straining alliances. In Europe, government officials increasingly agree with the United States that China poses a geopolitical and economic threat. But they are still wary of undercutting their own companies by blocking them from China, one of the world's largest and most vibrant tech markets.
Dutch technology, in particular, has been the focus of a multiyear pressure campaign from the United States. In 2019, the Trump administration persuaded the Dutch to block shipments to China of ASML's most state-of-the-art machine, which uses extreme ultraviolet technology.
After months of diplomatic pressure from the Biden administration, the governments of the Netherlands and Japan agreed in January that they would also independently curb sales of some deep ultraviolet lithography machines and other types of advanced chip-making equipment to China.
The United States and its allies have viewed sales of the deep ultraviolet lithography machines as less of a national security risk. The chips they produce are considerably less advanced than those built with the most cutting-edge machines, which now power the latest smartphones, supercomputers and A.I. models.
But that position was tested this summer when a Chinese firm used ASML's deep ultraviolet lithography technology along with other advanced machines to blow past a technological barrier that U.S. officials had hoped to keep China from reaching.
In August, the Chinese telecom giant Huawei unexpectedly released a new smartphone containing a Chinese-made chip with transistor dimensions rated at seven nanometers, just a couple of technology generations behind the latest chips made in Taiwan. Analysts have concluded that China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation made the chip with the use of the Dutch deep ultraviolet lithography machinery.
Gregory C. Allen, a technology expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, said the new export control rules had been in the works long before the Huawei announcement. But, he said, the development "helped leaders throughout the U.S. government understand that there was no more time to waste and that updated controls were urgently needed."
Mr. Allen said the controls would not necessarily break China's most advanced chip-makers immediately, since they had already stockpiled a lot of advanced machinery. But it would "dramatically restrict" their ability to manufacture the most advanced kinds of semiconductors, like seven-nanometer chips, he said.
For now, ASML is still doing brisk business with China. In its earnings report this week, ASML said sales to China had surged in the third quarter to account for 46 percent of the company's global total, far above historical levels.
Analysts at TD Cowen estimated that ASML's China sales would reach 5.5 billion euros (about $ 5.8 billion) this year, more than double the total last year. Next year, the new export controls could cut 10 to 15 percent off the company's China revenues, they projected.
Roger Dassen, ASML's chief financial officer, said in the earnings call that most of the orders that ASML was completing this year had been placed in 2022 or even the year before, and were largely for machines that would make slightly older types of chips.
All the shipments were "very much within the limits of export regulation," Mr. Dassen said.
For the machines that face new U.S. restrictions, the Dutch company will now be barred from supplying replacement parts and helping to service those systems. That will mean Chinese companies are likely to have manufacturing problems at some point.
These hugely expensive machines rely on regular software and maintenance support to continue churning out chips, said Joanne Chiao, a semiconductor analyst at TrendForce, a market research firm.
ASML is not the only equipment supplier caught up in the latest restrictions. Other kinds of advanced machines that are essential to produce the most advanced chips, like those from the U.S. companies Applied Materials and Lam Research, are detailed in the latest restrictions.
Lam, in a conference call on Wednesday, said revenue from China jumped 48 percent in its first fiscal quarter as companies stocked up on machines to make both mature chips and advanced products. It had already estimated that restrictions on sales to China would hold down revenue this year by $ 2 billion; executives added that the expanded rules issued this week wouldn't materially change that estimate.
An Applied Materials spokesman said the company was still reviewing the new rules to gauge their potential impact.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
WASHINGTON — They are smooth white boxes, roughly the size of large cargo vans, and they are now at the heart of the U.S.-Chinese technology conflict.
As the United States tries to slow China’s progress toward technological advances that could help its military, the complex lithography machines that print intricate circuitry on computer chips have become a key choke point.
The machines are central to China’s efforts to develop its own chipmaking industry, but China does not yet have the technology to make them, at least in their most advanced forms. This week, U.S. officials took steps to curb China’s progress toward that goal by barring companies globally from sending additional types of chipmaking machines to China, unless they obtain a special license from the U.S. government.
The move could be a significant blow to China’s chip manufacturing ambitions. It is also an unusual flexing of American regulatory power. U.S. officials took the position that they could regulate equipment manufactured outside the United States if it contains even just one American-made part.
That decision gives U.S. officials new sway over companies in the Netherlands and Japan, where some of the most advanced chip machinery is made. In particular, U.S. rules will now stop shipments of some machines that use deep ultraviolet, or DUV, technology made mainly by the Dutch firm ASML, which dominates the lithography market.
Vera Kranenburg, a China researcher at the Clingendael Institute, a Dutch think tank, said that while ASML had made clear that it would follow the regulations, the company was chafing under earlier regulations that barred it from exporting a more sophisticated lithography machine to China.
“They’re of course not happy about the export controls,” she said.
After being thrust into geopolitics yet again, ASML has been careful in its response, saying in a statement this week that it complies with all laws and regulations in the countries where it operates. CEO Peter Wennink said the company would not be able to ship certain tools to “just a handful” of Chinese chip factories. But “it is still sales that we had in 2023 that we’ll not have in 2024,” he added.
In a statement, the Dutch foreign trade minister, Liesje Schreinemacher, said that the Netherlands shared U.S. security concerns and continuously exchanges information with the United States, but that “ultimately, every country decides for itself what export restrictions to impose.” She pointed to more permissive restrictions announced by the Dutch government in June.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Commerce declined to comment.
ASML’s technology has enabled leaps in global computing power. The increasing precision of its machines — which have tens of thousands of components and cost as much as hundreds of millions of dollars each — has allowed circuitry on chips to get progressively smaller, letting companies pack more computing power into a tiny piece of silicon.
The technology has also given the United States and its allies an important source of leverage over China, as governments compete to turn technological gains into military advantages. Although Beijing is pouring money into the semiconductor industry, Chinese chipmaking equipment remains many years behind the prowess of ASML and other key machine suppliers, including Applied Materials and Lam Research in the United States and Tokyo Electron and Canon in Japan.
But U.S. efforts to weaponize this technological advantage against China appear to be straining alliances. In Europe, government officials increasingly agree with the United States that China poses a geopolitical and economic threat. But they are still wary of undercutting their own companies by blocking them from China, one of the world’s largest and most vibrant tech markets.
Dutch technology, in particular, has been the focus of a multiyear pressure campaign from the United States. In 2019, the Trump administration persuaded the Dutch to block shipments to China of ASML’s most state-of-the-art machine, which uses extreme ultraviolet technology.
After months of diplomatic pressure from the Biden administration, the governments of the Netherlands and Japan agreed in January that they would also independently curb sales of some deep ultraviolet lithography machines and other types of advanced chipmaking equipment to China.
The United States and its allies have viewed sales of the deep ultraviolet lithography machines as less of a national security risk. The chips they produce are considerably less advanced than those built with the most cutting-edge machines, which now power the latest smartphones, supercomputers and artificial intelligence models.
But that position was tested this summer when a Chinese firm used ASML’s deep ultraviolet lithography technology along with other advanced machines to blow past a technological barrier that U.S. officials had hoped to keep China from reaching.
In August, Chinese telecom giant Huawei unexpectedly released a new smartphone containing a Chinese-made chip with transistor dimensions rated at 7 nanometers, just a couple of technology generations behind the latest chips made in Taiwan. Analysts have concluded that China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. made the chip with the use of the Dutch deep ultraviolet lithography machinery.
Gregory Allen, a technology expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, said the new export control rules had been in the works long before the Huawei announcement. But, he said, the development “helped leaders throughout the U.S. government understand that there was no more time to waste and that updated controls were urgently needed.”
Allen said the controls would not necessarily break China’s most advanced chipmakers immediately, since they had stockpiled a lot of advanced machinery. But it would “dramatically restrict” their ability to manufacture the most advanced kinds of semiconductors, such as 7-nanometer chips, he said.
For now, ASML is still doing brisk business with China. In its earnings report this week, ASML said sales to China had surged in the third quarter to account for 46% of the company’s global total, far above historical levels.
Analysts at TD Cowen estimated that ASML’s China sales would reach 5.5 billion euros (about $5.8 billion) this year, more than double the total last year. Next year, the new export controls could cut 10% to 15% off the company’s China revenues, they projected.
Roger Dassen, ASML’s chief financial officer, said in the earnings call that most of the orders that ASML was completing this year had been placed in 2022 or even the year before, and were largely for machines that would make slightly older types of chips.
All the shipments were “very much within the limits of export regulation,” Dassen said.
For the machines that face new U.S. restrictions, the Dutch company will now be barred from supplying replacement parts and helping to service those systems. That will mean Chinese companies are likely to have manufacturing problems at some point.
These hugely expensive machines rely on regular software and maintenance support to continue churning out chips, said Joanne Chiao, a semiconductor analyst at TrendForce, a market research firm.
ASML is not the only equipment supplier caught up in the latest restrictions. Other kinds of advanced machines that are essential to produce the most advanced chips, including those from the U.S. companies Applied Materials and Lam Research, are detailed in the latest restrictions.
Lam, in a conference call Wednesday, said revenue from China jumped 48% in its first fiscal quarter as companies stocked up on machines to make both mature chips and advanced products. It had estimated that restrictions on sales to China would hold down revenue this year by $2 billion; executives added that the expanded rules issued this week wouldn’t materially change that estimate.
An Applied Materials spokesperson said the company was still reviewing the new rules to gauge their potential impact.

Nokia Slashes 14,000 Jobs After 69% Profit Drop: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After a disappointing quarter, the Finnish technology company announced significant spending cuts.
Nokia announced a major overhaul of its business on Thursday that includes slashing up to 14,000 jobs, or about 16 percent of its work force, over the next three years.
The company employs 86,000 people and said the "reset" would reduce its costs by as much as 1.2 billion euros, or roughly $ 1.3 billion. It made the announcement as it reported a 20 percent decline in sales and a 69 percent dive in profits in the most recent quarter, from July through September, compared with last year.
"In the face of a challenging market environment, we will reduce our cost base to protect our profitability," the company's chief executive, Pekka Lundmark, said in a video statement.
Nokia once led the global mobile phone market, but it quickly fell behind the iPhone, which Apple released in 2007. Nokia sold its mobile phone division to Microsoft in 2013. Since then, it has focused on selling the back-end infrastructure of telecom systems to wireless companies, cable operators and other business buyers.
Nokia said that "macroeconomic uncertainty and higher interest rates continue to pressure" its customers. The company has also been struggling after losing out on market share in 5G technology to rivals in China, said John Strand, a telecom analyst in Copenhagen. Chinese companies, led by Huawei, control nearly half the global 5G market.
Nokia halted sales in Russia in March 2022 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. At the time, the company had been selling equipment to MTS, Russia's largest telecom service provider. Documents obtained by The New York Times revealed that Nokia had been enabling a Russian surveillance system for almost a decade.
Nokia isn't the only Western telecom group to face cuts: One of its main competitors, Sweden's Ericsson, has also laid off thousands of employees this year because of lower demand for its products and services.
"Nokia's problems are pretty much the same across Western operators," Mr. Strand said. "They are hit by increasing energy prices, inflation and interest."

Australian Broadcaster Held by China Is Freed: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Cheng Lei, a host for China's international broadcaster, was arrested in Beijing at a time of rising tensions with Australia. Her release signals a warming.
Cheng Lei, an Australian journalist who was held in Beijing for more than three years, has returned to Australia, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Wednesday.
Mr. Albanese said Ms. Cheng had been reunited with her two young children in Melbourne.
"Her return brings an end to a very difficult few years for Cheng and her family," Mr. Albanese said at a news conference on Wednesday.
Ms. Cheng, who worked for China's global television network, was detained in Beijing in August 2020 and formally arrested later on suspicion of sharing national secrets. A familiar face as a business news host for China Global Television News, Ms. Cheng, 48, had long presented herself as a bridge between China and Australia, according to friends.
On Wednesday, China's foreign ministry said Ms. Cheng had been sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison. "After serving her sentence, Cheng Lei was deported by the Beijing State Security Bureau in accordance with the law," said Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry. Until now China had said little about the case.
The secrecy around the investigation prompted speculation that Ms. Cheng was targeted because relations between China and Australia had reached a low point. Her release this week is a sign of less animosity between the two countries.
"Gradually, the freeze has been thawing, and I think the resolution of this case is a big part of that," said Richard McGregor, a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney.
Ms. Cheng's arrest came amid several high-profile detentions of foreigners in China, prompting questions about whether the Chinese government was increasingly using "hostage diplomacy."
Two months before Ms. Cheng was detained, the Chinese authorities indicted two Canadians who had been held since 2018 -- the former diplomat Michael Kovrig and a businessman, Michael Spavor -- on espionage charges that appeared to be tied to the arrest of a Chinese technology executive in Canada on a U.S. warrant. The two men were released in 2021when Canada and the United States allowed the executive, Meng Wanzhou of Huawei Technologies, to return to China.
After years of downward spiral, ties between China and Australia have improved significantly since early last year, when Mr. Albanese and his Labor Party won an election. Mr. Albanese has since tried to improve the relationship and is expected to meet with China's top leader, Xi Jinping, later this year for the second time since he became prime minister.
"China is willing to work with Australia to promote the continuous improvement and development of bilateral relations," said Mr. Wang, the foreign ministry spokesman.
Another Australian, the writer Yang Hengjun, is still in jail in China. He was arrested in 2019 and stood trial in May 2021, but a verdict in his case has been repeatedly delayed.
"Both Ms. Cheng and Mr. Yang were detained when relations were in a free fall," said Mr. McGregor.
Earlier this year from her prison cell, Ms. Cheng dictated a letter to an Australian consular official describing the difficult conditions she was experiencing.
"In my cell, the sunlight shines through the window, but I can stand in it for only 10 hours a year," Ms. Cheng said in the letter. She also said that she missed Australia, where she grew up, and its people.
"Most of all," she said, "I miss my children."

How the Global Economy Became Weaponized: [Op-Ed]

Full text: The greatest collateral damage from last year's Russian invasion of Ukraine has been to various Western European members of NATO, which suddenly find their national interests subordinated to those of their strongest ally.
The United States has long wanted Europeans to kick over two of the pillars on which their economies rest: imports of cheap energy from Russia and exports of advanced manufactures to China, Russia's ally. With the Russian invasion last year, these demands became more importunate. Europe has largely complied with them. The European Union voted for an embargo of Russian oil in the early days of the war. Germany, where dependence on China is arguably strongest, published its first comprehensive strategy for "de-risking" its China trade this past summer.
The cost has been high. In Germany's case, the International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development predict that it will perform worse this year than any other advanced economy. Certainly there are many reasons for Germany's slowdown: Interest rates are high, supply chains have been disrupted by disease and war, and the country's car industry faces new competition from electric vehicles. But it does not help that, as the sociologist Wolfgang Streeck wrote recently in American Affairs magazine, Germany is being asked to participate in "an economic war that is to some extent also a war against Germany itself."
While most Europeans deem Russia a threat on their doorstep, they do not feel the same way about China. A study this past summer by the European Council on Foreign Relations found large majorities, 62 percent continentwide, would wish for Europe to remain neutral should the United States and China ever enter into conflict over Taiwan. Yet last April, when President Emmanuel Macron of France urged his fellow Europeans to preserve their "strategic autonomy" in Sino-American matters and avoid getting swept up in "a logic of bloc against bloc," he was rebuffed, not just by American politicians but also by certain of his European allies.
It used to be that when Europeans needed a bit of wiggle room from the American empire on a matter of desperate importance, they could simply claim it. In 2002 and 2003, the chancellor of Germany, Gerhard Schröder, and President Jacques Chirac of France defied the government of George W. Bush, refusing to participate in the invasion of Iraq. What has changed to give American preferences the power of binding imperial fiat?
It is partly that Europe's countries are militarily dependent on the United States. Since most of them have budgeted well under 2 percent of their gross domestic products on defense for many years, they are probably more dependent than they were two decades ago. But the system by which the United States seeks to lay down laws for the whole world has more to do with economics than with brute force. Over the past two decades, the United States has made use of a novel, often mysterious set of tools for rewarding those who help it and punishing those who cross it.
That set of tools is now a bit less mysterious, thanks to two political scientists, Henry Farrell of Johns Hopkins and Abraham Newman of Georgetown. Their book published last month, "Underground Empire: How America Weaponized the Global Economy," reveals how the United States benefits from a set of institutions built up late last century as neutral means of streamlining global markets.
These institutions include the dollar and the bank-messaging system known as Swift (the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication), which is based in Belgium and run by an international board but vulnerable to American pressure. It helps that the rise of the internet has made the United States home to much of the wired world's circuitry and infrastructure, including, in our time, some of the major cloud computing centers of Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google.
The United States now has the ability to survey and influence the world's communications and supply chains, should it choose to. After the Sept. 11 attacks, it chose to. It bent the institutions to which it had access into a defensive (as it then saw things) weapon in the war on terror. "To protect America," Mr. Farrell and Mr. Newman write, "Washington has slowly but surely turned thriving economic networks into tools of domination."
It has taken the ingenuity of four presidential administrations to build the global economy into a U.S. strategic asset, to be used against (primarily) Iran, China and Russia. It was George W. Bush who passed the USA Patriot Act, Title III of which aimed to prevent terrorists from money laundering within the U.S. financial system, but wound up giving American regulators leverage over foreign financial entities of all kinds.
By the middle of the Obama administration, U.S. officials had successfully pushed Swift to bar Iranian banks and threatened Swiss bankers with prosecution if they did not dismantle the country's centuries-old traditions of banking secrecy. That brought Switzerland's old and lucrative banking model to an end. Increasingly, friends as well as foes had something to fear from the system.
The Trump administration wielded American network power with gusto, consummating a plan to disrupt the Chinese phone giant Huawei. As Mr. Farrell and Mr. Newman detail in their book, Huawei's London-based bank, HSBC, was pressured to share data with the United States. That data generated evidence leading to Canada's arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer in Vancouver in 2018. In a separate case the next year, the State Department sought to bribe an Indian sea captain who was suspected of delivering a shipment of Iranian oil, urging that he surrender his ship to a port where it could be impounded.
Under President Biden, the United States has broken yet another fiduciary tradition that used to bind it back in the days before Sept. 11. It arranged to freeze not only Afghanistan's modest $ 7 billion central bank reserves in the wake of its retreat from that country, but also, with the help of its allies, Russia's reserves (dozens of times as large) in the wake of the 2022 invasion. The United States now also proposes to spend some of these reserves on what it deems worthier ends: compensating Sept. 11 victims in the first case, rebuilding Ukraine in the second.
American policymakers have weaponized the world economy in a way that is hard for democracies to register, let alone influence. There are a lot of legitimate populist complaints to be made about this sort of elite control: You hear all the time in Italy and Poland, for instance, about how the European Union entrapped member states in its post-Covid recovery fund programs and then attached unreasonable conditions for delivering the money.
The most striking thing about the Farrell-Newman critique -- and perhaps a source of its strength -- is that it is not populist. The authors' understanding of the Russia-Ukraine conflict -- as an unprovoked Russian attack by a leader who "seems to believe the Cold War never finished" -- differs little from that of the State Department. Even their account of the American regulatory empire is a description more than a gripe. The authors hint they would not be half so worried about these regulatory means if only they served worthier ends -- say, fighting climate change instead of protecting American hegemony.
Whatever it may be used for, the weaponization of the global economy is proving to be an unreliable tool of American might. The problem is that in the economy as it has existed since the Cold War, everyone pretty much trades with everyone. Countries that have the most reason to fear the United States have responded by trying to construct alternative arrangements. Over the past year and a half, Russia has shown a resilience in the face of an all-out economic war that China and Iran are likely to use as a model. By contrast, those countries that are friendliest to the United States -- Switzerland a decade ago, Germany today -- have suffered for not yet having bomb-proofed their economies against the American economic weapon.

Full text: Nvidia, Intel and Qualcomm are campaigning to protect their businesses before further crackdowns on the sale of semiconductor technology to Beijing.
A year after the Biden administration took its first major step toward restricting the sale of semiconductors to China, it has begun drafting additional limits aimed at denying Beijing the technology critical to modern-day weapons.
But in recent months, its progress has been slowed as American chip companies have pushed back with a blunt warning: Cutting sales to China would gut their businesses and derail the administration's plan to build new semiconductor factories in the United States.
Since July, Nvidia, Intel and Qualcomm, three of the world's largest chip makers, have pressed their case that cracking down on China would have unintended consequences. They have challenged the White House's national security wisdom in meetings with officials like Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Commerce Secretary Gina M. Raimondo, wooed think tanks and urged leaders across Washington to reconsider additional chip controls, according to interviews with two dozen officials across the government, industry and policy organizations.
The companies have warned that a U.S. pullback could accelerate China's development of an independent chip industry, paving the way to a world dominated by Chinese-created chips rather than American-designed chips.
"What you risk is spurring the development of an ecosystem that's led by competitors," said Tim Teter, Nvidia's general counsel, who has helped lead the lobbying campaign. "And that can have a very negative effect on the U.S. leadership in semiconductors, advanced technology and A.I."
The campaign has contributed to the delay of new restrictions and narrowed the list of changes that the administration may make, two people familiar with the process said. But spokespeople for the Commerce Department and the National Security Council, which lead the rule-making process, said the agencies were committed to protecting sensitive technology.
"The timing and scope of export control decisions are carefully designed to have the maximum impact," said Sarah Weinstein, a spokeswoman for the Commerce Department.
The push by the big chip companies has rankled some national security experts, lawmakers and semiconductor rivals. Many favor confronting Beijing and find it distasteful that the companies have questioned the White House shortly after the government committed $ 50 billion to the industry through the CHIPS and Science Act. The 2022 measure provides money to bolster American chip manufacturing and counter China.
Representative Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, the Republican chairman of a select committee on U.S.-Chinese competition, has discussed holding a hearing with the chip companies to question their compliance with export controls, two people familiar with the conversations said.
A spokesman for Mr. Gallagher's office did not respond to requests for comment.
The warnings from the companies speak to the tension between national security concerns and commercial interests and highlight an unavoidable quandary for the Biden administration: The economic interdependence of the United States and China, which has roots stretching back decades, means that any action by Washington to confront Beijing risks causing harm at home.
China accounts for about a third of the global semiconductor market and more than $ 50 billion in combined annual revenue for Nvidia, Intel and Qualcomm. The companies have cautioned that losing that revenue could force cuts in technology development, jobs and spending on semiconductor factories in Arizona, Ohio and New York.
Last year, the industry tacitly accepted the restrictions that the administration issued on Oct. 7, shortly after President Biden signed the CHIPS Act. Companies adjusted their businesses. Nvidia developed a version of its signature artificial intelligence chip, the H100, for China by reducing its performance power below the maximum levels that the rules allowed.
But losses associated with the restrictions mounted. China banned the sale of some products from Micron Technology, an American memory chip company. National security experts in Washington identified shortcomings with the limits. And administration officials started questioning whether Nvidia's chip for China contravened the spirit of the rules.
In July, industry executives were alarmed by talk that the administration was close to expanding its limits by banning Nvidia's sales of the A.I. chip it developed for Chinese use, among other changes. They worried that the administration could also target Nvidia's and Intel's sales to subsidiaries of Inspur Group, a Chinese conglomerate with military ties, and Qualcomm's sale of 4G mobile chips to the Chinese telecom giant Huawei, which it had a special permit to supply, two industry executives said.
That month, three chief executives -- Patrick Gelsinger of Intel, Jensen Huang of Nvidia and Cristiano Amon of Qualcomm -- traveled to Washington to meet with the administration.
During meetings with Mr. Blinken, Ms. Raimondo and Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden's national security adviser, the chief executives outlined the costs of losing access to China and warned that it could force spending cuts in the United States, Mr. Gelsinger said when recounting the meeting at a security conference in Aspen, Colo.
In conversations with White House officials, Intel officials also questioned whether National Security Council aides understood semiconductor technology, two sources familiar with the companies' activities said.
An Intel spokesman said that it was "absolutely untrue" that the company had questioned security officials.
The companies also pressed their trade group, the Semiconductor Industry Association, to issue a statement criticizing the government's restrictions as "broad, ambiguous and at times unilateral." It warned that further limits would harm "the industry's competitiveness."
When the statement was drafted, no members of the association spoke out against it, according to three people familiar with the process, but several members later said it had made them uneasy because of the Biden administration's support of the CHIPS Act.
The Semiconductor Industry Association declined to comment.
The companies broadened their campaign to target think tank researchers, as well. This summer, Mr. Huang met with the leaders of organizations including the security-focused Center for Strategic and International Studies and the Atlantic Council.
Nvidia's interest in think tanks raised some alarm, with word spreading across Washington that the company had questioned the research of Gregory C. Allen, the director of a center for advanced studies at C.S.I.S. who supports export restrictions, four of these people said.
Amid discussions between Nvidia and members of C.S.I.S.'s fund-raising staff, several people in policy circles, including Jason Matheny, the president of the RAND Corporation, called the center to voice concerns that Nvidia was trying to use its influence to sideline Mr. Allen, two people familiar with the calls said.
John Hamre, C.S.I.S.'s chief executive, assured Mr. Matheny and others that companies couldn't influence personnel decisions. In an email to The New York Times, Mr. Allen said, "He told me that he was proud of my contributions to C.S.I.S -- he had just promoted me only a few months earlier -- and had absolutely no intention to fire me now or in the future."
Eventually, Nvidia donated $ 65,000 to C.S.I.S., which amounted to less than 1 percent of annual donations, according to the think tank. It said Nvidia had not behaved "improperly."
Mr. Teter, Nvidia's general counsel, said the company had never taken issue with Mr. Allen's work. "We're confident he's presenting the best research he can, and we completely respect that," he said.
In addition to meeting with the White House, the chief executives met with Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive and chairman of Google.
Since stepping aside as executive chairman of Google in 2018, Mr. Schmidt has emerged as a power player in Washington, serving on two Defense Department advisory boards and funding his own think tank, the Special Competitive Studies Project. He also has supported limiting China's access to American-designed semiconductors.
In mid-July, Mr. Gelsinger, Mr. Amon and Mr. Huang talked to Mr. Schmidt about the pitfalls of chip limits, two people briefed on the conversation said. Representatives for Mr. Schmidt declined to comment.
Last month, Mr. Schmidt's think tank invited Mr. Gelsinger and Mr. Huang to give fireside chats at an annual conference in Washington on national security and technology. Neither executive fielded questions about semiconductor restrictions and China.

Full text: Leaked internal messages detail efforts by the Chinese tech giant to court Greek officials and fight an American-led effort against its technology.
In November 2020, executives at Huawei, the Chinese telecom-equipment maker, exchanged messages about holding a meeting with a "friend" and an "adviser" in Greece.
The contacts, identified as Greek government advisers, were set to provide Huawei with something valuable: a document outlining government contracts and "first priority projects" that the company might want to work on in the country. Huawei managers discussed giving the advisers a Huawei Mate XS smartphone, the company's GT 2 smartwatch and wine, according to internal text messages and other documents reviewed by The New York Times.
The plans are "strictly confidential among us," a Huawei manager wrote in a group chat named after Greece's digital ministry.
The exchange was part of more than 120 messages and summaries of internal Huawei communications provided to The Times by a person working for a European government that investigated the company. The materials, which identified the contacts as government officials, offer a rare look at how Huawei tried to cultivate relationships with high-ranking figures in Greece, a small but important country for the company, and pushed the limits of Greek rules that restrict gifts to civil servants and government ministers.
In the communications, Huawei employees discussed providing gadgets to a senior Greek government minister and his son, giving devices to police and immigration officials and organizing transportation for Greek regulators during an industry conference in the United Arab Emirates in 2021. The messages did not say whether the gifts were ultimately delivered or if deals for the priority projects were signed.
Huawei, which sits in the middle of a technological Cold War between the United States and China, has been under a cloud for more than five years over fears that Beijing can use its technology for spying or sabotage. The company has denied the accusations.
The U.S. government has restricted the use of Huawei equipment in the country and cut the company off from access to certain American technology. U.S. officials have also aggressively lobbied allies to ban Huawei's gear in Europe, the company's largest market outside China.
Greece is a prime example of the mixed success of the American lobbying campaign. It has not prohibited Huawei's products outright, and the company has battled to keep its hard-won hold in the country.
"Huawei views the U.S. actions as an existential threat," said Emily Kilcrease, a former deputy assistant U.S. trade representative who studies the U.S.-Chinese economic relationship at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank.
The Times corroborated the internal communications, which were sent from 2020 to 2021, at the height of American efforts to ban Huawei technology, by matching names, phone numbers and other information in the messages. The Times agreed not to disclose the government that conducted the investigation.
"Huawei conducts business ethically and with integrity, and complies with all applicable laws and regulations in every country and region in which we operate," the company said in a statement.
Pavlos Marinakis, a Greek government spokesman, said Huawei's technology had a limited presence in the country's new telecom networks.
"There has never been, whatsoever, any direct or indirect influence by said company in government policy decisions, agreements and/or contracts," he said in an email.
Entrenched in Europe
Ren Zhengfei, Huawei's founder, has such an affinity for Europe that the company's campus in Dongguan, China, includes replicas of buildings in Paris and Heidelberg, Germany. The company has operated in Europe for over 20 years, selling switches, antennas and other equipment for wireless networks, as well as consumer devices like smartphones and tablets.
European telecom providers, including Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom, have bought Huawei's gear, which has tended to be cheaper than products from rivals like Ericsson and Nokia. Roughly 23 percent of Huawei's $ 92 billion in revenue last year came from Europe, the Middle East and Africa, up 13 percent from a year earlier.
Huawei built a robust lobbying operation in Europe, hiring influential political and industry figures, as well as donating to charities, universities and other local initiatives. Those efforts have helped the company's standing in the region, with many European governments hesitating to embrace the U.S. effort to stymie sales and remove Huawei equipment from older cellular networks.
A review of 31 European countries shows that Huawei and other Chinese vendors accounted for more than 50 percent of equipment related to high-speed 5G networks at the end of 2022, according to Strand Consult, a telecom-focused research firm. Britain and Sweden have severely restricted Huawei from their newest networks, while Germany has indicated it may tighten its rules against the company's gear. Italy and Spain are among those that have continued buying from Huawei, the firm said.
"The story is how Huawei is navigating the European landscape to try to maintain the position they have," said John Strand, the chief executive of Strand Consult. "They are playing all the cards they can play."
Greece has been a conundrum. It has reliably defended Beijing's interests in the European Union, particularly after the 2008 global financial crisis, when China provided financial aid for projects such as the port of Piraeus, which a Chinese state company now owns. More recently, though, Greece has reoriented itself more toward the West.
The country has also taken a contradictory stance on Huawei. It has not banned the firm's products, but the government and businesses in the country have tried distancing themselves from the Chinese company.
In 2020, Greece joined the Clean Networks initiative, a voluntary and nonbinding agreement to avoid using technology from authoritarian governments, which the Trump administration spearheaded. Greece's three largest wireless network operators have also turned more to Huawei's rivals, Ericsson and Nokia, to build new 5G networks.
Still, Huawei's sales in Greece rose 56 percent last year to 258 million euros ( $ 273 million), according to Greek regulatory filings. The company provided technology for the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation, the state-owned TV and radio broadcaster, as well as the public health care service and the port of Piraeus.
'Ask for Support'
As scrutiny of Huawei increased, the company was on the defensive, according to the messages obtained by The Times.
In 2020, company executives in Greece discussed a letter circulated by European Parliament members that called for a ban of Huawei products. Jacky Chen, a senior executive in the region, asked Theo Tamvakidis, a manager in Greece, to speak with Eva Kaili and Maria Spyraki, two Greek members of the European Parliament.
"Ask for support," Mr. Chen said in a message. "Don't make Huawei trouble in E.U. level if possible."
Mr. Tamvakidis responded, "I think I can still convince her," referring to Ms. Kaili and describing her as a friend he had known for years.
It's unclear if Huawei spoke to the two policymakers. Ms. Kaili was arrested last year as part of a corruption scandal, accused of accepting bribes from Qatar. She has denied wrongdoing.
In an interview, Mr. Tamvakidis said Huawei was constantly "trying to convince people we are not a threat to society, that we are not a public menace."
Ms. Kaili and Ms. Spyraki did not respond to requests for comment.
At other times, Huawei hastened to help Greek government officials with their personal technology, according to the communications.
In July 2021, Mr. Tamvakidis rushed to find a replacement device for an unnamed immigration official who had contacted him about a broken screen on a Mate X, a foldable smartphone that retailed for more than €2,000. Huawei had given it to him as a "present," according to the messages.
"He uses it only for making photos with his Huawei laptop we gave him," Mr. Tamvakidis said in the messages.
Under Greek law, it is illegal for people in the private sector to offer gifts to government officials in exchange for favors. Government ministers, members of Parliament and civil servants also cannot accept gifts that could be considered linked to their official responsibilities, said Stefanos Loukopoulos, director of Vouliwatch, a government watchdog group in Athens.
High-ranking officials can accept certain ceremonial gifts worth less than €200, but more expensive items must be turned over to the government. Declaring gifts is mandatory for Greek ministers under a 2021 law, but the registry has not been made public, Mr. Loukopoulos said.
"Greece has on paper a very solid anti-corruption and anti-bribery framework," he said. But transparency is almost nonexistent, he added, and enforcement of the laws is "very problematic."
'A Special Case'
In 2020, when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo led a U.S. delegation to Greece to complete a technology and science agreement between the countries, Huawei executives discussed having someone present during the negotiations to help remove references to cybersecurity and Chinese companies.
"We discussed with Adonis and took it out," Mr. Tamvakidis wrote to a colleague several months after the summit.
Mr. Tamvakidis was referring to Adonis Georgiadis, a senior Greek minister who sat next to Mr. Pompeo to sign the 2020 agreement in the port city Thessaloniki. Whether Mr. Georgiadis influenced the negotiations in Huawei's favor is unclear, but the company had fostered a relationship with him for years, according to the internal files and public information.
Huawei employees discussed how Mr. Georgiadis, who was the minister of development at the time, received devices from the company while working as a government official. He also posted pictures of his visits to Huawei's offices and events on social media. The nonbinding 2020 agreement signed by Mr. Pompeo and Greek officials, which was aimed at strengthening tech and scientific collaboration, did not ultimately mention cybersecurity or Chinese companies.
Mr. Pompeo declined to comment.
Mr. Georgiadis, who is an ally of Greece's prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said he was not involved in specifics of the tech-science agreement and had no communication with Huawei before it was signed. He said he had been childhood friends with Mr. Tamvakidis and never accepted gifts from Huawei, but bought "two or three" devices for family members with retail receipts. He declined to provide copies of the receipts.
"I never had, or still have, no special relationship with that company," he said in an email. "No agreement, investment, contract, concession or project was rendered to Huawei during my term of office."
Mr. Tamvakidis said he did not recall the specifics of the 2020 agreement but said Huawei might have been "informed that nothing was inside that would be of danger." He did not say who had provided that information.
Mr. Tamvakidis said that he had helped facilitate Huawei devices for Mr. Georgiadis, including for a family member, but that the gadgets had not been offered free. He said the sales were invoiced, but did not provide copies. Government officials sometimes received devices before they were publicly released or at discounted prices, he said.
"There was nothing in exchange," he said. "Huawei is very sensitive about this."
Soon after Mr. Pompeo's visit to Greece, Mr. Georgiadis, who is now the minister of labor, came up again in messages between Huawei officials.
"Adonis needs two more watches. GT Pro. He loved it," Mr. Tamvakidis wrote in October 2020. Later that month, Mr. Georgiadis was photographed wearing what appeared to be a Huawei watch.
In a 2021 exchange, Huawei employees discussed replacing a broken phone for Mr. Georgiadis's son.
"Adonis is a special case," Mr. Tamvakidis wrote.

The Danger of Pulling Too Far Back From China: [Editorial]

Full text: Many Americans, even once-ardent proponents of globalization, have soured on trade with China. But there is a growing danger that as the United States tries to address its difficulties with China, it will pull back too far, severing economic ties that benefit American families and contribute to global peace and prosperity.
The relationship problems are real, and cannot be minimized. Chinese industrial subsidies, often maintained despite promises to the contrary, stripped millions of jobs from America's industrial heartland. Chinese companies flagrantly steal American innovations. China's increasingly confrontational posture toward the United States and its allies -- including the economic support it is providing for Russia's invasion of Ukraine -- have underscored the need for the United States to align trade policy more closely with other aspects of America's national interest. In an example of the prevailing mood in Washington, Representative Mike Gallagher, the Wisconsin Republican who serves as the chairman of the pointedly named "Select Committee on Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party," recently called for broad prohibitions on U.S. investment in China, writing in an essay published in The Washington Post that "we are quite literally funding our own potential destruction."
A new rule book is needed. Too few leaders, however, appear willing to note that Americans also benefit from trade with China, that the two nations are economically intertwined whether they like it or not, and that it is in America's interest for the rest of the world to prosper. Americans bought almost $ 40 billion of Chinese toys, games and sports equipment last year. Soybean farmers in the Upper Midwest sold a record $ 16.4 billion of their beans to China, mostly for pig feed. Intel takes profits from low-end chips it makes and sells in China to fund the high-end chips it sells in America and to its allies. Hundreds of millions of Chinese have come out of poverty thanks to global trade, and have become consumers of U.S. goods and services. Cummins, an engine maker based in Indiana, operates 21 factories in China, and earns a fifth of its profits from its operations there. "Our success in China has led to global success and U.S. job growth," Jon Mills, a spokesman for the company, recently told the Times reporter Alexandra Stevenson.
Amid the harsh talk, the dollar value of American trade with China -- Americans buying Chinese products and the Chinese buying American products -- rose to a record in 2022. The goal of American policymakers ought to be safeguarding the vast majority of those trade flows while addressing the problems that have emerged.
The Biden administration's top priority in its dealings with China is, as it should be, national security. The president has emphasized the need to limit China's access to advanced technologies with military applications. An executive order recently signed by Mr. Biden that restricts American investment in Chinese firms that work on artificial intelligence, semiconductors and quantum computing is a measured and necessary intervention. The government's push to provide subsidies for the domestic production of semiconductors is also a sensible policy. The United States needs to secure reliable access to critical materials.
Hawkish politicians from both parties and American companies that stand to gain from protectionist policies, however, are pushing for a broader retreat from trade with China. Donald Trump, whose dim view of trade helped to propel his successful presidential candidacy in 2016, and who is again the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, is promising to "tax China to build up America." After the Biden administration suspended tariffs on some Chinese solar panels to accelerate America's conversion to renewable energy, Senate Democrats and Republicans joined in a vote to reimpose the tariffs. "This vote was a simple choice: Do you stand with American manufacturers and American workers, or do you stand with China?" said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. Mr. Gallagher's committee, with bipartisan support, has been investigating whether U.S. financial giants like BlackRock and MSCI invested in blacklisted Chinese firms, a warning shot aimed at Wall Street.
The Biden administration describes its approach to trade limitations as "small yard, high fence," meaning that it is aiming to restrict China's access to a small number of advanced technologies. But some strictures on trade, notably the broad tariffs on Chinese imports first introduced by Mr. Trump and maintained by President Biden, already go too far, imposing costs on American households without much benefit to them or national security.
Keeping the yard from getting bigger is also likely to prove difficult. During Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo's recent visit to China, the country's leading mobile phone manufacturer, Huawei, provocatively released a new smartphone powered by an advanced chip made in China most likely using American technology and machinery. A group of House Republicans sent a letter to the Biden administration citing the phone's release as evidence of the need for tighter restrictions on China's access to advanced chips. But China's ability to make serviceable smartphones does not threaten America's national security. Restraint is the best policy here. The United States has a legitimate interest in limiting China's access to military technology, not in preventing the Chinese from checking email.
And while high walls are sometimes essential, so too are broad bridges. It is important to create real penalties for bad behavior by China, but it is also important to reward good behavior. Just as in the United States, there is a debate inside China between trade hard-liners and reformers. America has natural allies among those in China who understand that Beijing has to change and can succeed by playing by the rules.
Defending trade is politically fraught in part because so many American leaders underestimated the impact of China's rise on American workers and failed to ensure that the benefits were broadly shared.
That failure has changed Americans' views of how our country relates to the rest of the world. A recent study reports that younger Americans are more skeptical than previous generations that trade is mutually beneficial for participating nations, part of a broader turn toward zero-sum thinking -- the belief that gains for one group tend to come at someone else's expense. The authors argue that the outlook of older generations was shaped by an era of higher growth, in which it seemed plausible that everyone's boat would rise. Younger generations, by contrast, have been embittered, and policymakers can rebuild support for trade only by addressing those past failures.
The United States can do that by pursuing economic relationships with the world that include protections for the environment and for workers. Other nations will continue to provide industrial subsidies, and the United States can use similar policies to develop new industries, like the renewable energy sector. "We're retaking control of our energy security and our energy future," Ali Zaidi, Mr. Biden's climate adviser, said in an interview with The Times's editorial board. At the same time, America should continue to pursue deeper economic ties with allied nations, as in a recent agreement to allow electric vehicle batteries made with minerals from Japan to qualify for U.S. tax credits.
American engagement with China is complicated by China's contradictions. The country remains eager for access to advanced technologies and global markets, but resists giving reciprocal access to its own markets. In recent months, even as China has ended pandemic restrictions and made a show of reopening its doors, it has made life difficult for foreign firms, with raids on corporate offices, for instance. Some measures, like the refusal of Chinese antitrust authorities to let the American chip maker Intel buy the Israeli chip maker Tower, appear to be responses to U.S. restrictions. But longstanding grievances remain unresolved. It has been 22 years since China promised to let Visa and Mastercard operate on equal terms, and 11 years since the W.T.O. ruled that China wasn't keeping that promise, yet the companies still are struggling for access.
The best reason for optimism is that the two nations still depend on each other. China's recent struggles -- slowing growth, an imploding housing sector, high youth unemployment and capital flight -- appear to be motivating a more open stance among Chinese policymakers. And after a period of escalating tensions, the Biden administration also has sought to calm the waters by sending a series of senior officials to the country. In recent years, Chinese airlines have largely refrained from placing new orders for Boeing airplanes, making a political point of buying jets from Airbus, its European rival. But Guillaume Faury, the Airbus chief executive, predicted in a recent interview that the trend would not continue. "I don't believe that China can rely on one aircraft manufacturer," he said. "They need competition." The first narrow-body jets produced by a Chinese company, Comac, entered commercial service earlier this year. The engines were manufactured in Durham, N.C.
The steadily rising trade between the United States and China from 1979 to the present has disrupted the lives of many Americans and caused real harm to some. That said, in the sweep of history those four decades were an era of remarkable peace between, and prosperity for, the two countries.
Some U.S. politicians want to take advantage of China's dependence to constrain its economic development by denying China the technologies that it needs. The better course is to focus on limiting the reach of China's military, not its economy as a whole. China sees that it cannot isolate itself from the world; this is not the time for the United States to do so, either.

U.S. to Grant $238 Million For Chip Hubs: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The $ 238 million in grants will set up eight research hubs, as a small slice of the federal money that will go to chip companies and research facilities in the coming months.
The Biden administration on Wednesday announced that it was awarding $ 238 million through the Defense Department to set up eight hubs around the United States for promoting innovation in the semiconductor industry.
The funds are one of the earliest releases of the nearly $ 53 billion in grants and subsidies that Congress and the Biden administration have approved to build up the domestic semiconductor industry, which U.S. officials say has been left vulnerable by decades of offshoring.
The Biden administration has a variety of funding programs in the works to encourage chip research institutions and manufacturers to set up operations in the United States. Most of these programs are run through the Commerce Department, and many will begin handing out money this fall.
While U.S. companies still design many of the world's most advanced chips, much of the manufacturing of the technology has been outsourced to foreign locations, including Taiwan, leaving U.S. chip supply vulnerable if, for example, the Chinese government were to invade Taiwan.
The awards announced Wednesday will go to research institutes, consortiums and universities located in New York, Arizona, Indiana, Ohio, California, North Carolina and Massachusetts, defense officials said.
Each hub will receive $ 15 million to $ 40 million to fund the development of new chips for use in electromagnetic warfare, artificial intelligence, 5G and 6G wireless technologies, and quantum computing, among other areas. While the research will be directed at meeting the needs of the Defense Department, it is also expected to be useful for commercial applications.
Kathleen Hicks, the deputy defense secretary, said in a news conference Wednesday that the hubs would "tackle many technical challenges relevant to D.O.D.'s missions, to get the most cutting-edge microchips into systems our troops use every day: ships, planes, tanks, long-range munitions, communications gear, sensors and much more."
The funding also aims to accelerate what the industry refers to as the "lab-to-fab transition," the process of taking new chip technologies and turning them into viable commercial products.
David A. Honey, the deputy under secretary of defense for research and engineering, said the hubs would bring more prototype work to the United States.
"Now we'll be able to get it done here," he said. "And also we're building out in the areas that are just not available anywhere else."
The Commerce Department is separately setting up a string of research hubs for the semiconductor industry, collectively called the National Semiconductor Technology Center, drawing on $ 11 billion in funding it received for research and development.
Appearing before the House Science, Space and Technology Committee on Tuesday, Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, said that her department was on track to formally unveil that technology center this fall.
She also said that the department had received about 100 applications from companies hoping to receive grants that will be available to manufacturers.
While Ms. Raimondo acknowledged that the grant program faced challenges, like securing enough workers to staff new chip plants, she said that if properly implemented, the program would make the United States "the premier destination in the world" for chip design, research and manufacturing.
"That's the vision that we're trying to achieve with your support," Ms. Raimondo told lawmakers.
Ms. Raimondo was also questioned about the release in prior weeks of an advanced smartphone by Chinese telecom giant Huawei. The company is under heavy U.S. trade restrictions, administered by the Commerce Department, that theoretically should have prevented such an innovation.
Ms. Raimondo said that she was upset by the development, but added that the U.S. government did not have any evidence that Chinese companies could manufacture the more sophisticated chips at scale.
Ms. Raimondo said that the United States could take various defensive measures to limit China's access to advanced technology, but "my strongly held view is that what we do on offense matters so much more."
"The reality is that over the past 30 years, this country has taken its eye off the ball of manufacturing," she continued. "And when you don't manufacture you lose out on innovation, and you become dependent on other countries."

China Denies IPhone Curbs, But Cites Flaws: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The comments marked Beijing's first public response to reports that some government agencies have told employees not to use iPhones for work.
China on Wednesday made its first public comments about reports that the government is restricting the use of Apple's iPhones by some state employees, saying that Beijing had noted what it claimed were security concerns about the device.
The comments by Mao Ning, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry, were short on details. She pointed to what she described as "media reports" about security flaws in the iPhone, without elaborating.
She also said China had not published "any law, regulation or policy document" banning the purchase or use of foreign cellphones, including those made by Apple.
The comments come after some employees of government agencies have said they have had been told not to use iPhones for work. Notices issued to government employees and state-owned businesses, calling for usage of domestic brands of cellphones, have also been circulating online. China's usually strict internet censors have yet to delete claims about the restrictions.
The company's stock price initially fell following the reports, which had suggested that Apple could lose ground in China, the world's largest smartphone market.
Calling for curbs on the use of foreign technology by government employees isn't new. China has discouraged officials from adopting foreign cellphones for at least a decade and told government agencies to replace American computer servers and other devices with domestic ones.
The United States has also placed restrictions on China's telecommunications giant, Huawei, and issued controls on exports of advanced U.S. semiconductor technology to China. Some U.S. states have moved to restrict the use of TikTok, the social media app, by government employees.
The White House national security spokesman, John F. Kirby, said on Wednesday that the U.S. government was "watching" the issue and called on China "to be more transparent about what they're seeing and what they're doing."
Any major problems for Apple in China would signal an escalation in the tensions between Beijing and Washington. The American technology giant counts on China for roughly 20 percent of its revenue and much of its manufacturing, which supports hundreds of thousands of local jobs.
Smartphones represent the latest salvo in the U.S.-China tech war after the launch last week of Huawei's Mate 60 Pro. Chinese nationalists celebrated the cellphone's advanced features as a sign that China had developed its own chips, but the device is now the target of a U.S. review into whether it violates the embargo on U.S. semiconductor technology imposed by the Biden administration.
Apple has not said anything publicly about the recent reports. At an event in California on Tuesday, the company unveiled the iPhone 15, its newest model.

An Arrest Fuels Calls to Toughen Britain's Stance on China: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Allegations that a researcher in Parliament was a foreign agent have intensified a fiery debate over Britain's relations with Beijing.
Even by the prolific standards of China's foreign influence operations, it would represent a sensational case of infiltration.
A 28-year-old British man who worked as a researcher deep inside Britain's Parliament was arrested in March on suspicion of working for the Chinese government. The man, who denies being a spy, worked with prominent lawmakers on China policy, raising fears of possible security breaches and widening a rift within the governing Conservative Party over how London should engage with an increasingly assertive Beijing.
"The Chinese are infiltrating across the board; they go for anything and everything," said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London. "What is new is how effective they are, and how far they have managed to go."
The Metropolitan Police said two men were arrested under the Official Secrets Act and were released on bail until October. The men, whose identities were not released by police, have yet to be charged, and lawmakers were asked not to prejudice the investigation by naming them. (News organizations have also not done so, aside from The Sunday Times, which first reported the news of the researcher's arrest on Saturday and has since named him.) Little has been disclosed about the second man, except that he is reported to be in his 30s.
In a statement through a law firm on Monday, the researcher said that he was "completely innocent" and had spent his career "trying to educate others about the challenge and threats presented by the Chinese Communist Party."
If the man is found to have worked for China, the security breach will raise serious questions over how he passed the vetting process to get a job at the heart of one of the most sensitive policy debates in Britain. The man had earlier lived and worked in China, according to The Sunday Times.
The paper said the man may have been recruited there by Chinese agents to return to London with a goal of disrupting the work of the Parliament's China Research Group, a circle of lawmakers who have long warned about China's efforts to influence British universities, think tanks, and government ministries -- and have urged successive British leaders to take a harder line against Beijing.
One of the lawmakers with whom the man had limited contact is Tom Tugendhat, the founder and co-chairman of the China Research Group who now serves as security minister in the government of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Mr. Tugendhat is pressing internally to declare China a threat to Britain's safety and interests -- a cry that has been taken up by China hard-liners outside the government.
"China sees us now as the soft underbelly of the NATO alliance," Iain Duncan Smith, who once served as leader of the Conservative Party, wrote in The Daily Express, a tabloid. "Our policy seems to entail not upsetting China." He called the arrest "a slap in the face of the U.K.'s weak policy on China."
In 2021, China put Mr. Duncan Smith, Mr. Tugendhat and several other individuals and organizations on a blacklist, claiming, among other things, that they had spread lies about human rights abuses in the province of Xinjiang.
Yet for all the hand-wringing and demands for a harder line, analysts said the British government was unlikely to deviate from its current approach, which delicately balances an acknowledgment of China as an "epoch-defining challenge" with a cold-eyed pragmatism about the need to preserve commercial ties.
"U.K. diplomacy toward China has never been particularly ideological, one way or the other," Professor Tsang said. "You've occasional periods of misguided opportunism or reckless rhetoric. But in general, the British are pragmatic."
"China is a reality," he added. "We have to deal with them."
Britain's foreign secretary, James Cleverly, recently visited Beijing, after visits by senior American officials, including Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. British officials are eager for China to send a high-level delegation to a summit meeting later this fall on how to regulate artificial intelligence technology, which is a signature initiative of Mr. Sunak's.
There were signs that other British cabinet ministers were resisting efforts to suspend their diplomatic and commercial outreach.
"China is a country that we do a lot of business with," the business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, said on Sky News on Monday. "China is a country that is significant in terms of world economics. It sits on the U.N. Security Council. We certainly should not be describing China as a foe, but we can describe it as a challenge."
Still, for Mr. Sunak, the revelations are an acute headache. On Sunday, he raised the spying case with China's prime minister, Li Qiang, at the gathering of Group of 20 leaders in New Delhi. Mr. Sunak said he told Mr. Li that he had "very strong concerns about any interference in our parliamentary democracy."
The Chinese government quickly denied the report, calling it "completely fabricated and nothing but malicious slander." A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mao Ning, said her country conducted no espionage inside Britain.
The back-and-forth is unlikely to quell the torrent of questions that followed The Sunday Times's report. And some say the researcher's efforts had tilted the debate over how to deal with China in Britain.
Luke de Pulford, a human rights campaigner and the executive director of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, said the man had successfully discredited people who were critical of the Chinese government with some journalists.
"Privately, he was vicious -- telling journalists that I was 'dangerous' and 'not to be trusted on China,"' Mr. de Pulford said in posts on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. "He was an authoritative and knowledgeable voice -- some people listened. Publicly, he was incredibly clever. He hid behind a visage of 'reasoned hawkishness."'
Britain has struggled to chart a consistent China policy since the Conservative-led government of David Cameron, whose chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, spoke of a "golden decade" of ties between the two countries.
As relations between China and the United States soured, Britain came under pressure from the administration of President Donald J. Trump to take a harder line. Prime Minister Boris Johnson agreed to sharply limit the role of the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei in building the country's 5G network.
In 2020, with Beijing threatening to impose a draconian national security law on Hong Kong, Mr. Johnson pledged to allow nearly three million people from the former British colony to live and work in Britain.
Mr. Johnson's successor, Liz Truss, vowed to take an even tougher approach. Now out of office, Ms. Truss recently visited Taiwan, where she called for the creation of an "economic NATO" to counter China's influence. Mr. Sunak, whose instincts tend to be more pragmatic, has largely avoided the language of Ms. Truss.
But he will face continuing pressure from cases like that of the suspected spy in Parliament. Last July, Parliament's intelligence and security committee issued a report that declared, "Chinese intelligence services target the U.K. and its overseas interests prolifically and aggressively."
The government's "lack of action to protect our assets from a known threat," the report concluded, "was a serious failure, and one from which the U.K. may feel the consequences for years to come."

Full text: For years, officials in China have been told to shun foreign devices. Now reports of renewed curbs have unnerved Apple's investors, heightening geopolitical tensions.
China has discouraged the use of foreign-made electronic devices by government officials for a decade. It has told agencies and state-owned companies to replace American computer servers and other devices with domestic ones. And officials frequently show off to Americans their phones made by Huawei, China's cellphone giant.
Now, some employees of government agencies said they have received directives not to use Apple iPhones for work. Internet users in China also have been circulating accounts and screenshots said to contain notices to government employees and state-owned businesses ordering or urging them to adopt domestic brands of cellphones and computers for their work.
Chinese authorities have issued no public pronouncements about broader restrictions on iPhones. The suggestion that Apple could lose ground in the valuable Chinese market has pushed the company's stock lower, and Apple's most popular product has gotten snared in the persistent China-U.S. tensions over technology.
China's censors, usually assiduous about controlling the flow of information on the internet, appear to have done little or nothing to stop the claims of restrictions, first reported in The Wall Street Journal.
Hu Xijin, the retired editor of a Communist Party-run tabloid and now a nationalistic commentator with 25 million followers, has written about them on his blog. "If this trend continues, the U.S. is likely to be the bigger loser," Mr. Hu wrote on Weibo, a popular Chinese social media site. In a written reply to questions, Mr. Hu said that China has been forced by American policies to show greater "vigilance" about security issues.
On Sunday, President Biden said during a news conference in Vietnam that China's plan to limit government use of "a Western cellphone" was evidence that "China is beginning to change some of the rules of the game in terms of trade and other issues."
Some local and provincial employees, who make up the bulk of government employees in China, have denied being told of any ban. They have been targeted in previous efforts to discourage the use of Apple devices, notably after Edward J. Snowden, an American government contractor, released information in 2013 revealing American surveillance around the world.
The United States and China both have much to lose in a geopolitical fight over consumer electronics.
Apple products are more visible in China than products from Chinese brands like Huawei and Xiaomi are in the United States. But because Apple and many other consumer electronics manufacturers have moved much of their manufacturing to China, one of the largest categories of the American trade deficit with China is in smartphones.
The warnings come right after Huawei introduced a smartphone with high-quality cameras that is seen as an iPhone rival. The Huawei phone, the Mate 60 Pro, is the target of a U.S. review into whether it uses computer chips that were made with American technologies that have been embargoed for sale to China. Huawei has presented the phone as a domestic effort.
Gina Raimondo, the United States commerce secretary, visited Beijing and Shanghai last month and told Chinese officials that the United States would not pull back recent controls it placed on certain high-tech exports to China.
Duncan Clark, a specialist in China's telecom sector and now the chairman of BDA China, an investment consulting firm, said he believed the restrictions were "an effort to raise the stakes and remind the U.S. of what it could lose" from continued geopolitical frictions.
Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor emeritus at Hong Kong Baptist University, had a similar assessment. "I think it's a tit-for-tat reaction," he said, to American efforts to discourage foreign governments from installing Huawei equipment in their telecom sectors, as well as moves by some U.S. states to restrict the use of TikTok, the social media app, by government employees.
The United States bans federal agencies from buying telecommunications equipment from Huawei and other Chinese manufacturers.
Mr. Cabestan said that the warnings in China appeared to be a security measure aimed at state employees, and not a broader effort to discourage sales in China of Apple devices.
Still, few American companies have more to lose than Apple from rising tensions between the world's superpowers. China is the world's largest smartphone market and the source of about a fifth of Apple's revenue. Apple doesn't break out how many iPhones it sells in China.
More broadly, Apple became the most valuable technology company by pioneering a business model built on China's manufacturing expertise. The country's giant work force inexpensively assembles the vast majority of iPhones sold around the world.
On Tuesday in California, Apple will reveal its newest iPhone at a highly choreographed event that is an annual rite in Silicon Valley, and the company will then start stocking its stores around the world with the new model. Increasing official Chinese resistance to iPhones has the potential to curb this year's sales.
Apple, which didn't respond to requests for comment, has not said anything publicly about the recent reports.
The iPhone has long been a status symbol among Chinese entrepreneurs and popular among consumers, particularly in cities. By contrast, government employees have made a point of showing off their Huawei phones in public settings.
Under pressure from the Chinese government, Apple has built an extensive data center in China, although it has said it continues to protect its customers' privacy all over the world.
Some people who work in China's central government said employees have been told to stop using iPhones. Others described a vaguer demand for officials to stop using foreign-brand phones and to use Chinese ones.
One message that circulated on WeChat, a ubiquitous Chinese social media service, cited a decision from a departmental leader that staff members were to be barred from using foreign-brand smartphones, laptops and other digital devices starting Sept. 7. The message said staff members were also prohibited from using these foreign-brand products for work in their own homes. Another message on WeChat said that staff members would be required to stop using iPhones by Oct. 1.
Discussion has appeared online for years about whether Chinese officials are barred from using iPhones, along with occasional denials of blanket bans. A Shanghai newspaper reported in 2014 that officials in that city were under pressure to abandon iPhones over security worries.
A researcher in a government-run research institute in Beijing, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the drive to discourage the use of iPhones appeared to ripple from what Chinese officials and party newspapers have described as a strategy of "substitution for domestic products" in key technologies, which has picked up pace since last year. In a speech to senior officials in February, which was published in July, Xi Jinping, China's leader, urged increased efforts to achieve self-sufficiency for China in scientific research and advanced technologies.
"We must go on the offensive for the national production of scientific and technological instruments and equipment, operating systems and basic software," Mr. Xi said.
In recent weeks, China's Minister of State Security has publicized cases that it said involved Chinese officials and other people in sensitive roles being recruited by U.S. intelligence agents. Earlier this year, Chinese government secrecy authorities warned about careless use of phones that could expose officials to hacking or leaking sensitive information.

Full text: There's a general rule about consumer electronics: The older a device becomes, the more competitors appear and prices fall. This was true for televisions, personal computers and portable music players.
It was supposed to happen with smartphones. But the iPhone has defied gravity.
On Tuesday, Apple will unveil the 17th iteration of its flagship product. Remarkably, at an age in which most consumer devices have lost some of their appeal to users, Apple has increased its share of smartphone sales over less expensive rivals.
Over the past five years, the iPhone has increased its percentage of total smartphones sold around the world while expanding its share of sales in four of the world's largest regions: China, Japan, Europe and India.
In the United States, the iPhone's largest market, the device now accounts for more than 50 percent of smartphones sold, up from 41 percent in 2018, according to Counterpoint Research, a technology firm. The gains have helped it claim about a fifth of the world's smartphone sales, up from a low of 13 percent in 2019.
Apple has expanded its smartphone empire as the broader industry has faltered. Over the past two years, sales of Android smartphones have plummeted, but the iPhone has suffered only modest declines because it's been winning new customers. It has done so despite being the industry's priciest device.
Apple has overcome price sensitivity by creating a business that is reminiscent of U.S. car sales. Like a car, iPhones last for years and can be resold to offset the purchase of a new one. Wireless providers, much like auto dealers, offer discounts and monthly payment plans that make it more affordable to buy the latest model. And customers, like brand-loyal car buyers, are more likely to buy another iPhone than switch to Google's Android operating system.
Apple has also been lucky. Two of its biggest challengers, Samsung and Huawei, have stumbled in recent years. Samsung faltered in 2016 when the batteries in its flagship smartphone spontaneously combusted. Huawei, which was popular in China, floundered in 2020 after the Trump administration blocked it from buying U.S. technology.
The iPhone has avoided wobbles with a reliable blueprint: Apple annually updates the iPhone's spare but sleek design and reliable software, and brings it to the masses with an operations machine that assembles 200 million flawless iPhones a year with military precision.
In the United States, the iPhone's popularity is expected to widen in the years ahead. Nearly 90 percent of teenagers own an iPhone, according to Piper Sandler, an investment bank.
For young people, iPhones equal inclusion. Many choose it over Android because Apple's messaging service, iMessage, will turn the color of messages from its default blue to green if a non-iPhone user is in a messaging group. The stigma associated with having green text messages is so pronounced that when it came time for Dave Storrs's 14-year-old son to get his first smartphone, the teenager told his father that he wanted an iPhone or no phone at all.
"It's a status thing," said Mr. Storrs, an Army retiree who lives in El Paso. "They don't want to be treated differently."
Mr. Storrs, who is 49, has been subjected to the same pressure. For more than a decade, he took pride in being what he called an "Android renegade." He owned a series of LG and Motorola phones, even as his son and other family members pressed him to buy an iPhone. He gave in this year after his family gave him a $ 99 pair of Apple's wireless AirPod earbuds.
Each time he wanted to use the AirPods on his Android phone, he had to manually sync them. The laborious process inspired him to buy an iPhone 13, which connects the AirPods instantaneously. After years of using a free Android phone, he now pays $ 11 a month for the iPhone. But he says that he'll never go back to Android because he likes that he can wear AirPods and take phone calls while walking his Catahoula leopard dog, Teddy.
"It's just convenient," he said.
New buyers like Mr. Storrs illustrate how Apple is gaining customers. The gap between the two major operating systems is tilted in Apple's favor. About 94 percent of iPhone customers are likely to buy another iPhone, while 91 percent of Android customers are likely to buy another Android, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, a technology research firm.
The migration from Android to Apple has accelerated as promotional discounts, financing plans and trade-in offers make higher iPhone prices less of a barrier. Wireless carriers sweetened their offers as they scrambled to gain or keep customers after T-Mobile merged with Sprint in 2020. When the combined company, the new T-Mobile, offered the iPhone 12 free with a 30-month contract, AT&T countered with a similar deal, said Cliff Maldonado of BayStreet Research, a smartphone research firm. It made switching painless.
Around the same time, Apple and wireless carriers began more aggressively promoting monthly payment plans. The plans have reduced the cost of a new iPhone to less than $ 40 a month from the $ 800 to $ 1,200 that customers had to pay upfront. The prices are lower for people who trade in used devices. The old iPhones, which could fetch up to $ 640, have been auctioned to buyers in Asia, who resell them at a markup, Mr. Maldonado said.
"The phone market is like the housing market," he said. "You get equity, and pay over time."
In China, the second-most important country to Apple's business, the iPhone has become the default choice for people who want a premium smartphone. Samsung was squeezed out of the market several years ago, and Huawei has been unable to make a phone with the latest wireless technology. The lack of competition has helped to make the iPhone the country's best-selling smartphone in recent quarters.
But new challenges threaten Apple's lead. Last month, Huawei unveiled a new premium smartphone, the Mate 60 Pro, its first to feature chips capable of running on 5G cellular networks. Beijing also directed employees of national government agencies not to use iPhones for work. Instead, they have been encouraged to use domestic smartphone brands, raising the possibility that nationalist momentum undercuts future iPhone sales. The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.
Apple didn't respond to requests for comment.
Apple may be able to offset a dip in China with growth in India. The company now claims 5 percent of sales in the world's fastest-growing smartphone nation, up from 1 percent in 2019. Counterpoint Research predicts that Apple could double its share to 10 percent next year.
The iPhone's gains in India have been years in the making. In 2017, Apple began working with government officials to start manufacturing iPhones locally, a move that has improved affordability by avoiding import tariffs. It has also opened stores in New Delhi and Mumbai.
The new flagship iPhones that Apple is set to unveil this week will feature speedier processors, more sophisticated cameras and titanium rather than stainless steel cases, according to supply chain analysts. The changes are expected to come with a $ 100 to $ 200 price increase, bringing the cost of an iPhone Pro to $ 1,100 and the Pro Max to $ 1,200.
But analysts predict that iPhone loyalists will shrug off higher prices. The increases would be less than $ 5 a month for people on monthly plans and even less for those who trade in old iPhones.
"The economy is doing pretty well, and everything costs more," said Michael Levin, a co-founder of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. "People are desensitized to increases right now."

China has discouraged the use of foreign-made electronic devices by government officials for a decade. It has told agencies and state-owned companies to replace American computer servers and other devices with domestic ones. And officials frequently show off to Americans their phones made by Huawei, China’s cellphone giant.
Now, some employees of government agencies said they have received directives not to use Apple iPhones for work. Internet users in China also have been circulating accounts and screenshots said to contain notices to government employees and state-owned businesses ordering or urging them to adopt domestic brands of cellphones and computers for their work.

China Flexes Tech Muscles By Unveiling A New Phone: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The release of a homegrown Chinese smartphone during a visit by the Biden official in charge of regulating such technology shows the U.S.-China tech conflict is alive and well.
In the midst of the U.S. commerce secretary's good will tour to China last week, Huawei, the telecom giant that faces stiff U.S. trade restrictions, unveiled a smartphone that illustrated just how hard it has been for the United States to clamp down on China's tech prowess.
The new phone is powered by a chip that appears to be the most advanced version of China's homegrown technology to date -- a kind of achievement that the United States has been trying to prevent China from reaching.
The timing of its release may not have been a coincidence. The Commerce Department has been leading U.S. efforts to curb Beijing's ability to gain access to advanced chips, and the commerce secretary, Gina M. Raimondo, spent much of her trip defending the U.S. crackdown to Chinese officials, who pressed her to water down some of the rules.
Ms. Raimondo's powerful role -- as well as China's antipathy toward the U.S. curbs -- was reflected online, where more than a dozen vendors cropped up on Chinese e-commerce sites to sell phone cases for the new model with Ms. Raimondo's face imprinted on the back. Doctored images showed Ms. Raimondo holding the new phone, next to phrases like "I am Raimondo, this time I endorse Huawei" and "Huawei mobile phone ambassador Raimondo."
Chinese media have referred to the phone as a sign of the country's technological independence, but U.S. analysts said the achievement still most likely hinged on the use of American technology and machinery, which would have been in violation of U.S. trade restrictions.
Beginning in the Trump administration and continuing under President Biden, the United States has steadily ramped up its restrictions on selling advanced chips and the machinery needed to make them to China, and to Huawei in particular, in an attempt to shut down China's mastery of technologies that could aid its military.
For the past several years, those restrictions have curtailed Huawei's ability to produce 5G phones. But Huawei appears to have found a way around those restrictions to make an advanced phone, at least in limited quantities. Though detailed information about the phone is limited, Huawei's jade-green Mate 60 Pro appears to have many of the same basic capabilities as other smartphones on the market.
An examination of the phone by TechInsights, a Canadian firm that analyzes the semiconductor industry, concluded that the advanced chip inside was manufactured by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation of China and was operating beyond the technology limits that the United States has been trying to enforce.
Douglas Fuller, an associate professor at Copenhagen Business School, said SMIC appeared to have used equipment stockpiled before restrictions went into effect, equipment licensed to it for the purpose of producing chips for companies other than Huawei, and spare parts acquired through third-party vendors to cobble together its production.
"The official line in China of a heroic breaking of the technology blockade of the American imperialists is incorrect," Mr. Fuller said. "Instead, the U.S. has allowed SMIC continued significant access to American technology."
Huawei and SMIC did not respond to a request for comment. The Commerce Department also did not respond to a request for comment.
Chinese social media commentators and news sites celebrated the smartphone's release as evidence that U.S. restrictions could not hold China back from developing its own technology.
"Regardless of Huawei's intentions, the launch of the Mate 60 Pro has been imbued by many Chinese netizens with a deeper meaning of 'rising up under US pressure,"' the state-run Global Times said in an editorial.
The phone was released during a week when both American and Chinese officials had issued numerous statements about renewed cooperation and communication. Chinese officials had asked for the United States to roll back its restrictions on chip exports. But Ms. Raimondo -- whose email, along with other U.S. officials, was targeted this year by Chinese hackers -- told reporters that she had taken a hard line on the technology controls in her meetings, saying the United States was not willing to remove restrictions or compromise on issues of national security.
During the trip, Ms. Raimondo and her advisers set up a dialogue to share information about how the United States was enforcing its technology controls. She said the step would lead to better Chinese compliance but was not an invitation to the Chinese to try to water down export controls.
Ms. Raimondo also met directly with the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, during her visit. The week before, Mr. Li had visited Huawei during a visit to southern China, according to the official Xinhua News Agency, and met with the company founder Ren Zhengfei.
The release of the Huawei phone raises questions about whether Ms. Raimondo's department will continue trying to build good will with Chinese officials -- or potentially take a more aggressive stance toward cracking down on China's access to American technology.
The Biden administration is preparing to issue a final version of the technology restrictions it first put out last October, and the revised rules could come within weeks.
Huawei's development of the phone does not necessarily demonstrate a huge leap forward for Chinese technological prowess -- or the total failure of U.S. export controls, analysts said.
Because Chinese firms no longer have access to the most cutting-edge machines for making semiconductors, they have developed novel workarounds that use older machinery to create more powerful chips. But these methods are both relatively time-consuming for manufacturers, and produce a higher proportion of faulty chips, limiting the scale of production.
"This does not mean China can manufacture advanced semiconductors at scale," said Paul Triolo, an associate partner for China and technology policy at Albright Stonebridge Group, a consultancy. "But it shows what incentives U.S. controls have created for Chinese firms to collaborate and attempt new ways to innovate with their existing capabilities."
"It is the first major salvo in what will be a decade or more struggle for China's semiconductor industry to essentially reinvent parts of the global semiconductor supply chain without U.S. technology included," he added.
Nazak Nikakhtar, a partner at Wiley Rein and a former Commerce Department official, said Huawei's progress was "a result of longstanding U.S. policy" -- specifically U.S. licenses that allow companies to continue selling advanced technologies to firms that the Commerce Department placed on a so-called entity list, like Huawei and SMIC.
From Jan. 3 to March 31, 2022, the Commerce Department approved licenses for the sale of $ 23 billion of tech products to companies on the entity list, according to information released in February by the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
"Where gaps exist in licensing policies, exports will get funneled through the gaps," Ms. Nikakhtar said. "The U.S. government needs to close the gaps if its intention is to limit exports of critical technologies to China."
In a statement on Wednesday, Representative Mike Gallagher, a Wisconsin Republican who heads a congressional committee on China, called for ending all U.S. technology exports to both Huawei and SMIC. U.S. chip makers such as Qualcomm and Intel have received exporting licenses.

Raimondo Heads to China To Push Trade, and Curb It: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The commerce secretary's trip may be the clearest demonstration yet of the balancing act the Biden administration is trying to pull off in its relations with China.
Gina Raimondo, the secretary of commerce, is heading to China on Saturday with two seemingly contradictory responsibilities: a mandate to strengthen U.S. business relations with Beijing while also imposing some of the toughest Chinese trade restrictions in years.
The head of the Commerce Department is traditionally the government's biggest champion for the business community both at home and abroad, promoting the kind of extensive ties U.S. firms have with China, the world's second-largest economy.
But U.S.-China relations have turned chillier as China has become more aggressive in flexing its economic and military might. While China remains an important economic partner, American officials have increasingly viewed the country as a security threat and have imposed a raft of new restrictions aimed at crippling Beijing's access to technology that could be used to strengthen the Chinese military or security services.
The bulk of those restrictions -- which have stoked anger and irritation from the Chinese government -- have been imposed by Ms. Raimondo's agency.
The Commerce Department has issued extensive trade restrictions on sales of chips, software and machinery to China's semiconductor industry and is mulling an expansion of those rules that could be issued soon after Ms. Raimondo returns to Washington.
Her visit could be the biggest test yet of whether the Biden administration can pull off the balancing act of promoting economic ties with China while clamping down on some trade in the interest of national security.
Ms. Raimondo will be the fourth administration official to travel to China in recent months, following John Kerry, the president's special envoy for climate change; Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen; and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken.
Ms. Raimondo is expected to reiterate what her counterparts have told Chinese officials: that there is no contradiction between the administration's goals for encouraging commercial engagement with China and protecting U.S. national security. They argue that the United States can maintain economic ties with China that benefit both countries and encourage peace, while also setting narrow but tough restrictions on China's access to advanced technology in the interest of national defense.
But the approach faces skepticism in both countries. In the United States, some Republicans argue that even more innocuous business ties with China could undercut U.S. industries and leave the nation vulnerable to influence from Beijing. And in China, many view what the U.S. government describes as narrow, national-security-related actions as a poorly disguised effort to hold back the Chinese economy.
"I think the Commerce Department has tried to be very targeted," said Samm Sacks, a senior fellow at Yale Law School's Paul Tsai China Center. "Now, the Chinese side won't see it that way."
For Chinese officials, Ms. Raimondo simultaneously represents some of their best opportunities for engagement with the United States and their biggest source of frustration.
Experts say her visit presents a chance for Chinese leaders to strengthen trade relations and signal that their country is still open to international business at a moment when the Chinese economy has stumbled, foreign investment has declined and a series of raids on companies with foreign ties have set executives on edge.
But Chinese officials have also harshly criticized the technology curbs issued by her department, a condemnation they are likely to repeat in the week ahead. Officials in Beijing have also been highly critical of the new restrictions on American investment in certain high-tech Chinese industries, which the Biden administration proposed earlier this month.
At a summit in South Africa this week, a Chinese official delivered a prepared statement from Chinese leader Xi Jinping that called for the world to avoid "the abyss of a new Cold War" and blamed "some country, obsessed with maintaining its hegemony" for working to cripple emerging markets and developing countries.
In addition to export controls, Ms. Raimondo is overseeing the distribution of $ 50 billion to chip companies that build facilities in the United States. Any company that accepts that funding must agree not to build new factories for making advanced chips in China for at least a decade.
"The Biden administration is probing for a way to engage the Chinese in a very difficult environment," said Myron Brilliant, a senior counselor at Dentons Global Advisors-ASG who was formerly the executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "It's a balancing act for sure, between the national security agenda they are enforcing, while also recognizing that a lot of trade between the countries doesn't touch on national security considerations and should therefore not be restricted."
Ms. Raimondo is set to meet with high-level Chinese officials and representatives of American businesses in Beijing and Shanghai between Monday and Wednesday. People familiar with the government's planning say those talks may result in the creation of working groups to discuss export controls and commercial issues that arise between China and the United States.
American businesses are also hoping that the Biden administration will push for additional intellectual property protections for pharmaceutical companies, more access to the Chinese market for Visa and Mastercard and the completion of a longstanding Chinese order of Boeing airplanes, among other goals, people familiar with the talks said.
But those gains, while important for American firms, would still seem trivial compared with the mounting pressures U.S. companies can now face in China.
China's sputtering economy and harsh lockdowns during the pandemic are giving pause to businesses considering their presence in the country. The Chinese government has also restricted companies sending data from China abroad, making it more difficult for multinationals to do business.
Chinese authorities have responded to increasing technology restrictions from the United States by barring the U.S. chip-maker Micron from sales to companies that handle critical Chinese information and by scuttling a proposed merger between Intel and an Israeli chip-maker with operations in China. And companies exporting from China still face nearly the full suite of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, in addition to the new export controls.
The Biden administration has acknowledged the tensions in the U.S.-China relationship, saying that China poses a threat to U.S. national security but that it is still one of the country's most integral economic partners.
"This isn't about, you know, holding China back or denying them commodity technology," Ms. Raimondo said of the export controls at an event at the American Enterprise Institute in July. "Certainly not about denying U.S. companies revenue. It's about being honest about the fact that China has a military civil fusion strategy, which includes getting our most sophisticated technology and using it to advance their military. And we're not going to allow that."
The United States has for decades imposed export controls on the types of technology that can be sent to China, including restricting sales of satellites and other technology following Beijing's crackdown in Tiananmen Square in 1989.
But limits on technology trade with China have increased substantially in recent years, since the Trump administration imposed restrictions on the Chinese telecom firm Huawei. In October, the Biden administration expanded the limits to all firms using advanced chips in China.
Chip firms, which earn a third or more of their global revenue through sales to China, have also pushed back, saying that the new restrictions are resulting in less money to invest in new research and innovation.In July, the chief executives of Nvidia, Qualcomm and Intel met with Ms. Raimondo in Washington to make that case.
It's not clear how much influence, if any, their lobbying will have on the rules. Ms. Raimondo, a former venture capitalist and governor of Rhode Island, has a long reputation as a business-friendly and pragmatic political actor. But as commerce secretary, she has repeatedly argued that the United States could not compromise on issues of national security.
"We are not seeking the decoupling of our economy from that of China's," Ms. Raimondo said in a speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in November. "We want to continue to promote trade and investment in those areas that do not undermine our interests or values."

Biden's Order Bans Investing In Chinese Tech: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The new limits, aimed at preventing American help to Beijing as it modernizes its military, escalate a conflict between the world's two largest economies.
President Biden escalated his confrontation with China on Wednesday by signing an executive order banning new American investment in key technology industries that could be used to enhance Beijing's military capabilities, the latest in a series of moves putting more distance between the world's two largest economies.
The order will prohibit venture capital and private equity firms from pumping more money into Chinese efforts to develop semiconductors and other microelectronics, quantum computers and certain artificial intelligence applications. Administration officials stressed that the move was tailored to guard national security, but China is likely to see it as part of a wider campaign to contain its rise.
"The Biden administration is committed to keeping America safe and defending America's national security through appropriately protecting technologies that are critical to the next generation of military innovation," the Treasury Department said in a statement. The statement emphasized that the executive order was a "narrowly targeted action" complementing existing export controls and that the administration maintained its "longstanding commitment to open investment."
Narrow or not, the new order comes at perhaps the most fraught moment in the U.S.-China relationship since President Richard M. Nixon and Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger opened a dialogue with Beijing in the early 1970s. A series of expanding export controls on key technologies to China has already triggered retaliation from Beijing, which recently announced the cutoff of metals like gallium that are critical for the Pentagon's own supply chain.
Mr. Biden has stressed that he wants to stabilize relations with China following a Cold War-style standoff over a spy balloon shot down after crossing through American airspace and the discovery of a broad Chinese effort to put malware into power grids and communications systems. He has sent Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen and other officials to renew talks with Chinese officials in recent months. Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, is expected to go to China in coming weeks.
Indeed, the president seemed intent on not antagonizing Beijing with Wednesday's order, making no comment about his action and leaving it to be announced through written material and background briefings by aides who declined to be identified.
Still, China declared that it was "very disappointed" by the order, which it said was designed to "politicize and weaponize trade," and it hinted at retaliation.
"The latest investment restrictions will seriously undermine the interests of Chinese and American companies and investors, hinder the normal business cooperation between the two countries and lower the confidence of the international community in the U.S. business environment," Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese embassy, said in a statement.
Administration officials said the president's order is part of their effort to "de-risk" the relationship with China but not to "decouple" from it. Wednesday's announcement, though, takes that effort to a new level. While export bans and concerns about Chinese investment in the United States have a long history, the United States has never before attempted such limits on the flow of investment into China.
In fact, for the past few decades, the United States has encouraged American investors to deepen their ties in the Chinese economy, viewing that as a way to expand the web of interdependencies between the two countries that would gradually integrate Beijing into the Western economy and force it to play by Western rules.
U.S. government reviews in recent years, however, concluded that investments in new technologies and joint ventures were fueling China's military and its intelligence-collection capabilities, even if indirectly. American officials have been actively sharing intelligence reports with allies to make the case that Western investment is key to China's military modernization plans -- especially in space, cyberspace and the kind of computer power that would be needed to break Western encryption of critical communications.
Administration officials cast the effort as one motivated entirely by national security concerns, not an attempt to gain economic advantage. But the order itself describes how difficult it is to separate the two, referring to China's moves to "eliminate barriers between civilian and commercial sectors and military and defense industrial sectors." It describes China's focus on "acquiring and diverting the world's cutting-edge technologies, for the purpose of achieving military dominance."
(The text of Mr. Biden's order refers only to "countries of concern," though an annex limits those to "the People's Republic of China" and its two special administrative areas, Hong Kong and Macau.)
Mr. Biden and his aides discussed joint efforts to limit high-tech investment with their counterparts at the recent Group of 7 summit meeting in Hiroshima, Japan. Several allies, including Britain and the European Union, have publicly indicated that they may follow suit. The outreach to other powers underscores that a U.S. ban may not be that effective by itself and would work only in conjunction with other major nations, including Japan and South Korea.
The executive order, which also requires firms to notify the government of certain investments, coincides with a bipartisan effort in Congress to impose similar limits. An amendment along those lines by Senators Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, and John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, was added to the Senate version of the annual defense authorization bill.
Several Republicans criticized the president's order as too little, too late and "riddled with loopholes," as Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, put it.
"It is long overdue, but the Biden administration finally recognized there is a serious problem with U.S. dollars funding China's rise at our expense," Mr. Rubio said. "However, this narrowly tailored proposal is almost laughable."
Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, said the new order should go after existing investments as well as sectors like biotechnology and energy.
"We need to stop the flow of American dollars and know-how supporting" China's military and surveillance apparatus "rather than solely pursuing half measures that are taking too long to develop and go into effect," Mr. McCaul said.
The United States already prohibits or restricts the export of certain technologies and products to China. The new order effectively means that American money, expertise and prestige cannot be used to help China to develop its own versions of what it cannot buy from American companies.
It was unclear how much money would be affected. American investors have already pulled back dramatically over the past two years. Venture capital investment in China has plummeted from a high of $ 43.8 billion in the last quarter of 2021 to $ 10.5 billion in the second quarter of this year, according to PitchBook, which tracks such trends. But the latest order could have a chilling effect on investment beyond the specific industries at stake.
In a capital where the goal of opposing China is one of the few areas of bipartisan agreement, the only sounds of caution in Washington came from the business community. While trade groups praised the administration for consulting them, there was concern that the downward spiral in relations could speed a broader break between the world's two largest economies.
"We hope the final rules allow U.S. chip firms to compete on a level playing field and access key global markets, including China, to promote the long-term strength of the U.S. semiconductor industry and our ability to out-innovate global competitors," the Semiconductor Industry Association said in a statement.
Gabriel Wildau, a managing director at the consulting firm Teneo who focuses on political risk in China, said the direct effect of the executive order would be modest, given its limited scope, but that disclosure requirements embedded in the order could have a chilling effect.
"Politicians increasingly regard corporate investments in China as a form of collusion with a foreign enemy, even when there is no allegation of illegality," he said.
The Treasury Department, which has already consulted with American executives about the forthcoming order, will begin formally taking comments before drafting rules to be put in place next year. But American firms may alter their investment strategies even before the rules take effect, knowing that they are coming.
China's own investment restrictions are broader than the new American rules -- they apply to all outbound investments, not just those in the United States. And they reflect a technology policy that in some ways is the opposite of the new American restrictions.
China discouraged or halted most low-tech outbound investments, like purchases of real estate or even European soccer clubs. But China allowed and even encouraged further acquisitions of businesses with technologies that could offer geopolitical advantages, including investments in overseas businesses involved in aircraft production, robotics, artificial intelligence and heavy manufacturing.
The latest move from Washington comes at a rare moment of vulnerability for the Chinese economy. Consumer prices in China, after barely rising for the previous several months, fell in July for the first time in more than two years, the country's National Bureau of Statistics announced on Wednesday.
While Chinese cities and some businesses have declared 2023 a "Year ›of Investing in China" in hopes of a post-Covid revival of their local economies, President Xi Jinping has created an environment that has made many American venture capital firms and other investors more cautious.
Western companies that assess investment risk, like the Mintz Group, have been investigated and in some cases their offices have been raided. A Japanese executive was accused of espionage, and a new anti-espionage law has raised fears that ordinary business activities would be viewed by China as spying.
The Biden administration's previous moves to restrain sensitive economic relationships have taken a toll. China's telecommunications champion, Huawei, has been almost completely blocked from the U.S. market, and American allies, starting with Australia, are ripping Huawei equipment out of their networks. China Telecom was banned by the Federal Communications Commission, which said it "is subject to exploitation, influence and control by the Chinese government."
At the same time, the United States -- with the somewhat reluctant help of the Dutch government, Japan and South Korea -- has gone to extraordinary lengths to prevent China from building up its own domestic capability to manufacture the most high-end microelectronics by itself.
Washington has banned the export of the multimillion-dollar lithography equipment used to produce chips in hopes of limiting China's progress while the United States tries to restore its own semiconductor industry. Taken together, it is an unprecedented effort to slow an adversary's capabilities while speeding America's own investment.

China discouraged or halted most low-tech outbound investments, such as purchases of real estate or even European soccer clubs. But China allowed and even encouraged further acquisitions of businesses with technologies that could offer geopolitical advantages, including investments in overseas businesses involved in aircraft production, robotics, artificial intelligence and heavy manufacturing.
The latest move from Washington comes at a rare moment of vulnerability for the Chinese economy. Consumer prices in China, after barely rising for the previous several months, fell in July for the first time in more than two years, the country’s National Bureau of Statistics announced Wednesday.
Chinese cities and some businesses have declared 2023 a “Year of Investing in China” in hopes of a post-COVID revival of their local economies. President Xi Jinping has created an environment that has made many American venture capital firms and other investors more cautious.
Western companies that assess investment risk, including the Mintz Group, have been investigated and in some cases their offices have been raided. A Japanese executive was accused of espionage, and a new anti-espionage law has raised fears that ordinary business activities would be viewed by China as spying.
The Biden administration’s previous moves to restrain sensitive economic relationships have taken a toll. China’s telecommunications champion, Huawei, has been almost completely blocked from the U.S. market, and U.S. allies, starting with Australia, are ripping Huawei equipment out of their networks. China Telecom was banned by the Federal Communications Commission, which said it “is subject to exploitation, influence and control by the Chinese government.”
At the same time, the United States — with the somewhat reluctant help of the Netherlands, Japan and South Korea — has gone to extraordinary lengths to prevent China from building up its own domestic capability to manufacture the most high-end microelectronics by itself.
Washington has banned the export of the multimillion-dollar lithography equipment used to produce chips in hopes of limiting China’s progress while the United States tries to restore its own semiconductor industry. Taken together, it is an unprecedented effort to slow an adversary’s capabilities while speeding America’s own investment.

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden escalated his confrontation with China on Wednesday by signing an executive order banning American investments in key technology industries that could be used to enhance Beijing’s military capabilities, the latest in a series of moves putting further distance between the world’s two largest economies.
The order will prohibit venture capital and private equity firms from pumping money into Chinese efforts to develop semiconductors and other microelectronics, quantum computers and certain artificial intelligence applications. Administration officials stressed that the move was tailored to guard national security, but China is likely to see it as part of a wider campaign to contain its rise.
“The Biden administration is committed to keeping America safe and defending America’s national security through appropriately protecting technologies that are critical to the next generation of military innovation,” the Treasury Department said in a statement. The statement emphasized that the executive order was a “narrowly targeted action” complementing existing export controls and that the administration maintained its “longstanding commitment to open investment.”
Narrow or not, the new order comes at perhaps the most fraught moment in the U.S.-China relationship since President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger opened a dialogue with Beijing in the early 1970s. A series of expanding export controls on key technologies to China has already triggered retaliation from Beijing, which recently announced the cutoff of metals including gallium that are critical for the Pentagon’s own supply chain.
Biden has stressed that he wants to stabilize relations with China following a Cold War-style standoff over a spy balloon shot down after crossing through U.S. airspace and the discovery of a broad Chinese effort to put malware into power grids and communications systems. He has sent Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other officials to reopen communications in recent months. Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, is expected to go to China in coming weeks.
Administration officials have argued that they have been acting with a prudence that should have been exercised around key technologies years ago.
But Wednesday’s announcement takes that effort to a new level. While export bans and concerns about Chinese investment in the United States have a long history, the United States has never before attempted broad limits on the flow of investment into China.
In fact, for much of the past few decades, the United States has encouraged American investors to deepen their ties in the Chinese economy, viewing that as a way to expand the web of interdependencies between the two countries that would gradually integrate Beijing into the Western economy and force it to play by Western rules.
Reviews over the past few years, however, concluded that investments in new technologies and joint ventures were fueling China’s military and its intelligence-collection capabilities, even if indirectly. U.S. officials have been actively sharing intelligence reports with allies to make the case that Western investment is key to China’s military modernization plans — especially in space, cyberspace and the kind of computer power that would be needed to break Western encryption of critical communications.
Biden’s delegation discussed joint efforts to limit high-tech investment with its counterparts at the recent Group of 7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan. Several allies, including Britain and the European Union, have publicly indicated that they may follow suit. The outreach to other powers underscores that a U.S. ban may not be that effective by itself and would work only in conjunction with other major nations, including Japan and South Korea.
The executive order coincides with a bipartisan effort in Congress to impose similar limits. An amendment along those lines by Sens. Bob Casey, D-Pa., and John Cornyn, R-Texas, was added to the Senate version of the annual defense authorization bill. Administration officials said they would try to align their upcoming rules with the congressional framework.
Industry officials responded cautiously to the new order.
“We hope the final rules allow U.S. chip firms to compete on a level playing field and access key global markets, including China, to promote the long-term strength of the U.S. semiconductor industry and our ability to out-innovate global competitors,” the Semiconductor Industry Association said in a statement.
Gabriel Wildau, a managing director at the consulting firm Teneo who focuses on political risk in China, said the direct effect of the executive order would be modest, given its limited scope, but that disclosure requirements embedded in the order could have a chilling effect.
“Politicians increasingly regard corporate investments in China as a form of collusion with a foreign enemy, even when there is no allegation of illegality,” he said.
The Treasury Department, which has already consulted with American executives about the forthcoming order, will begin a process of formally taking comments before drafting rules to be put in place next year. But U.S. firms may alter their investment strategies even before the rules take effect, knowing that they are coming.
China’s government is almost certain to criticize Biden’s order, although the full response might be a little slow in coming. The foreign ministry is not holding its usual daily news conferences in Beijing this week, as many from the Chinese leadership have headed to the country’s Beidaihe beach resort for their usual summer retreat and discussions of policy and personnel.
In March, according to an account published by the official Xinhua news agency, China’s president, Xi Jinping, declared that “Western countries, led by the United States, have implemented all-around containment, encirclement and suppression against us, bringing unprecedented severe challenges to our development.”
China’s own investment restrictions are broader than the new U.S. rules — they apply to all outbound investments, not just those in the United States. And they reflect a technology policy that in some ways is the opposite of the new U.S. restrictions.
China discouraged or halted most low-tech outbound investments, such as purchases of real estate or even European soccer clubs. But China allowed and even encouraged further acquisitions of businesses with technologies that could offer geopolitical advantages, including investments in overseas businesses involved in aircraft production, robotics, artificial intelligence and heavy manufacturing.

Chip Maker Keeps Roots In Taiwan: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which is manufacturing the world's most advanced microchips, conducts business on the island of Taiwan, dead center in one of the most geopolitically volatile places on the planet.
That makes people in Washington very nervous. TSMC dominates the semiconductor industry; it's a company that the United States can't do without, 80 miles off the coast of China.
The U.S. government has appropriated tens of billions of dollars to strengthen America's own semiconductor sector and help fund TSMC's nascent operations in the United States, far from China, which has never renounced the use of force to absorb Taiwan.
But TSMC has invested billions of its own over nearly four decades growing deep roots in Taiwan. There, it employs a small army of engineers, research and development scientists, technicians and production workers in the exquisitely complex task of producing chips, etching electronic pathways smaller than a cell on plates of silicon.
It would be exceedingly difficult to replicate what TSMC has built in Taiwan, said Mark Liu, chairman of TSMC. Developing and producing the company's most cutting-edge chips at a rapid pace requires a huge effort, he said, as many as 3,000 research scientists for one generation of the technology.
"We cannot put it anyplace else," he said.
TSMC has embarked on a global expansion, with two factories under construction in the United States and one in Japan, as well as a possible facility in Germany. It's part of the company's strategy to address the calls by U.S. officials to reduce America's reliance on chips made in Taiwan.
That makes the 68-year-old Mr. Liu, who holds a doctoral degree in electronic engineering and computer science, as much a diplomat as a scientist and an executive. He joined TSMC 30 years ago after stints at Intel and Bell Labs, rose through the ranks and today runs the $ 500 billion company with its chief executive and vice chairman, C.C. Wei.
In late June, when he spoke to The New York Times at TSMC's offices in the northern Taiwan city of Hsinchu, he had just returned from a trip to the United States, which he said he visits roughly every three months.
"We have a pretty good relationship across Congress, the Commerce Department, the White House. I think they know us," he said.
It's a bit of an understatement. Initial efforts to court TSMC and bring its production facilities to the United States led to the creation of the CHIPS and Science Act, a program to expand the U.S. semiconductor industry. So complete is TSMC's lead in the industry that there is no obvious second option for all it does. Any clash over Taiwan -- where the vast majority of its manufacturing happens -- would stop the flow of the TSMC microchips, putting a deep freeze on the technology industry and, in turn, the global economy.
As befits a company obsessed with protecting its hard-won technological lead, TSMC's offices feel more like a secret government research facility than a Silicon Valley campus.
Next to turnstiles where workers swipe their badges, a sign notes that five people have been fired since 2010 for breaking the company's strict internal security rules. One offense included improperly changing the subject line of an email in a reply. Outside phones are banned. Although policies have recently loosened up, employees tell stories of eating lunch in the parking lot so they can access their personal phones.
Windowless buildings the size of aircraft hangars operate 24 hours a day to produce microchips, the tiny brains inside smartphones, airplanes, supercomputers and just about anything else electronic.
Political leaders in the United States and its allies in trade battles with China have pushed TSMC to build production facilities outside Taiwan. And China has tried hard to compete with TSMC, using everything from hacks and intellectual property theft to hundreds of billions of dollars in investment.
As the United States has sought to hinder China's advances in semiconductor technology, TSMC has been caught in the middle. In 2020, TSMC cut off orders to the Chinese tech powerhouse Huawei, which was TSMC's second-largest customer at the time. Mr. Liu said TSMC, because it is reliant on American technology, had no choice.
"It's understandable, but support or not, we have no say," he said.
Mr. Liu rejected the idea of the "silicon shield": that Taiwan's chip-making prowess deters military action by China and brings support from the United States. Both need Taiwan's chips.
"China will not invade Taiwan because of semiconductors. China will not not invade Taiwan because of semiconductors," he said. "It is really up to the U.S. and China: How do they maintain the status quo, which both sides want?"
TSMC has made a $ 40 billion investment in Arizona to build two factories to produce chips that are one or two generations behind its most advanced ones. The company is expected to submit its application for CHIPS Act subsidies this month, Mr. Liu said.
The Arizona plants have been slow going, and the company has deployed hundreds of Taiwanese technicians to expedite the process. Last month it pushed back the expected start date by a year to 2025, and it has faced high costs and managerial challenges. Internal tensions over cultural differences have surfaced between TSMC and American workers.
And doubts loom over whether American companies will be willing to pay the likely premium required for chips made in Arizona, where TSMC's construction costs alone could be at least four times higher than they are in Taiwan. Mr. Liu said he had told the U.S. government that it needed to offer American companies incentives, beyond the $ 52 billion in subsidies in the CHIPS Act, to buy American-made chips.
"Otherwise, it will be limited," he said. "It will come to limits pretty quickly. So that is on the table. But I don't think we have a solution yet." The Commerce Department, in charge of handling CHIPS Act incentives, declined to comment on specific companies.
In 2018, Mr. Liu said, the Commerce Department under President Donald J. Trump urged the company to invest in the United States. And several TSMC clients privately approached Mr. Liu at an industry conference and expressed the need for it to establish a U.S. manufacturing presence. Mr. Liu sensed the landscape was shifting.
"I thought maybe it's time for TSMC to go a little bit global, because I know our technology is leading today, but what about in the future?" he said.
Before long, the Trump administration's State Department, citing national security grounds, started courting TSMC, emphasizing the role of advanced chips in military gear like F-35 fighter jets. Keith Krach, under secretary of state for economic growth, energy and the environment, arranged a phone call between Mr. Liu, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.
Mr. Liu recalled that Mr. Krach said TSMC was needed to help "catalyze" the American semiconductor industry.
"That for me is also important because the U.S. is where 65 percent of our customers reside," Mr. Liu said. "They have different needs, and we also have opportunities."

U.S. Is Hunting A 'Time Bomb': China Malware: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: American intelligence officials believe the malware could give China the power to disrupt or slow American deployments or resupply operations, including during a Chinese move against Taiwan.
The Biden administration is hunting for malicious computer code it believes China has hidden deep inside the networks controlling power grids, communications systems and water supplies that feed military bases in the United States and around the world, according to American military, intelligence and national security officials.
The discovery of the malware has raised fears that Chinese hackers, probably working for the People's Liberation Army, have inserted code designed to disrupt U.S. military operations in the event of a conflict, including if Beijing moves against Taiwan in coming years.
The malware, one congressional official said, was essentially "a ticking time bomb" that could give China the power to interrupt or slow American military deployments or resupply operations by cutting off power, water and communications to U.S. military bases. But its impact could be far broader, because that same infrastructure often supplies the houses and businesses of ordinary Americans, according to U.S. officials.
The first public hints of the malware campaign began to emerge in late May, when Microsoft said it had detected mysterious computer code in telecommunications systems in Guam, the Pacific island with a vast American air base, and elsewhere in the United States. But that turned out to be only the narrow slice of the problem that Microsoft could see through its networks.
More than a dozen U.S. officials and industry experts said in interviews over the past two months that the Chinese effort goes far beyond telecommunications systems and predated the May report by at least a year. They said the U.S. government's effort to hunt down the code, and eradicate it, has been underway for some time. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential and in some cases classified assessments.
They say the investigations so far show the Chinese effort appears more widespread -- in the United States and at American facilities abroad -- than they had initially realized. But officials acknowledge that they do not know the full extent of the code's presence in networks around the world, partly because it is so well hidden.
The discovery of the malware has touched off a series of Situation Room meetings in the White House in recent months, as senior officials from the National Security Council, the Pentagon, the Homeland Security Department and the nation's spy agencies attempt to understand the scope of the problem and plot a response.
Biden administration officials have begun to brief members of Congress, some state governors and utility companies about the findings, and confirmed some conclusions about the operation in interviews with The New York Times.
There is a debate inside the administration over whether the goal of the operation is primarily aimed at disrupting the military, or at civilian life more broadly in the event of a conflict. But officials say that the initial searches for the code have focused first on areas with a high concentration of American military bases.
In response to questions from The Times, the White House issued a statement Friday night that made no reference to China or the military bases.
"The Biden administration is working relentlessly to defend the United States from any disruptions to our critical infrastructure, including by coordinating interagency efforts to protect water systems, pipelines, rail and aviation systems, among others," said Adam R. Hodge, the acting spokesman for the National Security Council.
He added: "The president has also mandated rigorous cybersecurity practices for the first time." Mr. Hodge was referring to a series of executive orders, some motivated by concerns over SolarWinds, commercial software used widely by the U.S. government that was breached by a Russian surveillance operation, and the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack by a Russian criminal group. That attack resulted in the temporary cutoff of half the gasoline, jet fuel and diesel supplies that run up the East Coast.
The U.S. government and Microsoft have attributed the recent malware attack to Chinese state-sponsored actors, but the government has not disclosed why it reached that conclusion. There is debate among different arms of the U.S. government about the intent of the intrusions, but not about their source.
The public revelation of the malware operation comes at an especially fraught moment in relations between Washington and Beijing, with clashes that include Chinese threats against Taiwan and American efforts to ban the sale of highly sophisticated semiconductors to the Chinese government. Many of the tensions in the relationship have been driven not only by technological competition but by mutual accusations of malicious activity in cyberspace.
The United States has blamed China for a variety of major hacks against U.S. agencies and infrastructure, and accused the foreign power of spying from a bus-size balloon that traversed the United States in February, until it was shot down off South Carolina. For its part, China has accused the United States of hacking into Huawei, its telecommunications giant. Secret documents released a decade ago by Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor now in exile in Russia, confirmed that American intelligence agencies did just that.
But almost all of those cases involved intelligence gathering. The discovery of the malicious code in American infrastructure, one of Mr. Biden's most senior advisers said, "raises the question of what, exactly, they are preparing for."
If gaining advantage in a Taiwan confrontation is at the heart of China's intent, slowing down American military deployments by a few days or weeks might give China a window in which it would have an easier time taking control of the island by force.
Chinese concern about American intervention was most likely fueled by President Biden's several statements over the past 18 months that he would defend Taiwan with American troops if necessary.
Another theory is that the code is intended to distract. Chinese officials, U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed, may believe that during an attack on Taiwan or other Chinese action, any interruptions in U.S. infrastructure could so fixate the attention of American citizens that they would think little about an overseas conflict.
The Chinese embassy in Washington issued a statement on Saturday after publication of this article, denying that it engages in hacking and accusing the United States of being a far larger offender. "We have always firmly opposed and cracked down on all forms of cyberattacking in accordance with the law," said Haoming Ouyang, an embassy spokesman.
"The Chinese government agencies face numerous cyberattacks every day, most of which come from sources in the U.S.," he wrote, adding: "We hope relevant parties will stop smearing China with groundless accusations."
Chinese officials have never conceded that China was behind the theft of security clearance files of roughly 22 million Americans -- including six million sets of fingerprints -- from the Office of Personnel Management during the Obama administration. That exfiltration resulted in an agreement between President Obama and President Xi Jinping that resulted in a brief decline in malicious Chinese cyberactivity. The agreement has since collapsed.
Now, Chinese cyberoperations seem to have taken a turn. The latest intrusions are different from those in the past because disruption, not surveillance, appears to be the objective, U.S. officials say.
At the Aspen Security Forum earlier this month, Rob Joyce, the director of cybersecurity at the National Security Agency, said China's recent hack targeting the American ambassador to Beijing, Nicholas Burns, and the commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, was traditional espionage. The spy balloon shot down earlier this year also captured public attention, but generated less concern inside the intelligence community. Intelligence officials and others in the Biden administration viewed those operations as the kind of spy-versus-spy games that Washington and Beijing have run against each other for decades.
In contrast, Mr. Joyce said the intrusions in Guam were "really disturbing" because of their disruptive potential.
The Chinese code, the officials say, appears directed at ordinary utilities that serve both civilian populations and nearby military bases. Only America's nuclear sites have self-contained communication systems, electricity and water pipelines. (The code has not been found in classified systems. Officials declined to describe the unclassified military networks in which the code has been found.)
While the most sensitive planning is carried out on classified networks, the military routinely uses unclassified, but secure, networks for basic communications, personnel matters, logistics and supply issues.
Officials say that if the malware is activated, it is not clear how effective it would be at slowing an American response -- and that the Chinese government may not know, either. In interviews, officials said they believe that in many cases the communications, computer networks and power grids could be quickly restored in a matter of days.
But intelligence analysts have concluded that China may believe there is utility in any disruptive attack that could slow down the U.S. response.
The initial Microsoft discovery in Guam -- home to major U.S. Air Force and Marine bases -- was attributed by the company to a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group that the company named Volt Typhoon.
A warning from the Homeland Security Department's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the National Security Agency and others issued the same day also said the malware was from the state-sponsored Chinese hacking group and was "living off the land." The phrase means that it was avoiding detection by blending in with normal computer activity, conducted by authorized users. But the warning did not outline other details of the threat.
Some officials briefly considered whether to leave the malware in place, quietly monitor the code they had found and prepare plans to try to neutralize it if it was even activated. Monitoring the intrusions would allow them to learn more about it, and possibly lull the Chinese hackers into a false sense that their penetration had not been exposed.
But senior White House officials quickly rejected that option and said that given the potential threat, the prudent path was to excise the offending malware as quickly as it could be found.
Still, there are risks.
American cybersecurity experts are able to remove some of the malware, but some officials said there are concerns that the Chinese could use similar techniques to quickly regain access.
Removing the Volt Typhoon malware also runs the risk of tipping off China's increasingly talented hacking forces about what intrusions the United States is able to find, and what it is missing. If that happens, China could improve its techniques and be able to reinfect military systems with even harder-to-find software.
The recent Chinese penetrations have been enormously difficult to detect. The sophistication of the attacks limits how much the implanted software is communicating with Beijing, making it difficult to discover. Many hacks are discovered when experts track information being extracted out of a network, or unauthorized accesses are made. But this malware can lay dormant for long periods of time.
Speaking earlier this month at an intelligence summit, George Barnes, the deputy director of the National Security Agency, said the Volt Typhoon attacks demonstrated how much more sophisticated China had become at penetrating government and private sector networks.
Mr. Barnes said that rather than exploit flaws in software to gain access, China had found ways to steal or mimic the credentials of system administrators, the people who run computer networks. Once those are in hand, the Chinese hackers essentially have the freedom to go anywhere in a network and implant their own code.
"China is steadfast and determined to penetrate our governments, our companies, our critical infrastructure," Mr. Barnes said.
"In the earlier days, China's cyberoperations activities were very noisy and very rudimentary," he continued. "They have continued to bring resources, sophistication and mass to their game. So the sophistication continues to increase."

WASHINGTON — The Biden administration is hunting for malicious computer code it believes China has hidden deep inside the networks controlling power grids, communications systems and water supplies that feed military bases in the United States and around the world, according to U.S. military, intelligence and national security officials.
The discovery of the malware has raised fears that Chinese hackers, probably working for the People’s Liberation Army, have inserted code designed to disrupt U.S. military operations in the event of a conflict, including if Beijing moves against Taiwan in coming years.
The malware, one congressional official said, was essentially “a ticking time bomb” that could give China the power to interrupt or slow U.S. military deployments or resupply operations by cutting off power, water and communications to military bases. But its impact could be far broader, because that same infrastructure often supplies the houses and businesses of ordinary Americans, according to U.S. officials.
The first public hints of the malware campaign began to emerge in late May, when Microsoft said it had detected mysterious computer code in telecommunications systems in Guam, the Pacific island with a vast American air base, and elsewhere in the United States. But that turned out to be only the narrow slice of the problem that Microsoft could see through its networks.
More than a dozen U.S. officials and industry experts said in interviews over the past two months that the Chinese effort goes far beyond telecommunications systems and predated the May report by at least a year. They said the U.S. government’s effort to hunt down the code, and eradicate it, has been underway for some time. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential and in some cases classified assessments.
They say the investigations so far show the Chinese effort appears more widespread — in the United States and at American facilities abroad — than they had initially realized. But officials acknowledge that they do not know the full extent of the code’s presence in networks around the world, partly because it is so well hidden.
The discovery of the malware has touched off a series of Situation Room meetings in the White House in recent months, as senior officials from the National Security Council, the Pentagon, the Homeland Security Department and the nation’s spy agencies attempt to understand the scope of the problem and plot a response.
Biden administration officials have begun to brief members of Congress, some state governors and utility companies about the findings, and confirmed some conclusions about the operation in interviews with The New York Times.
There is a debate inside the administration over whether the goal of the operation is primarily aimed at disrupting the military, or at civilian life more broadly in the event of a conflict. But officials say that the initial searches for the code have focused first on areas with a high concentration of U.S. military bases.
In response to questions from the Times, the White House issued a statement Friday night that made no reference to China or the military bases.
“The Biden administration is working relentlessly to defend the United States from any disruptions to our critical infrastructure, including by coordinating interagency efforts to protect water systems, pipelines, rail and aviation systems, among others,” said Adam Hodge, acting spokesperson for the National Security Council.
He added: “The president has also mandated rigorous cybersecurity practices for the first time.” Hodge was referring to a series of executive orders, some motivated by concerns over SolarWinds, commercial software used widely by the U.S. government that was breached by a Russian surveillance operation, and the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack by a Russian criminal group. That attack resulted in the temporary cutoff of half the gasoline, jet fuel and diesel supplies that run up the East Coast.
The U.S. government and Microsoft have attributed the recent malware attack to Chinese state-sponsored actors, but the government has not disclosed why it reached that conclusion. There is debate among different arms of the U.S. government about the intent of the intrusions, but not about their source.
The public revelation of the malware operation comes at an especially fraught moment in relations between Washington and Beijing, with clashes that include Chinese threats against Taiwan as well as U.S. efforts to ban the sale of highly sophisticated semiconductors to the Chinese government. Many of the tensions in the relationship have been driven not only by technological competition but by mutual accusations of malicious activity in cyberspace.
The United States has blamed China for a variety of major hacks against U.S. agencies and infrastructure, and accused the foreign power of spying from a bus-size balloon that traversed the United States in February, until it was shot down off South Carolina. For its part, China has accused the United States of hacking into Huawei, its telecommunications giant. Secret documents released a decade ago by Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor now in exile in Russia, confirmed that U.S. intelligence agencies did just that.
But almost all of those cases involved intelligence gathering. The discovery of the malicious code in American infrastructure, one of President Joe Biden’s most senior advisers said, “raises the question of what, exactly, they are preparing for.”
If gaining advantage in a Taiwan confrontation is at the heart of China’s intent, slowing down U.S. military deployments by a few days or weeks might give China a window in which it would have an easier time taking control of the island by force.
Chinese concern about U.S. intervention was most likely fueled by Biden’s several statements over the past 18 months that he would defend Taiwan with U.S. troops if necessary.
Another theory is that the code is intended to distract. Chinese officials, U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed, may believe that during an attack on Taiwan or other Chinese action, any interruptions in U.S. infrastructure could so fixate the attention of American citizens that they would think little about an overseas conflict.
The Chinese Embassy in Washington issued a statement Saturday after publication of this article, denying that it engages in hacking and accusing the United States of being a far larger offender.
“We have always firmly opposed and cracked down on all forms of cyberattacking in accordance with the law,” said Haoming Ouyang, an embassy spokesperson.
“The Chinese government agencies face numerous cyberattacks every day, most of which come from sources in the U.S.,” he wrote, adding: “We hope relevant parties will stop smearing China with groundless accusations.”
Chinese officials have never conceded that China was behind the theft of security clearance files of roughly 22 million Americans — including 6 million sets of fingerprints — from the Office of Personnel Management during the Obama administration. That exfiltration resulted in an agreement between President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping that resulted in a brief decline in malicious Chinese cyberactivity. The agreement has since collapsed.
Now, Chinese cyberoperations seem to have taken a turn. The latest intrusions are different from those in the past because disruption, not surveillance, appears to be the objective, U.S. officials say.
At the Aspen Security Forum last week, Rob Joyce, director of cybersecurity at the National Security Agency, said China’s recent hack targeting the U.S. ambassador to Beijing, Nicholas Burns, and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo was traditional espionage. The spy balloon shot down earlier this year also captured public attention, but generated less concern inside the intelligence community. Intelligence officials and others in the Biden administration viewed those operations as the kind of spy-versus-spy games that Washington and Beijing have run against each other for decades.
In contrast, Joyce said the intrusions in Guam were “really disturbing” because of their disruptive potential.
The Chinese code, the officials say, appears directed at ordinary utilities that serve both civilian populations and nearby military bases. Only U.S. nuclear sites have self-contained communication systems, electricity and water pipelines. (The code has not been found in classified systems. Officials declined to describe the unclassified military networks in which the code has been found.)
While the most sensitive planning is carried out on classified networks, the military routinely uses unclassified, but secure, networks for basic communications, personnel matters, logistics and supply issues.
Officials say that if the malware is activated, it is not clear how effective it would be at slowing an American response — and that the Chinese government may not know, either. In interviews, officials said they believe that in many cases the communications, computer networks and power grids could be quickly restored in a matter of days.
But intelligence analysts have concluded that China may believe there is utility in any disruptive attack that could slow down the U.S. response.
The initial Microsoft discovery in Guam — home to major U.S. Air Force and Marine bases — was attributed by the company to a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group that the company named Volt Typhoon.
A warning from the Homeland Security Department’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the NSA and others issued the same day also said the malware was from the state-sponsored Chinese hacking group and was “living off the land.” The phrase means that it was avoiding detection by blending in with normal computer activity, conducted by authorized users. But the warning did not outline other details of the threat.
Some officials briefly considered whether to leave the malware in place, quietly monitor the code they had found and prepare plans to try to neutralize it if it was even activated. Monitoring the intrusions would allow them to learn more about it, and possibly lull the Chinese hackers into a false sense that their penetration had not been exposed.
But senior White House officials quickly rejected that option and said that given the potential threat, the prudent path was to excise the offending malware as quickly as it could be found.
Still, there are risks. U.S. cybersecurity experts are able to remove some of the malware, but some officials said there are concerns that the Chinese could use similar techniques to quickly regain access.
Removing the Volt Typhoon malware also runs the risk of tipping off China’s increasingly talented hacking forces about what intrusions the United States is able to find, and what it is missing. If that happens, China could improve its techniques and be able to reinfect military systems with even harder-to-find software.

Biden Is Weighing a Big Middle East Deal: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For the hundreds of thousands of Israeli democracy defenders who tried to block Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's judicial coup on Monday, the stripping of the Israeli Supreme Court's key powers to curb the executive branch surely feels like a stinging defeat. I get it, but don't totally despair. Help may be on the way from talks between the United States and Saudi Arabia.
Yes, you read that right.
When I interviewed President Biden in the Oval Office last week, my column focused on his urging Netanyahu not to ram through the judicial overhaul without even a semblance of national consensus. But that's not all we talked about. The president is wrestling with whether to pursue the possibility of a U.S.-Saudi mutual security pact that would involve Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel, provided that Israel make concessions to the Palestinians that would preserve the possibility of a two-state solution.
After discussions in the past few days among Biden; his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan; Secretary of State Antony Blinken; and Brett McGurk, the top White House official handling Middle East policy, Biden has dispatched Sullivan and McGurk to Saudi Arabia, where they arrived Thursday morning, to explore the possibility of some kind of U.S.-Saudi-Israeli-Palestinian understanding.
The president still has not made up his mind whether to proceed, but he gave a green light for his team to probe with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia to see if some kind of deal is possible and at what price. Closing such a multinational deal would be time-consuming, difficult and complex, even if Biden decides to take it to the next level right away. But the exploratory talks are moving ahead now -- faster than I thought -- and they're important for two reasons.
First, a U.S.-Saudi security pact that produces normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and the Jewish state -- while curtailing Saudi-China relations -- would be a game changer for the Middle East, bigger than the Camp David peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. Because peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia, the custodian of Islam's two holiest cities, Mecca and Medina, would open the way for peace between Israel and the whole Muslim world, including giant countries like Indonesia and maybe even Pakistan. It would be a significant Biden foreign policy legacy.
Second, if the United States forges a security alliance with Saudi Arabia -- on the conditions that it normalize relations with Israel and that Israel make meaningful concessions to the Palestinians -- Netanyahu's ruling coalition of Jewish supremacists and religious extremists would have to answer this question: You can annex the West Bank, or you can have peace with Saudi Arabia and the whole Muslim world, but you can't have both, so which will it be?
Now wouldn't that make an interesting discussion around Netanyahu's cabinet table?
I'd love to see Israel's far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, go on Israeli television and explain to the Israeli people why it is in Israel's interest to annex the West Bank and its 2.9 million Palestinian inhabitants -- forever -- rather than normalize ties with Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Muslim world. A Saudi-Israeli peace could dramatically reduce the Muslim-Jewish antipathy born over a century ago with the start of the Jewish-Palestinian conflict.
But before such a choice -- annexation or normalization -- can be brought before this extremist Israeli government, a lot of things have to be agreed to by a lot of people.
That said, Jake Sullivan is not in Riyadh today for tourism.
The Saudis are seeking three main things from Washington: a NATO-level mutual security treaty that would enjoin the United States to come to Saudi Arabia's defense if it is attacked (most likely by Iran); a civilian nuclear program, monitored by the United States; and the ability to purchase more advanced U.S. weapons, like the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense antiballistic missile defense system, which are particularly helpful to the Saudis against Iran's growing mid- and long-range missile arsenal.
Among the things the U.S. wants from the Saudis are an end to the fighting in Yemen, where the conflict has blessedly been diminishing over the past year, an unprecedentedly large Saudi aid package to Palestinian institutions in the West Bank and significant limits on the growing relationship between Saudi Arabia and China.
For instance, the U.S. was not amused by reports last year that Saudi Arabia was considering accepting Chinese renminbi to price some oil sales to China instead of the U.S. dollar. Over time, given the economic clout of China and Saudi Arabia, that could have a very negative impact on the U.S. dollar as the world's most important currency. That would have to be canceled. The U.S. also wants the Saudis to curtail their dealings with Chinese tech giants like Huawei, whose latest telecommunications equipment is banned in the U.S.
This would be the first time the U.S. signed a mutual security pact with a nondemocratic government since President Dwight Eisenhower did so with predemocratic South Korea in 1953, and it would require Senate approval.
Just as important, though, is what the Saudis would demand of Israel to preserve the prospect of a two-state solution -- the way the United Arab Emirates demanded that Netanyahu forgo any annexation of the West Bank as a price for their Abraham Accords.
The Saudi leadership is not particularly interested in the Palestinians or knowledgeable about the intricacies of the peace process.
But if the Biden team made a deal without a significant Palestinian component, it would simultaneously strike a death blow to the Israeli democracy movement -- by giving Netanyahu a huge geopolitical prize for free after he just did something so antidemocratic -- and to the two-state solution, the cornerstone of U.S. Middle East diplomacy.
I don't believe Biden will do that. It would spark a rebellion in the progressive base of his party and make ratification of the deal well nigh impossible.
"It will be hard enough for President Biden to sell any deal like this to the U.S. Congress," Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, which funds the State Department, said to me. "But I can assure you that there will be a strong core of Democratic opposition to any proposal that does not include meaningful, clearly defined and enforceable provisions to preserve the option of a two-state solution and to meet President Biden's own demand that Palestinians and Israelis enjoy equal measures of freedom and dignity. These elements are essential to any sustainable peace in the Middle East."
I believe that, at a minimum, the Saudis and Americans could (and should) demand four things from Netanyahu for such a huge prize as normalization and trade with the most important Arab Muslim state:
An official promise not to annex the West Bank -- ever.
No new West Bank settlements or expansion outward of existing settlements.
No legalization of wildcat Jewish settlement outposts.
And transferring some Palestinian populated territory from Area C in the West Bank (now under full Israeli control) to Areas A and B (under Palestinian Authority control) -- as provided for in the Oslo accords. In return, the Palestinian Authority would have to endorse Saudi Arabia's peace deal with Israel.
Truth be told, the Palestinian Authority is in no position to engage in peace talks with Israel today. It's a mess. The Palestinians need to remake their government, but in the meantime, the far-right ministers in Israel's cabinet are trying to absorb as much of the West Bank as fast as they can. The urgent need is to stop that immediately -- but not with another dose of finger wagging from the State Department about how "deeply troubled" the U.S. is about Israeli settlements. Rather, the best move is a big strategic initiative that has something significant for everyone, except the zealots on all sides.
I repeat: Any deal will take months of difficult negotiations among the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Israel and the Palestinian Authority -- and success would be a long shot, at best.
But if Biden decides to try for it and the U.S. could put on the table a deal that is hugely in America's strategic interest, hugely in Israel's strategic interest, hugely in Saudi Arabia's strategic interest (admitting it into a very exclusive club of countries with a U.S. security umbrella) and revive Palestinian hopes for a two-state solution, that would be a very, very big deal.
And if it also forced Netanyahu to abandon the extremists in his cabinet and make common cause with the Israeli center left and center right, well, wouldn't that just be the cherry on top?

House Committee Targets U.C. Berkeley Program for Ties to China: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A House select committee is requesting more information about a university collaboration that it said could help China gain access to cutting-edge research.
A congressional committee focused on national security threats from China said it had "grave concerns" about a research partnership between the University of California, Berkeley, and several Chinese entities, claiming that the collaboration's advanced research could help the Chinese government gain an economic, technological or military advantage.
In a letter sent last week to officials at Berkeley and the University of California system, the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party requested extensive information about the Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute, a collaboration set up in 2014 with China's prestigious Tsinghua University and the Chinese city of Shenzhen.
The letter pointed to the institute's research into certain "dual-use technologies" that both civilian and military institutions employ, like advanced semiconductors and imaging technology used for mapping terrain or driving autonomous cars.
The committee also questioned whether Berkeley had properly disclosed Chinese funding for the institute, and cited its collaborations with Chinese universities and companies that have been the subjects of sanctions by the United States in recent years, like the National University of Defense Technology, the telecom firm Huawei and the Chinese drone maker DJI.
It also said Berkeley faculty serving at the institute had received funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and other U.S. funding for the development of military applications, raising concerns about Chinese access to those experts.
In April, for example, a team from a Shenzhen-based lab that describes itself as being supported by the Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute said it had won a contest in China to optimize a type of advanced chip technology that the U.S. government is now trying to prevent Chinese companies from acquiring, the letter said.
It is not clear what role the university had in that project, or if the partnership, or the institute's other activities, would violate U.S. restrictions on China's access to technology. In October, the United States set significant limits on the type of advanced semiconductor technology that could be shared with Chinese entities, saying the activity posed a national security threat.
"Berkeley's P.R.C.-backed collaboration with Tsinghua University raises many red flags," the letter said, referring to the People's Republic of China. It was signed by Representatives Mike Gallagher, a Wisconsin Republican and the committee's chair, and Virginia Foxx, a Republican from North Carolina who is the committee chair on education and the work force.
In a statement to The New York Times, U.C. Berkeley said it took concerns about national security "very seriously" and was committed to comprehensive compliance with laws governing international academic engagement.
"The campus is reviewing past agreements and actions involving or connected to Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute" and will "fully and transparently cooperate with any federal inquiries," it said.
The university also said it had responded to inquiries from the Department of Education with detailed information about gifts and contracts related to the institute, that it was committed to full compliance with laws governing such arrangements and that it "follows the lead of Congress and federal regulators when evaluating proposed research relationships with foreign entities."
Universities have also emphasized that foreign governments might have little to gain from infiltrating such partnerships, since academic researchers are focused on fundamental research that, while potentially valuable, is promptly published in academic journals for all to see.
"As a matter of principle, Berkeley conducts research that is openly published for the entire global scientific community," the university said in its statement.
The letter, and other accusations from members of Congress about U.S. universities with partners in China, underscore how a rapid evolution in U.S.-China relations is putting new pressure on academic partnerships that were set up to share information and break down barriers between the countries.
The Chinese government has sought to improve the country's technological capacity through legitimate commercial partnerships, but also espionage, cybertheft and coercion. Those efforts -- along with a program to meld military and civilian innovation -- has led to a backlash in the United States against ties with Chinese academic institutions and private companies that might have seemed relatively innocuous a decade ago.
The select committee, which was set up this year, describes its mission as building consensus on the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party and developing a plan to defend the United States. The bipartisan committee, which is led by Republicans, can provide legislative recommendations but cannot legislate on its own. It has been busily naming and shaming major companies and others over ties to China in congressional hearings, investigations and letters.
Tensions between the United States and China are high, and some lawmakers have called for decoupling the two economies. But severing academic ties is a tricky prospect. American universities are geared toward open and collaborative research and count many Chinese scholars among their work forces. China's significant technology industry and huge population of science and technology doctorates make it a natural magnet for many research collaborations.
Still, the rapid expansion of export controls in the United States is putting more restrictions on the type of information and data related to advanced technologies that can be legally shared with individuals and organizations in China. Under the new rules, even carrying a laptop to China with certain chip designs on it, or giving a Chinese national a tour of an advanced U.S. chip lab, can violate the law.
The House committee asked the university to provide extensive documents and information by July 27 about the partnership, including its funding, structure and technological work; its alumni's current and past affiliations; and its compliance with U.S. export controls.

Geopolitics Challenges Chipmakers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Chipmakers are finding it increasingly hard to operate in China but say doing business in the country is still key to their survival.
In May, Micron Technologies, the Idaho chipmaker, suffered a serious blow as part of the U.S.-China technology war. The Chinese government barred companies that handle crucial information from buying Micron's chips, saying the company had failed a cybersecurity review.
Micron said the change could destroy roughly an eighth of its global revenue. Yet in June, the chipmaker announced that it would increase its investments in China -- adding $ 600 million to expand a chip packaging facility in the Chinese city of Xian.
"This investment project demonstrates Micron's unwavering commitment to its China business and team," an announcement posted on the company's Chinese social media account said.
Global semiconductor companies are finding themselves in an extremely tricky position as they try to straddle a growing rift between the United States and China. The semiconductor industry has become ground zero for the technology rivalry between Washington and Beijing, with new restrictions and punitive measures imposed by both sides.
U.S. officials say American products have fed into Chinese military and surveillance programs that run counter to the national security interest of the United States. They have imposed increasingly tough restrictions on the kind of chips and chip-making equipment that can be sent to China, and are offering new incentives, including grants and tax credits, for chipmakers who choose to build new operations in the United States.
But factories can take years to construct, and corporate ties between the countries remain strong. China is a major market for chips, since it is home to many factories that make chip-rich products, including smartphones, dishwashers, cars and computers, that are both exported around the world and purchased by consumers in China.
Overall, China accounts for roughly a third of global semiconductor sales. But for some chipmakers, the country accounts for 60 percent or 70 percent of their revenue. Even when chips are manufactured in the United States, they are often sent to China for assembly and testing.
"We can't just flip a switch and say all of sudden you have to take everything out of China," said Emily S. Weinstein, a research fellow at Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology.
The industry's reliance on China highlights how a close -- but extremely contentious -- economic relationship between Washington and Beijing is posing challenges for both sides.
Those tensions were reflected during Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen's visit to Beijing this week, where she tried to walk a fine line by faulting some of China's practices while insisting the United States was not looking to sever ties with the country.
Ms. Yellen criticized punitive measures China has recently taken against foreign firms, including limiting the export of some minerals used in chip making, and suggested that such actions were why the Biden administration was trying to make U.S. manufacturers less reliant on China. But she also affirmed the U.S.-China relationship as strategic and important.
"I have made clear that the United States does not seek a wholesale separation of our economies," Ms. Yellen said during a roundtable with U.S. companies operating in China. "We seek to diversify, not to decouple. A decoupling of the world's two largest economies would be destabilizing for the global economy, and it would be virtually impossible to undertake."
The Biden administration is poised to begin investing heavily in American semiconductor manufacturing to lure factories out of China. Later this year, the Commerce Department is expected to begin handing out funds to help companies build U.S. chip facilities. That money will come with strings: Firms that take funding must refrain from expanding high-tech manufacturing facilities in China.
The administration is also weighing further curbs on the chips that can be sent to China, as part of a push to expand and finalize sweeping restrictions it issued last October.
These measures could include potential limits on sales to China of advanced chips used for artificial intelligence, new restrictions for Chinese companies' access to U.S. cloud computing services, and restrictions on U.S. venture capital investments in the Chinese chip sector, according to people familiar with the plans.
The administration has also been considering halting the licenses it has extended to some U.S. chipmakers that have allowed them to continue selling products to Huawei, the Chinese telecom firm.
Japan and the Netherlands, which are home to companies that make advanced chip manufacturing equipment, have also put new restrictions on their sales to China, in part because of urging from the United States.
China has issued restrictions of its own, including new export controls on minerals used in chip manufacturing.
Amid tighter regulations and new incentive programs from the United States and Europe, global chip companies are increasingly looking outside China as they choose the locations for their next major investments. But these facilities will likely take years to construct, meaning any changes to the global semiconductor market will unfold gradually.
John Neuffer, the president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, which represents the chip industry, said in a statement that the ongoing escalation of controls posed a significant risk to the global competitiveness of the U.S. industry.
"China is the world's largest market for semiconductors, and our companies simply need to do business there to continue to grow, innovate and stay ahead of global competitors," he said. "We urge solutions that protect national security, avoid inadvertent and lasting damage to the chip industry, and avert future escalations."

Yellen's Task? Bolster Links With Beijing.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Treasury secretary will need to defend export controls and tariffs while explaining that the United States does not aim to harm China's economy.
At her confirmation hearing in early 2021, Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen struck a tough tone on China, describing it as America's most important strategic competitor and pledging to confront its "abusive, unfair and illegal practices" that she said were harming businesses and workers in the United States.
Since then, Ms. Yellen has emerged as a voice of moderation in the Biden administration, embracing the mantle of economic pragmatism as the world economy copes with inflation and sluggish growth. The Treasury secretary has expressed objections to China's record on human rights, called for diversifying American supply chains and acknowledged that protecting national security is paramount.
But she has also been the administration's most prominent proponent of maintaining economic ties with China, arguing against tariffs, urging caution on new restrictions on investment in China and, most recently, warning that decoupling the two economies would be "disastrous."
Ms. Yellen will be navigating those conflicting interests in real time during a four-day visit to China. The trip, her first to the country as Treasury secretary, represents Ms. Yellen's most challenging test of economic diplomacy to date as she attempts to ease years of festering distrust between the United States and China.
The Treasury secretary arrived on Thursday afternoon and was greeted on the tarmac at Beijing's airport by Yang Yingming, director general of China's finance ministry, and R. Nicholas Burns, the U.S. ambassador to China.
During her first full day of meetings on Friday, Ms. Yellen will meet with Liu He, China's former vice premier, and Zhou Xiaochuan, the former governor of the People's Bank of China. Later Friday, Ms. Yellen will meet with Premier Li Qiang at the Great Hall of the People. The Treasury secretary will also participate in a round-table discussion with officials from the American Chamber of Commerce in China to hear about the challenges that U.S. companies are facing in China.
For Ms. Yellen, the challenge will be to convince her Chinese counterparts that the bevy of U.S. measures blocking access to sensitive technology such as semiconductors in the name of national security are not intended to inflict harm on the Chinese economy. That will not be easy, as both countries continue to erect new barriers to trade and investment.
The Biden administration is preparing several new restrictions on U.S. technology trade with China, including potential limits on advanced chips and U.S. investment in the country. Forthcoming rules also appear likely to clamp down on Chinese companies' access to U.S. cloud computing services, according to people familiar with the matter, in an effort to close a loophole in earlier restrictions on China's access to advanced chips used for artificial intelligence.
This week Beijing retaliated against the Biden administration's limits on semiconductors, announcing it would restrict the export of certain critical minerals used in the production of some chips. A senior Treasury official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said on Thursday that the restrictions were likely to be discussed during Ms. Yellen's meetings this week. The official added that the move is an example of why it is important to have diversified supply chains.
On Monday, ahead of her trip, Ms. Yellen met in Washington with Xie Feng, China's ambassador to the United States, and laid out "issues of concern" in what the Treasury Department described as a frank conversation. According to a summary of the conversation released by the Chinese Embassy, Mr. Xie explained China's objections to America's trade practices and urged the United States to take steps to resolve them.
In her meetings in Beijing, Ms. Yellen is expected to make the case that the Biden administration's actions to make the U.S. economy less reliant on China and to entice more production of critical materials inside the United States are narrowly focused measures that are not meant to instigate a broader economic war. China continues to hold nearly $ 1 trillion of U.S. debt and is America's third-largest trading partner, making an abrupt severing of ties potentially calamitous for both countries and the global economy.
"I think she is going to go as the sober voice of reason to say this is not about containment," said Tim Adams, the president and chief executive of the Institute of International Finance and a former Treasury under secretary for international affairs. "It's really about setting the tone of cooperation and showing that the U.S. remains interested in being engaged with China on trade and investment."
Through the past several decades, the Treasury has consistently been the American government agency that has tried hardest to maintain friendly relations with China. Wall Street firms, a key constituency for the department, tried through the 1990s to win access to the Chinese market through China's negotiations to join the World Trade Organization. After China joined the W.T.O. in 2002, Wall Street firms and the Treasury Department pushed for China to move faster in actually opening its markets.
Beijing finally agreed in November 2017 to allow foreign investors to hold much larger stakes in insurance, banking and securities businesses, as part of a series of concessions made in an unsuccessful attempt to head off a trade war with the Trump administration.
While it is her first trip to Beijing as Treasury secretary, Ms. Yellen is no stranger to China. In her role as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, she had regular contact with Chinese officials, and as chair of the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018 she would meet with officials from China's central bank at international gatherings.
Ms. Yellen's credentials as an academic economist have made her a welcome emissary in Beijing.
"They like her very much because she looks at the world in economic terms, and they're extremely comfortable with that," said Craig Allen, the president of the U.S.-China Business Council.
Michael Pillsbury, a senior fellow for China strategy at the Heritage Foundation, said that Chinese officials viewed Ms. Yellen as a voice of reason and that they hoped she would be able to make the case to others in the Biden administration that the United States should back away from new investment restrictions and roll back tariffs.
"They want Janet to help," said Mr. Pillsbury, who was a top adviser on China in the Trump administration. "They see her as a friend of China."
Ms. Yellen does not direct trade policy, but she has been critical of the tariffs that President Donald J. Trump imposed on more than $ 300 billion of Chinese imports.
"Tariffs are taxes on consumers," Ms. Yellen told The New York Times in 2021. "In some cases it seems to me what we did hurt American consumers, and the type of deal that the prior administration negotiated really didn't address in many ways the fundamental problems we have with China."
Those tariffs remain under review by the Office of the United States Trade Representative, and Ms. Yellen has acknowledged that they are unlikely to be rolled back anytime soon.
Ms. Yellen's ability to forge deeper ties with Beijing could be complicated by the current political moment.
Concerns about China have grown after a spy balloon traversed the United States before being shot down over the Atlantic Ocean. The upcoming presidential election is also likely to escalate anti-China rhetoric as candidates look to paint themselves as tough on China, often a winning campaign message. And Republicans have been expressing criticism of greater U.S. outreach to China.
Ms. Yellen's visit follows a trip last month by Antony J. Blinken, the secretary of state. John F. Kerry, the special climate envoy, is expected to make a trip to Beijing soon.
Representative Mike Gallagher, a Wisconsin Republican who leads the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, accused the Biden administration of slow-walking export restrictions targeting Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, and sanctions against Chinese officials responsible for human rights violations against Uyghurs in Xinjiang. He argued that China's behavior had gotten worse while the Biden administration pursued "zombie engagement" with the Chinese Communist Party.
"After Secretary Blinken left Beijing with little to show for his trip, doubling down by sending additional cabinet-level officials like Secretary Yellen would only perpetuate this vicious cycle," Mr. Gallagher said.
With Republican presidential candidates like Nikki Haley warning that China is "preparing for war" with the United States, there is additional urgency for Ms. Yellen to find ways to keep the lines of communication with her Chinese counterparts open even if her trip does not yield any major breakthroughs.
"The Chinese are very aware of the U.S. election cycle, and in my mind this is partly why they have been willing to be a little more open," said Eswar Prasad, a former head of the International Monetary Fund's China division. "Both Secretary Yellen and the Chinese would like to get back to a place where they see at least parts of the economic relationship as a positive-sum game, rather than a zero-sum game."

Google's New Pixel Phone Makes the Case for Foldables: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Google's new $ 1,800 gadget proves that phones with bendable screens are something people might want. Now they just need to get cheaper.
When I recently turned on Google's new Pixel Fold smartphone and unfolded it as if it were a book, it transformed into a miniature tablet, similar to an iPad Mini or an Amazon Fire. Then something unexpected happened.
For the next few hours, I found it difficult to put the device down, as if I were sucked into a great novel. The phone's performance was smooth and fast, and the bigger screen made reading emails, watching videos and reading comic books more delightful than on a normal phone screen.
I was surprised because I have been wary of foldable phones. The earliest models released by Samsung, Motorola and Huawei about four years ago had glaring flaws. They were thick and heavy, had durability issues and lacked software to take advantage of their novel hardware. But I immediately knew the Pixel Fold -- Google's first foldable phone -- was different.
When I folded the device back up, a second 5.8-inch outer screen illuminated, converting it into a regular smartphone that could be used with one hand. Importantly, it was not too chunky -- it's about half an inch thick folded up, which is slightly bigger than my iPhone -- so it was comfortable to carry in my pockets.
The Pixel Fold, which was unveiled last month and arrives on Wednesday, is proof that when cutting-edge technology emerges, it is wiser to wait before sinking your hard-earned dollars into it. In just four years, Google has managed to erase most of the problems with foldable phones, transforming a gimmicky concept into a product with compelling reasons to exist.
What Google didn't manage to do was make foldable phone technology cheaper. The Pixel Fold costs $ 1,800, about $ 400 more than similar phones released a few years ago. Google said the device's cost partly stemmed from the engineering challenge of cramming high-quality components, including a camera on a par with other Pixel phones, into a device this thin. (When unfolded, the Pixel Fold is thinner than a typical smartphone.)
That's a bummer. Most people won't spend this much on a phone when there are many great options that are cheaper. But I can recommend it for its target audience: people with lots of disposable income who rely heavily on their devices.
Still, the progress with foldable technology is good news. A few years ago, handsets from companies like Apple and Samsung seemed to have peaked. Their flagship phones were already incredibly zippy, their screens were big and bright, and their cameras took stunning photos. The smartphone industry, as a whole, became a pile of nearly indistinguishable black rectangles.
What was left to do? In 2019, Samsung was among the first to release a foldable phone, but it poisoned the well by rushing the gadget to market. The screens on early review samples of its Galaxy Fold failed, forcing the South Korean manufacturer to postpone the product. Samsung and others have since released a few more foldable phones, but none were compelling to me.
Google's entry into the market is significant. Mirroring Apple's tight control of the iPhone's design, Google designed both the hardware (including the computing processor) and software that power the Pixel Fold. That means the device's software was tailored to work with it, and it has long battery life and very fast performance.
Beyond the bigger screen, Google has come up with clever reasons for how and why you might use a foldable phone.
For one, the Pixel Fold is a great video player to use everywhere because of the way it folds at an angle like a laptop.
When I cooked in the kitchen, I played a YouTube video with a recipe and folded the device at a 90-degree angle. The upper half of the screen showed the video, and the lower half showed the description listing the ingredients. In some ways, this was even better than a tablet, which you would have to prop up with a stand on the countertop to view at the proper angle.
What else might you do with a foldable? With the device unfolded, I ran two apps side by side, which was useful for reading a webpage while typing an email.
Google also demonstrated how its translation app could take advantage of the two screens. Consider a situation in which you, an English speaker, are trying to communicate with someone who speaks Chinese. Holding the phone unfolded, you can speak English into the microphone and have the phone's outer screen show text translated into Chinese to the other person. When the Chinese speaker responds, you can read the translated text on the inner screen.
This feature will not be released until the fall, so I didn't get to test it. But it's an intriguing use case.
In the end, the device is expensive because it is packed with advanced technology with no major trade-offs. In my tests, its camera produced crisp and vibrant images on a par with photos taken with Apple's latest iPhone and the Pixel 7 Pro, Google's $ 900 smartphone, which has an excellent camera.
Though the Pixel Fold's high price will make it inaccessible to most people, it was an exciting glimpse into the next step for smartphones. Over the last five years, as phone screens got bigger, we have voted with our wallets and shown that we prefer larger screens, so long as they come on devices easy to carry everywhere. The Pixel Fold delivers that.
I suspect that in a few years, foldable phones will probably fall in price to replace current phones with the "pro" moniker and will make up the new high end of the market. When that happens, I can see myself and many others making the switch to a foldable -- and a future where the tablet becomes less relevant.

Trapped in the Crossfire of the U.S.-China Rivalry

PARAMARIBO, Suriname — Inside his capacious office, his tan curtains drawn against the tropical sun, the president of Suriname expressed sympathy with the striking teachers who were massing outside, taunting him while demanding higher wages.
Three years of unmitigated catastrophe have destroyed spending power in this South American country — the result of global crises landing atop decades of profligate governance. Food and fuel prices have soared, worsened by Russia’s war on Ukraine. The national currency plunged, and the economy cratered just as the pandemic spread death and fear.
“The heavy burden on my people,” President Chandrikapersad Santokhi said, gave him a “moral responsibility to provide relief.”
Yet he had little to offer. The fortunes of his country of 600,000 people were caught in the geopolitical crossfire, its access to aid delayed by the conflict between the United States and China.
The next week, a delegation from the International Monetary Fund arrived from Washington to prod Santokhi’s administration to advance a round of spending cuts. Budget austerity was the central requirement for the fund’s rescue program — a three-year, $690 million package of low-interest loans designed to give Suriname the wherewithal to continue payments on $2.4 billion in foreign debt.
The IMF and its most influential participant, the United States, also wanted something else: They were adamant that Chinese creditors restructure $545 million in debt — loans Suriname had used to build roads and housing.
The challenges facing Suriname illustrate one of the new complexities in global finance. As scores of middle- and lower-income countries grapple with an intensifying debt crisis, assistance is often held up by conflict between traditionally dominant Western institutions and a significant rising player: China.
In decades past, the International Monetary Fund — a central component of the liberal democratic order forged by the United States and its allies at the end of World War II — was the only source of cash for nations that struggled to pay their bills. China has since emerged as a major lender for countries from Asia to Africa to Latin America. Its financial institutions dispense loans accompanied by few demands, providing an alternative to the austerity prescribed by the IMF.
But as strapped governments negotiate with creditors to diminish their debt burdens, the IMF and the Biden administration have balked at providing relief until Chinese financial institutions participate. Otherwise, they assert, Chinese lenders are free-riding on debt forgiveness extended by others.
“China now needs to step up as a constructive force in assisting debt-stressed countries,” Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, said during a speech in April at the Brookings Institution.
Yet an increasingly assertive Chinese government has refused to bow to Washington — not to the IMF, and not to its largest shareholder, the United States.
“The IMF gives some parameters relating to the debt relief, but for us, I think it is not binding,” said a Chinese diplomat in Paramaribo, Suriname’s capital, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so he could speak openly. “China will negotiate only with the Surinamese government.”
All of which underscores the pressures bearing on countries from Ghana to Ethiopia to Pakistan, each facing escalating debt, much of it to state-owned Chinese lenders.
Last week, the government of Zambia hailed an agreement securing a three-year reprieve on payments for $6.3 billion in debt, the bulk of it to Chinese lenders. That cleared the way for the IMF to release $188 million in relief funds under a $1.3 billion rescue package. The arrangement came only after a year and a half of torturous negotiations that left Zambia’s finances in a precarious state.
Global trouble frequently leaves lower-income countries confronting untenable financial obligations. The current wave of calamity is especially wrenching — the product of years of low interest rates, which encouraged borrowing, combined with the misery of the pandemic, which added to burdens on health care systems as economies contracted.
This time, resolution has been vexed by the evolving hostilities between the world’s two largest economies.
“If there is one obligation for the powers that be, whether it is China or the U.S., it’s to provide some certainty and security to the world,” said Suriname’s foreign minister, Albert Ramdin. “Uncertainty will create anxiety and will make countries choose sides.”
A so-called Common Framework crafted nearly three years ago by the Group of 20 nations is supposed to provide a template for what happens when countries sink into insolvency. Governments, private creditors and institutions like the IMF are to coordinate debt restructurings, allowing strapped nations to manage their future payments.
But the IMF serves as the default arbiter of the terms. With the Chinese government unwilling to assent, the system tends to seize up.
“You have new creditors that want to have a say over what the rules of the game should be,” said Daniel Munevar, a sovereign debt expert at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in Geneva.
The concerns of ordinary people in indebted nations are typically “nowhere to be seen,” Munevar added. Rather, they are subsumed by politically loaded negotiations that cater to the interests of creditors.
In Suriname, the costs are borne by families in places like the Sunny Point neighborhood, south of the capital.
Mametoen Misiedjan, 26, and her 4-month-old daughter were crammed into her mother-in-law’s two-bedroom concrete home with her three sisters-in-law and their eight children. The toddlers played in the dirt, alongside a ditch coursing with sewage.
She had moved in recently, after the rent on her own home became impossible.
Misiedjan worried about how she would pay for diapers, and whether her breast milk would be affected after she had to reduce her food portions because of mounting costs for rice, vegetables and chicken.
“I don’t have any hope left,” she said. “I sit and cry.”
The Roots of Calamity
Suriname’s modern history is largely the story of outsiders arriving in brazen pursuit of riches.
Its soil was fertile enough to entice the Dutch to secure control in the 17th century through a trade with Britain, swapping their colony of New Amsterdam — today better known as New York City.
The Dutch brought enslaved people from Western Africa and indentured laborers from Java and India to work sugar plantations.
In more recent times, Alcoa, an American aluminum-maker, erected the region’s first aluminum manufacturing complex, powered by a hydroelectric dam that also supplied cheap electricity to the populace.
When Alcoa’s domestic subsidiary shut the plant seven years ago, the government continued to distribute cheap electricity while absorbing the rising costs of production.
Those subsidies grew to staggering proportions, according to an analysis by Munevar. Here were the roots of Suriname’s debt crisis.
By 2016, the government sought help from the IMF, agreeing to a $478 million rescue package. The fund demanded that Suriname scrap subsidies for water, gas and electricity.
The country was then led by Dési Bouterse, whose legacy includes murder charges for the assassination of 15 political opponents, and an 11-year sentence on drug-trafficking charges in the Netherlands.
His government collected the first $81 million installment from the IMF, but then renounced the program and its budget strictures. Instead, he borrowed nearly $1.5 billion, much of it from Chinese creditors.
Lending from Chinese financial institutions to countries in distress has expanded drastically, reaching nearly one-fifth of the IMF’s activities, according to recent research. Almost two dozen countries facing debt crises have received more than $185 billion in such credit since 2016, the research found.
Much of this money has come as loans from China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China, and is frequently used to make payments on loans to other Chinese lenders.
Suriname secured a credit line worth about $160 million from the Chinese central bank. It tapped some of these funds to pay Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications equipment manufacturer, to upgrade a mobile telephone system. Suriname also borrowed more than $300 million from the Export-Import Bank of China, a state-owned institution that lends in support of Chinese government policies.
For a time, Suriname was able to manage its debt payments because of a rise in the price of gold, the source of more than half of the country’s export revenues.
Then came the pandemic. Commodity prices plunged, just as health care costs expanded.
Bouterse was defeated in an election in May 2020. He ceded power to a coalition government headed by Santokhi.
Santokhi inherited an economy that contracted by nearly 16% over 2020. The currency eventually lost 80% of its value.
That increased the cost of imports, from gasoline to staple foods. The inflation rate peaked at 74% in 2021, and it remains near 60%.
The amount of government revenue required to manage Suriname’s debt payments increased to 25.3% last year from 13.6% in 2022, according to Debt Justice, an advocacy organization.
That left less money for everything else.
At ‘S Lands Hospital in downtown Paramaribo, surgeries now require the improvised substitution of drugs and anesthetics to replace those that have become too expensive.
“The alarm bells are ringing,” said the hospital’s Dutch-educated medical director, Soenita Nannan Panday-Gopisingh.
Seeing no alternative, Santokhi’s government returned to the IMF.
‘Now We Are Trapped’
The fund nursed worries about reengaging with Suriname, given the debacle of the previous program. But officials were eager to support the new government.
In April 2021, IMF staff agreed to a new rescue plan that obligated Suriname to cut public spending by 10% of national economic output.
But the fund’s board did not approve the program until late December of that year, as staff sought assurances from the Chinese government that it would agree to debt relief.
“In that period, we were crushed,” said Suriname’s finance minister, Stanley Raghoebarsing.
In March 2022, the fund released another $55 million. Two months later, an IMF delegation visited Suriname and announced that the government was entitled to receive its next infusion of cash.
But the fund’s board never followed with a vote — an extraordinary deviation from the IMF process.
The delay reflected the concerns of a powerful actor: The U.S. Treasury — which handles the American relationship with the IMF — pressured the fund to withhold the money to compel China to commit to debt relief, according to two sources involved with the process.
After publication, a Treasury representative, Megan Apper, issued a statement disputing that account. “This charge is false,” the statement said.
In congressional testimony, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently described the IMF and the World Bank as “an important counterweight to nontransparent, unsustainable lending from others like China.”
That prompted a rebuke from the Chinese government. “The IMF is not the ‘International Monetary Fund of the United States,’” a foreign ministry spokesperson said at a news conference.
In May, private bondholders agreed to forgive 25% of their Surinamese debt in exchange for a guarantee of proceeds from recent offshore oil finds.
This month, the fund released another $53 million, while praising Suriname’s government for “restoring fiscal discipline.”
‘The President Is Hiding’
While officials in Washington and Beijing analyze ledgers, Suriname’s people continue to grapple with grave scarcity.
Just before 11 on a sweltering Tuesday morning in May, four dozen schoolteachers gathered alongside the muddy Suriname River, taking refuge under an almond tree. They prepared to march toward the presidential palace to demand higher wages.
Eufrazia Martin, 48, a teacher at a public high school, had seen the value of her pay reduced to $200 a month from about $800 as the national currency plunged.
She was able to feed her family with help from relatives in the Netherlands. Many of her students were less fortunate.
“There are children every day that come and say, ‘I’m hungry,’” she said.
Some children did not make it to school because their families could not afford to pay for the minibus as fares increased with the price of gas.
Some were too tired to concentrate on their studies because they were working after-school jobs to help their families.
Some girls sold themselves to men to earn money for their households, became pregnant and dropped out of school.
Martin was headed into the Cabinet office for a meeting with the president.
She and a handful of other leaders stepped into the building, as a leaden sky gave way to a downpour. Fifteen minutes later, they were back outside.
“They told us that the president could not be found,” she said as a crowd of roughly 100 protesters erupted into jeering chants.
“The president is hiding,” they hollered in Dutch.
Martin was willing to consider that the president might simply be unable to come up with any money. But she could not countenance his failure to show up.
“It’s disrespectful,” she said. “If he comes and talks to us, maybe we would understand.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Suriname, a tiny nation ravaged by recession, inflation and impossible debts, saw its relief held up by superpower politics. It won't be the only country.
Inside his capacious office, his tan curtains drawn against the tropical sun, the president of Suriname expressed sympathy with the striking teachers who were massing outside, taunting him while demanding higher wages.
Three years of unmitigated catastrophe has destroyed spending power in this South American country -- the result of global crises landing atop decades of profligate governance. Food and fuel prices have soared, worsened by Russia's war on Ukraine. The national currency plunged, and the economy cratered just as the pandemic spread death and fear.
"The heavy burden on my people," President Chandrikapersad Santokhi declared, gave him a "moral responsibility to provide relief."
Yet he had little to offer. The fortunes of his country of 600,000 people were caught in the geopolitical crossfire, its access to aid delayed by the conflict between the United States and China.
The following week, a delegation from the International Monetary Fund would arrive from Washington to prod Mr. Santokhi's administration to advance a round of spending cuts. Budget austerity was the central requirement for the fund's rescue program -- a three-year, $ 690 million package of low-interest loans designed to give Suriname the wherewithal to continue payments on $ 2.4 billion in foreign debts.
The I.M.F. and its most influential participant, the United States, also wanted something else: They were adamant that Chinese creditors restructure $ 545 million in debt -- loans Suriname had used to build roads and housing.
The challenges facing Suriname illustrate one of the new complexities in global finance. As scores of middle- and lower-income countries grapple with an intensifying debt crisis, assistance is often held up by conflict between traditionally dominant Western institutions and a significant rising player: China.
In decades past, the International Monetary Fund -- a central component of the liberal democratic order forged by the United States and its allies at the end of World War II -- was the only source of cash for nations that struggled to pay their bills. China has since emerged as a major lender for countries from Asia to Africa to Latin America. Its financial institutions dispense loans accompanied by few demands, providing an alternative to the austerity prescribed by the I.M.F.
But as strapped governments negotiate with creditors to diminish their debt burdens, the I.M.F. and the Biden administration have balked at providing relief until Chinese financial institutions participate. Otherwise, they assert, Chinese lenders are free-riding on debt forgiveness extended by others.
"China now needs to step up as a constructive force in assisting debt-stressed countries," Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, said during a speech in April at the Brookings Institution.
Yet an increasingly assertive Chinese government has refused to bow to Washington -- not to the I.M.F., and not to its largest shareholder, the United States.
"The I.M.F. gives some parameters relating to the debt relief, but for us I think it is not binding," said a Chinese diplomat in Paramaribo, Suriname's capital, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so he could speak openly. "China will negotiate only with the Surinamese government."
All of which underscores the pressures bearing on countries from Ghana to Ethiopia to Pakistan, each facing escalating debts, much of it to state-owned Chinese lenders.
Last week, the government of Zambia hailed an agreement securing a three-year reprieve on payments for $ 6.3 billion in debt, the bulk of it to Chinese lenders. That cleared the way for the I.M.F. to release $ 188 million in relief funds under a $ 1.3 billion rescue package. The arrangement came only after a year and a half of torturous negotiations that left Zambia's finances in a precarious state.
Global trouble frequently leaves lower-income countries confronting untenable financial obligations. The current wave of calamity is especially wrenching -- the product of years of low interest rates, which encouraged borrowing, combined with the misery of the pandemic, which added to burdens on health care systems as economies contracted.
This time, resolution has been vexed by the evolving hostilities between the world's two largest economies.
"If there is one obligation for the powers that be, whether it is China or the U.S., it's to provide some certainty and security to the world," said Suriname's foreign minister, Albert Ramdin. "Uncertainty will create anxiety and will make countries choose sides."
A so-called Common Framework crafted nearly three years ago by the Group of 20 nations is supposed to provide a template for what happens when countries sink into insolvency. Governments, private creditors and institutions like the International Monetary Fund are to coordinate debt restructurings, allowing strapped nations to manage their future payments.
But the I.M.F. serves as the default arbiter of the terms. With the Chinese government unwilling to assent, the system tends to seize up.
"You have new creditors that want to have a say over what the rules of the game should be," said Daniel Munevar, a sovereign debt expert at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in Geneva.
The concerns of ordinary people in indebted nations are typically "nowhere to be seen," Mr. Munevar added. Rather, they are subsumed by politically loaded negotiations that cater to the interests of creditors.
In Suriname, the costs are borne by families in places like the Sunny Point neighborhood, south of the capital.
Mametoen Misiedjan, 26, and her 4-month-old daughter were crammed into her mother-in-law's two-bedroom concrete home with her three sisters-in-law and their eight children. The toddlers played in the dirt, alongside a ditch coursing with sewage.
She had moved in recently, after the rent on her own home became impossible.
Ms. Misiedjan worried about how she would pay for diapers, and whether her breast milk would be affected after she had to reduce her food portions because of mounting costs for rice, vegetables and chicken.
"I don't have any hope left," she said. "I sit and cry."
The Roots of Calamity

By 2016, the government sought help from the IMF, agreeing to a $478 million rescue package. The fund demanded that Suriname scrap subsidies for water, gas and electricity.
The country was then led by Dési Bouterse, whose legacy includes murder charges for the assassination of 15 political opponents, and an 11-year sentence on drug-trafficking charges in the Netherlands.
His government collected the first $81 million installment from the IMF, but then renounced the program and its budget strictures. Instead, he borrowed nearly $1.5 billion, much of it from Chinese creditors.
Lending from Chinese financial institutions to countries in distress has expanded drastically, reaching nearly one-fifth of the IMF’s activities, according to recent research. Almost two dozen countries facing debt crises have received more than $185 billion in such credit since 2016, the research found.
Much of this money has come as loans from China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China, and is frequently used to make payments on loans to other Chinese lenders.
Suriname secured a credit line worth about $160 million from the Chinese central bank. It tapped some of these funds to pay Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications equipment manufacturer, to improve a mobile telephone system. Suriname also borrowed more than $300 million from the Export-Import Bank of China, a state-owned institution that lends in support of Chinese government policies.
For a time, Suriname was able to manage its debt payments because of a rise in the price of gold, the source of more than half of the country’s export revenues.
Then came the pandemic. Commodity prices plunged, just as health care costs expanded.
Bouterse was defeated in an election in May 2020. He ceded power to a coalition government headed by Santokhi.
Santokhi inherited an economy that contracted by nearly 16% over 2020. The currency eventually lost 80% of its value.
That increased the cost of imports, from gasoline to staple foods. The inflation rate peaked at 74% in 2021, and it remains near 60%.
The amount of government revenue required to manage Suriname’s debt payments increased to 25.3% last year from 13.6% in 2022, according to Debt Justice, an advocacy organization.
That left less money for everything else.
At ‘S Lands Hospital in downtown Paramaribo, surgeries now require the improvised substitution of drugs and anesthetics to replace those that have become too expensive.
“The alarm bells are ringing,” said the hospital’s Dutch-educated medical director, Soenita Nannan Panday-Gopisingh.
Seeing no alternative, Santokhi’s government returned to the IMF.
‘Now We Are Trapped’
The fund nursed worries about reengaging with Suriname, given the debacle of the previous program. But officials were eager to support the new government.
In April 2021, IMF staff agreed to a new rescue plan that obligated Suriname to cut public spending by 10% of national economic output.
But the fund’s board did not approve the program until late December of that year, as staff sought assurances from the Chinese government that it would agree to debt relief.
“In that period, we were crushed,” said Suriname’s finance minister, Stanley Raghoebarsing.
In March 2022, the fund released another $55 million. Two months later, an IMF delegation visited Suriname and announced that the government was entitled to receive its next infusion of cash.
But the fund’s board never followed with a vote — an extraordinary deviation from the IMF process.
The delay reflected the concerns of a powerful actor: The U.S. Treasury — which handles the American relationship with the IMF — pressured the fund to withhold the money to compel China to commit to debt relief, according to two sources involved with the process.
In congressional testimony, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently described the IMF and the World Bank as “an important counterweight to nontransparent, unsustainable lending from others like China.”
That prompted a rebuke from the Chinese government. “The IMF is not the ‘International Monetary Fund of the United States,’” a foreign ministry spokesperson said at a news conference.
In May, private bondholders agreed to forgive 25% of their Surinamese debt in exchange for a guarantee of proceeds from recent offshore oil finds.
This month, the fund released another $53 million, while praising Suriname’s government for “restoring fiscal discipline.”
‘The President Is Hiding’
While officials in Washington and Beijing analyze ledgers, Suriname’s people continue to grapple with grave scarcity.
Just before 11 on a sweltering Tuesday morning in May, four dozen schoolteachers gathered alongside the muddy Suriname River, taking refuge under an almond tree. They prepared to march toward the presidential palace to demand higher wages.
Eufrazia Martin, 48, a teacher at a public high school, had seen the value of her pay reduced to $200 a month from about $800 as the national currency plunged.
She was able to feed her family with help from relatives in the Netherlands. Many of her students were less fortunate.
“There are children every day that come and say, ‘I’m hungry,’” she said.
Some children did not make it to school because their families could not afford to pay for the minibus as fares increased with the price of gas.
Some were too tired to concentrate on their studies because they were working after-school jobs to help their families.
Some girls sold themselves to men to earn money for their households, became pregnant and dropped out of school.
Martin was headed into the Cabinet office for a meeting with the president.
She and a handful of other leaders stepped into the building, as a leaden sky gave way to a downpour. Fifteen minutes later, they were back outside.
“They told us that the president could not be found,” she said as a crowd of roughly 100 protesters erupted into jeering chants.
“The president is hiding,” they hollered in Dutch.
Martin was willing to consider that the president might simply be unable to come up with any money. But she could not countenance his failure to show up.
“It’s disrespectful,” she said. “If he comes and talks to us, maybe we would understand.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Biden administration is exploring whether it can mount a campaign against Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and Huawei, potentially fueling tensions with Beijing.
In the digital cold war between the United States and China, American officials are increasingly turning their attention to a new target: Chinese cloud computing giants.
Over the last 18 months, the Biden administration and members of Congress have ramped up their exploration of what can be done to address security concerns about the cloud computing divisions of Chinese tech behemoths like Alibaba and Huawei, five people with knowledge of the matter said.
American officials have discussed whether they can set tighter rules for the Chinese companies when they operate in the United States, as well as ways to counter the companies' growth abroad, three of the people said. The Biden administration has also spoken with the American cloud computing companies Google, Microsoft and Amazon to understand how their Chinese competitors operate, three other people with knowledge of the matter said.
By focusing on the Chinese cloud companies, U.S. officials are potentially widening the scope of the technological tensions between Washington and Beijing. In recent years, the United States has choked China's access to crucial technologies while trying to limit the reach of Chinese tech and telecommunication companies abroad.
Former President Donald J. Trump directed his administration toward hindering Chinese telecom equipment makers like Huawei and ZTE from playing a role in next-generation 5G wireless networks. The Trump administration also targeted Chinese-owned apps like TikTok and Grindr, forcing the sale of the latter, and began working to restrict Chinese involvement in undersea internet cables. President Biden has continued some of these efforts.
Cloud computing companies, which operate vast data centers that provide computing power and software to businesses, would become a new technological front just as China has pushed back on the U.S. roadblocks. On Monday, Wang Yi, China's top foreign affairs official, told Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken that the United States needed to stop interfering with China's technological development.
But American officials fear that Beijing could use Chinese data centers in the United States and abroad to gain access to sensitive data, echoing concerns about Chinese telecom gear and TikTok. Cloud computing is a crucial behind-the-scenes engine of the digital economy, enabling services like video streaming and allowing companies to run artificial intelligence programs.
A White House spokesman declined to comment. Huawei did not offer a comment, while Alibaba and Tencent, another Chinese tech giant with a cloud division, did not respond to requests for comment. Google, Amazon and Microsoft declined to comment.
Samm Sacks, a cyber policy fellow at the New America think tank, said the interest in cloud computing reflected the Biden administration's approach of looking at Chinese influence in the infrastructure of the internet and the digital services that use the web.
"There's an intent to focus on the whole ecosystem across those layers," she said.
U.S. efforts to hinder Chinese tech firms have had mixed success. American restrictions on suppliers to Huawei hurt the company's smartphone business, but efforts to remove Huawei equipment from wireless networks inside the United States continue. The Trump administration forced Grindr's Chinese owners to sell the app, while efforts to push the Chinese internet giant ByteDance to divest TikTok have been unsuccessful.
The global cloud computing market is substantial, with total public cloud revenues of $ 544 billion last year, according to Synergy Research Group. In the United States, Chinese companies account for a tiny fraction of the cloud market, despite having data centers in Silicon Valley and Virginia, said John Dinsdale, the chief analyst at Synergy.
But Chinese cloud companies are making inroads in Asia and Latin America. Huawei's chairman said last year that his company had seen "rapid growth" in its cloud business. In May, Huawei hosted a cloud conference in Indonesia. Alibaba convened a gathering in Mexico last year to promote its cloud products.
Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said in a statement that he was concerned that while the Federal Communications Commission could bar some Chinese companies from providing telecom services in the United States, those firms had "still been able to offer services like cloud computing." Mr. Warner wrote legislation that would give the White House more power to police Chinese technology.
In April, nine Republican senators wrote to a group of administration officials encouraging them to investigate and penalize Chinese cloud companies that they said posed a threat to national security, including Huawei, Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu.
"We urge you to use all available tools to engage in decisive action against these firms," they said.
The Commerce and State Departments have been considering how to handle the Chinese cloud computing companies, four people with knowledge of the matter said.
The Commerce Department has looked at creating tighter rules that would govern the Chinese cloud providers, two of the people said. It could create the rules under a new legal authority that allows it to restrict technologies that could pose a threat to national security.
A spokesman for the Commerce Department declined to comment.
The State Department has also started developing a strategy for raising American concerns about Chinese cloud computing providers with other countries, two people with knowledge of the matter said. The agency has already quietly brought the topic up in conversations with foreign governments, which can help diplomats understand what messages work best, one of the people said.
As many Chinese companies benefit from major government subsidies, experts fear that the Chinese cloud computing providers might be able to offer contracts below the rates of their American competitors. The U.S. government could find a way to offer foreign assistance of its own or urge American cloud providers to provide benefits to customers, like free training, to counter the Chinese companies' inducements.
A State Department spokesman said it was critical for every aspect of the global internet -- including data centers -- to be powered by trustworthy equipment. The spokesman added that the agency was also focused on reducing risks associated with wireless equipment, undersea telecom cables and satellites.

German Spy Agency Report Says China and Russia Are After Its Secrets: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The country is a growing target for foreign espionage, the agency said, amid rising tensions over the war in Ukraine and rivalries between Washington and Beijing.
Foreign intelligence services are increasingly targeting Germany, its domestic intelligence agency said on Tuesday, warning that espionage, cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns, particularly from China and Russia, "pose a serious threat" to the country.
Though such assessments are issued annually, this year's report was exceptional both for the strength of the warnings and as a measure of just how much Germany's security environment had changed in a year.
Earlier this month, the government issued a comprehensive national security strategy for the first time, part of an expanding effort to confront Germany's vulnerability to new military, economic and geopolitical threats.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine and rising global tensions with China served as a backdrop to the country's increased exposure to foreign interference, given its position both in NATO and as one of the most powerful countries in the European Union, the agency said.
"Russia's war against Ukraine also means a turning point for internal security," Germany's interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said at the news conference presenting the report from the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, as the agency is known.
Yet the report's strongest warning was reserved for China, which the agency described as "the greatest threat in terms of economic and scientific espionage."
The publication of the harsh assessment of Chinese intelligence activities came at an awkward moment for Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who on the same day was hosting the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, as part of the annual Germany-China government consultations.
The talks -- meant to renew relations between the two nations after a three-year hiatus from in-person talks during the pandemic -- come in a changed world of increasing geopolitical tensions with China over its relationship with Russia, and growing efforts by Washington and other Western governments to "de-risk" economic ties with Beijing.
The report notied that Germany in 2022 was one of China's most important targets in Europe for legal investment.
"Direct investments not only offer China the opportunity to make up for innovation deficits and achieve a technological lead, but also open the door to political influence, espionage and sabotage," the report said, warning that it could also pose risks for national security.
"The extent of these activities can also jeopardize Germany's competitiveness as an industrial and technology location and undermine the laws of the market economy," the report added. "Ultimately, this threatens to result in a loss of prosperity and, as a consequence, risks to democracy, social cohesion and Germany's independence."
The Chinese delegation, which is also meeting with German business leaders, is expected to try to persuade the government not to impose stricter restrictions on Chinese companies operating in the country.
The Chinese delegation was also likely to push against restrictions on the telecommunications firm Huawei expanding its 5G network in Germany, as the government is widely expected to do under recent laws that limit foreign investments in critical infrastructure.
Germany's political establishment remains deeply divided over the government's decision to allow the Chinese state-owned shipping company Cosco to purchase a minority stake in a terminal at the Hamburg port. Intelligence services and several ministries had advised against it.
But in two other recent cases, the government blocked Chinese purchases of two German companies involved in the semiconductor industry.
Three other countries named by the agency for increased intelligence operations were Iran, Turkey and North Korea, although much of that seemed focused on their domestic rivals based in Germany.
Thomas Haldenwang, the head of Germany's domestic intelligence agency, said that Germany and Europe had successfully intensified efforts to expel members of Russia's diplomatic corps suspected of being intelligence agents -- Germany deported 40 suspected clandestine agents from the Russian embassy last year, while overall in Europe some 400 were expelled.
More had been expelled in 2023, he noted, saying those efforts have limited Russia's espionage capacity.
Russia is likely to "act more clandestinely and aggressively in the future," Mr. Haldenwang said. "This could include the use of so-called illegals-- intelligence officers smuggled in with false identities -- as well as increased cyberattacks and even sabotage operations."
Several "illegals" have been exposed across Europe since the war in Ukraine began, though no major cases have been found in Germany so far. However, last year, Germany discovered a Russian mole in its own foreign intelligence services.
Ms. Faeser, the interior minister, said cybersecurity was "an even more acute risk for Germany."
She added that Russia would focus on "hybrid attacks," including disinformation campaigns that encouraged conspiracy theories and support for far-right groups.
The agency has for several years described the far-right as the biggest threat to German democracy, including the Alternative for Germany, known as the AfD. The agency estimated that some 10,000 of the party's 28,500 members were suspected extremists.
Even so, the party has been on the rise, reaching 20 percent in some national polls.
The rise of conspiracy theories in the wake of the pandemic has added to the potency of the far-right threat, according to analysts.
Last year, security raids foiled a planned coup attempt by a group of right-wing conspiracy theorists -- among them AfD members -- who had concocted a fantastical plot to instate a prince as the country's leader.
The plot had no known links to Russia but shows the reason for authorities' concern. The conspirators were unlikely a serious threat to Germany's government, but they were collecting weapons and planned to attack the Parliament.
At the news conference, Mr. Haldenwang was asked to describe the difference in his assessment of the intelligence risks from Russia and China.
He declined to say directly which country was a greater threat, but said: "The Russian services' approach is more robust, more visible. They work in a classical way, actually with all means known to the espionage sector. Sometimes even with means one knows only from films. Russian services do not restrain themselves in extreme consequence -- also from the killing of persons."
"This very robust way of doing something like that, we don't see that with the Chinese," he said.

China-Tied Malware Hits Systems in Guam. Is Taiwan the Real Target?: [National Desk]

Author: Sanger, David E

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The code, which Microsoft said was installed by a Chinese government hacking group, set off alarms because Guam would be a centerpiece of any U.S. military response to a move against Taiwan.
Around the time that the F.B.I. was examining the equipment recovered from the Chinese spy balloon shot down off the South Carolina coast in February, American intelligence agencies and Microsoft detected what they feared was a more worrisome intruder: mysterious computer code appearing in telecommunications systems in Guam and elsewhere in the United States.
The code, which Microsoft said was installed by a Chinese government hacking group, raised alarms because Guam, with its Pacific ports and vast American air base, would be a centerpiece of any American military response to an invasion or blockade of Taiwan. The operation was conducted with great stealth, sometimes flowing through home routers and other common internet-connected consumer devices, to make the intrusion harder to track.
The code is called a "web shell," in this case a malicious script that enables remote access to a server. Home routers are particularly vulnerable, especially older models that have not had updated software and protections.
Unlike the balloon that fascinated Americans as it performed pirouettes over sensitive nuclear sites, the computer code could not be shot down on live television. So instead, Microsoft on Wednesday published details of the code that would make it possible for corporate users, manufacturers and others to detect and remove it. In a coordinated release, the National Security Agency -- along with other domestic agencies and counterparts in Australia, Britain, New Zealand and Canada -- published a 24-page advisory that referred to Microsoft's finding and offered broader warnings about a "recently discovered cluster of activity" from China.
Microsoft called the hacking group "Volt Typhoon" and said that it was part of a state-sponsored Chinese effort aimed at not only critical infrastructure such as communications, electric and gas utilities, but also maritime operations and transportation. The intrusions appeared, for now, to be an espionage campaign. But the Chinese could use the code, which is designed to pierce firewalls, to enable destructive attacks, if they choose.
So far, Microsoft says, there is no evidence that the Chinese group has used the access for any offensive attacks. Unlike Russian groups, the Chinese intelligence and military hackers usually prioritize espionage.
In interviews, administration officials said they believed the code was part of a vast Chinese intelligence collection effort that spans cyberspace, outer space and, as Americans discovered with the balloon incident, the lower atmosphere.
The Biden administration has declined to discuss what the F.B.I. found as it examined the equipment recovered from the balloon. But the craft -- better described as a huge aerial vehicle -- apparently included specialized radars and communications interception devices that the F.B.I. has been examining since the balloon was shot down.
It is unclear whether the government's silence about its finding from the balloon is motivated by a desire to keep the Chinese government from knowing what the United States has learned or to get past the diplomatic breach that followed the incursion.
On Sunday, speaking at a news conference in Hiroshima, Japan, President Biden referred to how the balloon incident had paralyzed the already frosty exchanges between Washington and Beijing.
"And then this silly balloon that was carrying two freight cars' worth of spying equipment was flying over the United States," he told reporters, "and it got shot down, and everything changed in terms of talking to one another."
He predicted that relations would "begin to thaw very shortly."
China has never acknowledged hacking into American networks, even in the biggest example of all: the theft of security clearance files of roughly 22 million Americans -- including six million sets of fingerprints -- from the Office of Personnel Management during the Obama administration. That exfiltration of data took the better part of a year, and resulted in an agreement between President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping that resulted in a brief decline in malicious Chinese cyberactivity.
On Wednesday, China sent a warning to its companies to be alert to American hacking. And there has been plenty of that, too: In documents released by Edward Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor, there was evidence of American efforts to hack into the systems of Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, and military and leadership targets.
Telecommunications networks are key targets for hackers, and the system in Guam is particularly important to China because military communications often piggyback on commercial networks.
Tom Burt, the executive who oversees Microsoft's threat intelligence unit, said in an interview that the company's analysts -- many of them veterans of the National Security Agency and other intelligence agencies -- had found the code "while investigating intrusion activity impacting a U.S. port." As they traced back the intrusion, they found other networks that were hit, "including some in the telecommunications sector in Guam."
Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, said that covert efforts "like the activity exposed today are part of what's driving our focus on the security of telecom networks and the urgency to use trusted vendors" whose equipment has met established cybersecurity standards.
Ms. Neuberger has been spearheading an effort across the federal government to enforce new cybersecurity standards for critical infrastructure. Officials were taken by surprise by the extent of the vulnerabilities in such infrastructure when a Russian ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline in 2021 interrupted gasoline, diesel and airplane fuel flow on the East Coast. In the wake of the attack, the Biden administration used little-known powers of the Transportation Security Administration -- which regulates pipelines -- to force private-sector utilities to follow a series of cybersecurity mandates.
Now Ms. Neuberger is driving what she called a "relentless focus on improving the cybersecurity of our pipelines, rail systems, water systems and other critical services," including the mandates on cybersecurity practices for these sectors and closer collaboration with companies with "unique visibility" into threats to such infrastructure.
Those firms include Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and many telecommunications firms that can see activity on domestic networks. Intelligence agencies, including the N.S.A., are forbidden by law from operating inside the United States. But the N.S.A. is permitted to publish warnings, as it did on Wednesday, alongside the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security's Cyber Infrastructure and Security Administration.
The agency's report is part of a relatively new U.S. government move to publish such data quickly in hopes of burning operations like the one mounted by the Chinese government. In years past, the United States usually withheld such information -- sometimes classifying it -- and shared it with only a select few companies or organizations. But that almost always assured that the hackers could stay well ahead of the government.
In this case, it was the focus on Guam that particularly seized the attention of officials who are assessing China's capabilities -- and its willingness -- to attack or choke off Taiwan. Mr. Xi has ordered the People's Liberation Army to be capable of taking the island by 2027. But the C.I.A. director, William J. Burns, has noted to Congress that the order "does not mean he has decided to conduct an invasion."
In the dozens of U.S. tabletop exercises conducted in recent years to map out what such an attack might look like, one of China's first anticipated moves would be to cut off American communications and slow the United States' ability to respond. So the exercises envision attacks on satellite and ground communications, especially around American installations where military assets would be mobilized.
None is bigger than Guam, where Andersen Air Force Base would be the launching point for many of the Air Force missions to help defend the island, and a Navy port is crucial for American submarines.

WASHINGTON — Around the time that the FBI was examining the equipment recovered from the Chinese spy balloon shot down off the South Carolina coast in February, U.S. intelligence agencies and Microsoft detected what they feared was a more worrisome intruder: mysterious computer code appearing in telecommunications systems in Guam and elsewhere in the United States.
The code, which Microsoft said was installed by a Chinese government hacking group, raised alarms because Guam, with its Pacific ports and vast U.S. air base, would be a centerpiece of any U.S. military response to an invasion or blockade of Taiwan. The operation was conducted with great stealth, sometimes flowing through home routers and other common internet-connected consumer devices, to make the intrusion harder to track.
The code is called a “web shell” — in this case, a malicious script that enables remote access to a server. Home routers are particularly vulnerable, especially older models that have not had updated software and protections.
Unlike the balloon that fascinated Americans as it performed pirouettes over sensitive nuclear sites, the computer code could not be shot down on live television. So instead, Microsoft on Wednesday published details of the code that would make it possible for corporate users, manufacturers and others to detect and remove it. In a coordinated release, the National Security Agency — along with other domestic agencies and counterparts in Australia, Britain, New Zealand and Canada — published a 24-page advisory that referred to Microsoft’s finding and offered broader warnings about a “recently discovered cluster of activity” from China.
Microsoft called the hacking group “Volt Typhoon” and said that it was part of a state-sponsored Chinese effort aimed at not only critical infrastructure such as communications, electric and gas utilities but also maritime operations and transportation. The intrusions appeared, for now, to be an espionage campaign. But the Chinese could use the code, which is designed to pierce firewalls, to enable destructive attacks, if they choose.
So far, Microsoft said, there is no evidence that the Chinese group has used the access for any offensive attacks. Unlike Russian groups, the Chinese intelligence and military hackers usually prioritize espionage.
In interviews, administration officials said they believed the code was part of a vast Chinese intelligence collection effort that spans cyberspace, outer space and, as Americans discovered with the balloon incident, the lower atmosphere.
The Biden administration has declined to discuss what the FBI found as it examined the equipment recovered from the balloon. But the craft — better described as a huge aerial vehicle — apparently included specialized radars and communications interception devices that the FBI has been examining since the balloon was shot down.
It is unclear whether the government’s silence about its finding from the balloon is motivated by a desire to keep the Chinese government from knowing what the United States has learned or to get past the diplomatic breach that followed the incursion.
On Sunday, speaking at a news conference in Hiroshima, Japan, President Joe Biden referred to how the balloon incident had paralyzed the already frosty exchanges between Washington and Beijing.
“And then this silly balloon that was carrying two freight cars’ worth of spying equipment was flying over the United States,” he told reporters, “and it got shot down, and everything changed in terms of talking to one another.”
He predicted that relations would “begin to thaw very shortly.”
China has never acknowledged hacking into U.S. networks, even in the biggest example of all: the theft of security clearance files of roughly 22 million Americans — including 6 million sets of fingerprints — from the Office of Personnel Management during the Obama administration. That exfiltration of data took the better part of a year and resulted in an agreement between President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping that resulted in a brief decline in malicious Chinese cyberactivity.
On Wednesday, China sent a warning to its companies to be alert to U.S. hacking. And there has been plenty of that, too: In documents released by Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, there was evidence of U.S. efforts to hack into the systems of Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, and military and leadership targets.
Telecommunications networks are key targets for hackers, and the system in Guam is particularly important to China because military communications often piggyback on commercial networks.
Tom Burt, the executive who oversees Microsoft’s threat intelligence unit, said in an interview that the company’s analysts — many of them veterans of the NSA and other intelligence agencies — had found the code “while investigating intrusion activity impacting a U.S. port.” As they traced back the intrusion, they found other networks that were hit, “including some in the telecommunications sector in Guam.”
Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, said that covert efforts “like the activity exposed today are part of what’s driving our focus on the security of telecom networks and the urgency to use trusted vendors” whose equipment has met established cybersecurity standards.
Neuberger has been spearheading an effort across the federal government to enforce new cybersecurity standards for critical infrastructure. Officials were taken by surprise by the extent of the vulnerabilities in such infrastructure when a Russian ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline in 2021 interrupted gasoline, diesel and airplane fuel flow on the East Coast. In the wake of the attack, the Biden administration used little-known powers of the Transportation Security Administration — which regulates pipelines — to force private-sector utilities to follow a series of cybersecurity mandates.
Now Neuberger is driving what she called a “relentless focus on improving the cybersecurity of our pipelines, rail systems, water systems and other critical services,” including the mandates on cybersecurity practices for these sectors and closer collaboration with companies with “unique visibility” into threats to such infrastructure.
Those firms include Microsoft, Google, Amazon and many telecommunications firms that can see activity on domestic networks. Intelligence agencies, including the NSA, are forbidden by law from operating inside the United States. But the NSA is permitted to publish warnings, as it did Wednesday, alongside the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security’s Cyber Infrastructure and Security Administration.
The agency’s report is part of a relatively new U.S. government move to publish such data quickly in hopes of burning operations like the one mounted by the Chinese government. In years past, the United States usually withheld such information — sometimes classifying it — and shared it with only a select few companies or organizations. But that almost always assured that the hackers could stay well ahead of the government.
In this case, it was the focus on Guam that particularly seized the attention of officials who are assessing China’s capabilities — and its willingness — to attack or choke off Taiwan. Xi has ordered the People’s Liberation Army to be capable of taking the island by 2027. But the CIA director, William Burns, has noted to Congress that the order “does not mean he has decided to conduct an invasion.”
In the dozens of U.S. tabletop exercises conducted in recent years to map out what such an attack might look like, one of China’s first anticipated moves would be to cut off U.S. communications and slow the U.S.’ ability to respond. So the exercises envision attacks on satellite and ground communications, especially around U.S. installations where military assets would be mobilized.
None is bigger than Guam, where Andersen Air Force Base would be the launching point for many of the Air Force missions to help defend the island, and a Navy port is crucial for U.S. submarines.

Biden Foresees 'Thaw' With China, Even as G7 Rattles Beijing: [News Analysis]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: During the Group of 7 meeting that just wrapped up, President Biden forged a consensus approach toward China despite tensions between the major powers over their approach.
President Biden and his allies spent much of the G7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, announcing new arms packages for Ukraine, including a pathway to providing F-16 fighter planes. They spent hours discussing strategy with President Volodymyr Zelensky for the next phase of a hot war started by Russia.
So it was easy to miss Mr. Biden's prediction on Sunday of a coming "thaw" in relations with Beijing, as both sides move beyond what he called the "silly" Chinese act of sending a giant surveillance balloon over the United States, only the most recent in a series of incidents that have fueled what seems like a descent toward confrontation.
It is far too early to say whether the president's optimism is based on the quiet signals he has received in behind-the-scenes meetings with the Chinese government in recent weeks.
Mr. Biden's own aides see a struggle underway in China between factions that want to restart the economic relationship with the United States and a far more powerful group that aligns with President Xi Jinping's emphasis on national security over economic growth. As this weekend showed, China is enormously sensitive to any suggestion that the West is organizing a challenge to Beijing's growing influence and power.
So if Mr. Biden is right, it may take awhile for the ice to melt.
Facing a new, unified set of principles from the major Western allies and Japan on how to protect their supply chains and their key technology from Beijing -- contained in the meeting's final communiqué -- China erupted in outrage.
Beijing denounced what it portrayed as a cabal seeking to isolate and weaken Chinese power. The Japanese ambassador to Beijing was called in for a reaming out, and China moved to ban products from Micron Technology, an American chip maker, on the grounds that its products posed a security risk to the Chinese public. It seemed like exactly the kind of "economic coercion" the world leaders had just vowed to resist.
Mr. Biden often says he has no desire to see a new Cold War begin with China. And he points out that the economic interdependencies between Beijing and the West are so complex that the dynamic between the two countries is entirely different from what it was when he was delving into foreign policy for the first time as a newly elected senator, 50 years ago.
The harmony in Hiroshima over developing a common approach, and the blasts from Beijing that followed, suggested that Mr. Biden had made progress on one of his top foreign policy priorities despite underlying tension among the allies. Rather than dwell on their disagreements, the leaders of the major industrial democracies lined up their approach to China in a way that Beijing clearly saw as potentially threatening, some analysts noted after the meeting.
"One indication that Washington would be pleased is that Beijing is so displeased," said Michael Fullilove, the executive director of the Lowy Institute, a research group in Sydney, Australia.
Matthew Pottinger, a deputy national security adviser to President Donald J. Trump and the architect of that administration's approach to China, agreed. "The fact Beijing was so touchy about the G7 statements is an indicator the allies are moving in the right direction."
Mr. Biden and the other leaders of the G7 -- which includes Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan -- wrote their first joint statement of principles about how they would resist economic blackmail and dissuade China from threatening or invading Taiwan, while trying to reassure Beijing that they were not seeking confrontation.
The communiqué pressed China on the usual stress points, including its military buildup in the South China Sea and the widely documented human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang. Four months after the United States quietly began distributing intelligence to the European allies suggesting that China was considering sending arms to Russia to fuel its fight in Ukraine, the document seemed to be a warning to Beijing against pressing its "no limits" relationship with Russia too far.
Yet the democracies also left the door open to improving relations with Beijing by making clear that they were not attempting a strategy of Cold War containment against the world's ascendant economy, even as they seek to cut China off from key technologies -- including the European-made machinery critical to producing the most advanced semiconductors in the world.
"Our policy approaches are not designed to harm China nor do we seek to thwart China's economic progress and development," the communiqué said. "A growing China that plays by international rules would be of global interest. We are not decoupling or turning inwards. At the same time, we recognize that economic resilience requires de-risking and diversifying."
"De-risking" is the new term of art, created by the Europeans, to describe a strategy of reducing their dependence on Chinese supply chains without "decoupling," a far more severe separation of economic relations. Mr. Biden's team has embraced the phrase, and the strategy -- meant to sound self-protective rather than punitive -- has become a staple of the recent conversation about how to deal with Beijing. Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, talks of "building a high fence around a small yard" to describe the protection of key technologies that could bolster China's rapid military buildup.
But what looks like risk reduction to the United States and Europe can look like a nicely worded containment strategy in Beijing.
The consensus reached in Hiroshima came after what Michael J. Green, a former top Asia adviser to President George W. Bush, called "a string of diplomatic wins for the U.S. and losses for China." Mr. Biden has worked behind the scenes to promote a rapprochement between South Korea and Japan, and is planning to integrate Japan into a consultative group on nuclear strategy and deterrence that was announced during a state visit last month by President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea. If successful, it would create a far tighter nuclear alliance in China's neighborhood.
"From Beijing's perspective, this has been a week of even closer alignment among the other powers in the region with the United States," said Mr. Green, now the chief executive of the United States Studies Center at the University of Sydney.
China pushed back hard. In a statement issued over the weekend, it accused the G7 of "obstructing international peace," "vilifying and attacking China" and "crudely meddling in China's domestic affairs." The same day, it accused Micron of "relatively serious cybersecurity problems" that could threaten national security, the same argument the United States makes about TikTok and Huawei.
Despite the common ground in Hiroshima, Mr. Biden's decision to cancel the second half of his trip to the Pacific, including a stop in Papua New Guinea, so he could rush home to deal with domestic spending and debt negotiations, was taken as a setback in the competition with China.
Now the question is whether, quietly, Mr. Biden can rebuild a relationship with Mr. Xi that seemed to be turning around last fall, after their first face-to-face meeting.
Mr. Biden referred to the spy balloon incident in interesting ways on Sunday.
"And then this silly balloon that was carrying two freight cars' worth of spying equipment was flying over the United States, and it got shot down, and everything changed in terms of talking to one another," he said. "I think you're going to see that begin to thaw very shortly."
If there is a turnaround, it may result from the quiet talks that Mr. Sullivan held in Vienna this month with Wang Yi, China's top foreign policy official.
The sessions were hardly warm, but in some ways they were more candid and useful than American officials had expected. Rather than simply a recitation of talking points, as is typical of encounters with Chinese counterparts, Mr. Wang spoke in more unscripted terms than usual, according to officials familiar with the talks. There was an airing of grievances on both sides that the Biden team hoped would help clear the air.
There were long conversations in particular about Ukraine and Taiwan. Mr. Wang emphasized that China was not seeking conflict with Taiwan, apparently trying to assuage American officials who last summer feared that China might accelerate its plans to resolve its dispute over Taiwan by force.
Mr. Wang raised the need to avoid precipitous actions surrounding elections in Taiwan early next year. Mr. Sullivan pressed the point that China's own conduct was raising the temperature and increasing the risk of escalation.
Administration officials hope to return to a more regular dialogue with China, perhaps sending Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo to China, and eventually rescheduling a trip to Beijing by Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, who canceled a visit after the spy balloon episode. There is talk of a meeting between Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi in the fall.
But the war in Ukraine will continue to shadow the relationship -- and so will the course of the relationship between Moscow and Beijing, what one of Mr. Biden's aides calls "the alliance of the aggrieved." Yet for the moment, U.S. officials have taken solace that China has not, so far as they know, provided lethal weapons to Russia despite President Vladimir V. Putin's need for armaments.

China's Ban on Micron Escalates Microchip War: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A Chinese government block on Micron Technology's memory chips marks how far apart the two economic powers are drifting on tech policy.
When cutting foreign technology companies from Chinese supply chains, Beijing has long chosen to work obliquely or even secretly. Regulators would give executives back-room lectures, weigh them down with excessive red tape or hit them with occasional office raids. Rarely did the government tell a firm outright it was no longer welcome.
But that is what it signaled to Micron Technology in a late-night announcement on Sunday.
The Chinese government barred companies that handle critical information from buying microchips made by the Boise, Idaho-based Micron. The company's chips, which are used for memory storage in all kinds of electronics, like phones and computers, were deemed to pose "relatively serious cybersecurity problems" by China's internet watchdog after a review.
Micron said it was "evaluating" the government's finding and "assessing" what it would do next. Analysts said the company, which has been selling chips in China for years, could find itself cut out of future business from Chinese companies.
The openness and speed with which the Chinese authorities took action against Micron -- they spent less than two months on the investigation -- underscore how far apart the two sides are drifting on tech policy. Last year, the Biden administration took harsh steps to block Chinese chip makers' access to crucial tools needed to make advanced chips, as well as access to the chips that run supercomputers and craft powerful artificial intelligence algorithms.
The Micron action, widely seen as a reprisal for those moves, shows some of China's advantages over the United States: a speedy, and feared, authoritarian rule that can quickly pronounce and enforce absolute bans. It also offers a glimpse of new tactics by Beijing.
With the block of Micron, the authorities carved out a space in the industry that Chinese chip makers could fill. The move could also present a new wedge between the United States and its allies, whose companies could make billions of dollars in sales if they were to step in and pick up business that Micron might lose.
For Beijing, hurting an American company that makes critical equipment advances the government's goal of boosting its domestic tech sector.
"It may not be feasible or necessary to completely replace all products with domestic ones, but for these core products, we need to develop our own capabilities and avoid being overly dependent," said Xiang Ligang, a director of a Beijing technology consortium who has advised the Chinese government on technology issues. "This applies not only to the chip industry but also to other sectors," he added.
For the better part of a decade, China and the United States have jockeyed over global technological leadership. Chinese computer hacks of American firms, and policies designed to acquire closely held intellectual property, raised red flags in Washington. In Beijing, revelations from Edward J. Snowden, the former U.S. intelligence contractor, exposed the vulnerability in relying too much on American tech.
As each side maneuvered to find new advantages, both came to focus on the semiconductor industry. The tiny microchips that do the thinking for just about all electronics were a convenient choke point for the United States, which worked to cut off China's access to the smallest and fastest chips. The hope was to make China's supercomputers less smart and its smartphones less salable.
To counter Washington, China lavished subsidies on domestic chip leaders. While they failed to catch up to global rivals in the arena of the most advanced chips, some firms succeeded with less sophisticated parts, like memory chips and larger logic chips that work in cheaper smartphones and cars.
Then the Biden administration in October announced a major set of policies aimed at China's most successful semiconductor companies. The move, along with billions in new subsidies for chip production in the United States, were viewed dimly by Chinese policymakers, said Paul Triolo, the senior vice president for China at Albright Stonebridge Group, a strategy advisement firm.
"Officials in Beijing over the past months have been complaining to anyone who will listen about U.S. actions," he said. "Beijing views these moves as primarily politically driven and is now willing to go tit for tat," Mr. Triolo added.
In some ways, China is better equipped for that exchange. China's authoritarian system enables quick action and guarantees that few domestic firms will break with policy.
In the United States, political debate and legal challenges can dull the sharpness of government efforts. Major American companies, for instance, found legal workarounds to Washington's attempts to cut component sales to companies like the Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei. Some multinationals successfully lobbied for licenses to allow them to keep selling to blacklisted companies.
By targeting Micron specifically, China is hitting at one of the few sectors -- memory chips -- that it has a toehold in with its chip competition with the United States.
While protecting such success by barring American competitors makes strategic sense, China remains very reliant on the United States for advanced chips, according to Teng Tai, an economist and the director of the Wanbo New Economic Research Institute in Beijing.
"The ultimate goal of retaliating against Micron is to urge certain American companies to restrain themselves, so we could further promote technology and trade cooperation, and avoid pursuing an isolated and self-reliant approach," he wrote Monday on Weibo, a Chinese social media outlet.
Another question that Sunday's action against Micron raises is how the United States' ally South Korea will respond. Its companies, in particular Samsung and SK Hynix, have the most to gain from the Micron ban. The two companies stand to pick up customers from Micron, which reported $ 3.3 billion in sales in China in 2022.
Mr. Xiang, the Chinese government adviser, said: "Why should South Korea blindly follow the United States and harm its own interests? I don't think South Korea has such an obligation."

“One indication that Washington would be pleased is that Beijing is so displeased,” said Michael Fullilove, the executive director of the Lowy Institute, a research group in Sydney.
Matthew Pottinger, a former deputy national security adviser to President Donald Trump, and the architect of that administration’s approach to China, agreed. “The fact Beijing was so touchy about the G-7 statements is an indicator the allies are moving in the right direction.”
Biden and the other leaders of the G-7 — which includes Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan — wrote their first joint statement of principles about how they would resist economic blackmail and dissuade China from threatening or invading Taiwan, while seeking to reassure Beijing that they were not seeking confrontation.
The communiqué pressed China on the usual stress points, including its military buildup in the South China Sea and the widely documented human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang. Four months after the United States quietly began distributing intelligence to the European allies suggesting that China was considering sending arms to Russia to fuel its fight in Ukraine, the document seemed to be a warning to Beijing against pressing its “no limits” relationship with Russia too far.
Yet the democracies also left the door open to improving relations with Beijing by making clear that they were not attempting a strategy of Cold War containment against the world’s ascendant economy, even as they seek to cut China off from key technologies — including the European-made machinery critical to producing the most advanced semiconductors in the world.
“Our policy approaches are not designed to harm China nor do we seek to thwart China’s economic progress and development,” the communiqué said. “A growing China that plays by international rules would be of global interest. We are not decoupling or turning inwards. At the same time, we recognize that economic resilience requires de-risking and diversifying.”
“De-risking” is the new term of art, created by the Europeans, to describe a strategy of reducing their dependence on Chinese supply chains without “decoupling,” a far more severe separation of economic relations. Biden’s team has embraced the phrase, and the strategy — meant to sound self-protective rather than punitive — has become a staple of the recent conversation about how to deal with Beijing. Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, talks of “building a high fence around a small yard” to describe the protection of key technologies that could bolster China’s rapid military buildup.
But what looks like risk reduction to the United States and Europe can look like a nicely worded containment strategy in Beijing.
The consensus reached in Hiroshima came after what Michael J. Green, a former top Asia adviser to President George W. Bush, called “a string of diplomatic wins for the U.S. and losses for China.” Biden has worked behind the scenes to promote a rapprochement between South Korea and Japan, and is planning to integrate Japan into a consultative group on nuclear strategy and deterrence that was announced during a state visit last month by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol. If successful, it would create a far tighter nuclear alliance in China’s neighborhood.
“From Beijing’s perspective, this has been a week of even closer alignment among the other powers in the region with the United States,” said Green, now the chief executive of the United States Studies Center at the University of Sydney.
China pushed back hard. In a statement issued over the weekend, it accused the G-7 of “obstructing international peace,” “vilifying and attacking China” and “crudely meddling in China’s domestic affairs.” The same day it accused Micron of “relatively serious cybersecurity problems” that could threaten national security, the same argument the U.S. makes about TikTok and Huawei.
Despite the common ground in Hiroshima, Biden’s decision to cancel the second half of his trip to the Pacific, including a stop in Papua New Guinea, so he could rush home to deal with domestic spending and debt negotiations, was taken as a setback in the competition with China.
Now the question is whether, quietly, Biden can rebuild a relationship with Xi that seemed to be turning around last fall, after their first face-to-face meeting.
Biden referred to the spy balloon incident in interesting ways on Sunday.
“And then this silly balloon that was carrying two freight cars’ worth of spying equipment was flying over the United States, and it got shot down, and everything changed in terms of talking to one another,” he said. “I think you’re going to see that begin to thaw very shortly.”
If there is a turnaround, it may result from the quiet talks that Sullivan held in Vienna this month with Wang Yi, China’s top foreign policy official.
The sessions were hardly warm, but in some ways they were more candid and useful than American officials had expected. Rather than simply a recitation of talking points, as is typical of encounters with Chinese counterparts, Wang spoke in more unscripted terms than usual, according to officials familiar with the talks. There was an airing of grievances on both sides that the Biden team hoped would help clear the air.
There were long conversations in particular about Ukraine and Taiwan. Wang emphasized that China was not seeking conflict with Taiwan, apparently trying to assuage American officials who last summer feared that China might accelerate its plans to resolve its dispute over Taiwan by force.
Wang raised the need to avoid precipitous actions surrounding elections in Taiwan early next year. Sullivan pressed the point that China’s own conduct was raising the temperature and increasing risk of escalation.
Administration officials hope to return to a more regular dialogue with China, perhaps sending Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo to China, and eventually rescheduling a trip to Beijing by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who canceled a visit after the spy balloon episode. There is talk of a meeting between Biden and Xi in the fall.
But the war in Ukraine will continue to shadow the relationship — and so will the course of the relationship between Moscow and Beijing, what one of Biden’s aides calls “the alliance of the aggrieved.” Yet for the moment, U.S. officials have taken solace that China has not, so far as they know, provided lethal weapons to Russia despite President Vladimir Putin’s need for armaments.

Growing Trade Restrictions Force New Business Plans And Altered Supply Chains: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Seven months after Washington unveiled tough curbs, Chinese companies are doubling down on homegrown supply chains and drawing billions in cash from Beijing and investors.
Last October, construction plans for a hulking semiconductor factory owned by a major state-backed company in central China fell into disarray. The Biden administration had escalated the trade war over technology, severing China's access to the Western tools and skilled workers it needed to build the most advanced semiconductors.
Some employees with U.S. citizenship departed the company. Three U.S. equipment suppliers almost immediately halted their shipments and services, and Europe and Japan are expected to do the same soon.
The facility belonged to Yangtze Memory Technologies Corporation, or YMTC, a memory chip company that Xi Jinping, China's president, has extolled as a flag-bearer in China's race toward self-reliance. Now, the chip maker and its peers are hurriedly overhauling supply chains and rewriting business plans.
Nearly seven months later, the U.S. trade barriers have accelerated China's push for a more independent chip sector. Western technology and money have pulled out, but state funding is flooding in to cultivate homegrown alternatives to produce less advanced but still lucrative semiconductors. And China has not given up on making high-end chips: Manufacturers are attempting to work with older parts from abroad not blocked by the U.S. sanctions, as well as less advanced equipment at home.
The tough U.S. restrictions stemmed from alarm over what officials in Washington viewed as the threat posed by China's use of its technology companies to upgrade its military arsenal. Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, recently characterized the sentiment as part of a "new consensus" in Washington that decades of economic integration with China was not wholly successful, adding that the new controls were "carefully tailored" to go after China's most cutting-edge semiconductors.
Under the October rules, American enterprises and citizens may no longer aid any Chinese companies building chip technology that meets a certain threshold of sophistication. The controls went beyond Trump administration trade curbs that went after specific companies like the Chinese telecom giant Huawei.
During those earlier trade tensions, Beijing mobilized vast sums to cultivate homegrown alternatives to Western chip makers. But foreign components were readily available and of higher quality, leaving many Chinese firms unwilling to make the switch.
Those reservations about using materials from China appear to be easing. Chinese tech companies up and down the supply chain are assessing how to replace Western chips and related components, even those unaffected by U.S. controls. Guangzhou Automobile Group, a state-owned electric vehicle manufacturer, said in February that it aimed to eventually purchase all of its roughly 1,000 chips in its cars from Chinese providers. It currently buys 90 percent of its chips from overseas.
"The goal now in China in a lot of areas is to de-Americanize supply chains," said Paul Triolo, the senior vice president for China at Albright Stonebridge Group, a strategy firm.
Dozens of Chinese chip companies are finalizing plans to raise money through public offerings this year. They include China's second-largest chip manufacturer, Hua Hong Semiconductor, as well as a chip tool maker backed by Huawei.
The technology disputes between the world's two largest economies show no signs of abating. The Biden administration has drafted, but not yet released, new rules that would restrict American venture capital investments in advanced chip companies in China. Foreign investment into China's semiconductor sector this year has already tumbled to $ 600 million, its lowest point since 2020, according to data from PitchBook, which tracks private financing. And officials are mulling tighter controls on technologies like quantum computing or chip manufacturing equipment.
U.S. restrictions have caused Beijing to activate a state fund that had been dormant because of waste and graft: The government's "Big Fund" injected roughly $ 1.9 billion into YMTC in February to bolster its response to the U.S. restrictions. The fund has also recently put money into chip equipment and material suppliers, according to state media reports.
The new subsidies aim to remove Western components from China's supply chains. The southern city of Guangzhou has earmarked over $ 21 billion this year for semiconductor and other tech projects including those that attempt to replace Western chip equipment suppliers. Purchase orders for Chinese-made equipment have spiked in recent months, according to corporate reports and press statements.
Mr. Xi has been outspoken about what he sees as an effort by Western countries to enforce an "all-around containment" of China. During an important legislative meeting in March, the Chinese president interrupted remarks by a delegate from a Chinese crane manufacturer. The exchange was widely reported by state media: "The chips inside your cranes, are they locally sourced?" Mr. Xi asked. Yes, the delegate said.
So far, less than 1 percent of all semiconductors in China are at the industry's top end that are subject to U.S. controls, according to estimates from Yole Group, a market research firm. The rest are less advanced, or "mature," semiconductors, found in everyday consumer electronics and cars, and are "the vast majority of the business," said Jean-Christophe Eloy, the chief executive of Yole Group. Those chips, largely untouched by the Biden administration's October controls, are now seeing a surge of investment, he added.
China's two largest chip manufacturers, the state-backed Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, or SMIC, and Hua Hong Semiconductor have each announced billions of dollars this year to expand production into mature chips, according to public announcements.
Yet over the long term, China's lack of access to world-class tools needed to make chips could stymie its progress in many advanced industries like artificial intelligence and aerospace, according to Handel Jones, the chief executive of International Business Strategies, a consulting firm.
Last August, YMTC had targeted a three fold increase in its share of global chip production to 13 percent by 2027, challenging chip incumbents like U.S.-based Micron Technology, according to Yole Group's estimates. Facing trouble building out its second factory, the Chinese memory chip maker's production is set to decline, sliding to just 3 percent of the market in 2027.
International companies that had previously invested in China's semiconductor industry are diverting their investments elsewhere. Korea and Taiwan's leading chip manufacturers, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, are investing billions of dollars into new production in the United States. The Taiwanese chip-maker is applying for U.S. subsidies for its Arizona factory that force it to cap its investment into China for a decade.
At the same time, experts said, the weakening of foreign influence over China's chip sector is creating opportunity for domestic companies. Last month, a semiconductor equipment manufacturer went public in Shanghai. Shares of the company, Crystal Growth & Energy Equipment, have climbed 30 percent since its debut.
"It's because of the sanctions that there's now space in the market," said Xiang Ligang, a director of a Beijing-based technology consortium who has advised the Chinese government on technology issues. "Now we have a chance to develop."
The recent burst of state cash could supercharge China's share of global production in lower-end chips. In the next decade, China could account for roughly half of the world's production capacity for a class of mature semiconductors, according to a jointly written report by Rhodium Group, a consulting firm, and Stiftung Neue Verantwortung, a think tank in Berlin.
That could create new supply chain vulnerabilities for foreign companies, said Jan-Peter Kleinhans, a co-author of the report.
"Putting all of your eggs in one basket is a stupid idea," he explained. "This is a choke point that can be exploited."

Retaliation After Canada Expels Envoy From China: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: China ordered a Canadian diplomat in Shanghai to leave after Ottawa expelled a Chinese official who had been accused of gathering information on a Canadian lawmaker.
A major diplomatic rift erupted between Canada and China on Tuesday as Beijing expelled a Canadian diplomat in a tit-for-tat move just hours after Ottawa said it had ordered a Chinese envoy to leave amid allegations of influence peddling.
On Monday night, Canada said it had declared a Chinese diplomat who had been accused of intimidating and gathering information on a Canadian lawmaker "persona non grata," and ordered him to leave. Hours later, China said it was retaliating by expelling a diplomat from the Canadian consulate in Shanghai.
Reports of a Chinese influence campaign have rocked Canada in recent months. The Globe and Mail newspaper and other prominent Canadian news organizations have published a series of articles describing intelligence reports that accuse the Chinese government and its diplomats in Canada of trying to manipulate the last two elections to ensure that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party won.
The goal, according to the reports: prevent a victory by the Conservative Party, which the Chinese viewed as taking a hard line toward Beijing. The reports set off a political firestorm, raising questions about the integrity of Canada's democracy. China has denied the claims.
An independent report, made public in March, concluded that while China, Russia and Iran had tried to interfere in the 2019 and 2021 elections, they had no effect on the results.
In a statement on Monday, Mélanie Joly, Canada's foreign minister, said that the decision to boot the diplomat, Zhao Wei, was made "after careful consideration of all factors at play."
"Diplomats in Canada have been warned that if they engage in this type of behavior, they will be sent home," she added. "We will not tolerate any form of foreign interference."
The Globe, citing a top-secret document from 2021, also reported that Mr. Zhao had been involved in gathering information about Michael Chong, a Conservative member of Parliament, and his family in China in a possible effort to "make an example" of him.
In 2021, Mr. Chong drew the ire of Beijing for sponsoring a motion to declare China's treatment of its Uyghur Muslim minority a genocide. Beijing then imposed sanctions against Mr. Chong, barring him from entering the country and prohibiting Chinese citizens from conducting business with him.
That year, a report by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service on a possible Chinese influence campaign also included information about potential threats to Mr. Chong.
China's Consulate in Toronto, where Mr. Zhao is based and listed as the head of the intergovernmental and media office, said in a statement last week, "The claim has no factual basis and is totally groundless."
It was not clear if Mr. Zhao had been given a deadline to leave the country.
Describing Canada's move as "unscrupulous," China retaliated by ordering Jennifer Lalonde, a diplomat at the Canadian Consulate in Shanghai, to leave no later than Saturday. In a statement, China's foreign ministry also said that Beijing "reserves the right to further react."
Diplomatic expulsions are not common. In 2018, Canada joined Western allies in booting Russian envoys in the wake of accusations that Kremlin agents used a nerve agent to poison a former Russian spy, Sergei V. Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia Skripal, 33.
After Ms. Joly's announcement, Mr. Chong told reporters, "It shouldn't have taken two years for the government to make this decision."
He has said he was "profoundly disappointed" to find out about the potential threat to his family from a newspaper, and criticized Mr. Trudeau's government for inaction. He had persistently called for Mr. Zhao's expulsion since the Globe's report.
After Mr. Trudeau said he had not been aware of accusations that Chinese diplomats were targeting Canadian lawmakers, Mr. Chong responded on Twitter last week, "This is a complete failure of leadership on part of the PM."
Tensions between Ottawa and Beijing have flared before, perhaps most notably in December 2018, when Canada arrested a top executive of the telecommunications firm Huawei at the request of the United States.
China retaliated by detaining two Canadian citizens, who were released after the Huawei executive, Meng Wanzhou, reached a deal to return to China.

In Tech Cold War, Rural Telecoms Struggle to Purge Chinese Gear: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Deep in a pine forest in Wilcox County, Ala., three workers dangled from the top of a 350-foot cellular tower. They were there to rip out and replace Chinese equipment from the local wireless network.
Three hours into the job, the team ran into a hitch. Replacement gear from a European company was obstructing a safety beacon for airplanes. "We've got a problem," a crew member on the ground said. "They say it's blocking the beacon."
The project had already been delayed for months because of storms, slow equipment shipments and labor shortages. The new snafu, discovered early this month, would add at least two more days and blow the budget, said John Nettles, the president of the family-owned Pine Belt Cellular, who was standing at the base of the tower.
"People in Washington think it's easy to just swap out the equipment, but there are always problems you didn't expect, always more expenses and always delays," he said.
As the United States and China battle for geopolitical and technological primacy, the fallout has reached rural Alabama and small wireless carriers in dozens of states. They are on the receiving end of the Biden administration's sweeping policies to suppress China's rise, which include trade restrictions, a $ 52 billion package to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing against China and the divestiture of the video app TikTok from its Chinese owner.
What the wireless carriers must do, under a program known as "rip and replace," has become the starkest physical manifestation of the tech Cold War between the two superpowers. The program, which took effect in 2020, mandates that American companies tear out telecom equipment made by the Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. U.S. officials have warned that gear from those companies could be used by Beijing for espionage and to steal commercial secrets.
Instead, U.S. carriers have to use equipment from non-Chinese companies. The Federal Communications Commission, which oversees the program, would then reimburse the carriers from a pot of $ 1.9 billion intended to cover their costs.
Similar rip-and-replace efforts are taking place elsewhere. In Europe, where Huawei products have been a key part of telecom networks, carriers in Belgium, Britain, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden have also been swapping out the Chinese equipment because of security concerns, according to Strand Consult, a research firm that tracks the telecom industry.
"Rip-and-replace was the first front in a bigger story about the U.S. and China's decoupling, and that story will continue into the next decade with a global race for A.I. and other technologies," said Blair Levin, a former F.C.C. chief of staff and a fellow at the Brookings Institution.
But cleansing U.S. networks of Chinese tech has not been easy. The costs have already ballooned above $ 5 billion, according to the F.C.C., more than double what Congress appropriated for reimbursements. Many carriers also face long supply chain delays for new equipment.
The program's burden has fallen disproportionately on smaller carriers, which relied more on the cheaper gear from the Chinese firms than large companies like AT&T and Verizon. Given rip-and-replace's difficulties, some smaller wireless companies now say they may not be able to upgrade their networks and continue serving their communities, where they are often the only internet providers.
"For many rural communities, they are faced with the disastrous choice of having to continue to use insecure networks that are ripe for surveillance or having to cut off their services," said Geoffrey Starks, a Democratic commissioner at the F.C.C.
Last month, Senator Deb Fischer, a Republican of Nebraska, introduced a bill to close the gap in rip-and-replace funding for carriers. Passing it will be challenging, with similar legislation failing twice over the past year and fierce debate in Washington over government spending and the debt ceiling. But "we have to follow up," Ms. Fischer said. "Some of these carriers could go out of business."
The scrutiny of Chinese telecom companies goes back more than a decade. In 2012, a Congressional committee issued a report on Huawei and ZTE warning of the companies' ties to Beijing. In 2019, former President Donald J. Trump restricted U.S. companies from selling goods to the Chinese firms, while the F.C.C. banned companies that receive federal subsidies from buying Huawei and ZTE equipment. The agency expanded those restrictions last year to limit all imports from the Chinese companies.
Rip-and-replace rolled out after Congress passed a law in January 2020 creating the reimbursement effort. But costs from the program quickly soared.
In January, the F.C.C. said it had received 126 applications seeking funding beyond what it could reimburse. Lawmakers had underestimated the costs of shredding Huawei and ZTE equipment, and new equipment and labor costs have risen. The F.C.C. said it could cover only about 40 percent of the expenses.
Some wireless carriers immediately paused their replacement efforts. "Until we have assurance of total project funding, this project will continue to be delayed as we await the necessary funding required to build and pay for the new network equipment," United Wireless of Dodge City, Kan., wrote in a regulatory filing to the F.C.C. in January.
Huawei declined to comment; ZTE didn't respond to a request for comment.
In southern Alabama's Black Belt region, known for its historical cotton plantations and paper mills, complying with rip-and-replace has been a central initiative at Pine Belt Cellular, one of the few wireless carriers for 2,000 homes and businesses in five counties.
The company was founded in 1958 by James Nettles, a country doctor in Arlington who installed phone lines into the homes of patients so they could call him for home visits.
After James Nettles's son, John Nettles, joined the phone business in 1988, the family expanded into wireless service with federal grants. In 2011, John Nettles took additional F.C.C. subsidies and upgraded Pine Belt's network to include broadband for fast internet service.
Six equipment manufacturers pitched their gear to him, he said. Mr. Nettles chose ZTE because the company offered equipment at less than half the cost of other bids. Pine Belt initially bought $ 5 million in ZTE equipment, including hundreds of antennas, radios and other gear for its 67 cell towers.
The F.C.C. "told me to find the cheapest equipment, and no one thought twice about ZTE being Chinese," he said.
But since restrictions on ZTE gear were introduced, Mr. Nettles has spent most of his time trying to replace it with equipment from Western companies like Nokia and Microsoft.
At Pine Belt's central networking hub, a windowless cinder block building in downtown Selma, seven large metal bins recently overflowed with ZTE servers, processors and switches, the gear that moves internet traffic around and connects calls. There were also racks of new Nokia and Microsoft equipment and Dell computers. The Chinese and Western-made technology will operate simultaneously until Pine Belt can completely rid its cell towers of ZTE equipment.
In 2021, Pine Belt applied for $ 68 million in reimbursements from the F.C.C. for the replacement effort. But last July, the agency said that it could only refund costs of up to $ 27 million. Pine Belt is about 15 percent into its transition away from Chinese equipment and is already $ 5 million over the F.C.C.'s budget, Mr. Nettles said.
Early this month, Mr. Nettles drove 15 miles to a rusting 300-foot tower where two workers were preparing to tear out Chinese gear. Rigged with ropes and pulleys, they planned to climb the tower to assess if it could hold the weight of an additional three antennas and radio equipment from Nokia.
The workers decided they had to pour cement under the tower to create a stronger base for the additional load. The tower will have to hold the old ZTE and new Nokia equipment during the rip-and-replace work to prevent any service interruptions.
As Mr. Nettles parked near the tower, a customer in Selma called to complain that his cell service was cutting in and out. The customer was between one tower with ZTE equipment and another with Nokia equipment.

China's Diplomatic Tour of Europe Is Disrupted by Beijing's Ties to Moscow: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A three-stop tour by China's foreign minister this week has everyone trying to balance economic and security interests when it comes to Russia and Ukraine.
China's top diplomat set out on a three-nation trip Tuesday to persuade European leaders that they can do business with Beijing, even as the Chinese tried to keep faith with their "unlimited partnership" with a Russia that has plunged Europe into war.
But arriving in Berlin, Foreign Minister Qin Gang was quickly confronted about the war in Ukraine.
"Neutrality means taking the side of the aggressor, and that is why our guiding principle is to make it clear that we are on the side of the victim," the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, declared at a joint news conference after they met. Beijing, she said, could be doing much more to help bring the war to an end.
Mr. Qin defended his nation's approach. "The Ukraine issue is of high complexity," he insisted. "China did not cause this, nor is it a party, but we are committed to peace negotiations."
He said that China would continue to seek a cease-fire and pledged that it would "neither watch the fire from the other bank nor add fuel to the fire."
The Chinese foreign minister may find the going a little easier on the next leg of his trip, in France. France's president, Emmanuel Macron, has been eager to maintain both business and diplomatic ties with Beijing. Last month, he made his own journey to China, and some of his comments there alarmed his American and European allies.
Mr. Macron said that Europe should be pursuing its own interests and "strategic autonomy" and "not get caught up in crises that are not ours." He suggested that the fate of Taiwan was not a central issue for Europe, and argued that Europe should not blindly follow the United States in its rivalry with China.
Even if some read too much into Mr. Macron's words, they were music to Chinese ears, given Beijing's goal of trying to divide Europe from the United States. In Berlin on Tuesday, Mr. Qin hit some the same themes that Mr. Macron did.
"China supports Europe's self-chosen development path, supports its European strategic autonomy, and it also maintains a steady and stable European policy," he said.
Caught between wanting to support Russia, woo Europe and stabilize relations with its most important rival, the United States, China has proposed a set of weak proposals for a possible peace between Russia and Ukraine. Few take them very seriously, especially with the fighting likely to intensify soon, but some officials and analysts suggest that China may prove useful down the road in helping guarantee any cease-fire or settlement.
China's leader, Xi Jinping, is seen as one of the few voices that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia might heed. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has also spoken with Mr. Xi, who phoned him last month after much urging from the Ukrainian leader.
But senior European and American officials do not believe that either Mr. Putin or Mr. Zelensky is ready for serious peace talks, or even that Mr. Xi is willing to press Mr. Putin for peace. They believe that China, given its rivalry with the United States, is eager for Mr. Putin not to be seen as losing his war and thereby risk losing power.
Much will depend, as ever, on the situation on the battlefield after Ukraine wages a much-anticipated counteroffensive. Even if Ukraine gains considerable ground, U.S. and European officials do not expect Russian troops to collapse or to flee from all sovereign Ukrainian territory. But if Ukraine has great success, it may be more willing to discuss a settlement.
It is less clear that Mr. Putin will have any interest in doing so, believing that time is on his side, with the United States and the larger NATO alliance growing tired of the long war.
On Tuesday, Mr. Qin, who after France was to travel to Norway, emphasized Europe's key economic ties to China.
"China should be a key asset for Europe in combating challenges," he said, "and we welcome Europe to further participate in the market and development opportunities of China, so that both Chinese modernization and the European integration process continue to prosper."
As the European Union considers another package of sanctions aimed at companies that supply Russia through third countries, like Azerbaijan and Georgia, Mr. Qin warned against imposing sanctions on Chinese companies over Russia, saying it would take action to protect their interests.
The proposed sanctions could touch a number of Chinese companies, but Mr. Qin said that Chinese and Russian companies enjoy "normal exchanges and cooperation" which "should not be affected."
Tensions with China are hardly limited to Europe.
When the U.S. ambassador to Beijing, Nicholas Burns, met on Monday with Mr. Qin, their exchanges were polite but pointed; it was their first meeting since relations were frozen by the dispute over the Chinese surveillance balloon that was shot down over the United States in February.
Mr. Qin told Mr. Burns that "the agenda of dialogue and cooperation agreed by the two sides has been disrupted, and the relationship between the two countries has once again hit the cold ice," according to a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement. But stabilizing ties with Washington remains a "top priority," he said.
In a brief post on Twitter, Mr. Burns said that the two men had discussed "challenges in the U.S.-China relationship and the necessity of stabilizing ties and expanding high-level communication."
The same day, Canada expelled a Chinese diplomat, Zhao Wei, who was based in Toronto. Canada said that Mr. Zhao had tried to intimidate a Canadian member of Parliament, Michael Chong, and his relatives in Hong Kong after Mr. Chong accused China of human rights abuses.
In response, China on Tuesday ordered the expulsion of Jennifer Lynn Lalonde, Canada's diplomat in its Shanghai consulate and said that "China reserves the right to further react."
Diplomatic relations between the two countries have been strained since the detention of a Huawei Technologies executive, Meng Wanzhou, who was held in Canada on U.S. fraud charges in 2018, and Beijing's subsequent arrest of two Canadians on spying charges. All three were freed in 2021.
At the time, China insisted the two cases were not linked, but critics accused Beijing of using the Canadians as political bargaining chips.

‘Rip and Replace’: The Tech Cold War Is Upending Wireless Carriers

ARLINGTON, Ala. — Deep in a pine forest in Wilcox County, Alabama, three workers dangled from the top of a 350-foot cellular tower. They were there to rip out and replace Chinese equipment from the local wireless network.
Three hours into the job, the team ran into a hitch. Replacement gear from a European company was obstructing a safety beacon for airplanes. “We’ve got a problem,” a crew member on the ground said. “They say it’s blocking the beacon.”
The project had already been delayed for months because of storms, slow equipment shipments and labor shortages. The new snafu, discovered early this month, would add at least two more days and blow the budget, said John Nettles, the president of the family-owned Pine Belt Cellular, who was standing at the base of the tower.
“People in Washington think it’s easy to just swap out the equipment, but there are always problems you didn’t expect, always more expenses and always delays,” he said.
As the United States and China battle for geopolitical and technological primacy, the fallout has reached rural Alabama and small wireless carriers in dozens of states. They are on the receiving end of the Biden administration’s sweeping policies to suppress China’s rise, which include trade restrictions, a $52 billion package to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing against China and the divestiture of the video app TikTok from its Chinese owner.
What the wireless carriers must do, under a program known as “rip and replace,” has become the starkest physical manifestation of the tech Cold War between the two superpowers. The program, which took effect in 2020, mandates that U.S. companies tear out telecom equipment made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. U.S. officials have warned that gear from those companies could be used by Beijing for espionage and to steal commercial secrets.
Instead, U.S. carriers have to use equipment from non-Chinese companies. The Federal Communications Commission, which oversees the program, would then reimburse the carriers from a pot of $1.9 billion intended to cover their costs.
Similar rip-and-replace efforts are taking place elsewhere. In Europe, where Huawei products have been a key part of telecom networks, carriers in Belgium, Britain, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden have also been swapping out the Chinese equipment because of security concerns, according to Strand Consult, a research firm that tracks the telecom industry.
“Rip-and-replace was the first front in a bigger story about the U.S. and China’s decoupling, and that story will continue into the next decade with a global race for AI and other technologies,” said Blair Levin, a former FCC chief of staff and a fellow at the Brookings Institution.
But cleansing U.S. networks of Chinese tech has not been easy. The costs have already ballooned above $5 billion, according to the FCC, more than double what Congress appropriated for reimbursements. Many carriers also face long supply chain delays for new equipment.
The program’s burden has fallen disproportionately on smaller carriers, which relied more on the cheaper gear from the Chinese firms than large companies like AT&T and Verizon. Given rip-and-replace’s difficulties, some smaller wireless companies now say they may not be able to upgrade their networks and continue serving their communities, where they are often the only internet providers.
“For many rural communities, they are faced with the disastrous choice of having to continue to use insecure networks that are ripe for surveillance or having to cut off their services,” said Geoffrey Starks, a Democratic commissioner at the FCC.
Last month, Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., introduced a bill to close the gap in rip-and-replace funding for carriers. Passing it will be challenging, with similar legislation failing twice over the past year and fierce debate in Washington over government spending and the debt ceiling. But “we have to follow up,” Fischer said. “Some of these carriers could go out of business.”
The scrutiny of Chinese telecom companies goes back more than a decade. In 2012, a Congressional committee issued a report on Huawei and ZTE warning of the companies’ ties to Beijing. In 2019, former President Donald Trump restricted U.S. companies from selling goods to the Chinese firms, while the FCC banned companies that receive federal subsidies from buying Huawei and ZTE equipment. The agency expanded those restrictions last year to limit all imports from the Chinese companies.
Rip-and-replace rolled out after Congress passed a law in January 2020 creating the reimbursement effort. But costs from the program quickly soared.
In January, the FCC said it had received 126 applications seeking funding beyond what it could reimburse. Lawmakers had underestimated the costs of shredding Huawei and ZTE equipment, and new equipment and labor costs have risen. The FCC said it could cover only about 40% of the expenses.
Some wireless carriers immediately paused their replacement efforts. “Until we have assurance of total project funding, this project will continue to be delayed as we await the necessary funding required to build and pay for the new network equipment,” United Wireless of Dodge City, Kansas, wrote in a regulatory filing to the FCC in January.
Huawei declined to comment; ZTE didn’t respond to a request for comment.
In southern Alabama’s Black Belt region, known for its historical cotton plantations and paper mills, complying with rip-and-replace has been a central initiative at Pine Belt Cellular, one of the few wireless carriers for 2,000 homes and businesses in five counties.
The company was founded in 1958 by James Nettles, a country doctor in Arlington, Alabama, who installed phone lines into the homes of patients so they could call him for home visits.
After James Nettles’ son, John Nettles, joined the phone business in 1988, the family expanded into wireless service with federal grants. In 2011, John Nettles took additional FCC subsidies and upgraded Pine Belt’s network to include broadband for fast internet service.
Six equipment manufacturers pitched their gear to him, he said. Nettles chose ZTE because the company offered equipment at less than half the cost of other bids. Pine Belt initially bought $5 million in ZTE equipment, including hundreds of antennas, radios and other gear for its 67 cell towers.
The FCC “told me to find the cheapest equipment, and no one thought twice about ZTE being Chinese,” he said.
But since restrictions on ZTE gear were introduced, Nettles has spent most of his time trying to replace it with equipment from Western companies like Nokia and Microsoft.
At Pine Belt’s central networking hub, a windowless cinder block building in downtown Selma, Alabama, seven large metal bins recently overflowed with ZTE servers, processors and switches, the gear that moves internet traffic around and connects calls. There were also racks of new Nokia and Microsoft equipment and Dell computers. The Chinese and Western-made technology will operate simultaneously until Pine Belt can completely rid its cell towers of ZTE equipment.
In 2021, Pine Belt applied for $68 million in reimbursements from the FCC for the replacement effort. But last July, the agency said that it could only refund costs of up to $27 million. Pine Belt is about 15% into its transition away from Chinese equipment and is already $5 million over the FCC’s budget, Nettles said.
Early this month, Nettles drove 15 miles to a rusting 300-foot tower where two workers were preparing to tear out Chinese gear. Rigged with ropes and pulleys, they planned to climb the tower to assess if it could hold the weight of an additional three antennas and radio equipment from Nokia.
The workers decided they had to pour cement under the tower to create a stronger base for the additional load. The tower will have to hold the old ZTE and new Nokia equipment during the rip-and-replace work to prevent any service interruptions.
As Nettles parked near the tower, a customer in Selma called to complain that his cell service was cutting in and out. The customer was between one tower with ZTE equipment and another with Nokia equipment.
“The ZTE and Nokia equipment aren’t communicating well with each other,” Nettles tried to explain. “Sorry about the inconvenience.”

British Banking Giant Fights to Stay in One Piece as Top Shareholder Pushes for Global Revamp: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The global bank's biggest shareholder, the giant Chinese insurer Ping An, wants HSBC to spin off its profitable Asian operation.
For many investors, HSBC, Europe's largest lender with a venerable place in Britain's banking industry, offers little to critique: It is performing well and has focused on its most profitable and fastest-growing operations, those in Asia.
But for the firm's largest investor, the sprawling Chinese insurance giant Ping An, that isn't enough.
Over the past year, Ping An has waged a campaign to convince HSBC to spin off its Hong Kong-based operations in some way, cracking open the bank's global empire to improve its financial performance. It's a move that HSBC's board has strongly resisted as costly and ineffective.
The clash will come to a head at HSBC's annual shareholder meeting in the English city of Birmingham on Friday, where investors will vote on two proposals backed by Ping An, including one that would push the bank to regularly consider revamping its global structure.
Those initiatives face long odds, even with Ping An owning an 8 percent stake. Influential investor advisory firms oppose the measures, and HSBC's latest financial results were strong, reporting earnings that greatly exceeded expectations. But Ping An, which first invested in HSBC in 2017, has shown little inclination to walk away.
From its founding in 1865 in Hong Kong, HSBC was meant to bridge east and west. Since then, it has moved its headquarters to Britain and expanded its financial reach worldwide, with nearly $ 3 trillion in assets putting it in the top 10 largest global banks.
Still, the company continues to draw nearly half of its revenue from customers in Asia, including Hong Kong and mainland China, with the remainder coming from Europe, the Middle East and North America. And it has moved to sell operations in less important markets, including retail banking in Canada and the United States.
That uniquely strong presence by a Western bank in the growing Asian markets puts HSBC on strong footing, particularly as China's economy re-emerges from pandemic lockdowns.
But to Ping An and some other investors, the bank hasn't done enough to bolster its China-facing businesses, instead siphoning off money from them to buttress slower-growing operations in the West. Especially galling to those shareholders was HSBC's halting of its stock dividend payments in early 2020, after the Bank of England barred British banks from paying them to conserve capital during the pandemic.
The insurer is also worried about HSBC being hurt by geopolitical tensions between Beijing and the West. The bank was criticized in China for aiding the United States prosecution of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the telecommunications giant Huawei. But it has also drawn rebuke by American lawmakers for freezing the accounts of pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, at the behest of local authorities, and for the then-head of HSBC's Asia operation publicly supporting a Beijing-imposed national security law in the territory.
Ping An is a behemoth in its own right: It is the world's largest insurance company, but also offers health care and banking. It has pressed HSBC executives to consider various ways of breaking off its Asian operations, only to be repeatedly rebuffed. Last month, it threw its support behind shareholder proposals to require HSBC to regularly review its structure and to restore its dividend to prepandemic levels.
"We have been extremely disappointed by HSBC management's consistent closed-minded attitude to all solutions," Michael Huang, the chief executive of Ping An's asset management arm, said in a statement.
In a concession to HSBC management's objections, Ping An has proposed listing the bank's Hong Kong arm as a separate publicly traded company, while letting HSBC maintain a majority stake.
Even then, the bank said it remained unconvinced. That stance was backed by shareholder advisory firms that counsel investors on how to vote in corporate elections. One of them, Institutional Shareholder Services, cited a "lack of detailed rationale commensurate with the implications of the proposal" in recommending a rejection of the plan.
Days before Friday's annual meeting, HSBC's first-quarter earnings report probably earned further support from other investors. The lender said its profit surpassed investor expectations: After-tax earnings more than tripled from a year ago, to $ 11 billion, on the back of higher interest income and onetime accounting gains.
"It's hard to pick holes" in the results, Perlie Mong, a research analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said in a telephone interview. "It's a very strong beat."
Of more importance to restive shareholders was HSBC's pledge to buy back up to $ 2 billion of its shares -- a move to help drive up the share price -- and resume paying a quarterly dividend for the first time since 2019. The bank's chief executive, Noel Quinn, suggested the lender could return more money to investors and cited the results as proof of a winning strategy.
"I believe our first-quarter results reinforce our recommendations and demonstrate that our current strategy is the fastest and safest way to improve returns," Mr. Quinn told analysts on Tuesday.
In a statement, Ping An said the positive results were the result of accounting measures and interest rate rises, and said it still supported the shareholder proposals.

Lula Isn't Trying to Make Brazil a Pariah. He's Just Being Pragmatic.: [Op-Ed]

Full text: SÃO PAULO, Brazil -- Under Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil was an international pariah. Not my words, but those of the former foreign minister: Apparently it was "good to be an outcast." I do not miss these people.
When Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took office in January, after defeating Mr. Bolsonaro, it was widely hoped that he would guide Brazil back to the international mainstream. The early signs were good: In November, even before assuming the presidency, Mr. Lula traveled to COP27 in Egypt, and there was an amiable visit to the United States in February. Then Mr. Lula started going off script. In a frantic few weeks, he made efforts to initiate peace talks on Ukraine, criticized the supremacy of the U.S. dollar, traveled to China and hosted Russia's foreign minister.
Many in the West have been outraged, with one commentator accusing him of offering "political support for anti-American despots." It's a tempting view, especially when Mr. Lula -- as he did while in China -- paints Russia and Ukraine as equally responsible for the war. But all the same, it is mistaken. Taken together, Mr. Lula's moves amount less to an attempt to thwart the West than to advance Brazil's national interests, as well as a commitment to alleviate poverty and hunger in the Global South. In line with the country's history of multilateralism and sensitive to its needs, Mr. Lula is charting his own course.
China is the big one. Mr. Lula's visit to Beijing in April, where he met President Xi Jinping amid much fanfare, put several noses out of joint. But the visit, coming after trips to Argentina and Uruguay, was surely to be expected. China, after all, is Brazil's top trade partner, importing enormous quantities of iron ore, soybeans and, increasingly, meat. For its part, Brazil imports from China, well, pretty much everything -- like pesticides, semiconductors and shiny trinkets and gadgets that fill our dollar stores.
Economic interest alone could explain the trip. But Mr. Lula made plain that he had other motives for the visit. "We have political interests," he said, "and we are interested in building a new geopolitics so that people can change the governance of the world." The comment was of a piece with a previous obsession of Mr. Lula's, when he was president from 2003 to 2010, to shake up the perceived Western dominance of international institutions such as the World Trade Organization and secure greater representation for developing countries in the United Nations. In this project, China is an obvious ally.
Mr. Lula's itinerary showed the centrality of this concern. Before all else, his first appointment was to watch his successor as leader of Brazil in 2011, Dilma Rousseff, take office as the president of the New Development Bank in Shanghai. Popularly known as the bank of the BRICS -- the acronym for the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- the institution aims to act as a counterweight to the wealthy nations of the Global North. In his accompanying speech, Mr. Lula claimed it could "free emerging countries from submission to the traditional financial institutions that intend to govern us," pointedly criticizing the International Monetary Fund.
This is the heart of the matter. To many leaders of developing countries, the global financial system -- overseen by the I.M.F. and the World Bank and administered in U.S. dollars -- serves to squeeze poorer nations, locking them into debt repayment programs and forestalling investment in infrastructure and welfare. At the New Development Bank ceremony, Mr. Lula said he asks himself "every night" why all countries are forced to do their trade backed by the dollar. While that sounds like a recipe for bad sleep, the concern is not in itself unreasonable.
Much more worrying was the free pass Mr. Lula seemed to give China. It's one thing to proclaim, as he did after a visit to Huawei's research center in Shanghai, that "we have no prejudice in our relationship with the Chinese." But it's another altogether to declare that Taiwan is not an independent state while saying nothing about human rights violations or state surveillance. Such silence shows that Mr. Lula's approach, generally described as a return to pragmatism, has its moral costs.
Yet Mr. Lula is also drawing on a Brazilian tradition in foreign policy, based on the principles of multilateralism, nonintervention and the peaceful settlement of conflicts. That's what lies behind his refusal to sell weapons to Ukraine and efforts to convene a "peace club" of neutral nations to mediate talks between Ukraine and Russia.
A just end to the brutal war in Ukraine is to be desired, of course, but Mr. Lula has gone about his aim strangely. He has accused the United States of "stimulating the war" and the European Union of not talking about peace -- and even said that "the two countries decided to go to war," implying that Ukraine was also to blame for the conflict. In April he suggested that Ukraine could hand over Crimea to end the war.
Such comments have not gone unnoticed. Russia's foreign minister, on a tour of Latin America that controversially included Brazil, expressed his gratitude. Others were less pleased. A U.S. official accused Mr. Lula of "parroting Russian and Chinese propaganda," and an E.U. spokesman reiterated that Russia was the only one to blame. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry spokesman, while diplomatic, made clear his unhappiness.
Chastened, Mr. Lula soon backed down, underlining that his government "condemns the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity." Even so, he continued to advocate a "negotiated political solution" to the war and reiterated his concern "about the global consequences of this conflict." There's no reason to think he's being disingenuous. For food security, peace and sustainable development -- in Brazil and the world over -- Mr. Lula seems willing to forfeit the good will of his democratic friends in the West.
Brazil is a pariah no more. Instead, it's a pragmatist.

New York's Transit Agency Stops Updating on Twitter
Real-time train delays, bus route changes and other service information that would be vital to millions of New York City commuters will no longer be shared on Twitter because the "reliability of the platform can no longer be guaranteed," a Metropolitan Transportation Authority official said on Thursday.
The M.T.A. is the latest big-name account to make significant adjustments to how it uses the platform, after recent changes under its new owner, Elon Musk.
"The M.T.A. has terminated posting service information to Twitter, effective immediately," Shanifah Rieara, the agency's acting chief customer officer, said in a news release. Ms. Rieara said information can be found through the MYmta and TrainTime apps, the M.T.A.'s website, email alerts and text messages.
The M.T.A. said it was not abandoning Twitter altogether. Its account will remain active for branding and other messaging. DERRICK BRYSON TAYLOR

ChatGPT Meets Demands Of Regulators in Italy
ChatGPT's maker said Friday that the chatbot is available again in Italy after the company met the demands of regulators who temporarily blocked it over privacy concerns. OpenAI said it fulfilled a raft of conditions that the Italian data protection authority wanted satisfied by an April 30 deadline to have the ban lifted.
"ChatGPT is available again to our users in Italy," San Francisco-based OpenAI said by email. "We are excited to welcome them back, and we remain dedicated to protecting their privacy."
Last month, the Italian watchdog, known as Garante, ordered OpenAI to temporarily stop processing Italian users' personal information while it investigated a possible data breach. The authority said it didn't want to hamper AI's development but emphasized the importance of following the EU's strict data privacy rules.
OpenAI said it "addressed or clarified the issues" raised by the watchdog.

After Regrouping, Huawei Reports Modest Profits
Chinese tech giant Huawei reported Friday that its revenue edged up 0.8 percent from a year earlier in 2023's first three months and the company was profitable.
Revenue rose to 132.1 billion yuan ( $ 19.1 billion), a company statement said. It said its net profit margin was 2.3 percent, down from 4.3 percent a year earlier.
Huawei Technologies Ltd., China's first global tech brand, has struggled since then-President Donald Trump cut off access to U.S. processor chips and other technology in a feud with Beijing over technology and security. American officials say the company is a security risk and might facilitate Chinese spying, which Huawei denies.
The company is the biggest global maker of network equipment for phone and internet companies. It switched its emphasis last year to selling technology to automakers, factories, mines and other industrial customers.

Dealmakers Complain of Regulators' Unpredictability: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: When Megamergers Fall Apart
British antitrust regulators on Wednesday blocked Microsoft's $ 69 billion bid to buy the gaming giant Activision Blizzard, threatening to kill the deal entirely. The ruling raises a broader question: How often do deals fall apart after they're signed?
So far this year, just 33 out of 3,347 bids to buy an American company have been withdrawn. Some of the deals may have been signed in previous years, as was the case for the Activision takeover, which was announced last year. In 2022, nearly 12,000 such deals were announced, totaling $ 170 billion, and 142 were withdrawn.
A transaction can fall apart for any number of reasons, but when regulators step in to stop a merger, it's generally because they have concerns the deal would have a detrimental effect on consumers, or the country at large. Regulators have increasingly been making their case: The number of pulled transactions last year was its highest in 20 years though that may be in part because 2021 had a record number of deals.
One consequence of greater regulatory scrutiny, dealmakers say, is a chill on deal-making: The value of deals announced in 2022 dropped nearly 60 percent from the year prior, though activity in 2021 was notably at a high level.
Dealmakers say it has become increasingly difficult to anticipate when the authorities might move to block a deal or to approve it. This uncertainty is particularly high for companies looking to buy emerging technologies, like those in cloud gaming, as was the case with Microsoft and Activision.
In the United States, there have been a number of headline-grabbing deals that regulators under President Biden have successfully blocked. They include Penguin Random House's plans to buy Simon & Schuster, and the merger of the insurance giants Aon and Willis Towers Watson, both last year.
Global regulators have been stepping in, too, even for deals involving companies headquartered outside their borders, as Britain did with Microsoft and Activision. The European Union's competition authority last year moved to block the biotechnology company Illumina's acquisition of Grail, despite the fact Illumina says Grail has no business in Europe.
Deals can fall apart over national security concerns, too. Broadcom's acquisition of its rival chip maker, Qualcomm, fell apart after a U.S. government panel argued the deal would give an edge to Chinese companies like Huawei.
Some companies appear willing to place their bets on deals making it through tough inspection. The Justice Department has sued to prevent JetBlue's acquisition of Spirit Airlines, in a move that had been widely expected given how consolidated the airline industry is already. The two airlines plan to defend their merger, as they push for an outcome similar to UnitedHealth Groups' purchase of Change Healthcare, after both companies convinced a U.S. District Court judge to overrule a Justice Department suit seeking to block the deal.
Companies seeking mergers know there is a risk the deal will never come to fruition, which is why many contracts include some sort of protection, like a fee that one party pays to the other if regulators break it up. Companies have also been building in longer timelines to close their deals in an effort to fight possible regulatory pushback.
But Britain's move to stop Microsoft's bid to buy Activision comes as big technology companies are facing heat and the economic backdrop has made financing deals more difficult. That could point to an even tougher year ahead for what was already a slowing market for deals.

Xi Mocks U.S. As He Warms To Its Friends: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: China has rebuffed calls to restart high-level talks with the United States, raising the risk of confrontation in contested areas like the Taiwan Strait.
China's top leader, Xi Jinping, has rolled out the red carpet for President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil, lauding him as "an old friend of the Chinese people." He has sipped tea in a garden with President Emmanuel Macron of France, treating him to a performance on an ancient Chinese zither. And he has talked on the phone with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, offering well wishes for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
But even as Mr. Xi has offered a glad hand to those and other world leaders in recent weeks, it has been only the cold shoulder for the United States. China has rebuffed attempts by the Biden administration to restart high-level talks and lower tensions over Taiwan. And Mr. Xi's government has intensified a campaign of ridicule and criticism of the United States and Western democracy.
Taken together, the efforts to shore up ties with American allies while publicly discrediting the United States reflect Beijing's hardening position as relations sink to their lowest point in decades over what Mr. Xi has described as Washington's "containment, encirclement and suppression of China."
The two-pronged approach, some analysts say, is compelling evidence that Mr. Xi has fully committed to the view that engagement between China and the United States is fruitless, at least for now. And it has lent urgency to concerns that the two powers are on a collision course that could lead to dangerous accidents, or even war, over Taiwan and other geopolitical flash points.
Mr. Xi's diplomatic effort was rebuffed by the United States and some of its closest allies this week, when a meeting of top Group of 7 diplomats gathered in Japan and vowed to address China's growing assertiveness together. But Mr. Xi has still been getting some of the reaction he and other Chinese officials had hoped for in recent months, visually chipping at some of the alliances that underpin Washington's influence.
During Mr. Xi's meeting with Mr. Lula, the Brazilian leader railed against the continued dominance of the U.S. dollar in trade and paid a visit to a research center for China's telecommunications giant, Huawei, which is under sanctions from the United States. Mr. Macron hailed European autonomy and warned against being dragged by the United States into a war over Taiwan. And Prince Mohammed praised China's growing "constructive role" in the Middle East, a not so subtle dig at the United States and its strained relationships in the region.
At the same time, Chinese state media has railed against the "perils" and "abuse" of American hegemony and criticized the United States on human rights, racism and gun violence. It has seized on the leaked Pentagon documents to highlight how Washington has been spying on its allies. And it has mocked the Biden administration for holding a summit on democracy last month, describing U.S. democracy as "troubled," "messy" and "in constant decline."
Beijing's harsher line reflects its frustrations over a series of U.S. moves, particularly in relation to Taiwan, the self-governing island claimed by China. Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-wen, visited the United States earlier this month and met with Kevin McCarthy, the speaker of the House of Representatives. On Monday, Taiwan said it had clinched a deal to buy up to 400 U.S. anti-ship missiles to help counter a potential Chinese invasion.
Then there are the joint military drills the United States is conducting with the Philippines, the largest in decades.
Those moves compound deeper resentments that center on U.S. restrictions of advanced semiconductor exports to China and growing security ties between the United States and countries on China's periphery such as Japan, South Korea, Australia and India.
To Chinese officials, American pleas for renewed diplomatic engagement -- including a long-awaited call between Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi -- ring hollow in the face of what they view as rising hostility and provocations. High-level talks can only proceed after the United States has demonstrated "credible sincerity with concrete actions," Chinese state media said last week.
"The responsibility for the current difficulties in China-U.S. relations does not lie with China," Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said recently when asked about resuming dialogue with Washington and the potential rescheduling of a visit to Beijing by Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken that was called off after the emergence of a suspected high altitude Chinese spy balloon over the continental United States in February.
"The U.S. needs to stop interfering in China's internal affairs and harming China's interests, and stop undermining the political foundation for our bilateral relations while stressing the need to put 'guardrails' on the relationship," Mr. Wang added.
The Biden administration says it wants to establish "guardrails" to prevent an incident from flaring over a misunderstanding in heavily contested areas such as the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait, where China conducted live-fire drills in response to Ms. Tsai's visit. Without protocols and direct lines of communication, the risk for an incident will remain high as U.S. and Chinese forces patrol the region regularly, and often at close range.
Beijing views guardrails as another form of containment because they would disclose to the United States how far it can be pressured without triggering a military response. China would prefer its red lines to remain ambiguous and leave Washington guessing.
China suspended most military dialogue with the United States last August following former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. The Pentagon said as recently as last week that Beijing had declined requests for engagement with Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark A. Milley.
Mr. Blinken expressed some optimism that high-level talks would resume.
"My expectation would be that we will be able to move forward on that. But it does require China to make clear its own intentions in doing that," he said on Tuesday speaking to reporters at a meeting of the Group of 7 nations in Japan.
Analysts say Mr. Xi likely believes he has nothing to gain from speaking to President Biden at this moment, particularly as negative views on China in the United States appear increasingly entrenched.
"Xi clearly believes that engagement for engagement's sake is a fool's errand. The time for talk has passed. Instead, it's time for Beijing to batten down the hatches," said Craig Singleton, a senior China fellow at the nonpartisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies. "Simply put, there is no going back to the way things were, so Xi must now prepare China for a more fraught future."
Minxin Pei, a professor at Claremont McKenna College who studies Chinese politics, said it is possible that Beijing will re-engage with Washington once it feels it has more leverage. That could come after Beijing has deepened ties with more nonaligned countries like Brazil or after it has widened splits in Europe over how closely to follow the United States in its tougher stance toward China.
"China wants to engage the U.S. from a position of strength, and China is clearly not in that position now," Mr. Pei said. "If anything, America's success in rallying allies and waging the tech war against China proves that it is still far more powerful than China and has more tools at its disposal."
China is now trying to tread a fine line between snubbing the United States diplomatically and trying to persuade central bankers and investors that it is open for business again after years of stringent Covid measures.
Yi Gang, China's central bank governor, met with Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, on the sidelines of a World Bank and International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington last week to discuss their countries' economies. Plans are also in the works for Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo to visit China.
But Mr. Yi had grievances, too. He criticized Western countries for diverting trade away from China toward geopolitical allies instead, using the term "friend-shoring" in a statement to the International Monetary and Financial Committee on Friday.
Chinese analysts say the prospects of Sino-U.S. relations improving anytime soon remain remote. The modest progress Mr. Xi and Mr. Biden achieved after meeting in Indonesia last November is all but gone following the balloon incident and Ms. Tsai's visit to the United States, said Wu Xinbo, dean of international studies at Fudan University in Shanghai.
"In China's view, though Biden showed a good attitude in Bali, he is not strongly willing to improve Sino-U.S. relations," Mr. Wu said. "China thinks the U.S. has neither the sincerity nor the ability to improve relations."

China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, rolled out the red carpet for President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil, lauding him as “an old friend of the Chinese people.” He sipped tea in a garden with President Emmanuel Macron of France, treating him to a performance of an ancient Chinese zither. And he talked on the phone with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, offering well wishes for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
But even as Xi has offered a glad hand to those and other world leaders in recent weeks, it has been only the cold shoulder for the United States. China has rebuffed attempts by the Biden administration to restart high-level talks and lower tensions over Taiwan. And Xi’s government has intensified a campaign of ridicule and criticism of the United States and Western democracy.
Taken together, the efforts to shore up ties with American allies while publicly discrediting the United States reflect Beijing’s hardening position as relations sink to their lowest point in decades over what Xi has described as Washington’s “containment, encirclement and suppression of China.”
The two-pronged approach, some analysts say, is compelling evidence that Xi has fully committed to the view that engagement between China and the United States is fruitless, at least for now. And it has lent urgency to concerns that the two powers are on a collision course that could lead to dangerous accidents, or even war, over Taiwan and other geopolitical flash points.
Xi’s diplomatic effort was rebuffed by the United States and some of its closest allies this week, when a meeting of top diplomats from the Group of 7 major industrialized nations gathered in Japan and vowed to address China’s growing assertiveness together. But Xi has still been getting some of the reaction he and other Chinese officials had hoped for in recent months, visually chipping at some of the alliances that underpin Washington’s influence.
During Xi’s meeting with Lula, the Brazilian leader railed against the continued dominance of the U.S. dollar in trade and paid a visit to a research center for China’s telecommunications giant, Huawei, which is under sanctions from the United States. Macron hailed European autonomy and warned against being dragged by the United States into a war over Taiwan. And Crown Prince Mohammed praised China’s growing “constructive role” in the Middle East, a not so subtle dig at the United States and its strained relationships in the region.
At the same time, Chinese state media has railed against the “perils” and “abuse” of American hegemony and criticized the United States on human rights, racism and gun violence. It has seized on the leaked Pentagon documents to highlight how Washington has been spying on its allies. And it has mocked the Biden administration for holding a summit on democracy last month, describing U.S. democracy as “troubled,” “messy” and “in constant decline.”
Beijing’s harsher line reflects its frustrations over a series of U.S. moves, particularly in relation to Taiwan, the self-governing island claimed by China. Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, visited the United States this month and met with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. On Monday, Taiwan said it had clinched a deal to buy up to 400 U.S. anti-ship missiles to help counter a potential Chinese invasion.
Then there are the joint military drills the United States is conducting with the Philippines, the largest in decades.
Those moves compound deeper resentments that center on U.S. restrictions of advanced semiconductor exports to China and growing security ties between the United States and countries on China’s periphery such as Japan, South Korea, Australia and India.
To Chinese officials, U.S. pleas for renewed diplomatic engagement — including a long-awaited call between President Joe Biden and Xi — ring hollow in the face of what they view as rising hostility and provocations. High-level talks can only proceed after the United States has demonstrated “credible sincerity with concrete actions,” Chinese state media said last week.
“The responsibility for the current difficulties in China-U.S. relations does not lie with China,” Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said recently when asked about resuming dialogue with Washington and the potential rescheduling of a visit to Beijing by Secretary of State Antony Blinken that was called off after the emergence of a suspected high altitude Chinese spy balloon over the continental United States in February.
“The U.S. needs to stop interfering in China’s internal affairs and harming China’s interests, and stop undermining the political foundation for our bilateral relations while stressing the need to put ‘guardrails’ on the relationship,” Wang added.
The Biden administration says it wants to establish “guardrails” to prevent an incident from flaring over a misunderstanding in heavily contested areas such as the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait, where China conducted live-fire drills in response to Tsai’s visit. Without protocols and direct lines of communication, the risk for an incident will remain high as U.S. and Chinese forces patrol the region regularly, and often at close range.
Beijing views guardrails as another form of containment because they would disclose to the United States how far it can be pressured without triggering a military response. China would prefer its red lines to remain ambiguous and leave Washington guessing.
China suspended most military dialogue with the United States last August following former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan. The Pentagon said as recently as last week that Beijing had declined requests for engagement with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley.
Blinken expressed some optimism that high-level talks would resume.
“My expectation would be that we will be able to move forward on that. But it does require China to make clear its own intentions in doing that,” he told reporters Tuesday at a meeting of the G-7 nations in Japan.
Analysts say Xi likely believes he has nothing to gain from speaking to Biden at this moment, particularly as negative views on China in the United States appear increasingly entrenched.
“Xi clearly believes that engagement for engagement’s sake is a fool’s errand. The time for talk has passed. Instead, it’s time for Beijing to batten down the hatches,” said Craig Singleton, a senior China fellow at the nonpartisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “Simply put, there is no going back to the way things were, so Xi must now prepare China for a more fraught future.”
Minxin Pei, a professor at Claremont McKenna College who studies Chinese politics, said it is possible that Beijing will reengage with Washington once it feels it has more leverage. That could come after Beijing has deepened ties with more nonaligned countries like Brazil or after it has widened splits in Europe over how closely to follow the United States in its tougher stance toward China.
“China wants to engage the U.S. from a position of strength, and China is clearly not in that position now,” Pei said. “If anything, America’s success in rallying allies and waging the tech war against China proves that it is still far more powerful than China and has more tools at its disposal.”
China is trying to tread a fine line between snubbing the United States diplomatically and trying to persuade central bankers and investors that it is open for business again after years of stringent COVID measures.
Yi Gang, China’s central bank governor, met with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on the sidelines of a World Bank and International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington last week to discuss their countries’ economies. Plans are also in the works for Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo to visit China.
But Yi had grievances, too. He criticized Western countries from diverting trade away from China toward geopolitical allies instead, using the term “friend-shoring” in a statement to the International Monetary and Financial Committee on Friday.
Chinese analysts say the prospects of Sino-U.S. relations improving anytime soon remains remote. The modest progress Xi and Biden achieved after meeting in Indonesia in November is all but gone following the balloon incident and Tsai’s visit to the United States, said Wu Xinbo, dean of international studies at Fudan University in Shanghai.
“In China’s view, though Biden showed a good attitude in Bali, he is not strongly willing to improve Sino-U.S. relations,” Wu said. “China thinks the U.S. has neither the sincerity nor the ability to improve relations.”

What Are America and China Fighting About?: [Op-Ed]

Full text: TAIPEI, Taiwan -- I just returned from visiting China for the first time since Covid struck. Being back in Beijing was a reminder of my first rule of journalism: If you don't go, you don't know. Relations between our two countries have soured so badly, so quickly, and have so reduced our points of contact -- very few American reporters are left in China, and our leaders are barely talking -- that we're now like two giant gorillas looking at each other through a pinhole. Nothing good will come from this.
The recent visit by Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-wen, to the United States -- which prompted Beijing to hold live-fire drills off Taiwan's coast and to warn anew that peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are incompatible with any move by Taiwan toward formal independence -- was just the latest reminder of how overheated this atmosphere is. The smallest misstep by either side could ignite a U.S.-China war that would make Ukraine look like a neighborhood dust-up.
That's one of the many reasons I found it helpful to be back in Beijing and to be able to observe China again through a larger aperture than a pinhole. Attending the China Development Forum -- Beijing's very useful annual gathering of local and global business leaders, senior Chinese officials, retired diplomats and a few local and Western journalists -- reminded me of some powerful old truths and exposed me to some eye-popping new realities about what's really eating away at U.S.-China relations.
Hint: The new, new thing has a lot to do with the increasingly important role that trust, and its absence, plays in international relations, now that so many goods and services that the United States and China sell to one another are digital, and therefore dual use -- meaning they can be both a weapon and a tool. Just when trust has become more important than ever between the U.S. and China, it also has become scarcer than ever. Bad trend.
More personally, being back in Beijing was also a reminder of how many people I've come to know and like there over three decades of reporting visits -- but please don't tell anyone in Washington that I said that. There's something of a competition today between Democrats and Republicans over who can speak most harshly about China. Truth be told, both countries have so demonized the other of late that it is easy to forget how much we have in common as people. I can't think of any major nation after the United States with more of a Protestant work ethic and naturally capitalist population than China.
Being back was also a reminder of the formidable weight and strength of what China has built since opening to the world in the 1970s, and even since Covid hit in 2019. China's Communist Party government has a stronger grip than ever on its society, thanks to its police state surveillance and digital tracking systems: Facial recognition cameras are everywhere. The party crushes any challenge to its rule or to President Xi Jinping. These days, it is extremely difficult for a visiting columnist to get anyone -- a senior official or a Starbucks barista -- to speak on the record. It was not that way a decade ago.
That said, one should have no illusions: The Communist Party's hold is also a product of all the hard work and savings of the Chinese people, which have enabled the party and the state to build world-class infrastructure and public goods that make life for China's middle and lower classes steadily better.
Beijing and Shanghai, in particular, have become very livable cities, with the air pollution largely erased and lots of new, walkable green spaces. As my Times colleague Keith Bradsher reported in 2021, Shanghai had recently built 55 new parks, bringing its total to 406, and had plans for nearly 600 more.
Bradsher, one of the handful of American reporters who lived in mainland China through nearly three years of stringent "zero Covid" policies, also pointed out to me that some 900 cities and towns in China are now served by high-speed rail, which makes travel to even remote communities incredibly cheap, easy and comfortable. In the last 23 years America has built exactly one sort-of-high-speed rail line, the Acela, serving 15 stops between Washington, D.C., and Boston. Think about that: 900 to 15.
I say this not to argue that high-speed trains are better than freedom. I say this to explain that being in Beijing reminds you that China's stability is a product of both an increasingly pervasive police state and a government that has steadily raised standards of living. It's a regime that takes both absolute control and relentless nation-building seriously.
For an American to fly from New York's Kennedy Airport into Beijing Capital International Airport today is to fly from an overcrowded bus terminal to a Disney-like Tomorrowland. It makes me weep for all the time we have wasted these past eight years talking about a faux nation builder named Donald Trump.
On my first day in Beijing, I had a conversation with a young Chinese woman, a college student. Her first question, alluding to a book I wrote, was: "Mr. Friedman, is the world still flat?"
I explained why I thought it was flatter than ever by my definition -- that because of steady advances in connectivity and digitization, more people can compete, connect and collaborate on more things for less money from more places than ever. During my time in Beijing, I was struck at how educated Chinese people seem to be more connected, and able to get around digital firewalls, than before.
I could see the woman wasn't totally convinced by my explanation, so we moved on to other subjects. And then she dropped this: "I just used ChatGPT."
I said, "You used ChatGPT from Beijing, and you're asking me if the world is still flat?"
Indeed, a story making the rounds in Beijing is that many Chinese have begun using ChatGPT to do their ideology homework for the local Communist Party cell, so they don't have to waste time on it.
It's funny, though -- just when you start to worry about the state of J.F.K. Airport, and all the stories in recent years that China was going to bury us in the race to A.I., an American team, OpenAI, comes up with the world's leading natural language processing tool, which enables any user to have humanlike conversations, ask any question and get deep insights in every major language, including Mandarin.
China got an early jump on A.I. in two realms -- facial recognition technology and health records -- because there are virtually no privacy restrictions on the government's ability to build huge data sets for machine learning algorithms to find patterns.
But generative A.I., like ChatGPT, gives anyone, from a poor farmer to a college professor, the power to ask any question on any subject in his or her own language. This could be a real problem for China, because it will have to build many guardrails into its own generative A.I. systems to limit what Chinese citizens can ask and what the computer can answer. If you can't ask whatever you want, including what happened in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, and if your A.I. system is always trying to figure out what to censor, where to censor and whom to censor, it will be less productive.
"ChatGPT is prompting some people to ask if the U.S. is rising again, like in the 1990s," Dingding Chen, a Chinese political scientist, told me and Bradsher.
It's for all of these reasons that weighing the shifting power relationship between America and China has become such a popular pastime among elites in both of our countries. For instance, through social media, many Chinese got to see parts of the March 23rd hearing on Capitol Hill where members of Congress questioned -- or, actually, berated, harangued and constantly interrupted -- TikTok's chief executive, Shou Chew, claiming TikTok's videos were damaging American children's mental health.
Hu Xijin, one of China's most popular bloggers, with almost 25 million followers on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, explained to me just how insulting Chinese found that hearing. It was widely and derisively commented about online in China.
(All that said, YouTube has been banned from China since 2009, so we're not the only ones frightened by popular apps. I say we trade: We'll accept TikTok if Beijing will let in YouTube.)
"I understand your feeling: You have been in the first place for a century, and now China is rising, and we have the potential to become the first -- and that is not easy for you," Hu said to me. But "you should not try to stop China's development. You can't contain China in the end. We are quite smart. And very diligent. We work very hard. And we have 1.4 billion people."
Before the Trump presidency, he added: "We never thought China-U.S. relations would ever become so bad. Now we gradually accept the situation, and most Chinese people think there is no hope for better relations. We think the relationship will be worse and worse and hope that war will not break out between our two countries."
It was repeated conversations like these that got me started asking American, Chinese and Taiwanese investors, analysts and officials a question that has been nagging at me for a while: What exactly are America and China fighting about?
A lot of people hesitated when I asked. Indeed, many would answer with some version of "I'm not sure, I just know that it's THEIR fault."
I'm pretty sure I'd get the same answer in Washington.
The best part of this trip was uncovering the real answer to that question and why it stumps so many people. It's because the real answer is so much deeper and more complex than just the usual one-word response -- "Taiwan" -- or the usual three-word response -- "autocracy versus democracy."
Let me try to peel back the layers. The erosion in U.S.-China relations is a result of something old and obvious -- a traditional great-power rivalry between an incumbent power (us) and a rising power (China) -- but with lots of new twists that are not always visible to the naked eye.
The old and obvious aspect is that China and America are jostling to acquire the most economic and military clout to shape the rules of the 21st century in ways most advantageous to their respective economic and political systems. And one of those disputed rules, which America has acknowledged but not endorsed, is China's claim to Taiwan as part of "One China."
Because that "rule" remains in dispute, we will continue to arm Taiwan to deter Beijing from seizing the island, crushing its democracy and using it as a jumping off point to dominate the rest of East Asia, and China will keep pushing for reunification -- one way or another.
One of the twists, though, is that this standard-issue great-power rivalry is occurring between nations that have become as economically intertwined as the strands of a DNA molecule. As a result, neither China nor America has ever had a rival quite like the other.
America knew how to deal with Nazi Germany, an economic and military peer, but a country with which we were not deeply economically intertwined. America knew how to deal with the Soviet Union, a military peer but nowhere near our economic peer, and a country with which we were not economically intertwined at all.
Ditto China. For several thousand years China saw itself as situated in the middle of the world -- hence it referred to itself as Zhong Guo, the Middle Kingdom -- protected by mountains, deserts and seas on all sides, and often dominating states around it, while fiercely preserving its own culture. That was until the 19th century, when it began to be repeatedly ravaged by stronger foreign powers: Britain, France, Russia and Japan.
But in modern times, China, like America, has never had to deal with a true economic and military peer with which it was also totally intertwined through trade and investment.
How intertwined? Americans' favorite device is an iPhone assembled mostly in China, and until recently the favored foreign destination of Chinese college students -- some 300,000 of them today -- is America. That makes for some weird scenes, like watching one country shoot down another country's intelligence balloon just after the two countries in 2022 set a record in annual bilateral trade.
Another new twist, and a reason it's hard to define exactly what we're fighting about, has a lot to do with how this elusive issue of trust and the absence of it have suddenly assumed much greater importance in international affairs.
This is a byproduct of our new technological ecosystem in which more and more devices and services that we both use and trade are driven by microchips and software, and connected through data centers in the cloud and high-speed internet. When so many more products or services became digitized and connected, so many more things became "dual use." That is, technologies that can easily be converted from civilian tools to military weapons, or vice versa.
In the Cold War it was relatively easy to say that this fighter jet is a weapon and that that phone is a tool. But when we install the ability to sense, digitize, connect, process, learn, share and act into more and more things -- from your GPS-enabled phone to your car to your toaster to your favorite app -- they all become dual use, either weapons or tools depending on who controls the software running them and who owns the data that they spin off.
Today, it's just a few lines of code that separate autonomous cars from autonomous weapons. And, as we've seen in Ukraine, a smartphone can be used by Grandma to call the grandkids or to call a Ukrainian rocket-launching unit and give it the GPS coordinates of a Russian tank in her backyard.
This, too, leads to more weird twists. I am thinking of how a number of U.S. armed forces branches have banned TikTok from government-issued smartphones and computers. This is surely the first time that the Pentagon has banned an app that is known mostly for sharing dance moves. But there is a real fear that TikTok's highly addictive algorithm is dual use and could be repurposed by the Chinese intelligence service to amass data on our youth -- more than 150 million Americans have downloaded the app, the company says -- to scramble their brains, spread disinformation or collect information that could one day be used for blackmail.
And the twists just keep on coming. For the first 30 or so years after Beijing opened up to trading with the world, starting around 1978-79, China largely sold America what I call "shallow" goods -- shoes, socks, shirts and solar panels.
Meanwhile, America and the West tended to sell China what I call "deep goods" -- goods that went deep into their systems and were dual use -- namely software, microchips, bandwidth, smartphones and robots. China had to buy our deep goods because, until relatively recently, it could not make many itself.
As long as most of what China sold us was shallow goods, we did not care as much about its political system -- doubly so because it seemed for a while as if China was slowly but steadily becoming more and more integrated with the world and slightly more open and transparent every year. So, it was both easy and convenient to set aside some of our worries about the dark sides of its political system.
But then, about eight years ago, we got a knock on our door and there was a Chinese salesman. He said: "Hi, my name is Mr. Huawei and I make 5G telephone equipment better than anything you have. I'm starting to install it all over the world, and I'd like to wire America."
What America essentially told this Huawei salesman, as well as other rising Chinese high-tech firms, was this: "When Chinese companies were just selling us shallow goods, we didn't care if your political system was authoritarian, libertarian or vegetarian; we were just buying your shallow goods. But when you want to sell us 'deep goods' -- goods that are dual use and will go deep into our homes, bedrooms, industries, chatbots and urban infrastructure -- we don't have enough trust to buy them. So, we are going to ban Huawei and instead pay more to buy our 5G telecom systems from Scandinavian companies we do trust: Ericsson and Nokia."
The role of trust in international relations and commerce took one more great leap for another reason: As more and more products and services became digitized and electrified, the microchips that powered everything became the new oil. What crude oil was to powering 19th- and 20th-century economies, microchips are for powering 21st-century economies.
So today, the country or countries that can make the fastest, most powerful and most energy efficient microchips can make the biggest A.I. computers and dominate in economics and military affairs.
But here's the rub: Because the physics of making advanced logic chips has become so complex -- a human hair is about 90,000 nanometers thick and the world's best mass producer of advanced chips in the world is now making three-nanometer transistors -- no one country or company can own the whole supply chain. You need the best from everywhere, and that supply chain is so tightly intertwined that each company has to trust the others intimately.
China doesn't need to look far for that lesson. It is on display right across the Straits of Taiwan, at the world's greatest chip-making company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, better known as TSMC.
After I left Beijing, I came to Taiwan, where I spent an afternoon with the leaders of TSMC at their headquarters in Hsinchu Science Park, a 90-minute drive south of Taipei, the capital. When you ask them what is the secret that enables TSMC to make 90 percent of the world's most advanced logic chips -- while China, which speaks the same language and shares the same recent cultural history, makes zero -- their answer is simple: "trust."
TSMC is a semiconductor foundry, meaning it takes the designs of the most advanced computer companies in the world -- Apple, Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD and others -- and turns the designs into chips that perform different processing functions. In doing so, TSMC makes two solemn oaths to its customers: TSMC will never compete against them by designing its own chips and it will never share the designs of one of its customers with another.
"Our business is to serve multiple competitive clients," Kevin Zhang, senior vice president for business development at TSMC, explained to me. "We are committed not to compete with any of them, and internally our people who serve customer A will never leak their information to customer C."
But by working with so many trusted partners, TSMC leverages the partners' steadily more complex designs to make itself better -- and the better it gets, the more advanced designs it can master for its customers. This not only requires incredibly tight collaboration between TSMC and its customers, but also between TSMC and its roughly 1,000 critical local and global suppliers.
"Our customers are very demanding," added Zhang. "Their products each have unique requirements." They each "tell us what they want to do, and together we figure out how TSMC will design the process to make it." As the physics of chip making gets more and more extreme, "the investment from customers is getting bigger and bigger, so they have to work with us more closely to make sure they harvest as much [computing power] as they can. They have to trust you."
China also has a foundry, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, which is partly state-owned. But guess what? Because no global chip designers trust SMIC with their most advanced designs, it is at least a decade behind TSMC.
It's for these reasons that the erosion in U.S.-China relations goes beyond our increasingly sharp disagreements over Taiwan. It is rooted in the fact that just when trust, and its absence, became much bigger factors in international affairs and commerce, China changed its trajectory. It made itself a less trusted partner right when the most important technology for the 21st century -- semiconductors -- required unprecedented degrees of trust to manufacture and more and more devices and services became deep and dual use.
Why did China lose our trust?
After the period of China's isolation and internal turmoil under Mao Zedong ended with his death in 1976, a successor, Deng Xiaoping, made a 180-degree turn away from Maoism. Deng established a much more collective leadership for China and term limits for the top leaders, and he put pragmatism -- whatever would drive economic growth -- above Communist ideology, while hiding China's growing strength.
In the era of Deng and his successors -- in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s -- Beijing forged strong economic and educational ties with the United States, which ushered China into the World Trade Organization, on the condition that China gradually phase out its mercantilist practice of funding state-owned industries and that it gradually open itself to more foreign investment and ownership, much as the world opened itself to China's exports.
But after Xi Jinping took over as China's paramount leader in 2012, he seemed to be alarmed at how China's openness toward the world, its consensus approach to leadership and its rush down a semi-capitalist path had led to runaway corruption inside both the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, to a degree that was hurting the party's legitimacy.
So Xi centralized power into his own hands, crushed all the fiefs that had been created by different leaders of different government agencies and sectors of the economy, re-injected the authority of the Communist Party into every corner of business, academia and society and deployed pervasive surveillance technologies. All together, this reversed what seemed like China's steady march toward more openness -- and even a somewhat freer press.
Xi also basically shifted away from Deng's unabashed unleashing of the private sector, focusing instead on building national economic champions that could dominate all the key industries of the 21st century -- from A.I. to quantum computing to aerospace -- and making sure Communist Party cells were in their management and in their work forces. And when American trade officials said: "Hey, you need to live up to your W.T.O. commitments to restrict state-funding of industries," China basically said: "Why should we live by your interpretation of the rules? We are now big enough to make our own interpretations. We're too big; you're too late."
Combined with China's failure to come clean on what it knew about the origins of Covid-19, its crackdown on democratic freedoms in Hong Kong and on the Uyghur Muslim minority in Xinjiang, its aggressive moves to lay claim to the South China Sea, its increasing saber rattling toward Taiwan, its cozying up to Vladimir Putin (despite his savaging of Ukraine), Xi's moves toward making himself president for life, his kneecapping of China's own tech entrepreneurs, his tighter restrictions on speech and the occasional abduction of a leading Chinese businessman -- all of these added up to one very big thing: Whatever trust that China had built up with the West since the late 1970s evaporated at the exact moment in history when trust, and shared values, became more important than ever in a world of deep, dual-use products driven by software, connectivity and microchips.
As that happened, it started to matter a lot more to Western nations generally and the United States in particular that this rising power -- which we were now selling to or buying from all sorts of dual-use digital devices or apps -- was authoritarian.
Beijing, for its part, argues that as China became a stronger global competitor to America -- in deep goods like Huawei 5G -- the United States simply could not handle it and decided to use its control over advanced semiconductor manufacturing and other high-tech exports from America, as well as from our allies, to ensure China always remained in our rearview mirror. So Beijing came up with a new strategy, called "dual circulation." It said: We will use state-led investments to make everything we possibly can at home, to become independent of the world. And we will use our manufacturing prowess to make the world dependent on our exports.
Chinese officials also argue that a lot of American politicians -- led by Trump but echoed by many in Congress -- suddenly seemed to find it very convenient to put the blame for economic troubles in the U.S.'s middle class not on any educational deficiencies, or a poor work ethic, or automation or the 2008 looting by financial elites, and the crisis that followed, but on China's exports to the United States. As Beijing sees it, China not only became America's go-to boogeyman, but in their frenzy to blame Beijing for everything, members of Congress started to more recklessly promote Taiwan's independence.
A senior administration official told me that Xi told President Biden at their summit in Bali in November, in essence: I will not be the president of China who loses Taiwan. If you force my hand, there will be war. You don't understand how important this is to the Chinese people. You're playing with fire.
Nevertheless, it's clear to me that at some level Chinese officials now understand that, as a result of their own aggressive actions in recent years on all the fronts I've listed, they have frightened both the world and their own innovators at precisely the wrong time.
I say that because of how often senior Chinese officials tell every foreign leader and visiting Western business executive they meet today that China is "open" and eager for foreign investment. The reality is, it has to be more open to foreign direct investment because China's provinces desperately need capital to compensate for all the money each local government spent controlling Covid and because many of them are running out of land to sell for state-owned factories to raise money.
I also don't think it was an accident of timing that Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba and sort of the Steve Jobs of China, suddenly reappeared a few weeks ago in state-controlled media after having suddenly disappeared from public view in 2020. Ma had vanished after a disagreement with state regulators, who thought he was getting too big and independent. His disappearance sent shock waves through China's start-up community and curbed investments.
I have no problem saying that I would like to live in a world where the Chinese people are thriving, alongside all others. After all, we are talking about more than one out of six people on the planet. I don't buy the argument that we are destined for war. I believe that we are doomed to compete with each other, doomed to cooperate with each other and doomed to find some way to balance the two. Otherwise we are both going to have a very bad 21st century.
I have to say, though, Americans and Chinese remind me of Israelis and Palestinians in one respect: They are both expert at aggravating the other's deepest insecurities.
China's Communist Party is now convinced that America wants to bring it down, which some U.S. politicians are actually no longer shy about suggesting. So, Beijing is ready to crawl into bed with Putin, a war criminal, if that is what it takes to keep the Americans at bay.
Americans are now worried that Communist China, which got rich by taking advantage of a global market shaped by American rules, will use its newfound market power to unilaterally change those rules entirely to its advantage. So we've decided to focus our waning strength vis-à-vis Beijing on ensuring the Chinese will always be a decade behind us on microchips.
I don't know what is sufficient to reverse these trends, but I think I know what is necessary.
If it is not the goal of U.S. foreign policy to topple the Communist regime in China, the United States needs to make that crystal clear, because I found a lot more people than ever before in Beijing think otherwise.
And by the way, in today's fused world, the notion that China can economically collapse and America still thrive is utter fantasy. And the notion that the Europeans will always be with us in such an endeavor, given the size of China's market, may also be fanciful. Note French President Emmanuel Macron's bowing and scraping in Beijing last week.
As for China, it can tell itself all it wants that it has not taken a U-turn in recent years. But no one is buying it. China will never realize its full potential -- in a hyper-connected, digitized, deep, dual-use, semiconductor-powered world -- unless it understands that establishing and maintaining trust is now the single most important competitive advantage any country or company can have. And Beijing is failing in that endeavor.
In his splendid biography of the great American statesman George Shultz, Philip Taubman quotes one of Shultz's cardinal rules of diplomacy and life: "Trust is the coin of the realm."
Never has that been truer than today, and never has China been more in need of embracing that truth.

TOKYO — Hideji Suzuki served six years in a Chinese prison on spying charges — a sentence that stemmed, he said, from a dinner party where he did nothing more than try to make small talk with a Chinese academic about North Korea.
Since returning to Japan in October, he has tried to raise the alarm about China’s seemingly arbitrary detentions of Japanese citizens. He is one of 17 Japanese nationals detained on similar charges since 2015, but the only one to speak out about his experience and what he describes as Japan’s weak efforts to help him. His goal, he said, is to shame the Japanese government into taking stronger action to aid others who find themselves at Beijing’s mercy.
Now, with the arrest last month in China of a Japanese pharmaceutical executive on espionage charges, Beijing has tested Japan’s resolve once again.
China is Japan’s largest export market, and Japanese politicians and companies alike have been reluctant to speak out about similar cases. But the new arrest has sent shock waves through the Japanese business community in China and garnered an unusually strong reaction from Tokyo, which has demanded the executive’s release. Japan’s foreign minister reportedly raised the issue on a trip to Beijing earlier this month.
The heightened reaction comes as Japan seeks to reduce its reliance on China, amid growing concern about Beijing’s rising assertiveness and dominant position in key supply chains. Japanese policymakers have taken a range of measures aimed at hedging against China, from increasing military spending to more closely coordinating industrial policies with the United States and other allies.
Still, even with the more vocal response, Japan’s actions in the latest case have been far more subdued than those of other nations facing similar situations. So far, Japan has not mustered anything approaching the outrage shown by Canada when China arrested two Canadians in 2018 on espionage charges in apparent retaliation for the arrest of a top executive at Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei.
To Suzuki, Japan is falling short yet again. “It’s better than it was for me, but I think the outcome won’t change much,” he said in a recent interview in Tokyo.
While it is difficult to quantify China’s imprisonment of foreigners, Beijing seems to have detained an unusually high number of Japanese citizens on spying charges. In the case of Suzuki, the former president of a Japan-China friendship organization, his arrest came during a 2016 trip to China, one of more than 200 visits he had made to the country since first traveling there in 1983.
On these visits, he became close friends with many Chinese academics and top officials, even meeting Li Keqiang, a former premier, twice, he said. He went on to teach university courses about China and translate books about the normalization of ties between Japan and China after World War II.
But as China’s wariness of foreigners grew, those relationships and credentials made him an object of suspicion, he said. He believes he was targeted as part of the Chinese government’s growing efforts to control academic studies of China, a push that has also led to the arrests of nearly 20 Chinese professors returning from work at Japanese universities.
Suzuki was preparing to fly home from Beijing when men in plainclothes threw him into a van, he said. He was held in informal detention and interrogated for seven months. During that time, the lights in his room were never turned off, even when he was sleeping, and his jailers let him see the sun only once, for just 15 minutes, he said.
When Suzuki was finally put on trial, the proceedings were closed and took just two days: one to read the charges and another to render his sentence. He was granted one appeal, which was rejected.
Suzuki insists that he is innocent. At the dinner party where he tried to discuss North Korea, he said, he simply asked how the country was doing. The Chinese academic’s response was noncommittal.
Conditions in Chinese prisons are harsh. Some Japanese detainees have lost teeth because of a lack of dental care. One died of unknown causes while incarcerated, according to the Japanese Foreign Ministry.
Japanese consular officers came to visit Suzuki once a month. But they offered little support, he said. When he asked one of the diplomats to make his case public, he said, he got a scolding: “They asked me, ‘Do you want to be any more famous than you already are?’”
When he finally returned home in October, he found that hardly anyone had heard about his detention, he said.
Nobuyuki Fukushima, a member of the lower house of Japan’s parliament, said the Japanese Foreign Ministry had ignored his requests for updates about Suzuki’s case.
In response to questions from The New York Times about Suzuki’s detention, the ministry said that it could not discuss details of individual cases, but that, in general, it offered “as much support as possible” to detained Japanese citizens.
Japanese analysts attribute the surge in arrests to China’s introduction in 2014 and 2015 of new national security laws that targeted those deemed foreign spies and their local collaborators and expanded the scope of possible espionage claims.
The charges in spying cases vary but often appear to be arbitrary. Chinese law takes a broad view of what constitutes a state secret, including information that would be considered innocuous in other countries, said Bonji Ohara, a senior fellow at Sasakawa Peace Foundation and a former Japanese naval attache in China.
“What’s illegal is not clearly defined, so it’s difficult for people who are active there to assess what they need to avoid,” he said.
Five of the 17 Japanese citizens detained on charges of violating state secrets laws, including the pharmaceutical executive, are jailed. A few weeks ago, another Japanese citizen received a 12-year sentence for spying, Japan’s Foreign Ministry reported.
But detentions of Japanese nationals go much further back. In 2010, China arrested four Japanese citizens who were accused of taking videos of military installations. Their detention came after Japan had taken into custody a Chinese ship captain whose trawler crashed into Japanese coast guard vessels near islands disputed by the two countries.
Shin Kawashima, a University of Tokyo professor, said that he stopped traveling to China for research in 2019, after the arrest of Nobu Iwatani, a professor of Chinese history. Iwatani spent about two months in detention before finally confessing to violating China’s espionage law, an admission that appears to have been made under duress.
Beijing has long viewed Japan as an enemy, and “it’s so easy for them to imagine Japanese spies are everywhere,” Kawashima said.
That’s especially true for those who speak the language and have deep networks in the country, he said. “The better you know China, the more suspicious they become of you,” he said.
China blamed the Japanese government for the arrests. Speaking at a regular news briefing late last month, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, confirmed the latest detention and chided Tokyo for the significant number of Japanese arrested on spying charges in recent years.
“The Japanese side needs to do more to ask their citizens not to engage in such activities,” she said.
With Japan’s prosperity dependent on its access to China’s huge markets, the country is “the easiest to push around,” said Ichiro Korogi, a professor at Kanda University of International Studies who is an expert on Chinese politics.
That may be changing now as Japan takes a harder line on China. That, in part, is a response to Beijing’s crackdown on Hong Kong and its draconian handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also sharpened concern in Japan that China could take similar action against Taiwan, destabilizing the region.
Suzuki hopes China will recognize that its treatment of Japanese citizens is working against both countries’ interests.
In the meantime, Japan needs to “take a stand and create a strong system for crisis management,” he said. “Otherwise, the next time someone is detained, there won’t be any chance of saving them.”

TOKYO — Hideji Suzuki served six years in a Chinese prison on spying charges — a sentence that stemmed, he said, from a dinner party where he did nothing more than try to make small talk with a Chinese academic about North Korea.
Since returning to Japan in October, he has tried to raise the alarm about China’s seemingly arbitrary detentions of Japanese citizens. He is one of 17 Japanese nationals detained on similar charges since 2015, but the only one to speak out about his experience and what he describes as Japan’s weak efforts to help him. His goal, he said, is to shame the Japanese government into taking stronger action to aid others who find themselves at Beijing’s mercy.
Now, with the arrest last month in China of a Japanese pharmaceutical executive on espionage charges, Beijing has tested Japan’s resolve once again.
China is Japan’s largest export market, and Japanese politicians and companies alike have been reluctant to speak out about similar cases. But the new arrest has sent shock waves through the Japanese business community in China and garnered an unusually strong reaction from Tokyo, which has demanded the executive’s release. Japan’s foreign minister reportedly raised the issue on a trip to Beijing earlier this month.
The heightened reaction comes as Japan seeks to reduce its reliance on China, amid growing concern about Beijing’s rising assertiveness and dominant position in key supply chains. Japanese policymakers have taken a range of measures aimed at hedging against China, from increasing military spending to more closely coordinating industrial policies with the United States and other allies.
Still, even with the more vocal response, Japan’s actions in the latest case have been far more subdued than those of other nations facing similar situations. So far, Japan has not mustered anything approaching the outrage shown by Canada when China arrested two Canadians in 2018 on espionage charges in apparent retaliation for the arrest of a top executive at Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei.
To Suzuki, Japan is falling short yet again. “It’s better than it was for me, but I think the outcome won’t change much,” he said in a recent interview in Tokyo.
While it is difficult to quantify China’s imprisonment of foreigners, Beijing seems to have detained an unusually high number of Japanese citizens on spying charges. In the case of Suzuki, his arrest came during a 2016 business trip to China, one of hundreds of visits he had made to the country since first traveling there in 1983.
On these visits, he became close friends with many Chinese academics and top officials, even meeting Li Keqiang, a former premier, twice, he said. He went on to head the Japan-China Youth Exchange Association, teach university courses about China and translate books about the normalization of ties between Japan and China after World War II.
But as China’s wariness of foreigners grew, those relationships and credentials made him an object of suspicion, he said. He believes he was targeted as part of the Chinese government’s growing efforts to control academic studies of China, a push that has also led to the arrests of nearly 20 Chinese professors returning from work at Japanese universities.
Suzuki was preparing to fly home from Beijing when men in plainclothes threw him into a van, he said. He was held in informal detention and interrogated for seven months. During that time, the lights in his room were never turned off, even when he was sleeping, and his jailers let him see the sun only once, for just 15 minutes, he said.
When Suzuki was finally put on trial, the proceedings were closed and took just two days: one to read the charges and another to render his sentence. He was granted one appeal, which was rejected.
Suzuki insists that he is innocent. At the dinner party where he tried to discuss North Korea, he said, he simply asked how the country was doing. The Chinese academic’s response was noncommittal.
Conditions in Chinese prisons are harsh. Some Japanese detainees have lost teeth because of a lack of dental care. One died of unknown causes while incarcerated, according to the Japanese Foreign Ministry.
Japanese consular officers came to visit Suzuki once a month. But they offered little support, he said. When he asked one of the diplomats to make his case public, he said, he got a scolding: “They asked me, ‘Do you want to be any more famous than you already are?’”
When he finally returned home in October, he found that hardly anyone had heard about his detention, he said.
Nobuyuki Fukushima, a member of the lower house of Japan’s parliament, said the Japanese Foreign Ministry had ignored his requests for updates about Suzuki’s case.
In response to questions from The New York Times about Suzuki’s detention, the ministry said that it could not discuss details of individual cases, but that, in general, it offered “as much support as possible” to detained Japanese citizens.
Japanese analysts attribute the surge in arrests to China’s introduction in 2014 and 2015 of new national security laws that targeted those deemed foreign spies and their local collaborators and expanded the scope of possible espionage claims.
The charges in spying cases vary but often appear to be arbitrary. Chinese law takes a broad view of what constitutes a state secret, including information that would be considered innocuous in other countries, said Bonji Ohara, a senior fellow at Sasakawa Peace Foundation and a former Japanese naval attache in China.
“What’s illegal is not clearly defined, so it’s difficult for people who are active there to assess what they need to avoid,” he said.
Five of the 17 Japanese citizens detained on charges of violating state secrets laws, including the pharmaceutical executive, are jailed. A few weeks ago, another Japanese citizen received a 12-year sentence for spying, Japan’s Foreign Ministry reported.
But detentions of Japanese nationals go much further back. In 2010, China arrested four Japanese citizens who were accused of taking videos of military installations. Their detention came after Japan had taken into custody a Chinese ship captain whose trawler crashed into Japanese coast guard vessels near islands disputed by the two countries.
Shin Kawashima, a University of Tokyo professor, said that he stopped traveling to China for research in 2019, after the arrest of Nobu Iwatani, a professor of Chinese history. Iwatani spent about two months in detention before finally confessing to violating China’s espionage law, an admission that appears to have been made under duress.
Beijing has long viewed Japan as an enemy, and “it’s so easy for them to imagine Japanese spies are everywhere,” Kawashima said.
That’s especially true for those who speak the language and have deep networks in the country, he said. “The better you know China, the more suspicious they become of you,” he said.
China blamed the Japanese government for the arrests. Speaking at a regular news briefing late last month, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, confirmed the latest detention and chided Tokyo for the significant number of Japanese arrested on spying charges in recent years.
“The Japanese side needs to do more to ask their citizens not to engage in such activities,” she said.
With Japan’s prosperity dependent on its access to China’s huge markets, the country is “the easiest to push around,” said Ichiro Korogi, a professor at Kanda University of International Studies who is an expert on Chinese politics.
That may be changing now as Japan takes a harder line on China. That, in part, is a response to Beijing’s crackdown on Hong Kong and its draconian handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also sharpened concern in Japan that China could take similar action against Taiwan, destabilizing the region.
Suzuki hopes China will recognize that its treatment of Japanese citizens is working against both countries’ interests.
In the meantime, Japan needs to “take a stand and create a strong system for crisis management,” he said. “Otherwise, the next time someone is detained, there won’t be any chance of saving them.”

TikTok's Strident Defenders? Chinese Officials.: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company has tried to distance itself, but the information push shows just how deeply invested Beijing is in its fate.
When members of Congress grilled TikTok's chief executive last month on Capitol Hill, the app's supporters sprang to its defense online.
The lawmakers were "old, tech-illiterate," one said. "Out of touch, paranoid and self-righteous," said another. The hourslong hearing "destroyed the illusion that US leads in cyber era," read another post.
These particular barbs did not come from TikTok's users -- 150 million and counting in the United States -- but from representatives of China's government.
In an information campaign primarily run on Twitter, Chinese officials and state media organizations widely mocked the United States in the days before and after the hearing, accusing lawmakers of hypocrisy and even xenophobia for targeting the popular app, according to a report released on Thursday by the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a nonpartisan initiative from the German Marshall Fund.
TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese technology company ByteDance, has sought to assure American lawmakers that it is independent from China's influence, and that it has extensive plans for securing Americans' data and providing oversight of its content recommendations. Shou Chew, TikTok's chief executive, explicitly said at the House hearing that ByteDance was "not owned or controlled by the Chinese government."
China's information push, however, showed just how deeply invested Beijing was in the company's fate. Just hours before Mr. Chew's testimony last month, China's Commerce Ministry said it opposed a sale of TikTok in a direct rebuke of the Biden administration, which is pushing a sale.
Chinese officials "clearly feel a stake in it," said Michael H. Posner, a former assistant secretary of state and now director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at the Stern School of Business at New York University.
The report from the Alliance for Securing Democracy found that Twitter accounts from Chinese diplomats and state media outlets posted nearly 200 tweets about TikTok in the week around the congressional hearing on March 23. That compared with fewer than 150 posts in all of January and February.
Chinese state media accounts also ran more than 30 stories about TikTok in outlets like China Daily, the report said. The researchers said in an interview that they had found similar content on Facebook and YouTube.
Asked about its support for TikTok, China's foreign ministry said it opposed American actions that violate market principles and rules under the World Trade Organization to target foreign companies. "What the U.S. should do is to stop smearing and slandering, and provide a fair, just, open, and nondiscriminatory business environment for companies from all over the world," the statement said.
China's effort has echoes of its defense of another Chinese company that has found itself in the cross hairs of American legal and political controversy: Huawei, the telecommunications giant, which the United States has identified as a potential national security threat.
The scale and tone of China's criticism of the U.S. government have intensified, though, reflecting the sharp deterioration of relations between the two countries despite a halting effort last year by President Biden and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, to reverse the decline.
"This is how the U.S. talks to the world," a spokeswoman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hua Chunying, wrote last month on Twitter, in English, with the hashtag #TikTokHearing.
Her post, which was retweeted more than 1,200 times, included a clip from TikTok showing Representative Kat Cammack, Republican of Florida, who during the hearing called the app "an extension" of the Communist Party of China. When Mr. Chew asked for a chance to respond, Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Republican of Washington and the chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said it was time to move on.
"What I think is surprising is how direct the attacks against U.S. lawmakers were," said Etienne Soula, a research analyst at the Alliance for Securing Democracy who wrote the report with Lindsay Gorman. "It's par for the course for them to go after the U.S. system in general, saying it's dysfunctional, that democracy doesn't work and that it's not a real democracy." It is far less common, he added, to see "very open insults."
Chinese officials, including diplomats around the globe, have become adept at using social media -- including platforms like Twitter and Facebook that are banned in China -- to spread their political views to an international audience. The latest campaign, however, sought to directly influence the political debate in the United States.
Posts by officials and state media mocked the political process. At least one stoked speculation of a potential "Gen Z rebellion" if lawmakers or the administration succeeded in banning the app or forcing its sale, as the Biden administration had been proposing.
"China is careful not to interfere with other countries' internal affairs or internal politics, so to have them weigh in so openly to encourage voters to riot -- it's outside the ordinary," Mr. Soula said.
Other posts compared tense photos of the roughly five-hour hearing with pictures of Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, who was visiting China around the same time and smiling and posing with locals.
"Isn't it clear which side supports free trade and which side is against it?" said a post from the Twitter account of Global Times, a nationalist paper owned by the Communist Party.
Still others sought to deflect attention from TikTok, asking why lawmakers were highlighting its risks to young people while "doing nothing on gun-control legislation." They also called the criticism of the app "xenophobic." (TikTok's chief operating officer has also said calls to ban the app are xenophobic.)
More recently, Chinese state media outlets have continued to push the campaign on their Twitter accounts, with China Daily posting an article on March 31 titled: "US says China can spy with TikTok. It spies on world with Google."'
On TikTok itself, many users also rallied behind the company and Mr. Chew, who has become an unexpected celebrity. The hashtag #TikTokBan has been viewed more than two billion times. Brooke Oberwetter, a spokeswoman for TikTok, said Mr. Chew's popularity on the platform had increased organically.
The Alliance for Securing Democracy did not track Chinese propaganda on TikTok's service as part of the report. Several Chinese media outlets already have accounts on the app. Their accounts and videos are identified with labels that say "China state-controlled media," and their profiles have fewer followers than they do on Twitter, suggesting that the latter remains the principal platform for China's global messaging.
"We label state-affiliated media so our community is clear if they are engaging with content that may be controlled or influenced by a government," Ms. Oberwetter said. "This is an ongoing process, and we'll continue to review new accounts and add labels as and when they join the platform."
CGTN, the English-language channel of the Chinese state television network, posted a TikTok video on March 24 that featured defenses of the platform from some of the influencers the company flew to Washington to help defend it before the hearing.
"When it comes to hot-button topics involving autocratic actors, it can be difficult to tell the difference between organic arguments and arguments derived from autocratic propaganda, even in open, democratic information spaces," the Alliance for Securing Democracy said in its report. "Should geopolitical debates occur on Chinese-owned social media platforms like TikTok going forward, it could become even more difficult to differentiate between organic arguments and propaganda."
The potential to shape public opinion is one of the major security concerns that American intelligence officials have raised about TikTok.
"If there are 150 million U.S. users, and God knows how many in the rest of the world," Mr. Posner said, "it's a platform for disinformation just waiting to be exercised."

Inside Policing Tools That Change The Game: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A brain wave reader that can detect lies. Miniaturized cameras that sit inside vape pens and disposable coffee cups. Massive video cameras that zoom in more than a kilometer to capture faces and license plates.
At a police conference in Dubai in March, new technologies for the security forces of the future were up for sale. Far from the eyes of the general public, the event provided a rare look at what tools are now available to law enforcement around the world: better and harder-to-detect surveillance, facial recognition software that automatically tracks individuals across cities and computers to break into phones.
Advances in artificial intelligence, drones and facial recognition have created an increasingly global police surveillance business. Israeli hacking software, American investigation tools and Chinese computer vision algorithms can all be bought and mixed together to make a snooping cocktail of startling effectiveness.
Fueled by a surge of spending from Middle Eastern countries such as the United Arab Emirates -- the conference's host and an aggressive adopter of next-generation security technologies -- the event pointed to how tools of mass surveillance once believed to be widespread only in China are proliferating. The rising use of the technologies signals an era of policing based as much on software, data and code as on officers and weaponry, raising questions about the effects on people's privacy and how political power is wielded.
"A lot of surveillance could ostensibly be benign or used to improve a city," said Daragh Murray, a senior lecturer of law at Queen Mary University in London who has studied police use of technology. "But the flip side of the coin is it can give you incredible insight into people's everyday lives. That can have an unintended chilling effect or be a tool for actual repression."
The gold rush was evident at a convention center in the heart of downtown Dubai, where uniformed police representatives from around the world browsed drones that could be launched and powered up remotely. Chinese camera makers showed software to identify when crowds gather. American companies like Dell and Cisco had booths offering police services. Cellebrite, an Israeli maker of systems to break into mobile phones, exhibited inside a "government zone" blocked off from the rest of the conference.
Other companies sold facial recognition eyeglasses and sentiment analysis software, in which an algorithm determines a person's mood from facial expressions. Some products, like a Segway with a rifle mount, pushed the limits of practicality.
"Nowadays, the police force, they don't think about the guns or weapons that they're carrying," said Maj. Gen. Khalid Alrazooqi, the Dubai Police's general director of A.I. "You're looking for the tools, the technology."
With its deep pockets, serious security challenges and autocratic government, the Emirates, an important American ally in the Middle East, has become a case study in the potential, and risks, of such policing technologies. The tools can help stop crime and terror attacks but can also become an undemocratic buttress of political power.
Under the leadership of Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, often referred to by his initials, M.B.Z., Emirati authorities have surveilled critics and activists. Amnesty International and other groups have accused the oil-rich country of human rights abuses against adversaries, including using the Pegasus phone spyware made by the NSO Group of Israel. Protests and free expression in the authoritarian monarchy are severely limited, part of what the government has said is an effort to combat Islamic extremism.
One tech firm based in the Emirates with ties to the country's leadership, Presight AI, sells software nearly identical to products that are popular with the Chinese police. At the conference, its software used cameras and A.I. to identify people, store data about their appearance and track their routes as they wandered the event.
A lack of transparency and oversight for the way surveillance technologies are used opens up the potential for abuse, said Marc O. Jones, author of the book "Digital Authoritarianism in the Middle East" and a professor at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar.
"The region has become so securitized, and under M.B.Z., the U.A.E. has become so focused on security there's almost this fetishization of technology," he said.
Cameras are especially prevalent in the two largest emirates, Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Dubai, which is flashier and more freewheeling, has cameras tucked away in unassuming corners. In Abu Dhabi, the more conservative center of political power, cameras dominate the cityscape. Grey metal towers that support them shaped like T's and L's hang over roads at predictable intervals.
General Alrazooqi, the Dubai Police's A.I. general director, said in an interview that the cameras were part of a yearslong campaign to become a global leader in police technology -- even though the emirate, which has a population of about 3.5 million, is known for low crime. In recent years, Emirati officials visited police departments and companies in China, Europe and the United States for ideas. The consulting companies KPMG and Gartner were hired to help with the process, the general said. Dubai bought facial recognition systems from Chinese companies including Hikvision and Huawei.
KPMG, Gartner, Huawei and Hikvision declined to comment.
"We pick what is the best practice in each country and to try to perfect and inject it in the system that we have," General Alrazooqi said. He added that the "Chinese are the best" at computer vision and facial recognition.
The Middle East has become a "petri dish of different actors," with China, Russia and the United States vying for influence through their technologies, Mr. Jones said. The heavy presence of Chinese technologies -- most cameras visible on the streets are Chinese -- is a sign of the country's rising influence in the Persian Gulf.
Dubai's police run next-generation systems from a headquarters north of the downtown skyscrapers and malls. One of those systems, a citywide facial recognition program called Oyoon -- Arabic for eyes -- can pull the identity of anyone passing one of at least 10,000 cameras, linking to a database of images from airport customs and residents' identification cards. The police have also required businesses to provide video from their security systems to a centralized government database.
"It's monitoring the whole city from once you enter at the airport to when you leave," General Alrazooqi said. He said the systems served the police's "customers" -- a catchall term for the public. "People, they are happy about it," he said.
The technological abilities were on display in a police command center, where Dubai's officers could view live camera feeds and the locations of all emergency vehicles on a giant screen.
"With technology and smart cameras, if you committed a crime within a minute I will know which direction" someone is going, said Lt. Col. Bilal Al Tayer, acting director of the command and control center.
One advanced tool was predictive policing software built by engineers from Dubai with machine learning that identifies where thieves might strike next. Officials said its 68 percent accuracy rate doubled that of an older model. Inside some patrol cars, mapping software gives officers specific routes to drive based on crime data.
Another algorithm, built on the records of automobile accidents, predicted the roughly 4,000 most dangerous drivers in Dubai, who will receive reminders via text message to drive carefully. The most represented category of bad drivers was older Emirati men, followed by older South Asian men. (Nationality is a factor for the algorithm.)
At the Dubai police fair, officials from the Emirates' Ministry of Interior, which oversees state security and has access to all police cameras, demonstrated how, with a tablet, they could scan the irises of conference attendees and pull up information about when they had entered the country, complete with a recent customs photo. Also displayed was a headset that is said to detect when a part of the brain concerning memories is activated, something a ministry official said was useful during interrogations to determine if a suspect was lying.
Walking among the booths at the conference was Lt. Gen. Abdullah Khalifa Al Marri, the Dubai Police's commander in chief. The new abilities on display, however intrusive, are a means to achieve a long-elusive, utopian goal of "zero crime," he said.
"We don't break the privacy of the people," he added. "We are just monitoring."

INTERNATIONAL
An article on Monday about Russian shelling that killed six civilians in Ukraine referred incorrectly to the number of civilians killed in Ukraine. The United Nations has recorded roughly 8,400 civilian deaths, not roughly 18,000, since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.
BUSINESS
An article on Saturday about Huawei Technologies' plunge in annual profit referred imprecisely to the sale of Huawei's mobile phone division. The company sold off a portion of that business, not all of it.
SPORTS
An article on Monday about the limited number of spots in the Women's National Basketball Association misspelled the name of a basketball player. It is Brittney Griner, not Britney.
OBITUARIES
An obituary on March 23 about the journalist Warren Boroson misstated the location of Memorial High School, which he attended. It is in West New York, N.J. -- not West Nyack, N.Y.

Huawei Reports Plunge in Profits After Sanctions: [Correction]

Full text: The company blamed the decline on pandemic lockdowns and an increase in research and development to counter restrictions on access to U.S. technology.
The Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies reported a nearly 70 percent plunge in annual profit on Friday, a setback that encapsulated the economic scars brought on by escalating U.S. sanctions, higher commodity prices and lingering pandemic restrictions.
Net profit in 2022 slid 69 percent from the year before to 35.6 billion yuan, or just over $ 5 billion, Huawei said Friday at an annual conference in Shenzhen, China. But the company was able to eke out a 0.9 percent gain in revenue, to 642.3 billion yuan.
The company blamed the decline on pandemic lockdowns and U.S. sanctions, rising commodity prices set off by supply-chain disruptions, a ramp-up in investment in research and development, and a one-time jump in profit the year prior from the sale of its mobile phone branch Honor.
Huawei has served as a symbol for the tech competition between Washington and Beijing, becoming a bellwether for how China's tech companies adapted to the United States' global campaign to cut off China's access to critical technologies.
American officials have long suspected that Huawei had close ties to the Chinese government, concerned that its technologies, such as 5G telecommunications equipment, could be used as surveillance tools. Huawei, a private company, denies it has any state ties.
The Trump administration began to restrict semiconductor sales to Huawei in 2019. Last year, the Biden administration expanded those controls, cutting Huawei's access to both U.S. consumers and suppliers and issuing a punishing freeze on chip-making equipment to large swaths of China's semiconductor industry.
Those moves amounted to a "near complete embargo of U.S. technology and U.S. goods" to Huawei, said Daniel B. Pickard, a lawyer at Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney and an expert on U.S. export controls. "I always think about Cuba, stuck in the 1950s and 1960s purely as a result of a unilateral embargo by the United States."
The steep drop in profit, as well as Huawei's acknowledgment of its economic challenges, was emblematic of the new economic reality for some Chinese companies. Last week, the chief executive of TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, withstood five hours of hostile questioning at a hearing before U.S. lawmakers.
On Friday, Huawei executives acknowledged the mounting geopolitical challenges, while striking a tone of defiance. China's semiconductor industry has gone through a "continuous stream of sanctions," said Eric Xu, the rotating chairman of Huawei, adding that "China's semiconductor industry will not sit idly by, but will take efforts around self-saving, self-strengthening and self reliance."
In recent years, Huawei has diversified its businesses in an effort to wean itself off American parts. After selling off a portion of its smartphone business, the company said, it moved into cloud computing and stepped up integration of software and hardware used in manufacturing systems and smart cars.
Huawei said it had also invested heavily in research and development, including a semiconductor investment fund begun in 2019 as Washington stepped up sanctions. The fund has backed more than 80 Chinese companies.
Mr. Xu said Huawei, together with a number of Chinese firms, had developed chip design tools to enable Chinese companies to make more advanced semiconductors. He heralded it as a boon for China's chip sector.
But analysts were skeptical of Mr. Xu's claim, pointing to the challenges of doing so without American parts or American-sponsored machinery.
"There are a lot of questions," said Douglas Fuller, an associate professor at the Copenhagen Business School and an expert on American export controls. "Is it a one-off for some specific chip involving tools of dubious intellectual property origins?"
Joining Mr. Xu was Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who had returned 18 months earlier from a nearly three-year extradition battle on fraud charges related to Huawei.
Ms. Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei, was set to take on a six-month rotation as the chief executive on Saturday, a sign of her rising role in China's efforts at technological stardom.
At the conference, she spoke bluntly about the company's situation. When a reporter asked how Huawei could square its claim of financial stability with an enormous decline in profit, she replied: "Overall, we still exist, and we will continue to exist. That is the best embodiment of financial robustness."

Under Xi, China Is Distancing Itself From Nations That Helped It Rise: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Chinese leader has edged ever closer to Russia, while distancing China from countries that have helped it develop over the past four decades.
In late 1978, China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, set in motion two major policy shifts that would change China and the world order in the decades to come. At a Communist Party meeting that December, the leadership declared that China would turn its focus from political struggle to economic development. Within days, China and the United States announced that they would establish diplomatic relations.
These two events marked the end of China as a hermit country where one billion people lived in extreme poverty and the start of its evolution into a superpower.
It was no coincidence that the country's economic reform and opening up to the outside world went hand in hand. "China cannot develop in isolation from the world," Mr. Deng declared.
Now both policies are in jeopardy. China's current paramount leader, Xi Jinping, who has just started his third term as the nation's president, has reversed many of the policies that propelled China's economic rise. During his visit to Moscow this week, Mr. Xi also aligned his country closer to Russia while alienating countries that helped China develop over the past four decades.
The prospect of international isolation unnerves many people in China. They worry that China has landed itself in the "wrong" camp, just as it did after the Communist Party took over the country in 1949 and joined the Soviet bloc, only to have a falling-out, and then a border clash, with the Soviet Union.
With Mr. Xi's visit, China has made it clear to the world which side it has chosen. It has also made it much easier for the United States to persuade American allies to join efforts in containing China.
"The fault line between the two camps is becoming increasingly sharper," Hu Wei, a political scholar in Shanghai, said in an interview. "I have long said that if China cannot make a flexible choice in the Russia-Ukraine war, it will be further isolated."
Immediately after Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year, Mr. Hu, in a commentary, criticized China's position on the war. He predicted that the West would be more united, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would continue to expand and China could become an international pariah if it didn't distance itself from Russia. His article was censored within China.
The "Iron Curtain" would "fall again not only from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea, but also to the final confrontation between the Western-dominated camp and its competitors," he wrote. "If China does not take proactive measures to respond, it will encounter further containment from the U.S. and the West."
That's already happening. In a recent speech, Mr. Xi criticized Western countries for their "all-around containment, encirclement and suppression of China" led by the United States. He said it "has brought unprecedented severe challenges to our country's development."
China is experiencing sharp drops in both export and foreign direct investment, as many multinational companies move some or all of their supply chains out of China. The country's economic policy has become much more unpredictable under Mr. Xi, especially during the "zero Covid" lockdowns last year. And the combination of American trade tariffs and export controls has made navigating China tricky for multinational businesses.
The Biden administration has been trying to persuade others to coordinate on its China policies, especially in blocking access to advanced technologies. U.S. allies, including Japan and the Netherlands, have pledged not to sell their most advanced semiconductor machinery to China. Britain, after wavering for a while on the infrastructure backbone of its 5G build-out, decided against buying equipment from Huawei.
"The Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine have reinforced the negative perception of China within the European Union," a group of Chinese researchers wrote in a report. "China's image in Europe is implicated by its association with Russia."
Liberal-minded Chinese whisper in private that China's refusal to condemn Russia's invasion, and Mr. Xi's friendship with Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, have both made alliance building by the United States much easier -- and made their own lives much tougher.
Chinese businesspeople have found it hard to expand in the West, since many countries have enacted strict rules regarding Chinese investment. Manufacturers have had to move parts of their supply chains outside the country if they want to retain Western clients working to reduce their exposure to China. Many Chinese workers have lost their jobs as a result.
Chinese tech companies are facing significant scrutiny. Citing national security concerns, the U.S. government is pushing ByteDance, the Chinese internet company, to sell TikTok, its popular short-video app, or face a ban in the country. The United States has already banned the app's use on government devices, as have Canada, Britain and European Union nations. TikTok's chief executive, Shou Chew, testified in Congress on Thursday.
Feng Yujun, a professor and a top Russia expert at Fudan University in Shanghai, argued in a speech in December that China has paid too much, economically and politically, for its ties with Russia, according to a transcript of his speech.
"We not only need to maintain a long-term friendly cooperative relationship with Russia but also need to maintain a constructive partnership with the United States, because our relationship with the U.S. will determine China's overall international environment in the future," he said.
Mr. Xi has rapidly been changing the direction Mr. Deng laid out. He did not follow the former leader's guidance that China bide its time and hide its abilities while developing itself. Instead, Mr. Xi bragged about China's tech power when nearly all of it was built atop Western technologies.
He also has turned China's cooperative diplomats into confrontational warriors on the international stage. Under him, the Chinese government has repeatedly tried to use its economic weight to coerce any company or any government that dared to criticize it.
Mr. Deng was once asked why China attached such importance to its relationship with the United States. He replied, "Looking back over the past few decades, every country that has had good relations with the U.S. has become prosperous," according to a memoir by a top expert on the United States, Li Shenzhi, a well-known liberal intellectual.
Under Mr. Xi, Chinese relations with the United States have turned antagonistic. By contrast, he calls Mr. Putin a "dear friend" and seeks to strengthen economic ties with Russia, whose output is close to that of Guangdong Province in southern China and with which China had a bitter, humiliating history during both the Imperial and Communist periods.
Mr. Hu, the scholar, said in the interview that it was not true that the United States had always tried to contain China. The United States let China into the World Trade Organization. It increased trade with China. It provided technologies and management expertise when China had nothing. Why did U.S.-Chinese relations turn sour? he asked. Who should be responsible?
"I won't discuss this, because it's a sensitive issue," he said. "I don't think the responsibility lies with the U.S."
He says China has no reason to complain that the United States doesn't help it anymore. "Why should I help you if we are no longer friends?" he asked. "Isn't it foolish to help make your competitor stronger?"
In the end, foreign policy decisions should be based on whether they help China achieve modernization and improve people's lives, Mr. Hu said -- not whether a leader likes a certain foreign country or not.
For the first anniversary of the war in Ukraine, Mr. Hu wrote a follow-up article. He asked whether Mr. Putin would still have gone ahead with his "special military operation" if he had known how it would turn out.
"History does not entertain 'what ifs,' and what is lost can never be regained," he wrote. "We can only learn from the lessons, try our best to not cling obstinately to our course and to never repeat past mistakes."
He concluded: "What is the most tragic is to witness a nation that does not remember its past mistakes."
His article was about Russia, but he might as well have been talking about China.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Brokering a rapprochement between the Middle Eastern rivals underscores the Chinese leader's ambition of offering an alternative to a U.S.-led world order.
When Beijing stepped into the role of mediator this week in the surprise rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran, it signaled a new level of ambition for Xi Jinping, China's top leader, who has sought to burnish his image as a global statesman in an escalating rivalry with the United States.
China's top diplomat quickly attributed the success of four days of secret talks in reviving diplomatic ties between the two archrivals to Mr. Xi's leadership, which he said demonstrated "the bearing of a great power."
By taking credit for striking a peace deal in the Middle East, Mr. Xi is seizing on waning American influence in the region and presenting Chinese leadership as an alternative to a Washington-led order he depicts as driving the world toward a new cold war.
"This is a battle of narratives for the future of the international order," said Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, a Washington-based research institute. "China is saying the world is in chaos because U.S. leadership has failed."
The vision Mr. Xi has laid out is one that wrests power from Washington in favor of multilateralism and so-called noninterference, a word that China uses to argue that nations should not meddle in each other's internal affairs, by criticizing human rights abuses, for example.
The Saudi-Iran agreement reflects this vision. China's engagement in the region has for years been rooted in delivering mutual economic benefits and shunning Western ideals of liberalism that have complicated Washington's ability to expand its presence in the Gulf.
In December, Mr. Xi reminded the world of China's growing clout with Saudi Arabia, a longtime U.S. ally. On a visit that month to Riyadh for talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's de facto ruler, he was treated to an aeronautical spectacle by the Royal Saudi Air Force. The hero's welcome stood in stark contrast to an earlier meeting between President Biden and Prince Mohammed, remembered as the American leader's most fraught foreign visit, when he sought to avoid a handshake with a fist bump that was no less awkward.
Two months later, Mr. Xi rolled out the red carpet for Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in Beijing, greeting him with a 21-gun salute in Tiananmen Square in a show of respect that Mr. Raisi -- the authoritarian leader of a nation accused of secretly building nuclear weapons -- would have never received in North American or European capitals.
"The U.S. is supporting one side and suppressing the other, while China is trying to make both parties move closer. It is a different diplomatic paradigm," said Wu Xinbo, dean of international studies at Shanghai's Fudan University.
If China becomes a more energetic power broker in the Middle East, that would be a big shift from an approach that has centered largely on promoting trade and investment in the resource-rich region rather than wading into seemingly intractable conflicts. China dipped its toes into Middle East diplomacy in 2013 by offering a four-point plan that rehashed old ideas for solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That failed to achieve a breakthrough.
By contrast, easing the conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia posed less of a challenge. China was well positioned to use its leverage to bring them to the table, given its strong economic and trading ties with each.
China is Saudi Arabia's largest trading partner; Saudi Arabia is one of China's largest suppliers of oil. Unlike Washington, China professes a willingness to do business without strings attached. Beijing has accepted Riyadh's explanation for the 2018 murder of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi and in turn, the Saudis have rebuffed efforts to condemn China's mass detention of Muslim Uyghurs.
China has had diplomatic relations with Iran since 1971 -- about two decades longer than it has with Saudi Arabia. China promised Iran in 2021 to invest $ 400 billion in the country in exchange for supplies of oil and fuel, though Western sanctions against Tehran have prevented Beijing from making good on the deal.
Analysts say Mr. Xi considers Iran strategically important chiefly as a like-minded critic of the West, and a nation rich in natural resources with strategic borders, a battle-hardened military and the stature of a civilization as old as China's.
China also has an interest in the region's stability. Beijing receives more than 40 percent of its crude oil imports from the region. Moreover, the Gulf has emerged as a key node along its Belt and Road Initiative trade routes, as well as a major market for Chinese consumer goods and technology. The Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei provides 5G networks in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.
Still, Ms. Sun, the analyst, said it was important not to overstate the significance of Friday's deal.
Saudi-Iranian differences run deep along sectarian lines, and it will take more than renewed diplomatic relations to mend ties. China's role in brokering the agreement also may not be as pivotal as it seems, given indications that Tehran and Riyadh were already motivated to strike an accord.
"Saudi Arabia and Iran have been talking about rehabilitating their relations for quite some time. So this is not something Beijing facilitated overnight," she said.
What most likely happened, Ms. Sun said, was a convergence of interests, in which an embattled and isolated Iran gained relief; Saudi Arabia got to send a message to Washington about the costs of reducing engagement in the region; and Mr. Xi was able to claim prestige as a global leader in the face of mounting American pressure.
"This is not China bringing two countries together and solving their differences," Ms. Sun said. "This is China exploiting the opportunity of two countries who want to improve their relations to begin with."
For Mr. Xi in particular, the deal offered a quick victory on the day he extended his dominance of Chinese politics by securing a third term as president.
After three years of Covid-induced isolation, Mr. Xi has quickly reasserted Beijing's presence on the global stage by meeting with dozens of heads of state and dispatching his top diplomat around the world to seek an edge as relations with the United States have deteriorated over accusations of Chinese espionage using high-altitude balloons, concern that Beijing is preparing to arm Russian forces in Ukraine and a growing anti-China tenor in Congress.
China has denied the weapons accusations and pushed back by asserting that it is a peacemaker, putting out a proposal last month to end the fighting in Ukraine. That proposal was effectively dismissed by European leaders, who have pressed Mr. Xi to use his influence over Moscow to stop the war.
Beijing has also sought to emphasize a plan called the Global Security Initiative, first introduced by Mr. Xi a year ago, that it describes as an effort to apply "Chinese solutions and wisdom" to the world's biggest security challenges.
The initiative, which reprises Mao-era language about promoting "peaceful coexistence," calls for a new paradigm in which global power is distributed more equally, and the world rejects "unilateralism, bloc confrontation and hegemonism" -- a reference to the United States and military alliances like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Some analysts say the initiative is essentially a bid to advance Chinese interests by displacing Washington as the world's policeman. The plan calls for respect of countries' "indivisible security," a Soviet term used to argue against U.S.-led alliances on China's periphery.
"A big part of the Global Security Initiative is essentially about delegitimizing security cooperation with the United States," said Manoj Kewalramani, a China studies fellow at the Takshashila Institution in India.
Wang Yi, China's top diplomat who hosted the closing ceremony of the talks in Beijing, said the deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran was an example of the Global Security Initiative's focus on promoting dialogue.
In photographs released by the Chinese state media, Mr. Wang presides over a handshake between Musaad al-Aiban, a Saudi minister of state, and Ali Shamkhani, Iran's secretary of the National Security Council, both of whom are smiling.
"We will continue to play a constructive role based on the wishes of each country in properly dealing with the hot-spot issues of the world," Mr. Wang said in remarks published on Friday.
In a thinly veiled criticism of the United States, he also said that China would support Middle Eastern countries in "casting off external interferences."

China Is Increasingly Seen As Playing a Spoiler Role In Diplomatic Discussions: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Tensions over China arise in many gatherings of global leaders and diplomats, as Beijing increasingly plays a spoiler role, often siding with Russia.
NEW DELHI -- When the top diplomats of four major Asia-Pacific nations met here in the Indian capital on Friday to discuss issues in the region, one had a direct message for the behemoth whose shadow loomed over the talk.
China must "act under the international institutions, standards and laws" to avoid conflict, Yoshimasa Hayashi, the foreign minister of Japan, said on a public panel that included his counterparts from the United States, India and Australia.
That request is one that every official on that stage has made on many occasions. Although Russia's war in Ukraine has dominated diplomatic dialogue around the globe this past year, the dilemma of dealing with an increasingly assertive China is ever-present -- and for many nations, a thornier problem than relations with Moscow. They subscribe to the framing that President Biden and his aides have presented: China is the greatest long-term challenge, and the one nation with the power and resources to reshape the American-led order to its advantage.
At the heart of this predicament is the fact that the United States and its allies maintain deep trade ties with China even as their security concerns and ideological friction with the nation's leader, Xi Jinping, and the Chinese Communist Party escalate.
For President Biden and his aides, that tension came into sharp focus in recent weeks after a Chinese spy balloon began drifting over the continental United States, and when, in their telling, they came across intelligence that China is considering sending weapons to Russia for its war. That prospect has prompted American diplomats and those from allies and partners to deliver warnings to Chinese counterparts, including here in New Delhi.
The anxieties over both China's and Russia's increasingly discordant roles on the world stage were perhaps wrapped into a lament on Thursday by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India that "multilateralism is in crisis today."
"Global governance has failed in both its mandates" of preventing wars and fostering international cooperation, he said in a video address to a conference of top diplomats from the Group of 20 nations, made up of the world's major economies, including China and Russia.
The four Asia-Pacific countries represented on the panel one day later at the Raisina Dialogue form the Quad partnership, which was revived in 2017 after many years of dormancy and has gained momentum since, mainly because of shared strategic concerns over China. But in a sign of the delicate balance they are trying to strike in relations with Beijing, the diplomats took pains to stress in their public comments that the Quad is not a security or military organization. Mr. Hayashi was the sole panelist to mention China, and only after being prompted by the panel's moderator.
Their joint statement, released after private meetings, did not mention China, although many points in it, including the issue of "peace and security in the maritime domain," are obviously aimed at Chinese policies.
At the earlier Group of 20 conference, the foreign minister of China, Qin Gang, joined the foreign minister of Russia, Sergey V. Lavrov, in playing the role of spoiler.
Together, they opposed two paragraphs in a proposed consensus communiqué, the first of which directly criticized Russia's war in Ukraine. Even though the leaders of the Group of 20 had approved the same two paragraphs in a consensus document at a meeting last year in Bali, Indonesia, China has dug in with Russia to sabotage both this week's communiqué and a similar one proposed at a G20 finance ministers' conference in late February in Bengaluru, India.
The second paragraph in the communiqué that they objected to did not mention Russia or Ukraine. It simply said that all the nations agreed to uphold United Nations principles on international humanitarian law, "including the protection of civilians and infrastructure in armed conflicts" and forbidding "the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons."
Some diplomats privately expressed surprise that China opposed a reiteration of such basic principles, a move that forced the conference to issue a lower-level chair's statement. Mr. Qin's stance seemed to validate concerns that his government was willing to side with Russia in a growing number of diplomatic venues -- including at the United Nations Security Council -- to undermine policies or actions that the vast majority of nations endorse.
"Russia and China were the only two countries that made clear that they would not sign on to that text," Antony J. Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, said pointedly at a news conference on Thursday night. He added that he agreed with Mr. Modi "that there are real challenges to the multilateral system."
He noted, too, that at the U.N. Security Council, "we have two countries in particular that tend to block the attempted actions of the council to address some of the most urgent global concerns."
Mr. Blinken has also expressed skepticism over a push by Beijing for peace negotiations in the war in Ukraine, saying Chinese officials are merely creating a smoke screen to buy Russia more time to press its assault.
Chinese officials say they will happily cooperate with countries in the international system, and that it is the United States fanning the flames of division with its "Cold War mentality."
China is ready to work with other Group of 20 nations to both "stay committed to solidarity and cooperation" and "play a bigger role in addressing major global economic and financial challenges," said Mao Ning, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, at a news conference in Beijing on Thursday as the meetings in New Delhi began.
After Mr. Blinken's critical remarks, Ms. Mao said Friday that Mr. Qin had urged the Group of 20 nations to engage in "real multilateralism" and avoid "power politics and camps of confrontation." She added that the G20 was an inappropriate venue for discussing Ukraine, and criticized the Quad partnership as a "closed small circle."
Ms. Mao also lashed out at an announcement by the U.S. Commerce Department on Thursday that it was restricting trade with 28 Chinese entities that American officials accused of violating U.S. sanctions, including certain bans on nuclear and missile technology sales. That move, Ms. Mao said, showed the United States was going to great lengths to "suppress Chinese enterprises."
The Biden administration has broadened an effort begun by the Trump administration to hobble Chinese companies that the U.S. government views as potential national security threats, including Huawei, China's most important communications technology company. Last October, Mr. Biden announced sweeping restrictions on selling advanced semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China, in what aides called an effort to end China's access to "foundational technologies."
The Biden administration is pushing two allies, Japan and the Netherlands, to also impose further limits on sales of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China. That subject might have come up when Mr. Blinken met in New Delhi with his Dutch and Japanese counterparts. The move is another manifestation of the Biden administration's belief that China can be constrained only by getting allies and partners on the same page.
And Mr. Blinken warned China on Thursday night of economic penalties if it went ahead with giving weapons to Russia: "We have sanctions authorities of various kinds," he said.
For world leaders, those irrepressible tensions are more evidence that the international system is cleaving into blocs, and that Mr. Modi's urgent plea to diplomats this week was falling on deaf ears: "Focus not on what divides us, but on what unites us."

Biden's Cybersecurity Strategy Urges Stricter Mandates for Tech Companies: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The policy document urges more mandates on the firms that control most of the nation's digital infrastructure, and an expanded government role to disrupt hackers and state-sponsored entities.
WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration issued a new cybersecurity strategy on Thursday that calls on software makers and American industry to take far greater responsibility to assure that their systems cannot be hacked, while accelerating efforts by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Defense Department to disrupt the activities of hackers and ransomware groups around the world.
For years, the government has pressed companies to voluntarily report intrusions in their systems and regularly patch their programs to fix newly discovered vulnerabilities, much as an iPhone does with automatic updates every few weeks.
But the new National Cybersecurity Strategy concludes that such good-faith efforts are helpful but insufficient in a world of constant attempts by sophisticated hackers, often backed by Russia, China, Iran or North Korea, to get into critical government and private networks. Instead, companies must be required to meet minimum cybersecurity standards, the new strategy contends.
The strategy is a policy document, not an executive order, although it represents a significant shift in attitude toward the "public-private partnerships" that the government has talked about for years. While some aspects of the new strategy are already in place, others would require legislative changes -- potentially a major challenge in a Republican-dominated Congress. And the federal government does not have the ability to impose cybersecurity requirements on state-run facilities like hospitals, which have been targeted by hackers.
"The fundamental recognition in the strategy is that a voluntary approach to securing" critical infrastructure and networks "is inadequate," Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technologies, said at an event at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
Every administration since that of George W. Bush, 20 years ago, has issued a cybersecurity strategy of some kind, usually once in a presidency. But President Biden's differs from previous versions in several respects, chiefly by urging far greater mandates on private industry, which controls the vast majority of the nation's digital infrastructure, and by expanding the role of the government to take offensive action to pre-empt cyberattacks, especially from abroad.
The Biden administration's strategy envisions what it calls "fundamental changes to the underlying dynamics of the digital ecosystem." If enacted into new regulations and laws, it would force companies to implement minimum cybersecurity measures for critical infrastructure -- and, perhaps, impose liability on firms that fail to secure their code, much like automakers and their suppliers are held liable for faulty airbags or defective brakes.
"It just reimagines the American cybersocial contract," said Kemba Walden, the acting national cyber director, a White House post created by Congress two years ago. "We are expecting more from those owners and operators in our critical infrastructure," added Ms. Walden, who took over last month after the country's first cyber director, Chris Inglis, a former deputy director of the National Security Agency, resigned.
The government also has a heightened responsibility, she added, to shore up defenses and disrupt the major hacking groups that have locked up hospital records or frozen the operations of meatpackers around the country, along with government operations in Baltimore, Atlanta and small towns across Texas.
"We have a duty to do that," Ms. Walden said, "because the internet is now a global commons, essentially. So we expect more from our partners in the private sector and the nonprofits and industry, but we also expect more of ourselves."
Read alongside the cybersecurity strategies issued by the previous three presidents, the new document reflects how offense and defense in the sphere have become increasingly central to national security policy.
The Bush administration never publicly acknowledged American cyberattack capabilities, even as it mounted the most sophisticated cyberattack one state has ever directed at another: a covert effort to use code to sabotage Iran's nuclear fuel facilities. The Obama administration was reluctant to name Russia and China as the powers behind major hacks of the U.S. government.
The Trump administration bolstered American offensive initiatives against hackers and state-backed actors abroad. It also raised the alarm about having Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant it accused of being an arm of the Chinese government, set up high-speed 5G networks in the United States and among allies, fearing that the company's control of such networks would aid in Chinese surveillance or allow Beijing to shut down systems at a time of conflict.
But the Trump administration was less active in requiring American companies to establish minimum protections on critical infrastructure, or seeking to make those firms liable for damage if vulnerabilities they had left unaddressed were exploited.
Imposing new forms of liability would require major legislative changes, and some White House officials acknowledged that Mr. Biden could face insurmountable opposition from Republicans in Congress if he sought to pass such sweeping new corporate regulations.
The Biden administration's move to establish corporate liability for failure to meet basic security needs "will have decades-long ramifications," said Glenn S. Gerstell, a former general counsel at the National Security Agency.
"In the cyberworld, we're finally saying that Ford is responsible for Pintos that burst into flames, because they didn't spend money on safety," he added, referring to the famously combustible car that was recalled in 1978.
Many elements of the new strategy are already in place. In some ways, it is catching up with steps the Biden administration took after struggling through its first year, which began with major hacks of systems used by both private industry and the military.
After a Russian ransomware group shut down the operations of Colonial Pipeline, which handles much of the gasoline and jet fuel along the East Coast, the Biden administration used little-known legal authorities held by the Transportation Security Administration to regulate the nation's vast network of energy pipelines. Pipeline owners and operators are now required to submit to far-reaching standards set largely by the federal government, and later this week, the Environmental Protection Agency is expected to do the same for water pipelines.
There are no parallel federal authorities for requiring minimum standards of cybersecurity at hospitals, which are largely regulated by states. Health centers have been another target of attacks, from Vermont to Florida.
"We should have been doing many of these things years ago after cyberattacks were first used to disrupt power to thousands of people in Ukraine," Ms. Neuberger said in an interview on Wednesday. She was referring to a series of attacks on the Ukrainian power grid that began seven years ago.
Now, she said, "we are literally cobbling together an approach sector by sector that covers critical infrastructure."
Ms. Neuberger cited Ukraine as an example of a proactive cyberdefense strategy: In the weeks after the Russian invasion, Ukraine changed its laws to allow ministries to move their databases and many government operations to the cloud, backing up computer servers and data centers around Kyiv and other cities that were later targets for Russian artillery. Within weeks, many of those server farms were destroyed, but the government kept running, communicating to servers abroad using satellite systems like Starlink, also brought in after the war broke out.
The U.S. strategy is catching up with its offensive program, which has become increasingly aggressive. Two years ago, the F.B.I. began to use search warrants to find and dismantle fragments of malicious code found on corporate networks. More recently, it hacked into the networks of a ransomware group, removed the "decryption keys" that would unlock documents and systems belonging to the group's victims and foiled efforts to collect large ransoms.
The F.B.I. can operate in domestic networks; it is up to U.S. Cyber Command to go after Russian hacking groups like Killnet, a pro-Moscow group responsible for a series of denial-of-service attacks starting in the early days of the war in Ukraine. Cyber Command also slowed the operations of Russian intelligence agencies around the 2018 and 2020 American elections.
But none of those are permanent solutions; some groups the United States has targeted have formulated themselves anew, often under different names.
Mr. Biden's only face-to-face meeting as president with Russia's leader, Vladimir V. Putin, in 2021 in Geneva, was driven largely by the fear that rising ransomware attacks were affecting the lives of consumers, hospital patients and factory workers. Mr. Biden warned the Russian leader that his government would be held responsible for attacks emanating from Russian territory.
There was a lull for a number of months, and a prominent hacking group was raided by Russian authorities in Moscow. But that cooperation ended with the opening of the war in Ukraine.
In a speech this week at Carnegie Mellon University, Jen Easterly, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, described the efforts of the administration as "shifting liability onto those entities that fail to live up to the duty of care they owe their customers."
"Consumers and businesses alike expect that products purchased from a reputable provider will work the way they are supposed to and not introduce inordinate risk," Ms. Easterly said. She added that the administration needed to "advance legislation to prevent technology manufacturers from disclaiming liability by contract," a common practice that few notice in the fine print of software purchases.

WASHINGTON — The Biden administration issued a new cybersecurity strategy Thursday that calls on software-makers and American industry to take far greater responsibility to assure that their systems cannot be hacked, while accelerating efforts by the FBI and the Defense Department to disrupt the activities of hackers and ransomware groups around the world.
For years, the government has pressed companies to voluntarily report intrusions in their systems and regularly “patch” their programs to fix newly discovered vulnerabilities, much as an iPhone does with automatic updates every few weeks.
But the new National Cybersecurity Strategy concludes that such good-faith efforts are helpful but insufficient in a world of constant attempts by sophisticated hackers, often backed by Russia, China, Iran or North Korea, to get into critical government and private networks. Instead, companies must be required to meet minimum cybersecurity standards, the new strategy contends.
The strategy is a policy document, not an executive order, although it represents a significant shift in attitude toward the “public-private partnerships” that the government has talked about for years. While some aspects of the new strategy are already in place, others would require legislative changes — potentially a major challenge in a Republican-dominated Congress. And the federal government does not have the ability to impose cybersecurity requirements on state-run facilities like hospitals, which have been targeted by hackers.
“The fundamental recognition in the strategy is that a voluntary approach to securing” critical infrastructure and networks “is inadequate,” Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technologies, said at an event at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
Every administration since that of George W. Bush, 20 years ago, has issued a cybersecurity strategy of some kind, usually once in a presidency. But President Joe Biden’s differs from previous versions in several respects, chiefly by urging far greater mandates on private industry, which controls the vast majority of the nation’s digital infrastructure, and by expanding the role of the government to take offensive action to preempt cyberattacks, especially from abroad.
The Biden administration’s strategy envisions what it calls “fundamental changes to the underlying dynamics of the digital ecosystem.” If enacted into new regulations and laws, it would force companies to enact minimum cybersecurity measures for critical infrastructure — and, perhaps, impose liability on firms that fail to secure their code, much like automakers and their suppliers are held liable for faulty air bags or defective brakes.
“It just re-imagines the American cybersocial contract,” said Kemba Walden, the acting national cyber director, a White House post created by Congress two years ago. “We are expecting more from those owners and operators in our critical infrastructure,” added Walden, who took over last month after the country’s first national cyber director, Chris Inglis, a former deputy director of the National Security Agency, resigned.
The government also has a heightened responsibility, she added, to shore up defenses and disrupt the major hacking groups that have locked up hospital records or frozen the operations of meatpackers around the country, along with government operations in Baltimore, Atlanta and small towns across Texas.
“We have a duty to do that,” Walden said, “because the internet is now a global commons, essentially. So we expect more from our partners in the private sector and the nonprofits and industry, but we also expect more of ourselves.”
Read alongside past cyberstrategies issued by the previous three presidents, the new document reflects how cyberoffense and -defense have become increasingly central to national security policy.
The Bush administration never publicly acknowledged U.S. offensive cybercapabilities, even as it mounted the most sophisticated cyberattack one state has ever directed at another: a covert effort to use code to sabotage Iran’s nuclear fuel facilities. The Obama administration was reluctant to name Russia and China as the powers behind major hacks of the U.S. government.
The Trump administration bolstered U.S. offensive initiatives against hackers and state-backed actors abroad. It also raised the alarm about having Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant it accused of being an arm of the Chinese government, set up high-speed 5G networks in the United States and among allies, fearing that the company’s control of such networks would aid in Chinese surveillance or allow Beijing to shut down systems at a time of conflict.
But the Trump administration was less active in requiring U.S. companies to establish minimum protections on critical infrastructure, or seeking to make those firms liable for damage if vulnerabilities they had left unaddressed were exploited.
Imposing new forms of liability would require major legislative changes, and some White House officials acknowledged that Biden could face insurmountable opposition from Republicans in Congress if he sought to pass such sweeping new corporate regulations.
The Biden administration’s move to establish corporate liability for failure to meet basic security needs “will have decadeslong ramifications,” said Glenn S. Gerstell, a former general counsel at the National Security Agency.
“In the cyberworld, we’re finally saying that Ford is responsible for Pintos that burst into flames, because they didn’t spend money on safety,” he added, referring to the famously combustible car that was recalled in 1978.
Many elements of the new strategy are already in place. In some ways, it is catching up with steps the Biden administration took after struggling through its first year, which began with major hacks of systems used by both private industry and the military.
After a Russian ransomware group shut down the operations of Colonial Pipeline, which handles much of the gasoline and jet fuel along the East Coast, the Biden administration used little-known legal authorities held by the Transportation Security Administration to regulate the nation’s vast network of energy pipelines. Pipeline owners and operators are now required to submit to far-reaching standards set largely by the federal government, and later this week, the Environmental Protection Agency is expected to do the same for water pipelines.
There are no parallel federal authorities for requiring minimum standards of cybersecurity at hospitals, which are largely regulated by states. Health centers have been another target of attacks, from Vermont to Florida.
“We should have been doing many of these things years ago after cyberattacks were first used to disrupt power to thousands of people in Ukraine,” Neuberger, said Wednesday.
She was referring to a series of attacks on the Ukrainian power grid that began seven years ago.
Now, she said, “we are literally cobbling together an approach sector by sector that covers critical infrastructure.”
Neuberger cited Ukraine as an example of proactive cyberdefense strategy: In the weeks after the Russian invasion, Ukraine changed its laws to allow ministries to move their databases and many government operations to the cloud, backing up computer servers and data centers around Kyiv and other cities that were later targets for Russian artillery. Within weeks, many of those server farms were destroyed, but the government kept running, communicating to servers abroad using satellite systems such as Starlink, also brought in after the war broke out.
The strategy is also catching up with an offensive program that has become increasingly aggressive. Two years ago, the FBI began to use search warrants to find and dismantle fragments of malicious code found on corporate networks. More recently, it hacked into the networks of a ransomware group, removed the “decryption keys” that would unlock documents and systems belonging to the group’s victims and foiled efforts to collect large ransoms.
The FBI can operate in domestic networks; it is up to the U.S. Cyber Command to go after Russian hacking groups such as Killnet, a pro-Moscow group responsible for a series of denial-of-service attacks starting in the early days of the war in Ukraine. The Cyber Command also slowed the operations of Russian intelligence agencies around the 2018 and 2020 U.S. elections.
But none of those are permanent solutions; some groups the United States has targeted have formulated themselves anew, often under different names.
Biden’s only face-to-face meeting as president with President Vladimir Putin of Russia, in 2021 in Geneva, was driven largely by the fear that rising ransomware attacks were affecting the lives of consumers, hospital patients and factory workers. Biden warned the Russian leader that his government would be held responsible for attacks emanating from Russian territory.
There was a lull for a number of months, and a prominent hacking group was raided by Russian authorities in Moscow. But that cooperation ended with the opening of the war in Ukraine.
In a speech this week at Carnegie Mellon University, Jen Easterly, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, described the efforts of the administration as “shifting liability onto those entities that fail to live up to the duty of care they owe their customers.”
“Consumers and businesses alike expect that products purchased from a reputable provider will work the way they are supposed to and not introduce inordinate risk,” Easterly said. She added that the administration needed to “advance legislation to prevent technology manufacturers from disclaiming liability by contract,” a common practice that few notice in the fine print of software purchases.

Bipartisan Plans on China Face Political Hurdles in Congress: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: With budgets tight and political knives drawn, lawmakers seeking to capitalize on a bipartisan urgency to confront China are setting their sights on narrower measures.
WASHINGTON -- Republicans and Democrats are pressing for major legislation to counter rising threats from China, but mere weeks into the new Congress, a bipartisan consensus is at risk of dissipating amid disputes about what steps to take and a desire among many Republicans to wield the issue as a weapon against President Biden.
In the House and Senate, leading lawmakers in both parties have managed in an otherwise bitterly divided Congress to stay unified about the need to confront the dangers posed by China's militarization, its deepening ties with Russia and its ever-expanding economic footprint.
But a rising chorus of Republican vitriol directed at Mr. Biden after a Chinese spy balloon flew over the United States this month upended that spirit -- giving way to G.O.P. accusations that the president was "weak on China" -- and suggested that the path ahead for any bipartisan action is exceedingly narrow.
"When the balloon story popped, so to speak, it felt like certain people used that as an opportunity to bash President Biden," said Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, the top Democrat on the select panel the House created to focus on competition with China.
"And it felt like no matter what he did, they wanted to basically call him soft on the C.C.P., and unable to protect America," he said, referring to the Chinese Communist Party. "That's where I think we can go wayward politically."
For now, only a few, mostly narrow ventures have drawn enough bipartisan interest to have a chance at advancing amid the political tide. They include legislation to ban TikTok, the Beijing-based social media platform lawmakers have warned for years is an intelligence-gathering gold mine for the Chinese government; bills that would ban Chinese purchases of farmland and other agricultural real estate, especially in areas near sensitive military sites; and measures to limit U.S. exports and outbound investments to China.
Such initiatives are limited in scope, predominantly defensive and relatively cheap -- which lawmakers say are important factors in getting legislation over the hurdles posed by this split Congress. And, experts point out, none are issues that would be felt keenly by voters, or translate particularly well into political pitches on the 2024 campaign trail.
"There would be nervousness among Republicans about giving the administration a clear win, but I'm just not sure that the kind of legislation they'll be looking at would be doing that," said Zack Cooper, who researches U.S.-China competition at the American Enterprise Institute. "It's more things that would penalize China than be focused on investing in the U.S. in the next couple of years."
At the start of the year, the momentum behind bipartisan efforts to confront China seemed strong, with Republicans and Democrats banding together to pass the bill setting up the select panel and legislation to deny China crude oil exports from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. A resolution condemning Beijing for sending the spy balloon over the United States passed unanimously after Republican leaders decided not to take the opportunity to rebuke Mr. Biden, as many on the right had clamored for.
But with partisan divisions beginning to intensify and a presidential election looming, it appears exceedingly unlikely that Congress will be able to muster an agreement as large or significant as the major legislation last year to subsidize microchip manufacturing and scientific research -- a measure that members of both parties described as only one of many policy changes that would be needed to counter China.
"The biggest challenge is just the overall politicized environment that we're in right now and the lack of trust between the parties," said Representative Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, the chairman of the new select panel, who has committed to make his committee an "incubator and accelerator" on China legislation. "Everyone has their guard up."
Still, there are some areas of potential compromise. Many lawmakers are eyeing 2023 as the year Congress can close any peepholes China may have into the smartphones of more than 100 million American TikTok users, but they have yet to agree on how to try to do so.
Some Republicans have proposed imposing sanctions to ice TikTok out of the United States, while Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, wants to allow the president to block the platform by lifting statutory prohibitions on banning foreign information sources.
Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Senator Angus King, independent of Maine and a member of the panel, want to prevent social media companies under Chinese or Russian influence from operating in the United States unless they divest from foreign ownership.
But none have yet earned a seal of approval from Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the Democrat who is chairman of the committee and whose support is considered critical to any bill's success. He was the chief architect of a bill to invest in the semiconductor industry that became a centerpiece of last year's sweeping China competition bill, known as the CHIPS and Science Act, and he wants to tackle foreign data collection more broadly.
"We've had a whack-a-mole approach on foreign technology that poses a national security risk," Mr. Warner said in an interview, bemoaning that TikTok was only the latest in a long line of foreign data firms, like the Chinese telecom giant Huawei and the Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab, to be targeted by Congress. "We need an approach that is constitutionally defensible."
There is a similar flurry of activity among Republican and Democratic lawmakers proposing bans on Chinese purchases of farmland in sensitive areas. But lawmakers remain split over how broad such a ban should be, whether agents of other adversary nations ought also to be subject to the prohibition, and whether Congress ought to update the whole process of reviewing foreign investment transactions, by including the Agriculture Department in the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an interagency group.
"It's actually kind of a more fraught issue than you would imagine," Mr. Gallagher said.
Lawmakers in both parties who want to put forth legislation to limit U.S. goods and capital from reaching Chinese markets are also facing challenges. The Biden administration has already started to take unilateral action on the issue, and further steps could box lawmakers out. Even if Congress can stake out a role for itself, it is not entirely clear which committee would take the lead on a matter that straddles a number of areas of jurisdiction.
Even before the balloon incident, existential policy differences between Republicans and Democrats, particularly around spending, made for slim odds that Congress could achieve sweeping legislative breakthroughs regarding China. Architects of last year's law were dour about the prospect of the current Congress attempting anything on a similar scale.
"The chances of us passing another major, comprehensive bill are not high," said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the lead Republican on last year's chips subsidies bill, who noted that with the slim G.O.P. majority in the House, it would be difficult to pass another costly investment measure.
G.O.P. lawmakers have been demanding cuts to the federal budget, and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, has indicated that even military spending might be on the chopping block. Though no one has specifically advocated cutting programs related to countering China, that has some lawmakers nervous, particularly since certain recent ventures Congress created to beef up security assistance to Taiwan have already failed to secure funding at their intended levels.
That backdrop could complicate even bipartisan ventures seeking to authorize new programs to counter China diplomatically and militarily, such as a proposal in the works from Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator James Risch of Idaho, the top Republican, to step up foreign aid and military assistance to American allies in Beijing's sphere of influence.
That likely means that action on any comprehensive China bill would need to be attached to another must-pass bill, such as the annual defense authorization bill, to break through the political logjams of this Congress, said Richard Fontaine, the CEO of the Center for a New American Security.
"China has risen as a political matter and things are possible that weren't before, but it has not risen so high as to make the hardest things politically possible," Mr. Fontaine said.

Full text: Beijing, in urgent need of reviving its economy, wants to mend ties with Europe but is struggling to create distance between itself and Moscow.
China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, has been on a high-stakes tour of Europe, defending his country's interests in a clash with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and reaffirming Beijing's friendship with Russia with a visit to Moscow.
But China is also trying to woo European nations in an urgent bid to revive its economy and to find common ground with some of Washington's staunchest allies in the region.
Mr. Wang's travels highlight the conundrum China faces as it tries to enhance its relationship with the European Union, its largest trading partner, without alienating Russia, the only other major power alongside China challenging American global dominance. His trip also has laid bare the constraints of Beijing's balancing act -- serving as Moscow's strategic lifeline and also professing to be a neutral bystander in a war raging on Western Europe's doorstep.
Mr. Wang promised the leaders of France and Germany that Beijing wanted to "fully restart exchanges" and increase cooperation on issues like climate change and free trade. He met with his Ukrainian counterpart, pledging to him that "China does not want to see the crisis being prolonged and escalated."
After meeting with Mr. Wang in Moscow on Tuesday, President Vladimir V. Putin's top security aide said Russia backed China on a range of issues.
"I want to reaffirm our invariable support for Beijing on the Taiwan, Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong issues, which the West is exploiting to discredit China," the aide, Nikolai P. Patrushev, told Mr. Wang, the Interfax news agency reported.
In a further assertion of the countries' close ties, China's top leader, Xi Jinping, is expected to pay a state visit to Moscow in the spring.
China's charm offensive has largely been overshadowed by U.S. accusations that China may be considering supplying Russia's beleaguered military with weapons and ammunition. Forced on the back foot, Mr. Wang, a seasoned diplomat known for his sharp suits and wispy eyebrows, had to provide reassurances and serve as a target for rebukes and warnings.
"I had a conversation with him, and I expressed our strong concern about China providing arms to Russia and asked him not to do that," Josep Borrell Fontelles, the top European Union diplomat, told reporters on Monday. "For us, it would be a red line in our relationship."
As Europe and the United States, again, pressure Beijing not to aid Russia's war, China has few options for responding. Even as it privately tries to soothe concerns, in public it has sought to look firm.
"It's the U.S., and not China, that has been incessantly supplying weapons to the battlefield, and the U.S. is not qualified to issue any orders to China," a spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Monday.
China's fiery rhetoric defending its ties with Russia will do little to reassure European officials. China has parroted Russian talking points in the past about how the expansion of NATO warranted the invasion of Ukraine.
After nearly two years of frosty relations marked by sanctions, the collapse of a major investment deal and a grueling war in Ukraine, European leaders were hoping to hear China moderate its tone and demonstrate a willingness to create more distance between itself and Moscow, analysts said.
Instead, Mr. Wang arrived at a security conference in Munich, and sharply ramped up a war of words with the United States over a spy balloon incident, describing Washington's response as "absurd and hysterical." Mr. Wang also declined to rule out a military confrontation over Taiwan -- the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its territory.
"China's charm offensive with Europe hit a wall in Munich," said Noah Barkin, a specialist on Chinese-European relations from the Rhodium Group, a research consultancy.
"At a conference celebrating trans-Atlantic unity on Ukraine, Wang chose to blame the United States for all evils," he added. "It was an epic misreading of the room."
His wider strategy, analysts said, was designed to appeal to Europe's sense of autonomy. The aim was to depict the United States' efforts to impose restrictions on trade with China and rally military support for Ukraine's defense as dragging the region toward a new cold war.
Europe has resisted moving in lock step with the United States, declining to blacklist Chinese companies on national security grounds. Huawei, for example, still has a large presence in Germany's telecommunications market. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, speaking at an economic forum in January, said Europe needs to focus on "de-risking, rather than decoupling" with China.
Analysts say China was likely hoping to win support from Europe's business community -- which has been clamoring to re-enter the Chinese market -- and tap into fears about the direction of the conflict in Ukraine, which will mark its first anniversary on Friday.
"China is making the argument that the war cannot be won, and Europe is becoming the victim of U.S. security strategy," said Yun Sun, the director of the China program at the Stimson Center, a Washington-based research institute.
Mr. Wang's trip, which took him to France, Italy, Germany, Hungary and Russia, came after years of strained relations between Europe and China.
The two sides have clashed over Beijing's crackdown on freedoms in Hong Kong starting in 2019, and the European Union's decision in 2021 to impose sanctions on Chinese officials over the mistreatment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, a far western Chinese region. China retaliated with sanctions on prominent European critics of Beijing.
Those tensions derailed a major economic deal between China and the European Union that would have given European companies in China greater legal protections and larger market access. The deal was agreed to in principle in 2020 but never signed.
China has been so eager to revive the trade agreement with Europe that its ambassador to the European Union, Fu Cong, suggested earlier this month that the two sides simultaneously lift their respective sanctions. But tensions over issues such as the treatment of Uyghurs still permeate the relationship: European lawmakers and activists protested a planned trip by the governor of Xinjiang to Europe, forcing China to call it off.
Analysts said it was no accident that Mr. Wang skipped Brussels, where the European Union -- which has led the pushback against Beijing -- is headquartered. With the exception of Munich, Mr. Wang's itinerary was free of controversy. His meetings in France and Italy involved two countries whose leaders were laying the groundwork to visit Beijing. And Hungary is widely regarded as China's closest friend in the European Union.
Mr. Barkin said the signal Mr. Wang's chosen destinations aimed to send was that "China has partners in Europe at a time when it is under pressure on many fronts."
But Beijing has little incentive to try to rein in Moscow. Russia's war in Ukraine is diverting Western resources and attention away from Asia, where Beijing is trying to establish its dominance. And, most crucially, a China aligned with Russia would be a far more daunting adversary to the United States should the world's two superpowers ever come to blows.
Still, analysts say China could downplay Mr. Xi's visit to Moscow to prevent ties with the West from deteriorating further. Mr. Xi could also visit Western European capitals first, and even hold a call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.
Much of that could depend on how much traction, if any, China receives by serving as a peace broker. Mr. Wang has hinted that Beijing would present a settlement plan for the war in Ukraine soon.
Skepticism abounds about any such plan, namely because European officials don't believe Beijing has the ability, or intention, to persuade Moscow to withdraw all its troops from Ukraine, which some leaders consider a prerequisite for any peace deal.
"China is good at calling for dialogues," said Ms. Sun. "That's cheap and easy. The hard part is what the settlement looks like and how to convince parties to accept it and implement it. That requires knowledge, impartiality and actual use of influence. China will not touch it with a 10-foot pole."

China Blends Private Firms With Military: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Chinese government has tried to meld its military and civilian innovation, prompting a backlash from the United States.
WASHINGTON -- A People's Liberation Army veteran turned drone manufacturer. A Shanghai real estate company that wagered there was more profit in high-altitude airships. An eminent Chinese aviation scientist who started more than a dozen companies to commercialize his expertise.
Each sought to help their business by supporting China's military modernization. Each now stands accused by the United States of helping to build China's spy balloons.
The international fracas over those high-altitude balloons has thrown a light on China's program of "military-civil fusion." Xi Jinping, China's leader, has pushed the recruiting of commercial businesses to help build what he has described as a world-class military guarding China's rise as a superpower. The aim is to create a symbiotic relationship that provides the military with wider, faster access to commercial innovations, while also giving businesses contracts and military skills.
Several Chinese makers of airships and their components that were blacklisted by the U.S. government last Friday over China's balloon program have ties to this effort, corporate records and other Chinese documents show.
One of the companies, Eagles Men Aviation Science and Technology Group, proclaimed itself "one of the national model businesses of military-civil fusion." Another firm, Guangzhou Tian-Hai-Xiang Aviation Technology, primarily a drone manufacturer, was founded by a former soldier who had fought in China's border war with Vietnam in 1979.
"If you come from the military, you should give back to it," the company's founder and chairman, Li Yuzhuang, has said.
China is far from alone in seeking to harness the dynamism and innovation of commercial businesses to help build a more technologically advanced military. Chinese officials and experts have cited lessons from the Pentagon's partnerships with American companies developing cutting-edge technologies, as well as the role of companies like SpaceX in the American aerospace industry.
But the Communist Party's sweeping power means that its military priorities demand even greater attention, and loyalty, from many Chinese business leaders. Mr. Xi has long sought to develop technological self-sufficiency, and that effort is likely to accelerate in the wake of Washington's expanding restrictions on Chinese access to microchips.
"Given its concern about foreign sanctions and export controls, what we are now seeing is more and more efforts by the Chinese side to try to build up a much more significant civil military fusion system," said Tai Ming Cheung, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, and the author of "Innovate to Dominate: The Rise of the Chinese Techno-Security State." He called these efforts "an important part of this drive for self-reliance in the strategic and defense sectors."
By the time that Mr. Xi came to power in 2012, Chinese leaders had been trying for decades to get civilian industries to work closely with the military. Rivalry between Beijing and Western governments was growing, and homegrown innovation was increasingly important to China's security. But many of China's innovators were in the private sector, and those that sought to do business with the military often encountered distrust and red tape.
Mr. Xi rolled out a vigorous program to press businesses to share their talent and technology. Local governments established funds to support the development of drones, robots and other technologies with military applications. In 2017, Mr. Xi underscored the urgency of the initiative by putting himself in charge of a newly founded national committee to oversee it. It was, he told the committee, "a major step to win a national strategic advantage."
Over three dozen investment funds dedicated to this effort have been founded in China since 2015, with an anticipated ability to disperse a total of more than $ 68.5 billion to firms, according to a 2021 study by Elsa B. Kania and Lorand Laskai at the Center for a New American Security.
In China today there is a complex network of linkages between military applications, commercialization and academic research into emerging technologies, connections that are "hardly coincidental," Ms. Kania said.
Those linkages have in turn raised concerns in Washington that American goods or technologies sold through civilian supply chains could ultimately find military uses. Those fears prompted the Trump administration to cut Huawei off from buying U.S. technologies and prohibit American citizens from investing in the securities of certain companies linked with the Chinese military.
Officials in the Biden administration have also concluded that, at least in certain narrow sectors of the economy, not even commercial ties with China are safe. On Thursday, the Justice and Commerce departments announced that they had set up a new "strike force" in 12 U.S. cities to help prevent advanced technology from being shared with adversaries like China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.
The Biden administration has fortified the country's system of export controls to stop companies from sharing advanced technologies like quantum computing with China. Likewise, the administration's move to place five Chinese companies and a research institute that had supported military airship and balloon programs on a blacklist is aimed at preventing them from purchasing U.S. technology.
The companies have not responded to phone calls seeking comment.
Experts caution that enduring state monopolies in the Chinese defense sector, and a general attitude of distrust toward private business, have meant that China's efforts to bridge the divide between its military and private business is still very much a work in progress.
But some firms have clearly benefited from China's drive to entice private companies to work with the military.
Eagles Men Aviation Science and Technology Group, for example, which was founded by the leading Chinese aeronautics scientist Wu Zhe, sold 16 percent of its shares to three government-backed investment funds focused on military-civil opportunities, according to corporate records.
Eagles Men Aviation had "continuously supplied stealth concealment materials to the Chinese military for 14 years, and its stratospheric airship flight data is at world-leading level," an executive told officials visiting its Beijing headquarters in 2019.
Wu Zhe helped to found another firm facing sanctions, Beijing Nanjiang Aerospace Technology, alongside Shanghai Nanjiang Group, a real estate firm that had also ventured into graphene, intelligent robots and airborne vehicles. Beijing Nanjiang also signed a deal with Xilinhot, a city in northern China, to build a "near-space industrial park" where test flights could be held.
According to tracking by David Asher, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, one of Nanjiang's subsidiaries appears to have sold drones directly to the People's Liberation Army.
Traditionally the Chinese military would have acquired such technology from state-controlled entities, he said. But these links may suggest the P.L.A. is sourcing what were originally commercially developed balloons and drones and "applying them to military missions, including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance."
"Nanjiang Group operates in a manner that is emblematic of a new type of civil-military fusion," Mr. Asher said.
Mr. Wu also helped to set up a venture capital company that invested in a collection of satellite, hydrogen power and aerospace companies with funding from Beihang University, a top military university also under sanctions from the United States, according to documents accessed through Sayari, a commercial risk intelligence platform.
One of these companies, Dongguan Zhonghang Huaxun Satellite Technology, advertised on its website airships installed with monitoring systems, including for military needs, The Wire China previously reported. The website has been taken down.
Even in China, though, these military ties have not been a sure way to riches. By 2019, for example, Shanghai Nanjiang Group's near-space project was foundering financially, and the company announced that it had terminated the program.
The "near-space industrial park" in northern China became caught up in legal disputes over shoddy construction and high costs. A company that Mr. Wu partnered with called Dongfeng Sci-Tech Group delisted from the Shenzhen stock exchange in 2020, after some of its forays into high technology were panned.
While Washington has clearly seized on the risks posed by Chinese corporate-military partnerships, some analysts say the reaction may be going too far. Some have argued that previous characterizations of China as a "whole-of-society threat" contribute to ethnic profiling of Chinese citizens and some Chinese Americans, and deter valuable academic partnerships.
The balloon episode in particular has provoked "a certain sense of hysteria" in the last few weeks, said Christopher K. Johnson, the president of China Strategies Group, and a former senior China analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency.
When the U.S. government cuts off trade with Chinese firms and sectors, there are also costs to U.S. competitiveness, in losing access to revenue and innovation, Mr. Johnson said. "You've just got to be thoughtful about it."

U.S. and China in Growing Diplomatic Crisis Over Spying Programs: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Biden administration is looking into mysterious U.F.O. encounters and pushing back against China over accusations of widespread espionage.
WASHINGTON -- Tensions between the United States and China escalated on Monday as the two nations traded fiery accusations over spying programs, in the aftermath of the U.S. downing of a Chinese spy balloon and three unidentified flying objects a week later over North America.
In a sign of how closely the United States had been monitoring the balloon surveillance program directed by the Chinese military recently, U.S. officials said in interviews that they began tracking the spy balloon as it lifted off from Hainan Island in southern China in late January.
As it drifted over the Aleutian Islands near Alaska and traversed Canada and then Montana, officials said, military leaders alerted President Biden that it was almost certainly the same kind of aerial craft that the U.S. had detected twice by Hawaii, and that it had spotted over Texas and Florida. The balloon was shot down off the coast of South Carolina by a U.S. fighter jet on Feb. 4, and military officials said on Monday that crews had recovered "significant debris" from the craft that included "priority sensor and electronics pieces."
The diplomatic crisis over it has been intensifying. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Wang Wenbin, said Monday in Beijing that the United States ran the "largest spy network in the world," and that it had conducted extensive global surveillance, including capturing electronic communications, that had compromised "the privacy of citizens across the world."
Mr. Wang also said the United States had sent 10 balloons illegally into Chinese airspace since last year, an accusation that prompted an immediate and furious denial from the White House.
Adrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, issued a statement saying "any claim that the U.S. government operates surveillance balloons over the P.R.C. is false," referring to the People's Republic of China.
Ms. Watson pointed to China's spy balloon program and said that Beijing "to this day has failed to offer any credible explanations for its intrusion into our airspace and the airspace of others."
The combative exchange indicates how quickly the espionage programs of the two nations are becoming a revived point of tension in a relationship that is caught in a downward spiral. Mr. Biden and President Xi Jinping of China have sought since a meeting in Bali, Indonesia, in November to stabilize the ties, but the furor set off by the spy balloon has blown up those efforts.
The United States does run extensive espionage programs aimed at China. The collision of a U.S. electronic spy plane and a Chinese fighter jet in 2001, which led to the presumed death of a Chinese pilot, revealed the scope of the American effort to collect electronic communications, though that plane was well off China's coast. The National Security Agency has pierced the networks of China's leading telecommunications company, Huawei, and tracked Chinese soldiers as they moved nuclear weapons.
China has long done the same to the United States, stealing the designs for the F-35 stealth fighter and security clearance files of 22 million Americans from the databases of the Office of Personnel Management.
Yet the message from Washington of the past week is that direct physical intrusions of American and allied airspace are different, and John F. Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said on Monday that he was unaware of any similar U.S. program in Chinese airspace.
If any of the three flying objects destroyed in North America from Friday to Sunday turn out to be Chinese, it would amount to a major provocation on the heels of the spy balloon episode. Several U.S. officials stressed they were not jumping to the conclusion that the objects were Chinese surveillance machines.
Mr. Biden has ordered top national security officials to review how the United States monitors its airspace and whether it needs to change procedures, Mr. Kirby said Monday.
Since the spy balloon episode, the U.S. military has adjusted its radar filters so devices now pick up more objects, he said, and that could account for the spate of sightings that led to the three shootdowns. Several officials said sensor systems are now picking up many signals that are normally automatically filtered out, including migrating flocks of birds and hang gliders.
White House officials were clearly struggling to strike the right balance between showing that they are on heightened alert and not setting off alarms over normal events. And one official said that it was now clear that pilots for NORAD, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, would need revised guidance about when to shoot down objects. Until this weekend, they had rarely fired on any.
"I think we just don't know right now in terms of whether there needs to be threshold changes," Mr. Kirby said.
U.S. agencies are still investigating the origins of the three mysterious objects that U.S. fighter jets shot down between Friday and Sunday on the orders of Mr. Biden and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada. Debris recovery efforts are underway at the sites in Alaska, the Yukon Territory in Canada and the Canadian side of Lake Huron, Mr. Kirby said.
The three objects did not pose a danger to people on the ground, were not sending out communications signals, did not have people inside and did not have maneuvering or propulsion capabilities, he said. They flew at altitudes of between 20,000 feet and 40,000 feet, much lower than the Chinese spy balloon, and they posed a potential risk to civilian air traffic, Mr. Kirby added.
The objects appeared to be pushed by winds, which carried them from west to east, he said.
The object shot down over Lake Huron after it had entered Michigan had an octagonal structure with strings hanging off but had no visible payload, U.S. officials said. They have been careful not to call any of the recent three objects "balloons."
The Biden administration said last week that China had sent surveillance balloons over more than 40 nations on five continents, violating their sovereignty.
A suspected high-altitude Chinese surveillance balloon flew near sensitive U.S. military installations in the Middle East last fall, but it remained far enough offshore that American officials did not deem it a threat and only monitored it as it transited the region, a senior U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational details, said on Monday.
The balloon originated in or near China and traveled westward toward the Middle East -- the opposite direction of prevailing winds and the route taken by the spy balloon that was shot down over the Atlantic Ocean -- suggesting that the machine had its own source of propulsion, the official said.
Military officials in Asia tracked the balloon until it moved west into Middle Eastern air space, where they handed off monitoring duties to military colleagues there, the official said.
The top U.S. Air Force commander in the Middle East, Lt. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, appeared to reference the incident in a meeting with reporters on Monday, citing an encounter in his region last fall involving a high-altitude balloon. He declined to provide details, citing the sensitive nature of the incident.
"It never got to the point where it was a high enough concern," the general said. "We just monitored it."
China has said the balloon shot down by the United States and one spotted over Latin America last week -- which the Pentagon said was also for spying -- were civilian machines used for weather research or test flight purposes.
Mr. Wang, the foreign ministry spokesman, said Monday that it was "common" for American balloons to enter the airspace of other nations illegally, and that U.S. high-altitude balloons had "illegally flown over China's airspace" more than 10 times since last year.
China has a broad definition of its borders -- it makes expansive claims over disputed territories, including around Taiwan, the South China Sea, the East China Sea and the Himalayas -- and it was unclear exactly to what airspace Mr. Wang was referring.
The bulk of America's most important intelligence comes from its network of sophisticated spy satellites, a robust effort to intercept communications electronically, as well as information from human sources. While the C.I.A.'s Chinese spy network was decimated more than a decade ago by Chinese counterintelligence, the United States has been trying to rebuild it.
The United States generally avoids sending reconnaissance devices into the sovereign air space of another country, especially countries like China with sophisticated air defense capabilities. Sending craft that can be easily intercepted risks giving away important capabilities.
Aerial collection is a relatively small part of U.S. intelligence gathering, and for the most part U.S. reconnaissance planes fly in international airspace, just outside the territorial waters of other countries.
While the U.S. has considered developing high-altitude surveillance craft for some counterterrorism or counternarcotics missions, officials have said those methods would do little good in spying on Russia or China because those countries would quickly detect and destroy them, according to former officials.
The United States and China have had many explosive disputes over espionage.
In 2014, a Chinese fighter jet flew within 30 feet of a U.S. Navy surveillance plane in international airspace just off the Chinese coast. The encounter was "very, very close, very dangerous," Mr. Kirby, who was the Pentagon spokesman at the time, had told reporters.
Col. Yang Yujun, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of National Defense, said then that "it is large-scale, high-frequency close-proximity surveillance by the United States that endangers Chinese-U.S. maritime and aviation safety."
By contrast, when China shot down a U.S. spy balloon inside its borders in 1974, both nations handled the episode quietly. China and the United States were rebuilding diplomatic relations after a 23-year break, and the Chinese government kept the incident hidden by labeling it a military secret, according to an article in a magazine managed by the party school of the central committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
With friction growing, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken has not said when he will reschedule a trip to Beijing that he canceled during the spy balloon uproar. He and Wang Yi, China's top foreign policy official, are both expected to attend the annual Munich Security Conference in Germany, which begins Friday. But Ned Price, a State Department spokesman, said Monday that "there's no meeting on the books."

WASHINGTON — Tensions between the United States and China escalated Monday as the two nations traded fiery accusations over spying programs, after the U.S. downing of a Chinese spy balloon and three unidentified flying objects a week later over North America.
In a sign of how closely the United States had been monitoring the balloon surveillance program directed by the Chinese military recently, U.S. officials said in interviews that they began tracking the spy balloon as it lifted off from Hainan Island in southern China in late January.
As it drifted over the Aleutian Islands near Alaska and traversed Canada and then Montana, officials said, military leaders alerted President Joe Biden that it was almost certainly the same kind of aerial craft that the U.S. had detected twice by Hawaii, and that it had spotted over Texas and Florida. The balloon was shot down off the coast of South Carolina by a U.S. fighter jet on Feb. 4, and military officials said Monday that crews had recovered “significant debris” from the craft that included “priority sensor and electronics pieces.”
The diplomatic crisis over it has been intensifying. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, said Monday in Beijing that the United States ran the “largest spy network in the world,” and that it had conducted extensive global surveillance, including capturing electronic communications, that had compromised “the privacy of citizens across the world.”
Wang also said the United States had sent 10 balloons illegally into Chinese airspace since last year, an accusation that prompted an immediate and furious denial from the White House.
Adrienne Watson, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, issued a statement saying “any claim that the U.S. government operates surveillance balloons over the PRC is false,” referring to the People’s Republic of China.
Watson pointed to China’s spy balloon program and said that Beijing “to this day has failed to offer any credible explanations for its intrusion into our airspace and the airspace of others.”
The combative exchange indicates how quickly the espionage programs of the two nations are becoming a revived point of tension in a relationship that is caught in a downward spiral. Biden and President Xi Jinping of China have sought since a meeting in Bali, Indonesia, in November to stabilize the ties, but the furor set off by the spy balloon has blown up those efforts.

U.S. Is Aiming to Curtail Tech Investments in China: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Biden administration is preparing new rules that would restrict U.S. dollars from flowing to China.
WASHINGTON -- Growing concerns about China's military and economic ambitions have lawmakers and the White House weighing yet another effort to restrict Beijing's access to advanced technologies that could be used in war.
This time, the U.S. government appears poised to extend its restrictions to a new area: American dollars that are used to finance the development of such technologies within Chinese borders.
For months, the Biden administration has been preparing curbs on the investments that U.S. firms can make in China, particularly in areas like advanced computing.
Those measures are now largely complete and could be issued within two months. The Treasury Department has been reaching out to other governments, including the European Union, to try to ensure that they do not rush in to provide similar financing to China after the United States cuts it off, according to people familiar with the discussions.
The voyage of a spy balloon across the United States has set off newfound fears about the national security threats posed by the Chinese government. This week, lawmakers on both sides warned the White House that if the administration did not move ahead with investment restrictions, Congress would propose its own.
At a hearing on Tuesday aimed at publicizing the security threat from China, Representative Blaine Luetkemeyer, Republican of Missouri, said it was the "committee's job to examine all interconnections between the Chinese and U.S. economy, specifically connections supporting China's military and human rights abuses, and pursue options to eliminate U.S. capital flowing into those areas."
Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, said the United States needed to make sure that "hedge funds, private equity firms and Wall Street are not investing in ways that hurt our economy or funding the adversarial actions of the Chinese government."
Members of the Biden administration spent much of last year weighing how broadly to apply investment restrictions, with officials reaching out to business executives to get their views on the impact that such a move might have.
Details of the pending executive order remain unclear, but it is expected to require companies to report more information to the government about their planned investments in certain adversarial countries. Several people familiar with the plans said the order would most likely prohibit outright investments in some sensitive areas, like quantum computing, advanced semiconductors and certain artificial intelligence capabilities with military or surveillance applications.
U.S. officials have also increasingly been concerned about China's use of biotechnology, but several people said the administration had decided to exclude the sector, at least initially.
Supporters of investment restrictions say they would help fill in a significant hole in the economic barriers that the United States is setting up with China. The government already prohibits U.S. companies from directly selling certain advanced technologies to China, and it has long monitored the investments that Chinese companies make in the United States for potential security risks.
But the government has little control over or insight into money traveling from the United States to China, said Claire Chu, a senior China analyst at Janes, a defense intelligence firm. Support has been building for the government to take more oversight of these kinds of deals, she said.
"It's not so much a matter of whether this will happen as when," Ms. Chu said.
Some of the proposals have prompted resistance from industry groups, which argued that overly broad restrictions could overwhelm government officials in charge of oversight, creating big delays, and ricochet back on the U.S. economy, harming its competitiveness.
A broader proposal in Congress last year to review outbound investments in critical sectors including infrastructure and medicine prompted pushback from groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the U.S.-China Business Council.
"Industry is kind of united: We don't want this," said Antonia Tzinova, a partner at the law firm Holland & Knight who specializes in national security reviews of investments into the United States.
The Biden administration's plan appears to be much more narrowly targeted at a few sensitive sectors. But some industry representatives remain concerned that measures that apply only to U.S. firms, and not their foreign competitors, could put American businesses at a disadvantage.
Others say that China has access to plenty of other sources of funding worldwide, and that cutting off access would prevent U.S. companies from benefiting from Chinese innovations.
"Getting the details right on outbound investment screening is easier said than done," said Rory Murphy, the vice president of government affairs for the U.S.-China Business Council. "These are technical and complicated sectors, and the details are critical."
He added that his group wanted to "help policymakers thread the needle of achieving their national security objectives while not going too broad and putting U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage."
Investment firms including Blackstone, KKR, Sequoia, Carlyle Group, Bain Capital, Silver Lake, General Atlantic and Warburg Pincus all have notable exposure to China. According to tracking by Rhodium Group, a research firm with a focus on China, U.S. investors have been carrying out about 3,000 transactions per year in China, including both foreign direct investment and venture capital deals, with about 500 of those valued at more than $ 1 million.
Bill Ford, the chief executive of General Atlantic, an investment firm, has expressed his views about possible regulation directly with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, a person familiar with the matter said.
General Atlantic says it has invested nearly $ 7 billion in China since 2000 with more than 34 portfolio companies in the country. One of its highest-profile investments there, ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, has found itself in the cross hairs of the debate over how to manage U.S.-Chinese financial ties.
Depending on how it is put into effect, this new tool could fundamentally alter the country's financial relationship with China, one of America's largest trading partners but also a primary geopolitical rival.
U.S. companies spent about $ 11 billion in 2022 buying or investing in Chinese companies, according to the data service firm Dealogic. While that is a small slice of the more than $ 1.5 trillion that U.S. companies invested globally that year, China deals are still considered valuable because they may provide venture firms access to innovation and, possibly, their next big win.
Venture firms, which seed earlier-stage companies, have been particularly active in the region. According to data compiled by Pitchbook, for example, the investment firm GGV Capital did 105 deals from 2021 to 2022; GSR Ventures did 95. Other notable names on the list include Tiger Global Management, which did 27 deals in the same period. Intel's venture capital firm did 17 deals in the same period, while Qualcomm's venture arm did 16.
Until very recently, the U.S. government's role was to try to expand financial ties with China. For example, greater access for American financial services firms was one major part of the trade deal that President Donald J. Trump reached with Chinese officials in 2020.
At a White House ceremony where he signed the deal into law, Mr. Trump name-checked executives from Citadel, Carlyle, Goldman Sachs and Blackstone, some of whom had become unofficial back channels with the Chinese government during negotiations for a trade pact that could prove lucrative to their businesses.
"Steve, I know you have no interest in this deal at all," Mr. Trump said sarcastically to Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of Blackstone Group, who was seated in the audience at the White House. "I'm surprised you're not actually sitting over here on the ledge of the stage."
Since that trade deal was signed, U.S. attitudes toward China have turned even more negative and suspicious. The Chinese government has embraced a system of techno-authoritarianism that has used U.S. technologies to surveil dissidents in China and abroad. It has also become clear that some private Chinese tech firms have fed into Beijing's efforts to develop military technologies, like hypersonic missiles.
The Biden administration has steadily placed more restrictions on selling advanced technology to China, expanding the initial restrictions that Mr. Trump issued against Chinese firms like Huawei.
It remains to be seen whether the administration's planned restrictions will mollify lawmakers who are calling for tough restrictions, or prompt Congress to propose more draconian measures.
Lawmakers previously considered imposing broader restrictions as part of a bill aimed at building up American semiconductor manufacturing that passed last year. But those measures were stripped out of the final legislation, partly because of how expansive they were.
In September, a group of top lawmakers sent a letter to the Biden administration urging it to take action to review investments in adversarial countries like China.
In a government spending bill that President Biden signed late last year, Congress included $ 20 million for the Commerce and Treasury Departments to begin to set up teams to review such investments. It also instructed them to submit a joint report by later this month describing the potential program and the resources it would need.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: There is nothing new about superpowers spying on one another, even from balloons. But for pure gall, there was something different this time.
It may be months before American intelligence agencies can compare the audacious flight of a Chinese surveillance balloon across the country to other intrusions on America's national security systems, to determine how it ranks.
After all, there is plenty of competition.
There was the theft of the designs of the F-35 about 15 years ago, enabling the Chinese air force to develop its own look-alike stealth fighter, with Chinese characteristics. There was the case of China's premier hacking team lifting the security clearance files for 22 million Americans from the barely secured computers of the Office of Personnel Management in 2015. That, combined with stolen medical files from Anthem and travel records from Marriott hotels, has presumably helped the Chinese create a detailed blueprint of America's national security infrastructure.
But for pure gall, there was something different about the balloon. It became the subject of public fascination as it floated over nuclear silos of Montana, then was spotted near Kansas City and met its cinematic end when a Sidewinder missile took it down over shallow waters off the coast of South Carolina. Not surprisingly, now it is coveted by military and intelligence officials who desperately want to reverse-engineer whatever remains the Coast Guard and the Navy can recover.
Yet beyond the made-for-cable-news spectacle, the entire incident also speaks volumes about how little Washington and Beijing communicate, almost 22 years after the collision of an American spy plane and a Chinese fighter about 70 miles off the coast of Hainan Island led both sides to vow that they would improve their crisis management.
"We don't know what the intelligence yield was for the Chinese," said Evan Medeiros, a Georgetown professor who advised President Barack Obama on China and Asia with the National Security Council. "But there is no doubt it was a gross violation of sovereignty," something the Chinese object to vociferously when the United States flies over and sails through the islands China has built from sandbars in the South China Sea.
"And this made visceral the China challenge," Mr. Medeiros said, "to look up when you are out walking your dog, and you see a Chinese spy balloon in the sky."
As it turns out, it was hardly the first time. Hours before the giant balloon met its deflated end, the Pentagon said there was another one in flight, over South America. And it noted a long history of Chinese balloons flying over the United States (which the Pentagon, somehow, never wanted to talk about before, until this incident forced it to).
"Instances of this kind of balloon activity have been observed previously over the past several years," the Pentagon spokesman, Brig. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder, said in a statement published on Thursday. One senior official said many of those were in the Pacific, some near Hawaii, where the Indo-Pacific Command is based, along with much of the naval capability and surveillance gear of the Pacific Fleet.
General Ryder's admission raises the question of whether the United States failed to set a red line years ago about the balloon surveillance, essentially encouraging China to grow bolder and bolder. "The fact that they have come into airspace before is not comforting," said Amy B. Zegart, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author of "Spies, Lies and Algorithms," a study of new technologies in ubiquitous surveillance. "We should have had a strategy earlier," she said, and "we should have signaled our limits much earlier."
Of course, there is nothing new about superpowers spying on one another, even from balloons. President Dwight D. Eisenhower authorized surveillance of the Soviet Union by lofting cameras on balloons in the mid-1950s, flying them "over Soviet bloc countries under the guise of meteorological research," according to an article published by the National Archives in 2009. It "yielded more protests from the Kremlin than it did useful intelligence," the author, David Haight, an archivist at the Eisenhower Library, reported.
With the advent of the first spy satellites, the balloons appeared to become obsolete.
Now they are making a comeback, because while spy satellites can see almost everything, balloons equipped with high-tech sensors hover over a site far longer and can pick up radio, cellular and other transmissions that cannot be detected from space. That is why the Montana sighting of the balloon was critical; in recent years, the National Security Agency and United States Strategic Command, which oversees the American nuclear arsenal, have been remaking communications with nuclear weapons sites. That would be one, but only one, of the natural targets for China's Ministry of State Security, which oversees many of its national security hacks.
The N.S.A. also targets China, of course. From the revelations of Edward Snowden, the former contractor who revealed many of the agency's operations a decade ago, the world learned that the United States broke into the networks of Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications firm, and also tracked the movements of Chinese leaders and soldiers responsible for moving Chinese nuclear weapons. That is only a small sliver of American surveillance in China.
Such activities add to China's argument that everyone does it. Because they are largely hidden -- save for the occasional revelation of a big hack -- they have rarely become wrapped in national politics. That is changing.
The balloon incident came at a moment when Democrats and Republicans are competing to demonstrate who can be stronger on China. And that showed: The new chairman of the House intelligence committee, Representative Michael R. Turner, an Ohio Republican, echoed the many Republicans who argued the balloon needed to come down sooner.
He called the shoot-down "sort of like tackling the quarterback after the game is over. The satellite had completed its mission. It should never have been allowed to enter the United States, and it never should have been allowed to complete its mission."
It is not yet clear what that "mission" was, or whether the risk of letting it proceed truly outweighed the risk of taking the balloon down over land, as Mr. Turner seemed to imply. It is only a small part of the increasingly aggressive "Spy vs. Spy" moves of superpower competitors. That has only intensified as control of semiconductor production equipment, artificial intelligence tools, 5G telecommunications, quantum computing and biological sciences has become the source of new arms races. And both sides play.
Yet it was the obviousness of the balloon that made many in Washington wonder whether the intelligence community and the civilian leadership in Beijing are communicating with each other.
"Whatever the value of what the Chinese might have obtained," said Gen. Michael Rogers, the former director of the National Security Agency during the Obama and Trump administrations, "what was different here was the visibility. It just has a different feel when it is a physical intrusion on the country." And once it was detected, China "handled it badly," he said.
The balloon drifted over the continental United States just days before Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken was supposed to make the first visit of a top American diplomat to Beijing in many years. Chinese officials maintained that it was a weather balloon that had entered U.S. airspace by accident.
Mr. Blinken canceled his trip -- a public slap that many American officials believe President Xi Jinping cannot be happy about, at a moment the Chinese leader appears to be trying to stabilize the fast-descending relationship with Washington.
This was hardly a life-threatening crisis. But the fact that Chinese officials, realizing that the balloon had been spotted, did not call to work out a way to deal with it was revealing.
That kind of problem was supposed to be resolved after the 2001 collision of an EP-3 spy plane and a Chinese fighter that brought down both planes. For days after that incident, President George W. Bush could not get Chinese leaders on the phone. Efforts by the secretary of state at the time, Gen. Colin Powell, also failed. "It made you wonder what might happen in a deeper crisis," General Powell said later.
Afterward, hotlines were set up, and promises made about better communications. Clearly, those failed. When the balloon was shot down, China issued a statement saying "for the United States to insist on using armed forces is clearly an excessive reaction."
Few experts doubt that had the situation been reversed, China would have used force -- it has threatened to do that when it believed outsiders were entering disputed waters, much less established Chinese territory.
"It makes you wonder who was talking to whom in China," Ms. Zegart said. "This is clearly the greatest unforced error the Chinese have made in some time."

A Ban on TikTok Won't Make Us More Secure: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A ban of TikTok throughout the United States, if it could actually be enacted, would immediately solve our national security concerns about the wildly popular Chinese-owned video app. But such a ban might ultimately put our national security at greater risk. Moreover, it would sidestep a broader problem -- our nation's overall failure to address concerns over the huge amount of personal data collected in our digital lives, especially when that data could be used by foreign adversaries.
When it comes to its own citizens, China has prohibited everything from Google to Twitter to this newspaper. Rather than viewing that asymmetry as unfair, we should recognize its symbolic value: America wins when it can show the world that it's an open and democratic country. Not surprisingly, banning TikTok on the grounds that it's a threat to our security won't be seen by other nations as much different from the People's Republic of China's actions to protect itself. It's also not certain that the federal government can, under the First Amendment, simply prohibit access to a significant communications platform or that it can control online content so as to preclude disinformation. And then there's the political question of whether TikTok's estimated 100 million American fans will allow it to be taken away from them.
The case against TikTok isn't hard to make. The heads of the F.B.I. and our spy agencies fear that the Chinese government will force TikTok's owner, ByteDance, to hand over the extensive personal information of the app's American users or demand that it push disinformation.
In fact, China's 2017 National Intelligence Law requires Chinese companies to furnish any customer information relevant to China's national security. TikTok collects astonishing amounts of user information, more than some other popular social media apps. There's no evidence that ByteDance has ever turned over this information to the Chinese government. Yet in an episode that revealed the possibility of future government interference, ByteDance admitted in December that it had fired some China- and U.S.-based employees for wrongfully snooping on Americans' private information, including that of journalists, collected through TikTok.
Although it hasn't happened yet, it's easy to see how China could commandeer the powerfully influential app to affect elections or manipulate public opinion, with especially pernicious effects in a time of crisis. Two out of three American teenagers have used TikTok, so disinformation on the app could be particularly potent for that impressionable audience. There's no better evidence of why a government might fear the app's insidious nature than the fact that TikTok is banned in China itself. Instead, the Chinese government lets ByteDance use a limited domestic version of the app that's explicitly subject to state censorship.
Were American users' personal data to be given to the Chinese government, or if the app were to spew Chinese disinformation, it would be almost impossible to undo the harm. So it's no surprise that following congressional hearings on the risks, the federal government banned TikTok from government-owned phones and computers, and many states have done the same. That hardly solves the problem, since there's no ban on using TikTok on an individual's personal devices. Yet legislation pending in Congress would effectively do just that, nationwide. Moreover, if it wanted to collect information on Americans, China could sidestep a ban and legally, though with a little more effort, purchase almost limitless amounts of information from data brokers who stockpile information about our online activities.
If we had comprehensive laws that limit the collection and misuse (including the potential export to China) of Americans' online personal data, then fears about the Chinese authorities using the app for surveillance and data collection would be greatly reduced. The freewheeling data broker business would also be restricted, so all that data would no longer be readily available. After years of debate, Congress came tantalizingly close last year to adopting basic data privacy legislation. In the meantime, several states have moved ahead with their own privacy laws -- hardly an efficient solution to a national and transnational problem. As if to illustrate the point, Indiana recently sued TikTok, claiming it violates state consumer protection laws. No one's figured out how to operate a social media app with different rules for each state.
Either way, through new privacy laws or imposing a full national ban that passes constitutional muster, Congress will have to act. Federal law governing foreign investment has historically been focused on national security concerns such as ownership of defense industry contractors, not on attributes of the digital age, such as social media apps. Indeed, President Donald Trump tried to ban TikTok under a 1977 statute, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, but TikTok successfully argued in court that the law didn't cover the platform.
The recent limited bans on TikTok are mostly an effective way for politicians to sound tough on China. The House of Representatives has just established a select committee to investigate the strategic challenges posed by China to America's economy generally and especially to its tech industry. There's no dispute that China represents a genuine threat in many ways -- but the danger is that political winds will push us to do something bold about TikTok without thinking through the long-term consequences.
President Biden's national security team has been negotiating with TikTok over an arrangement that would require U.S. users' data to be kept in servers in this country, subject to a three-person board of overseers to ensure that data isn't siphoned off to China and to prevent China from censoring or manipulating information on the platform. It's not clear whether the complicated, long-running negotiations, handled by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, will succeed, but TikTok has recently shown willingness to disclose its content algorithms, which could remove one of the stumbling blocks.
But if U.S. negotiations with TikTok aren't successful and we don't have data privacy laws to prevent the problem in the first place, why not a complete ban of TikTok in the United States? Because of the highly visible nature of TikTok, the substantive consequences of a ban would be far more important than the symbolic ones. Prohibiting TikTok would set on evermore divergent paths the two nations that have the greatest power to affect the world order. There has, of course, been endless debate over the wisdom of decoupling the U.S. and Chinese economies and the concomitant rise of separate and dueling Chinese and Western technology systems. For the United States, decoupling has included curtailing Chinese surveillance technology -- restricting, for example, Huawei telecommunications equipment and DJI drones. That arguably makes sense where the risk can't be mitigated or controlled and prohibition is the only practical solution.
But we haven't taken the step of evicting Chinese social media. Given the app's use by about a third of the U.S. population and its association with the everyday expression of political and personal views, outlawing TikTok would constitute a disproportionately greater move toward decoupling and might invite retaliation -- as compared with outlawing commercial hardware containing surveillance-capable chips.
Keeping Chinese enterprises invested in the U.S. economy and its technology pays indirect but powerful geopolitical dividends in the form of dampening China's willingness to antagonize the United States. President Xi Jinping would surely think twice before taking action that would jeopardize the 17 percent of his country's trade that goes to the United States or its almost trillion-dollar holdings of U.S. government debt (only Japan has more). In assessing incremental risks of Chinese technology, we need to think carefully about the cumulative long-term implications, since each step potentially both emboldens and further isolates China, thus jeopardizing our national security in more profound ways.
Such a calculation doesn't mean we should shortchange security concerns about Chinese surveillance and disinformation. We have some maneuvering room to protect ourselves from a potentially dangerous app while still enhancing long-term national security. The optimal way forward would be for Congress to pass a law governing the collection and misuse of online personal and commercial data that would apply not only to current apps such as TikTok but also to future digital apps (foreign owned or not) posing security or privacy concerns.
Without such congressional action, the next best outcome would be for ByteDance, recognizing that the status quo is untenable, to sell the app to an American company. ByteDance has resisted that, so the more likely resolution will be an arrangement approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to oversee the app, with American executives controlling content and user data. If neither is possible, only then should we resort to an outright TikTok ban -- recognizing that choosing an expedient, simple solution for one national security problem might generate a more complex and enduring one.

What Happens to a Poor, Forgotten Nation When China Rushes In

HONIARA, Solomon Islands — Down a dirt road outside the Solomon Islands’ capital city, past Chinese construction projects and shops where Chinese merchants sell snacks, a tribal chief tried to explain what it feels like to have a rising superpower suddenly take an interest in a poor, forgotten place desperate for development.
“At first,” the chief, Peter Kosemu, 50, said as he sat in the shade on Guadalcanal, the largest of the Solomon Islands, “most people just wanted to see what was going on.”
He and many others have watched China rush headlong into seemingly every corner of the economy and politics of this South Pacific nation over the past three years, spurring fears in the West that Beijing is trying to set up an outpost that could play a strategic role in any future conflict with the United States and its allies.
China has opened a large embassy, started construction on a stadium complex and signed secretive deals with the government on security, aviation, telecommunications and more. Many islanders liken it to seeing carpenters waltz unannounced into your kitchen, drawing up plans, tearing down and building, with little explanation.
The longer it has gone on, the more curiosity about China’s big spending and lending has given way to concern and a simmering anger that comes from asking questions never answered. Workers at the stadium — including many who commute from where Kosemu lives — complain about unfulfilled promises on pay. Residents fret that the prime minister and Chinese officials are undermining democracy, as politicians who resisted China’s plans, or just asked tough questions, have reported that their rivals are suddenly flush with money and pro-China messages that the public is expected to simply accept.
“There’s no proper consultation with the people,” Kosemu said. “No one is happy about it.”
For years, Beijing has thrown its wealth across the globe to fuel its economy, gain geopolitical influence and blunt criticism. The Solomon Islands has been portrayed by Chinese state media as a model of what China’s international efforts can accomplish, suggesting an unstoppable march toward dominance by America’s main competitor.
“Chinese modernization offers humanity a new choice,” China’s leader, Xi Jinping, said at the Communist Party congress in late October, when he secured a third term and was beginning to reengage China with the world after a COVID-19 hiatus.
But in the Solomons, a nation of about 700,000 people and around 1,000 islands in the sea lanes between Australia and the United States, recent experience suggests there is a cost to Beijing’s confident, money-driven approach to expanding its power around the globe.
For many islanders, China is productive, yes, and attentive, but they see it less as a benign partner than as an imperious and corrupting force that raises the risk of conflict.
Anti-government riots led to the torching of Chinese businesses in November 2021. Among the protesters’ main concerns was the way that China’s influence seemed to tilt economic opportunity to politicians and places that were more willing to do Beijing’s bidding.
The government has shown no sign of changing course. In September, the Solomons delayed its 2023 national election, declaring it lacked the capacity to host in the same year both a vote and the Pacific Games, which will take place at the new stadium. As it has embraced Chinese technological infrastructure, the government has also taken on debt that the World Bank recently described as unsustainable.
Some U.S. officials worry that China’s goal in the Solomons is to create a client state, securing deepwater ports and satellite communication sites. The country’s prime minister signed a security deal in April that gives China a right to send police officers or naval vessels to the country with few limitations.
As Beijing’s priorities have shifted from development to defense, fears of its strong-arm tactics are increasing. Surveys show negative views of China are soaring worldwide.
“China is much less successful than is commonly assumed,” said Audrye Wong, a political scientist at the University of Southern California. “They think paying off people is a quicker and more efficient way of achieving the things the Chinese government wants. The reality is it often creates a backlash and doesn’t work.”
‘They Don’t Understand Us’
Every evening just before 6 p.m., workers stream out of the stadium complex in the capital, Honiara, that is being built by a Chinese state-owned company with what officials have described as a generous $50 million grant from the Chinese government.
Signs out front boast of friendship, cooperation and safety in Chinese and English. But after work recently, at a food stand across the street, employees called all of that a lie.
“Everyone wants to strike because of the poor payment and lack of safety,” said Lenny Olea, 35, a driver. “We need to get this fixed.”
Olea said he was making $1.20 an hour less than what he used to make at a hotel after promises of extra money for food and transportation never materialized. A dozen others said that they had received no safety training and that their Chinese foremen communicated with sign language and hit them in the head if they got something wrong.
“They don’t understand us,” Olea said.
The Chinese Embassy denied a request by The New York Times to speak with the ambassador. The Chinese company, China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation, did not respond to emailed questions about the workers’ complaints.
Since the government of Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare switched allegiance from Taiwan in 2019, saying it would aid the country’s development, more Chinese companies have set up in the Solomons. Islanders tell stories of warm interactions with Chinese merchants who migrated decades ago. But many complain that newer arrivals treat workers (and customers) like peons — owners often ring up sales from a platform that lets them tower over all who enter.
Some provincial leaders have resisted Chinese investment.
The premier of Malaita province, Daniel Suidani, explained that he had welcomed projects from Japan and other countries but blocked attempts by China to do infrastructure work because he had not seen it add value elsewhere in the country. He said Chinese officials had worked with politicians in Parliament seeking to undermine him, funneling aid to their districts, rather than asking him about what the province needed.
“So far, the truth is no one has come,” he said.
That lack of consultation remains a source of frustration across the country.
The Solomons’ Indigenous roots include an abiding respect for dialogue. A broad conversation with the community is often required before major decisions are made.
China has operated with a more top-down approach.
“What we have seen with the presence of China are pushy advisers,” said Celsius Talifilu, who worked for Sogavare until late 2019 and now works for Suidani.
In places such as Burns Creek, where about 10,000 people — many from Malaita — have built homes in a grassy flood plain, the lack of transparency has fueled a slow gas leak of resentment.
“People stay quiet in this country until it reaches a climax they can’t accept,” said Joe Kelesi, 39, an elder at the Bethlehem Worship Center. “Until something sparks their disappointment.”
‘This Is State Capture’
Outside the Chinese Embassy, posters show splashy renderings of future projects and photos of Sogavare with Chinese officials. It has the feel of a movie theater marquee, with Sogavare as the star.
Volatile and charming, he has grown more defensive as he has become more intertwined with Chinese projects. He has told reporters there will be no Chinese military bases in the country, but after watching Chinese police train with Solomon Islands officers for the first time, he declared: “I feel safer.”
Leaked documents point to how the security agreement may have come together. Meeting minutes from the Sogavare government showed that, in August 2021, money from the Chinese government went to 39 of 50 members of Parliament from a “national development fund” previously financed by Taiwan — about $25,000 each.
A signed letter from Sogavare, 67, explained that the money had come from the Chinese Embassy.
Internal memos seen by The Times also identify another set of slightly larger Chinese payments that followed the unrest in November 2021, directed to those who had voted to keep Sogavare from losing a no-confidence vote.
Three months later, a draft of the security deal emerged.
In August, Sogavare also announced that a Chinese state-owned company, China Harbor Engineering Company, would build 161 cellular towers from Huawei, another Chinese company, with a $70 million loan from the Chinese government.
China Harbor’s offices are in the same green building as the Solomons’ Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Neither responded to requests for comment, nor did Sogavare’s office.
Opposition leaders accuse China of encouraging the election delay and mounting what they say has been a bribery campaign to keep allies in power. According to civil society groups, Chinese money has been used to buy laptops for Chinese propaganda videos displayed at community gatherings.
Peter Kenilorea Jr., deputy opposition leader, said two government officials had recently offered nearly $2 million to one of his father’s cousins to run against him; a little over a year ago, he added, another relative had been asked to run for about $750,000.
The dollar amounts were far above what he believed would be possible without Chinese cash.
And China continues to spend and give. A few months ago, the Chinese ambassador gave a new pickup truck with “China Aid” painted on the side to a small hospital’s psychiatric unit.
Matthew Wale, the opposition leader, said, “This is state capture, happening in real life.”
The United States and Australia have tried to counter Chinese influence. Australia will give more than $100 million in aid to the Solomon Islands this fiscal year. American military doctors also recently performed free surgeries alongside local doctors on a U.S. hospital ship in Honiara’s harbor.
“China never does this kind of thing,” Dr. Catherine Tirri, 40, said as she observed a fistula surgery. “China doesn’t do service.”
A more skeptical question followed: Would there be any American follow-up? A plan to reopen a long-closed embassy has been caught up in red tape, limiting the U.S. presence to three diplomats (and a dog) living and working out of hotel rooms, with an interim embassy scheduled to open later this year.
In the meantime, Kosemu, the tribal chief, said frustration with China and its proxies keeps intensifying.
“The people have had enough of making requests to the government and being ignored,” he said. “Protests may be the only way to make them listen.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

HONIARA, Solomon Islands — Down a dirt road outside the Solomon Islands’ capital city, past Chinese construction projects and shops where Chinese merchants sell snacks and clothes, a tribal chief tried to explain what it feels like to have a rising superpower suddenly take an interest in a poor, forgotten place.
“At first,” said the chief, Peter Kosemu, 50, as he sat in the shade on Guadalcanal, the largest of the Solomon Islands, “most people just wanted to see what was going on.”
When the Solomons cut ties with Taiwan in 2019, China rushed in, opening a large embassy, breaking ground on a stadium complex for this year’s Pacific Games, and signing secretive deals with the government on security, aviation, telecommunications and more. Many islanders likened it to watching carpenters waltz unannounced into your kitchen, drawing up plans, tearing down and building, with little explanation.
But what started as curiosity has turned, for many, into a source of deep concern, raising questions about China’s you-should-be-grateful approach to the developing world. Workers at the stadium — including many who commute from wood-slat houses in the area where Kosemu lives — complain about unfulfilled promises on pay. Politicians who resisted China’s plans, or just asked tough questions, have reported that their rivals are suddenly flush with money and pro-China messages. Community leaders regularly hear neighbors condemn the prime minister and Chinese officials for undermining democracy.
“There’s no proper consultation with the people,” Kosemu said. “No one is happy about it.”
For years, Beijing has thrown its wealth and weight across the globe to fuel its economy, gain geopolitical influence and blunt criticism. The Solomon Islands has often been portrayed by Chinese state media as a model of what China’s international efforts can accomplish, suggesting an unstoppable march toward dominance by America’s main competitor.
“Chinese modernization offers humanity a new choice,” China’s leader, Xi Jinping, said in late October at the Communist Party congress in Beijing, when he secured a third term and was beginning to reengage China with the world after a COVID-19 hiatus.
But in the Solomons, a country of about 700,000 people and 1,000 islands that sit in the sea lanes between Australia and the United States, recent experience undercuts Beijing’s confident, money-driven approach to expanding its power around the globe.
For many islanders, China is productive, yes, and attentive, but they see it less as a benign partner than as an imperious and corrupting force that raises the risk of conflict.
Anti-government riots led to the burning of Chinese businesses in November 2021. Among the protesters’ main concerns was the way that China’s influence seemed to tilt economic opportunity to politicians and places that were more willing to do Beijing’s bidding.
The government has shown no sign of changing course. In September, the Solomons delayed its 2023 national election, declaring it lacked the capacity to host both an election and the Pacific Games in the same year. As it has embraced Chinese technological infrastructure, the government has also taken on debt that the World Bank recently described as unsustainable.
Some U.S. officials worry that China’s goal in the Solomons is to create a client state, securing deep water ports and satellite communication sites that could surveil or stymie military operations by Australia and the United States in the event of a war over Taiwan. The country’s prime minister signed a security deal in April that gives China a right to send police officers or naval vessels to the country with few limitations.
Because of strong-arm tactics such as these, surveys show, negative views of China are soaring around the world.
“China is much less successful than is commonly assumed,” said Audrye Wong, a political scientist at the University of Southern California who focuses on Chinese foreign policy. “They think paying off people is a quicker and more efficient way of achieving the things the Chinese government wants. The reality is it often creates a backlash and doesn’t work.”
‘They Don’t Understand Us’
Every day just before 6 p.m., workers stream out of the stadium complex in the capital, Honiara, that is being built by a Chinese state-owned company with what officials have described as a generous $50 million grant from the Chinese government.
The signs out front boast of friendship, cooperation and safety in Chinese and English. But after work recently, at a snack stand across the street, employees called all of that a lie.
“Everyone wants to strike because of the poor payment and lack of safety,” said Lenny Olea, 35, a driver. “We need to get this fixed.”
Olea said he was making $1.20 an hour less than what he used to make at a hotel after promises of extra money for food and transportation never materialized. A dozen others said that they had received no safety training and that their Chinese foremen communicated with sign language and hit them in the head if they got something wrong.
“They don’t understand us,” Olea said.
The Chinese Embassy denied a request by The New York Times to speak with the ambassador. The Chinese company, China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation, did not respond to emailed questions about the workers’ complaints.
Since the government of Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare switched allegiance to Beijing, more Chinese companies have set up in the Solomons, buying everything from mines to grocery stores and gas stations. Islanders often tell stories of warm interactions with Chinese merchants who migrated decades ago. But many complain that newer arrivals treat workers (and customers) like peons — owners often ring up sales from a platform that lets them tower over all who enter.
Seeing such tensions, some provincial leaders have resisted Chinese investment.
In an interview at his office, the premier of Malaita province, Daniel Suidani, explained that he had welcomed projects from Japan and other countries but blocked attempts by China to do infrastructure work because he had not seen it add any real value elsewhere in the country. He said Chinese officials had worked with politicians in Parliament seeking to undermine him, funneling aid to their districts, rather than asking him about what the province needed.
“I’m not stopping them, to come and have a good call here or a talk with me,” he added. “But so far, the truth is no one has come.”
That lack of consultation remains a source of frustration across the country.
The Solomons’ Indigenous roots include an abiding respect for dialogue. A broad conversation with the community, sometimes called “outim talk talk” in the local language, is often required before major decisions are made.
China has operated with a more top-down approach. Sogavare said in August 2019 that his government would consult with the whole country as he considered whether to switch the country’s allegiance to China. A few days later, he announced the decision.
“What we have seen with the presence of China are pushy advisers,” said Celsius Talifilu, who worked for Sogavare until late 2019 and now works for Suidani.
In places such as Burns Creek, where about 10,000 people — many from Malaita — have built homes in a grassy flood plain, the lack of transparency has come to be seen as disrespect, fueling a low-level anger, as invisible and present as a slow gas leak.
“People stay quiet in this country until it reaches a climax they can’t accept,” said Joe Kelesi, 39, an elder at the Bethlehem Worship Center. “Until something sparks their disappointment.”
‘This Is State Capture’
Outside the Chinese Embassy, posters show splashy renderings of future projects and photos of Sogavare with Chinese officials. It all has the feel of a movie theater marquee, with Sogavare as the star.
A black belt in karate, known for being charming and volatile, he has grown more combative as he has become more intertwined with Chinese projects and pressures. After watching Chinese police officers train with Solomon Islands officers for the first time, he declared, “I feel safer.”
Leaked documents point to how the security agreement may have come together. Meeting minutes from the Sogavare government showed that, in August 2021, as public criticism of Sogavare’s coziness with China intensified, money from the Chinese government went to 39 of 50 members of Parliament from a “national development fund” — about $25,000 each.
A signed letter from Sogavare, 67, explained that the money had come from the Chinese Embassy, which “has been consulted on this additional support and have consented to the release of this assistance.”
Internal memos seen by the Times also identify another set of slightly larger Chinese payments that followed the unrest in November 2021, directed to those who had voted to keep Sogavare from losing a no-confidence vote.
Three months later, a draft of the security deal emerged.
In August, Sogavare also announced that a Chinese state-owned company, China Harbor Engineering Company, would build 161 cellular towers from Huawei, another Chinese company, with a $70 million loan from the Chinese government.
China Harbor’s offices are in the same green building as the Solomons’ Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Neither responded to requests for comment, nor did Sogavare’s office.
Opposition leaders accuse China of expanding a bribery campaign to keep allies in power. According to civil society groups, Chinese money has been used to buy laptops for Chinese propaganda videos displayed at community gatherings and, in some cases, to pay voters more than a week’s wages for showing up at events.
Peter Kenilorea Jr., deputy opposition leader, said two government officials had recently offered nearly $2 million to one of his father’s cousins to run against him; a little over a year ago, he added, another relative had been asked to run for about $750,000.
The dollar amounts were far above what he believed would be possible without Chinese cash.
And China continues to spend and give. A hospital in east Malaita recently received construction materials from Chinese officials. A few months ago, the Chinese ambassador gave a new pickup truck with “China Aid” painted on the side to a small hospital’s psychiatric unit.
Matthew Wale, the opposition leader, said, “This is state capture, happening in real life.”
The United States and Australia have tried to counter Chinese influence. Australia will give more than $100 million in aid to the Solomon Islands this fiscal year. American military doctors also recently performed free surgeries alongside local doctors on an American hospital ship in Honiara’s harbor.
“China never does this kind of thing,” said Dr. Catherine Tirri, 40, as she observed a fistula surgery. “China doesn’t do service.”
A more skeptical question followed: Would there be any American follow-up? A plan to reopen a long-closed embassy has been caught up in red tape, limiting the U.S. presence to three diplomats (and a dog) living and working out of hotel rooms, with an interim embassy scheduled to open later this year.
“The Americans need to show they can produce concrete outcomes,” countering China by strengthening transparency and accountability, said USC’s Wong.
From university students to religious leaders, many islanders seem to agree. Kosemu, the tribal chief, said frustration with China and its proxies kept intensifying.
“The people have had enough of making requests to the government and being ignored,” he said. “Protests may be the only way to make them listen.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

China's Decline Is Undeniable. Now What?: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For years, I've been writing columns predicting China's decline. This week, the decline became undeniable. The road downhill will not be smooth -- not for it or for us.
The news is that the death rate in China outnumbered the birthrate for the first time in more than 60 years. Last time, it was famine caused by Mao Zedong's economic policies that led to an estimated 36 million deaths from starvation. Now, it's young Chinese couples who, like their peers in much of the developed world, don't want children.
So far, the demographic downshift has been small -- 9.56 million births last year against 10.41 million deaths, according to Chinese government statistics. That's out of a total population of 1.4 billion. The country will not be running out of people anytime soon.
But the longer trend lines look awful for Beijing. In 1978, when Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms got underway, China's median age was 20.1 years. In 2021, it was 37.9, exceeding that of the United States. China's fertility rate is 1.18. The replacement rate necessary to maintain a stable population is 2.1. As of 2018, there were an estimated 34 million more males in China than females -- the result of a one-child policy that led couples to abort girls at a higher rate than boys. China's working-age population has been shrinking for years; a government spokesman estimated that it will fall to 700 million by the middle of the century.
If you think the world has too many people already, then all this might sound like good news. It's not. China is increasingly likely to grow old before it gets rich, consigning hundreds of millions of Chinese to a penurious and often lonely old age. A declining population generally correlates with economic decline -- roughly a one-percentage-point decline in economic growth for every percentage-point decline in population, according to Ruchir Sharma, a former head of emerging markets at Morgan Stanley. And China, both as an export hub and as a vast market, has been a major driver of global economic growth for four decades. Its weakness will ripple through the world economy.
But the scariest aspect of China's decline is geopolitical. When democracies experience economic problems, they tend to become inward looking and risk averse. When dictatorships do, they often become externally focused and risk inclined. Regimes that can't, or won't, address domestic discontents through political and economic reforms often try to do so through foreign adventures.
That's a point worth thinking about now that Beijing is also reporting the slowest rate of economic growth in nearly four decades. The immediate cause here is Xi Jinping's catastrophic mishandling of the Covid crisis -- the punitive lockdowns, the rejection of foreign vaccines, the abrupt end of restrictions, the constant lying.
But China's economy was already in trouble before the pandemic: a real estate bubble at the point of bursting, record high capital flight, the end of Hong Kong as a relatively free city and Chinese companies like Huawei increasingly unwelcome in Western countries on account of espionage and intellectual-property-theft concerns.
A pragmatic government might have been able to tackle these challenges. But Mr. Xi has appointed a gang of yes men to the Politburo for his unprecedented third term as supreme leader. If -- or as -- economic conditions deteriorate, they are likelier to find answers to their problems in aggression rather than reform. Think of inflationary Argentina on the eve of the invasion of the Falklands or bankrupt Iraq just before the invasion of Kuwait.
What should the United States do? Three things.
First, deterrence. The better Kyiv does militarily against Moscow, the more deeply the lesson will be learned in Beijing that taking Taipei wouldn't be as easy as it seems. The sooner Taiwan acquires large stores of easy-to-use, hard-to-target weapons such as Stinger and Javelin missiles, the more hesitant China's military planners will be to step on a sea urchin. The more the United States does to help Japan, Australia and other allies strengthen their militaries, the greater the deterrent effect it will have on China's regional ambitions.
The administration is doing much of this already. It needs to do more of it, much faster.
Second, trade détente. Trying to punish Beijing via Donald Trump's tariffs aggravates the relationship while harming both sides economically. We should offer to roll them back in exchange for guarantees from China that it will end its hacking campaigns against U.S. institutions.
If it cheats, the tariffs can be reimposed and doubled.
Finally, human rights. At every opportunity, the State Department should speak up loudly for China's dissidents. Jimmy Lai and Qin Yongmin, among others, should be as familiar to Americans as Andrei Sakharov and Natan Sharansky were in the 1970s. Their names should be raised at every bilateral meeting with Chinese officials not only out of concern for their lives but also as reminders that our fundamental differences with Beijing aren't strategic. They're moral.
In the long run, the greatest hope we can have for China is its people. The greatest investment we can make in the coming decades of turbulence is to keep faith with them.
