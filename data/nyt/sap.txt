Full text: The duo Brewer & Shipley reached the Top 10 in 1971 with "One Toke Over the Line," a ditty about marijuana that ran afoul of Nixon-era censors.
Michael Brewer, half of the folk-rock duo Brewer & Shipley, who scored an unlikely Top 10 hit in 1971 with "One Toke Over the Line" -- one of the most overt pop odes to marijuana of the hippie era and presumably the only one to be performed on the squeaky-clean "Lawrence Welk Show" -- died on Tuesday at his home near Branson, Mo. He was 80.
His death was confirmed in a social media post by his longtime recording and performing partner, Tom Shipley. No cause was given.
While often categorized as a one-hit wonder, Brewer & Shipley actually notched two other singles on the Billboard Hot 100: "Tarkio Road," which climbed to No. 55 in June 1970, and "Shake Off the Demon," which sneaked in at No. 98 in February 1972.
The duo, who recorded many albums in the 1970s and a few more in the '90s, were known for their songs' socially conscious lyrics on topics like the Vietnam War. But it was their sunny signature tune, with its indelible line "One toke over the line, sweet Jesus," that etched them into pop-culture history.
At the outset, Mr. Brewer and Mr. Shipley considered the song anything but a potentially career-defining composition. "We wrote it literally entertaining ourselves and to make our friends laugh," Mr. Brewer recalled in a 2022 interview on the music podcast "A Breath of Fresh Air."
The two were between sets during a gig at a nightclub in Kansas City, Mo., when inspiration, fueled by some potent cannabis, hit.
"We were getting ready to go onstage for our fourth set," Mr. Brewer said, "and a friend came by with some really good Lebanese hash. We stepped out back and took a couple of tokes and came back in to tune up for our last set, and Tom said, 'Man, I'm one toke over the line.' And I just cracked up."
Mr. Brewer began improvising a melody around that line, and the next day the two banged out the song in about an hour.
At the time, they were recording their third album, "Tarkio" (1970), and considered "One Toke" too trifling to commit to wax. They performed it live only out of necessity when they opened for the singer-songwriter Melanie at Carnegie Hall not long afterward.
"We went over really well, had a couple of encores, and then we basically ran out of songs," Mr. Brewer told Rockcellar magazine in 2012. "We said, 'Let's do that new song. Nothin' to lose.' So we did, and everybody loved it."
To their surprise, their record label insisted that they include it on their forthcoming album. The next thing they knew, it was a single, which peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard singles chart in April 1971. But as Brewer & Shipley would soon find out, that was a fraught era for drug songs.

Charles Michael Brewer was born on April 14, 1944, in Oklahoma City, the eldest of four children. He played drums and sang in a rock band in high school before switching to guitar. After graduation in 1962, he began performing his own songs in coffee houses around the country and eventually met Mr. Shipley, who grew up near Cleveland, at one in Kent, Ohio.
Settling in San Francisco in 1965, Mr. Brewer formed the duo Mastin & Brewer with the singer-songwriter Tom Mastin, whose song "How Do You Feel" would be recorded by Jefferson Airplane. After moving to Los Angeles, the two signed with Columbia Records and formed a band that opened for top acts like the Byrds and Buffalo Springfield.
Mr. Mastin, who suffered from depression, left the band before they could cut an album. Mr. Brewer then joined forces with Mr. Shipley, who by then was living near him in Los Angeles, and they signed on as staff songwriters for a publishing arm of A&M Records.
"Michael and I were both Midwesterners, Midwestern values," Mr. Shipley said in "One Toke Over the Line ... and Still Smokin'," a 2021 documentary about the duo. "Neither one of us were looking for stardom."
Still, they started playing their own compositions around town and recorded their first album, "Down in L.A.," released by A&M in 1968.
The success of "One Toke Over the Line," recorded after the duo returned to the Midwest, brought complications. In September 1970, Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, in a speech in Las Vegas, warned that drug use was threatening "to sap our national strength" and called out a number of pop songs, including the Beatles' "With a Little Help From My Friends" and the Byrds' "Eight Miles High," as "latent drug culture propaganda."
Within a year, under the Nixon administration, the Federal Communications Commission warned broadcasters about playing songs with lyrics that might promote drug use. As a result, "One Toke Over the Line" was banned by radio stations in Buffalo, Miami, Houston, Washington, Chicago, Dallas and New York. Brewer & Shipley, Mr. Brewer said, came to embrace the crackdown as "a badge of honor."
Information about his survivors was not immediately available.
The duo continued to perform for years, and Mr. Brewer also made a few albums as a solo artist.
Their signature song lived on as a playful totem of the hippie era. It was featured in "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas," the surrealistic 1998 drug odyssey based on the classic stoner chronicle by Hunter S. Thompson, directed by Terry Gilliam and starring Johnny Depp.
Even more surreal was a performance of the song on Lawrence Welk's wholesome variety show in 1971. "One Toke Over the Line," with its reference to "sweet Jesus," had been mistaken for a religious song, and the perky singers Gail Farrell and Dick Dale smiled and bobbed their way through a bouncy rendition.
"And there you heard a modern spiritual," Mr. Welk, the show's baton-wielding host, said afterward.
Mr. Brewer and Mr. Shipley missed the broadcast, and Mr. Brewer said it took him decades to find a clip of the performance. When he finally viewed it, he told Rockcellar, "I sat there with my mouth open."

Poppy Boom in Afghan Desert Has Gone Bust: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: An oasis stretched far into the desert, a vast sea of emerald stalks and scarlet poppy flowers that grew to the horizon.
The Taliban operated openly, running a social experiment unlike anything in the country. Tens -- then hundreds -- of thousands of people flocked here to escape the war and grow poppy, fleeing the American efforts to wipe out the crop.
The Taliban opened a trauma hospital to treat their wounded and earned a fortune, not just from opium, but also from methamphetamines and taxes on goods moving in and out of Afghanistan, bringing them millions upon millions of dollars every month.
During the war, this remote district became a laboratory for a future Taliban state, providing money for the war and a sanctuary for the men fighting it.
All that has changed. The Taliban boom town is rapidly going bust.
The same insurgents who embraced opium to help finance their war have put an end to it, ordering a ban that has all but cleared Afghanistan of poppy and other illicit drugs.
What the United States and its allies failed to do in two decades of war, the Taliban has managed in two years of peace. In an area where poppy once dominated the landscape, barely a stalk remains.
Hundreds of labs set up to process heroin and methamphetamines have been closed or destroyed. The drug bazaar that powered this part of southern Afghanistan has been all but emptied. And the nation, already reeling without international aid, has lost a sizable piece of its economy as a result.
On top of that, the Taliban government has stiffened its taxes, leaving residents bitter and angry. Many have moved away, except those too poor or invested to leave, like Abdul Khaliq.
"This is all coming to an end," he said, waving his hand toward the emptying villages.
There was almost nothing in this district, Bakwa, when he arrived 25 years ago, just an empty desert plain. He built an empire out of sand, selling the pumps and solar panels that provided water for the opium boom, helping turn Bakwa into a frontier outpost for smugglers, traders and farmers.
Now his story, like Bakwa's, has come full circle: the foreigners gone, the Taliban back in power, the earth stripped of poppy and the land returning to dust.
"It's a matter of time," he said.
The war in Afghanistan was many things: a mission to eliminate Al Qaeda and oust the group that gave safe harbor to Osama bin Laden; an ambitious drive to build a new Afghanistan, where Western ideals ran headlong into local traditions; a seemingly endless entanglement, where winning sometimes mattered less than not losing.
It was also a drug war.
The Americans and their allies tried again and again to sever the Taliban's income and stop one of the world's worst scourges: opium and heroin production.
The United States spent nearly $ 9 billion on heavy-handed eradication and interdiction, yet Afghanistan eclipsed its own records as the largest producer of illicit poppy in the world.
What did change was where that poppy was grown. Little by little, farmers flooded once empty deserts in southwestern Afghanistan, barren pockets of sand with almost no populations to speak of before.
Communities formed in starburst patterns along ancient irrigation lines, then moved farther into the desert to farm as they pleased. The Taliban followed, finding sanctuary in the utter remoteness of districts like Bakwa and their unnavigable roads.
At its height, the Taliban oversaw a narco-state here, a farm-to-table drug operation with hundreds of field labs processing opium into heroin and wild ephedra into methamphetamines for Europe, Asia and elsewhere. By the end of the war, Bakwa had become an entrepôt of the drug trade, home to the largest open-air drug market in the country.
The Taliban showed flexibility, too, both morally and financially. Despite banning poppy on religious grounds before the American invasion, the Taliban allowed farmers to grow as much of it as they wanted during the war.
And they taxed it loosely, often whatever farmers could afford, adopting a hearts-and-minds strategy. They also taxed smugglers, who were happy to help fund a Taliban war machine that didn't interfere with business.
Bakwa soon became an incubator for governance. Taliban courts adjudicated all manner of disputes, while millions of dollars flowed monthly to help finance the Taliban mission beyond Bakwa and the southwest.
Western officials took aim at that money. They began with eradication, then tried persuading farmers to grow legal crops, and ended with fighter jets bombing makeshift labs made of mud.
"At least $ 200 million of this opium industry goes into the Taliban's bank accounts," Gen. John Nicholson, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan in 2017, a year of peak poppy production, said at the time. "And this fuels -- really pays for the insurgency."
But the Taliban's customs checkpoints were just as essential in Bakwa, or even more so, taxing goods to the tune of $ 10 million a month or more, according to Taliban officials.
"The money from agriculture, poppy included, funded the war" in these regions, said Haji Maulavi Asif, now the Taliban's governor for Bakwa District. "But the money from the customs operation helped fund the entire movement."
Now that poppy has been banned, the farmers the Taliban once relied on feel betrayed, while the Taliban is trying to govern without the money it brings.
"While economically, the decision to ban poppy costs a lot, politically it makes sense," said Mr. Asif. "We are silencing the countries of the world who say we are growing poppy and participating in the global drug trade."
'Desert people' to opium entrepreneurs
When the war started in 2001, Mr. Khaliq barely noticed.
He had only recently bought land on a roadless expanse in Bakwa that cooked under the summer sun. But just beneath the surface, there was water, so bountiful that reeds grew in some areas. Mr. Khaliq, a mechanic, opened a tiny workshop to fix water pumps.
There were no phones and few neighbors back then, so when the Americans invaded, he heard about it only weeks later.
"We were desert people," he said. "We didn't care about the war. That was the concern of city people."
That changed quickly. Before the American invasion, the Taliban had banned poppy production, sending opium prices skyrocketing. Now that they were gone, Mr. Khaliq switched from growing wheat to poppy.
Others soon joined, and the desert took on new hues. Bright flowers and verdant stems softened the landscape. The money was good -- so good that the new Afghan government came knocking.
One day, Bakwa's new police chief showed up to marvel at how productive Mr. Khaliq's poppy fields were.
"I bet there's over half a ton of opium here," Mr. Khaliq recalled the chief saying.
"I told him it wasn't that much, but he charged me for that amount anyway," Mr. Khaliq said with a laugh. "And then he also asked for a bribe."
With the Americans in control of Bakwa, eradication programs gained momentum. The district governor soon arrived with great fanfare, bringing a tractor, cameras and an entourage of police.
He gathered the farmers and announced there would be no more poppy because the foreigners were serious about getting rid of Afghan opium.
Mr. Khaliq and others watched with quiet indignation as the tractor plowed through a neighbor's field. But after a short exhibition, the tractor stopped and a photographer was summoned.
"They took pictures of the small destroyed area," Mr. Khaliq recalled. "Then, they took bribes and left."
So went the early American-backed eradication campaigns in Bakwa, and the farmers adapted right away. They began pooling their money to compensate whoever's crops were destroyed for show.
As word spread, newcomers began arriving in droves. Unfamiliar faces turned up weekly to Mr. Khaliq's garage, dragging motors for him to fix. He stocked spare parts and water pipes, and began selling gas.
"Our business grew with the population, but we never expected it to grow so much," he said.
The Taliban's 'pivot'
Mr. Khaliq didn't care much for the Taliban at first. He found them harsh and overbearing, propagandizing about their faith while turning on the people around them.
"They were killing people and denouncing them as spies, even visitors who came to see family," said Haji Abdul Salam, one of Bakwa's largest landowners.
But they learned from their mistakes as they notched military gains. By 2006, a resurgent Taliban was carrying out its first major offensive since being ousted, laying waste to nearby districts in Helmand Province.
A steady stream of refugees arrived in Bakwa, and more Taliban followed, from fighters to mullahs, seeking shelter and opportunity.
"I moved to this area because it was safe," said Haji Naim, Mr. Khaliq's cousin, a Taliban fighter.
Bakwa turned out to be a great place to hide. The terrain was flat, making it easy to spot incoming raids. The ground was silty, which made planting roadside bombs simple. The roads meandered with such arbitrary vigor that only locals knew how to navigate them.
"There is not a single straight road in Bakwa," said Mr. Khaliq. "If you spot a Taliban, you can't even chase him."
As they claimed more territory, the Taliban "learned to pivot," said Mr. Salam, who helps oversees the main tribal council in Bakwa. "They began to prosecute their own officials, and brought real justice and accountability."
The Taliban eventually squeezed the Afghan government into a tiny corner of the district, forcing it to abandon any pretense of control over the area.
Hundreds of workers descended on Bakwa to collect opium sap each harvest, while an industry of buyers and smugglers coalesced around an open-air drug market known as the Abdul Wadood Bazaar.
The bazaar drew thousands at times, a vast collection of frontiersmen trading in illicit goods. An entire logistics network developed to serve the trade.
The Taliban ran neither the market nor the drug trade but taxed all of it.
The money added up -- and caught the eye of the Americans.
Solar panels and mobile courts
Eradication wasn't working. In 2007, the peak of the effort -- with officials reporting 19,000 hectares of poppy destroyed -- Afghanistan still broke a record for poppy cultivation.
Increasingly, the Americans and their allies began prosecuting a more conventional drug war in places like Bakwa, staging raids on smugglers and their networks. Violent interdiction became the norm, infuriating residents.
The Taliban, by contrast, endorsed the drug trade, at least while it was serving their interests. Though they had banned poppy before, they didn't seem to worry much about the contradiction during the war. To the contrary, they appointed Islamic scholars who delivered sermons on the importance of supporting the jihad and expelling foreigners.
"The secret to their success was religious propaganda," said Haji Abdullah Khan, a lifelong Bakwa resident. "People didn't like the Taliban, but they didn't want Christians or Jews here."
On more administrative matters, the Taliban also assigned a district governor. Such shadow governors, as they were called, were high-value targets for the Americans and Afghan forces. But Bakwa was so safe for the insurgents that it became a magnet for senior Taliban leaders.
The Taliban established mobile courts, with judges riding around the district, meting out justice on the road. Prisoners would be locked in cars while the officiants went about their business, including the execution of thieves and murderers.
Sometimes, the Taliban would ask locals to host the courts, including Mr. Khaliq. Too frightened to refuse, he said he held more than a few on his compound, just as he sold them gas and offered them tea whenever they came through. But he never warmed to the insurgents.
Which made it all the more frustrating to him when U.S. forces, who operated out of bases in nearby areas, raided his home on multiple occasions.
"I just did what I needed to do regardless of who was in power," he said.
A constant stream of visitors came to Mr. Khaliq's expanding compound, which by about 2014 included new storage units, a new garage and a small kiosk selling snacks and sodas.
Lines of customers waited in his courtyard -- sometimes for days -- to purchase the most revolutionary piece of farming technology to emerge during the war: solar panels to run Bakwa's ubiquitous water pumps.
"We must have sold tens of thousands of units," Mr. Khaliq said.
The desert was transformed once more, now with the black tiles of solar setups. Water reservoirs became the norm, an incredibly wasteful method of irrigation that uses open-air pools, which evaporate quickly in the desert heat.
Newcomers claimed even more pieces of desert. The growth was so rapid that international experts on poppy cultivation, like David Mansfield, tracked it via satellite imagery, monitoring the stamps of green invading a sea of brown.
"The Americans and their allies pushed the farmers and sharecroppers into the desert, where they were greeted by the Taliban and welcomed with open arms," said Mr. Mansfield, an analyst on Afghanistan.
By 2016, he added, more than 300,000 acres of land were being cultivated in Bakwa, a sixfold increase from 2003. The population more than quintupled to an estimated 320,000 people.
The Taliban grew with it. That same year, they finally claimed the district center in Bakwa, the last remaining symbol of the Afghan government.
The squat concrete building had been constructed with American money just four years earlier, in 2012. (Insurgents had burned down the previous one.) Once in control of the $ 200,000 facility, the Taliban turned it into a hospital.
"The hospital would treat 200 to 250 patients a day," said Abdul Wasi, a nurse there. "It was a trauma center for the Taliban. Fighters from all over the region would come here."
The local Afghan government, having abandoned the district altogether, moved to a few containers along the side of a highway.
Heroin, meth and taxes
Bakwa became a Taliban financial capital, collecting taxes like any other formal authority.
Though the American-backed government controlled the official customs checkpoints in and out of Afghanistan, the Taliban set up their own.
They placed them on highways leading to and from Iran, Turkmenistan and Pakistan, charging hundreds of dollars per commercial vehicle. The Taliban even issued receipts.
The money, estimated at around $ 10 million a month, overshadowed the taxes from poppy farmers and smugglers, local Taliban officials say -- and it was all administered from Bakwa.
The district changed yet again. Poppy had been like an anchor tenant in a vast drug emporium. Next, labs began sprouting up to process heroin, a more lucrative venture. Those, in turn, gave way to new labs producing methamphetamines.
The labs proliferated along the edges of the open-air market. Some used cough medicine, draining amber bottles of pseudoephedrine and cooking it down. But ephedra, a shrub that blanketed the central highlands of Afghanistan, soon transformed the industry.
Hundreds of people, if not thousands, worked in the burgeoning meth trade, transporting, milling and producing the drug from the wild ephedra crop.
Mr. Mansfield estimated that hundreds of tons of meth were produced in Bakwa alone, even as poppy continued breaking records. In 2017, Afghanistan cultivated more opium than in any year since the start of the war.
The United States, desperate for a forceful response, redoubled its efforts. Fighter jets and B-52 bombers launched a two-year campaign to destroy labs across southwestern Afghanistan, including in Bakwa.
An estimated 200 labs were destroyed, many of them mud huts and lean-tos leveled by munitions that cost many times what they had obliterated. Little changed. By 2020, hundreds of labs were still churning out heroin and meth.
A drug market turned ghost town
The collapse came as quickly as the boom. One year, it seemed to Mr. Khaliq, business was bountiful. The next, Bakwa was practically empty again.
He noticed the change before many of his neighbors. Fewer customers came. Solar panel orders got smaller. Some were being canceled altogether.
It was 2019, not long after U.S. airstrikes in Bakwa killed 30 people, including many women and children, he said. Yet all anyone wanted to talk about was water.
There had been so much water, for such a long time, that no one considered it might run out. Experts commissioned by U.S.A.I.D. in 2009 had found a huge aquifer under Bakwa, one that seemed destined to last.
"I was surprised at the amount of water they had in the area," said Darren Richardson, who had commissioned the study. "That was a significant aquifer."
And yet, only a decade later, the water was growing scarce.
Despite the American airstrikes and water worries, Bakwa remained a center of the drug trade. Poppy had a long shelf life once harvested. Its watering needs coincided with the spring snowmelt from the neighboring mountains. The trade could hold on, residents reasoned.
But then the war ended.
The Americans withdrew for good in 2021 and the Taliban took over. Months later, the supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, declared that poppy cultivation was "absolutely prohibited in the whole country."
The Taliban claimed to have arrested numerous traffickers, seized nearly 2,000 tons of drugs and raided hundreds of heroin labs. In 2023, the Taliban destroyed dozens of labs in Bakwa, setting them ablaze.
Where the Americans had cherry-picked from the sky, killing or injuring innocents along the way, the Taliban removed nearly every laboratory in Bakwa. The Abdul Wadood Bazaar hollowed out.
With ruthless efficiency, the Taliban did what the United States had hoped for. They got rid of poppy farming, and in doing so, severed one of their economic lifelines.
The remnants of the boom haunt the landscape: abandoned well derricks, stark against the acid sky; old food wrappers and animal droppings desiccated in vacant courtyards.
Farmers blame the Taliban for their misery. For nearly 15 years, their poppy -- and the taxes the Taliban collected from it -- supported the insurgents' war to establish a government.
Now that the Taliban got what they wanted, they have forgotten the people of Bakwa who made it all possible, residents grumble. Farmers too poor to leave now send their sons to work on harvests elsewhere, renting them out as labor.
"We have no choice but to stick it out," said Haji Hawaladar, who had moved his entire family to Bakwa, trading his herd of goats for land. Now, he added, "we could not even give this land away for free."
The Taliban seemed to have no reservations about leaving. Today, the district is largely empty of administrators and fighters. Many have moved on to bigger roles in other places.
"This was like a test, or an exam," said Mr. Asif, the district governor. "Trusted people got important positions. The people who did well in Bakwa were top of that list."
In Mr. Khaliq's compound on a recent evening, as a honeyed light washed over the desert, nieces and nephews played in the courtyard, while a son stood idly by the gas pumps, waiting for customers who never came.
A few years earlier, his grounds would have been teeming with life. Today, he is selling a tenth of what he once did.
"The only thing that might help would be growing poppy with the water that is left," said Mr. Khaliq. "But those who tried, the Taliban came and destroyed their crop."
A few farmers have turned their fields to wheat, and shocks of green punctuate vast brown fields. Mr. Khaliq's neighbors have moved away, leaving him alone with his crumbling fortune.
Like others, Mr. Khaliq holds the Taliban responsible. They could have enforced water rights agreements, as exist all over Afghanistan. They could ease their ban on poppy to keep the farmers afloat.
"The Taliban did not solve the biggest issues, water and the economy," he said.
Like others, he knows some people are still hoarding opium reserves to sell at a high price, given the ban. Prices have more than quintupled since 2021, and some are still getting rich.
But everything he owns has lost value: his land and equipment, and hundreds of solar panels that sit in tidy rows, waiting for farmers who will never come back. The barren furrows of earth swirl like fingerprints over a monochromatic desert, a reminder of what was.
"This is life," he says. "Everything ends. I will be done one day, too. But even if this ends, somewhere else will be beginning."

BAKWA DISTRICT, Afghanistan — An oasis stretched far into the desert, a vast sea of emerald stalks and scarlet poppy flowers that grew to the horizon.
The Taliban operated openly, running a social experiment unlike anything in the country. Tens — then hundreds — of thousands of people flocked here to escape the war and grow poppy, fleeing the American efforts to wipe out the crop.
The Taliban opened a trauma hospital to treat their wounded and earned a fortune, not just from opium, but also from methamphetamine and taxes on goods moving in and out of Afghanistan, bringing them millions upon millions of dollars every month.
During the war, the remote district of Bakwa became a laboratory for a future Taliban state, providing money for the war and a sanctuary for the men fighting it.
All that has changed. The Taliban boom is rapidly going bust.
The same insurgents who embraced opium to help finance their war have put an end to it, ordering a ban that has all but cleared Afghanistan of poppy and illicit drugs.
What the United States and its allies failed to do in two decades of war, the Taliban has managed in two years of peace. In an area where poppy once dominated the landscape, barely a stalk remains.
Hundreds of labs set up to process heroin and methamphetamine have been closed or destroyed. The drug bazaar that powered this part of southern Afghanistan has been all but emptied. And the nation, already reeling without international aid, has lost a sizable piece of its economy as a result.
On top of that, the Taliban government has stiffened its taxes, leaving residents bitter and angry. Many have moved away, except those too poor or invested to leave, like Abdul Khaliq.
“This is all coming to an end,” he said, waving his hand toward the emptying villages.
There was almost nothing in this district, Bakwa, when he arrived 25 years ago, just an empty desert plain. He built an empire out of sand, selling the pumps and solar panels that provided water for the opium boom, helping turn Bakwa into a frontier outpost for smugglers, traders and farmers.
Now his story, like Bakwa’s, has come full circle: the foreigners gone, the Taliban back in power, the earth stripped of poppy and the land returning to dust.
“It’s a matter of time,” he said.
The war in Afghanistan was many things: a mission to eliminate al-Qaida and oust the group that gave safe harbor to Osama bin Laden; an ambitious drive to build a new Afghanistan, where Western ideals ran headlong into local traditions; and a seemingly endless entanglement, where winning sometimes mattered less than not losing.
It was also a drug war.
The Americans and their allies tried again and again to sever the Taliban’s income and stop one of the world’s worst scourges: opium and heroin production.
The United States spent nearly $9 billion on heavy-handed eradication and interdiction, yet Afghanistan eclipsed its own record as the largest producer of illicit poppy in the world.
What did change was where that poppy was grown. Little by little, farmers flooded once empty deserts in southwestern Afghanistan, barren pockets of sand with almost no populations to speak of before.
Communities formed in starburst patterns along ancient irrigation lines, then moved farther into the desert to farm as they pleased. The Taliban followed, finding sanctuary in the utter remoteness of districts like Bakwa and their unnavigable roads.
At its height, the Taliban oversaw a narco-state here, a farm-to-table drug operation with hundreds of field labs processing opium into heroin and wild ephedra into methamphetamine for Europe, Asia and elsewhere. By the end of the war, Bakwa had become an entrepôt of the drug trade, home to the largest open-air drug market in the country.
The Taliban showed flexibility, too, both morally and financially. Despite banning poppy on religious grounds before the American invasion, the Taliban allowed farmers to grow as much of it as they wanted during the war.
And they taxed it loosely, often whatever farmers could afford, adopting a hearts-and-minds strategy. They also taxed smugglers, who were happy to help fund a Taliban war machine that didn’t interfere with business.
Bakwa soon became an incubator for governance. Taliban courts adjudicated all manner of disputes, while millions of dollars flowed monthly to help finance the Taliban mission beyond Bakwa and the southwest.
Western officials took aim at that money. They began with eradication, then tried persuading farmers to grow legal crops, and ended with fighter jets bombing makeshift labs made of mud.
“At least $200 million of this opium industry goes into the Taliban’s bank accounts,” Gen. John Nicholson, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan in 2017, a year of peak poppy production, said at the time. “And this fuels — really pays for the insurgency.”
But the Taliban’s customs checkpoints were just as essential in Bakwa, or even more so, taxing goods to the tune of $10 million a month or more, according to Taliban officials.
“The money from agriculture, poppy included, funded the war” in these regions, said Haji Maulavi Asif, now the Taliban’s governor for the Bakwa district. “But the money from the customs operation helped fund the entire movement.”
Now that poppy has been banned, the farmers the Taliban once relied on feel betrayed, while the Taliban is trying to govern without the money it brings.
“While economically, the decision to ban poppy costs a lot, politically it makes sense,” said Asif. “We are silencing the countries of the world who say we are growing poppy and participating in the global drug trade.”
Opium Entrepreneurs
When the war started in 2001, Khaliq barely noticed.
He had only recently bought land on a roadless expanse in Bakwa that cooked under the summer sun. But just beneath the surface there was water, so bountiful that reeds grew in some areas. Khaliq, a mechanic, opened a tiny workshop to fix water pumps.
There were no phones and few neighbors back then, so when the Americans invaded, he heard about it weeks later.
“We were desert people,” he said. “We didn’t care about the war. That was the concern of city people.”
That changed quickly. Before the American invasion, the Taliban had banned poppy production, sending opium prices skyrocketing. Now that they were gone, Khaliq switched from growing wheat to poppy.
Others soon joined, and the desert took on new hues. Bright flowers and verdant stems softened the landscape. The money was good — so good that the new Afghan government came knocking.
One day, Bakwa’s new police chief showed up to marvel at how productive Khaliq’s poppy fields were.
“I bet there’s over half a ton of opium here,” Khaliq recalled the chief saying.
“I told him it wasn’t that much, but he charged me for that amount anyway,” Khaliq said with a laugh. “And then he also asked for a bribe.”
With the Americans in control of Bakwa, eradication programs gained momentum. The district governor soon arrived with great fanfare, bringing a tractor, cameras and an entourage of police.
He gathered the farmers and announced there would be no more poppy because the foreigners were serious about getting rid of Afghan opium.
Khaliq and others watched with quiet indignation as the tractor plowed through a neighbor’s field. But after a short exhibition, the tractor stopped and a photographer was summoned.
“They took pictures of the small destroyed area,” Khaliq recalled. “Then, they took bribes and left.”
So went the early American-backed eradication campaigns in Bakwa, and the farmers adapted right away. They began pooling their money to compensate whoever’s crops were destroyed for show.
As word spread, newcomers began arriving in droves. Unfamiliar faces turned up weekly to Khaliq’s garage, dragging motors for him to fix. He stocked spare parts and water pipes, and began selling gas.
“Our business grew with the population, but we never expected it to grow so much,” he said.
The Taliban Pivot
Khaliq didn’t care much for the Taliban at first. He found them harsh and overbearing, propagandizing about their faith while turning on the people around them.
“They were killing people and denouncing them as spies, even visitors who came to see family,” said Haji Abdul Salam, one of Bakwa’s largest landowners.
But they learned from their mistakes as they notched military gains. By 2006, a resurgent Taliban was carrying out its first major offensive since being ousted, laying waste to nearby districts in Helmand province.
A steady stream of refugees arrived in Bakwa, and more Taliban followed, from fighters to mullahs, seeking shelter and opportunity.
“I moved to this area because it was safe,” said Haji Naim, Khaliq’s cousin, a Taliban fighter.
Bakwa turned out to be a great place to hide. The terrain was flat, making it easy to spot incoming raids. The ground was silty, which made planting roadside bombs simple. The roads meandered with such arbitrary vigor that only locals knew how to navigate them.
“There is not a single straight road in Bakwa,” said Khaliq. “If you spot a Taliban, you can’t even chase him.”
As they claimed more territory, the Taliban “learned to pivot,” said Salam, who helps oversees the main tribal council in Bakwa. “They began to prosecute their own officials, and brought real justice and accountability.”
The Taliban eventually squeezed the Afghan government into a tiny corner of the district, forcing it to abandon any pretense of control over the area.
Hundreds of workers descended on Bakwa to collect poppy sap for opium each harvest, while an industry of buyers and smugglers coalesced around an open-air drug market known as the Abdul Wadood Bazaar.
The bazaar drew thousands at times, a vast collection of frontiersmen trading in illicit goods. An entire logistics network developed to serve the trade.
The Taliban ran neither the market nor the drug trade but taxed all of it.
The money added up — and caught the eye of the Americans.
Mobile Justice
Eradication wasn’t working. In 2007, the peak of the effort — with officials reporting 19,000 hectares of poppy destroyed — Afghanistan still broke a record for poppy cultivation.
Increasingly, the Americans and their allies began prosecuting a more conventional drug war in places like Bakwa, staging raids on smugglers and their networks. Violent interdiction became the norm, infuriating residents.
The Taliban, by contrast, endorsed the drug trade, at least while it was serving their interests. Though they had banned poppy before, they didn’t seem to worry much about the contradiction during the war. To the contrary, they appointed Islamic scholars who delivered sermons on the importance of supporting the jihad and expelling foreigners.
“The secret to their success was religious propaganda,” said Haji Abdullah Khan, a lifelong Bakwa resident. “People didn’t like the Taliban, but they didn’t want Christians or Jews here.”
On more administrative matters, the Taliban also assigned a district governor. Such shadow governors, as they were called, were high-value targets for the Americans and Afghan forces. But Bakwa was so safe for the insurgents that it became a magnet for senior Taliban leaders.
The Taliban established mobile courts, with judges riding around the district, meting out justice on the road. Prisoners would be locked in cars while the officiants went about their business, including the execution of thieves and murderers.
Sometimes, the Taliban would ask local residents to host the courts, including Khaliq. Too frightened to refuse, he said he held more than a few on his compound, just as he sold them gas and offered them tea whenever they came through. But he never warmed to the insurgents.
Which made it all the more frustrating to him when U.S. forces, who operated out of bases in nearby areas, raided his home on multiple occasions.
“I just did what I needed to do regardless of who was in power,” he said.
A constant stream of visitors came to Khaliq’s expanding compound, which by about 2014 included new storage units, a new garage and a small kiosk selling snacks and sodas.
Lines of customers waited in his courtyard — sometimes for days — to purchase the most revolutionary piece of farming technology to emerge during the war: solar panels to run Bakwa’s ubiquitous water pumps.
“We must have sold tens of thousands of units,” Khaliq said.
The desert was transformed once more, now with the black tiles of solar setups. Water reservoirs became the norm, an incredibly wasteful method of irrigation that uses open-air pools, which evaporate quickly in the desert heat.
Newcomers claimed even more pieces of desert. The growth was so rapid that international experts on poppy cultivation, like David Mansfield, tracked it via satellite imagery, monitoring the stamps of green invading a sea of brown.
“The Americans and their allies pushed the farmers and sharecroppers into the desert, where they were greeted by the Taliban and welcomed with open arms,” said Mansfield, an analyst on Afghanistan.
By 2016, he said, more than 300,000 acres were being cultivated in Bakwa, a sixfold increase from 2003. The population more than quintupled to an estimated 320,000 people.
The Taliban grew with it. That same year, they finally claimed the district center in Bakwa, the last remaining symbol of the Afghan government.
The squat concrete building had been constructed with American money just four years earlier, in 2012. (Insurgents had burned down the previous one.) Once in control of the $200,000 facility, the Taliban turned it into a hospital.
“The hospital would treat 200 to 250 patients a day,” said Abdul Wasi, a nurse there. “It was a trauma center for the Taliban. Fighters from all over the region would come here.”
The local Afghan government, having abandoned the district altogether, moved to a few containers along the side of a highway.
Heroin and Meth
Bakwa became a Taliban financial capital, collecting taxes like a formal authority would.
Though the American-backed government controlled the official customs checkpoints in and out of Afghanistan, the Taliban set up their own.
They placed them on highways leading to and from Iran, Turkmenistan and Pakistan, charging hundreds of dollars per commercial vehicle. The Taliban even issued receipts.
The money, estimated at around $10 million a month, overshadowed the taxes from poppy farmers and smugglers, local Taliban officials say — and it was all administered from Bakwa.
The district changed yet again. Opium had been like an anchor tenant in a vast drug emporium. Next, labs began sprouting up to process heroin, a more lucrative venture. Those, in turn, gave way to labs producing methamphetamine.
The labs proliferated along the edges of the open-air market. Some used cough medicine, draining amber bottles of pseudoephedrine and cooking it down. But ephedra, a shrub that blanketed the central highlands of Afghanistan, soon transformed the industry.
Hundreds of people, if not thousands, worked in the burgeoning meth trade, transporting, milling and producing the drug from the wild ephedra crop.
Mansfield estimated that hundreds of tons of meth were produced in Bakwa alone, even as poppy continued breaking records. In 2017, Afghanistan cultivated more opium than in any year since the start of the war.
The United States, desperate for a forceful response, redoubled its efforts. Fighter jets and B-52 bombers were used in a two-year campaign to destroy labs across southwestern Afghanistan, including in Bakwa.
An estimated 200 labs were destroyed, many of them mud huts and lean-tos leveled by munitions that cost many times what they had obliterated. Little changed. By 2020, hundreds of labs were still churning out heroin and meth.
Ghost Town
The collapse came as quickly as the boom. One year, it seemed to Khaliq, business was bountiful. The next, Bakwa was practically empty again.
He noticed the change before many of his neighbors. Fewer customers came. Solar panel orders got smaller. Some were being canceled altogether.
It was 2019, not long after U.S. airstrikes in Bakwa killed 30 people, including many women and children, he said. Yet all anyone wanted to talk about was water.
There had been so much water, for such a long time, that no one considered it might run out. Experts commissioned by U.S. Agency for International Development in 2009 had found a huge aquifer under Bakwa, one that seemed destined to last.
“I was surprised at the amount of water they had in the area,” said Darren Richardson, who had commissioned the study. “That was a significant aquifer.”
And yet, only a decade later, the water was growing scarce.
Despite the American airstrikes and water worries, Bakwa remained a center of the drug trade. Poppy had a long shelf life once harvested. Its watering needs coincided with the spring snowmelt from the neighboring mountains. The trade could hold on, residents reasoned.
But then the war ended.
The Americans withdrew for good in 2021 and the Taliban took over. Months later, the supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, declared that poppy cultivation was “absolutely prohibited in the whole country.”
The Taliban claimed to have arrested numerous traffickers, seized nearly 2,000 tons of drugs and raided hundreds of heroin labs. In 2023, the Taliban destroyed dozens of labs in Bakwa, setting them ablaze.
Where the Americans had cherry-picked from the sky, killing or injuring innocents along the way, the Taliban removed nearly every laboratory in Bakwa. The Abdul Wadood Bazaar hollowed out.
With ruthless efficiency, the Taliban did what the United States had hoped for. They got rid of poppy farming, and in doing so severed one of their economic lifelines.
The remnants of the boom haunt the landscape: abandoned well derricks, stark against the acid sky; old food wrappers and animal droppings desiccated in vacant courtyards.
Farmers blame the Taliban for their misery. For nearly 15 years, their poppy — and the taxes the Taliban collected from it — supported the insurgents’ war to establish a government.
Now that the Taliban got what they wanted, they have forgotten the people of Bakwa who made it all possible, residents grumble. Farmers too poor to leave now send their sons to work on harvests elsewhere, renting them out as labor.
“We have no choice but to stick it out,” said Haji Hawaladar, who had moved his entire family to Bakwa, trading his herd of goats for land. Now, he added, “we could not even give this land away for free.”
The Taliban seemed to have no reservations about leaving. Today, the district is largely empty of administrators and fighters. Many have moved on to bigger roles in other places.
“This was like a test, or an exam,” said Asif, the district governor. “Trusted people got important positions. The people who did well in Bakwa were top of that list.”
In Khaliq’s compound on a recent evening, as a honeyed light washed over the desert, nieces and nephews played in the courtyard, while a son stood idly by the gas pumps, waiting for customers who never came.
A few years earlier, his grounds would have been teeming with life. Today, he is selling a tenth of what he once did.
“The only thing that might help would be growing poppy with the water that is left,” said Khaliq. “But those who tried, the Taliban came and destroyed their crop.”
A few farmers have turned their fields to wheat, and shocks of green punctuate vast brown fields. Khaliq’s neighbors have moved away, leaving him alone with his crumbling fortune.
Like others, Khaliq holds the Taliban responsible. They could have enforced water rights agreements, as exist all over Afghanistan. They could ease their ban on poppy to keep the farmers afloat.
“The Taliban did not solve the biggest issues, water and the economy,” he said.
Like others, he knows some people are still hoarding opium reserves to sell at a high price, given the ban. Prices have more than quintupled since 2021, and some are still getting rich.
But everything he owns has lost value: his land and equipment, and hundreds of solar panels that sit in tidy rows, waiting for farmers who will never come back. The barren furrows of earth swirl like fingerprints over a monochromatic desert, a reminder of what was.
“This is life,” he said. “Everything ends. I will be done one day, too. But even if this ends, somewhere else will be beginning.”

Full text: People who had severe infections are especially vulnerable.
Since nearly the start of the pandemic, scientists have known that a Covid-19 infection increases the risk of heart problems. A growing body of research now suggests that this risk can last until well after the infection has cleared.
One recent study, conducted by researchers at the University of Southern California and Cleveland Clinic, found that a Covid-19 infection doubled the risk of a major cardiovascular event for up to three years afterward. What's more, the study found that infections severe enough to require hospitalization increased the likelihood of cardiac events as much as -- or more than -- having previously had a heart attack did.
"A lot of people are at even greater risk of heart attack than they were before," said Dr. David Goff, director for the cardiovascular sciences division at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, which provided funding for the study. "And heart disease is already the leading cause of death on our planet before the pandemic. So this is really concerning."
Given the volume of evidence now linking Covid-19 to heart inflammation, heart failure, arrhythmia and other cardiovascular issues, experts said, doctors should be taking a closer look at patients' Covid history.
People who had a severe infection "should be considered at high risk for future cardiovascular events," said Dr. Stanley Hazen, the chair of the department of cardiovascular and metabolic sciences at Cleveland Clinic and one of the authors of the new study.
The Science on Covid and the Heart
Anyone who has had an infection faces an elevated risk of heart problems, and research shows this risk is highest around the time of initial infection and for those who had the most severe disease, said Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, chief of research and development at the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Healthcare System.
Dr. Al-Aly analyzed data from a national V.A. database and compared outcomes after one year of patients who had a Covid infection and of those who did not. For every 1,000 patients, there were 23 more "major adverse cardiac events," almost 20 more cases of irregular heartbeat and 10 more incidents related to blood clotting disorders in the Covid group than the control group. By the three-year mark, the risk of heart problems had fallen to base-line levels for patients who had not been hospitalized but remained somewhat elevated for those who had.
Dr. Al-Aly's research has also shown that the incidence of long-term heart problems associated with Covid has dropped since the beginning of the pandemic, as the virus mutated into somewhat milder strains and more people got vaccinated.
Though people are still getting sick from Covid and developing long-term health issues from it, Dr. Al-Aly said, "it's undeniably much, much less than before."
The new study, which analyzed a large data set from Britain of patients age 50 and up, reaffirmed some of the earlier findings, showing that those hospitalized for Covid-19 were almost four times as likely to have a heart attack or stroke or die over the following three years as those who did not have an infection.
Unlike other research, though, the study found that for all patients who had a Covid infection, the elevated risk persisted at relatively the same level for as long as follow-up data was available -- nearly three years.
"That's actually one of the more surprising findings," Dr. Hazen said. "There's no signs of attenuation of that risk."
How Does Covid Cause Heart Disease?
Scientists aren't entirely sure how exactly a Covid infection causes cardiovascular disease, but they suspect a few pathways are at play.
The virus can damage the endothelial cells that line blood vessels, leading to inflammation, Dr. Goff said. This could cause a plaque that has already built up from cholesterol and other materials to break apart, form a clot and block a blood vessel, in turn leading to a heart attack or stroke.
That type of blockage can cause sudden death or downstream damage to heart muscles and other tissue, ultimately leading to heart failure or an arrhythmia, Dr. Goff explained.
Even without pre-existing plaque buildup, Dr. Al-Aly said, there is growing evidence that an infection can activate an inflammatory pathway that makes platelets clump up and form clots that can clog blood vessels.
It's also possible that in some cases, the body may not completely get rid of the virus, creating low-grade chronic inflammation that could damage heart tissues and subsequently lead to heart disease, he said.
The new study found that people with a non-O blood type -- A, B or AB -- have an especially increased risk for heart disease after a Covid-19 infection, though having an O blood type doesn't eliminate the risk entirely. It's not clear why this is the case, Dr. Hazen said, but it appears that blood type may be linked to clotting risk.
How to Protect Your Heart
The first thing you should do is to get your vaccine or booster, doctors said. Vaccines reduce the severity of an initial infection, making you less likely to end up in the hospital. Vaccines also boost the immune system's ability to clear the virus, Dr. Al-Aly said, reducing the odds of a persistent infection that causes chronic inflammation.
Beyond vaccination, doctors recommend taking the connection between Covid and heart disease seriously -- especially if you had a severe infection or already have a risk factor like high cholesterol, high blood pressure or diabetes.
After you have recovered from Covid, "see your doctor, so you know your numbers," Dr. Goff said.
More research needs to be done on how, exactly, Covid increases heart disease risk and what treatments might effectively reduce that risk, Dr. Goff said. But doctors and patients already have some tools at their disposal.
For example, when someone is at increased risk for heart disease because of elevated cholesterol or diabetes, doctors may recommend statins.
Low-dose aspirin also can help prevent blood clotting in high-risk patients. In the new study, patients who reported taking aspirin before getting Covid were less likely to have a heart attack or stroke after the infection than patients who did not.
If you have had a severe Covid infection, Dr. Goff said, you can reduce your risk of heart disease by eating a healthy diet, such as the DASH diet, getting plenty of physical activity, maintaining a normal body weight, avoiding cigarette smoking and secondhand smoke and getting good rest every night.
And even if you haven't had a severe Covid infection, these measures will help protect your heart, too.

Why Is Filing Expenses So Difficult?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Lieber, Ron

Full text: We hate them. The companies that build expense management software know that we hate them. They would like things to be different.
Once you file a few expense reports at work, a couple of things become clear.
First, expense management software is designed for and sold to finance departments to keep employee spending in line. Often, it feels as if no one did any user testing with everyday workers.
Second, many of the people who approve your expense reports think that if the process is noxious enough, then you won't submit as many expenses.
This is not too cynical of a read. Geoff Charles, the vice president of product at Ramp, which makes reporting software, said in an interview that finance executives had told him that they liked making people jump through hoops.
Even so, we dare to dream of a day when expense reports just happen: You spend money at work, the software starts a report automatically and approval occurs without our ever touching it.
The good news is that the software companies share that dream. If everyone hates their tools a bit less, they win, too.
Expense reports are a necessary evil. Securities laws require a certain amount of financial reporting for public companies, and tracking what a company spends is part of this. Tax laws matter, too, since certain items are deductible at different rates.
And as much as we would like our employers to trust us, people do cheat. Witness the Facebook employees who lost their jobs last month in the wake of what appeared to be misuse of the company's meal credits, as The Financial Times reported.
The push and pull -- and eventual pain -- of doing expense reports is around the controls that employers put in place. Consider travel: Bosses can elect to restrict what you buy (only certain hotel chains at a particular price, say), how you buy it (the type of credit card) and how you are reimbursed (that's where the software comes in).
Start-ups like Navan and Ramp aim to make this all happen seamlessly in one place. They provide travel booking engines and corporate cards loaded with rules that your employer customizes and also supply the software to track and approve it all.
If artificial intelligence is good for anything, it ought to be able to grab a line item from a credit-card bill and drop it into an expense report. The companies that make expense management software are training robots to do that -- and to grab receipts from your email inbox or directly from businesses like Uber. And yes, they are well aware of the number of brain cells you kill each year itemizing the taxes from hotel bills.
So why don't we have no-touch expense reports yet? Some information isn't on a credit-card bill or a receipt, like who you were with when a dinner tab reached $ 500 or how it got so high. David Barrett, founder and chief executive of Expensify, said one way to ease some of the pain was to use quick direct messaging for any necessary clarification. Follow-ups by email festooned with warnings and links are inefficient.
If A.I. expense reports feel far removed from your reality, there may be a few reasons. If you're not already using your employer's recommended travel booking engine and corporate card, you may be missing out on existing automation that would make your life easier.
It's also possible that any app you have access to is easier to use than the outdated desktop interface that you've been defaulting to for years. Apps can allow you to scan receipts as you go, if you have the discipline to press pause for a minute to do the deed.
If your system is still too hateful, ask your colleagues in corporate finance for something better. Mr. Charles, the Ramp product executive, suggests shooting a video showing the amount of time it takes to file an expense report and sending it up the chain with a simple query: "Surely, this doesn't make sense?"
And perhaps those colleagues need to ease up on the controls. SAP Concur, the market leader in expense reporting, is the company that many users love to hate on. Chris Juneau, a senior vice president and the head of product marketing there, has heard it all before.
In fact, he all but invites unsolicited feedback with his Concur luggage tag, which frequently draws commentary from people who spot it.
He dutifully takes their comments to product managers, and what he finds is that user pain has more than a little to do with the number of controls and audit triggers that Concur's customers turn on in the product. In other words, your user experience can depend, in part, on how much risk your colleagues in finance think you represent.
So prove yourself worthy. Don't cheat with the dinner credits. Then, ask the people in finance for a little more grace. Software may never rid you of expense reports entirely, but a bit more trust all around could make the process easier.

Biden Team Tries to Buoy Climate Talks Jolted by U.S. Election: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Negotiators at the summit in Azerbaijan fear that the return of Donald Trump will sap momentum for global climate action.
Diplomats from around the world had planned to gather in Azerbaijan this week to focus squarely on raising the trillions of dollars needed to tackle global warming.
But on Tuesday, at least, this year's United Nations climate change summit was dominated by another topic entirely: the U.S. election and the impending return of Donald J. Trump to the world stage.
When he comes back to the White House in January, Mr. Trump is widely expected to pull out of the Paris climate agreement and renege on America's commitments to cutting greenhouse gas emissions.
That has world leaders and negotiators at the summit wondering how they can possibly strengthen efforts to curb global warming without the support of the planet's wealthiest and most powerful nation.
For the moment, many countries are trying to put on a brave face.
"Success does not depend on one country alone," Yalchin Rafiyev, Azerbaijan's deputy foreign minister and the lead negotiator at the climate summit, said on Tuesday. "It depends on all of us."
Yet many delegates and observers gathered in Baku, Azerbaijan's capital, conceded that the United States' looming retreat in the fight against climate change was a major setback. This year's talks, known as COP29, are aimed at persuading wealthy nations, who have historically pumped the most greenhouse gases into the air, to provide more financial aid to poor countries to adapt to heat waves, droughts and other dangers of climate change.
"It goes without saying that we are in a difficult position," said Ashlee Thomas, a senior policy adviser at Oxfam America, a nonprofit group that is urging rich countries to set a target of $ 1 trillion per year in climate finance. That goal could prove exceedingly difficult without U.S. support.
The Biden administration, which has sent a large team of negotiators to the talks, has been trying to calm jittery nerves by highlighting U.S. efforts over the past four years to slash emissions, with officials arguing that a global transition to cleaner energy sources like wind and solar power is now unstoppable.
Yet in remarks on Monday, John Podesta, the senior U.S. climate diplomat, struck a somber tone.
"For those of us dedicated to climate action, last week's outcome in the United States is obviously bitterly disappointing," Mr. Podesta said. He acknowledged that the frequent swings in America's commitment to tackling climate change were "more difficult to tolerate as the dangers we face grow ever more catastrophic."
But Ali Zaidi, President Biden's national climate adviser, said that international cooperation on climate change had weathered a Trump presidency before and largely survived intact. In 2017, Mr. Trump previously announced that he would pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement.
Over the ensuing four years, Mr. Zaidi said, the World Bank and other financial institutions nevertheless enhanced their financial support for countries coping with climate change. In the United States, wind and solar power continued to expand and power plant emissions fell, despite Mr. Trump's attempts to roll back environmental regulations. Congress also passed a bill in 2020 to phase out hydrofluorocarbons, a potent greenhouse gas.
Once the Biden administration came to power in 2021 and rejoined the Paris pact, the world's richest countries were able to meet an earlier promise to provide $ 100 billion per year in climate aid to poorer countries, Mr. Zaidi said. And, in 2022, Congress ended up passing "the largest investment in clean energy and climate in the history of the world," he added.
"My big-picture view on climate finance is, we've seen not just the United States but other countries zig and zag," Mr. Zaidi said. "When you have a country that was pulling at the back of the pack, someone else is able to pick up the pace."
Some diplomats suggested that Europe could take more of a leadership role on global climate efforts in America's absence.
Jennifer Morgan, Germany's special envoy on climate, pointed out that the European Union had already provided more climate aid to poorer countries than anyone else had, roughly $ 30 billion last year, and was ready to provide more, if other donors stepped up as well.
"The global race for clean industries will continue irrespective of elections," Ms. Morgan said. "Germany and the European Union see the transition to a climate-neutral economy as a cornerstone of our future competitiveness."
Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, announced on Tuesday in Baku that his country would cut emissions 81 percent from 1990 levels by 2035, a step up from an earlier target of 78 percent.
Later, the Spanish president, Pedro Sánchez, said that climate change had fueled the floods that recently ravaged Valencia, which he called "the greatest natural disaster of our history."
Mr. Sánchez said Spain would be carbon neutral by 2050, and called on other countries to accelerate their move away from fossil fuels. "Let us stop dragging our heels and denying science," he said. "Let us save our citizens and save our planet."
Others suggested that China, which now leads the world in solar and wind power, was poised to fill the gap left by the United States.
"We need to admit there is a leadership vacuum left by the change in the White House," said Yuan Ying, a China representative for Greenpeace. "China is leading the way to provide clean-tech solutions on a global scale," she said.
Yet some analysts said that American influence would be tough to replace. While the United States has sometimes exasperated other countries at climate talks with its reluctance to provide financial aid, U.S. diplomats have played key roles in persuading countries like China, which is now the world's biggest polluter, to commit to tougher emissions targets.
"Eliminating the role of the U.S. in encouraging China to commit to a more rapid emissions reduction over the next 10 years, that could have major consequences," said David Waskow, a climate expert at the World Resources Institute. "I think we have to recognize that."
As the climate talks got underway on Monday in a repurposed soccer stadium in Baku, tensions were already on display. Countries spent hours unable to agree on the formal agenda for the summit, a process that is usually routine.
Late on Monday evening, negotiators announced that they had secured a breakthrough by agreeing on long-awaited rules around carbon markets, which allow nations to offset their pollution by paying for projects that reduce emissions in other countries. Yet some groups said that the rules had been rushed through and contained flaws.
On Tuesday, Azerbaijan's president, Ilham Aliyev, criticized wealthier nations that have called on developing countries like his to reduce their fossil fuel production, pointing out that the European Union was still relying on natural gas from his country.
"Unfortunately, double standards, a habit to lecture other countries and political hypocrisy became kind of modus operandi for some politicians, state-controlled N.G.O.s and fake news media in some Western countries," Mr. Aliyev said.
James Marape, the prime minister of Papua New Guinea, said he would refuse to attend the negotiations this year because they had become "meaningless talk fests," unable to provide sufficient funding for countries like his to reduce deforestation.
In an attempt to buoy the talks, Biden administration officials held a joint event with China and Azerbaijan on Tuesday to discuss how to reduce lesser-known but potent greenhouse gases like methane. Mr. Podesta announced that the United States had finalized a new provision that charges oil and gas companies up to $ 1,500 for every ton of methane that leaks from their systems. (Mr. Trump is expected to try to repeal that rule.)
Some environmentalists expressed alarm that nations might use a second Trump administration as an excuse to abandon their climate efforts.
"It's also possible that other countries use the cover of Trump to lessen their ambition," said Dean Bhebhe, a climate activist at Power Shift Africa. "Will the rest of the world follow Trump's lead and just give up on the planet by default?"

A News Media Audience Surge Is Expected. Then What?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: News fatigue and changing consumption habits could sap some of that enthusiasm over time, several news media experts said.
When Donald J. Trump pulled off a surprise victory against Hillary Clinton in 2016, the news media was a major beneficiary, as viewers stayed glued to cable news and readers signed up for newspaper subscriptions in droves.
Eight years later, Mr. Trump's definitive White House victory could lead to another spike of audience interest in the news -- at least in the short term -- numerous experts said.
Cable news ratings, subscriptions to digital news organizations and philanthropic giving will probably increase, as audiences sort through a news-intensive post-election period. But that enthusiasm could wear off in the coming weeks and months as viewers become exhausted by the relentless news cycle.
"Trump 2.0 will likely be a very different administration than we saw before," said Frank Sesno, a professor at George Washington University and a former Washington bureau chief of CNN. "That will carry immense consequences and news value. It will energize right-wing media, and it will panic the left."
The New York Times, The Washington Post and other newspapers saw a sudden influx of subscriptions in 2016 as readers puzzled through the consequences of Mr. Trump's initial victory. Those news organizations capitalized on that surge with ad campaigns embracing new readers and, in the case of The Washington Post, adopting a slogan that underscored a commitment to aggressive reporting: "Democracy Dies in Darkness."
David Clinch, a revenue consultant for Media Growth Partners, a media advisory firm, said that he thought news organizations would see another uptick in customers, but that it would be more muted than in the first Trump administration, because some readers have become fed up with or exhausted by mainstream news coverage.
Mr. Clinch said he expected news organizations to begin fine-tuning marketing campaigns to reach specific readers who might have heightened interest in the news after the election.
That may already be beginning. On Wednesday morning, Vox.com's editor in chief and publisher, Swati Sharma, emailed readers to ask for donations, emphasizing the site's "fearless journalism" and "cleareyed reporting."
Mr. Trump's victory will also probably result in an increase in philanthropic giving to news organizations, especially those that act as watchdogs of powerful political and corporate interests, said Richard Tofel, a former president of ProPublica, an investigative reporting nonprofit.
Mr. Tofel said small donations would most likely increase immediately, with wealthy individuals and especially foundation funders taking time to assess the potential effects that Mr. Trump's term could have on the press, given his relentless criticism of journalists.
"It would depend, I think, on the approach that Trump takes," Mr. Tofel said. "If he maintains the hostility to the press that he was displaying as recently as Monday, I suspect that there will be a surge of major giving from some quarters aimed at defending the press."
But "that might not be the case, at least in the short run," if Mr. Trump's tone is more like his victory speech early Wednesday, Mr. Tofel said.
Other possible beneficiaries of the high-intensity news cycle after Mr. Trump's victory are podcasters and other online creators, who were courted by both Mr. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris during the run-up to the election, said Chris Balfe, the chief executive of Red Seat Ventures, a media company that produces podcasts for figures including the former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly.
Mr. Balfe said Mr. Trump's appearances on podcasts including "The Joe Rogan Experience" and "This Past Weekend With Theo Von," as well as Ms. Harris's appearance on the "Call Her Daddy" podcast, were a sign that the rising power of influential voices outside the mainstream media would only continue growing in the wake of the election.
"Those creators have built really large, loyal audiences," Mr. Balfe said. "Clearly that's where media consumption is going, and, therefore, that's where political candidates need to go to reach that audience."
Even as viewers tune in for the aftermath of the election, traditional TV ratings are in terminal decline, and Mr. Trump's victory is unlikely to alter that predicament, Mr. Sesno, the George Washington University professor, said. Regardless of the short-term viewership boost, news executives need to put their long-term missions before their short-term commercial concerns, or risk alienating their audiences for years to come.
"It's vital that as these channels think about their ratings, they also are thinking profoundly about the public service that they're supposed to play, even in an intensely competitive, private sector-driven marketplace," Mr. Sesno said.

Full text: Rich with browned butter pecans and chewy with oats, these foolproof cookies are the perfect thing to make -- and eat -- while results roll in.
Ahead of the 2020 presidential election, interest in election cake resurfaced from its heyday more than 200 years ago. While mentions of the cake predate the American Revolution, the first-known published recipe is in the 1796 book "American Cookery" by Amelia Simmons. That yeast-risen butter cake called for a pint of wine and quart of brandy, which sounds pretty great.
Election cake is a sturdy dessert that takes days to prepare and lasts for weeks, so it may have been just the thing to prepare while waiting for results. Waiting's the one sure thing in any election, and the same is true of baking. Whatever goes in the oven takes time, and among baked goods, cookies are the least likely to fail.
Cakes require more attention than cookies, the easiest of which call for only dropping dough on a baking sheet. If you're new to baking or distracted while in the kitchen, your cookies will come out fine, even if they're shaped like amoebas. Chocolate chip cookies, invented nearly a century ago by Ruth Wakefield in Massachusetts, seem like the obvious choice, ideal for just about every occasion, but the fleeting high they induce doesn't feel right for Election Day. Instead, these chewy brown butter cookies sustain with a grounded maple sweetness and strata of buttery richness.
Recipe: Chewy Brown Butter Cookies
They're designed for Election Day baking: The recipe can be made in stages (during breaks from watching results roll in), and both raw dough and baked rounds last for weeks in the freezer. They also reflect tastes beloved in America at this moment, chewy and toasty with brown butter and edged with salt, nutty with Southern pecans and autumnal with Northern maple syrup.
When butter cooks long enough for its dairy solids to separate and darken from gold to copper, it develops a savory nuttiness. That flavor is magnified in this dough: Pecans are stirred into the butter as its milky bits turn tan, and both toast to a deep brown. The scent is as warming as a wood fire and lingers nearly as long.
To make sure this pair doesn't burn to bitterness in the residual heat of the pan, oats and salt are stirred in. The butter stops cooking and instead soaks into the oats, seasoning and moistening them.
This blend can, in fact, become even more delicious if made with Elliot pecans, grown predominantly in Georgia. Tubby and round, these squat little nuts have a higher fat content than most other pecans and an almost creamy sweetness.
Fresh, still-yellow butter forms the foundation for the rest of the dough. With its solid emulsion of fat and liquid, it gives the cookies a milky taste and an airy-yet-chewy structure. Pure maple syrup balances that with its depth, all the more so if it's dark and robust.
Jenna Baird and Jacob Powsner, who run the maple syrup business of Baird Farm in Chittenden, Vt., explained that light amber syrup comes from sap early in the season when everything begins to thaw, and dark syrups are from later-season sap.
"It's just a couple of weeks that separate a light amber from a dark amber syrup," Mr. Powsner said. "When you boil a later-season sap, you get a different caramelization."
The seasonal shift in sugars, along with changes in naturally occurring airborne yeast and bacteria that break down the sap, can affect flavor. "There's a lot going on in some of the really dark ones," Ms. Baird said. "Some are almost molasses in flavor. There's an almost bitter aftertaste." That may not be what you want poured onto pancakes, but it will amaze you with its complexity in baked goods.
Given more time in the fridge, this dough evolves to have increasingly nuanced notes of nuts and toffee. But it starts with enough intrigue to bake into delicious cookies right away -- so they can be one thing you don't have to keep waiting for this election season.

At 75, a Florida Farmworker Still Toils Under a Hot Sun: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After two heat strokes and damaged kidneys, José Delgado remains stunned that Florida banned counties from enacting protections for outdoor workers.
The heat stroke that José Delgado suffered six years ago after working in a sweet potato field in South Florida left him with damaged kidneys. It happened again two years later. His doctor, he said, warned that his heart might not survive another episode.
He is 75 now and still waking up at 5:30 a.m. six days a week to labor in the fields, putting his wizened body through more and more days of extreme heat. Last year, the National Weather Service issued heat advisories for Miami-Dade County on 41 days. This year, it has done so on 63 days, most recently on Sept. 30. Over two days in May, the heat index reached 112 degrees Fahrenheit, breaking the previous daily record by 11 degrees.
Mid-October is typically the start of a drier, somewhat cooler period in South Florida. For Mr. Delgado, it is a moment of relief. But it is also a time to reflect on what could have been.
Mr. Delgado used to hope that his story would move policymakers to enact heat protections for outdoor workers. He no longer believes it will.
"They're in cool air all day," he said of lawmakers, his voice tinged with bitterness. "They don't think about who labors to put food on their table."
His first heat stroke came in 2018, when he lost consciousness and had to be hospitalized. The episode inspired WeCount!, an immigrant and worker advocacy group, to campaign for a local law that would require employers to provide water and rest and shade breaks for Miami-Dade County's more than 60,000 agriculture and construction workers on excessively hot days.
Mr. Delgado took a bus from Homestead, Fla., to Miami three times last year to attend public hearings on the proposal. In Miami-Dade County, the heat index -- a measure that considers humidity as well as temperature -- exceeded 100 degrees for 46 consecutive days in 2023, during the state's hottest summer ever.
The proposed protections, which would have been some of the strictest in the country, drew national attention.
But they never took effect. Leaders in the agriculture and construction industries said such rules would create "an unneeded burden to thousands of businesses, a bottomless pit of red tape, lost time and money." A majority of the commissioners signaled that they could not support the rules, even after they were watered down.
The death knell came in April, when Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, signed legislation banning cities and counties from imposing such protections. He argued that it would be unfair to allow different rules in South Florida than in, say, the Florida Panhandle.
Mr. Delgado still cannot believe it.
"I don't understand why they refuse to pass that law," Mr. Delgado said in Spanish in a recent interview in a sweet potato field in Florida City, just north of the Keys, as the heat index hovered around 106 degrees.
At least three male farmworkers -- a 28-year-old placing wooden stakes in the ground to support bell peppers, a 26-year-old planting sugar cane and a 41-year-old harvesting oranges -- died from heat-related illness in Florida last year, according to the most recent data available from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Lack of precise data makes heat deaths difficult to track, but many outdoor workers have experienced the effects of a warming climate on the human body.
Mr. Delgado's last hope is that the Biden administration will implement proposed regulations that would, for the first time, require employers to provide rest areas and water when the heat index reaches 80 degrees. The regulations could apply to about 35 million Americans.
But passing rules takes time, and Mr. Delgado is old.
He began working the land as a 5-year-old in Mexico. His father plowed the fields with oxen, he said.
He came to the United States in 1988 but did not have legal status until December, according to his lawyer, when he received a temporary work permit under a federal program for noncitizens who have been victims of labor law violations. Mr. Delgado worked for a company that had underpaid him and others after misclassifying them as contract workers.
On the day that Mr. Delgado collapsed from his first heat stroke in 2018, he had been suffering from nausea, vision loss and a headache. His second episode, in 2020, began when he felt queasy in the field.
But Mr. Delgado has no choice but to keep working. He makes his way to the fields in his trusty Chevy pickup, his only major possession, with its peeling green paint and dented fender.
He covers himself with long pants, long sleeves, a bandanna and a wide-rimmed hat. Since employers are not required to provide cold water nearby, he packs his own. When he needs shade, he opens a rusty beach umbrella, props it onto the truck bed and lays on the ground.
On the day of the interview, he bent over and cut sweet potato vines using a sugar cane machete that he sheared down to a smaller size. He would get paid $ 1.50 per bunch -- and an additional 75 cents for each of those that he plants in the following days.
Taking a break, he fished an ice cube from his cooler to suck on.
He rents a room in Homestead and tends to the yard. Over the years, he has suffered work-related injuries: He cut off part of a finger, underwent surgery after plant sap went into his eye and needed another surgery after an iron rod pierced his arm when he fell doing construction work.
Tens of thousands of undocumented farmworkers are ineligible for retirement relief, even after decades spent working in the United States. Mr. Delgado has told one of his daughters that soon he will not be able to work anymore and will need someone to support him. But his future remains unresolved.
At night, when his body cools down, everything starts to hurt. He takes 400 milligrams of ibuprofen and waits for some relief.

Full text: About two years ago, when Armando Iannucci began adapting "Dr. Strangelove" for the West End, he didn't think the 1964 movie had many direct parallels to today.
The full title of Stanley Kubrick's film is "Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," and it tells the story of a U.S. Air Force general who goes rogue and orders a nuclear strike on the Soviet Union. In the Pentagon's war room, an ineffectual president (Peter Sellers) dithers, blusters and flails, as he tries to avert World War III.
In the 1960s, the movie became a much-debated hit -- a "nightmare comedy," as Kubrick called it -- at a moment when nuclear annihilation was a common fear. Yet for Iannucci, who created the TV series "Veep," the movie's contemporary relevance was, at first, more metaphorical: The failure to stop atomic catastrophe was akin to society's handling of climate change.
Then, the news took over.
As Iannucci and the director Sean Foley worked on the adaptation, which opens at London's Noël Coward Theater on Oct. 29 and runs through Jan. 25, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia floated the idea of nuclear conflict with the West over its support of Ukraine. China has boosted its nuclear arsenal. And violence in the Middle East has renewed fears around both Iran accelerating its nuclear program and Israel pre-emptively striking Iran's nuclear facilities.
Suddenly, Iannucci recalled in a recent interview in a grand back room of the Noël Coward Theater, his "Dr. Strangelove" felt like "a kind of literal reminder of a real doomsday."
The prospect that a madman might launch a nuclear strike is more plausible today than during the Cold War, Iannucci said, looking exhausted, having just flown back from Los Angeles and the premiere of HBO's "The Franchise." (He is an executive producer of the show.) "The advantage we had in the '60s was everybody was terrified of nuclear war, and thought, 'We must do everything to stop that from happening."' Now, he said, nuclear war doesn't feel real. "It feels like stuff happening on our screens or on our tablets," he added, "but not actually in the world."
"Dr. Strangelove," the first licensed stage adaptation of a Kubrick work, is Iannucci's West End debut, and his reputation as a satirical powerhouse has turned it into one of London's most anticipated new productions.
Over the past 30 years, Iannucci, 60, has become known in Britain for TV shows and movies that have highlighted the vanity, and frequent idiocy, of those in power. With "In the Loop," he parodied the United States and Britain's march to war in Iraq. In "Veep," starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus, he portrayed the vice president's office as a home of blunders, anodyne policies and foul-mouthed insults. And with "The Death of Stalin," he turned the brutality of authoritarianism into the darkest of comedies.
Foley, who is directing "Dr. Strangelove," said that his collaborator was an unlikely face for such sharp-edged comedy. "When you meet him, it's like he could be a bank manager," Foley said. But, he added, no one is better at mocking people in power.
Jesse Armstrong, a longtime collaborator and the creator of "Succession," said that Iannucci, who once considered becoming a priest, had a "strong moral sense," which gives "an angry undergirding" to some of his work. "You feel the force of it," Armstrong said.
Despite that reputation, Iannucci insisted that he wasn't a satirist. "I can see why people say I am," he said, "but I don't personally wake up going, 'What subject shall I satirize today?"'
"I just like making funny things," he said. Whether it's about politics, nuclear war or his fears around time passing, "so be it."
Iannucci's childhood had little in it to suggest he would end up in his current perch. He was born in Glasgow, and his mother was a British Italian hairdresser; his father, an Italian immigrant, was a serial businessman who tried his hand at everything, including kitchen construction and running a pizza factory.
Growing up, Iannucci loved radio comedy shows, including "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," but assumed he would have a serious job, maybe in academia.
He studied English literature at Oxford University, and it was there, Iannucci said, that he tried comedy for the first time, performing absurdist skits including impersonations of capital letters and Scottish soccer teams.
As he recalled those moments, Iannucci suddenly got up from a plush sofa, asked for the name of a Scottish soccer team -- we settled on Queen of the South -- then performed an impression that involved him kneeling down repeatedly, as if mimicking sportsmen posing for a team photo. "My knees are so bad," he said afterward, breathing heavily.
At Oxford, Iannucci spent three years struggling to write a doctorate on the 17th-century poet John Milton, then decided to see if comedy could be a career after all. He joined the BBC and, quickly, created his first hit, "The Day Today," in which a bombastic anchor (Chris Morris) and correspondents (including Steve Coogan, the star of "Dr. Strangelove") reported on fake news items.
Iannucci's move into more overtly political comedy came about almost by accident. In 2004, the BBC asked him to present a documentary about "Yes Minister," a 1980s sitcom focused on an inept senior lawmaker. As he rewatched the show, Iannucci realized its depiction of British politics was "totally out of date," because it showed bureaucrats controlling the levers of powers. Now, he thought, it was foul-mouthed spin doctors who ordered lawmakers about, as the ministers tried to grab the attention of 24-hour news channels, while advisers made up policy on the fly.
Soon, Iannucci was making "The Thick of It," a show that follows a series of hapless government ministers and their teams at the fictitious Department of Social Affairs.
In Britain, that expletive-laden show was a critical hit, including with lawmakers who began referring to it in speeches. Soon, U.S. networks were trying to adapt the show. An initial pilot, for ABC, never aired (it centered on a member of the House of Representatives). Then Iannucci created "Veep" for HBO, in which Selina Meyer, a fictional vice president, ultimately finds herself in power after the president resigns.
Although the show ended in 2019, fans this year flooded social media with "Veep" memes after Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Kamala Harris to run in his stead.
Despite the show's apparent foresight, Iannucci said that "Veep" had little relevance today. Most of the episodes involved Meyer's team panicking because she had said something inappropriate(in a typical episode, Meyer tries to develop a position on abortion that won't offend anyone). Today, Iannucci said, many lawmakers don't worry about making bizarre statements. "If you had to do 'Veep' now, you'd have to rethink the whole dynamic," he said.
Next month, "Veep" could be back in the news if there's an Electoral College tie. (Meyer's presidential run ends in just such a scenario.)
Today, Iannucci, is much more focused on his current show. Kubrick's movie contained enough dialogue for only a 45-minute show, Iannucci said, so he and Foley had gone through Kubrick's scripts and notebooks, and also watched deleted scenes (including a custard-pie fight), to inspire new dialogue.
Much of Kubrick's work, Iannucci said, didn't need changing to give it relevance. In the movie, the rogue general orders his underlings to bomb Russia partly because he believes communists are adding fluoride to America's water supply to "sap and impurify" men's "precious bodily fluids."
"That's not a million miles from 'Bill Gates is putting something in the vaccines to chip our brains,"' Iannucci said.
Still, Iannucci and Foley tweaked parts to nod toward current affairs. In Kubrick's movie, the Russian president -- heard, but never seen -- is a drunk buffoon. In the stage show, he is portrayed as a killer able to reach enemies even inside the Pentagon, something that may resonate with West End audiences, given recent Russian-ordered assassinations in Britain.
Most of Iannucci and Foley's time has been spent simply trying to make a beloved movie work onstage. Challenges have included ensuring Coogan has enough time to change outfits so he can play four roles (two of which are meant to be onstage at the same time), and working out how to include iconic scenes, like one in which an Air Force pilot, waving a cowboy hat, rides a nuclear bomb as it plummets to its target.
Iannucci was still tinkering in the days leading up to the opening. Just before the interview, he had sat in the theater's balcony watching a rehearsal, his phone aglow as he typed notes to himself about lines he wanted to cut and words he wanted to change. During the interview, Iannucci read some of those notes aloud. One was about a profane punchline that needed more buildup. Another note read simply: "Something better for 'Tupperware."'
None of the ideas were about boosting the satire. All were just about being funny.

This Florida Farmworker Is 75 and Still Toiling in the Heat

FLORIDA CITY, Fla. — The heatstroke that José Delgado suffered six years ago after working in a sweet potato field in South Florida left him with damaged kidneys. It happened again two years later. His doctor, he said, warned that his heart might not survive another episode.
He is 75 now and still waking up at 5:30 a.m. six days a week to labor in the fields, putting his wizened body through more and more days of extreme heat. Last year, the National Weather Service issued heat advisories for Miami-Dade County on 41 days. This year, it has done so on 63 days, most recently Sept. 30. Over two days in May, the heat index reached 112 degrees Fahrenheit, breaking the previous record by 11 degrees.
Mid-October is typically the start of a drier, somewhat cooler period in South Florida. For Delgado, it is a moment of relief. But it is also a time to reflect on what could have been.
Delgado used to hope that his story would move policymakers to enact heat protections for outdoor workers. He no longer believes it will.
“They’re in cool air all day,” he said of lawmakers, his voice tinged with bitterness. “They don’t think about who labors to put food on their table.”
His first heatstroke came in 2018, when he lost consciousness and had to be hospitalized. The episode inspired WeCount!, an immigrant and worker advocacy group, to campaign for a local law that would require employers to provide water and rest and shade breaks for Miami-Dade County’s more than 60,000 agriculture and construction workers on excessively hot days.
Delgado took a bus from Homestead, Florida, to Miami three times last year to attend public hearings on the proposal. In Miami-Dade County, the heat index — a measure that considers humidity as well as temperature — exceeded 100 degrees for 46 consecutive days in 2023, during the state’s hottest summer ever.
The proposed protections, which would have been some of the strictest in the country, drew national attention.
But they never took effect. Leaders in the agriculture and construction industries said such rules would create “an unneeded burden to thousands of businesses, a bottomless pit of red tape, lost time and money.” A majority of the commissioners signaled that they could not support the rules even after they were watered down.
The death knell came in April, when Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, signed legislation banning cities and counties from imposing such protections. He argued that it would be unfair to allow different rules in South Florida than in, say, the Florida Panhandle.
Delgado still cannot believe it.
“I don’t understand why they refuse to pass that law,” Delgado said in Spanish in a recent interview in a sweet potato field in Florida City, just north of the Keys, as the heat index hovered around 106 degrees.
At least three male farmworkers — a 28-year-old placing wooden stakes in the ground to support bell peppers, a 26-year-old planting sugar cane and a 41-year-old harvesting oranges — died from heat-related illness in Florida last year, according to the most recent data available from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Lack of precise data makes heat deaths difficult to track, but many outdoor workers have experienced the effects of a warming climate on the human body.
Delgado’s last hope is that the Biden administration will implement proposed regulations that would, for the first time, require employers to provide rest areas and water when the heat index reaches 80 degrees. The regulations could apply to about 35 million Americans.
But passing rules takes time, and Delgado is old.
He began working the land as a 5-year-old in Mexico. His father plowed the fields with oxen, he said.
He came to the United States in 1988 but did not have legal status until December, according to his lawyer, when he received a temporary work permit under a federal program for noncitizens who have been victims of labor law violations. Delgado worked for a company that had underpaid him and others after misclassifying them as contract workers.
On the day that Delgado collapsed from his first heatstroke in 2018, he had been suffering from nausea, vision loss and a headache. His second episode, in 2020, began when he felt queasy in the field.
But Delgado has no choice but to keep working. He makes his way to the fields in his trusty Chevy pickup, his only major possession, with its peeling green paint and dented fender.
He covers himself with long pants, long sleeves, a bandanna and a wide-rimmed hat. Since employers are not required to provide cold water nearby, he packs his own. When he needs shade, he opens a rusty beach umbrella, props it onto the truck bed and lies on the ground.
On the day of the interview, he bent over and cut sweet potato vines using a sugar cane machete that he sheared down to a smaller size. He would get paid $1.50 per bunch — and an additional 75 cents for each of those that he plants in the following days.
Taking a break, he fished an ice cube from his cooler to suck on.
He rents a room in Homestead and tends to the yard. Over the years, he has suffered work-related injuries: He cut off part of a finger, underwent surgery after plant sap went into his eye and needed another surgery after an iron rod pierced his arm when he fell doing construction work.
Tens of thousands of farmworkers in the country without legal permission are ineligible for retirement relief, even after decades spent working in the United States. Delgado has told one of his daughters that soon he will not be able to work anymore and will need someone to support him. But his future remains unresolved.
At night, when his body cools down, everything starts to hurt. He takes 400 milligrams of ibuprofen and waits for some relief.

An Old-Style Tear-Jerker Gussied Up With Jump Cuts: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Florence Pugh and Andrew Garfield star in this weepie romance that tries to be modern by unfolding over three intersecting timelines.
Time doesn't stand still in "We Live in Time," an old-fashioned weepie about love and heartache; it jitters and jumps, restlessly shifting back and forth. Set in contemporary Britain, the story follows Almut (Florence Pugh) and Tobias (Andrew Garfield) over a half-decade or so as their relationship develops around familiar milestones. They fall into bed and then into love, move in together and have a child, all while celebrating triumphs and weathering tragedies. As the years pass, they grow older, naturally, but their story is somewhat more complicated than most only because it unfolds out of chronological order.
It's a clever conceit that suggests how we experience the passage of time and, in the more successful interludes, conveys how the past, present and future inform one another. Early on, Almut whips up some eggs before waking Tobias in a sun-drenched bedroom in their picture-perfect country home. In a following sequence -- which turns out to be set years before -- he jolts awake in their darkened London flat and checks on the heavily pregnant Almut. Each awakening is connected by the couple's love and ministering tenderness; intentionally or not, the scenes also signal that this movie has a real thing for eggs, fertilized and not.
Written by Nick Payne and directed by John Crowley, "We Live in Time" is set during three time periods -- one lasts several years, another six months and the third about a day -- that have been minced and mixed together. The transitions between the different times are blunt and, at first, they're a touch disorienting because they don't come with the usual prompts; there are no rapidly turning calendar pages or characters mistily announcing, "I remember ...." Instead, the filmmakers keep you grounded in the separate eras partly through Tobias and Almut's changing hairstyles, as well as through the birth of their daughter, Ella (Grace Delaney), who grows from a topic of discussion into a charming little kid.
Even as the filmmakers shuffle the couple's different epochs around in a nonlinear fashion, time demands its due, as it must. As Almut and Tobias settle in for the long haul, more than just their hair changes. Almut, who quickly proves the richer character, undergoes significant transformations, including professionally as she goes from cooking in a small restaurant to presiding over a large staff in her own Michelin-starred place. Fairly early on, she and Tobias also receive the grim news from a doctor that her ovarian cancer has returned. It's a jolt; it is the first indication that she's been ill, and it's also clear that the bad news will keep on coming.
For the most part, Pugh and Garfield are pleasantly watchable, and they fit together persuasively enough to convey their characters' mutual attraction. That's the case even if Almut is more convincingly fleshed out than Tobias, who, as the story continues, can seem like both an obstacle and an appendage to this complicated woman. Almut doesn't just give birth and fall gravely ill -- which is already a lot for any one character -- she's far more professionally engaged than Tobias, who's as bland as his job (for a cereal company) sounds. It's an underwritten, reactive role that, particularly as Almut's health crisis worsens, finds Garfield too often leaning on his talent for flooding his big, beseeching eyes with tears.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Almut's ambitions give her spark and grit, and they make the character appealingly contemporary, as does Pugh's vibrancy and emotionally charged performance. The actress handles the shifting periods and deepening drama adroitly, even when the filmmakers begin selling out her character. Among other irritations, they turn Almut's hard-won identity as a chef into a problem, one that comes to a head when she enters a competition that may sap her strength. Almut tells Tobias that she worries what kind of legacy she'll leave Ella, never mind that she's internationally recognized already. That she -- or any woman -- would want to keep working because it's meaningful to her doesn't seem to have dawned on the filmmakers.
Watching Almut's struggles reminded me of an essay that my colleague Zachary Woolfe, the classical music critic for The New York Times, recently wrote about how suffering women remain fixtures even in present-day operas. "This points to perhaps the central challenge of making contemporary opera," he wrote, which is "the tension that arises from fitting old forms, structures and tropes to modern subject matter and mores." He could have been writing about movies like this. Despite its gestures at the difficulties that women face while navigating the complexities and contradictions of life, "We Live in Time" turns Almut into yet another beatifically suffering woman -- and she doesn't even get a damn aria to gloriously go out on.

Fighting Traditional Patriarchy in Myanmar by Focusing on Men-Only Panels: [Correction]

Author: Hölzl, Verena

Full text: Ying Lao has called out the pro-democracy movement for its frequent "manels," arguing that the exclusion of women from such discussions is hurting the cause.
A panel discussion in Myanmar about female leadership had two speakers. Both were male.
Another talk, about how to stay safe from the military government's deadly bombing campaign against civilians, featured four men and no women.
Yet another, an event to raise funds for rebel forces, gathered more than a dozen speakers online, all of them men.
Over the past four years, Ying Lao has documented scores of "manels" -- all-male panels -- organized by the pro-democracy movement in Myanmar. To her, this exclusion of women is evidence of the deeply ingrained sexism in the country, formerly known as Burma. This suppression of women, she added, is also hurting the yearslong battle to oust Myanmar's military rulers.
"Unless we are effectively fighting the patriarchy, we will never defeat the military," said Ms. Ying Lao, who runs the Salween Institute for Public Policy, a Myanmar-focused think tank. "This is the time to be fighting all sorts of oppression."
Part of the large Burmese diaspora in Chiang Mai, Thailand, Ms. Ying Lao has long worked for democratic and feminist causes. But she has faced a backlash for her public evisceration of manels and her demand that at least 30 percent of every panel be female. Some critics have implied that attacking opposition figures makes her complicit with the military.
A few manelists, or members of all-male panels, have vowed to change. Not all of them have made good on that promise.
With the exception of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar's former civilian leader, the country's politics have been dominated by men. She was the only female member of her administration, which came to power during a brief period of civilian rule before the generals again seized power in February 2021. The coup also brought back the patriarchal order the conservative military had imposed for decades.
One aspect of that order is the tradition of hpoun, a belief that asserts that men possess greater spiritual power than women. It often keeps women from rising in society.
But women have been at the forefront of the struggle against the junta. They have marched in peaceful protests. They strung up their sarongs over streets as shields because many men fear that walking under them will sap their virility. Women have rejected cultural norms by picking up weapons against the military. And they have suffered sexual violence perpetrated by the military for decades.
Not all segments of Burmese society see women as inferior to men. The shadow government, the pro-democracy movement's alternative to the junta, has promised gender equality in its charter. But women make up only one-fifth of its cabinet. And on the panel circuit, they are still left out in favor of male politicians, journalists, activists and civil society leaders.
"Some of them would tell you they are feminists," Ms. Ying Lao said.
She realized how manels proliferated during the pandemic, when people hopped online to discuss Myanmar's 2020 election, the results of which were rejected by the generals. Since then, she has documented more than 150 panels that did not include a single woman speaker.
Initially, Ms. Ying Lao challenged manelists and organizers in private. When her concerns were dismissed, she went public.
Now she and a handful of other female activists call out every manel they come across with a campaign they call Burma's Manels Watch. Both the organizers and the manelists are the targets of their ire.
"They made us look like criminals," said Maui Phoe Thaike, the deputy commander of the Karenni Nationalities Defense Force, a militia fighting against the military. He got upset about being among dozens of men featured on a Manels Watch poster. An angry Facebook post he wrote against the group then unleashed a flood of misogynist comments by his followers. He later said that he felt sorry about the incident.
As the country has sunk deeper into civil war, rights activists fear the militarization of society could further exclude women from public discourse.
Lin Htet Aung, a former military captain who defected after the coup, was identified as a manelist by Manels Watch and has threatened to sue the campaign.
"There are topics specifically related to men, and that's why we sometimes see manels," he said. Referring to Manels Watch, he added, "They tarnish our image in front of the world."
For International Women's Day in March 2023, Ms. Ying Lao arranged an exhibition in Chiang Mai. Its tagline declared: "A manel a day keeps democracy away."
Visitors gazed at screenshots and pictures of hundreds of manelists staring at them from posters. There was a bingo board showcasing common excuses used by manel organizers to explain the lack of female voices ("We couldn't find any women experts") and advice on what to do when invited to an event with no female experts ("Let your no-manels policy be known and ask organizers who the other speakers are in advance").

Last October, Ms. Ying Lao and her team invited gender equality activists from Indonesia and Thailand to join them and took the exhibit to Bangkok.
Because of her confrontational approach, Ms. Ying Lao has been described as "too much" or "fixated." Her colleagues reject that criticism as sexist.

Fighting Myanmar’s Patriarchy, One All-Male Panel at a Time

CHIANG MAI, Thailand — A panel discussion in Myanmar about female leadership had two speakers. Both were male.
Another talk, about how to stay safe from the military government’s deadly bombing campaign against civilians, featured four men and no women.
Yet another, an event to raise funds for rebel forces, gathered more than a dozen speakers online, all of them men.
Over the past four years, Ying Lao has documented scores of “manels” — all-male panels — organized by the pro-democracy movement in Myanmar. To her, this exclusion of women is evidence of the deeply ingrained sexism in the country, formerly known as Burma. This suppression of women, she added, is also hurting the yearslong battle to oust the Myanmar’s military rulers.
“Unless we are effectively fighting the patriarchy, we will never defeat the military,” said Ying Lao, who runs the Salween Institute for Public Policy, a Myanmar-focused think tank. “This is the time to be fighting all sorts of oppression.”
Part of the large Burmese diaspora in Chiang Mai, Thailand, Ying Lao has long worked for democratic and feminist causes. But she has faced a backlash for her public evisceration of manels and her demand that at least 30% of every panel be female. Some critics have implied that attacking opposition figures makes her complicit with the military.
A few manelists, or members of all-male panels, have vowed to change. Not all of them have made good on that promise.
With the exception of Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s former civilian leader, the country’s politics have been dominated by men. She was the only female member of her administration, which came to power during a brief period of civilian rule before the generals again seized power in February 2021. The coup also brought back the patriarchal order the conservative military had imposed for decades.
One aspect of that order is the tradition of hpoun, a belief that asserts that men possess greater spiritual power than women. It often keeps women from rising in society.
But women have been at the forefront of the struggle against the junta. They have marched in peaceful protests. They strung up their sarongs over streets as shields because many men fear that walking under them will sap their virility. Women have rejected cultural norms by picking up weapons against the military. And they have suffered sexual violence perpetrated by the military for decades.
Not all segments of Burmese society see women as inferior to men. The shadow government, the pro-democracy movement’s alternative to the junta, has promised gender equality in its charter. But women make up only one-fifth of its Cabinet. And on the panel circuit, they are still left out in favor of male politicians, journalists, activists and civil society leaders.
“Some of them would tell you they are feminists,” Ying Lao said.
She realized how manels proliferated during the pandemic, when people hopped online to discuss Myanmar’s 2020 election, the results of which were rejected by the generals. Since then, she has documented more than 150 panels that did not include a single woman speaker.
Initially, Ying Lao challenged manelists and organizers in private. When her concerns were dismissed, she went public.
Now, she and a handful of other female activists call out every manel they come across with a campaign they call Burma’s Manels Watch. Both the organizers and the manelists are the targets of their ire.
“They made us look like criminals,” said Maui Phoe Thaike, deputy commander of the Karenni Nationalities Defense Force, a militia fighting against the military. He got upset about being among dozens of men featured on a Manels Watch poster. An angry Facebook post he wrote against the group then unleashed a flood of misogynist comments by his followers. He later said that he felt sorry about the incident.
As the country has sunk deeper into civil war, rights activists fear the militarization of society could further exclude women from public discourse.
Lin Htet Aung, a former military captain who defected after the coup, was identified as a manelist by Manels Watch and has threatened to sue the campaign.
“There are topics specifically related to men, and that’s why we sometimes see manels,” he said. Referring to Manels Watch, he added, “They tarnish our image in front of the world.”
For International Women’s Day in March 2023, Ying Lao arranged an exhibition in Chiang Mai. Its tagline declared: “A manel a day keeps democracy away.”
Visitors gazed at screenshots and pictures of hundreds of manelists staring at them from posters. There was a bingo board showcasing common excuses used by manel organizers to explain the lack of female voices (“We couldn’t find any women experts”) and advice on what to do when invited to an event with no female experts (“Let your no-manels policy be known and ask organizers who the other speakers are in advance”).
Ying Lao received sexist hate mail, among them messages that she interpreted as threats.
Last October, Ying Lao and her team invited gender equality activists from Indonesia and Thailand to join them and took the exhibit to Bangkok.
Because of her confrontational approach, Ying Lao has been described as “too much” or “fixated.” Her colleagues reject that criticism as sexist.
“If a man is acting like this, they say he’s decisive and principled,” said Nang Moet Moet, general secretary of the Women’s League of Burma, which co-sponsored the exhibitions. “For women, they say we are aggressive.”

Full text: Our 50 favorite places in America right now.
We have finished our annual search for America's best restaurants.
Over the last 12 months, reporters and editors traveled to nearly every state scouting restaurants for our annual list. This year, it was about spaces as much as places. We ate hyperlocal dishes served out of a trailer in a rural Virginia field, experienced one of America's most refined seasonal tasting menus in one of San Francisco's most refined rooms, dined on Creole fare in a strip mall down the road from NASA in Texas and joined a party behind a tattered ranch house in Johns Island, S.C.
Of our choices, 32 are new, opened since the 2023 list was assembled. But we also made space for longstanding restaurants still in top form, including one that opened in 1976. As always, there were no-brainers and tough choices -- the United States has a vast, diverse spread of great restaurants these days -- but these are our 50 favorites for 2024. BRIAN GALLAGHER
Mr. Baan's Bar and Mookata
Phoenix Thai Opened November 2023 mrbaans.com
Three things to know: You will need an appetite. You will be better off with a big group. And you will want cocktails. One of only three restaurants in the United States that serves the mookata style of Thai cooking -- the other two are in Queens and San Francisco -- Mr. Baan's is the next-door sibling to Phoenix's acclaimed Lom Wong. The mookata setup is a dome-shaped charcoal-fired grill on which you cook your own soy-marinated pork, coriander beef or black-pepper chicken. Surrounding the dome is a moat filled with already rich pork broth that is further fortified by the meat drippings. To this, you add noodles, minced pork, vegetables, mushrooms and various sauces to create a soup of your own specifications, hot-pot style. It's a party, and, never fear, refills on all elements are included. BRIAN GALLAGHER
Quince
San Francisco Seasonal Tasting Menu Opened 2003, Reopened 2023 quincerestaurant.com
After more than 20 years, dinner at Michael and Lindsay Tusk's Quince is still a master class in the NorCal culinary vernacular. The produce, much of it grown 30 miles up the coast in Bolinas, is superb. And naturally, the menu changes with the seasons. But Mr. Tusk's dishes -- a roasted spiny lobster with black trumpet mushrooms and fava greens, for instance, or sunchoke velouté with a local oyster, chanterelles and sorrel -- are a deft balance of cheffing and sourcing. The recently redesigned space feels at once contemporary and timeless. The elegantly spare décor and widely spaced tables are de rigueur for a three-Michelin-starred restaurant, but the dining room is warmed by Ms. Tusk's presiding presence. Dinner is an expensive occasion at $ 390 a person (though you can have a four-course lunch for $ 175). But when you imagine a perfect California fine-dining restaurant, you're imagining Quince. You just may not know it until you eat there. BRIAN GALLAGHER
Four Kings
San Francisco Cantonese American Opened March 2024 itsfourkings.com
Four Kings is breathing much-needed fire into San Francisco's dining scene. The chefs Franky Ho and Mike Long, from the acclaimed Mister Jiu's, and their partners Millie Boonkokua and Lucy Li have conjured a restaurant where the surgical precision of their fine-dining past flows as an undercurrent. But the spot-on vibes and energetic dishes are singular here. Nuggets of XO escargot are tucked into shells blanketed with a buttery sheen, served with pillowy milk bread. Sichuan cabbage presents as deceivingly simple on the menu, but surprises as one of the best dishes thanks to a generous dusting of scallion powder. And that's what Four Kings will do: grab you in a way that's bold, exhilarating and needed. ELEANORE PARK
Fikscue
Alameda, Calif. Texas Barbecue, Indonesian Opened November 2023 fikscue.com
When the married couple Reka and Fik Saleh opened their brick storefront, Fikscue, last November, their clientele -- devoted since the pandemic-pop-up days -- followed swiftly across the Bay, where halal Texas-style barbecue and Indonesian cuisine coalesce. Ms. Saleh deftly weaves together the electric brightness and texture of Indonesia's underrepresented cuisine with the stalwart comfort of barbecue. The meltingly tender, jiggly brisket and smoked dino ribs alone are worth the nearly two-hour wait to eat here. But Indonesian dishes -- like the Sumatran beef noodle soup, batagor, where beef ribs slowly simmer in a pool of lemongrass, makrut lime leaves and galangal, and the balado plate of smoked fried chicken nested under a sauce punched up with fermented heat -- round out a menu unlike anything else in the country. ELEANORE PARK
Camélia
Los Angeles Japanese, French Opened July 2024 cameliadtla.com
A delicately crunchy slice of ham katsu, enrobed in Mornay sauce, rests on a slice of sweet, buttery house-made shokupan, almost entirely hidden by a softly fried egg. Even the basic croque-madame here is a thoughtfully composed thrill. Charles Namba and Courtney Kaplan, known for their sake-focused Japanese restaurants, have opened a chic, freewheeling bistro that almost feels as if it were imported from the 11th Arrondissement, but has a distinctly Los Angeles flavor. It's an ideal spot to meet for an aperitif and an aioli garni, but even better to make a long and winding dinner out of its hits. Take the tomatoes and burrata (yawn!) scattered here with fried shiso leaves and a habit-forming ponzu jelly, so soft and delicate that it becomes the dressing. This is the magic of a good bistro: a place where you can come across the familiar, and even predictable, and fall in love with it again. TEJAL RAO
Azizam
Los Angeles Iranian Opened March 2024 azizamla.com
With all due respect to grilled meat on skewers, Cody Ma and Misha Sesar have been using the hashtag #notjustkebabs since they started Azizam as a pop-up in 2021, determined to expand the idea of Iranian food in Los Angeles. Their casual Silver Lake cafe is devoted to the kind of deeply delicious, often labor-intensive cooking that doesn't like to show off about how much prep (a lot) goes into it. The kitchen bakes nigella seed-freckled barbari each day for its sandwiches, which might be filled with sliced beef tongue or herb-packed kuku sabzi. Stay for a bigger meal, and the rewards are bigger, too: The kofteh Tabrizi is a single, family-size, fruit-studded meatball in tangy broth. The ash-e-jo -- an unassuming jewel based on Mr. Ma's mother's recipe -- is a luxuriously slippery rendition of the stew, stacked with barley, lentils, kidney beans and chickpeas, and crowned with caramelized onions and fried mint. It tastes like being home, no matter where you're from. TEJAL RAO
Yuan Wonton
Denver Chinese Opened September 2023 instagram.com/yuanwonton
After four years as a beloved food truck, the chef Penelope Wong's dumpling operation found a brick-and-mortar home last year. Part of the joy here is the variety of choices, several of which rotate. There are Hong Kong-style "YW OG" wontons in Sichuan chile oil, tom kha chicken wontons, Chinese chive pockets and steamed chashu pork bao. All are expertly constructed with handmade doughs. Much of the rest of the menu changes as well, but on one visit, the hero was the jok, a Chinese congee with chicken and a warming, nervy duet of ginger and pickled bird's-eye chile that made the dish hum. BRIAN GALLAGHER
Sap Sua
Denver Modern Vietnamese Opened 2023 sapsua.com
Since the husband-and-wife team Anna and Ni Nguyen opened what they call their "nontraditional Vietnamese restaurant," they have been stacking accolades, including best new restaurant mentions from national media and a James Beard semifinalist nod for the same. All well deserved. Their trứng và trứng alone would warrant the praise. Described simply as "soft scrambled egg, brown butter, fish sauce, trout roe, rice," the dish coaxes the humble egg into an improbably rich, custardy realm. And the rest of the menu does not disappoint. Skeins of mint, chiles and ginger run through dishes that play on traditional Vietnamese preparations, but still taste wholly original. Booking at prime dinner hour can still be tricky, though not as Sisyphean as it once was. BRIAN GALLAGHER
Meander Eatery
Pagosa Springs, Colo. New American, Farm-to-Table Opened 2022 meandereatery.com
Tucked into the southern reaches of the San Juan Mountains, Meander is a gem of a country restaurant. The chef Justin Jacobs spent time in the kitchen at Frasca, in Boulder, among the region's most renowned restaurants, but has left the white-tablecloth life behind. The menu here is unapologetically eclectic, with quality ingredients, especially produce, and sure-handed cooking keeps it coherent. A Dutch baby topped with a creamy lump crab meat mixture made a novel twist on breakfast for dinner, while a "patio smoked" bratwurst, made in house, was a deftly spiced version of that quintessential cased meat. Particularly on a warm evening, a table on the back deck is the perfect place to have dinner and watch the San Juan River, well, meander by. BRIAN GALLAGHER
The Shipwright's Daughter
Mystic, Conn. Seafood, American Opened 2020 shipwrightsdaughter.com
Mystic is your classic New England tourist town, well provisioned with fudge, ice cream and, famously, pizza. But it's also becoming a dining destination, with two innovative bar-restaurants from the chef Renee Touponce and this refined but deceptively casual-looking entry from David Standridge, who won this year's James Beard award for Best Chef: Northeast. His website's paean to sustainability and local seafood (including undervalued species like sea robin, green crab and limpets) is more than backed up by dishes like velvety roasted oysters and a delicate batter-fried fillet of whiting. But the highlights here range far beyond the sea: inventive pastas built around the produce of the moment, an exemplary roast chicken and the crispy pig's head, a voluptuous take on tête de veau that should become a tourist attraction in itself. PATRICK FARRELL
Walrus Rodeo
Miami Modern Italian Opened 2022 walrusrodeo.com
A slice of lasagna at Walrus Rodeo is thin, with a dark, charred surface. From a distance it looks like a healthy serving of parmigiana. Forkfuls reveal wilted mustard greens, tangy stracchino, lamb ragù hinting of moussaka. The food here toys with your expectations in this way, with dishes that look familiar, only to reveal flavors you didn't predict. Servers mash carrot tartare, bound by espuma and salsa verde, as soon as it lands on the table; charred long beans hold dollops of lemon curd. The staff will make you feel lucky to be part of the scene unfolding nightly in this unassuming Little Haiti strip mall. And while the restaurant lives up to its "not just a pizzeria" tagline, you should order at least one pie. BRETT ANDERSON
La Camaronera
Miami Cuban Seafood Opened 1976 lacamaronera.com
La Camaronera's pan con minuta is a sandwich containing a whole gutted fried snapper, minus the head but including the tail. It's more fish than the lightly toasted Cuban roll can contain. The sandwich, the most popular order at this 50-plus-year-old Little Havana seafood joint, is both hard to miss and hard to resist. The qualities that make it so delicious -- notably the fried-to-order crispness of the fresh fish -- are found across the menu, which contains some of the South's best fried seafood and more. That great-looking hogfish for sale at the retail counter? Order a skin-on fillet of it grilled, with a side of black-eyed-pea fritters. BRETT ANDERSON
Bread & Butterfly
Atlanta French, Haitian Opened August 2023 bread-and-butterfly.com
After a series of pop-ups, Demetrius Brown quietly took over a much-loved French cafe and transformed dinner into a showcase for French cuisine as interpreted by Caribbean cooks, particularly from Haiti. Cilantro, thyme and epis, the herbaceous spice blend, perfume a delicate interpretation of the classic beef patty. In the same way, Mr. Brown uses English peas and local mushrooms to enhance djon-djon, a dish named after a type of Haitian mushroom. He marinates halibut for escovitch, and marries single-origin Haitian chocolate with coconut ice cream. The kitchen-driven cocktail list gets a special nod, especially nonalcoholic surprises made with snap pea juice and matcha. If more traditional French food is what you had in mind, there are always the lunch and breakfast menus. KIM SEVERSON
Nàdair
Atlanta Scottish, Southern Opened May 2024 nadairatl.com
Nàdair is the Scottish-Southern mash-up no one knew American dining needed. It's the latest and most personal restaurant from Kevin Gillespie, the red-bearded chef who became a star in the early seasons of "Top Chef." With a carpet woven in the colors of his family's tartan and a pocketful of his Scottish granny's recipes, you'd think the place would be a stodgy tribute to oats and haggis. It's anything but. Yes, there is haggis, but it's a clever vegetarian version in crisp pastry with peated whiskey cream and mushroom velouté. A tender cornmeal crust gives a Scottish cheese and onion pie a Georgia kiss. Lacquered pork shoulder that takes a couple of weeks to cure and smoke arrives with a collard-green dumpling. A small plate with fancy twists on sweet Scottish classics like tablet candy and snowball cookies sends you off into the Atlanta night. KIM SEVERSON
Asador Bastian
Chicago Basque Opened 2023 asadorbastian.com
It is no small thing to call this chophouse's steak the best in Chicago. But it's hard to argue with the evidence, be it a bone-in rib-eye of Galician beef, rimmed with yellow fat, or a cut of dry-aged Holstein that all but instructs you to order an old Rioja Gran Reserva (there are some good ones). Now consider that those steaks have to fight for supremacy with seafood from the plancha and even a simple tortilla, albeit crowned with a ribbon of nutty jamón. You know how New York carnivores can't get enough of neo-brasseries like Frenchette and Minetta Tavern? Asador Bastian is kind of like that, only Basque, and in the city that was once the meatpacking capital of the world. BRETT ANDERSON
North of Bourbon
Louisville, Ky. Modern Cajun-Creole Opened 2021 northofbourbon.com
Lawrence Weeks is among a growing cadre of chefs breathing fresh life into New Orleans cuisine with restaurants outside Louisiana. He does so with cunning refinements to common dishes. Things like fried catfish set under a drift of chopped Haitian pikliz, and crab dressing sparked by cilantro and lime. The gumbo is as dark and enticing as what you'll find in Cajun Country, only thick with smoked brisket and wilted greens. North of Bourbon established Mr. Weeks as one of the region's most exciting new chefs. A similar dynamism is on display at Enso, which opened last year, where the chef looks beyond Louisiana with food that blends Southern and Japanese cuisine. BRETT ANDERSON
Acamaya
New Orleans Mexican Opened July 2024 acamayanola.com
The food at Acamaya falls into roughly two categories. There are the dishes that send your eyebrows upward at first sight, like the painterly aguachile or the arroz negro topped with mussels that look like a display of emeralds. And there are the dishes that don't appear far removed from what you'd find on a grandmother's stove in Mexico City (at least until you take your first bite), like the luxuriously rich acoyote beans or chochoyotes, thick with Louisiana lump crab meat. Ana Castro, already one of the most gifted young chefs in New Orleans, really finds her voice at this stylish, seafood-focused restaurant, which she owns with her sister Lydia. It's food that excites the mind while aiming for your heart. BRETT ANDERSON
Zeeland Street
Baton Rouge, La. Southern, Cajun-Creole Opened 1992 zeelandstreet.com
Casual restaurants known through much of the South as meat-and-threes are more commonly identified as plate-lunch places in south Louisiana. Zeeland Street is a paragon of the form. The chef-owner, Stephanie Phares, learned to cook while growing up in Mississippi, where her grandmother Rachel Drain taught her scratch recipes using fresh ingredients. She's been honing those techniques for more than 30 years at Zeeland Street, where the food tastes as you would expect it to in this swampy corner of Louisiana, roughly halfway between flavor-proud New Orleans and Lafayette. Even the most familiar dishes in Ms. Phares's deep repertoire of soul-soothing staples -- from the eat-with-a-spoon smothered chicken to the gently cooked, notably meatless vegetable sides -- tastes of the kitchen's pride in preparation. BRETT ANDERSON
The Alna Store
Alna, Maine Farm-to-Table Opened 2022 thealnastore.com
On a rural crossroads covered in white clapboard, the Alna Store looks like the old-time country shop that it was for decades. But now, the shelves in back are stocked with natural wines, imported tinned fish and bracing housemade ferments (kimchi, hot sauce, curry kraut). And in front, an ambitious restaurant serves a thoroughly of-the-moment, local menu that's full of sophisticated touches without being at all pretentious. The house margarita is made with mezcal; the buttermilk wedge salad is dusted with crispy fried shallots and capers; and the shrimp topping a mound of creamy grits are coated in warm, fragrant spices, then seared until caramelized. The place is also open for brunch -- a great option if you'd prefer to take a long drive to Midcoast Maine during daylight hours. MELISSA CLARK
Ammoora
Baltimore Syrian Opened 2023 ammoora.com
Jay Salkini, the owner of this ambitious, elegant restaurant in a somewhat corporate condominium complex, and Dima Al-Chaar, the chef, want diners to taste the enchanting, multidimensional sorts of foods they grew up eating in Syria. For anyone steeped in generic Middle Eastern takeout staples, Ammoora will be a revelation. Dishes like muhammara (roasted red peppers seasoned with chile and pomegranate molasses) and kebbet karaz (minced lamb with tart cherry sauce, cinnamon and pine nuts) achieve a thrilling balance of sweet and sour, spicy and breezy. Another dish, kofta kawaj (spiced ground lamb with sweet eggplant and onions in a tomato sauce) builds in complexity and flavor as you eat. Even a familiar hummus or baklava can make you feel as if your eyes have been opened, revealing vivid new colors. ERIC ASIMOV
Somaek
Boston Korean Opened March 2024 somaek.com
In a minimalist space on a quiet side street in busy Downtown Crossing, Somaek presents Korean home cooking in all its magnificence and abundance. Chefs often say their mothers taught them to cook, but Jamie Bissonnette's jangmonim (wife's mother), Soon Han, gets full menu credit for its focused flavors. Alongside robust classics like chilled pork belly, seared beef and stir-fried squid with rice cakes, Soamaek serves a master class in banchan like chive-garlic salad, radish kimchi and pickled perilla leaf. The restaurant is named after a cold fizz of soju (clear liquor) and maekju (beer), popular for chugging and on Korean reality shows; it's just part of a full and festive bar program here. Mr. Bissonnette, a veteran of Boston's fine-dining kitchens (and the tapas juggernaut that was Toro), has built his dream chef cave, with a vinyl listening bar next door and a sushi speakeasy downstairs. JULIA MOSKIN
Noori Pocha
Clawson, Mich. Korean Opened August 2023 nooripocha.com
Walk through the door of Noori Pocha, and you'll wonder if you've found a portal to South Korea without the jet lag. Here you are, on set in Seoul, surrounded by the facades of a bus station and a market. K-pop is on the sound system, and the platters before you bear heaping, steaming plates of bulgogi, chicken buldak and jokbal. The restaurant's name comes from the Korean food carts -- pojangmacha, or pocha -- that cater to the after-work crowd with the types of dishes that sit well with a belly filled with soju. The owner In Yeol Kwon runs a franchise of the Korean fried chicken chain Noori next door, but Noori Pocha is something wholly different, with a menu from the chef Bak Sanghwan and Mr. Kwon's sister, Nali. It's rare for a restaurant to be this transporting, and rarer still to have a meal that's this much fun. SARA BONISTEEL
Oro by Nixta
Minneapolis Mexican Opened 2023 nixtampls.com
This restaurant grew out of the takeout place that itself was the offshoot of a tortilleria instrumental in elevating the quality of tacos across the Twin Cities. The common denominator of all these businesses: a passion for nixtamalized corn. Made from a multihued array of heirloom corn varieties, the supple tortillas and tamales are not inert vessels. They're the base of a menu that the chef Gustavo Romero, who owns Oro by Nixta with his wife, Kate, builds out with braised and roasted meats, in-season produce and an impressive repertoire of moles, salsas and other sauces. Imagine a taqueria with a tasting-menu restaurant's ambitions, and none of its pretensions. BRETT ANDERSON
Vinai
Minneapolis Hmong Opened July 2024 vinaimn.com
Vinai takes its name from a refugee camp in Thailand where the chef-owner Yia Vang was born, and to which his family, along with tens of thousands of fellow Hmong people, fled genocide and war. That somber story comes to life at a restaurant that is, above all else, ebullient, thanks in no small part to the affable presence of Mr. Vang. Hmong cuisine shares characteristics with the food of Thailand, Laos and Vietnam. The chef's personal take on it is arresting, packed with chile and citrus, often streaked with wood smoke, and always suffused with back story. Vinai isn't the only exciting new local restaurant showcasing the cuisine of Minnesota's sizable Hmong community. Diane's Place, a terrific, Hmong American bakery and cafe, is a short walk away.

Sweet Amalia Market & Kitchen
Newfield, N.J. Seafood, Sandwiches Opened 2021 sweetamalia.com
It's a farm-to-table restaurant. OK, the farm in question is an oyster-growing aquaculture operation more than 25 miles away in the Delaware Bay, but still. The place is set up like any other South Jersey roadside farm stand where you might buy a carton of eggs, a bunch of radishes and a basket of strawberries. This farm stand, though, has a raw bar, and naturally, the oysters are exceptional. There's also a counter where you can order casual, colorful plates of whatever happens to have caught the eye of Melissa McGrath, the chef, that week: a towering BLT piled with heirloom tomatoes; falafel over cucumbers and juicy yellow Sungolds; grilled eggplant sandwiches with peperonata. Certain standbys remain no matter the month, like the fried oysters on a grilled buttered roll and the Italian cold-cut hoagies. When your food is ready, you take it to one of the picnic tables outside. PETE WELLS
Blanca
New York City Tasting Menu Opened 2012, Reopened January 2024 blancanyc.com
Blanca, in Brooklyn, is the closest thing you'll find to an avant-garde restaurant among New York's tasting counters, most of which seem to make a religion of playing it safe. Not that Victoria Blamey's cooking is particularly experimental or confrontational, but it is complex and, at times, challenging. Other restaurants will juice yuzu for a precise dose of acidity; Ms. Blamey turns it into a potent sauerkraut that she drapes over clams. Blanca will fill your head with strong flavors in ways that other places charging these prices (dinner costs $ 275 and lasts about three hours) seem afraid to do. Even gentler ingredients can make your head spin: The creamy sauce for king crab grilled over charcoal is speckled with vanilla seeds, and the snails wrapped in bundles of fresh pasta are seasoned with lavender. PETE WELLS
Penny
New York City Seafood Opened March 2024 penny-nyc.com
Almost all the seating at Penny is at a long marble seafood counter broken in two. The section up front is the raw bar, where fresh oysters and clams are popped open; pink sheets of tuna are dressed with cipollini onions and olive oil; and the best shrimp cocktail you're likely to find in New York is arranged over trays of ice. The far end of the counter is where the cooking happens. Squid bodies filled with tuna and chard are carefully grilled over charcoal, and tall golden columns of puff pastry are set on top of steaming bowls of oyster pan roast. Joshua Pinsky's cooking looks simple, and in some ways it is. But whenever there's a chance to make an element of a dish better, he takes it. Taste the fresh, fluffy brioche in the ice cream sandwich (Penny's only dessert) and you'll see what I mean. PETE WELLS
Shaw-naé's House
New York City Soul Food Opened 2021 shawnaeshouse.com
The soul food at Shaw-naé's House, on Staten Island, is as high-spirited as the six-table dining room, where customers invariably skip the short wine list in favor of a house rum punch or a pitcher of sangria. Almost every dish is a party in its own right, like the Soul Fries that are buried under cheese sauce, cubes of fried chicken, spoonfuls of collard greens and molten orange heaps of warm macaroni and cheese. It's hard to imagine a soul-food restaurant without fried fish, but there's probably no other place where that means a whole snapper that's been deep-fried twice for a resounding crunch and posed upright over a small sea of crisp fresh vegetables, as if it were still swimming. Shaw-naé Dixon, the chef and owner, got her start in catering for movie shoots, and she still knows how to lay out a spread that can excite a crowd. PETE WELLS
Bungalow
New York City Indian Opened March 2024 bungalowny.com
What happens when Indian food stops trying to cater to a white audience and finally gets to be itself? You get Bungalow, a for-us-by-us restaurant, where the chef Vikas Khanna weaves ambitiously through India's lesser-known regional dishes, putting personal, creative spins on each. A Lucknowi galouti kebab is constructed with silky kidney beans that are mashed, fried and sandwiched between rounds of lotus root. The ghee roast swaps the meat for plantains, enhancing the richness and sweetness of the fruit. The lamb chops, rich yet tangy with sour mango powder, are just plain primal. Mr. Khanna is one of the most famous Indian chefs in the world, and each night he strolls through the dining room to pose for selfies and sign cookbooks. But the boldness of these flavors shows he's so much more than his celebrity charm. PRIYA KRISHNA
Good Hot Fish
Asheville, N.C. Seafood Opened January 2024 goodhotfish.com
Southern fish camp meets Black Appalachian foodways at Ashleigh Shanti's easy, walk-in restaurant in the center of the brewery-heavy South Slope district. Leave it to a former chef de cuisine to make her own versions of Old Bay and sorghum-kissed hot sauce to season thick, tender fried fillets of catfish encased in crunchy, locally milled cornmeal. Have it on squishy white bread with buttermilk tartar, or as part of a lunch plate (served on an actual school cafeteria tray) with meaty Sea Island red peas, macaroni and cheese, and some righteous round hush puppies. The sleepers: a "Ranchovy" salad built with crispy local iceberg showered with fried shallot, chives and black pepper, and a burger made from shrimp caught off the coast of North Carolina. KIM SEVERSON
The Aperture
Cincinnati Mediterranean Opened January 2024 theaperturecinci.com
While the Aperture just opened this winter, it's not hard to find diners who have already made a ritual of visiting this Art Deco building for live-fire cooking from the chef-owner Jordan Anthony-Brown. The restaurant's regulars already have favorite bartenders and go-to orders like glazed hamachi collar, pita dips built from roasted vegetables, and tomato spaghetti swirled with candied chiles -- stars on a menu that reflects the kitchen's firm grasp of Mediterranean cuisine, particularly its eastern rim. For a snapshot of how fully Levantine cooking has been embraced by diners in the United States, book a table at this date-night restaurant in the city's Walnut Hills area. BRETT ANDERSON
Noche Woodfired Grill and Agave Bar
Tulsa Mexican Opened November 2023 eatdrinknoche.com
At first look, you might think Noche resembles a zillion other popular Mexican restaurants. It's sleek, festive and loud, with a crowd spilling out of the colorful dining room onto an expansive downtown patio. Beers and margaritas all around! That familiarity ends with your first bite. The complimentary chips are housemade, presented not with a generic salsa but with a purée of black beans and fruity guajillo chiles. Fiery chile heat is reserved for the shrimp aguachile, served in a bath of lime juice, radish and serranos, while Yucatán-style pork shoulder in salsa verde is like great barbecue, smoky and complex. Wrap it in blue corn tortillas. But don't forget the extensive collection of agave spirits. ERIC ASIMOV
L'Orange
Portland, Ore. Seasonal, Modern French Opened June 2023 lorangepdx.com
L'Orange is a real charmer. Occupying the second floor of a Victorian house that has variously been a telegram office and a butcher shop over the last 100-odd years, the dining room has a homey sophistication. The menu, which the chef Joel Stocks changes with the seasons, speaks French with a Pacific Northwest accent. Nestle into a chair at the six-seat chef's counter (read: bar) for a glass from the wine list curated by Jeff Vejr, a co-owner, and a couple of plates as the afternoon light fades to early evening. An ornate ruffle of shaved tête de moine cheese or the chicken liver mousse, presented in tartlet form with a strawberry and red wine gelée, will do very nicely. But so will a buckwheat crepe, amply filled with bay shrimp, Gruyère and zinged with candied jalapeño. And with nothing on the menu more than $ 30, becoming a regular is a tempting prospect. BRIAN GALLAGHER
Yaowarat
Portland, Ore. Thai Chinese Opened October 2023 yaowaratpdx.com
Inspired by Bangkok's Chinatown, the latest project from Akkapong Earl Ninsom (whose Langbaan is widely regarded as one of the best Thai restaurants in the country) is a freewheeling affair. Both the room and the food have a night-market feel. Paper lanterns and candles cast a moody light, while dishes like double-fried chive cakes, with a perfect crisp-outside-to-fluffy-inside ratio, and Yaowarat Road Squid, sloshed with fish sauce and Thai chiles, bring the bewitching depth of flavor found in the best street food. The kuay teow kua gai, chewy wide rice noodles with pork-fat chicken and a steamed egg, is a must. And a delightfully silky mapo tofu may render any other version of the dish disappointing hereafter. BRIAN GALLAGHER
Fet-Fisk
Pittsburgh Seafood Opened March 2024 fetfisk.net
Fet-Fisk is the restaurant equivalent of a cozy sweater. It feels lived in -- and not just because of the vintage platters and wood paneling. The co-founders Nik Forsberg and Sarah LaPonte have created an atmosphere, and a Nordic-inflected menu, that is refined (the bright and fennel-y seafood salad is a far cry from the gloppy picnic version) yet comfortable and unfussy. The duo started Fet-Fisk as a pop-up in 2019, and it became so beloved that Mr. Forsberg was nominated for a James Beard award in 2023 even without a brick-and-mortar spot. He and his co-chef, Csilla Thackray, can make a delicate appetizer of thin-sliced scallops and pickled strawberries feel at home alongside a rustic main of chicken brined in whey and smothered with lingonberries and fresh cheese.

Little Walter's
Philadelphia Polish, American Opened June 2024 littlewaltersphilly.com
With Fishtown already overrun with boutiques and chic restaurants, it was only a matter of time until the overflow spread to nearby East Kensington. Navigate the tight residential streets and you'll find this dimly lit, low-slung corner restaurant serving robust and deftly executed Polish cuisine. The pierogies are a nonnegotiable, of course, but there are other equally appealing dishes: the rustic sourdough served with dill butter and smalec (lard); the wieprzowina z rożna, sumptuous rotisserie pork on a bed of hearty kapusta (stewed cabbage with onions and sauerkraut); and because this is Philadelphia, a seasonal take on water ice, which at the time of this writing featured blueberries and sour cherry. NIKITA RICHARDSON
Passerine
Lancaster, Pa. French, American Opened June 2024 cafepasserine.com
To outsiders, Lancaster may evoke rolling farmland and Amish families in horse-drawn buggies, but such imagery belies a city of far more diverse and cosmopolitan tastes. (It is only 80 miles west of Philadelphia, after all.) Downtown Lancaster is an especially attractive setting for this months-old restaurant, which since June has been quietly serving outstanding dishes made with the bounty of the surrounding farmland and accented by global sensibilities. Think perfectly seared scallops set into a colorful salad of sweet summer corn and shishito peppers, or a 25-layer zucchini and goat ricotta crepe cake under a shower of ramp powder. Based on my visit in July, it's unclear whether Lancastarians know that they have an absolute gem of a restaurant in their midst. Consider this a heads-up. NIKITA RICHARDSON
Gift Horse
Providence, R.I. Korean, Seafood Opened June 2023 gifthorsepvd.com
On any given night, the shuckers behind the horseshoe bar at Gift Horse are prying open oysters grown in about a dozen spots along the Rhode Island coast. The quality of the shellfish is impressive even before you dress them with kimchi mignonette or a few jade-colored drops of hot sauce drawn from fermented green chiles. Sky Haneul Kim, the chef, reworks the traditional New England raw bar using the flavors of South Korea, where she was raised. Kimchi of crisp spring asparagus is piled over steamed littlenecks dug from Narragansett Bay. Whipped smoked fish pâté is served with puffed sheets of fried nori. Butterfish, standing in for mackerel, is broiled under a dark glaze of sweet-potato miso. Gift Horse deserves to be talked about in the same breath with Yangban in Los Angeles, Atoboy in New York and a handful of other restaurants that are busy bringing American ways of dining into the orbit of Korean cuisine. PETE WELLS
Lost Isle
Johns Island, S.C. Southern, Global Opened December 2023 lostislechs.com
There's a party going on behind a tattered ranch house outside Charleston: a cluster of tables, under swoops of sailcloth and some improbable-looking outdoor chandeliers, where the entire menu is cooked just a few feet away over open fires of white oak. Lost Isle calls itself "a truly local experience" -- the chef, Josh Taylor, who grew up in North Georgia, leans on Lowcountry staples like collards, grits and roasted clams. Yet the big flavors he applies (chimichurri, harissa, tamarind, togarashi) evoke his world travels. And though he leads with steaks and chops, the real standouts are non-meat dishes like sweet roasted carrots amped up with chiles and brown butter. Even sweeter are the celebratory vibe, a bustling bar and the hot slabs of semolina sourdough, streaked with olive oil and char, that get the festivities started. PATRICK FARRELL
City Limits Barbeque
West Columbia, S.C. Barbecue Opened 2016 citylimitsq.com
With a cooler of free beer for people waiting in line and a big white sign with just the letters BBQ out front, City Limits is the place students of regional smoked meat dream of. Robbie Robinson, recently nominated for a James Beard award, presides. His vinegary South Carolina-style chopped pork sandwich is a master class, with crisp bits of cracklings mixed into the luscious meat, at its best topped with a proper scoop of slightly creamy, finely chopped coleslaw. He veers expertly into Texas territory, too. Snappy Hill Country sausages and meaty beef ribs sell out early. Don't sleep on the warm peach cobbler, either. The bad news? The barbecue is available only on Saturdays (with the exception of a monthly whole hog situation on Sunday). KIM SEVERSON
Bad Idea
Nashville Lao, Wine Bar Opened October 2023 badideanashville.com
Bad Idea may well be what many seasoned diners thought when they heard there was a wine bar specializing in envelope-pushing Lao food opening inside an East Nashville church. But given the level of cooking here, the name turned out to be a self-aware joke, rather than a self-own. The concept coheres in the hands of the owner, Alex Burch, a seasoned sommelier and first-time restaurateur. He had the good sense to bring on Colby Rasavong as executive chef. The former top lieutenant to Sean Brock grew up working in his Laotian family's Thai restaurant. He invests the weight of his life experience in food that stretches the boundaries of Southeast Asian cooking to the edge of Appalachia. And the wine list is wise beyond this restaurant's years, mixing tantalizing obscurities, affordable crowd pleasers and connoisseur selections you'll rarely find poured by the glass. BRETT ANDERSON
Edessa
Nashville Kurdish Opened 2018 edessarestauranttn.net
Any meal at this Kurdish restaurant should begin with an assortment of dips, ideally including the walnut-studded haydari, along with savory baked items like lavash, which comes straight from the oven, filled with hot air and covered in sesame seeds, and the spinach-and-cheese stuffed gozleme flatbread. From there, you'll have to make some hard choices. Pide, stuffed cabbage and magnificent lamb stew poured straight from its clay pot? You'll definitely want a mixed grill of kebabs and an order of cig kofte, the spicy, inscrutably delicious bulgur wheat balls. Yes, it's a lot of food, so bring friends. That's what everyone else seems to do at this convivial restaurant in the Little Kurdistan section of Nashville, home to the country's largest Kurdish population. BRETT ANDERSON
Simply South
Irving, Texas South Indian Opened February 2024 simplysouth.us
The Sunday scene here speaks volumes: The wait is three hours, the chatter of Telugu fills the space and the tables are full of bisi bele bath, filter coffee and every variety of dosa and idli you can imagine. In a former Tex-Mex restaurant on the side of Highway 635, Simply South quickly earned the blessing (and then some) of Dallas's sizable Indian population, thanks to a menu of dishes from Andhra Pradesh, in southern India, that tastes like home cooking from the chefs Venkatesawara Rao Muttavarapu, Manikandan Ramalingam and Anoop Muraleedharan. The flat discs of gunturu thatte idli, made with fermented rice, come steaming and soaked in ghee and podi, a deeply savory blend of dry lentils and chiles. There's a dosa made of nutty millet, and another, the benne dosa, that is enriched with butter. All come with six different chutneys and a sinus-awakening sambar that you'll want to guzzle from a mug. PRIYA KRISHNA
Barbs B Q
Lockhart, Texas Barbecue Opened 2023 barbsbq.com
Barbs B Q honors centuries of barbecue traditions while also bucking them. The owner, Chuck Charnichart, has an impressive résumé that includes institutions like Franklin and Goldee's, and she has opened her restaurant in the barbecue capital of Texas. But more crucially, she brings a distinct point of view that makes her food stand out in a crowded meat landscape. The pork ribs are inspired by the flavors of chamoy, the fruity, tangy condiment that she loved during her upbringing in the Rio Grande Valley, and brightened with a sprinkle of lime zest. The brisket is tender in all the right ways, with a smoky, peppery crust, but a piquant rub of chile de arbol and chile de guajillo brings an unexpected flash of heat. And the sides are not to be outdone, particularly the poblano-based green spaghetti, which tastes like fettuccine Alfredo with a huge, verdant personality. PRIYA KRISHNA
Viola and Agnes' Neo Soul Cafe
Seabrook, Texas Creole Opened 2015 neosoulfood.org
Located down the street from NASA (yes, that NASA), Viola and Agnes' Neo Soul Cafe has poor signage but big flavors. A crab claw juts thrillingly out of the gumbo, along with a cloud of white rice and several fat rounds of okra. This is a soul-food dreamscape, suffused with the flavors of the sea; salty, snappy links of andouille sausage; and fat hunks of bone-in chicken just waiting to be discovered as you dig in. The fried catfish is so long it barely fits the plate, and every bite is as crisp as the last. Puffs of cornbread disappear into the various porky, spicy stews, and into your mouth. The chef Aaron Davis -- who has Louisiana roots and named the restaurant after his grandmothers -- has spent the last few years honing this rustic Southern cooking that embodies all the delights this planet has to offer. PRIYA KRISHNA
Joon
Vienna, Va. Persian Opened June 2023 eatjoon.com
Through her award-winning cookbooks and acclaimed cooking classes, Najmieh Batmanglij has spent her 40-year career exploring the history and richness of ancient Persian and modern Iranian cuisines. In 2023, she brought these exquisite tastes to life by opening Joon (in partnership with Christopher Morgan, the ex-chef at the Middle Eastern standout Maydan) in this suburb of Washington, D.C. The cavernous space, accented in watery blues, is like a portal to another world, scented with rose water and saffron. Both are used exuberantly on the mostly classic menu, designed for sharing. Bring a crowd to savor heaping platters of lamb shoulder with fava beans and dill, duck fesenjoon with pomegranate and fried onions, and a stunning pistachio soup laced with sour orange that's both creamy and tart. MELISSA CLARK
Sumac
Sperryville, Va. Farm-to-Trailer Opened 2020 sumac-va.com
One of the best, most elegant bites I've eaten all year -- slivers of golden tilefish with juniper and whey over sticky rice -- wasn't arranged on a ceramic plate in a fancy restaurant. It wasn't served on a plate at all, but nestled into a paper bowl at a picnic table in front of Pen Druid Brewery in rural Virginia. That's how it goes at Sumac, where all the proteins, dairy, vegetables and grains are grown within a 150-mile radius and cooked over a fire in a trailer parked in a field. The setting may be rustic, but Abigail and Dan Gleason's cuisine is fiercely refined, with a menu that changes as the hyperlocal ingredients come into season, like the black walnuts paired with rabbit or the wild persimmons strewed over masa cake for dessert. MELISSA CLARK
Familyfriend
Seattle Guamanian, Filipino American Opened December 2023
It's never a bad idea to start with a killer burger. And Familyfriend's version -- a paragon of the smashed double-cheese form plied heavily with Kewpie mayo, chopped pickles and onion -- is already getting national renown. This Seattle newcomer describes itself as a "Vibe Dispensary on Beacon Hill," but lucky for the neighborhood, it doesn't stop at burgers and vibes. The owner, Elmer Dulla, is from Guam, and like the food of that island (and the team of cooks in the kitchen), the menu is proudly pan-Pacific. The diners lined up at opening time are there for the burger, sure, but also piquant chicken adobo tacos and batchoy "La Paz Style," an envelopingly unctuous noodle soup of pig offal and fermented shrimp broth. The cocktail menu is similarly laced with flavors from around the Pacific, like calamansi and salted Chinese plum. And if you don't end with the fried-to-order Typhoon Donuts with white-peach coulis, you've left your meal unfinished. BRIAN GALLAGHER
Moon Rabbit
Washington, D.C. Modern Vietnamese Opened January 2024 moonrabbitdc.com
Kevin Tien is a Vietnamese American chef from Cajun Country. Those bare facts help explain many of the flavors found in the string of well-regarded restaurants he has opened in Washington, but they only begin to capture the breadth of the cooking at Moon Rabbit. Mr. Tien co-owns this latest, most fully realized restaurant with Judy Beltrano, its co-chef, and Susan Bae, the pastry chef whose desserts you don't want to miss. The food is playfully creative, but their cooking chops are serious, as evidenced by dishes as varied as boudin-stuffed quail, luscious green curry sponge cake and pâté chaud worthy of Antonin Carême. That this collective is showcasing such excellence so close to the Capitol somehow makes everything all the more delicious. BRETT ANDERSON
Pascual
Washington, D.C. Mexican Opened January 2024 pascualdc.com
It took the chefs (and life partners) Isabel Coss and Matt Conroy several years to bring Pascual to life. The wait was well worth it. Named for the patron saint of cooks beloved in Mexico, Pascual is both homey and elegant, exuding the stylish energy of Mexico City. Many of the best dishes are inspired by Ms. Coss's upbringing in Mexico -- fideos charged with black garlic and huitlacoche, an umami-fied version of the ones she would eat after school, and the giant, airy buñuelo that fills an entire plate and comes alongside a bitter, warm chocolate sauce and toasty cajeta. No table is complete without the lamb-neck barbacoa, brined in salt and orange juice, marinated in adobo, seared over the wood fire, cooked overnight and served over creamy ayocote beans. You'll stuff the fatty, pull-apart strands of meat into homemade tortillas and understand why these chefs are in a league of their own -- not just for Mexican cooking, but all cooking. PRIYA KRISHNA

A Pygmy Hippo Steals Hearts (and Bites Zookeepers): [Style Desk]

Author: Foley, Becca; Riffe, Noah

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Moo Deng, whose name translates to "bouncy pork," has united the internet while following a familiar path to stardom.
Defiant, sassy, slippery, chubby, loves to scream. We can all relate.
If you have yet to come across the internet's favorite pygmy hippopotamus, then meet Moo Deng. She's a bit of a diva.
"The hottest, hottest new It girl on the planet," Hoda Kotb, a co-anchor on the "Today" show, said during a recent episode. "She's redefining beauty standards: She's got chubby pink cheeks, a distinct potato shape."
Since Moo Deng's public introduction by the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Chon Buri, Thailand, south of Bangkok, on July 25, when she was 2 weeks old, her star has only risen.
Her name, which translates to "bouncy pork," was chosen by a poll held on the zoo's Facebook page; around 20,000 people voted. There were three options: Moo Deng, Moo Sap (minced pork) and Moo Daeng (red pork). Moo Deng won easily.
Atthapon Nundee, Moo Deng's keeper at the zoo, began sharing content about the pygmy hippo on social media immediately. "I think I am close with her to the point I can share lovely day-to-day activities," he said in an email. "Most people like that and watching her grow up."
But it was Yammi Saracino, a ceramacist and content creator born in Bangkok, who is at least partially responsible for the hippo's initial international fame. When he saw the zoo's Facebook poll, he felt compelled to translate it into English so that a broader audience would find her.
"The winner clearly was Moo Deng," he said. "I think that partially had something to do with me, because I was like, 'I'm voting for this name, so help me vote for this name."'
Interest outside the zoo has been huge ever since, with the young pygmy hippo being mentioned by companies, sports teams, public transit, buildings, an encyclopedia and meme lovers all over the world. There is even a cryptocurrency that bears her likeness.
The whole adventure has raised awareness for pygmy hippopotamuses, which are smaller and more land loving than a common hippo. They are native to the swamps and forests of West Africa and there are fewer than 3,000 of the animals in the wild.
That being said, Moo Deng is not the only one to gain internet fame: Toni, a pygmy hippo at Zoo Berlin, has also had people talking this summer. But Mr. Saracino believes Moo Deng has been able to stand out, thanks to her cuteness and spunky personality.
"Moo Deng specifically, even in comparison to her siblings, is really bouncy and really feisty," he said. "She has no teeth but is adamant about biting her keeper." (This is probably because Moo Deng is teething, according to Mr. Nundee, Moo Deng's keeper.)
There is hope among the staffs at the zoos involved that the starring role that Moo Deng and Toni have played could have a positive long-term effect for other pygmy hippos.
"With their childlike behavior, baby animals have the wonderful potential to draw even greater attention to endangered animal species," said Philine Hachmeister, the deputy head of communications and marketing at Zoo Berlin, adding: "Animals help to build a bridge and are a good introduction to the complex interrelationships of nature."
All of the attention on Moo Deng has also, unfortunately, come with a few bumps. After tourists began throwing things at her enclosure in hopes of waking her, the zoo had to limit viewing times at Moo Deng's enclosure to 10 to 15 minutes and enhance the road to accommodate the amount of traffic, said Narongwit Chodchoi, the zoo's director. Recently, however, visitors have been respectful and have followed the zoo's instructions, members of the zoo's staff said in an email.
But Moo Deng seems to be handling the fame fine. "For the mental health, I build trust with Moo Deng by engaging in conversation," Mr. Nundee said, adding that he calls her by her name and makes physical contact with her.
If all of this sounds at least a little familiar, it may be because in 2017, another baby hippo took the internet by storm. In January of that year, the Cincinnati Zoo announced the premature arrival of Fiona, a common river hippopotamus, and proceeded to post photos daily at noon for the clamoring public.
"We definitely didn't always know she would be a star," said Jenna Wingate, the head keeper of the Africa department at the Cincinnati Zoo. "But we figured it out pretty quickly."
Just like Moo Deng, Fiona saw her popularity grow online, as did demand for zoo tickets and viewings. In response, the Cincinnati Zoo started "Hanging With Hippos," an up-close-and-personal tour.
"We equate it to people trying to get Taylor Swift tickets," Ms. Wingate explained. "They'll log in on their iPad, their phone and their computer."
Zoo staff thought Fiona's popularity would wane as she grew out of her adolescent stage, but seven years later she is still generating lines of people waiting to see her and buy her branded merchandise, with the fame helping generate more than $ 1 million for the zoo, allowing it to assist in worldwide conservation efforts for hippos.
The Khao Kheow Open Zoo hopes to do similar work, using their profits to give back to research and conservation efforts both inside and outside of the zoo.
But while Fiona may be the original hippo It girl, zoo staff said she was happy to share the spotlight. "Fiona loves everyone, she would love to see Moo Deng doing her thing," Ms. Wingate said. "Pygmy hippos are much more endangered than common or Nile hippos, and I think if this sparks interest in one person to grow up to be a conservationist and that makes a difference for them, that's incredible."
So what's next for Moo Deng? She's staying just as sassy. "Her behavior may change depending on mood because now she is a superstar," Mr. Nundee said.
The Khao Kheow Open Zoo said it was planning to trademark "Moo Deng the hippo." The zoo released a line of clothing featuring the hippo's likeness, selling out almost immediately, and set up a 24-hour livestream.
Mr. Saracino doesn't see an end in sight, especially in Thailand. He plans to visit Moo Deng in the coming months. "I don't think it's reached its peak yet," he said of the hippo's popularity. "She's ours, we love her."

A Pygmy Hippo Is Stealing Hearts (and Biting Zookeepers)

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Defiant, sassy, slippery, chubby, loves to scream. We can all relate.
If you have yet to come across the internet’s favorite pygmy hippopotamus, then meet Moo Deng. She’s a bit of a diva.
“The hottest, hottest new It girl on the planet,” Hoda Kotb, a co-anchor on the “Today” show, said during a recent episode. “She’s redefining beauty standards: She’s got chubby pink cheeks, a distinct potato shape.”
Since Moo Deng’s public introduction by the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Chon Buri, Thailand, south of Bangkok, on July 25, when she was 2 weeks old, her star has only risen.
Her name, which translates to “bouncy pork,” was chosen by a poll held on the zoo’s Facebook page; around 20,000 people voted. There were three options: Moo Deng, Moo Sap (minced pork) and Moo Daeng (red pork). Moo Deng won easily.
Atthapon Nundee, Moo Deng’s keeper at the zoo, began sharing content about the pygmy hippo on social media immediately. “I think I am close with her to the point I can share lovely day-to-day activities,” he said in an email. “Most people like that and watching her grow up.”
But it was Yammi Saracino, a ceramacist and content creator born in Bangkok, who is at least partially responsible for the hippo’s initial international fame. When he saw the zoo’s Facebook poll, he felt compelled to translate it into English so that a broader audience would find her.
“The winner clearly was Moo Deng,” he said. “I think that partially had something to do with me, because I was like, ‘I’m voting for this name, so help me vote for this name.’”
Interest outside the zoo has been huge ever since, with the young pygmy hippo being mentioned by companies, sports teams, public transit, buildings, an encyclopedia and meme lovers all over the world. There is even a cryptocurrency that bears her likeness.
The whole adventure has raised awareness for pygmy hippopotamuses, which are smaller and more land loving than a common hippo. They are native to the swamps and forests of West Africa and there are fewer than 3,000 of the animals in the wild.
That being said, Moo Deng is not the only one to gain internet fame: Toni, a pygmy hippo at Zoo Berlin, also had people talking this summer. But Saracino believes Moo Deng has been able to stand out, thanks to her cuteness and spunky personality.
“Moo Deng specifically, even in comparison to her siblings, is really bouncy and really feisty,” he said. “She has no teeth but is adamant about biting her keeper.” (This is probably because Moo Deng is teething, according to Nundee, Moo Deng’s keeper.)
There is hope among the staffs at the zoos involved that the starring role that Moo Deng and Toni have played could have a positive long-term effect for other pygmy hippos.
“With their childlike behavior, baby animals have the wonderful potential to draw even greater attention to endangered animal species,” said Philine​​​​ Hachmeister, the deputy head of communications and marketing at Zoo Berlin, adding: “Animals help to build a bridge and are a good introduction to the complex interrelationships of nature.”
All of the attention on Moo Deng has also, unfortunately, come with a few bumps. After tourists began throwing things at her enclosure in hopes of waking her, the zoo had to limit viewing times at Moo Deng’s enclosure to 10 to 15 minutes and enhance the road to accommodate the amount of traffic, said Narongwit Chodchoi, the zoo’s director. Recently, however, visitors have been respectful and have followed the zoo’s instructions, members of the zoo’s staff said in an email.
But Moo Deng seems to be handling the fame fine. “For the mental health, I build trust with Moo Deng by engaging in conversation,” Nundee said, adding that he calls her by her name and makes physical contact with her.

Russian Air Raid Reminds Ukraine Of Enemy's Might: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned an assault of more than 200 missiles and drones that ranged from Kyiv to Odesa to Ukraine's West. Energy infrastructure was again a target.
Moscow launched more than 200 missiles and drones across a wide swath of Ukraine on Monday, damaging energy facilities and sending residents of Kyiv into basements and subways to seek shelter. President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the assault as "one of the largest strikes" of the 30-month-old war.
The strikes occurred at a volatile time in the conflict, coming against the backdrop of Ukraine's cross-border incursion into southern Russia -- the first invasion on Russian soil since World War II. On Monday, Ukraine's forces continued to try to advance in the region.
The offensive into the Kursk region has shifted the dynamics of the war after months in which Kyiv's forces were on the defensive in Ukraine's East. The push has slowed in recent days, but Mr. Zelensky said on Sunday that Ukrainian forces had advanced by one to three kilometers and taken control of two more settlements. It was not possible to verify the claim independently.
At the same time, Russian troops have been attacking relentlessly along the front line inside Ukraine, closing in on the key city of Pokrovsk and razing towns and villages with artillery barrages and glide bombs.
The drone and missile attacks on Monday, which began around dawn, targeted energy infrastructure in the capital, Kyiv, and in the regions of Lviv and Rivne in the West and Zaporizhzhia in the Southeast, the authorities said.
The strikes appeared to be an escalation of a Russian campaign against Ukraine's power grid and inflicted damage significant enough to cause blackouts in Kyiv and other cities.
"Like most previous Russian strikes, this one is just as vile, targeting critical civilian infrastructure," Mr. Zelensky said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. "There is a lot of damage in the energy sector," he said, adding that crews were repairing the damage.
Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukrainian energy infrastructure in attempts to damage the economy and compound civilian misery caused by the war.
Officials said at least four people had been killed and more than 30 others injured on Monday. An earlier estimate said that eight people had died.
Air-raid sirens have become a grim routine for many in Ukraine, and on Monday people in Kyiv sought shelter in basements and in the city's subway system, whose stations are deep underground.
The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, reported power and water outages in some parts of the city, and the head of the regional administration in Lviv, Maksym Kozytskyi, also reported power failures.
In the city of Lutsk in northwestern Ukraine, the attack damaged an apartment building, the city's mayor, Ihor Polishchuk, wrote in a post on social media. He later said that one person had been killed. A 69-year-old man died in the Dnipropetrovsk region of southern Ukraine, according to the governor, Serhii Lysak, while the governor of the Zaporizhzhia region, Ivan Fedorov, said that a man had died in an attack there.
There were also deaths in Kharkiv and Zhytomyr regions, the local authorities said.
The Russian Defense Ministry, which typically remains silent about attacks it conducts against cities and other civilian targets in Ukraine, said nothing on its Telegram channel.
The rate at which the Ukrainian Air Force said it was intercepting drones and missiles dipped earlier this year as its stockpiles dwindled and the U.S. Congress debated whether to keep sending American-made interceptor missiles. Supplies resumed in the spring after the United States passed a $ 61 billion aid bill, and this summer Western air defense systems have rushed into Ukraine.
Ukraine's Air Force claimed it shot down or electronically disabled 201 of the 236 missiles and exploding drones Russia fired on Monday, a figure that could not be independently verified. The statement did not elaborate on how Ukraine had achieved the 85 percent success rate, but it was one of the highest of the war.
Ukraine said "all available weapons and equipment were used," including fighter jets, ground-launched interceptor missiles and teams of soldiers with machine guns.
Ukraine has also increased its own attacks on military and infrastructure targets within Russia, hoping to slow its war effort, damage its economy and potentially sap civilian morale. Last week, it struck a sprawling oil and aviation fuel tank farm in Russia's Rostov region, setting it ablaze.
On Monday, a fire broke out at Omsk oil refinery, one of the largest oil refineries in Russia, according to the Omsk regional governor, Vitaly Khotsenko, who said in a post on Telegram that one person had died and six others were injured. The governor did not say what caused the fire at the refinery, which is around 1,500 miles from the Ukrainian border.
The Russian strikes in Ukraine on Monday came a day after a missile strike on a hotel in the eastern city of Kramatorsk killed a British safety adviser working with a team of journalists from the Reuters news agency and wounded two of Reuters's reporters. One of the journalists, a 40-year-old Ukrainian, remained in critical condition, while the other had been discharged from hospital, Reuters said in a statement on Monday.
Ukraine's state prosecutor said on social media said it had opened an investigation into possible war crimes and that the residential neighborhood in Kramatorsk where the hotel was located had been deliberately targeted by Russian forces -- though it is not known whether the hotel itself was a target.
Kramatorsk is around 16 miles west of the front line in Donetsk Province, which has experienced the heaviest fighting this year with Ukraine on the defensive. Mr. Zelensky said on Monday that Ukraine had decided to further strengthen its defense of Pokrovsk, an important road and rail hub.
More than 10,000 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, according to United Nations data.
Ukrainian leaders used Monday's attack to renew their call for permission to use weapons systems provided by the country's allies in NATO, including the United States, to strike military targets in Russia. Dmytro Kuleba, the foreign minister, also called on Ukraine's western neighbors to shoot down Russian missiles flying inside Ukraine near their borders, to ease the burden on Ukraine's air defense forces.
"None of these decisions are escalatory," Mr. Kuleba said on social media. "To the contrary, they will deter Russia."
The Polish military said it had scrambled jets in its own air force during the attack and that one airborne object, probably a drone, had crossed into Polish airspace, Polish news media reported. The object most likely crashed about 18 miles from the Ukrainian border in Poland, the military said, adding that a search was underway.
Ukraine's foreign ministry also issued a warning to Belarus on Sunday after Belarus massed troops from its own army and those serving in Russia's Wagner mercenary group to an area near Ukraine's border, near the Belarusian town of Gomel. The movements began after Ukraine's incursion into the Kursk region of Russia.
"We warn Belarusian officials not to make a tragic mistake for their country under Moscow's pressure," the statement said. If the forces attack over the border, the statement said, "all troop concentrations, military facilities and supply routes in Belarus will become legitimate targets."
The air defenses provided by Ukraine's allies are most effective in shielding Kyiv as well as strategic military and economic locations. Other cities are left thinly defended, sometimes by little more than soldiers who try to intercept drones and cruise missiles by firing machine guns mounted on the beds of pickup trucks.
Russia has been attacking Ukrainian cities with missiles and drones every few days in addition to launching daily barrages of artillery, mortar fire and missiles in areas near the front lines. On July 8, a missile slammed into Ukraine's largest children's hospital, which is in Kyiv, putting it out of action without killing any children. On the same day, attacks across the capital killed more than 30 people.

In Chicago, the Democrats Redefined Themselves: [Sunday Review Desk]

Full text: T IMES OPINION writers, columnists and contributors followed the Democratic National Convention over four nights in Chicago last week and shared their favorite speakers, notable moments and a few things they could have done without. Harris's Speech Megan K. Stack, contributing Opinion writer The first five minutes or so of Kamala Harris's speech accepting the Democratic nomination were genuinely affecting, and a pleasure to watch. Her personal story is complex and compelling, and she has a charisma and an audience connection that we haven't seen for quite some years in a major presidential candidate. Josh Barro, author of the newsletter Very Serious In past campaigns, Harris has sometimes seemed like an empty vessel. Now she's reintroducing herself in a way that is specific, warm and uniquely American, and that provides a framework to explain the broadly popular values of freedom and justice she's espousing. Jamelle Bouie, Opinion columnist The first three nights of the convention were easily the most successful since 2008, but they would have been for naught had Harris missed the landing with an awkward or underwhelming acceptance speech. She succeeded. But other than a moving introduction, where she told the story of her life and family to the viewing public, this wasn't a speech about the meaning of her candidacy. It was something closer to a State of the Union -- a statement of policies and priorities and an indictment of her opponents. It was as if the campaign had offloaded talk of symbolism to other speakers so that Harris could present herself as ready to be president on Day 1. Jane Coaston, contributing Opinion writer They landed the dismount. Harris's speech was well delivered and rhetorically effective, and aimed at a defined audience: the middle of the electorate. Matt Labash, author of the newsletter Slack Tide Harris did very well Thursday night -- arguably her best performance. Democrats threw a largely seamless convention. Confidence is good. But overconfidence leads to reality denial. Here's the truth: Harris is still behind in five out of seven swing states. So Democrats shouldn't unlace those hiking boots until they've actually summited Mount Comeback. Standout Speakers and Moments Frank Bruni, contributing Opinion writer The orgy of applause for Hillary Clinton. I'm a sap. I can't imagine what that meant to her, someone put through the political grinder like few leaders in my lifetime, someone forever haunted by (and blamed for) losing to Donald Trump. She needed that. So did Democrats. It affirmed their unity, elevated graciousness and turned the page. Michelle Cottle, political writer for Opinion The three women (and one man) who shared their heart-wrenching abortion stories. In the midst of all the good vibes, it was a sharp reminder of the concrete stakes of this election. Labash God bless Adam Kinzinger for telling the truth about his (and my) party, now corrupted to its core. MAGA snowflakes get triggered by him, suggesting he's a RINO Judas. But the actual reason they hate him is that he reminds them of something they abandoned years ago: their integrity. Charles M. Blow, Opinion columnist Michelle Obama taking direct swipes at Trump. She still hasn't gotten over -- and may never get over -- the way Trump harassed her family. It is a grudge worth holding. Kristen Soltis Anderson, contributing Opinion writer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. On a night that showcased the party's elders, Ocasio-Cortez demonstrated that she is their future. Republicans underestimate her at their peril. Bouie People are not exaggerating when they describe Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan as a presidential-level talent. Tressie McMillan Cottom, Opinion columnist Everyone will be talking about Gov. Wes Moore of Maryland after this convention. They should be. I will be talking about Alabama's Shomari Figures, who has a dynamic political biography and displayed a stunningly confident speaking style for a young elected official. The Democratic Party is taking working-class voters seriously. Liam Donovan, Republican strategist In a parade of speakers peddling predictable anti-Trump talking points, the second gentleman, Doug Emhoff, gave us the first speech making the pitch for Kamala Harris, the person. Disarming, self-deprecating, humanizing, it was the most effective speech yet for normies at home. Labash Emhoff was a genuine surprise: warm, funny, natural, human, clearly smitten with his spouse. Just like Melania! Michelle Goldberg, Opinion columnist Michelle Obama's speech was therapy for traumatized Democrats still mourning the "dimming" of hope under Trump and struggling to manage their anxiety over his possible return. Donovan Just put the franchise tag on Governor Moore right now. One way or another, the man will be on the next open Democratic ticket. Coaston Thousands of people chanting "Bring them home" as the parents of one of the hostages in Gaza stood before them. Low Points McMillan Cottom The omission of a Palestinian speaker. An easy political win that should have been logistically possible. Stack The petty refusal, after much convoluted negotiation, to grant a Palestinian speaker even a few minutes onstage discounted the many Democrats who have long called for a cease-fire. More important, with more than 40,000 dead in Gaza, this omission was callous and simply wrong. Anderson President Biden being pushed out of prime time. It is understandable to want to make a break from the incumbent, but intentionally or not, it is just a brutal way to treat the incumbent president in your party. And I applaud Tim Walz for speaking about his family's infertility journey, and I am even willing to grant some latitude about being imprecise on the specifics of your own treatment. But since Walz did not use I.V.F. but a different fertility treatment, I.U.I., it hits a sour note with me to falsely imply many Republicans want to ban something they very much do not want to ban. Goldberg My mom texted me sleepy emojis and the words, "Clinton needs to get off the stage." But he kept going. And no Beyoncé?!?! Labash It's fun to see people having fun in politics again, and Democrats are obviously exuberant. But watching Chuck Schumer getting jiggy with it as he danced his way out to the lectern was a bridge too far. A bridge I want to burn, after bathing my eyes in hydrochloric acid. Cottle Crabby Uncle Bernie Sanders and his laundry list of policy must-dos. I know. I know. He has a following. But his shoutygrumpy-old-man thing felt out of sync with the week's vibes. Maybe if he'd worn the mittens. . . . Coaston Never in my life did I think that the Democratic convention would attempt to claim "freedom, faith and football." Nor did I think it would actually be fairly successful. Takeaways Goldberg Republicans keep trying to weaponize bad-faith accusations of antisemitism against Democrats, but between Schumer, Sanders, J.B. Pritzker and uber-mensch Emhoff, Tuesday showed which party really welcomes Jews. Donovan Walz was on brand and Oprah Winfrey brought the star power, but the methodical buildup of Harris's record as a tough border-state prosecutor is a reminder of what this race will boil down to when the speeches fade. Blow The threat of Trump as a primary motivator has re-entered the chat. There was a parade of people victimized by Republican policies, obstruction or intransigence or victimized by Trump's own rhetoric. Even Harris's speech was dominated by the threat of Trump. Yes, there was dancing, but it shared space with damnation. Labash If, as many people fear, Trump is re-elected and tries to throw over the 22nd Amendment, which forbids presidents from running for a third term, then Barack Obama might want to enter the ring again. Love him or hate him, the man still has a wicked left hook.

Start-Up Wiz Rejects Google's $ 23 Billion Offer
Last week, it looked like Google was poised to snap up the cybersecurity start-up Wiz for $ 23 billion, in what would have been its largest acquisition ever.
On Monday night, Wiz told its employees that despite the large offer, the deal was off. The privately held company would instead pursue a public listing on a stock exchange, according to a memo viewed by The New York Times.
Wiz would continue to pursue its previously stated goal of generating $ 1 billion in recurring revenue ahead of an initial public offering, Assaf Rappaport, Wiz's chief executive, wrote in the memo.
"While we are flattered by offers we have received, we have chosen to continue on our path to building Wiz," he wrote. "Saying no to such humbling offers is tough, but with our exceptional team, I feel confident in making that choice."
Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A representative of Wiz declined to comment.
If it had been completed, the splashy purchase would have injected fresh momentum into Google's cloud-computing division and helped the company keep up with longtime rival Microsoft in cybersecurity. A growing number of businesses rely on Wiz to protect their cloud applications.
Google has never cut a check so large to buy another company, let alone a four-year-old start-up like Wiz. Its biggest deal was a $ 12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility in 2012, a company that it sold at a loss just a couple years later.
This time around, the regulatory hurdles appeared steep.
Google has had a testy relationship with U.S. regulators recently, with the Justice Department suing it in two separate antitrust cases meant to strike at Google's market power. One is targeting its ubiquitous search engine and another is seeking to break up its digital advertising-technology business.
A government review of a multibillion-dollar acquisition could take more than a year and sap a company of its momentum.

AVIATION
F.A.A. Starts Inquiry
Of Southwest Incidents
The Federal Aviation Administration is launching a safety review of Southwest Airlines after a series of incidents including some that raised serious concerns, the airline said on Tuesday.
Southwest said it was working closely with the agency on its evaluation of recent events.
The F.A.A. said on Saturday it was investigating a July 14 Southwest Airlines flight after it flew at a very low altitude over Tampa Bay in Florida. The flight was approximately 4.8 miles from the Tampa airport when it dropped to as low as about 150 feet, according to Flightradar24 data.
The Tampa flight was the latest in a string of Southwest incidents that have raised safety concerns, including a Southwest 737 flight in April that came within about 400 feet of the ocean off Hawaii after the first officer inadvertently pushed forward on the control column and the plane hit a maximum descent rate of about 4,400 feet per minute.
The FAA is also investigating another very low altitude Southwest flight near the Oklahoma City, Okla., airport. REUTERS

Democrats See Opening to Reshape the Race: [Correction]

Full text: Democrats are eager for her to deploy lines of attack that come more naturally than they did for President Biden, including on issues like abortion rights and the rule of law.
From the beginning of President Biden's ill-fated re-election bid, Democrats struggled to frame the race as a choice between two radically different visions, rather than a referendum on Mr. Biden's age and abilities.
But now that he has dropped out and Vice President Kamala Harris is cruising toward the Democratic nomination, her party sees fresh opportunities to turn the public's attention back to the vulnerabilities of former President Donald J. Trump on key issues for voters, including abortion rights, fundamental democratic principles and questions of economic fairness.
Democrats hope that Ms. Harris -- a history-making former prosecutor who is nearly two decades younger than Mr. Trump -- can draw a sharp new set of contrasts and tap into arguments that were out of reach for Mr. Biden, 81, starting with the issue of age but extending into matters of policy and personality.
That is especially clear on abortion rights. Mr. Biden, a practicing Catholic, has long been uncomfortable discussing the issue, or even saying the word "abortion." Ms. Harris, by contrast, speaks easily and openly about reproductive health and has held campaign events alongside women sharing their stories of miscarriages, abortions and challenges with fertility.
Republicans, for their part, plan to argue that Ms. Harris still owns the unpopular parts of Mr. Biden's record, saying that she is also weak on issues like inflation and immigration. Polling has shown Mr. Trump with significant advantages on many of the most important issues for voters, other than abortion rights.
But in interviews, Democrats were eager to make the race about character and experience, noting Ms. Harris's law enforcement background and Mr. Trump's litany of legal problems.
"She is a former prosecutor and he is a convicted felon," said Marcia L. Fudge, a former housing secretary in the Biden administration who said she had spoken with Ms. Harris on Sunday. "If there ever was a huge choice, this is it."
Mr. Biden's miserable debate performance late last month stole the spotlight from Mr. Trump's 34-count felony conviction in Manhattan. Many Democrats had hoped Mr. Trump's criminal status could be used to their advantage, but that line of attack was put on hold as Mr. Biden tried to quell the Democratic revolt against his candidacy.
Democrats are now moving to renew it, casting Ms. Harris as the "rule of law" candidate and hammering home the fact that the twice-impeached Mr. Trump sought to overturn the results of a free election.
"What is particularly important, especially in this case, is her history as a prosecutor -- someone who has stood for law and order," said Representative Veronica Escobar, a Texas Democrat who served as a co-chair of Mr. Biden's campaign. Mr. Trump, she added, is "a convicted criminal, who not just violates the law, but believes very firmly that the law does not apply to him and his supporters."
Before being elected to the Senate in 2016, Ms. Harris served as the district attorney of San Francisco and the attorney general of California. She sometimes struggled to discuss her history in law enforcement and matters of criminal justice during her 2020 presidential campaign, when many Democrats were pushing to rein in the powers of the police.
But she relishes bringing up those roles on the campaign trail now, and her allies say she will try to wield them against Mr. Trump as she makes the case that he is unfit to return to the White House.
"As many of you know, I am a former prosecutor, so I say: Let's look at the facts, shall we?" Ms. Harris said to roars from a crowd in North Carolina last week before dissecting the policy differences between Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump.
Ammar Moussa, a spokesman for the Harris campaign, said the vice president would press her "contrast" with Mr. Trump.
"Vice President Kamala Harris has held criminals accountable her entire career -- and Donald Trump will be no different," Mr. Moussa said in a statement. "Vice President Harris has dedicated her career to making life better for working people -- while Trump only cares about himself."
In a statement, Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, tried to undermine Ms. Harris's credentials by accusing her of embracing "pro-criminal, soft-on-crime policies."
While worries about public safety have been galvanizing in some elections, no issue has energized Ms. Harris, or Democratic voters, more than abortion rights. The issue has fueled a spate of Democratic victories in recent years, and helped Ms. Harris recover her political footing after a shaky start to her term as vice president. Ms. Harris says she has appeared at nearly 100 events on reproductive rights since the Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade decision two years ago.
"This election will be won on abortion rights and there is no one better to make the case to voters," said Jessica Mackler, the president of Emily's List, which supports Democratic female candidates who back abortion rights. The group has fiercely defended Ms. Harris and has used polls to test messaging about her political strengths and weaknesses.
Its research, Ms. Mackler said, found that highlighting Ms. Harris's work on abortion rights "will turn out the voters we need to win in November -- young voters, women and voters of color."
Abortion access was top of mind on Sunday as Ms. Harris and her staff made the case to other Democrats that they should back her, according to a list of talking points used to outline those conversations that was reviewed by The New York Times.
Ms. Harris is the party's "leading messenger" on abortion rights, according to the document, and will make certain that Mr. Trump's role in overturning Roe "is front and center in this election."
When talking to voters about the issue, Ms. Harris often strives to make it personal, recounting how she was motivated to become a prosecutor after learning in high school that her best friend was being molested by her stepfather. This year, she became the highest-ranking federal official to visit an abortion clinic. She has slammed abortion restrictions in red states as "Trump abortion bans."
"We believe in freedom," Ms. Harris said last week at an event in Michigan. "Freedom from the government telling us what to do about matters of heart and home. We believe in the right of people to make basic decisions like when and if they will start a family."
Her messaging on abortion has been far clearer than that of Mr. Biden, who supports abortion rights but struggled to articulate his position at the debate last month.
Republicans, for their part, are hoping to blur any policy differences between Ms. Harris and Mr. Biden.
Ms. Harris's "dismal record is one of complete failure and utter incompetence," Mr. Cheung said. "Her policies are Biden's policies, and vice versa."
Even before Mr. Biden dropped out, the Trump campaign had a plan to attack Ms. Harris if she became the nominee: tie her to the most unpopular parts of the president's record.
At the Republican National Convention last week, speaker after speaker misleadingly referred to Ms. Harris as the Biden administration's "border czar." They argued that the large numbers of undocumented migrants crossing into the United States were her fault. Polls have shown that voters give Mr. Biden low marks for his handling of the border crisis, although Democrats have criticized Mr. Trump for persuading Republican lawmakers to walk away from a bipartisan immigration deal.
Inflation has also bedeviled Mr. Biden. Although cost increases have slowed and the causes of inflation are complex, Republicans have squarely blamed the president and his policies for rising prices. Voters say they are unhappy with Mr. Biden's stewardship of the economy, and negative views of inflation have helped sap his support from Black and Hispanic voters, both crucial parts of the Democratic coalition. As Mr. Biden's partner in government, Ms. Harris will have to overcome that glum mood.
"I'd take the next three weeks and hang the Biden White House's failures on her," said David Kochel, a Republican strategist based in Iowa. "Most people think the country is going in the wrong direction. They need to place her right in the middle of that."
Republicans wasted no time starting their attacks. On Monday, the Trump campaign said in an email that "Kamala Harris is Joe Biden 2.0."
And less than an hour after Mr. Biden dropped out, the leading pro-Trump super PAC posted an ad on X saying Ms. Harris had "covered up" the president's "mental decline" and was responsible for his "failed record."
"Look what she got done," the ad's female narrator says. "A border invasion. Runaway inflation. The American dream, dead."
But Ms. Harris's supporters were working to turn the tables on Mr. Trump at every turn.
Erin Wilson, the vice president's White House deputy chief of staff, said in a call on Sunday with the group Win With Black Women that Ms. Harris would use her skills as a prosecutor to lace into Mr. Trump, who at 78 is only three years younger than Mr. Biden, and use his age against him.
Left unsaid: That argument had been impossible for Democrats to make with Mr. Biden at the top of the ticket.

Recent Market Activity Betting on a Trump Win: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Donald Trump's running mate is pro-labor, a fan of crypto and the F.T.C.'s Lina Khan, and says Big Tech is too powerful.
A new wave Republican
Donald Trump picked J.D. Vance as his running mate and a possible successor to lead the "Make America Great Again" movement.
Much will be made of Vance's light political résumé -- he was elected to the Senate only two years ago. He's also been scathing about Trump in the past, having called him an "idiot" and himself a "Never Trump guy." But Vance says he's a convert, becoming one of Trump's biggest backers and adopting a similarly populist approach to the economy and business.
Vance's biography appeals to left-behind voters -- and investors. The 39-year-old served in Iraq and later went to Yale Law School, where he met his wife, Usha Vance. (She resigned from her role as a trial lawyer at Munger Tolles & Olson after Vance joined the ticket.) Vance rose to national prominence after publishing the best-selling memoir "Hillbilly Elegy." He worked at Mithril Capital Management, a venture capital firm co-founded by Peter Thiel, and Steve Case's Revolution. He also started his own fund with backing from Thiel, Eric Schmidt and Marc Andreessen.
Silicon Valley helped get him on the ticket. Vance is close to the libertarian wing of the tech industry. Thiel gave millions to his Ohio Senate campaign in 2022 and Vance is reportedly close to David Sacks, the venture capitalist who has hosted a Trump fund-raiser at his home and spoke at the Republican National Convention on Monday.
DealBook examined Vance's links to business, and his views on the economy and industry:
Vance has been tough on regulation, and has backed Lina Khan, the F.T.C. chair. Some tech investors celebrated having a former V.C. on the ticket. But Vance has said Big Tech is too powerful and called for Google to be broken up. He's also backed some of the Biden administration's efforts to constrain the industry. While many Republicans and business leaders have attacked Khan, Vance has said she is "one of the few people in the Biden administration who I think is doing a pretty good job."
Vance is pro labor. He says the postwar economy has relied too heavily on cheaper labor, a tactic that undercuts wages for American workers and has been exploited by big business. He's argued that employers' zeal for cheap labor has helped lead to a surge in unauthorized immigration to the U.S. and that consumers have become addicted to products made in low-wage countries. Those factors have aggravated America's foreign trade deficit and hit domestic manufacturing, he's said.
Vance isn't sold on the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency. Last year, during an exchange with Jay Powell, the Fed chairman, Vance said dollar dominance was good for Americans' purchasing power but a "tax on American producers." Like Trump, he is supportive of crypto and is reportedly working on legislation that would change how the U.S. regulates digital assets.
Vance is all in for Big Oil. He has expressed skepticism about the role of humans in causing climate change, and has attacked the Inflation Reduction Act, which provided incentives for the green transitions. Instead, he called for more drilling for shale oil in Ohio.
He's seen as another Republican who has distanced himself from the pro-globalization wing of the party. "Vance is a leader of the post-financial crisis Republican generation," Matt Stoller, research director at the American Economic Liberties Project, told DealBook, and is trying to reorient how the party thinks about economic policy.
Yet Vance's ideological approach, and his positive comments about Khan, worry some in business. "Trump populism and Vance populism are not the same," one big bank lobbyist told The Financial Times.
In other election news: The Democratic National Committee is moving to push President Biden toward the nomination, as he returns to campaigning and reiterated in an interview with NBC News that he wouldn't withdraw.
HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
Markets grow hopeful for more rate cuts. Jay Powell, the Fed chair, indicated on Monday that the central bank could lower borrowing costs before inflation falls to a 2 percent target. The dovish signal comes as traders see room for the Fed to cut three times this year; Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs's chief economist, asked in an investor note whether that should start this month.
Macy's stock tumbles after the retailer calls off sale talks. Shares in the retailer fell nearly 12 percent on Monday after the company said it had broken off discussions with the investment firms Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management, citing uncertainty over financing. That puts more focus on Macy's turnaround plan, which includes closing stores.
Sequoia is said to offer its investors a way to cash out of Stripe. The venture capital firm plans to buy up to $ 861 million worth of shares in the payment processor at a $ 70 billion valuation, Axios reports. The deal is meant to give investors more liquidity (a big issue for many private investment firms), given that Sequoia has been invested in Stripe for nearly 14 years and the payments company appears unlikely to go public anytime soon.
General Motors tamps down expectations for electric-vehicle production. Mary Barra, the car maker's C.E.O., said that the company wouldn't have the production capacity to make one million E.V.s at the end of 2025, an acknowledgment it will fall short of a stated target. It's the latest sign of a slowdown in the E.V. market's growth, though Barra added that demand will eventually pick up.
Musk offers money and words to back Trump
Days after Elon Musk publicly endorsed Donald Trump for president, it now appears that the tech billionaire is prepared to offer financial support as well.
Musk is likely to donate a significant amount to America PAC, a pro-Trump group whose backers already include a number of Musk's Silicon Valley allies, The Times and others report. It's another sign that the Tesla chief intends to take a more active role in seeking Trump's victory.
Musk plans to give about $ 45 million a month, according to The Wall Street Journal. (Earlier this year, one leader of America PAC told a friend that an unnamed donor was likely to give as much as $ 160 million, The Times reports.) Musk had previously said that he wouldn't give to either Trump or Biden or a Republican super PAC.
Such a donation would shatter records, eclipsing the $ 50 million that the billionaire Timothy Mellon gave to a different pro-Trump super PAC.
That said, Musk responded to The Journal's story on his X social network with an illustration of wildebeests with human legs bearing the caption "FAKE GNUS."
America PAC has a bevy of high-profile backers. One key fund-raiser is Joe Lonsdale, the venture capitalist and co-founder of Palantir who is one of Musk's close friends, people close to the organization told The Times.
Others include Antonio Gracias, a director at SpaceX and a former board member at Tesla; Ken Howery, a former Musk ally at PayPal; Doug Leone and Shaun Maguire, investors at Sequoia Capital; the Winklevoss twins; and Joe Craft, a coal magnate.
The super PAC stands to become a major political force. It collected about $ 8.8 million in the second quarter alone, and spent $ 15 million in recent weeks. Being able to tap even a fraction of Musk's estimated $ 252 billion fortune could give it formidable resources to organize support for the Trump campaign.
In other donation news: The billionaire financier Ken Griffin gave $ 10 million to Republicans' Congressional Leadership Fund, bringing his total giving to G.O.P. super PACs in this cycle to $ 25 million.
"A French wealth tax would increase French export of good entrepreneurs to Silicon Valley! Please go for it!"
-- Vinod Khosla , the venture capitalist, taking a swipe at speculation that French politicians will reinstate a wealth tax as part of negotiations to form a governing coalition in Parliament.
The Trump trade
The S&P 500 is up more than 18 percent this year, fueled by investor fervor for artificial intelligence and the hopes that the Fed will start cutting interest rates.
The calculation of a potential Donald Trump return to the White House could be another catalyst, analysts say.
Market watchers are calling it the return of "the Trump trade." This implies that Trump 2.0 would mean lower taxes, deregulation, increased oil drilling and more fiscal spending. "Equities saw a clear rotation into stocks that stand to benefit from Trump's policies," Jim Reid, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a note on Tuesday.
The big winners on Monday included crypto stocks -- and digital assets like Bitcoin -- and oil majors. Trump Media, the former president's social media company that seems to ride the wave of Trump's political fortunes, also rose more than 30 percent.
Here's where investors put their money:
GEO Group and CoreCivic, two of the nation's largest publicly traded private prison operators, had their strongest days this year. The former gained more than 9 percent as investors weigh whether Trump's tough-on-crime campaign messaging will turn into policy that would bolster the sector.
The best performing sectors in the S&P 500 on Monday were energy and financials. The former, which includes Chevron and Exxon Mobil, climbed nearly 1.6 percent even as oil prices fell.
Coinbase, the crypto exchange, had its best day since March, gaining more than 10 percent, and Bitcoin nearly hit $ 65,000 before sinking. Trump appears to be warming to crypto as the industry gives millions to his campaign. The Republican Party platform is bullish too, vowing: "We will defend the right to mine Bitcoin, and ensure every American has the right to self-custody of their Digital Assets, and transact free from Government Surveillance and Control."
Climate-related stocks were among the losers. "Trump has been openly hostile to environmental and climate regulation and the companies that might benefit from them," Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told DealBook. "Investors in those more volatile companies did not wait around to assess the probabilities of a Trump victory."
Worth noting: The S&P 500 is up roughly 48 percent since President Biden's inauguration day, one of the best market runs of the past century. Investors have concerns about both candidates, including that Biden would raise taxes that might sap corporate profits, and Trumponomics could mean a raft of inflationary tariffs that could hamper growth.

Employees With Autism Find New Ways to Navigate the Workplace: [Style Desk]

Full text: As diagnoses of autism rise, Microsoft and other large companies are working to better support autistic workers so they can thrive without "masking."
When Chelsia Potts took her 10-year-old daughter to a psychologist to be tested for autism spectrum disorder, she decided almost as an afterthought to be tested herself. The result came as a surprise. Like her daughter, Ms. Potts was diagnosed with autism.
Ms. Potts, 35, thought she might have had anxiety or some other issue. A first-generation college student, she had earned a doctor of education degree and risen through academia to become a high-level administrator at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. But after her visit to the psychologist, she had to figure out how her diagnosis would affect her work life.
"Initially, I was confused, and I did keep it to myself," Ms. Potts said. "I had a picture of what someone with autism looked like, and that did not look like me."
She considered the ways she had compensated in the past in an effort to hide her disability and come across as a model employee -- a coping mechanism known as "masking."
For years, she had angled to meet with co-workers one on one, because she felt ill at ease in group settings. She reminded herself to smile and appear enthusiastic, knowing that some people found her speaking voice overly serious. She also tried to avoid bright lights and noise in the workplace.
After wrestling with her diagnosis for six months, Ms. Potts met with a university official. That conversation "was one of the most difficult experiences of my life," she said.
"I'm telling someone something I've never really told anybody outside of family," she continued. "I felt very vulnerable. I felt shame. I realized how hard it was for me to voice what I need and why I need it."
But the meeting led to positive changes for Ms. Potts: She received some accommodations, including a more flexible work schedule.
A number of large employers across the United States, including Microsoft, Dell and Ford, are taking steps to make workplaces more accessible and welcoming for neurodivergent employees as the number of autism diagnoses rises.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that one in 36 8-year-olds in the United States has autism. That's up from one in 44 in 2018 and one in 150 in 2000, an increase that experts attribute, in part, to better screening. In addition, 2.2 percent of adults in the country, or 5.4 million people, are autistic, according to the C.D.C.
An increasing number of autistic people are also identifying themselves publicly. Ms. Potts is one of many TikTok users who have shared their diagnoses online using the hashtag #autistok.
Last year, the singer Sia went public about being diagnosed with autism as an adult. More recently, the author Mary H.K. Choi described in an essay for New York magazine how, at age 43, she developed a greater self-understanding as a result of her diagnosis.
Autism activists have praised companies that have become more accepting of remote work since the coronavirus pandemic.
Workplaces with too much light and noise can overwhelm those who are autistic, leading to burnout, said Jessica Myszak, a clinical psychologist in Chicago who specializes in testing and evaluations for autism. Remote work "reduces the social demands and some of the environmental sensitivities" that autistic people struggle with, Dr. Myszak added.
But navigating the job market remains a challenge for autistic people, who are more likely to be unemployed or underemployed, according to advocacy groups. And autistic job candidates hoping to make good first impressions might be reluctant to disclose their diagnoses or ask for accommodations upfront.
"You don't want them to see your flaws," said Haley Moss, 29, a lawyer and disability activist who has autism, likening the interview process to a first date.
Microsoft Recruits
Back when Natalie Worden-Cowe, 32, was a professional musician, she struggled with the networking side of the business, a key to landing gigs. When she decided, a few years ago, to switch careers and became a software engineer, she had trouble making it through job interviews. Her professional life changed when she discovered Microsoft's neurodiversity hiring program, which was established in 2015.
The company's program was modeled after a venture created by the German software firm SAP, and has since been adopted in some form by companies including Dell and Ford. So far, the initiative has brought in about 300 full-time neurodivergent employees to Microsoft, said Neil Barnett, the company's director for inclusive hiring and accessibility.
"All they needed was this different, more inclusive process," Mr. Barnett said, "and once they got into the company, they flourished."
Mrs. Worden-Cowe, who was diagnosed at 29, noticed the difference at Microsoft during the interview process: She was given extra time to answer questions and downtime between meetings with company employees.
"Neurodiverse people sometimes need a bit more processing time, or they might need the questions written down," Mrs. Worden-Cowe said.
Once on board, she was given a job coach to help her with time management and prioritization. Microsoft also paired her with a mentor who showed her around the company's campus in Redmond, Wash. Perhaps more important, she works with managers who have received neurodiversity training.
The Microsoft campus also has "focus rooms," where lights can be dimmed and the heights of desks can be changed to fit sensory preferences. Employees seated in the open office may also request to sit away from busy aisles or receive noise-canceling headphones.
"Agendas are sent in advance," Mr. Barnett said. "Everyone's communication style and preference is noted."
Mr. Barnett rejected the misconception that such accommodations cost companies revenue, efficiency or productivity. Rather, he said, they improve the workplace culture and the staff's overall well-being.
Wendi Safstrom, president of the Society for Human Resource Management Foundation, the nonprofit arm of a leading trade association for H.R. professionals, said that more employers should make an effort to recruit neurodivergent people and educate their work forces about them. "If they're not willing to change with the times, they're going to be left behind," Ms. Safstrom said. "The war on talent is real."
Ms. Moss, the lawyer, said that human resources departments had shown a willingness to change. "In most cases, they already have autistic employees who have not disclosed," she said. And yet, she added of autistic workers, "a lot of us don't get promoted."
More employers should place neurodivergent people in leadership roles, Ms. Moss said -- in essence, to redefine the image of a boss. "You can be someone who communicates outside of what is considered normal and be a fantastic executive," she said.
'My Authentic Self'
For Murphy Monroe, communicating at work was never a problem. Highly verbal, Mr. Monroe, 50, excelled because he could quickly memorize statistics about the organization he worked for and its competitors.
Having been told since childhood by therapists that he was probably on the autism spectrum, but having never been tested, Mr. Monroe tried to avoid the matter. As a teenager, he knew he was different and was "scared, actively, of not being able to hold a job," he said.
He studied theater in college and pursued a career in education, spending 17 years as an admissions officer and executive at Columbia College Chicago. Like Ms. Potts, the administrator at Miami University, Mr. Monroe came up with strategies to navigate the workplace, including being shadowed by a trusted colleague who helped him pick up on social cues he might have missed.
"Do I have anyone I need to apologize to?" Mr. Monroe would ask after meetings. "What just happened?"
"I chew on my fingers," he added, referring to a form of stimming, behaviors that help some autistic people manage sensory overload. "I would sit in a meeting with the college president or in front of a board and not be able to stop myself from making myself bleed. These are occasions where it's nice to have someone in the room with me, to tap me to leave."
At one point, Mr. Monroe did tell a human resources manager that he thought he might have a version of autism that made him overwhelmed by sensory input, especially lights. "She looked right at me and said, 'You are not autistic,"' Mr. Monroe recalled. "From that moment on, for many years, I didn't think about it."
But after he watched TikTok videos of people talking about their experience with autism, Mr. Monroe made an appointment with a psychologist in 2021 and received confirmation of what he had long suspected.
That self-knowledge has changed how he approaches his current job as the executive director of the Actors Gymnasium, a circus school in Evanston, Ill. "I had this real desire to just be open at work," Mr. Monroe said. "I just dove in. I bought a gold autism pin off Etsy and started wearing it all the time."
He also gives himself accommodations, like days away from the workplace to recharge and dark curtains in his office. He tries to be sensitive to his co-workers as well, he said, allowing them to adjust their schedules or duties in ways that make sense for them, whether they are neurodivergent or neurotypical.
In short, he is trying to create the atmosphere he would have wanted back when he was masking to get by. It's the kind of workplace that many autism activists hope will become more common.
"For me to be completely my authentic self while I am running a joyful enterprise," Mr. Monroe said, "it makes me feel like I'm the luckiest guy ever."

An Aversion to Political Protests: [Letter]

Full text: To the Editor:
Re "No, I Don't Want to Protest," by Pamela Paul (column, June 21):
I often enjoy Pamela Paul's well-expressed and proud contrarian views. However, in this column she not only declares, almost boastfully, that she happily avoids protest participation, but also seems to disparage the value and effectiveness of protests.
Protesting, after all, is a central part of America's historical legacy. As Ms. Paul acknowledges, "we live in a country born of protest." Was not the Revolutionary War our grand protest against Britain's oppressive colonial rule?
My guess is that Ms. Paul disapproves of the recent student encampments protesting Israel's aggressive actions in Gaza. (I don't, by the way.) But what does she think of the sit-ins and marches led by Martin Luther King and others in the 1950s and 1960s against Jim Crow in the South? Or the unions that organized the movement for better pay and workers' rights in the 1930s? Or the women who led the demonstrations in the early 20th century for women's right to vote?
It is all well and good that Ms. Paul chooses not to join protesters -- that is, of course, her right. She should take pains, though, to respect and perhaps even be impressed by the earnest Americans who decide for moral and/or political reasons to demonstrate for causes that may very well produce a better world.

To the Editor:
I've been waiting for someone to call out the uninformed, sometimes venomous and mostly absurd protests that have been swirling on campuses and beyond, and I thank Pamela Paul for doing so.
I was a campus radical myself lo these many years ago, and in my fervor, never questioned Chairman Mao and the Cultural Revolution; it's likely I knew nothing about it except that it was a revolution, so what could be bad?
Ms. Paul's column reminded me of a cherished New Yorker cartoon: Dad is sitting in his easy chair and explaining to his teenage son, "Of course there was sex and drugs when I was your age, but it was sex and drugs about ending the war."

Teaneck, N.J.
To the Editor:
I don't want to attend protests either. I tend to have social anxiety in crowds. I am conflict-averse and fear being the target of someone's anger or rage.
However, just because I don't like something, does not mean I have some special insight into whether or not that particular activity is valid, meaningful or productive for others.
While I agree change begins within -- such as sitting quietly in reflection, as Pamela Paul recommends -- I also recognize that awareness is a first step; next comes action. If not protest, then what is suggested for those who desire to stop seeing their tax dollars fund conflict that they do not support? I appreciate the need for social critique on how we seek to create change, but I am taken aback by the suggestion that any collective effort is cringey for its conformity.
So, while I do not protest, I do support those who do. I support and participate in divestment efforts and boycotting problematic companies. I donate money. I continue contacting my representatives and sharing information in hopes of educating others on the need for Palestinian liberation. I am determined to do all that I can to prevent the loss of more life.

'Quit Bashing Joe Biden'
To the Editor:
I am getting fed up with the constant news articles and opinion pieces in The Times urging President Biden to step down as the Democratic candidate, all because of a poor showing on a recent debate stage.
He had a bad night on June 27, but that doesn't mean he is incapable of running the country, which he has been doing well for the last three and a half years. Choosing another candidate at this late date would be a risky move for the Democratic Party.
The Times should be publishing more news and opinion pieces about the dangers that Donald Trump poses for our nation, his lies at the presidential debate, his supporters' Project 2025 playbook and his traitorous behavior on Jan. 6.
Quit bashing Joe Biden, and give more press to the evils that a second Trump term would bring to the nation.

'An Act of Civic Solidarity': Why Voting Matters
To the Editor:
Re "Why I Won't Vote," by Matthew Walther (Opinion guest essay, nytimes.com, July 4):
Mr. Walther argues that voting is "pointless" because elections are never decided by a single vote; instead, voting is merely "expressive," like cheering on a favorite sports team, with no effect on the outcome.
But even if that's true, what's wrong with being "expressive"? Indeed, Mr. Walther embraces the concept, arguing, "If voting is expressive, then the same is true, surely, of not voting."
What, then, does he express by not voting? It appears to be cynicism and despair. Mr. Walther believes that voting "cannot change the fact that financialization, environmental spoliation, drug addiction, the hollowing out of the public sector and the subsuming of virtually every aspect of human existence into reality-augmenting digital media are making this country an uninhabitable wasteland."
Failing to vote, however, "expresses" nothing meaningful about those problems. And how else does Mr. Walther propose to solve them?
Voting is an act of civic solidarity -- with fellow citizens and with those who marched, fought and died for the right to vote. That's a bond worth affirming, whatever the vote count may be.
Stuart Altschuler
New York
To the Editor:
The convoluted argument for not voting in Matthew Walther's essay is appalling, as it would logically lead to meaningless elections and eliminate democracy itself if everyone were to adopt a similar position.
While I agree that a single vote in most elections is unlikely to make a difference in who is elected, the process of thinking through the person, policies and party that one wishes to support is of great value in itself. Further, the many debates that folks have as they compare opinions before an election are influential in what is politically acceptable.
Simply put, voting is more than filling out a ballot.

Helping Migrants in New York
To the Editor:
Kudos on "All the Shelter a City School Can Provide," by Bliss Broyard (Opinion guest essay, June 30).
This is the story all over the city: public school parents and teachers stepping up for our newest New Yorkers, houses of worship petitioning to serve as shelters, community groups providing food and clothing and organizing against the city policy of 30- and 60-day evictions.
As the article makes clear, this eviction policy is disruptive and often re-traumatizing, and it saps the resilience and determination of tens of thousands of immigrants and asylum seekers to learn English, get job training and go to work to strengthen our economy.
We desperately need to fund the groups providing aid, augment the budget of recipient schools and expand capacity for work authorization and employment. The future economy of the city depends on it.

An Artist's Waning Love for His Craft: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Author: Rogers, Thomas

Publication info: Rogers, Thomas. 

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/artists-waning-love-his-craft/docview/3076324072/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A few years ago, the English artist Jesse Darling was standing in the vegetable aisle of a grocery store when he had a kind of epiphany. Staring at plastic-wrapped produce, he suddenly felt an acute awareness of the path the items had taken to get there: from cultivation to processing, to packaging and shipment, and then to their place on the shelves.
"I just stood there transfixed on the spot," he recalled in a video posted last year. "I had this overwhelming sense of how fragile and precarious and preposterous it was: utterly in excess of requirement and in excess of possibility."
Darling hopes to provoke such revelations among viewers of his works, which include sculptures and installations of manipulated found objects. He wants to expose the "fairy tale" of "the nation-state, the apparatus of capitalism, the structure of modernity, and race and gender," he said in a recent interview -- like "when someone is wearing an invisibility cloak and someone throws paint or talcum powder on it and it suddenly comes into view."
Last year, this approach won Darling the Turner Prize, the prestigious British award for contemporary art whose past winners include such heavyweights as Steve McQueen and Anish Kapoor. The win was met with unusually widespread praise: An article in The Guardian called Darling's work "full of personality, vulnerability, weird detours and alarming collisions."
Darling had been scheduled to open his first U.S. exhibition since his Turner Prize victory at Chapter NY in Lower Manhattan on July 11. He said that he did not want to talk about the gallery show and that he would make most of the works at the last minute. This 11th-hour approach "was a high-risk strategy, but it's the only way of doing things for me," he added. (On Tuesday, a Chapter NY spokeswoman said the exhibition had been postponed and would most likely take place in 2025.)
His Turner Prize show -- also hastily assembled -- included items embodying the ways that both abstract ideologies, including nationalism, and concrete institutions, such as the police, shape everyday life. Darling altered familiar items to make them simultaneously absurd, precarious and threatening: street barricades whose legs have been welded so they look like gallivanting figures, piles of folders affixed with self-made flags, a modified roller coaster track emerging from a wall.
Martin Clark, the director of the Camden Art Center in London and a member of the jury that awarded the Turner Prize to Darling, said the artist's work captured the "sickening sublimity and horror" of globalized capitalism and the power of the surveillance state. It evoked "wonder" alongside "this unbelievable apocalyptic sense of nihilism, which felt timeless, but also incredibly specific to what we're living through," Clark said.
Many news outlets saw Darling's Turner show as a particular comment on economic and social decline in post-Brexit Britain. Yet Darling no longer lives in the country and has made his home in Berlin for much of the past seven years.
In the interview in the living room of his spacious, cluttered apartment in the city's Neukölln district, Darling was self-critical, playfully confrontational and prone to tangents about economic and political theory. He emphasized that he did not enjoy public attention: After agreeing to an interview, he evaded and postponed a meeting over several months. When asked about his age, he said he was born in 1981, then added, "That's not actually true."
He also expressed ambivalence about winning the Turner Prize and a growing resistance to the art world in general. "Success in the art world means nothing, it doesn't mean more money, it's not additive, it doesn't mean any kind of stability," he said. Increasingly, he questioned his identity as an artist, and was considering stepping back from commercial artmaking, he said.
Born to a teacher and postal worker in Oxford, England, he said that encounters with wealthy students at the city's famed university had imbued him with an early awareness of class difference. The way that "those students moved their bodies left a lasting impression," he said. After discovering that "you don't really have to go to school," he said, he began skipping most classes except art and moved to Amsterdam after graduation.
He ended up attending the Gerrit Rietveld Academy art school there by day and doing sex work in the city's red-light district by night. The school threw him out after a year, he said. "The other students were these nice upper-middle-class Scandinavians and Israelis and Germans, and people would talk really seriously over cigarettes about color fields and feminist performance," he said. "I was having this secret life at night and trying to survive psychologically in ways the other students were not."
Addicted to drugs, he ended up living in squats and working as a cook. "I was very young, quite vulnerable and an addict surrounded by addicts," he said. But he continued making art by building props for elaborate parties held by friends in Amsterdam's left-wing activist community.
"I didn't get why someone would make something for a gallery," he said. "My work was all for my community."
He eventually returned to Britain and enrolled in 2008 at the Central Saint Martins school in London, where he studied theater stage design and then sculpture. He learned how to weld and began creating his found-object installations, guided by associations he made between the materials and their historical and economic contexts.
"Plastic is this zombie medium," he said, because it does not decompose and is made from fossil fuels derived of dead organic matter. "Steel is a technology of empire that enabled guns, the colonial project."
Darling has shown works shaped by these principles at galleries in London, Paris, New York and Marseille, France. Several of his pieces, including an installation of chairs teetering as if on stilts, were featured in the main exhibition at the 2019 Venice Biennale.
For a 2020 exhibition at the Kunstverein Freiburg, in southern Germany, he built a buckled roller coaster whose rails end up splayed out like twisted limbs. In an essay about the show in Artforum, Darling said this presentation in a Nazi-era swimming pool was partly an exploration of "the fascist obsession with the perfect body."
Darling's interest in this subject is partly biographical. In 2017, he was diagnosed with a neurological disorder that causes weakness and pain on one side of his body and saps his stamina for making art. For him, he said, "Disability is not a metaphor."
And although many news reports described him as the Turner Prize's first trans winner, Darling deflected when asked about his relationship with gender. "I usually tell the papers I am openly bisexual because it gives people something to talk about," he said, adding, "I have never met anyone who is heterosexual and cisgendered."
Concerns about disability and gender were raised in "The Ballad of Saint Jerome," a 2018 show at Tate Britain that centered on the legend of a saint who tamed a lion by removing a thorn from its paw. The show featured medical devices, sex toys and other objects arranged in provocative tableaus: a mobility cane contorted to look like a snake, a strap-on harness holding up cloth hangings from an improvised flagpole, and metal hands emerging from a wall to hold a ladder rising to the ceiling.
Sebastian Thomas, an artist in Reading, England, who helped assemble the works for several Darling shows, including for the Turner Prize, said the installations come together in an improvised way. "It's not high production values, it isn't about this glossy luxury product," he said. "It's about having a gnarly object and a direct relationship with it."
Thomas added that he was moved when Darling sold one of the pieces they had worked on together and paid him a portion of the earnings. "That is a mad thing I've never encountered before," he said. "He lives by what he preaches."
That also includes advocating political causes: Darling held up a Palestinian flag during his Turner Prize acceptance speech and signed an open letter protesting Israel's participation in this year's Venice Biennale. He also refuses to show his work in Germany because he believes that arts organizations there censor views that are critical of Israel. "Dissenting opinions" were being punished in the art world in the wake of Israel's war in Gaza, he said.
He admitted that it was awkward timing to have won the Turner Prize when his commitment to making art was faltering. "The problem is not the art, it is the condition of capitalism and the market, and the way that this whole gig operates," he said. He added that he had been avoiding going to his studio, which felt like "clocking on."
This fall he will try something different when he returns to his hometown to take up an associate professorship at the Ruskin School of Art, part of Oxford University. "I'm going to the citadel to see what it will be like," he said. "What will I be now, if I'm no longer marginal and precarious? I don't know, man."
He said that he hoped he might learn to enjoy making art again if it were more of a "hobby" than the focus of his career -- but that making such a pivot after all the Turner Prize hype was awkward. "I really didn't wish I had to always do my learning in public," he said. "It's a vulnerable time because I don't really know yet what I'm going to become."

Iran Names 6 Candidates For President After Crash: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The June 28 election to succeed President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash last month, comes as the country faces acute domestic and international challenges.
Six candidates, including the speaker of Parliament, have been approved to run in the Iranian election this month to succeed President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash last month. The vote comes at a moment when the country faces acute domestic and international challenges, state media said on Sunday.
The speaker of Parliament, Mohammad Baqer Ghalibaf, and five other men were approved by the Guardian Council, a 12-person body that vets candidates, for the balloting on June 28, according to the state news agency IRNA, which cited Mohsen Eslami, spokesman for the country's election headquarters.
Mr. Ghalibaf, a retired pilot and former commander of the Revolutionary Guards, has run twice unsuccessfully for the country's presidency and is a former mayor of the capital, Tehran. He became speaker of Parliament in 2020 following a legislative election.
The other candidates include a former interior minister, Mostafa Pourmohammadi; Saeed Jalili, a former chief nuclear negotiator; and the current Tehran mayor, Alireza Zakani.
The country's next president will be confronted with problems at home and abroad. Deep economic troubles, exacerbated by international sanctions, are fueling discontent among some Iranians who have demanded social and political freedoms as well as prosperity.
The largest recent uprising, led by women, erupted in 2022 after a young woman, Mahsa Amini, died in police custody; she was accused of improperly covering her hair under the country's hijab laws. Those protests grew to include demands for an end to clerical rule.
On the international front, the new president will also face the "Axis of Resistance" that Tehran has adopted as its policy against the United States and Israel, including by funding Hamas and Hezbollah, armed groups based in Gaza and Lebanon, and by arming the Houthis in Yemen, who have attacked cargo ships in the Red Sea.
A long shadow war between Iran and Israel broke into the open in April when Tehran launched a volley of missiles and exploding drones at Israel in retaliation for a deadly strike on an Iranian Embassy building in Damascus.
Beyond that, Iran has supplied Moscow with exploding drones that it has used in Ukraine to sap that country's ability to resist a full-scale invasion by Russia in 2022. That has, in turn, made Tehran a central player in an indirect confrontation between the Kremlin and NATO countries, including the United States.
The next Iranian president faces critical decisions about the country's status as a "threshold" nuclear state that could produce fuel for three or four bombs in short order. Last week, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency censured Iran over its refusal to grant inspectors access to its uranium enrichment program.
Iran has for years said that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and that it is not pursuing a bomb. But in recent months, several senior Iranian officials have said that it could revise its nuclear doctrine if it faced an existential threat from other nuclear countries, namely Israel and the United States.
Mr. Raisi died along with the foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, while traveling in the country's northwest. The president had been seen as a possible successor to the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and his death has shifted the dynamics in the debate over who could succeed Mr. Khamenei. One possible candidate is the supreme leader's son Mojtaba Khamenei.
While it was unclear how the June 28 election will shape questions of succession, the country's leadership has taken steps after Mr. Raisi's sudden death to project stability, emphasizing that the governing of the country will not be affected.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mr. Burgum, North Dakota's governor, is a prime contender in the former president's search for a running mate, but he remains untested on the national stage.
After taking his software company public in 1997, Doug Burgum gathered a few colleagues in his office and swore them to secrecy.
He wanted to uphold the modesty and decorum central to his North Dakota birthright and his chimney-sweeper past, but he was eager to boast about a splashy new purchase. While others splurged on cars or boats, Mr. Burgum's big reveal was a Bobcat front-end loader -- a dirt mover for his ranch near Fargo.
"I remember thinking, 'Yeah, Doug, you're not big-timing anyone with that one,"' Jeff Young, the software company's former operations chief, recalled with a laugh.
Now the governor of North Dakota, Mr. Burgum's long-held scruples over being seen as an attention-monger have hurled the longtime Republican out of political obscurity and into the limelight as one of a handful of the leading contenders in Donald J. Trump's search for a running mate.
Mr. Trump's campaign has requested personal information and other documents from a broad field of potential vice-presidential candidates, including Mr. Burgum, both as part of its vetting process and as a media strategy to build suspense ahead of a formal announcement planned for next month at the Republican National Convention, according to three people briefed on the process who insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations.
But Mr. Trump appears to have narrowed his focus to contenders with the ability to run a disciplined campaign, the people said. Reducing the potential for unwanted distractions has become increasingly important for a presidential candidate convicted last month on 34 felony charges and still facing multiple other legal problems.
Mr. Burgum has squarely positioned himself as a prime contender, spending months supporting Mr. Trump on the campaign trail and in court, while risking his own political capital back home for a former president who prizes loyalty, demands fealty and considers any attempt to intrude on his spotlight a betrayal of both.
Mr. Burgum has become perhaps the safest option on Mr. Trump's list -- and the biggest wild card.
He is largely untested on a national stage and is not known for thrilling applause lines on the stump. Mr. Burgum has little in the way of a public profile, even among Mr. Trump's attentive political base, and is not an ideological warrior like others under consideration.
And yet, his ambition in business and politics has set him apart in North Dakota. He has spent millions of his own dollars on political pursuits, including his underdog bid for governor in 2016 and his backing of an aggressive parade of Republican primary challengers against state lawmakers in 2018. His short-lived, long-shot bid for the White House last year cost him $ 14 million.
A spokesman for Mr. Burgum declined to comment. A Trump campaign spokesman said that only the former president knew whom he would pick for a running mate.
At the age of 67, Mr. Burgum is closer to a generational peer of the 77-year-old former president than most of the other Republicans under serious consideration. He endorsed Mr. Trump in 2016, but won both of his races for governor without relying on help from the former president. His independence, both electorally and financially, has helped ease Mr. Trump, who keeps close track of the political debts he's owed, according to two people familiar with the former president's thinking.
Mr. Burgum possesses a Stanford degree, an easy ability to talk sports and a thick head of hair, which he kept in a ponytail as a younger man and is now an object of Mr. Trump 's admiration. The former president has privately told people that Mr. Burgum has the "central casting" look he favors in public figures.
In some ways, he can be easy to pigeonhole as a mild-mannered Midwesterner. He worked as a chimney sweep in college, wearing a black top hat and tails to evoke Dick Van Dyke's character in "Mary Poppins." When he oversaw the construction of a new hotel in downtown Fargo, he ensured it would be shorter than North Dakota's tallest building -- the state capitol in Bismarck -- to avoid ruffling feathers.
Mr. Trump has discussed Mr. Burgum for a potential Cabinet post, speculation that allies of other vice-presidential contenders have eagerly pushed in an attempt to diminish him as a possible running mate. The result has been a stream of rumors connecting Mr. Burgum to multiple agencies, which his allies have privately nicknamed "Cabinet bingo."
"Opportunist isn't exactly the right word," said Ed Schafer, a former Republican governor of North Dakota. "But Doug Burgum is very good at identifying opportunities."
North Dakota Renown
Douglas James Burgum grew up in a tiny North Dakota town, but was born into a giant piece of the state's history.
His great-grandmother, Linda Slaughter, was among the earliest settlers in the Dakota Territory. She opened the town's first school, was a close friend of Susan B. Anthony's and, at the 1892 Populist Party convention in Omaha, became the first American woman to vote in a national convention for a presidential candidate.
Ms. Slaughter's daughter, Jessamine, was the first woman admitted to North Dakota State University, where a dorm was named after her in 1962.
Jessamine Slaughter -- Mr. Burgum's grandmother -- eventually moved to Arthur, N.D., a small town that her father-in-law had helped settle. Her husband, Joseph A. Burgum, managed the local grain elevator that the family founded in 1906. The family still runs the business, which remains central to the local economy.
Ms. Slaughter's youngest son, Joseph B. Burgum, married Katherine Kilbourne, a college dean. The youngest of their three children, Douglas, was sworn-in as the 33rd governor of North Dakota in December 2016.
As a student at North Dakota State, Mr. Burgum avoided declaring a major and instead asked friends for their most passionate teachers and enrolled in those classes. When a guidance counselor informed him he had enough credits to graduate, the school awarded him a degree in "university studies."
At Stanford Graduate School of Business, he played intramural football and basketball and befriended Steve Ballmer, the future Microsoft billionaire. Mr. Burgum earned his M.B.A. and left California for a job in Chicago at McKinsey & Company, the global consulting firm.
When a colleague showed off a new Apple II computer that calculated in minutes the numbers Mr. Burgum had spent hours crunching by hand, he decided to shift careers and become a tech entrepreneur.
Somewhat improbably, he moved back to Fargo to do it.
Beau Bateman, a farmer in North Dakota's Red River Valley, roped and branded cattle with Mr. Burgum when they were ranch hands in college. He was not surprised Mr. Burgum returned home.
"He is just a patriot for us," Mr. Bateman said as he sat on the back gate of his Ford F-150, his cowboy boots kicking at the gravel road.
Billion-Dollar Businesses
Mr. Burgum was 26 when he quite literally bet the family farm.
He mortgaged 160 acres of farmland inherited from his father to finance a $ 250,000 stake in Great Plains Software, a small Fargo-based start-up. With help from additional family investments, he soon took control of the company and installed himself as chief executive.
To attract talent, he pulled lists of graduates from North Dakota schools and launched his first direct mail campaign, recruiting engineers to return home and work at a company where he was promoting a family-friendly culture. He insisted on a front door for the new office building that would never lock and instead open to an anteroom, so those who forgot their keys could step inside and wait to be let in while sheltered from bitter winter winds.
In 1997, the company became the first tech company in North Dakota to go public.
Four years later, his old college buddy, Mr. Ballmer, came calling.
Mr. Burgum sold the company in 2001 to Microsoft for a $ 1.1 billion, all-stock deal and joined as a top executive. He left after six years and invested in SuccessFactors, a human-relations software company, where he was board chairman. SAP, the German software giant, bought the business for approximately $ 3.4 billion in 2010.
In 2012, Mr. Burgum invested in Atlassian, a cloud software company based in Australia that went public in 2015 and is now valued at more than $ 40 billion. He served as the company's board chairman until 2016, when he stepped down before he was sworn in as governor.
Mr. Burgum's previous career as an entrepreneur may help settle concerns from pro-business voters torn between Mr. Trump's putative trade policies and President Biden's allegiance to labor unions. But it's doubtful many even know him.
Asked during an interview on NBC's "Meet the Press" last summer if he would ever do business with Mr. Trump, Mr. Burgum said, "I don't think so."
"I just think it's important," Mr. Burgum said, "that you're judged by the company you keep."
Mr. Burgum has since reversed that position, telling Fox News last week that he now has a better understanding of Mr. Trump after having "had a chance to travel with him -- had a chance to see him, meet the real person."
That kind of political expediency is something of an art form back in Arthur, N.D.
Shirley Nedrebo, 88, who lived across the street from Mr. Burgum when he was a boy and still resides there, owns a Trump campaign hat, a souvenir from a 2018 rally in Fargo. One side of the red cap is fastened with a Burgum campaign pin. The other has a pin for Ben Carson, a former Cabinet secretary also under consideration as a running mate.
She spoke highly of Mr. Burgum and his family, but hedged when asked whom Mr. Trump should choose.
"Trump," she added, "will pick the right person."

Owners Face More Woes As Buildings Stay Empty: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The distress in commercial real estate is growing as some office buildings sell for much lower prices than just a few years ago.
Since the early days of the pandemic, owners of big buildings in New York and other large cities have been desperately hoping that the commercial real estate business would recover as workers returned to offices.
Four years on, hybrid work has become common, and the strain on property owners is intensifying. Some properties are going into foreclosure and being sold for sharply lower prices compared with valuations from less than a decade earlier, leaving investors with steep losses.
While the number of office buildings reaching critical stages of distress remains small, the figure has increased sharply this year. And investors, lawyers and bankers expect the pain to grow in the coming months because demand for office space remains weak and interest rates and other costs are higher than they have been in many years. The problems could be especially severe for older buildings with lots of vacant space and big loan repayments coming up.
The repercussions could extend far beyond the owners of these buildings and their lenders. A sustained drop in the value of commercial real estate could sap property tax revenue that cities like New York and San Francisco rely on to pay salaries and provide public services. Empty and nearly empty office buildings also hurt restaurants and other businesses that served the companies and workers who occupied those spaces.
"There is a lot more trouble coming," said Mark Silverman, a partner and leader of the CMBS Special Servicer group at the law firm Locke Lord, who represents lenders in disputes with commercial mortgage borrowers. "If we think it's bad now, it's going to get a lot worse."
Assessing the scale of the problem has been challenging even for real estate professionals because of the different ways in which commercial buildings are financed and the varying rules about what must be disclosed publicly.
Roughly $ 737 billion of office loans are spread across large and regional banks, insurance companies and other lenders, according to CoStar, a real estate research firm, and the Mortgage Bankers Association.
The delinquency rate for office building loans that are part of commercial mortgage-backed securities was nearly 7 percent in May, up from about 4 percent a year earlier, according to Trepp, a data and research firm. But only a small proportion of office loans, about $ 165 billion, are packaged into such securities.
Foreclosures, which can take place months or more than a year after a property owner falls behind on payments, are also climbing. Nearly 30 buildings in Dallas, New York City, San Francisco and Washington whose loans are part of commercial mortgage-backed securities were in foreclosure in April, up from a dozen in early 2023, according to Trepp.
Some buildings around the country have recently been sold for a fraction of their prepandemic prices.
In May, investors like insurance companies and banks in the top-rated, triple-A bond of a commercial mortgage-backed deal -- generally considered to be nearly as safe as a government bond -- lost $ 40 million, or about 25 percent of their investment. Holders of lower-rated bonds from the same commercial mortgage deal lost all of the $ 150 million they had invested.
The building that was the collateral for those bonds, 1740 Broadway, was bought by Blackstone in 2014 for $ 605 million. Blackstone had borrowed $ 300 million against the 26-story building near Columbus Circle. This spring, the building was acquired for less than $ 200 million.
"When you see delinquencies rising and foreclosures rising, that means we're approaching the acceptance stage of the grieving process for office properties -- and that's healthy," said Rich Hill, head of real estate strategy and research at Cohen & Steers, an investment firm. "But we're not at the bottom yet."
Mr. Hill said it could take until later this year or sometime in 2025 before the scale of the problems in the office market became clear.
Office leases tend to last as long as 10 years to give property owners time to recoup their investment and broker fees. Long leases also assure investors that they will be paid interest on the hundreds of millions of dollars -- sometimes even $ 1 billion -- that they have lent to real estate developers.
As a result, it can take a long time before decisions by tenants to downsize affect the market. In addition, some mortgages struck at low interest rates haven't yet had to be refinanced. But the longer interest rates remain elevated, the more buildings that were profitable when interest rates were close to zero might run into trouble.
Then there is the slow process of negotiation between borrowers and lenders as they look for ways to reduce potential losses by renegotiating or extending loans.
"Even though there has been a lot of anticipation, it takes a while to play out," said Anthony Paolone, co-head of U.S. real estate stock research at J.P. Morgan.
Part of the delay has also come from the difficulty of valuing buildings after the pandemic. Until enough properties are sold, it has been hard to know the true market value of buildings.
"A lot of that stuff at the moment is just spreadsheet math because there isn't the transaction activity to prove it out," Mr. Paolone said.
The sales that have taken place suggest a severe decline in commercial property values.
This spring, a 1980s-era office building at 1101 Vermont Avenue in Washington sold for $ 16 million, a sharp drop from its $ 72 million valuation in 2018. And near the Willis Tower in Chicago, an investor snapped up a landmark building late last year at 300 West Adams Street for $ 4 million that sold for $ 51 million in 2012.
"We went so long without any transactions that it created a lull," said Alex Killick, a managing director at CW Capital Asset Management, a special servicer that works with delinquent borrowers to recoup money for holders of commercial mortgage securities. "Now we are seeing some. There is finally some data to work with."
Some data suggest the pain is concentrated in a small proportion of buildings. While vacancy rates in U.S. office buildings are around 22 percent, roughly 60 percent of that vacant space was in 10 percent of all office buildings nationwide, according to Jones Lang LaSalle, a commercial real estate services firm, suggesting that the problems are concentrated rather than widespread.
Another hopeful sign, analysts said, was that the problems of office buildings did not seem to be endangering banks. After the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank last year, some investors had feared for the health of other regional banks, which are big lenders to the commercial real estate industry. But few of the commercial mortgages held by banks have become delinquent, according to the Commercial Real Estate Finance Council.
Also largely unaffected by the situation are newer trophy buildings in New York that are able to command rents of as much as $ 100 a square foot, double what older buildings can charge, according to the office of the New York City comptroller.
The problem is most acute for building owners whose mortgages are coming due and who are losing many tenants. About a quarter of existing office property mortgages held by all lenders and investors, or more than $ 200 billion, are set to mature this year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association and CoStar.
And while investors have been willing to lend new money to owners of warehouses or hotels, few want to refinance office loans.
That could spell the end of a tactic often referred to as "extend and pretend," which became popular in recent years. It is called that because lenders agree to extend mortgages in the hopes that, given more time, building owners will be able to attract more tenants.
That approach stemmed partly from the hope among landlords and lenders that the Federal Reserve, after ratcheting up interest rates over the last two years, would ease or cut rates relatively quickly. In recent months, most economists and Wall Street traders have concluded that the Fed will not rapidly lower its benchmark rate or return it to the extremely low levels in place before the pandemic.
"There has been a systematic holding of the breath, with everyone hoping that the rapid increase in rates by the Fed would be just as rapidly decreased, allowing people to breathe easier and rates would be restored to lower levels," said Ethan Penner, the chief executive of Mosaic Real Estate Investors, a firm in Los Angeles. "But that hasn't happened, and there is only so much time that a lender can provide a borrower in terms of patience and looking the other way, especially once lease income starts to shrink."
Another hope widely held in the real estate industry was that more companies would require employees to return to the office more frequently -- but that has also not panned out.
Law firms and the finance industry have slightly increased the office space they have leased from prepandemic levels, but many other industries have scaled back. As a result, new leases signed are down about 25 percent from 2019 as measured by square feet, according to Jones Lang LaSalle.
Over the course of a full week, roughly half of New York office workers on average are going to offices, according to Kastle Systems, which tracks how many employees swipe their ID badges at commercial buildings. That is roughly in line with the national average.
The numbers exemplify the smaller role offices now play in many white-collar Americans' lives. That shift comes at a time when the U.S. economy is healthy, suggesting that the problems in the office market may not pose a systemic risk to the financial system.
But property owners, their lenders and others connected to commercial real estate remain under pressure.
"I think we are going to be living with a number of tough headlines for a bit longer," said Mr. Paolone at J.P. Morgan. "These things just take a long time to play out."

Russia Steps Up Sabotage In Europe to Sap Support For Ukrainian War Effort: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Russian military intelligence, the G.R.U., is behind arson attacks aimed at undermining support for Ukraine's war effort, security officials say.
U.S. and allied intelligence officials are tracking an increase in low-level sabotage operations in Europe that they say are part of a Russian campaign to undermine support for Ukraine's war effort.
The covert operations have mostly been arsons or attempted arsons targeting a wide range of sites, including a warehouse in England, a paint factory in Poland, homes in Latvia and, most oddly, an Ikea store in Lithuania.
But people accused of being Russian operatives have also been arrested on charges of plotting attacks on U.S. military bases.
While the acts might appear random, American and European security officials say they are part of a concerted effort by Russia to slow arms transfers to Kyiv and create the appearance of growing European opposition to support for Ukraine. And the officials say Russia's military intelligence arm, the G.R.U., is leading the campaign.
The attacks, at least so far, have not interrupted the weapons flow to Ukraine, and indeed many of the targets are not directly related to the war. But some security officials say Russia is trying to sow fear and force European nations to add security throughout the weapons supply chain, adding costs and slowing the pace of transfers.
NATO and European leaders have been warning of the growing threat. Prime Minister Kaja Kallas of Estonia said last week that Russia was conducting a "shadow war" against Europe. Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland announced the arrest of 12 people accused of carrying out "beatings, arson and attempted arson" for Russian intelligence.
And Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store of Norway said Russia posed "a real and serious threat," after his country warned about possible attacks targeting energy producers and arms factories.
Amid the growing concern about sabotage, NATO ambassadors are set to meet next month with Avril D. Haines, the U.S. director of national intelligence. Ms. Haines will provide an intelligence briefing on Russia's war in Ukraine, but she will also discuss Moscow's covert sabotage campaign in Europe.
Security officials would not describe their intelligence linking the sabotage to the G.R.U., but American and British spy services have penetrated the G.R.U. deeply. Before the war in Ukraine, the United States and Britain released declassified pieces of intelligence exposing various G.R.U. plans to create a false pretext for Russia's invasion.
Despite the risk-taking reputation of the G.R.U., U.S. and European security officials said Russia was treading somewhat carefully with its sabotage. It wants to draw attention to the mysterious fires, but not so much attention that it would be directly blamed.
Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a former U.S. intelligence official, said Russia's plan might be to weaken European resolve. While that outcome may be doubtful, she said it was important for Europe and the United States to come together to respond to the sabotage campaign.
"Russia's strategy is one of divide and conquer," said Ms. Kendall-Taylor, now a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. "Right now, it's not a very costly strategy for Russia because we are all responding separately. That is why it is important that over time, we collectivize the response."
Hoping to do just that, British and other European diplomats have been pressing countries to call out Russian covert operations more aggressively.
One of the first of the recent sabotage acts attributed to Russia was a March fire at a warehouse in London. Authorities say the warehouse was connected with the effort to supply Ukraine but have provided few details.
Security officials briefed on the incident said G.R.U. operatives used a Russian diplomatic building in Sussex, England, to recruit locals to carry out the arson. Four British men have been charged with arson in the attack, and one of them has been charged with assisting a foreign intelligence service.
In response, Britain expelled a Russian military officer working for intelligence services and closed several Russian diplomatic buildings, including the G.R.U. operations center in Sussex.
The use of local recruits, security officials said, has been a hallmark of the recent sabotage campaign. U.S. and European officials said that is partly to make attacks more difficult to detect, and to make them appear to be the result of domestic opposition to supporting Ukraine.
Sabotage acts by Russia in Europe are not unknown. In 2014, Russian military intelligence blew up an ammunition depot in the Czech Republic, although the country did not publicly blame Russia until seven years later.
European governments expelled Russian spies from their capitals after a former Russian intelligence officer was poisoned in Salisbury, England, in 2018 and again following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The expulsions dramatically curtailed Russia's ability to mount attacks, said Max Bergmann, the director of the Europe, Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
"There has been a lot of disruption of Russian intelligence activities in Europe," Mr. Bergmann said. "That caused a pause, and Russian intelligence was consumed by the war in Ukraine. Now they have their footing back and are probably trying to build back up."
Since the invasion, Russia has appeared intent on not expanding the war into NATO territory. But Ms. Kendall-Taylor said Russia wanted to undermine the alliance and its support for Ukraine.
In the first part of the war, the Russian military performed poorly, and its intelligence agencies were too distracted to conduct covert operations in the West. But with its recent gains on the battlefield and a rebounding military industry, it has dedicated more resources to covert operations.
"They want to take the war to Europe, but they don't want a war with NATO," Ms. Kendall-Taylor said. "So they are doing all these things that are short of conventional attacks."
Forging a proper response, however, will be difficult. The United States and Europe have already imposed sanctions on Russia and expelled Russian spies.
"We are in a very delicate situation because things are already on edge, the Kremlin is already paranoid," Mr. Bergmann said. "So Western leaders have to tread very carefully with how they respond."

Kennedy Is Emerging as an Unpredictable Force: [National Desk]

Full text: Half of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s supporters said they were voting chiefly for him, and nearly half said their support was mostly a vote against President Biden or former President Donald J. Trump.
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is polling stronger than any third-party candidate has in decades, pulling in roughly 10 percent of registered voters across the battleground states as he saps support from both President Biden and former President Donald J. Trump, a new series of polls has found.
The overall results in the Biden versus Trump contest were virtually unchanged when Mr. Kennedy was included in the polls conducted by The New York Times, Siena College and The Philadelphia Inquirer. But beneath the surface of that seeming stability, the surveys revealed how Mr. Kennedy, powered by social media and younger voters, has emerged as an unpredictable X factor in what would otherwise be a 2020 rematch.
With less than six months until the election, the faction of the electorate giving Mr. Kennedy early support exposes some of the vulnerabilities inside the president's Democratic coalition. Mr. Biden dropped all the way to 33 percent in a five-candidate race, an alarmingly low share of the vote for an incumbent president. The series of polls focused on what are expected to be the most contested states this fall: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
Two of the groups that Mr. Kennedy performed strongest with in the surveys -- voters under 30 (18 percent support) and Latinos (14 percent) -- have traditionally been strong Democratic constituencies, unnerving some party strategists. Mr. Biden is also winning only half of Black voters in the multicandidate race.
Mr. Kennedy is clearly getting a boost from the rise of social media and the ability to communicate his message directly to voters. Among the roughly one in six voters who said they consumed most of their news from social media, Mr. Kennedy was getting 16 percent of the vote, nearly equal to Mr. Biden's 18 percent.
Among crucial independent voters, Mr. Kennedy was pulling in 16 percent support. But his supporters say they are far less committed to him than backers of Mr. Biden or Mr. Trump, and less likely to vote at all.
"I would support him as kind of like a protest vote," said Benjamin Sandoval, 21, a student at the University of Michigan who is originally from Ecuador and who described Mr. Biden as "weak" and Mr. Trump as a "bad man."
Half of Mr. Kennedy's supporters said they were voting chiefly for him, and nearly half said their support was mostly a vote against the other candidates.
Overall, Mr. Trump is leading by six percentage points in a one-on-one race with Mr. Biden. Mr. Trump was ahead by seven points when Mr. Kennedy and three other third-party candidates were included. None of those three other candidates topped 1 percent.
Polling third-party candidates has notoriously been tricky, and historically, their support has decreased as elections near and the reality of playing spoiler grows. In fact, Mr. Kennedy's support is already less than half of what it was in the previous battleground poll last fall, though that is most likely due, at least in part, to a change in the order of the questions asked.
A clear generational divide emerged in the surveys: Mr. Kennedy had more than twice as much support (15 percent) among voters under 45 as those over 45 (7 percent). Mr. Kennedy, 70, is younger than Mr. Trump, 77, and Mr. Biden, 81, but if elected he would still be one of the oldest presidents in U.S. history.
Mr. Kennedy entered the 2024 race as a Democrat running against Mr. Biden, and he received favorable coverage in conservative news outlets. The tenor has shifted now that he threatens Mr. Trump as well.
He appears to be siphoning support from some natural Trump constituencies, too. He garnered 13 percent support among the voters who said the country's political and economic systems need to be torn down entirely.
With his famous Democratic last name, Mr. Kennedy is emerging as a force of unpredictability in an election that strategists in both parties expect to be extremely close. He is both a possible outlet for voters frustrated with Mr. Biden but unready to make the leap to Mr. Trump and an option for those unhappy with Mr. Trump but unwilling to cast a ballot for Mr. Biden.
Chantel Turk, a dance studio owner in Marietta, Ga., said she did not have faith in Mr. Trump or Mr. Biden, so "by default" she was backing Mr. Kennedy. An independent voter, Ms. Turk said she might not vote at all if Mr. Kennedy did not make the ballot in Georgia, frustrated by the lack of progress toward "equality for Black people or women in this country."
"I'm just not seeing much change," said Ms. Turk, 33. "I haven't seen change since I started voting, so I'm losing faith in the system."
The poll was not one survey but six different ones across Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Mr. Biden won all six states in 2020 but was now trailing everywhere but Wisconsin among registered voters.
Mr. Kennedy's support was remarkably consistent. He never scored below 9 percent or above 12 percent in any of the six states, with his backers spread evenly across cities, suburbs and rural areas, and among high-income and lower-wage workers.
Mr. Kennedy's effect on the Biden-Trump contest, however, did differ by state.
In Michigan, Mr. Kennedy's inclusion helped Mr. Biden narrow his gap with Mr. Trump among registered voters, by five percentage points. But in Wisconsin, Nevada and Arizona, Mr. Trump's lead expanded by two percentage points when Mr. Kennedy was included.
When the survey considered only likely voters, Mr. Biden was narrowly leading in Michigan -- but losing in Wisconsin.
It was not clear precisely what was causing the differences between the states.
What was clear was that six months out from the election, Mr. Kennedy's support appears far more fragile than that of the two major candidates. Roughly 90 percent of supporters of the current or former president said they were very likely or almost certain to vote. But only two-thirds of Mr. Kennedy's supporters said the same. And only 29 percent of Kennedy supporters said they were "definitely" backing him this fall -- compared with roughly 80 percent who said that among Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump's backers.
That leaves plenty of room for both Democrats and Republicans to define Mr. Kennedy, and to try to win back their traditional supporters.
Those efforts have already begun. Mr. Trump and his allies are pushing to define Mr. Kennedy as a liberal ("R.F.K. and Biden are competing for who is further left," Donald Trump Jr. said on his streaming program last week). Democrats cast him as a MAGA-backed right-wing plant. The Democratic National Committee has established an entire team to undercut Mr. Kennedy's support.
Mr. Biden's support in the multicandidate field -- 33 percent -- is identical to his support in Times/Siena polling of battleground states in November. Mr. Trump's support has risen to 40 percent from 35 percent.
For Mr. Kennedy, the next big hurdle is actually getting on the ballot. Of the six battleground states surveyed, he has so far qualified only for Michigan's ballot.
Mr. Kennedy is not as widely known as Mr. Trump or Mr. Biden. But he is better liked. Of the three, Mr. Kennedy was the only candidate whom more voters felt favorably toward than not -- 41 percent were favorable, compared with 38 percent who were unfavorable.
"I just am so sick of Republicans versus Democrats," said Adam Bogues, 33, who is the general manager of a cannabis dispensary near Grand Rapids, Mich. "I'm just trying to break away from the same things that we've been getting for the past, you know, at least since I've been around, the last 33 years."
Mr. Kennedy was viewed most positively by the youngest voters, with roughly twice as many people under 30 rating him favorably than not.
Of all the swing states, Mr. Biden performed the weakest, and Mr. Kennedy the strongest, in Nevada, which is disproportionately diverse and young. The president's 27 percent support -- in a state he won in 2020 -- was roughly halfway between Mr. Trump's 41 percent and Mr. Kennedy's 12 percent.
"This is going to be basically my first election that I'm going to be able to vote, and I think it's going to be very important because, you know, my vote might make a difference," said Fabiola Ruiz Gomez, 44, a Democrat who lives in Las Vegas and became a U.S. citizen a few years ago.
Ms. Ruiz Gomez is leaning toward Mr. Kennedy. She has never been to one of his events but has started tracking him on social media, watching his videos and weighing his positions. "He's addressing the situation with the housing crisis," she said, adding, "The prices are insane. The interest rate is insane."
But if Mr. Kennedy does not make the ballot in Nevada?
"I'm going to need to vote for Biden," she said, "because I don't want Trump."

Here are the key things to know about how these polls were conducted:
We spoke with 4,097 registered voters in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin from April 28 to May 9, 2024.
Our polls are conducted by telephone, using live interviewers, in both English and Spanish. Nearly 95 percent of respondents were contacted on a cellphone for this poll. You can see the exact questions that were asked and the order in which they were asked here.
Voters are selected for the survey from a list of registered voters. The list contains information on the demographic characteristics of every registered voter, allowing us to make sure we reach the right number of voters of each party, race and region. For this set of polls, we placed nearly 500,000 calls to about 410,000 voters.
To further ensure that the results reflect the entire voting population, not just those willing to take a poll, we give more weight to respondents from demographic groups underrepresented among survey respondents, like people without a college degree. You can see more information about the characteristics of our respondents and the weighted sample on the methodology page, under "Composition of the Sample."
When the states are joined together, the margin of sampling error among registered voters is plus or minus 1.8 percentage points. Each state poll has a margin of error ranging from plus or minus 3.6 points in Pennsylvania to plus or minus 4.6 points in Georgia. In theory, this means that the results should reflect the views of the overall population most of the time, though many other challenges create additional sources of error. When computing the difference between two values -- such as a candidate's lead in a race -- the margin of error is twice as large.
You can see full results and a detailed methodology here. If you want to read more about how and why we conduct our polls, you can see answers to frequently asked questions and submit your own questions here.
The New York Times/Philadelphia Inquirer/Siena College poll of Pennsylvania was funded by a grant from The Lenfest Institute for Journalism. The poll was designed and conducted independently from the institute.

Kennedy is not as widely known as Trump or Biden. But he is better liked. Of the three, Kennedy was the only candidate whom more voters felt favorably toward than not: 41% were favorable, compared with 38% who were unfavorable.
“I just am so sick of Republicans versus Democrats,” said Adam Bogues, 33, who is the general manager of a cannabis dispensary near Grand Rapids, Michigan. “I’m just trying to break away from the same things that we’ve been getting for the past, you know, at least since I’ve been around, the last 33 years.”
Kennedy was viewed most positively by the youngest voters, with roughly twice as many people younger than 30 rating him favorably than not.
Of all the swing states, Biden performed the weakest, and Kennedy the strongest, in Nevada, which is disproportionately diverse and young. The president’s 27% support — in a state he won in 2020 — was roughly halfway between Trump’s 41% and Kennedy’s 12%.
“This is going to be basically my first election that I’m going to be able to vote, and I think it’s going to be very important because, you know, my vote might make a difference,” said Fabiola Ruiz Gomez, 44, a Democrat who lives in Las Vegas and became a U.S. citizen a few years ago.
Ruiz Gomez is leaning toward Kennedy. She has never been to one of his events but has started tracking him on social media, watching his videos and weighing his positions. “He’s addressing the situation with the housing crisis,” she said, adding, “The prices are insane. The interest rate is insane.”
But if Kennedy does not make the ballot in Nevada?
“I’m going to need to vote for Biden,” she said, “because I don’t want Trump.”

Here are the key things to know about how these polls were conducted:
— We spoke with 4,097 registered voters in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin from April 28 to May 9, 2024.
— Our polls are conducted by telephone, using live interviewers, in both English and Spanish. Nearly 95% of respondents were contacted on a cellphone for this poll.
— Voters are selected for the survey from a list of registered voters. The list contains information on the demographic characteristics of every registered voter, allowing us to make sure we reach the right number of voters of each party, race and region. For this set of polls, we placed nearly 500,000 calls to about 410,000 voters.
— To further ensure that the results reflect the entire voting population, not just those willing to take a poll, we give more weight to respondents from demographic groups underrepresented among survey respondents, like people without a college degree.
— When the states are joined together, the margin of sampling error among registered voters is plus or minus 1.8 percentage points. Each state poll has a margin of error ranging from plus or minus 3.6 points in Pennsylvania to plus or minus 4.6 points in Georgia. In theory, this means that the results should reflect the views of the overall population most of the time, though many other challenges create additional sources of error. When computing the difference between two values — such as a candidate’s lead in a race — the margin of error is twice as large.
The New York Times/Philadelphia Inquirer/Siena College poll of Pennsylvania was funded by a grant from The Lenfest Institute for Journalism. The poll was designed and conducted independently from the institute.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When the far-left politicians Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley were first elected to Congress roughly half a decade ago, many moderate Democrats saw their unapologetically progressive vision for America as an albatross around the neck of the Democratic Party.
That certainly seemed to be the view of Democratic leaders, who seemed intent on making the Squad, as the progressive caucus is known, a group of permanent outsiders.
"All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world," Nancy Pelosi, then speaker of the House, told Maureen Dowd in 2019. "But they didn't have any following," Ms. Pelosi said of the squad. "They're four people, and that's how many votes they got." At the time, Ms. Pelosi was bristling from criticism the progressive members had levied against her over her support for a funding bill the progressives said failed to protect migrant children, a major issue during the Trump presidency.
Five years later, Ms. Pelosi has stepped down from the leadership position she long held. The House progressive caucus has grown to nearly 100 members and has become a significant force in the party. The progressives have outlasted not only Ms. Pelosi but also moderate Democrats like Representative Steny Hoyer, who has also bowed out of his role leading House Democrats. Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the new minority leader, isn't a member of the progressive caucus. (He left the caucus when he became leader of the House Democrats.) But he has been far friendlier to the group's members and their agenda than Ms. Pelosi -- a nod to the blossoming role of progressive politics within the Democratic Party and its voter base.
And in recent months, the insurgent group of unapologetic leftists has gained even more sway within the Democratic Party. Some of this is clearly a reaction to the extremism of Trumpism and far-right House Republicans. But the progressives have gained power in Washington amid rising anger over the U.S. role in Gaza.
For the first time in decades, possibly since the anti-Vietnam War and environmental movements, the left wing has led the center of the Democratic Party in a new political direction on a major issue -- one sharply critical of the Israeli government, impatient with the leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and increasingly willing to use American leverage to curb Israel's military plans.
In recent weeks, Democratic leaders have begun inching closer to the progressive view that it is against U.S. interests to continue sending unconditional U.S. military aid to Mr. Netanyahu's government in an asymmetrical war that has killed thousands of innocent civilians in Gaza. And they have recognized that anger among Democratic voters -- especially young voters -- over the U.S. role in Gaza is a serious threat to President Biden's re-election that cannot be ignored.
In March, Senator Charles Schumer of New York, a staunch supporter of Israel, signaled an increasingly unified view of the conflict within the Democratic Party when he called for Israeli elections to replace Mr. Netanyahu. "The Netanyahu coalition no longer fits the needs of Israel after Oct. 7," Mr. Schumer said in a March 14 speech that stunned the political world.
Progressives have cheered the shift.
"We stood our ground on this issue since Day 1," Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts told me. "Today our vision is a part of that mainstream political discourse, and the party is responding." She said it was not only Gaza but also other issues, including student debt relief, that have contributed to the rising influence of progressives on Capitol Hill. "People want a Democratic Party that fights," she said.
Shortly after the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas, such a transformation in the Democratic Party looked extremely unlikely. In the first days after Israel invaded Gaza last fall, progressives like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez were calling for a cease-fire, a position that, in the wake of the horrific attacks on Israelis, seemed far out of step with much of the Democratic Party.
Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, another progressive Democrat, accused Israel of threatening actions that amounted to war crimes. Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, a progressive Democrat and the only Palestinian American member of Congress, has described Israel's longstanding approach to the conflict as apartheid. For months, Mr. Biden and the mainstream of the Democratic Party treated these views as unwelcome and extreme. Outside Biden campaign events, protests against the war were also largely ignored.
Six months later, though, the political landscape looks drastically different. When Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, speaking on the House floor on March 22, described the war in Gaza as an "unfolding genocide" against the Palestinian people, the Democratic House leadership barely blinked.
"A lot of what I was trying to do was legitimize this position," Ms. Ocasio-Cortez told me in a recent interview. "That it's not just like some fringe-activist thing."
The Democrats who are now openly talking about putting conditions on aid to Israel are hardly on the fringe. They include mainstream senators like Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Chris Coons of Delaware, Peter Welch of Vermont, Tina Smith of Minnesota and Chris Murphy of Connecticut. Representative Gregory Meeks of New York, the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and a longtime supporter of Israel, said he would not support the sale of F-15 fighter jets and munitions to Israel until he received assurances Israel would do more to reduce civilian deaths and increase the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza.
Even at the White House, it's clear the language surrounding the conflict has shifted. In a phone call with Mr. Netanyahu on April 4, the day after the killing of seven World Central Kitchen workers in Gaza by Israeli forces, Mr. Biden told the Israeli leader he would attach conditions to U.S. military support if more was not done to protect civilians and allow humanitarian aid into Gaza.
Partly, the drift away from decades-old American foreign policy is a reflection of the enormous death toll and suffering in Gaza, where tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians have been killed, as well as the intransigence of the right-wing Israeli government. But it is also a mark of the growing influence of American progressives on the Democratic Party.
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, for example, was taking on the role of not only an organizer in recent months but also a fund-raiser: She gave $ 260,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee this year; a spokesman said her PAC, Courage to Change, has more than $ 500,000 on hand that it plans to put toward the campaigns of progressive House Democrats facing serious challenges this cycle. It was her first contribution to a core of the party, moving her from an outsider to an important influencer. This kind of fund-raising, if it continues, could put progressives in a position to play a growing role in the Democratic Party, displacing the aging centrists.
On Israel, the pressure from the left has been clear: protests by young Americans and many others against the U.S. role in the conflict; an "uncommitted" movement that led thousands of Democrats to cast protest ballots instead of voting for Mr. Biden, especially in Michigan, a key swing state; and an intense, behind-the-scenes lobbying effort at the White House and in Congress by progressive Democrats.
One reason this had seemed improbable was divisive language on the left, including phrases like "from the river to the sea," which some view as a call for Palestinian rights but others see as an antisemitic call for the erasure of the state of Israel.
This language was at best unhelpful. In the shadow of the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust and amid rising antisemitism on and off campuses, it often felt deeply offensive. If American progressives are serious about driving foreign policy on Israel, they will have to find a way to strongly confront any antisemitism in their coalition.
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez acknowledged that antisemitism was on the rise but said the progressive movement is operating in a "tinderbox situation" in which groups like AIPAC, a pro-Israel lobby, have used unfair accusations of antisemitism to silence any criticism of the Israeli government.
"Two things can be true at the same time," she said. "You have a lot of cynical weaponization of false accusations and conflating of criticism of Israel with antisemitism, alongside the fact that antisemitism is very real and on the rise."
The long-term political strategy behind the uncommitted movement remains unclear. If it continues into the November election, it could help put Donald Trump in the White House, imperiling American democracy, never mind the progressive agenda.
Allies of the movement, though, say the U.S. role in Gaza has become too personal to ignore. "I have constituents who've lost dozens of their family members," Ms. Omar said. "They've been killed with weapons provided by their own tax dollars."
In classified briefings, at the White House and in scores of private conversations with other Democrats, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez pushed hard for a permanent end to hostilities and conditions for military aid.
"There was no lack of outside organizing, but I don't feel like there were enough inside voices that were able to get through these halls of power, particularly to people who disagreed with us," Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. "And so I decided to dedicate a lot of time and energy to really spending a lot of time in those spaces."
She also said she sat with families of the Israeli hostages and was alarmed by the rise antisemitic attacks, especially in New York City, part of which she represents.
On the campaign trail and at the White House over the past six months, decades of fixed American foreign policy on Israel were suddenly tested like never before. In swing states across the country, large groups of antiwar protesters stalked campaign events. In Washington, Biden administration officials began receiving phone calls from members like Ms. Pressley, who for weeks pestered the White House with constant requests for aid on behalf of a single Palestinian American family, the Okals, that was trapped in Gaza.
Representative Sara Jacobs of California, the youngest Jewish member of Congress and a Democratic member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, has also lobbied her colleagues. She said the administration should enforce the Foreign Assistance Act, which bars the United States from giving arms to any country that impedes humanitarian aid, as Ms. Jacobs said she believes Israel has done.
"A lot of people think that any criticism of Israel is antisemitic," Ms. Jacobs told me, adding that she has family in Israel. "I have been working very hard to try and carve out that space where there are legitimate criticisms."
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said her decision to publicly call the war in Gaza a genocide was driven largely by reports of imminent famine among Palestinians in the enclave amid what she said she believes to be the intentional blocking of humanitarian aid by Mr. Netanyahu.
Before giving the speech on the House floor, she said, she carefully considered other factors as well, including rising antisemitic attacks and the history of genocide against Jewish communities. She also said she spoke with a close childhood friend who is a survivor of the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
"I said, you know, 'What do you think would have been helpful?"' the congresswoman recalled. "And my friend told me that people need to see these folks as human. That's why I chose to use the images and in my speech to discuss what famine means."
Much is at stake at home as well, where U.S. policy toward Israel could sap the Democratic Party of its moral force -- among its greatest assets in the battle against Trumpism -- ahead of a crucial November election.
But if progressives and mainstream Democrats can continue to find common ground, that policy might really change. That may save lives and heal a painful and politically dangerous fracture in the Democratic coalition.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: I should have seen it coming last year when my editors put the following headline on my attempt to name the city's greatest places to eat: "The 100 Best Restaurants in New York City 2023."
That "2023" implies doing it again in 2024. Still, when they told me that's exactly what they wanted, my first reaction was surprise. This was followed by the realization that I had a lot of eating to do.
Twenty-two places in this edition of "The 100 Best Restaurants in NYC" are new. I've eaten at all 100 in the past 12 months, except for La Piraña Lechonera and the Queens Night Market, both of which are currently closed for the season. (As with all my reviews, I pay the check; we don't accept free meals.)
New York is a big city, and I tried to find 100 restaurants that represent its neighborhoods, its people and the rewards it has in store for hungry, curious eaters. The list is a tour. If you take it, you'll see all five boroughs and a wide array of cooking and serving styles.
There are hushed counters where fewer than 10 people at a time enjoy the marvels a great sushi master can conjure, and open-air stalls where jerk chicken soaks up the smoke of hardwood charcoal. And quite a few restaurants in between.
Not many people will eat at all of them. But if you read about them, I hope you will start to see New York the way I see it whenever I look at my options and ask myself where I am going to eat next. 1.
Tatiana by Kwame Onwuachi
Upper West Side, Manhattan
American, Caribbean, Creole
$ $ $ $
Go ahead, ask Resy to ping you when a table at Tatiana becomes available. You might as well learn Icelandic while you're at it, because you're going to be waiting a while. Deep into its second year, after much of the hype about Mr. Onwuachi's spirited rundown of Black cooking styles in New York (Southern, Caribbean, West African, bodega-esque) has blown over, Tatiana remains among the very few places in town where reservations are truly hard to come by. It's quickly becoming an institution. Is it maturing, too? The truffled chopped cheese is now a satisfying and rather lush steak sandwich, a more fully realized recipe even though it may no longer quite qualify as a chopped cheese. Service can still register as under-rehearsed. Yet the people working at Tatiana, many of them newcomers in the restaurant trade, convey genuine warmth and enthusiasm, which I'll gladly take over the chilly formalities that prevail in other restaurants that charge this much or more for dinner. Mr. Onwuachi clearly wants you to have fun at Tatiana, but I suspect he also wants you to ask why there aren't more places like it.

Blanca
Bushwick, Brooklyn
Seasonal, Tasting Menu
$ $ $ $
When the tasting counter in Roberta's backyard finally reopened in January, it had something to show for its unusually long pandemic break: a new chef, Victoria Blamey. She works with Carlo Mirarchi, Blanca's owner, within the nominally Italian outlines he established in its first decade: the esoteric raw seafood plates, the unexpected vegetable courses, the spare and thrilling bowls of pasta, the remarkable cuts of meat aged on site and painstakingly cooked over Japanese charcoal. But she builds on that structure, adding the intense flavors she loves (often from fermentation, as in the yuzu sauerkraut draped over raw surf clams) and some dishes drawn from the Chilean cuisine she grew up with (like tortilla de rescoldo, a flat and nearly black bread traditionally baked in ashes). Her far-reaching and forward-looking menu is served to a soundtrack provided by an open turntable and a stack of LPs. This has to be the only restaurant in the world where you can play side B of "Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves" while you wait for the pheasant course.

Le Bernardin
Midtown, Manhattan
French, Seafood, Tasting
$ $ $ $
You can drop in for a fairly quick lunch, not the whole multi-installment chef's tasting megillah, just a simple three courses for $ 127, in and out, no big deal, and still the cooking will make you feel as if tectonic plates were shifting under your feet. In January, what did it for me was the fluke. Boring old fluke, served all over town, where's the thrill in that, Eric Ripert? And then one of the servers fills the white space around the fish with a sauce the color of saffron. It smells like fennel and lobster. The inspiration is bouillabaisse, right, but (tremor) why is it so briny and (rumble) rich and hey, um, is that (people run for cover ...) sea urchin?

Atomix
NoMad, Manhattan
Korean, Tasting
$ $ $ $
At this point Manhattan must have more Korean tasting counters than kosher delis. Atomix remains the one to beat, though, the leader in finding new ingredients (locally foraged pineapple weed and maple flower are on the spring menu), grounding its experiments in tradition and putting its meals into the larger context of Korean ceramics, fabrics and even chopstick design. The concrete dining room is more chilly than cuddly, but it has little of the pretension that afflicts some other tasting counters. Its earnestness is surprisingly appealing.

Via Carota
West Village, Manhattan
Italian
$ $ $ $
Maybe you waited two hours for a table, maybe you lucked into a bar stool, maybe you took a reservation at one of those in-between times that are the only ones that ever seem to be offered. (At 4:15 p.m., are you having lunch or dinner?) In any case, as you hold up the broadsheet menu with its drawings of artichokes and figs, the old favorites compete for your attention: the crisp olives stuffed with pork, bruschetta under mounds of butter with a folded silvery anchovy on each mound, the slick tangle of tonnarelli studded with explosively fragrant peppercorns, the spreadably soft garlic cloves with golden sections of fried rabbit. There may not be another restaurant in town where so many dishes are indisputable classics, where, just when you think you've made up your mind, your eye falls on the meatballs sweetened with raisins and pine nuts ...

La Piraña Lechonera
Puerto Rican
South Bronx
$
Each winter, the rickety, boarded-up trailer on East 152nd Street looks as if it won't survive the next strong breeze. And each spring, Angel Jimenez unlocks the door, heats the deep fryer, powers up the salsa music, sharpens the machete and brings the city's greatest expression of Puerto Rican eating back to life for another season. The frituras, little shrimp-filled pastelillos and shiny golden bacalaitos, are superb. So is the cold octopus salad, crunchy with diced peppers and olives. But the reason we wait all winter for La Piraña's return is the roast pork. Rubbed with garlic and pepper, splashed with milky garlic sauce and, if you like, some vinegar-and-chile solution swirled in an empty rum bottle, it is the closest a New Yorker can get to a plate of slow-cooked lechon up in the mountains outside San Juan.

Semma
Indian
Greenwich Village, Manhattan
$ $ $
The city hasn't quite caught up with Semma yet. To some extent we can blame the Unapologetic Foods group, which opens restaurants faster than Guided by Voices puts out albums. But the real issue is that we haven't seen anything like Vijay Kumar's interpretations of South Indian food before. Mr. Kumar doesn't just toy with the distinction between refined and rustic; he obliterates it. The North Fork snails he sautées with tomatoes and tamarind would be cooked over a campfire in the rice paddies of Tamil Nadu, yet they get along with a glass of Pouilly-Fuissé from the Mâcconais as readily as any Burgundian escargot.

Superiority Burger
East Village, Manhattan
Diner, Vegetarian
$ $
Diner, vegetarian hangout, greenmarket evangelist, laboratory, improv collective, museum of East Village ephemera -- ever since it moved to Avenue A last year, Superiority Burger has been trying out new personas, without discarding any of the old ones. The exceptional, airy focaccia that is the focus of a sizable cult is now sold by the slice, but only at the bar on Monday and Tuesday. Grab-and-go veggie burgers, "hippy poutine" and fried tofu sandwiches that turn every preconception about bean curd on its head are available on Thursday, Friday and Saturday after 11 p.m. (During this "Night Shift," you can also eat a pie from the celebrated Chrissy's Pizza pop-up, as long as you ordered ahead.) There is no time of day when you can't get gelato and sorbet in freethinking flavors like saffron-labneh or tahini with fudge swirl. Waffles and other breakfast foods now materialize on weekends. Is this any way to run a hamburger stand? Yes, it is.

Yoshino
NoHo, Manhattan
Japanese, Tasting
$ $ $ $
At his counter on the Bowery, Tadashi Yoshida can wow you into submission before he hands you the night's first piece of sushi. Your omakase dinner might begin with a small cocktail of caviar and bigfin reef squid in sweet and tender strands. Mochi might follow, grilled over charcoal until crisp and chewy, then wrapped around sun-dried mullet roe, briny and intense. During certain weeks of the year there could be white sacs of cod milt. Or oysters and tilefish in a rich, breathtaking soup made from hairy crab. Mr. Yoshida's appetizer repertoire seems to be endless. By the time he fills a brazier with live charcoal to sear the mackerel sushi that is his signature, showstopping dish, your surrender is complete.

Torrisi Bar & Restaurant
NoLIta, Manhattan
Italian
$ $ $ $
Torrisi is now turning out the most dazzling and accomplished cooking of all the Major Food Group restaurants. (The distinction used to belong to the Grill, which this year slides to No. 55 in my ranking.) Who knows what the future holds? But Rich Torrisi, standing in one corner of the open kitchen, conducting a crew that is equally adept with Vietnamese octopus as with tortellini folded as gracefully as a silk pocket square, certainly looks like a chef who has found his forever home.

Estela
NoLIta, Manhattan
Seasonal, New American
$ $ $
The food seems slightly more familiar than it did when Ignacio Mattos brought Estela to Houston Street in 2013. One reason for this is that small-plates restaurants across the country have helped themselves to its unexpected flavor harmonies and unforced visual aesthetic. Some even lifted entire recipes. Never mind the imitators, though. An Estela dish can still knock you over with originality. Where else can you get orange segments under a floss of dried shrimp and Thai chile threads? Nowhere, yet.

Una Pizza Napoletana
Lower East Side, Manhattan
Pizza
$ $
A couple of years ago, Una Pizza was half-empty so often that its owner, Anthony Mangieri, was thinking of pulling up stakes. Then he did an about-face -- or maybe we did. Now, he and his pizza are acknowledged downtown institutions. Fans buy Una Pizza-branded apparel, extra-virgin olive oil and panettone; they begin lining up half an hour before the doors open; and they've made reservations among the city's most scalpable. The source of this fevered loyalty is the five standard pies and a weekly special, all of them with a fat, tender, char-speckled Hula-Hoop of dough surrounding a low valley of tomatoes or cheese or both. There's not much else on the menu, but the fire-roasted peppers are worthwhile and the sorbetto can be stunning.
13.

Ci Siamo
Chelsea, Manhattan
Italian
$ $ $ $
I know people who refused to try Ci Siamo for a while because it's located in Nowheresville -- the concrete future-scape known as Manhattan West. Then they went, and they got lost. They complained about the schlep before, during and after the next visit. But when they found themselves planning a third meal, they were forced to admit that Hillary Sterling has put Nowheresville on the map. There are other chefs in town with a wood-burning hearth and a love of rustic Italian flavors, but Ms. Sterling's menu may have the highest percentage of dishes that are flat-out fantastic.

It can be depressing when restaurants are cloned, but for Jean-Georges Vongerichten there were undeniable advantages to making a branch of ABCV out of his vegetarian hide-out, Seeds & Weeds, in the Tin Building. For one, an outright copy can be better than a halfhearted imitation. ABCV's executive chef, Neal Harden, has spent years studying interesting ways to eat grains, roots, fungi and so on. His food is so much more advanced than it is at other, similar places that eating there can be like time-traveling and discovering that the post-livestock future turned out extremely well. If ABCV can be cloned successfully, we may not need to clone meat.

The cooking of Jiangnan, including Shanghai and the cities of the southern Yangtze Delta, gets the nuanced treatment it deserves at CheLi. Instead of, say, scorching chiles or other powerful seasonings, Jiangnan uses Shaoxing wine to provide subtle, invisible emphasis in many dishes, like chilled wine-soaked crab and stir-fried loofah. Dragonwell tea scents the soft curls of sweet Longjing shrimp, which come to the table enveloped in dry-ice fog. Delicate is probably not the best word for CheLi's mao xue wang, a majestic stew of ham, beef, shrimp, intestines and congealed duck's blood, all bobbing under a quarter-inch or so of chile oil. But it's not wrong, either.

Getting a table is no easy feat, but apart from that, Jeju is one of the city's most accessible modern Korean restaurants -- a crowded category that has more than its share of tasting menus with triple-digit prices. The quietly marvelous mushroom ramen, with Parmesan foam and a squeeze of lime, is a meal in itself, and costs $ 27. For about the same price there are seafood appetizers, such as rosy cubes of raw kinmedai and clams in a dill- and chive-scented broth, so carefully considered they could be airlifted right into a 12-course degustation, although they'd probably have to be a tenth the size.

Whatever picture floats through your mind when you think of a rock star's restaurant, it probably doesn't resemble the Four Horsemen, owned in part by James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem. There is no grandstanding, no concert memorabilia and very little debauchery unless you count the four-top of wine-business insiders in the back drinking magnums of organic, wild-fermented Champagne from Georges Laval. What the restaurant does have is a low-key obsession with excellence. You see it in the attention to brewing tea and coffee, in the basket-drained ricotta made daily in kitchen, in the unfussy seasonality of Nick Curtola's menus, and in the way the servers seem to know all about the wines but aren't in a rush to prove it. Like everything else at this serious little restaurant, it just seems to happen naturally.

Sometimes when I land at JFK, I am tempted to make the 10-minute drive to Trinciti so I can refresh myself with two or three Trini chicken curry doubles and a couple of aloo pies, slit open and filled with shrimp and tamarind chutney. But the sad truth is that I'm always too tired from traveling, and there's no place to sit at Trinciti. Plus, you need your wits about you simply to order, particularly on the weekend, when there is one line for bake and shark, another for all the other food, and a third to pay. Friday, Saturday and Sunday are the only days you can get bake and shark -- spicy, sweet, tangy and crunchy in about five different ways, it is the greatest fish sandwich in the five boroughs. So I treat Trinciti as a destination of its own, worth a separate trip.

By this point, Jean-Georges Vongerichten shouldn't have any tricks left up his sleeve. But a six- or 10-course dinner at his urbane, understated restaurant on Columbus Circle is almost sure to deliver something you didn't quite see coming. Wagyu tenderloin with braised endive might look like a simple steakhouse riff, but how can that sticky and intensely fruity hoisin sauce get along so well with a jus that carries the fragile perfume of bergamot? How can citrus segments, spicy Fresno chiles and shiso oil be piled on top of raw scallops without crushing their sweetness? Sean Considine, the pastry chef, makes sure the surprises start up again with dessert and continue through the final barrage of marshmallows, pâtes de fruits and chocolates.

Mam is still something of a rough draft, but it is looking more and more like a serious restaurant. True, the miniature kitchen, miniature dining room and miniature plastic furniture were part of what made Mam so charming in its early days on Forsyth Street, when Jerald and Nhung Dao Head were dishing out Hanoi-style bun dau mam tom to a small audience at what seemed to be a pop-up. The crowds grew as word got out about the housemade fried tofu, the blood sausage, the fish mint and other Vietnamese herbs, and the fermented shrimp sauce that made everything taste better. But crowds and small quarters are not made for each other. Last year, the Heads signed a lease on a space next door. Meanwhile, Mr. Head has been adding to his repertory, applying his obsessive, detail-oriented attention to, among other things, a pho bo that rivals his bun dau mam tom.

According to the second law of thermodynamics, exciting young restaurants are doomed to become less exciting with age. At 20 years old, Casa Mono and its wine-bar annex next door, Bar Jamón, gracefully defy that law every day. Andy Nusser hasn't lost his appreciation for the strong, elemental flavors of Spanish cuisine: smoky eggplant purée beneath fried baby squid; the paprika blast of the raw, spreadable pork sausage sobrasada, to be smeared on golden toast with waxy chunks of honeycomb. The nose-to-tail fad has come and gone, and Casa Mono sails on placidly, flying the flag of lambs' tongues and pigs' ears. The wine list has grown to about 600 Spanish bottles: serious Cava, aged Rioja and avant-gardists from all over.

He never stops moving. All night he's turning, poking, relocating and examining chicken skewers, placing one over searing heat, letting another rest above a cooler patch of charcoal. His hypervigilance produces degrees of tenderness and juiciness and crunchiness that can make you feel as if you're eating chicken for the first time.

At Café Carmellini, you get to hear his voice. He's cooking in an elaborate, technically adroit style that he hasn't used much since his days working for Daniel Boulud. We tend to connect that style with dusty old recitations of haute cuisine, an association the silver domes and somewhat stilted service don't quite dispel. But there's nothing antiquated about Café Carmellini's food. It's fresh and sharp; he's having fun showing off skills you don't often see these days. Even when he blends French and Italian cuisines, not exactly an earth-shattering concept, he puts them together in his own way.

It is as close to a manifesto as we are likely to get from April Bloomfield, the gifted and non-loquacious chef at Sailor. What it might be saying: Creativity is overrated, details are everything, the best cooking is invisible, and the best cooks know when to get out of the way. You might come to the same conclusions on your own when you eat her roasted potatoes stuck to crisp wafers of toasted cheese, her warm hunks of celery root basted with melted butter, her smoked pork shoulder collapsing in on itself and her mahogany-dark caramel sauce clinging to crisp puffs of profiteroles.

For years, Persian food aficionados dreamed of finding a respectable tahdig in the city, or even an acceptable khoresh fesenjan. Today Sofreh, in Prospect Heights, makes those and other dishes in a traditional, homestyle form, while Eyval, in Bushwick, reimagines them as modern restaurant dishes. You can eat well in both restaurants, but when the mood for black lime and saffron strikes me, I'm more likely to head for Eyval. I appreciate the way Ali Saboor uses his wood oven to pin down the smoky character of Iran's street food. I like the way his boranis repurpose yogurt as a foil for seasonal vegetables. As for the tahdig, it's been edited down to the crunchy, golden quarter-inch at the bottom of the pan, exactly the thing that makes tahdig worth dreaming about.

You'd know, too, that the chefs, Jess Shadbolt and Clare de Boer, have noticed the way rough edges make things taste better. Much of the inspiration is southern French or northern Italian, but the, sensual allure of the food comes directly from cooks who know the value of crushing, smashing and tearing.

The tart and slightly funky counterpoint to halibut in a satiny beurre blanc is provided by a bed of fermented daikon, and the roast venison loin comes with a side of cabbage, draped in smoked cream, that's sort of astonishing.

Now led by Kannika Kittipinyovath, the kitchen of the Elmhurst original may have grown stingy with fresh herbs like holy basil, which once made Zaab Zaab's kapow so thrilling.

His jerk is tender and juicy, a goal that eludes many chefs. The jerk sauce achieves a taut balance of sugar, sourness and spice, and even seems to have caught some of the smoke itself. The impressively large rig on the side of Flatlands Avenue in Brooklyn, also used to roast ears of corn and whole sweet potatoes, is the center of the Forever Jerk universe.

Or the tender leeks vinaigrette, which the servers unwrap from a cloak of dark outer leek greens as ceremoniously as if they were presenting poularde de Bresse demi-deuil? Or the baba carved tableside and then hit with a healthy glug of génèpy or Chartreuse? Well, occasionally I'll hear from a reader who went to Le Rock with high hopes and felt ignored, lost in the shuffle, assaulted by the decibels. I'll apologize about the service and say that in my experience the room does seem to be getting quieter. But, I tell them, any good homage to the French brasserie needs to be a little loud for verisimilitude.

When the dining room is busy, which is just about always, it will be full of old Chinatown locals from Hong Kong, couples who think of Noodletown as their place, young social-media explorers ticking restaurants off their bucket list and older but equally clued-in tourists. These groups will overlap considerably with the soft-shell crab followers, the salt-and-pepper squid obsessives, the suckling pig appreciators, connoisseurs of Cantonese char siu, slurpers of wonton soup, and devotees of the restaurant's much-imitated ginger-scallion sauce.

The part of Brooklyn between Prospect Park and the Atlantic Ocean is a treasure land of food from the former Soviet republics. At Village Cafe, as with many other restaurants in the area, the kebabs are the backbone of the menu. But the Azerbaijani offerings extend well beyond meat on a stick: There are platters of plov, sweet with dried fruits; flatbreads stuffed with minced greens and fresh herbs; the daunting hash of livers, kidneys, hearts and testicles known as djiz-biz; and fat belts of pasta dressed with chopped lamb cooked in its own fat, a noodle dish that seems to stand exactly halfway between China and Italy.

Of all the restaurants washed up on the city's shores by the first wave of enthusiasm over New Nordic cooking, the most original, thoughtful and lasting has been Aska. Fredrik Berselius, raised in Sweden, built his own kitchen vocabulary by combining Scandinavian flavors with ingredients farmed or foraged around New York. His intricate, gentle tasting menus show a poet's feel for fleeting moments and the beauty lurking in nature. One long-running appetizer is a frond of fried bladderwrack daubed with drops of mussel emulsion that look like the plant's natural balloon structures. A wavy cup assembled from shaved walnuts makes an edible shell for a walnut tart. Even his caviar dishes seem to have been discovered somewhere in Middle-earth.

Instead of starting out slowly with an introductory Gildas for Dummies course, Alex Raij and Eder Montero immediately complicated the picture, inviting ingredients from China, Japan and beyond into the kitchen. Is there another Basque restaurant in the country where the Russian potato salad is augmented with bonito flakes and the boquerones are laid out over spearlike leaves of rau ram?

One downside of being widely imitated is that, years later, your original ideas can read like copies.

But nobody has figured out how to mimic Craft's ability to get maximal flavor with minimal means. The been-there-done-that feeling ends when you start eating.

It's hard to know what to make of a restaurant that gets rid of its single best feature, as Lodi did by closing the bakery that produced destination-quality breads and a flauto al cioccolato so precisely made that its lamination might have been designed by an architect. True, Lodi gained a few tables. Now it is easier to stroll in for elegant cafe dishes like bison tartare and chestnut gnocchi. And yes, drinking a spritz or a sbagliato while sitting on or looking out at Rockefeller Plaza produces a distinctly pleasurable shiver of the kind that only the world's great cities can provide. But we're still going to need some time to forget about that flauto.

The strange concrete bunker askew from the street grid looks even stranger now that a simple wooden porch has been hammered together. Yet this unprepossessing structure is a titan in Midwood's highly competitive pita-sandwich scene. There is no shawarma here as at Olympic Pita, no schnitzel as at Corner Street Food. This leaves Tanami free to concentrate on its marvelous pita and its falafel, which have brittle fried shells protecting a hot interior that is bright green with herbs. The sheer number of bins of chopped vegetables and salads can induce panic attacks, and many customers just ask for everything. A screaming yellow streak of amba sauce is probably mandatory.

The place is a cyclone of smoked-fish commerce on weekends and before any major Jewish holiday. On certain other days, a diner at Barney Greengrass can achieve a state close to serenity. There are eternal questions to contemplate: Sour cream or apple sauce? Nova or sturgeon? Toasted or untoasted? There are minor rituals to be observed -- the most sacred of all is laughing at the servers' jokes. Staring at the faded antebellum scenes of the French Quarter on the wallpaper can lead to the sensation that time has stopped moving forward. By your third cup of coffee and second order of latkes, it should be clear that you are sitting at the spiritual center of the Upper West Side.

Meals at AbuQir, a homage to the seafood stalls on the Mediterranean coast outside Alexandria, begin with a consultation over the whole fish and other seafood stretched out on ice in the back. You should probably walk in with a plan. But if the man who takes your order tells you the grilled scallops are excellent today, or if you were thinking baked porgy and he recommends the blackened branzino, you should throw your plan out the window. A sloshy, garlicky plate of baba ghanouj is a fine thing to dip bread into while your fish cooks; in fact, anything with eggplant is a good idea.

Hainan Chicken House
Sunset Park, Brooklyn
Malaysian
$ $
The poached chicken in the dish called Hainanese chicken rice tends to confuse people trying it for the first time. The ideal texture, which can strike novices as flabby and undercooked, is more important than the flavor, which is supposed to be mild verging on dull. The expectation is that the customer will go to town with the house sauces, which should not be dull at all, and that the chicken flavor that seems to be missing from the chicken itself will be supplied by the rice. The success of the dish, in other words, depends on a series of bank shots, which is one reason it's exciting to find it prepared as well as it is at Hainan Chicken House. For all that, this is not a one-dish specialist but one of the most impressive Malaysian restaurants New York has seen in years. The name may sell the kitchen short.

For some New Yorkers, Ayat's family-dinner mainstays, like the lamb stew mansaf, soured with dried yogurt, and the carefully layered chicken and vegetable dish called maklouba, will open new windows into Palestinian culture. For others, obviously, they will taste like home.

The great thing about tasting menus is that they act as a blank page that a chef can write anything on. The tragedy is how many chefs have nothing to say. Amanda Cohen does, though. Her five-course meals are like a night of one-act plays, or even comedy sketches, on the theme of vegetables. The cooks work on each dish until it's a self-contained routine. Crunchy Buffalo collard leaves are sprinkled with powdered hot sauce and served with celery and blue cheese dip, and a savory croissant with a mushroom mousse filling comes with a glass of cappuccino that turns out to be mushroom soup. It's dinner disguised as a continental breakfast.

At Llama Inn he mostly sticks with translating traditional dishes -- beef-heart anticuchos, scallop ceviche -- into modern restaurant terms. But he works well when he's staying within the lines, and there's no question that the space in Brooklyn is roomier and more comfortable, despite being a truncated triangle under the B.Q.E.

But one day you might find that you must have a tuna melt and that nothing else will do. On that day, I hope you remember to go to S & P, where you will be served a version made with terrific respect, from creamy and soft tuna salad on substantial rye bread. It will be better than you hoped, without deviating in any particular from what you were picturing. And this is true of almost more things on S & P's menu that you can count, including the Reuben, the meatloaf sandwich, the chopped liver, the pancakes and the egg and cheese on a roll with Taylor ham.

Last year, Alonso Guzman and Amy Hernandez followed the success of Mariscos El Submarino by opening a second restaurant, Mystica, in Greenpoint. It shows growth and ambition, with its careful plating and long-cooked pork shanks, and suggests these two restaurateurs could be around a while. But Mariscos El Submarino is still their shining contribution to the city, our most detailed and comprehensive tour of Sinaloa-style raw seafood. The aguachile negro, dark with soy sauce and undeniably spicy, has become something of a cult object, but the other aguachiles deliver jolts of their own, and there are equally good arguments for the ceviches, tostadas and tomato-red seafood cocktails in tall plastic cups.

We might also ask whether the vegetable sambar isn't a little watery. But then we'd remember that nothing on the menu costs more than $ 10, that the coconut chutney does seem to get better the more of it you eat and that the variety of dosas is sort of stunning, from chewy rava dosas to ice cream cone-shaped ghee roast dosas to paper dosas so long they sprawl from one end of a cafeteria tray to the other.

So when the chef, David Santos, cooks octopus Bolognese, the octopus will have been trapped in a clay pot in a sustainable Spanish fishery. When he roasts a turnip, it will be the elusive Gilfeather turnip, which for decades was cultivated exclusively by a secretive Vermont farmer who refused to share its history or its seeds with anyone.

Certainly it's the only restaurant in Queens that celebrates the start of maple sap season by staging a hockey game on the dining room floor. If you happen to go on a day when nothing in particular is happening, you'll still find dishes that seem to have been conceived for a feast like mortadella mille-feuille or half of a roasted piglet head on a plate.

Then we come to the Do-Rag pancake, the Bastard and the Wiggly Pete, and this is just on the first of the menu's two single-spaced pages. Every dish, no matter how weird it sounds, will turn out to be good, at a minimum, and a surprisingly large percentage of the goofiest ones have a stealthy sort of culinary intelligence.

But Randazzo's was put on this earth to serve fried calamari. If you don't understand how such a pedestrian dish could be the organizing principle of an entire restaurant, you probably haven't tasted the calamari at Randazzo's, or dipped it into the hot tomato sauce that seems to have been bubbling on the back of the stove all day, or wondered how the hunk of friselle, a kind of crouton buried under the pile of squid, somehow manages to be dry and wet at the same time.

Full text: Ayodele Casel leads a program celebrating Roach's centenary that also includes works by Rennie Harris as well as by Ronald K. Brown and Arcell Cabuag.
Nothing dates like technology. The video effects in the Kit Fitzgerald film that opens "Max Roach 100" at the Joyce Theater -- a centenary celebration of the great drummer, composer and activist -- are clearly from the 1980s. (Remember Max Headroom?) The performances of Roach that the film preserves, however, are timeless.
There he is, seated at his drum set, that American invention of the early 20th century, a jazz innovator handling the polyrhythms of several African drummers at once. There he is, proving his virtuosity by limiting his tools, playing nothing but a hi-hat in the manner of a hibachi chef. The video effects, making his drum sticks splash a rainbow, suggest his range of tone and timbre. But they don't come close to matching him.
What's thrilling about the dancers who perform live in "Max Roach 100" is that they rise to Roach's level. This is a fitting tribute and a hell of a show.
The tap dancer Ayodele Casel follows the film and raises the bar. The stage is set with a tap floor surrounded by lights and a clothes rack. Casel enters, chooses a jacket from the rack and sits to put on her tap shoes. Then she warms up a bit, testing out the various tones of the floor with her close-shave footwork. An artist prepares.
What she's preparing to do is crazy. The track she has chosen is one of the duets Roach recorded with the free-jazz pianist Cecil Taylor. Improvising on top of that is like dancing on top of a volcano. Casel makes it look easy -- floating, sliding, spanning the stage as much as Taylor does his 88 keys. She looks prepared. She looks liberated.
It's not just that she answers the sounds of Roach and Taylor. She turns their duet into a trio, a conversation between the living and the dead. Listening hard with her whole body, sometimes she follows faithfully. More amazingly, her free rhythms sometimes alter theirs, so that they seem to be following her.
For audience members, it takes a lot of concentration to keep up with this adventure. Lighting by Serena Wong shrewdly provides visual variety: squares of light, shadows reminiscent of Fred Astaire in "Swing Time." And Casel leavens the difficulty with wit. To show that she's aware that this kind of music could go on forever, she has the clothes rack and lights exit before she's finished, pulled off by unseen strings. On Wednesday, when the music was most cacophonous, she held her ground with the most basic time step.
Casel makes it tough for the other artists on the program. But the hip-hop master Rennie Harris answers the challenge with "Jim Has Crowed." He takes on the more activist side of Roach, choosing a track that combines Roach with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech and staging a protest.
To crowd noises ("Stop killing Black people!"), a dozen or so dancers from Harris's company, Puremovement, mass like protesters facing an unseen authority. Then Roach's drums kick in and we get the pleasure of synchronicity, footwork that perfectly tallies with Roach's rhythms.
Harris tempers this pleasure with skepticism about how much of King's dream has been fulfilled. The dancers flash Black Power fists and windmill their arms and even spin on their heads, but they keep rolling backward like tumbleweeds. After three men are shot, three women open their mouths in silent screams and rotate like lights in a lighthouse. Silent screams are usually an aesthetic error. These are justified.
The program saves the biggest for last. For "Percussion Bitter Sweet: Tender Warriors," Ronald K. Brown and Arcell Cabuag combine two companies -- Brown's troupe, Evidence, and Malpaso, from Cuba -- and take on Roach at his most Afro-Cuban.
This may be the biggest Brown dance ever, but it's a fairly generic one and a little blandly tender. Unlike in "Jim Has Crowed," women are underused, and too many of the dancers, and not just the Cubans, only approximate Brown's potent style, substituting blurriness for its loose grace. They sap the choreography of much of its kinesthetic charge.
But they do it with love. And when they switch from sleeveless dashikis and full-skirted dresses (by Ibiwunmi Omotayo Olaiya) that look like Christmas wrapping paper in Pan-African green and red into spiritually pure white, and dance the steps of Obatala, a Yoruban orisha, or spirit, it feels like the ancestors have arrived. It's easy to imagine Roach looking on with pride.

Former U.K. Tech Mogul Faces the Trial of His Life: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A criminal trial is set to begin for Mr. Lynch, the founder of the software company Autonomy, which was sold to Hewlett-Packard in 2011 and later accused of being a fraud.
Every morning in his townhouse in the tony San Francisco neighborhood of Pacific Heights, the man once referred to as Britain's Bill Gates gets to work.
That man, Mike Lynch, checks in with his investment firm, Invoke Capital, on its recent performance. He speaks with researchers in Cambridge, England, whom he funds personally, about the ways artificial intelligence could be used to help those with hearing difficulties. He receives updates on the heritage Red Poll cattle and other livestock at his farm in Suffolk, in the east of England.
Eventually, Mr. Lynch, 58, turns to his most important task: defending himself against 16 criminal counts of conspiracy and fraud. If convicted, he will face up to 20 years behind bars.
The trial begins on Monday in San Francisco, where federal prosecutors -- who extradited Mr. Lynch from Britain in May and placed him under house arrest -- have accused the former tech mogul of defrauding Hewlett-Packard of billions when he sold HP his software company, Autonomy, for $ 11 billion in 2011.
In 2012, HP announced an $ 8.8 billion write-down and blamed it on "serious accounting improprieties" at Autonomy. Stunned investors called it one of the worst acquisitions in history. Mr. Lynch has since waged a series of complex, overlapping legal battles in the United States and Britain.
In 2022, a London judge in a civil case found Mr. Lynch and Sushovan Hussain, Autonomy's former finance chief, liable for defrauding HP. The judge said the case was "amongst the longest and most complex in English legal history," with the trial running for more than three months, the presentation of tens of thousands of documents and, in the end, a ruling that ran to well over 1,000 pages.
Mr. Lynch contests HP's claims and plans to appeal the ruling. His lawyers called it "a case study in buyer's remorse," and point the finger at HP's executives for mismanaging Autonomy. Hearings were held last month to decide on damages, with HP seeking some $ 4 billion and Mr. Lynch arguing that he owed nothing.
Mr. Lynch's legal travails also serve as a reminder of the decline of Hewlett-Packard, a onetime titan of the U.S. technology industry. The former Silicon Valley giant has since split up, and has long been overshadowed by younger leviathans like Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft.
For his upcoming criminal trial, Mr. Lynch's odds do not look good. The judge, Charles Breyer of the Northern District of California, has dismissed some of the evidence Mr. Lynch's lawyers tried to introduce which they say showed that HP mismanaged Autonomy after acquiring the company. Judge Breyer also oversaw the trial of Mr. Hussain, who was convicted in 2018 of charges similar to those Mr. Lynch now faces. Mr. Hussain was recently released from a federal prison in Pennsylvania.
Last year, Mr. Lynch lost a bid to avoid extradition despite lobbying the British government, which had approved his transfer to the United States on the same day as the judgment against him in the civil case brought by HP.
Last month, he sued the Serious Fraud Office, Britain's securities regulator, over its handling of data requests by the United States government. The lawsuit, a last-ditch bid to delay the U.S. criminal trial, was settled earlier this month.
Mr. Lynch still wields considerable resources to defend himself in the San Francisco courtroom. "Mike Lynch has faith that he will be vindicated when he finally gets a chance to tell his story to a jury," Reid Weingarten, one of several prominent white-collar defense lawyers representing Mr. Lynch in the United States, said in a statement. "We look forward to this opportunity to tell Mike Lynch's story and allow him to put this unfortunate chapter behind him."
Since his extradition, Mr. Lynch has lived under 24-hour surveillance and court-mandated private security, a drastic fall for a man once considered one of Britain's biggest tech success stories.
Born into a working-class family outside of London, he attended private school on a scholarship and graduated from Cambridge before founding Autonomy in 1996. The company helped clients analyze unstructured information in order to unearth hidden insights about their businesses.
By 2011, Autonomy had become one of Britain's most prominent technology companies, with its home base of Cambridge sometimes called "Silicon Fen."
"He certainly raised the profile of Cambridge technology," said Tony Quested, the editor of Business Weekly, a technology trade publication based in Cambridge. "There wasn't that much around at the time."
Mr. Lynch became a celebrity in British tech circles. He was a member of the Royal Society, one of the country's top scientific associations; an adviser to David Cameron, the prime minister at the time; and sat on the board of the BBC.
HP, then led by Léo Apotheker, a former chief of the German software giant SAP, hit upon the notion of buying Autonomy to transform itself from an aging hardware provider to a higher-margin software company. HP agreed to buy Autonomy in mid-2011 for some 60 percent more than its market value.
Things soured quickly.
Mr. Apotheker was out as chief executive a month after the deal was announced, as investors and analysts revolted against both the high price of the Autonomy acquisition and a plan to spin off HP's personal computer division (which was born from another major takeover, of Compaq.)
He was replaced by Meg Whitman, the former eBay chief who sat on HP's board. Within HP, Autonomy's star quickly dimmed amid rapidly declining sales. Mr. Lynch, who clashed with Ms. Whitman, was fired in May 2012.
Later that year, HP said it had been duped by Autonomy, misled by improprieties including the backdating of contracts and the use of hardware sales to bolster revenue, particularly at the end of a quarter. The multibillion-dollar write-down marked the beginning of Mr. Lynch's legal travails, which will culminate this month in another long and complex trial.
Over the years, Mr. Lynch has denied the characterization that the company was riddled with fraud. He has blamed Ms. Whitman, now the United States ambassador to Kenya, and other senior executives who clashed with him, for Autonomy's disintegration. His lawyers have argued in court filings that HP executives, for example, knew about the hardware sales and hadn't raised them as an issue.
They have pointed to internal emails showing the shifting calculations of Autonomy's worth, at one point putting it at more than $ 11 billion. They have also noted that accountants for EY, the global accounting and consulting firm previously known as Ernst & Young, who were working for HP had not believed the Autonomy takeover price was inflated because of accounting irregularities.
U.S. federal prosecutors argued in court documents that Mr. Lynch, long known as a hard-charging boss, relished being tough and maintaining control. (In one filing, government lawyers described an internal sales video at Autonomy in which he portrayed himself as a Mafia don, and noted that he had named conference rooms after James Bond movie villains.) Witness depositions have included Ms. Whitman and Catherine Lesjak, HP's former chief financial officer.
The prosecutors have sought to introduce tens of thousands of exhibits and a 44-person witness list, and they estimate that the trial could last until the end of May.
Mr. Lynch's freedom, and his legacy, are at stake.
He has sought to foster a reputation as a public intellectual by giving interviews on the subject of technology, but has kept a low profile since his extradition. His last published piece was in April, when he encouraged British policymakers to embrace A.I. start-ups.
Autonomy is now part of the Canadian software company OpenText. Mr. Lynch's investment firm, Invoke, has made crucial early investments in companies like the cybersecurity provider Darktrace.
But associations with Mr. Lynch can be fraught. In December, Darktrace shareholders rejected a nominee for the board proposed by Invoke. And in the company's financial filings, Darktrace has described "Autonomy related matters" as a risk "from both a reputational and a legal perspective."

Full text: If I were a vegetable, I would hire cabbage's brand manager.
Cabbage has spent an eternity as the workhorse of the stir-fry and the braise, the quiet companion to endless duck legs and pulled pork sandwiches. It never complained, even when boiled with corned beef or shoved into a crock for months.
But today, a vegetable that can make your house smell like a 19th-century tenement is the darling of the culinary crowd.
Leaves of purple cabbage have been enlisted to swaddle mapo tofu at Poltergeist, the current culinary fascination in Los Angeles. At Superiority Burger in New York City, cabbage gently enrobes sticky rice studded with tofu and braised mushrooms.
Fancy dishes that cast cabbage in a leading role have been popular on the coasts for some time, but they're now making their way onto menus across the country. At Good Hot Fish in Asheville, N.C., shredded green cabbage stars in a pancake punched up with sorghum hot sauce. In Denver, Sap Sua sprinkles a charred wedge with anchovy breadcrumbs. Cabbage is bathed in brown-butter hollandaise at Gigi's Italian Kitchen in Atlanta.
"It's like bacon was in the 1990s," said Michael Stoltzfus, who has two cabbage dishes on his menu at Coquette in New Orleans.
Cabbage is just the latest celebrity in a family of hardy crucifers that help chefs and diners through the colder months when local produce is scarce. Arugula, kale and cauliflower have each had their star turn, but brussels sprouts, the modern menu darling that David Chang started pan roasting with bacon at Momofuku Noodle Bar in 2004, is perhaps the biggest gateway brassica of them all.
Cabbage has the advantage of being especially cheap and bountiful, with a long shelf life -- a single head seems to last forever in the refrigerator. It gained ground as American menus added creative dishes influenced by China, India and other Asian countries, where cabbage is an essential ingredient. Kimchi has helped mightily. Its meteoric rise has been buoyed -- much to the chagrin of some -- by the interest in all things fermented and gut-friendly.
Hearty Classics: Cabbage Recipes From NYT Cooking
With his Swiss-German heritage, Mr. Stoltzfus was a cabbage superfan before it was cool. "Everyone laughed at me for a long time," he said.
His big hit is a charred wedge of green cabbage perched on turnip ravigote and showered with Parmesan. At $ 15, the dish is a steady moneymaker at a time when restaurant budgets are particularly tight.
"It's something we joke about," he said. "Our best-selling appetizer is the thing we're most excited about, and also by far our best cost margin."
Still, some diners who don't have cabbage fever need to be convinced.
"For a regular person, cabbage is the last thing they go for when they see it on a menu because it's humble, like a potato," said Armen Ayvazyan, the chef at Chi Spacca, Nancy Silverton's Italian steakhouse in Los Angeles.
Plenty of people order his $ 18 contribution to cabbage's rehabilitation: a wedge of tender, cone-shaped cabbage stuffed with 'nduja. It comes to the table on a pool of taleggio fondue ringed with green scallion oil.
Cabbage has been a global culinary workhorse for centuries. (China grows the most, Russia eats the most.) It has fed generations of American immigrants.
But tracking down the Cabbage Zero that started the current cruciferous renaissance is not as easy as, say, pinning the popularity of goat cheese and beets on Wolfgang Puck in the 1980s or tipping the hat to Roy Choi for wrapping kimchi and bulgogi in a corn tortilla and driving the Korean taco craze 25 years later.
A decade or so ago, farmers who sell largely to restaurants began to grow more specialty cabbage, like the small, tender Caraflex, which is often called conehead or arrowhead because of its pointy tip, as well as napa cabbage and Tendersweets, which are shaped like flattened ovals with loosely packed thin, crisp leaves.
Chefs looking to create dishes for a new plant-forward world discovered that coneheads were easy to braise or roast, and looked gorgeous when quartered and sauced on a plate.
It's hard to know who jumped into the cabbage pool first, but some chefs make bigger splashes than others. In 2018, Thomas Keller's New York restaurant Per Se offered a charcoal-grilled Caraflex cabbage with apple, sunchokes and pumpkin seeds surrounded by red cabbage jus.
Around the same time, the Chicago chef Paul Kahan put a charred wedge of cabbage on his menu at the Publican after tasting a version with hazelnut muhammara and a drizzle of tahini that Alon Shaya served when he was the chef at Shaya in New Orleans. Mr. Shaya has been making the dish for a decade. He serves it at both Saba in New Orleans and Safta in Denver, and it will be on the menu when he opens Safta 1964 in Las Vegas next month.
By 2019, it looked as though cabbage was well on its way, at least according to The Associated Press. A few months later, Eater hailed cabbage as "your next great vegetable crush." The pandemic slowed the vegetable's momentum in restaurants, but there was a spike in sauerkraut and kimchi sales when people thought fermented cabbage might ward off Covid.
Now, cabbage fever is stronger than ever. "I think 2024 is going to be a really exciting year in cabbage," predicted the celebrity farmer Lee Jones of the Chef's Garden, a specialty farm in northern Ohio.
Since 2017, Max Morningstar of MX Morningstar Farm near Hudson, N.Y., has been steadily adding arrowhead cabbage to his brassica mix. He plants close to two acres of it, but is pondering whether he should expand to six next fall.
"Who peddled the humble arrowhead cabbage to be what it is today? I'm not really sure," he said. "Someone says this is going to be the thing, and this time around it's cabbage."
The New York chef Victoria Blamey, who grew up in Chile, hated cabbage and its sulfurous smell. But as a young cook working in England, she tasted a dish of cabbage with bacon that had been slowly coaxed into softness. Now she uses the vegetable in terrines and chou farci, and recently married Murdoc cabbage, king crab and vanilla at Blanca, which recently reopened in Brooklyn.
"Cabbage can be as classy and luxurious as anything else," she said.
But what of the home cook? For people who grew up eating Southern-fried cabbage or Chinese hand-torn cabbage or cabbage curry, cabbage isn't news. The amount of cabbage Americans eat has dropped in this century, to roughly six pounds per capita in 2022 from nine pounds in 2000.
About a third of grocery shoppers bought cabbage in 2023, down a little from 2022, according to a consumer survey by The Packer, a produce industry publication. And they weren't just cooks on a budget. People making more than $ 100,000 a year bought more cabbage than those earning under $ 25,000, the report said.
Paul Crognale, who with his wife, Hana, runs Down Home Acres, a small farm in Unadilla, N.Y., sells produce at two greenmarkets on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Restaurants used to buy his Caraflex cabbage before the pandemic. Now, most of them turn to a distributor, so he's been trying to gin up interest among home cooks.
"I thought it was super-cool and I thought it would be more popular," he said. "On the Upper West Side, it sure wasn't."

Power Plays Abound as Gangs Sow Chaos in Haiti's Capital: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The Caribbean nation has plunged into disorder and violence with gangs controlling access to the main airport and seaports, and taking command of many parts of Port-au-Prince.
Haiti, a Caribbean nation with a long history of upheaval, is enduring one of its worst periods of chaos.
Gangs have shut down the airport; looted seaports, public buildings and shops; and attacked nearly a dozen police stations. Roads are blocked, cutting off the food supply, and 4,600 inmates were freed after prisons were attacked.
The prime minister, Ariel Henry, is stranded in Puerto Rico while gang members wreak havoc, demand his resignation and hold up dozens of trucks filled with World Food Program food shipments.
A state of emergency around Port-au-Prince, the capital, was extended another month.
With the government on the verge of collapse, the United States and Caribbean nations are working to come up with a resolution -- including a plan for a transitional government -- that would restore some semblance of order to the troubled nation and allow Mr. Henry to return home.
Who are the gangs and what do they want?
Experts estimate that up to 200 gangs operate in Haiti, about 20 of them in Port-au-Prince. They range from small groups of a few dozen young men who share pistols to crews of roughly 1,500 men with weekly salaries and automatic weapons who belong to hierarchal organizations with bosses.
Two main gang federations, G-Pèp and the G-9 Family, control many of the poorest neighborhoods in the capital. The criminal groups and their allies sometimes collude, but more often clash.
The groups have been historically tied to political parties: G-9 is affiliated with the ruling Haitian Tèt Kale Party, while G-Pèp tends to support opposition parties.
G-9 and its allies have largely taken over the ports and the roads around the country's main airport. It has been nearly impossible to drive from Port-au-Prince to northern cities because gangs have seized the north-south highway.
Mr. Henry left the country last week for Kenya, where he signed an agreement paving the way for a multinational force led by the east African nation to travel to Haiti and take on the gangs.
Instead, in Mr. Henry's absence, gang leaders announced a loose alliance called "Vivre Ensemble," or "Living Together." They launched coordinated attacks on state institutions with the goal of toppling the current government and preventing the international force from deploying.
"They want to swallow up neighborhoods one by one," said Nicole M. Phillips, a human rights lawyer who specializes in Haiti. "Whatever government that allows them to do that, that's what they want."
The gangs are also hoping to set up a governing council to rule the country, and they want to help pick its members so they can exert control, said Robert Muggah, who researches Haiti for various U.N. agencies.
Who leads the gangs?
The gangs have various chiefs in different neighborhoods, but in recent days a gang leader named Jimmy Chérizier, who is known as Barbecue, has become the public face of the Living Together alliance.
A former police officer known for his ruthlessness, he has been accused of leading massacres. His gang alliance, the G-9, commands downtown Port-au-Prince and has been accused of attacking neighborhoods allied with opposition political parties, looting homes, raping women and killing people at random.
He called it an "armed revolution."
He sought to strike a more conciliatory tone this week, apologizing to people whose homes had been ransacked by gangs, including his own alliance, during the recent unrest.
"Our first step in the battle is to overthrow the government of Ariel Henry, as we have always said, then we will ensure that the country has a strong state with a strong justice system to fight against the corrupt," he said during a news conference. "We are going to make sure that we have a strong security system to allow everyone to circulate at the time they want and return when they want.
"Our goal is to see another Haiti."
Though it was unclear whether the gang leader's more measured approach was sincere or calculated, Mr. Muggah noted that it was nonetheless a new stance for Mr. Chérizier.
"We've seen Chérizier and the G-9 evolve in last couple of weeks into more political rhetoric," Mr. Muggah said. "In addition to calling for rebellion and threatening civil war if their demands aren't met, they are looking to propose solutions where they would maintain their power if, at the very least, they were absolved and given amnesty for all the crimes they have committed."
Why is Kenya planning to send police officers to Haiti?
Kenya was one of the few countries to answer Haiti's international plea for help.
Haiti has not held elections in eight years. Its president was assassinated nearly three years ago. Mr. Henry, the appointed prime minister, is widely considered an illegitimate leader.
The state has essentially lost credibility and power -- and gangs have stepped in to fill the void.
Last year, nearly 5,000 people were killed and another 2,500 people were kidnapped, according to the U.N., a level of violence that doubled from the previous year's. January was the most violent month in two years, with more than 800 people killed, according to the U.N.
In late 2022, Mr. Henry asked the international community to step up. Some nations, including the United States, expressed little interest given the grim record of past international interventions in Haiti.
The United States did agree to finance most of the deployment of 1,000 Kenyan police officers, plus more from other nations, but it has been delayed by Kenyan judicial rulings.
As Haitian gangs have grown in size and firepower, they have gained more territory and important infrastructure. They charge fees to pass certain highways and to recover hijacked trucks, and demand ransoms to release kidnapping victims.
In recent years, violent groups have begun to spread to rural areas such as Artibonite, about 60 miles north of Port-au-Prince and one of Haiti's main agricultural regions. Gangs invade farms and make it difficult -- if not impossible -- for farmers to travel and sell their goods.
Who are these gang members?
That is a complicated question to answer.
"We use the word 'gang' right now because it's convenient, everybody uses it and it's a word everybody knows, but it doesn't capture what is going on," said Romain Le Cour, who researches Haiti for the Geneva-based Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime.
Most gang members are men in their 20s who come from impoverished urban neighborhoods where opportunities are scarce. They are often aligned with elite business leaders and politicians who pay them for everything from securing cargo to amassing protesters. Political parties have used the gang members in elections to either turn out the vote -- or suppress it.
"In Haiti there is a long tradition of elites trying to create and fuel paramilitary groups that have over the past decades helped them to serve their interests and use violence to keep the monopoly on some commodity or for some political interests," said Diego Da Rin, a Haiti researcher at the International Crisis Group.
The concept of irregularly formed armed groups dates back decades in Haiti, and there have been several different types of violent actors in the country.
During Haiti's dictatorship under Francois Duvalier, paramilitary groups known as Tonton Macoutes were notorious for their violence and repression. In 1995, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide outlawed paramilitary groups and disbanded the Haitian armed forces.
Former soldiers originally with Mr. Aristide's movement later created local self-defense groups known as "baz," which often followed charismatic leaders and came to rule parts of Port-au-Prince.
Other past paramilitary groups include the far-right Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti and the chimères, which were affiliated with Mr. Aristide.
Now the line between a baz and a gang is often blurry.
People fed up with gang violence have joined a movement known as "bwa kale," which embraces vigilante justice. They have committed extrajudicial murders and generally target criminals, often with the support of the local community.
In addition, many members of a government-sanctioned environmental brigade known as B-SAP have turned against the state, bringing another group of armed people into the mix.
Can the police stop them?
The Haitian National Police force has seen about 3,000 of its 15,000 employees flee in the past two years. While the United States has poured nearly $ 200 million into the department, it is notoriously outgunned and understaffed. The department owns 47 armored cars, but in a recent visit by the U.N. investigators, less than half were operational.

Full text: The power struggle in Haiti is raising pressure on the United States to ease tensions while casting doubt on plans for a Kenyan-led security mission.
Haiti's security crisis is reaching a breaking point. An alliance of armed gangs is pressing the country's prime minister to resign, placing the United States in the middle of a power struggle gripping the country. Aiming to ease the standoff, the Biden administration is increasing pressure on Prime Minister Ariel Henry to enable a transfer of power.
The United States was not actively "calling on him or pushing for him to resign," Matthew Miller, a spokesman for the State Department, said. But, he added, "we are urging him to expedite the transition to an empowered and inclusive governance structure."
The impasse points to a major inflection point in Haiti, which has been plagued by nearly perpetual crises over the last several years, as tempers flare in the country of 11.5 million people over spreading unrest, food shortages and a lack of progress in moving toward democratic elections and restoring a sense of security.
The standoff emerged after Mr. Henry, who has been backed by the United States since becoming Haiti's de facto leader after the assassination in 2021 of President Jovenel Moïse, was unable to return to Haiti on Tuesday because of doubts over safely landing at the airport in the capital, Port-au-Prince, which has been targeted in recent days by gang assaults.
Mr. Henry, after landing instead in Puerto Rico on Tuesday, has not made any public statements about his whereabouts or plans to return to Haiti. In the meantime, as scenes of looting and disarray have many people in Port-au-Prince on edge, gang leaders have rushed to fill a power vacuum.
"If Ariel Henry doesn't resign, if the international community continues to support him, we're heading straight for a civil war," Jimmy Chérizier, a top gang leader and former police officer known more widely as Barbecue, told reporters in Port-au-Prince on Tuesday.
Mr. Chérizier and other gang leaders have gone on a rampage around Port-au-Prince over the past week, clashing with the police and attacking the airport, bank offices, government buildings and prisons, including the country's largest penitentiary, allowing thousands of inmates to escape.
While different gangs appear to be behind the latest wave of unrest, security experts warn that any alliances between the gangs tend to be fluid and subject to change. It is not clear whether gang leaders are pressing to have a specific role in governing the country.
Gunfire could be heard around different parts of Port-au-Prince early Wednesday morning despite a curfew aimed at keeping people off the streets outside normal business hours. At least one court building was partially burned on Wednesday, and the airport remained closed.
The deteriorating security situation is limiting the choices available to the United States, which has traditionally held immense sway in Haiti's politics. The Biden administration has made it clear that there are no plans to deploy U.S. soldiers to Haiti to assert order.
"What we've asked the Haitian prime minister to do is move forward on a political process that will lead to the establishment of a presidential transitional council that will lead to elections," Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters on Wednesday. "And we think that is urgent -- that it's urgent that he moves forward in that direction and start the process of bringing normalcy back to the people of Haiti."
While members of Haiti's opposition have criticized the Biden administration for continuing to back Mr. Henry, U.S. officials and analysts have said the prime minister is the only leader with some legitimacy.
"Henry is there to get us through an election," said Keith Mines, vice president of the Latin America program at the U.S. Institute of Peace. "He's in the position for a reason, not because he's particularly popular, but because he has a thread of constitutionality that no one else has."
A U.S. government official said that Caricom, a union of 15 Caribbean countries, has been at the forefront of calls demanding the Haitian prime minister resign immediately.
Speaking on background to discuss sensitive issues, the official added that the United States had no other Haitian partner who would serve as an alternative to Mr. Henry and said that to demand the prime minister resign immediately would just create more chaos in a country already on the brink of collapse.
"Now they are stuck with something even more unpalatable, with no way out, no alternative to the crisis," said Robert Fatton, an expert on Haiti at the University of Virginia, referring to the Biden administration's options regarding Haiti. "The gangs have overwhelming superiority now."
The violence unleashed by gangs is making an already acute humanitarian crisis in Haiti worse. About 15,000 people were forced to leave their homes over the past few days because of escalating violence, including many who had already been displaced, said Martin Griffiths, the United Nations emergency relief coordinator. Roughly 313,000 people in Haiti are currently displaced, the U.N. has said.
Widespread hunger is another pressing concern, with about 1.4 million people in the country currently facing emergency levels of hunger, according to the World Food Program.
Overall, "nearly half the population needs humanitarian aid," said Mr. Griffiths, who is also the U.N.'s Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs. "The crisis in Haiti is deteriorating at alarming speed."
Another wild card in the crisis is Guy Philippe, a former police commander who rose to prominence internationally when he helped lead a 2004 coup that toppled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. While Mr. Philippe enjoyed herolike support in parts of Haiti, he was arrested and taken into U.S. custody in 2017.
He was sentenced to nine years in prison for money laundering. After serving part of his sentence, the United States released and deported Mr. Philippe to Haiti in November, a move experts likened to pouring gasoline on a bonfire.
Mr. Philippe quickly went to work traveling the country trying to shore up support for what he called a "revolution." He allied himself with a rogue environmental group called the Brigade for the Security of Protected Areas (or B-SAP) and criticized Mr. Henry, whom he accused of taking part in Mr. Moïse's assassination and conspiring with gangs.
On Wednesday, Mr. Philippe told The New York Times that he was eager to help Haiti establish security and the rule of law. "I am ready to be part of any board or team that truly wants to work for the well-being of the Haitian people," he said.
The deepening sense of chaos in Haiti is also raising doubts about a plan for Kenya to lead a security mission to Haiti, which the Biden administration has been pushing for over the past year. Mr. Henry had flown to Nairobi last week and on Friday signed the deal with Kenyan authorities.
Under the plan, Kenya would provide at least 1,000 police officers for the mission, which the United States had pledged to support with $ 200 million and Canada with nearly $ 60 million. Other countries, including Benin, Chad, Bangladesh and the Barbados, have also pledged to send personnel as part of the mission.
"That agreement was signed by someone with no legitimacy," said Monique Clesca, a Haitian democracy activist and former United Nations official, emphasizing that Haiti's parliament, which is currently not functioning, and possibly its future leader would need to approve the agreement for the mission to move forward.
Still, others in Haiti contend the Kenyan plan is still on the table. "It's a fait accompli," said Claude Joseph, a former prime minister and a leader of one of the political parties in discussions aimed at replacing Mr. Henry. "We need to move forward with the plan. We need it, as soon as possible. We need a strong police with international support."

South Plants Next Target For U.A.W.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A looming union election at a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga could determine the trajectory of union organizing at more than a dozen auto factories.
When Shawn Fain, the United Automobile Workers president, unveiled the deal that ended six weeks of strikes at Ford Motor in the fall, he framed it as part of a longer campaign. Next, he declared, would be the task of organizing nonunion plants across the country.
"One of our biggest goals coming out of this historic contract victory is to organize like we've never organized before," he said at the time. "When we return to the bargaining table in 2028, it won't just be with the Big Three. It will be the Big Five or Big Six."
Four months later, the first test of that strategy has come into focus, and it features a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tenn.
According to the union, more than half of over 4,000 eligible workers have signed cards indicating support for a union. Workers say they have done so because they want higher pay, more paid time off and more generous health benefits -- and because the recent strikes at Ford, General Motors and Stellantis persuaded them that a union can help win these concessions.
"The Big Three, they had their big campaign, and their big strike and vote, and new contracts -- we paid attention to that very closely," said Yolanda Peoples, who has worked at the Volkswagen plant for nearly 13 years.
The Volkswagen plant announced an 11 percent pay increase shortly after the strikes at the Big Three. The raise brought the top hourly wage for production workers to $ 32.40, but the comparable wage for the Detroit automakers will exceed $ 40 by the end of the new contracts. (Volkswagen said the wage adjustment was part of a yearly review.)
Unions need a simple majority of votes to win, but the U.A.W. says it won't file for an election at the Chattanooga plant until 70 percent of the plant's workers have signed cards and workers have built an extensive organizing committee, which union officials expect in the next month.
The caution reflects the U.A.W.'s experience in the South, where past campaigns fell short.
But the stakes may be even higher this time given the union's investment in organizing several plants at once -- including a Mercedes-Benz factory in Alabama, where more than 50 percent of workers have signed cards, and a Hyundai plant in Alabama, where the union has cards from more than 30 percent of workers.
Last week, the union said it was also allocating $ 40 million to organizing auto and battery workers through 2026 -- far exceeding its previous budget for such efforts, according to Jonah Furman, a union spokesman -- and suggested that time was of the essence.
"In the next few years, the electric vehicle battery industry is slated to add tens of thousands of jobs across the country, and new standards are being set as the industry comes online," the union said in its funding announcement.
If the union wins in Chattanooga, said Joshua Murray, a sociologist at Vanderbilt University who has studied the auto industry's response to unionization, it may quickly replicate the victory at other plants, as it did during an organizing wave in the 1930s.
"A lot of time the failure to unionize is not that workers are against being in a union -- it's that they're not convinced they can win," Dr. Murray said. "Showing they can win is a big deal for getting workers who weren't gung-ho about it to be gung-ho."
A loss in Chattanooga, Dr. Murray said, could sap employees' confidence and encourage management at other automakers to resist.
Other analysts, like Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at the research firm AutoForecast Solutions, predicted that Tesla would be a particular challenge. "The head of Tesla is Elon Musk, and he's going to fight against change," Mr. Fiorani said.
The union appears to be benefiting from a resurgence of interest in organizing after a lull during the presidency of Donald J. Trump and the start of the pandemic. Last year, unions won more than 1,225 elections -- the most in at least a decade, according to the National Labor Relations Board. They lost about 500.
Polling shows that younger workers are especially supportive, and they appear to be helping to fuel the recent auto industry organizing. "We're letting them know, 'You're making a nice pay rate compared to your age, but this can be better,"' said Ronald Terry, a worker involved in the organizing at the Hyundai plant in Alabama.
Younger workers at the Volkswagen plant also express frustration at the paid time off they accrue: 12 or 13 days during their first two years of employment, several of which they must use during plant shutdowns if they want to be paid.
Asked about the complaints, a Volkswagen spokesman said that the company understood that time off was a significant issue and that it had recently announced an increase in unpaid time off for emergencies.
The company said last month that its Chattanooga wages had increased at nearly twice the rate of inflation since 2013, and that the average production worker would make more than $ 60,000 this year before bonuses or overtime and pay less than $ 2,000 in premiums to cover more than 80 percent of health care costs.
The union sought a vote in Chattanooga in 2014 and faced no opposition from the company, whose worldwide plants are mostly unionized. But the effort failed amid pressure from state Republican leaders, who suggested that a union would jeopardize the plant's expansion.
With workers complaining of understaffing, high injury rates and last-minute overtime, the U.A.W. tried again in 2019. But pleas from Tennessee's governor and the plant's original chief executive, who said he had returned to his former position to address workers' concerns, appeared to defuse support. The union narrowly lost.
This time, the union appears determined to minimize the effect of such pushback.
The union wants to recruit a volunteer leader for every line on every shift at the plant -- more than 125 altogether, according to the union's tally. That way, organizers say, the volunteers can quickly respond to rumors or company talking points that co-workers encounter.
"If you don't have someone continuing that conversation, we have seen some of that backsliding in a few smaller areas," said Isaac Meadows, a worker involved in the organizing.
He attributed the backsliding to the influence of outside groups and chatter from workers' friends and relatives that a union would discourage employers from locating in Tennessee.
Gerald McCormick, a Republican who as the state's House majority leader opposed the union during the 2014 vote, said Republicans might worry that the union would support left-wing causes in Tennessee if it got a foothold there.
"They don't want to do them any favors," he said, referring to the state's Republican leadership, which he predicted would oppose the union campaign again.
As in 2019, the employer's response may be crucial. The Volkswagen brand appears to be roughly holding its own in the United States, and somewhat ahead in the transition to electric vehicles.
More than 11 percent of Volkswagen's U.S. sales last year came from E.V.s -- specifically the ID.4, a compact sport utility vehicle built in Chattanooga. That figure was higher than the overall 9.4 percent share for plug-in vehicles in the U.S. market, according to BloombergNEF, an energy research firm.
A Volkswagen official said during a tour of the plant that about one-third of its output this year would probably be ID.4s, and that the share could double within a decade.
If that happens, the plant may be relatively well positioned to absorb higher labor costs. Corey Cantor, an electric vehicle analyst at BloombergNEF, said continued battery innovation, along with efficiencies from larger-scale battery production, could offset the cost increases associated with unionization.
But a union presence could complicate the ramp-up in electric vehicle production, Mr. Fiorani of AutoForecast Solutions said, if the union resists the decline in workers per car that may accompany the shift. He noted that companies that made their own batteries might be able to reallocate those workers rather than lay them off, however.
Pablo Di Si, the chief executive of Volkswagen Group of America, said in a statement that the plant had already added jobs in battery pack assembly and battery engineering.
Meeting with reporters last month, a Volkswagen official said that the company would stay neutral during an election campaign, but that "neutral doesn't mean silent -- it means impartial to what employees decide."
The official added that the company would correct misinformation, which it accuses the union of spreading, about pay and working conditions in the plant. (Companies reaching neutrality agreements with unions typically do not intervene this way.)
Mr. Meadows, the union supporter, said managers had communicated skepticism in sometimes subtle ways, like removing union fliers from lunch tables.
"Somebody put out a couple of business cards for a lawn service company, and we had some material on the same table," Mr. Meadows recalled. "Our materials disappeared, and the others did not."
Volkswagen said the cleanliness of the tables was governed by "clear policies."

Not Shakespeare's Finest, But Making the Best of It: [Review]

Full text: If Fiasco Theater has mixed results in its production of this Shakespearean tragicomedy, it celebrates actors supporting and delighting in one another's work.
"Pericles" is a bit of a mess. Spanning decades and traversing the ancient Mediterranean like some deeply misbegotten Carnival Cruise, this Shakespeare play mingles comedy, tragedy and Christian allegory. There are two assassination plots, two shipwrecks, a brothel, a riddle, a tournament and some very convenient pirates. Deliberately anachronistic, it was described by Ben Jonson, a rival playwright, as a "mouldy tale" and "stale."
So, who better to face down this confusion than a company called Fiasco? A devised theater ensemble founded by half a dozen Brown MFA graduates, Fiasco has a soft spot for Shakespeare's less loved works. The company broke out in 2011 with a production of "Cymbeline" and later staged "The Two Gentlemen of Verona." (Fiasco's 2017 production of a crowd-pleaser like "Twelfth Night"? An outlier.)
Rather than relying on the published text of "Pericles," Fiasco has set much of the poetry to music -- sometimes supplying original words -- and interpolated passages from a prose version by George Wilkins, a pamphleteer and publican. (Wilkins is often cited as the play's co-author, mostly because scholars disbelieve that Shakespeare could have written anything as patchy as the first two acts.)
Ben Steinfeld, a company member and the director, stages this revised text at Classic Stage Company using Fiasco's poor-theater playbook -- a mostly bare stage furnished with charisma, invention, spirit and song. "A miracle may come your way," an early number promises.
Through the hectic first half, this approach falters. Pericles (Paco Tolson at first, then Tatiana Wechsler, Noah Brody and finally Devin E. Haqq) goes to so many places in such a short time that characters and climes blur, especially without the help of scenery to differentiate each country. As Steinfeld's narrator admits, "Now this is just an empty space/It's hard to give a sense of place." (No set designer is credited, though Ashley Rose Horton designed the vaguely Grecian costumes and Mextly Couzin the golden lighting.)
The stagecraft can feel scanty -- a satin sheet stands in for a shipwreck -- although the extra-textual moments, like the jousting tournament, are staged with the most vigor. And while the idea of having four actors play Pericles in turn is wise to the ways that a human might change over a lifetime, it saps interest in and identification with the character.
Midway through, "Pericles" finds its sea legs, mostly because the action shifts to Pericles's daughter, Marina, played by the luminous Emily Young. This also signals the play's move away from struggle and loss and toward redemption and joy, more natural keys for Fiasco, which has always excelled at comedy. The brothel scenes, in which a chaste Marina reforms would-be customers, are sprightly. And the ending, among Shakespeare's best, is suitably moving. But the chief delight here, as in any Fiasco show, is watching the actors work with such fluency and in such communion, supporting and enjoying one another's work. That's not quite a miracle, but it's reason enough to set sail.

Tipped Lander Will Die Soon As Long Night Saps Batteries: [National Desk]

Full text: The privately built American spacecraft's ability to send home images and other data has been limited by its sideways landing. On another part of the moon, a Japanese spacecraft woke up.
Odysseus, the American robotic spacecraft that landed on the moon last week, is likely to die in the next day or so.
Communications with the toppled lander remain limited and will end when sunlight is no longer shining on the solar panels, Intuitive Machines, the Houston-based company that built and operates Odysseus, said on Monday morning.
The company also released images that the spacecraft took as it descended, but none yet from the surface.
Odysseus is the first American spacecraft to land on the moon since Apollo 17 in 1972, and the first private one ever to successfully set down there in one piece. However, during the landing on Thursday evening, the lander, about 14 feet tall, appears to have been traveling faster than planned and ended up tipped over on its side.
As a result, its antennas are not pointed back at Earth, greatly slowing the rate that data can be sent back. While some of the solar panels of Odysseus were initially bathed in sunlight, they will soon be in shadow as the sun moves across the sky. That will starve the spacecraft of energy, and its batteries will drain.
Odysseus is not designed to survive the two weeks of lunar night that will follow, with temperatures dropping below minus-200 degrees Fahrenheit.
"Flight controllers intend to collect data until the lander's solar panels are no longer exposed to light," Intuitive Machines posted on X. "Based on Earth and Moon positioning, we believe flight controllers will continue to communicate with Odysseus until Tuesday morning."
Flight controllers also now know exactly where Odysseus sits on the moon. On Saturday, NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter took a picture as it passed over the landing site, revealing a speck that was not there in an earlier image that the orbiter had taken of the area.
Odysseus landed within about a mile of its target landing site -- with higher precision than most earlier landers. That feat was even more impressive given that engineers at Intuitive Machines had to patch the spacecraft's software to bypass nonfunctioning lasers that were supposed to track the spacecraft's altitude.
Intuitive Machines said that Odysseus was also able to detect nine safe landing sites within the south pole region, information that could prove useful for future missions as NASA and other space agencies look to explore that region. Frozen water in the shadows of craters there could one day provide crucial resources for astronauts.
As Odysseus fades, another lunar lander unexpectedly popped back to life. JAXA, the Japanese space agency, reported on Monday that its Smart Lander for Investigating Moon, or SLIM, had revived. SLIM successfully landed on the moon in January. The failure of one of its two engines caused it to move sideways at landing, and, like Odysseus, tipped over into an unexpected orientation with its solar panels in shadow.
SLIM did come to life a few days later when sunlight hit some of the panels, but it went back to sleep as lunar night descended.
Like Odysseus, SLIM was not designed for the frigid cold.
But with the sun back in the sky, SLIM's solar panels generated enough energy to charge its batteries and get back in touch with Earth. The temperatures were so high that communications were ended soon after, JAXA said.
However, JAXA said it planned to resume SLIM's scientific studies of the surrounding terrain once temperatures fall.
While no one is counting on it to do so, Odysseus too might wake again after the sun rises at its landing site in March.

Full text: In her novels and story collections, she took a sharp, lightly ironic look at the class from which she came, the Southern upper bourgeoisie.
Ellen Gilchrist, a Southern writer with a sharp, sometimes indulgent eye for her region's foibles and eccentricities, died on Jan. 30 at her home in Ocean Springs, Miss. She was 88.
Her son Pierre Gautier Walker III confirmed the death. He said Ms. Gilchrist had breast cancer.
Ms. Gilchrist, who published some 26 books -- novels, collections of short stories, poetry and memoirs -- was known for her sharp, lightly ironic dissections of the class from which she came, the Southern upper bourgeoisie. She had spent part of her childhood on a family plantation in the Mississippi Delta -- she was born in the principal city at its edge, Vicksburg -- and her fiction was populated by the gentry that came from that land, in both its urban and rural incarnations.
She won the National Book Award in 1984 for her story collection "Victory Over Japan." But it was her first collection, "In the Land of Dreamy Dreams" (1981), which depicted in large part the fissures and pathologies of the New Orleans upper class, that was in some ways most characteristic. She considered it her best work.
She had already lived in New Orleans for 13 years when that book was published and had "been visiting there all my life," she said in an interview at the University of Arkansas in 2010. She knew the city's upper social strata intimately, and she rendered it with a precision that still rings true more than 40 years later.
Many of the character types that populated her later fiction were already present in that first collection: unhappy affluent couples living in big houses, housewives who played tennis and drank too much, rebellious overindulged children and teenagers, and, at the edges, a shadowy world of lightly described Black people in subordinate roles. Mr. Walker, her son, described the book in a phone interview as "more of a series of factual essays with the names changed."
Ms. Gilchrist was a disciple of the Southern writer Eudora Welty, with whom she studied at Millsaps College in Jackson, Miss., in the 1960s, and she followed Ms. Welty in producing sharply etched dialogue that revealed subtle class distinctions.
"In the Land of Dreamy Dreams" was first published by the fledgling University of Arkansas Press, and it was an unexpected hit for a university press. "It was this huge success and sold all the copies in about a week, and then he kept printin' 'em," Ms. Gilchrist said in her interview at the university, where she taught English and creative writing for some 25 years.
The book sold more than 10,000 copies in its first 10 months; was republished by what became her principal publisher, Little, Brown & Company; and earned critical acclaim. The novelist Jim Crace called it "a sustained display of delicately and rhythmically modulated prose and an unsentimental dissection of raw sentiment" in The Times Literary Supplement in 1982. (A later reviewer in the same publication, Wendy Steiner, was less kind: In 1989 she put Ms. Gilchrist in "the sociological category of Southern American Princess, or SAP.")
"In the Land of Dreamy Dreams" launched Ms. Gilchrist as a writer when she was 46 and had endured a complicated personal life that included, as she wrote in the essay collection "The Writing Life" (2005), "four marriages, three caesarean sections, an abortion, 24 years of psychotherapy and lots of lovely men," as well as a struggle with alcoholism.
She considered the late start no accident. "To tell the truth I was 40 years old before I had enough experience of life to be a writer," she wrote in "The Writing Life," adding, "I barely knew what I thought, much less what anything meant."
The stream of story collections and novels that followed her first success often traced the fates of Southern women like Rhoda, who first appeared in "In the Land of Dreamy Dreams" and took center stage in "Victory Over Japan" -- a headstrong, egotistical and cantankerous young woman, and not altogether lovable.
Not all reviewers were charmed. Of Rhoda in a later manifestation, Katherine Dieckmann wrote in The New York Times in 2000, "The giddy shenanigans of a cracked, privileged Southern belle grow a bit wearying."
Ms. Gilchrist's "strongest characters," Mr. Walker said, "are women trying to break out of the framework of the 1950s and 1960s."
Some of them are crushed by it. Lelia, who lives in a big house ("wide central hall" and "staircase five feet wide") by Audubon Park in New Orleans, is exasperated by her husband, Will, and by his complaints about their drug-taking son Robert, in the short story "The President of the Louisiana Live Oak Society" in "In the Land of Dreamy Dreams":
"'He's driving me crazy,' she said, settling into the shampoo chair. 'Between the two of them I don't care if I live or die. I can't even play tennis worth a damn. I lost every important match I played last week. I'm down to six on the ladder."'
The tiny details give away the social setting: the shampoo chair at the beauty parlor, the ladder, the painfully idle wife's preoccupation with tennis. The "President" of the story's title is an insouciant young Black drug dealer who comes to a bad end.
The story reveals both Ms. Gilchrist's sharp eye and her partial complicity in this heedless world -- for which some reviewers, particularly those outside the South, took her to task.
Reviewing her collection "Drunk With Love" in The New York Times in 1986, Wendy Lesser, the editor of The Threepenny Review, complained that while her stories seemed at first like "a wild, well-populated, vastly amusing party," one eventually sees that "there is only a small number of people at the party after all: a weary, neurotic Southern wife; her overworked, insensitive Jewish husband; a cynical female artist or two (one of them a red-haired writer); some faithful Black servants; an irresponsible, charming lover; and few others."
Ms. Gilchrist was aware of her limitations. She recalled greeting the civil rights movement in Jackson in the 1960s, when she was involved in local theater, tremulously: "We invited Black people to the performances. Jane" -- Jane Reid Petty, founder and director of the New Stage Theater in Jackson -- "had dinner for visiting Black professors at Tougaloo College. I was dazzled and scared."
Ellen Louise Gilchrist was born in Vicksburg, Miss., on Feb. 20, 1935, the daughter of William Garth Gilchrist Jr., an engineer who helped build levees for the Army Corps of Engineers, and Aurora Alford Gilchrist. Her father had been a minor-league baseball player, and her paternal great-grandfather had been a governor of Mississippi.
Her father traveled for his career, and Ms. Gilchrist attended schools in the South and Midwest. She studied English at Vanderbilt University and earned a B.A. in philosophy from Millsaps College in 1967 and later an M.F.A. in English from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, where she lived for almost 35 years.
She said she fell into the writing life almost by accident, though she had always written, mostly poetry. "I was busy falling in love and getting married to three different men (I married the father of my children twice) and having babies and buying clothes and getting my hair fixed and running in the park and playing tennis," she wrote in "The Writing Life."
In addition to her son Pierre, Ms. Gilchrist is survived by two other sons, Marshall Peteet Walker Jr. and Garth Gilchrist Walker; 18 grandchildren; 10 great-grandchildren; and her brother, Robert Alford Gilchrist.
When she became, by her account, a minor celebrity in the mid-1980s, interviewed by Newsweek and People, NPR invited her to do weekly commentaries. But then "NPR began to change and they got all these young Ivy League girls in there," she said with characteristic asperity in the 2010 interview. "Politically correct to the ninth power." And that was that.
The new feminism was not to her liking, especially as she considered that she had been practicing a version of it all along. "It never occurred to me that bein' a woman or bein' a girl limited me in any way," she said in 2010. "It never entered my mind."
Her characters reflect that fierce embrace of life. "The miracle of life and walking around, these things mattered to her," Pierre Walker said. "Pay attention to the beauty and wonder of life all around you. Don't get caught up in the details that weigh you down."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In the cocktail world, Singapore almost inevitably evokes the pink, gin-based, grenadine-spiked Singapore Sling, a drink born in 1915 at the stylish Long Bar at the Raffles Hotel. In those strait-laced colonial days, it was improper for women to imbibe in public, so a bartender formulated a cocktail that looked like fruit juice. Today, the creative minds at idiosyncratic bars across the city are putting the same spirit of ingenuity to work, driven by eco-consciousness and the island's diverse heritage, and highlighting some unexpected ingredients. Here are six standout spots.
Atlas
"The fun thing about gin is that the possibilities are endless," said Atlas's head bartender, Lidiyanah K, ticking off some of the many directions I could take: "Floral, citrus, spicy, herbaceous." Gin, while defined by the flavor of juniper, is hardly homogeneous. And if ever there was a place to learn about the diversity of gins produced with local botanicals, Atlas is it. Yes, it's in the lobby of Parkview Square, a grand Art Deco-style office building that houses several embassies, but calling it a lobby bar feels a bit like calling the Beatles a rock 'n' roll band or Georges Seurat a landscape painter. Think of it as a gin museum: It offers more than 1,300 varieties of the spirit, many displayed in a soaring, 26-foot gilt tower. The collection includes a veritable archive of historic bottles, pulled from one of the tower's high shelves when someone orders a selection from the "vintage martini" section. You can choose your own gin from any decade of the 20th century (60 to 275 Singapore dollars, or about $ 45 to $ 205).
The Gilded Age-inspired space also features a room with an epic Champagne collection. Renovated in 2017 as a paean to early-20th-century Manhattan, it has tufted-leather furniture, vaulted ceilings with Art Nouveau-style paintings, and grand Cleopatra- and King Tut-themed murals.
Fura
"Why are we even eating caviar? Why can't we just leave sturgeon alone?" asked Sasha Wijidessa as she spooned a dollop of vegan black-garlic caviar onto a block of kombu ice cream floating in a vodka mix in a martini glass. She instructed me to let the ice cream melt so it formed a cap. Its umami essence permeated the drink.
Over the course of the night, she also prepared a Jellyfish Martini (gin infused with jellyfish; distillate of fish leaf, a peppery local plant; spirulina-infused dry vermouth; and oil infused with roasted kelp: 25 dollars) and the So You Bought Sad Corn (25 dollars), a Scotch-based drink sweetened with corn-vinegar caramel.
Fura, a narrow, minimalist bar on the second floor of a colonial-style shophouse, is owned and run by Miss Wijidessa and her partner in business and life, Christina Rasmussen, the former head forager at Noma. The drinks and dishes they offer (they call it future food) border on the surreal, and their mission is to provide a glimpse of how consumption might look if it focused on creating balance in the ecosystem. As such, they make clever use of sustainable crops like tonka beans and overabundant species like jellyfish. Yes, the owners will be happy to tell you all about lacto-fermentation and the vegan custards and meringue used in their fanciful recipes if you ask, but they are also resolute in their promise that this is a bar, not a lecture hall.
Analogue Initiative
The setting of Analogue Initiative at Chijmes, an eggshell white former 19th-century convent and girls' school, belies the futuristic mind-set of the bar, where everything is plant-based, even some of the furniture. (The tables are made of mycelium, the threadlike tissue of mushrooms, bound with wood chips and molded into shape.) The colossal, wraparound undulating aquamarine bar evokes ocean waves. It was 3-D printed using more than 3,500 pounds of recycled plastic.
The earth's ecological future inspired Vijay Mudaliar, a co-owner, to create a menu that tries to answer a question similar to the one posed at Fura: What if overfarming and climate change wiped out certain crops and foods? To that end, most drinks involve an analogue (wink, wink) of a familiar ingredient. Aside from local yuzu, for instance, kombuchas, vinegars and distillates stand in for fresh citrus. The Faux Espresso (26 dollars) relied on toasted chicory, toasted barley and carob. (Coffee is among the most overfarmed crops, Mr. Mudaliar said.) Coconut nectar, not sugar, provided the sweetness (sugar cane is also overfarmed), and whisked aquafaba, the liquid from a can of chickpeas, took the place of dairy foam. And one giddy absurdist drama of a cocktail (26 dollars) whose name contains an expletive poking fun at the fine-dining world's obsession with luxury, vaguely resembled a Bellini -- a mixture of peach-infused gin, grape juice fermented with Champagne yeast, and a species of seaweed that's musky and vaguely truffle-tasting, crowned with "caviar" made of seaweed pearls. It was as delicious as it was silly.
Jungle Ballroom
On a fittingly steamy evening, Adrian Besa, the bar manager at Jungle Ballroom, was telling me about his recent visit to a remote Cambodian distillery that makes gin using the herbs and botanicals grown on an electricity-free biodynamic farm. He grabbed a bottle off a high shelf and offered me a whiff; it smelled fresh and vegetal -- only vaguely piney. Cambodia is just one Southeast Asian country whose flavors take center stage at Jungle Ballroom, a glitzy spot that assumes a D.J.-driven, clubby vibe later in the night. Mr. Besa also poured me tastes of musky-sweet coconut wine from the Philippines; fragrant, tangy Sri Lankan arrack, distilled from coconut sap; craft gins from China, Thailand, the Philippines and Singapore; and fruity, butter-pastry-scented pineapple-tart Soju from the local distillery Compendium Spirits.
Mr. Besa has devised a menu that represents different layers of a jungle: Canopy, which features bright, fruity, zingy drinks and various nut ingredients; Understorey, which encompasses various fizzes and spiced or tangy cocktails, like my favorite, the Shrub (26 dollars), a zesty mix of Indian gin steeped with fresh and slightly nutty pandan leaves, vermouth, and a housemade, vinegary pear shrub; and Forest Floor, where drinks with rich fruit and dense, piquant herbal flavors and fragrances reign. It was a multisensory free fall, and I didn't want it to end.
The Elephant Room
When Yugnes Susela was growing up in Singapore, his family would have chicken curry for dinner almost every Sunday -- sometimes accompanied by a nip of whisky. It wasn't too much of a stretch, then, for Mr. Susela, a founder of the Elephant Room, to combine whisky and curry in a glass. The Chicken Curry (27 dollars), the bar's savory riff on an old-fashioned, topped with a strip of fried chicken skin, might sound bizarre -- satirical, even -- but to Mr. Susela, it made perfect sense.
"If the end product looks good, tastes great and smells great, it's a cocktail," he said as he took a bottle of fenugreek-infused tequila out of an apothecary-style cabinet displaying jars and bottles containing herbs, spices or twigs steeping in liquids. He poured a few drops of the tequila, and the almondy, earthy, ever-so-slightly-maple aromas rang out with the clarity of a crystal bell. It was the signature ingredient in the Goan Rabbit (25 dollars), a subcontinental variation on the margarita. Indian spices also played starring roles in Ramu's Fizz (25 dollars), a twist on the classic Ramos gin fizz, a citrusy drink with a meringue-like texture that comes from egg whites, cream and a great deal of shaking. In Mr. Susela's version, it was jazzed up with cumin-infused gin, ginger syrup and spiced cream. And the house mangosteen-strawberry cordial provided the Wild and Fresh (27 dollars), a spin on the familiar Negroni, with a salty-sour dimension.
Sago House
The neon sign behind the bar at Sago House reads, "Don't try," but that's not to suggest you give up and drink your life away. It's the epitaph of the writer Charles Bukowski (as the bar manager, Naz Zurimi, explained, it's a command to be true to yourself -- no pretense allowed). No surprise, then, that the bar's easygoing vibe feels like hanging out at a longtime friend's apartment -- and not just because staff members write your name in chalk on the bar or tabletop when you arrive, as if they were saving you your regular seat.
In October, Sago House relocated to a roomy street-level location, a drastic change from the compact, third-story space where it debuted in 2020. But it lost none of its cozy charm. The three owners, local industry veterans, applied their original D.I.Y. approach to the new space, which features shelves made of wine crates and sewing machine tables used as furniture. The six-drink menu (starting at 24 dollars), which is posted on the bar's Instagram account, changes weekly, but always offers different versions of the same classic cocktail styles: an old-fashioned, a highball, a sour, a tropical cocktail, a daisy, and a martini or a Manhattan.

Retreat on Immigration Bill Reflects Fading Hopes for a Compromise: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Republicans demanded a border crackdown but have rejected a bipartisan plan to impose one, underscoring the intractable politics of the issue in an election year.
Republicans in Congress who have spent months demanding that any aid to Ukraine be paired with a crackdown against migration into the United States got what they asked for when a bipartisan group of senators released a $ 118.3 billion agreement that would provide both.
On Monday, many of them rejected it anyway.
It was the latest indication that the political ground for any agreement on immigration -- particularly in an election year when it is expected to be a central issue of the presidential campaign -- has vanished.
With former President Donald J. Trump eager to attack President Biden's record on the border and right-wing Republicans in Congress falling in line behind him, a compromise was always going to be a long shot. The long-awaited release on Sunday night of the text of the 370-page bill only served to inflame Republican divisions on an issue that once united them.
Even as Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader and a champion of funding for Ukraine, took to the floor to push for action on the bill, many of his fellow Republican leaders were savaging it. Speaker Mike Johnson denounced the measure as "even worse than we expected" and, in a joint statement with his leadership team, repeated what had become his mantra about the deal -- that it would be "dead on arrival" in the House.
Even more temperate Republican voices like Senator John Cornyn of Texas, who had encouraged the negotiations, said that after reviewing it, he harbored "serious concerns." (Mr. Cornyn, who is often mentioned as a potential successor to Mr. McConnell as the Republican leader, notably gave the statement to the hard-right news outlet Breitbart.)
By Monday evening, Mr. McConnell was privately acknowledging that the measure had hemorrhaged support among Republicans, and recommending they move to block it unless Democrats agreed to debate it further and allow them to propose changes.
It pointed to a bleak outlook for the complicated compromise bill that followed a longstanding pattern on Capitol Hill, where major immigration agreements have often come close to enactment only to fall apart just before the finish line after Republicans condemn them as too weak.
The first test for the measure will come on Wednesday, when an initial procedural vote is planned. It needs 60 votes to advance, meaning at least 10 Republicans would have to back it. Even if the bill could scale that hurdle and pass the Senate, there appears to be no path forward in the House.
"The $ 64,000 question now is whether or not senators can drown out the outside noise, drown out people like Donald Trump who want chaos and do the right thing for America," Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, said in a speech on the Senate floor on Monday afternoon. "I urge senators of good will on both sides of the aisle to do the right thing and tune the chaos out."
Mr. Schumer reminded his colleagues that "we live in an era of divided government, and that means that both sides need to compromise if we want to pass a bill."
Yet the Republicans' retreat from the deal also threatened to sap support on the left, where some Democrats are reluctant to support a bill that pro-immigration groups have denounced as a betrayal of American values and that some conservative groups like the National Border Patrol Council were endorsing.
For Democrats who have pressed for any immigration measure to include legal status for large groups of undocumented people, including the so-called Dreamers brought to the United States as children, a vote for a bill that contains no such provisions and has no path to becoming law anyway is a bitter pill.
Among Republicans, there is even less enthusiasm for finding any middle ground at the start of an election year in which Mr. Trump is already winning nominating contests. He has once again made the border a central plank of his campaign and encouraged Republicans to oppose anything short of the hard-line policies he instituted as president. And his "America First" approach to foreign policy has also helped to sap G.O.P. support for sending aid to Ukraine for its war against Russian aggression.
Senator Steve Daines, Republican of Montana and the chairman of the Senate Republicans' campaign arm, reiterated Mr. Trump's talking points on Monday in saying bluntly that he would be a "no" vote on the bill.
"I can't support a bill that doesn't secure the border, provides taxpayer funded lawyers to illegal immigrants and gives billions to radical open borders groups," he said on social media.
By Monday morning, at least 15 Senate Republicans and three Senate Democrats had made it clear they would oppose the bill, raising questions about whether Mr. Schumer and Mr. McConnell would be able to deliver the 60 votes necessary for passage.
"Make no mistake, a gauntlet has been thrown and America needs to pick it up," Mr. McConnell said on Monday afternoon of sending critical funding to Ukraine.
In an unusual turn that underscored the Republican divide, a Senate G.O.P. leadership aide who insisted on anonymity circulated a point-by-point rebuttal on Monday evening to House Republican leaders' statement criticizing the bill.
But later, in a private meeting with Republicans, Mr. McConnell recommended that they vote no on Wednesday in a bid to force Democrats to allow them to propose changes to the bill, according to people familiar with his comments who described them on the condition of anonymity. And he did nothing to try to persuade his colleagues not to oppose the measure, bowing to an increasingly evident reality.
In public, Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Republican who had joined Mr. McConnell in pressing for the bipartisan deal, was noncommittal, suggesting that members of his party might be reluctant to support a measure being criticized as too weak if it could not become law.
"People want a result," he told reporters. "They want an outcome if we're going to go through this process."
Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma, who served as the lead Republican negotiator on the border deal, could not mask his frustration with his own party as he sought to explain the final product that was released after more than three months of daily negotiations. The same Republicans who complained that they needed more time to read through the bill, Mr. Lankford vented, were rushing to denounce it on social media.
"Are we, as Republicans, going to have press conferences and complain the border is bad and then intentionally leave it open after the worst month in American history in December?" he said on "Fox & Friends."
The answer was shaping up to be a clear yes. And by late Monday night, even he was refusing to say whether he would vote to allow his package to advance.
Some progressive senators also said the deal missed the mark.
Senator Alex Padilla of California, who is Hispanic, condemned the bill for failing to provide relief for Dreamers and making it more difficult for migrants to be granted asylum. He lamented that not a single member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus was included in the negotiations.
"While bipartisanship requires political compromise, it does not require compromising our nation's core values," said Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, the president and chief executive of Global Refuge, calling the bill an abandonment of "our legal and moral obligations to people seeking refuge."
Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, indicated in a statement that he was holding his nose while supporting the bill, in large part because the future and fate of Europe were tied up in the mix.
"The bipartisan agreement may help, but nothing short of comprehensive reform will truly solve this problem," he said in a carefully worded statement. On the Senate floor, he bemoaned the fact that the measure would provide no relief for Dreamers.
"Without congressional action, they spent each day in fear of being deported," he said. "They grew up alongside our kids; many have gone on to serve our nation."
The Congressional Hispanic Caucus said on Monday evening that funding for Ukraine was not enough of a reason to back a bill that included policies that were not in line with its values.
"We cannot just throw up our hands and accept bad immigration policies that gut asylum, and could set back real bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform 10 to 15 years, for temporary aid," Representative Nanette Barragán of California, the chairwoman of the caucus, said in a statement.

WASHINGTON — Republicans in Congress who have spent months demanding that any aid to Ukraine be paired with a crackdown against migration into the United States got what they asked for when a bipartisan group of senators released a $118.3 billion agreement that would provide both.
On Monday, many of them rejected it anyway.
It was the latest indication that the political ground for any agreement on immigration — particularly in an election year when it is expected to be a central issue of the presidential campaign — has vanished.
With former President Donald Trump eager to attack President Joe Biden’s record on the border and right-wing Republicans in Congress falling in line behind him, a compromise was always going to be a long shot. The long-awaited release Sunday night of the text of the 370-page bill only served to inflame Republican divisions on an issue that once united them.
Even as Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader and a champion of funding for Ukraine, took to the floor to push for action on the bill, many of his fellow Republican leaders were savaging it. Speaker Mike Johnson denounced the measure as “even worse than we expected” and, in a joint statement with his leadership team, repeated what had become his mantra about the deal — that it would be “dead on arrival” in the House.
Even more temperate Republican voices like Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who had encouraged the negotiations, said that after reviewing it, he harbored “serious concerns.” (Cornyn, who is often mentioned as a potential successor to McConnell as the Republican leader, notably gave the statement to the hard-right news outlet Breitbart.)
It pointed to a bleak outlook for the complicated compromise bill that followed a long-standing pattern on Capitol Hill, where major immigration agreements have often come close to enactment only to fall apart just before the finish line after Republicans condemn them as too weak.
The first test for the measure will come Wednesday, when an initial procedural vote is planned. It needs 60 votes to advance, meaning at least 10 Republicans would have to back it. Even if the bill scales that hurdle and could pass the Senate, there appears to be no path forward in the House.
“The $64,000 question now is whether or not senators can drown out the outside noise, drown out people like Donald Trump who want chaos and do the right thing for America,” Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the majority leader, said in a speech on the Senate floor Monday afternoon. “I urge senators of goodwill on both sides of the aisle to do the right thing and tune the chaos out.”
Schumer reminded his colleagues that “we live in an era of divided government, and that means that both sides need to compromise if we want to pass a bill.”
Yet the Republicans’ retreat from the deal also threatened to sap support on the left, where some Democrats are reluctant to support a bill that pro-immigration groups have denounced as a betrayal of American values and that some conservative groups like the National Border Patrol Council were endorsing.
For Democrats who have pressed for any immigration measure to include legal status for large groups of people in the country without legal permission, including the so-called Dreamers brought to the United States as children, a vote for a bill that contains no such provisions and has no path to becoming law anyway is a bitter pill.
Among Republicans, there is even less enthusiasm for finding any middle ground at the start of an election year in which Trump is already winning nominating contests. He has once again made the border a central plank of his campaign and encouraged Republicans to oppose anything short of the hard-line policies he instituted as president. And his “America First” approach to foreign policy has also helped to sap GOP support for sending aid to Ukraine for its war against Russian aggression.
Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., chair of the Senate Republicans’ campaign arm, reiterated Trump’s talking points Monday in saying bluntly that he would be a “no” vote on the bill.
“I can’t support a bill that doesn’t secure the border, provides taxpayer funded lawyers to illegal immigrants and gives billions to radical open borders groups,” he said on social media.
By Monday morning, at least 15 Senate Republicans and three Senate Democrats had made it clear they would oppose the bill, raising questions about whether Schumer and McConnell would be able to deliver the 60 votes necessary for passage.
“Make no mistake, a gauntlet has been thrown and America needs to pick it up,” McConnell said Monday afternoon of sending crucial funding to Ukraine.
In an unusual turn that underscored the Republican divide, a Senate GOP leadership aide who insisted on anonymity circulated a point-by-point rebuttal Monday night to House Republican leaders’ statement criticizing the bill.
In public, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Republican who had joined McConnell in pressing for the bipartisan deal, was noncommittal, suggesting that members of his party might be reluctant to support a measure being criticized as too weak if it could not become law.
“People want a result,” he told reporters. “They want an outcome if we’re going to go through this process.”
Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, who served as the lead Republican negotiator on the border deal, could not mask his frustration with his own party as he sought to explain the final product that was released after more than three months of daily negotiations. The same Republicans who complained that they needed more time to read through the bill, Lankford vented, were rushing to denounce it on social media.
“Are we, as Republicans, going to have press conferences and complain the border is bad and then intentionally leave it open after the worst month in American history in December?” he said on “Fox & Friends.”
The answer was shaping up to be a clear yes.
Some progressive senators also said the deal missed the mark.
Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., who is Hispanic, condemned the bill for failing to provide relief for Dreamers and making it more difficult for migrants to be granted asylum. He lamented that not a single member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus was included in the negotiations.
“While bipartisanship requires political compromise, it does not require compromising our nation’s core values,” said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, the president and CEO of Global Refuge, calling the bill an abandonment of “our legal and moral obligations to people seeking refuge.”
Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, indicated in a statement that he was holding his nose while supporting the bill, in large part because the future and fate of Europe were tied up in the mix.
“The bipartisan agreement may help, but nothing short of comprehensive reform will truly solve this problem,” he said in a carefully worded statement. On the Senate floor, he bemoaned the fact that the measure would provide no relief for Dreamers.
“Without congressional action, they spent each day in fear of being deported,” he said. “They grew up alongside our kids; many have gone on to serve our nation.”
The Congressional Hispanic Caucus said Monday evening that funding for Ukraine was not enough of a reason to back a bill that included policies that were not in line with its values.
“We cannot just throw up our hands and accept bad immigration policies that gut asylum, and could set back real bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform 10 to 15 years, for temporary aid,” Rep. Nanette Barragán, D-Calif., chair of the caucus, said in a statement.

Full text: In testimony before Congress, Christopher A. Wray, the agency's director, said Beijing was preparing to sow chaos if disputes with the United States flared into conflict.
Christopher A. Wray, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, warned on Wednesday that China was ramping up an extensive hacking operation geared at taking down the United States' power grid, oil pipelines and water systems in the event of a conflict over Taiwan.
Mr. Wray, appearing before a House subcommittee on China, offered an alarming assessment of the Chinese Communist Party's efforts. Its intent is to sow confusion, sap the United States' will to fight and hamper the American military from deploying resources if the dispute over Taiwan, a major flashpoint between the two superpowers, escalates into a war, he added.
Before his testimony, F.B.I. and Justice Department officials revealed that last month, they had obtained a court order that authorized them to gain access to servers infiltrated by Volt Typhoon, a Beijing-directed hacking network that has targeted a range of critical infrastructure systems, often by infiltrating small businesses, contractors or local government networks.
"China's hackers are positioning on American infrastructure in preparation to wreak havoc and cause real-world harm to American citizens and communities, if or when China decides the time has come to strike," said Mr. Wray, who pressed the committee to increase funding for the bureau.
"Low blows against civilians are part of China's plan," he added.
Hackers for Volt Typhoon compromised hundreds of Cisco and NetGear routers, many of them outdated models no longer supported by manufacturer updates or security patches, in an effort to embed an army of sleeper cells that would be activated in a crisis.
In May, U.S. officials warned business, local governments and foreign allies that the group was taking aim at "networks across U.S. critical infrastructure sectors" and was likely to apply the same techniques against other countries.
The operation was stopped before it affected the "legitimate functions" of infrastructure agencies and China did not seem to have collected "content information" from the routers.
The government is informing owners of the equipment, officials said.
Speaking to reporters a day earlier, Gen Paul M. Nakasone, the director of the National Security Agency and the head of Cyber Command, said his organizations were working with partners to better understand what China was doing with the Volt Typhoon intrusions on critical infrastructure. "We have found the Chinese in our critical infrastructure and that's just wrong," he said.
In his testimony, Mr. Wray said a major hurdle in countering Chinese hacking operations was the reluctance of small business owners and local governments to inform the F.B.I. of suspicious activity on their networks, which could "prevent the attack from metastasizing to other sectors and other businesses."
Also on Wednesday, the department unsealed an indictment against four Chinese citizens. They are accused of operating a yearslong conspiracy to smuggle electronic components from the United States to Iran, in violation of longstanding sanctions and restrictions on the export of military technology to the Islamic Republic.
The suspects, who all live in China, are charged with using front companies to funnel components that could be used to build drones and ballistic missile systems to Iran from 2007 to at least 2020, according to the indictment in Federal District Court in Washington.
As a result, a "vast amount" of U.S. technology was diverted to Iran, prosecutors said. They did not specify the potential harm to national security.
In recent months, the F.B.I. and Justice Department have intensified their warnings about malicious activity by China, Iran and Russia inside the United States. Those include murder-for-hire plots against dissidents, efforts to infiltrate U.S. law enforcement agencies, election interference, intellectual property theft and online breaches like those Mr. Wray and cybersecurity officials identified at the hearing on Wednesday.
Mr. Wray has for years emphasized the threat from China, describing it as existential.
"It's a threat to our economic security -- and by extension, to our national security," Mr. Wray said in 2020.
China has often taken aim at the weakest links in the country's business and government networks, particularly outdated home-office routers that allow them to hack into more sophisticated computer systems, officials said.
The goal is to "induce societal panic" to discourage the United States from supporting Taiwan or more aggressively confronting Beijing on other geopolitical and economic issues, said Jen Easterly, the director of the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.
Ms. Easterly suggested that officials in Beijing might have been motivated to focus on civilian infrastructure after the 2021 ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline by a Russian hacking collective.
"Imagine that on a massive scale -- imagine not one pipeline, but many pipelines disrupted," she said. "Telecommunications going down so people can't use their cellphone. People start getting sick from polluted water. Trains get derailed."
Beijing has long denied targeting U.S. civilian infrastructure, and senior Chinese officials recently told the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, that they would not influence the outcome of the 2024 election by infiltrating networks.
American hackers target China's military and government servers, but have historically avoided the kind of infrastructure attacks directed by Beijing, General Nakasone said in his testimony on Wednesday.
"Responsible cyberactors of democracies like our own do not target the civilian infrastructure," he said. "There's no reason for them to be in our water. There's no reason for them to be in our power. This is a decision by an actor to actually focus on civilian targets."

Extinction Panic Is Back, Right on Schedule: [Op-Ed]

Full text: "Do you think we'll need to buy guns?" The student's question seemed to drop the temperature in the room by several degrees. I was at a dinner with fellow academics, a few college students and a guest speaker who had just delivered an inspiring talk about climate justice.
Sensing confusion, the student clarified: Planetary catastrophe was inevitable in the near term, which means people would soon be living behind walled communities. Since Republicans would be armed, she said, she just wanted to know how to keep the people she cared about safe. The guest speaker took a moment to process this information, then suggested that the student worry more about growing vegetables than about buying guns.
That conversation has stuck with me over the years not because the student's views were unusual but because they've become commonplace. The literary scholar Paul Saint-Amour has described the expectation of apocalypse -- the sense that all history's catastrophes and geopolitical traumas are leading us to "the prospect of an even more devastating futurity" -- as the quintessential modern attitude. It's visible everywhere in what has come to be known as the polycrisis.
Climate anxiety, of the sort expressed by that student, is driving new fields in psychology, experimental therapies and debates about what a recent New Yorker article called "the morality of having kids in a burning, drowning world." Our public health infrastructure groans under the weight of a lingering pandemic while we are told to expect worse contagions to come. The near coup at OpenAI, which resulted at least in part from a dispute about whether artificial intelligence could soon threaten humanity with extinction, is only the latest example of our ballooning angst about technology overtaking us.
Meanwhile, some experts are warning of imminent population collapse. Elon Musk, who donated $ 10 million to researchers studying fertility and population decline, called it "a much bigger risk to civilization than global warming." Politicians on both sides of the aisle speak openly about the possibility that conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East could spark World War III. Donald Trump has made "the N-word" -- he hastens to specify "the nuclear word" -- a talking point at his rallies. The conviction that the human species could be on its way out, extinguished by our own selfishness and violence, may well be the last bipartisan impulse.
In a certain sense, none of this is new. Apocalyptic anxieties are a mainstay of human culture. But they are not a constant. In response to rapid changes in science, technology and geopolitics, they tend to spike into brief but intense extinction panics -- periods of acute pessimism about humanity's future -- before quieting again as those developments are metabolized. These days, it can feel as though the existential challenges humanity faces are unprecedented. But a major extinction panic happened 100 years ago, and the similarities are unnerving.
The 1920s were also a period when the public -- traumatized by a recent pandemic, a devastating world war and startling technological developments -- was gripped by the conviction that humanity might soon shuffle off this mortal coil.
Understanding the extinction panic of the 1920s is useful to understanding our tumultuous 2020s and the gloomy mood that pervades the decade.
Hearing that historical echo doesn't mean that today's fears have no basis. Rather, it is crucial to helping us blow away the smoke of age-old alarmism from the very real fires that threaten our civilization. It also helps us see how apocalyptic fears feed off the idea that people are inherently violent, self-interested and hierarchical and that survival is a zero-sum war over resources. That suite of ideas is traditionally associated with political conservatism, though it can apply as easily to left-wing climate doom as to right-wing survivalist ideology. Either way, it's a cynical view that encourages us to take our demise as a foregone conclusion.
What makes an extinction panic a panic is the conviction that humanity is flawed and beyond redemption, destined to die at its own hand, the tragic hero of a terrestrial pageant for whom only one final act is possible. The irony, of course, is that this cynicism -- and the unfettered individualism that is its handmaiden -- greases the skids to calamity. After all, why bother fighting for change or survival if you believe that self-destruction is hard-wired into humanity? What the history of prior extinction panics has to teach us is that this pessimism is both politically questionable and questionably productive. Our survival will depend on our ability to recognize and reject the nihilistic appraisals of humanity that inflect our fears for the future, both left and right.
As a scholar who researches the history of Western fears about human extinction, I'm often asked how I avoid sinking into despair. My answer is always that learning about the history of extinction panics is actually liberating, even a cause for optimism. Some of these earlier panics were caused by faulty, misinterpreted or creatively applied scientific developments. New paleontological and geological theories stoked a rash of extinction discourse in early-19th-century England, for example, and experts ginned up fears of famine and population explosion in the 1960s and '70s. Other moments of paranoia, like the various spasms of nuclear-induced distress during the Cold War, were grounded in all-too-real threats. Nearly every generation has thought its generation was to be the last, and yet the human species has persisted. As a character in Jeanette Winterson's novel "The Stone Gods" says, "History is not a suicide note -- it is a record of our survival."
***
Contrary to the folk wisdom that insists the years immediately after World War I were a period of good times and exuberance, dark clouds often hung over the 1920s. The dread of impending disaster -- from another world war, the supposed corruption of racial purity and the prospect of automated labor -- saturated the period just as much as the bacchanals and black market booze for which it is infamous. The '20s were indeed roaring, but they were also reeling. And the figures articulating the doom were far from fringe.
On Oct. 30, 1924 -- top hat in hand, sporting the dour, bulldog grimace for which he was well known -- Winston Churchill stood on a spartan stage, peering over the shoulder of a man holding a newspaper that announced Churchill's return to Parliament. He won the Epping seat the day before, after two years out of Parliament. The dapper clothes of the assembled politicians and his wife in heels and furs were almost comically incongruous with their setting: a drab building with dirty windows and stained corrugated siding. It was a fitting metaphor for both the decade and for the future prime minister's mood. Churchill was feeling pessimistic.
The previous year saw the publication of the first of several installments of what many would come to consider his finest literary achievement, "The World Crisis," a grim retrospective of World War I that laid out, as Churchill put it, the "milestones to Armageddon." In September1924, one month before his Epping election, two other notable events in Churchill's intellectual life -- one major, one minor -- offered signs of his growing gloominess. The major event was his decision to run for Parliament as a constitutionalist with Conservative Party support, marking the end of his long affiliation with the Liberal Party and the beginning of a further rightward drift. The minor event was the publication of a bleak essay that argued new war machines may soon wipe out our species.
Bluntly titled "Shall We All Commit Suicide?," the essay offered a dismal appraisal of humanity's prospects. "Certain somber facts emerge solid, inexorable, like the shapes of mountains from drifting mist," Churchill wrote. "Mankind has never been in this position before. Without having improved appreciably in virtue or enjoying wiser guidance, it has got into its hands for the first time the tools by which it can unfailingly accomplish its own extermination."
In an eerie foreshadowing of atomic weapons, he went on to ask, "Might not a bomb no bigger than an orange be found to possess a secret power to destroy a whole block of buildings -- nay, to concentrate the force of a thousand tons of cordite and blast a township at a stroke?" He concluded the essay by asserting that the war that had just consumed Europe might be "but a pale preliminary" of the horrors to come.
That Churchill had human extinction on his mind at the same time that he was contemplating the Conservative Party's offer may or may not be an accident of biography and history, but it is telling all the same. The essay -- with its declaration that "the story of the human race is war" and its dismay at "the march of science unfolding ever more appalling possibilities" -- is filled with right-wing pathos and holds out little hope that mankind might possess the wisdom to outrun the reaper. This fatalistic assessment was shared by many, including those well to Churchill's left.
Around the same time that Churchill foretold the coming of "means of destruction incalculable in their effects," the science fiction novelist H.G. Wells, who in his era was also famous for socialist political commentary, expressed the same doleful outlook. Writing from Easton Glebe, his sprawling, ruddy-bricked Georgian home on an equally sprawling estate, the writer applied himself to the dark art of prophecy. When he was not playing with toy soldiers in the verdant garden or, on rainy days, teaching eminent guests the barn game -- by all accounts, a pleasant diversion that involved a large ball and an ever-changing set of rules -- Wells was busy contemplating the rather less merry prospect of human extinction.
"Are not we and they and all the race still just as much adrift in the current of circumstances as we were before 1914?" he wondered. Wells predicted that our inability to learn from the mistakes of the Great War would "carry our race on surely and inexorably to fresh wars, to shortages, hunger, miseries and social debacles, at last either to complete extinction or to a degradation beyond our present understanding." Humanity, the don of sci-fi correctly surmised, was rushing headlong into a "scientific war" that would "make the biggest bombs of 1918 seem like little crackers."
The pathbreaking biologist J.B.S. Haldane, another socialist, concurred with Wells's view of warfare's ultimate destination. In 1925, two decades before the Trinity test birthed an atomic sun over the New Mexico desert, Haldane, who experienced bombing firsthand during World War I, mused, "If we could utilize the forces which we now know to exist inside the atom, we should have such capacities for destruction that I do not know of any agency other than divine intervention which would save humanity from complete and peremptory annihilation." One year earlier, F.C.S. Schiller, a British philosopher and eugenicist, summarized the general intellectual atmosphere of the 1920s aptly: "Our best prophets are growing very anxious about our future. They are afraid we are getting to know too much and are likely to use our knowledge to commit suicide."
Other prominent interwar intellectuals worried about developments in nonmilitary technologies. Many of the same fears that keep A.I. engineers up at night -- calibrating thinking machines to human values, concern that our growing reliance on technology might sap human ingenuity and even trepidation about a robot takeover -- made their debut in the early 20th century.
The Czech playwright Karel Capek's 1920 drama, "R.U.R.," imagined a future in which artificially intelligent robots wiped out humanity. In a scene that would strike fear into the hearts of Silicon Valley doomers, a character in the play observes: "They've ceased to be machines. They're already aware of their superiority, and they hate us as they hate everything human." As the A.I. godfather Geoffrey Hinton, who quit his job at Google so he could warn the world about the very technology he helped create, explained, "What we want is some way of making sure that even if" these systems are "smarter than us, they're going to do things that are beneficial for us."
This fear of a new machine age wasn't quarantined to fiction. The popular detective novelist R. Austin Freeman's 1921 political treatise, "Social Decay and Regeneration," warned that our reliance on new technologies was driving our species toward degradation and even annihilation, an argument The New York Times reviewed with enthusiasm. Others went to even greater lengths to act on their machine-age angst. In 1923, when "R.U.R." opened in Tokyo, a Japanese biology professor, Makoto Nishimura, became so convinced by the machine-facilitated extinction the play depicts that he sought to create other, benevolent robots to prevent the human species from being "destroyed by the pinnacle of its creation," artificial man.
***
One way to understand extinction panics is as elite panics: fears created and curated by social, political and economic movers and shakers during times of uncertainty and social transition. Extinction panics are, in both the literal and the vernacular senses, reactionary, animated by the elite's anxiety about maintaining its privilege in the midst of societal change. Today it's politicians, executives and technologists. A century ago it was eugenicists and right-leaning politicians like Churchill and socialist scientists like Haldane. That ideologically varied constellation of prominent figures shared a basic diagnosis of humanity and its prospects: that our species is fundamentally vicious and selfish and our destiny therefore bends inexorably toward self-destruction.
To whatever extent, then, that the diagnosis proved prophetic, it's worth asking if it might have been at least partly self-fulfilling.
Despite the similarities between the current moment and the previous roaring and risky '20s, today's problems are fundamentally new. So, too, must be our solutions. It is a tired observation that those who don't know history are destined to repeat it. We live in a peculiar moment in which this wisdom is precisely inverted. Making it to the next century may well depend on learning from and repeating the tightrope walk -- between technological progress and self-annihilation -- that we have been doing for the past 100 years. It will depend, too, on rejecting the conservative doommongering that defines our present: the entangled convictions that we are too selfish to forestall climate change, too violent to prevent war with China, too greedy to develop A.I. slowly and safely.
Extinction panics are often fomented by elites, but that doesn't mean we have to defer to elites for our solutions. We have gotten into the dangerous habit of outsourcing big issues -- space exploration, clean energy, A.I. and the like -- to private businesses and billionaires. Our survival may well depend on reversing this trend. We need ambitious, well-resourced government initiatives and international cooperation that takes A.I. and other existential risks seriously. It's time we started treating these issues as urgent public priorities and funding them accordingly.
The first step is refusing to indulge in certainty, the fiction that the future is foretold. There is a perverse comfort to dystopian thinking. The conviction that catastrophe is baked in relieves us of the moral obligation to act. But as the extinction panic of the 1920s shows us, action is possible, and these panics can recede.
Less than a year after Churchill's warning about the future of modern combat -- "As for poison gas and chemical warfare," he wrote, "only the first chapter has been written of a terrible book" -- the 1925 Geneva Protocol was signed, an international agreement banning the use of chemical or biological weapons in combat. Despite the many horrors of World War II, chemical weapons were not deployed on European battlefields.
As for machine-age angst, there's a lesson to learn there, too: Our panics are often puffed up, our predictions simply wrong. Human life and labor were not superseded by machines, as some in the 1920s predicted. Or in the 1960s or in the 1980s, two other flash-in-the-pan periods of A.I. hype. The takeaway is not that we shouldn't be worried but that we shouldn't panic. Foretelling doom is an ancient human hobby, but we don't appear to be very good at it.
In 1928, H.G. Wells published a book titled, "The Way the World Is Going," with the modest subtitle, "Guesses and Forecasts of the Years Ahead." In the opening pages, he offered a summary of his age that could just as easily have been written about our turbulent 2020s. "Human life," he wrote, "is different from what it has ever been before, and it is rapidly becoming more different." He continued: "Perhaps never in the whole history of life before the present time, has there been a living species subjected to so fiercely urgent, many-sided and comprehensive a process of change as ours today. None at least that has survived. Transformation or extinction have been nature's invariable alternatives. Ours is a species in an intense phase of transition." Much turns, as the novelist well knew, on that ambiguous final word. Both transformation and extinction are transitions, after all.
Wells once quipped that after he died, his epitaph should read: "I told you so. You damned fools." He went out of his way to note that the italics were his choice, and the emphasis suggests that we might understand him to mean "damned" not just in the vernacular but also in the older sense of the word: The human species is condemned, a gaggle of fated fools that will inevitably follow our machines off that final precipice. Wells died in August 1946, a year after another of his uncanny predictions, the atomic bomb, was released on two Japanese cities, heralding the nuclear age. We have every reason to believe he went to his final rest sure that he was right. Perhaps he was even grateful that he had been spared the consumption of human civilization in atomic fire.
Yet even as the author's words remain prescient, returning to such warnings a century later provides something akin to hope, maybe even optimism. We are living in the very world that many in the 1920s already saw coming. But we're also doing something they could not have predicted: surviving it. At least for now.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The former president's opposition has all but killed the prospects for a bipartisan border deal, reflecting how his influence in Congress has grown as he gains ground in the Republican primary.
For months, Senate Republicans have been working with Democrats on a deal they have described as a once-in-a-generation opportunity for a conservative border security bill, and for weeks, they have hinted that they are tantalizingly close to an agreement.
Their timing could not be worse.
As former President Donald J. Trump moves closer to becoming his party's presidential nominee and Republican lawmakers consolidate behind him, he is wielding a heavier hand than any time since leaving office over his party's agenda in Congress. His vocal opposition to the emerging border compromise has all but killed the measure's chances in a divided Congress as he puts his own hard-line immigration policies once again at the center of his presidential campaign.
His shadow has always loomed large over the Republican-controlled House, which has opened congressional investigations to defend him, launched an impeachment inquiry into his chief rival and approved legislation to reinstate the hard-line immigration policies he imposed. But as Mr. Trump barrels toward the party's 2024 nomination, his influence on the legislative agenda on Capitol Hill is expanding.
His "America First" approach to foreign policy already helped to sap G.O.P. support for sending aid to Ukraine for its war against Russian aggression, placing the fate of that money in doubt. That led Republicans to demand a border crackdown in exchange for any further funding for Kyiv, a compromise that Mr. Trump has now repudiated. He frequently consults with the inexperienced Speaker Mike Johnson, weighing in on policy and politics. And his uncompromising approach has emboldened copycat politicians in Congress, like Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Matt Gaetz of Florida, who are helping to drive an ongoing impasse over government spending.
For a Congress that has struggled for more than a year to do the bare minimum of legislating, Mr. Trump's dominance among Republicans is yet another drag on the institution's ability to function in an election year when his name is likely to be on the ballot.
Mr. Trump burst onto the national political scene in 2015 with a dark warning about dangerous immigrants invading the country's southern border and one slogan that outlasted them all in "Build the Wall." More than eight years later, he is agitating against compromise and saying he wants no action taken on the border "unless we get EVERYTHING needed to shut down the INVASION."
With more than half of Senate Republicans now officially backing Mr. Trump's bid for president, those entreaties are becoming harder to ignore as prattle from Palm Beach.
On Wednesday, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader and a champion of the emerging bipartisan border deal, acknowledged as much. He told Republicans privately that Mr. Trump's growing influence has complicated the politics of the border, dividing Republicans against one another on an issue that once united the party.
Republicans are "in a quandary," Mr. McConnell said in a closed-door meeting on Wednesday, according to lawmakers who attended. What was supposed to be the sweetener for conservatives opposed to sending tens of billions of dollars to Ukraine had become just as politically treacherous terrain as the foreign aid itself, he acknowledged. Mr. McConnell, himself, regards the border deal as less important than sending military aid to Ukraine.
On Thursday, after members grew alarmed that Mr. McConnell's message signaled the death knell for any potential deal, he clarified in a second meeting that he was still moving ahead with the border-Ukraine package. Still, the road is less certain than it was last year, before Mr. Trump began winning nominating contests.
Senators have been working on a border deal since just before Thanksgiving. But as the complicated talks have dragged on, Mr. Trump has begun collecting delegates and pressing for the party to coalesce around him and his agenda. His allies in Congress are clamoring for their colleagues to treat him like the party's de facto leader and fall in line with his policies.
Mr. Trump and House Republicans want more severe immigration measures that stand no chance of passing the Democratic-controlled Senate or being signed by President Biden. Those include an end to grants of parole that allow migrants to live and work temporarily in the United States without visas while they await the outcome of their immigration claims, and a revival of the "Remain in Mexico" policy, which blocked their entry and forced them to wait elsewhere.
Mr. Trump's influence over the agenda in Congress has sometimes been overblown, but he has always had far more power to derail things than to help lawmakers find consensus. He was unable to help his chosen candidate for speaker, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, get over the finish line in October, after Kevin McCarthy was ousted from the post, for example. But he had the ability to tank the bid of a lawmaker he opposed, Representative Tom Emmer of Minnesota, with one derisive social media post.
Mr. McCarthy worked hard last year to keep Mr. Trump quiet as he negotiated with Mr. Biden over a deal to avoid a federal debt default, aware that Mr. Trump had the power to drag away some critical Republican votes if he railed against it. Mr. McCarthy was able to pass it with a majority of the G.O.P. in support, in part because Mr. Trump waited until it was signed to criticize it.
But Mr. Trump was not yet winning nominating contests then, and spending cuts have never been the animating issue of his political identity.
Attacking Mr. Biden's handling of the border is already a main plank of Mr. Trump's campaign. He has accused Mr. Biden of instituting "open border" policies that allow terrorists and fentanyl to pour into the country, while vowing to build "even more wall" along the southern border. A Trump campaign ad claims that Mr. Biden's immigration policies raise "the possibility of a Hamas attack" in the United States.
It is not clear yet whether Mr. Trump's political agenda will derail other opportunities for bipartisan lawmaking this year on Capitol Hill, the prospects for which were already bleak given the electoral calendar and the dysfunction of the current Congress. Conservatives have already begun agitating against a bipartisan tax bill, whose passage could be construed as a victory for Mr. Biden since it would expand the child tax credit. Mr. Trump has yet to weigh in.
On Thursday, Republican supporters of the border deal were livid at the notion that Mr. Trump could potentially tank their painstakingly negotiated deal from the campaign trail.
"I think we have to have people here who support Trump, who have endorsed President Trump, go to him and tell him what a compelling case this is for someone who is likely to be our next president of the United States," said Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina. "Don't pretend that the policy isn't strong. If you want to admit you're just afraid to tell President Trump the truth, that's fine."
Mr. Tillis said that to condemn the Senate proposal as too weak meant that "either you aren't paying attention or you aren't telling the truth."
Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota, said that Mr. Biden had a clear political problem on his hands at the southern border and "the politics would suggest that you allow him to boil in his own oil on this particular subject matter."
He said the Senate still had an obligation to pass legislation to strengthen the country's border, even if doing so would give Mr. Biden a political win. That does not appear to be the position most of his colleagues are taking.
Senator Christopher S. Murphy, the Connecticut Democrat who has been playing a lead role in the negotiations, said Mr. Trump's opposition to the deal should come as no surprise.
"That is the cold, hard reality of Donald Trump, who just sees the border as a political issue, not as a policy problem to solve," Mr. Murphy said.
Some hard-right Senate Republicans who are deeply opposed to the emerging deal accused Mr. McConnell of trying to pin its demise on Mr. Trump. Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, said Mr. McConnell was "trying to shift blame to President Trump for what I would say are his failed negotiations."
Senator J.D. Vance, Republican of Ohio, said it was shortsighted to send a "weak sauce" border security bill to the House, where Speaker Johnson has suggested it would be dead on arrival. That strategy Mr. Vance said, "allows the president to blame 'MAGA' Republicans for the failure of a border security package when in reality, what failed was a very weak border security package that didn't actually do anything."

You Can Be Isolated, Even Amid a Crowd: [Review]

Full text: Daisy Ridley stars as an office worker who's just going through the motions.
Fran thinks about dying, but not gruesomely. Her mental tableaux of death look as if they were staged by the artist Gregory Crewdson. Sometimes her body is draped dramatically over driftwood on a serene beach or posed in a foggy forest on a soft green bed of moss. She imagines standing alone in a nondescript finished office basement as a giant snake slithers by. She imagines death, essentially, as peace in the midst of ever-changing nature.
Her reality is less beautifully hued. By day, Fran (Daisy Ridley) dons drab business casual and works in the sort of space that makes the environs of "The Office" seem like a magical wonderland. A small group of people perform clerical tasks to keep the local port in their tiny Pacific Northwest town running smoothly, and spend most of their time on crushingly banal chatter. Why is this cruise ship docked in such a way that it blocks the views of the mountains? Where are the mugs?
By night, Fran's life isn't much more interesting, but at least she's in control of it. She goes home, pours a glass of wine and takes a long, restorative sip, then reheats some kind of insipid patty and eats it with a side of cottage cheese. Sudoku, brush teeth, bed, repeat. It feels like she's starring in her own one-woman play, one where all other people are background noise -- her mother's phone call goes to voice mail -- and nobody is watching.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"Sometimes I Think About Dying," directed by Rachel Lambert, comes by its theatricality naturally; it's based, in part, on the play "Killers" by Kevin Armento. (The other credited writers are Stefanie Abel Horowitz and Katy Wright-Mead, the latter of whose credits include "Boardwalk Empire" and "The Knick.") The play entwined the tale of a young woman who thinks about dying with a secondary story about a young woman obsessed with killing, and though I haven't seen it, I assume that means its themes were very different. But onscreen, "Sometimes I Think About Dying" can do what it could never do as easily onstage: We float in and out of Fran's mind, entering her mood, her lethargy, her fixations on the back of people's heads or their mouths while they speak. We start to become a little bit Fran.
Perhaps the best term for Fran's persistent mood is acedia, that feeling of not caring much about anything, especially one's position in the world. (Ancient monks called it the "noonday demon.") It's often equated with depression, but there's a particular torpor provoked by a soul-sucking office that can bring it on. Many a new college graduate has discovered, quickly, that a 9-to-5 job can become unbearable even if the work itself is simple, pleasant and well-paid. Something about the prospect of everlasting sameness can sap the will to live.
Fran's co-workers seem to have compensated by developing cheesy chipper mannerisms in the office, or rich lives outside of them. It's the latter that attracts Fran to Richard (Dave Merheje), the new guy, a self-declared movie obsessive who takes the place of beloved Carol (Marcia DeBonis) after she retires and heads out on a long-awaited cruise with her husband. Richard takes a liking to mousy Fran, who quietly declares in their team-building exercise that her favorite food is cottage cheese. He invites her to a movie that evening. She hates it. He loves it. And Fran, fascinated by this man who likes things, starts to imagine a different kind of life.
"Sometimes I Think About Dying" premiered at last year's Sundance Film Festival, where "Eileen" also made its debut, and there's a striking similarity between the woman at each movie's center. They're both lonely and isolated while in the midst of people; they're both frustrating to those around them; they're both prone to imagining things that might scandalize others; and they've both found a measure of relief in a bottle. In other words, they're both -- dreaded terms -- unlikable, a kind of woman that's cropped up a lot in cinema lately, from the women of "May December" to Lydia Tár.
But distinctive from Eileen, Fran is very relatable. We don't know why Fran is the way she is, or much of anything about her, but we know that she finds many things, in her words, "not interesting," including herself. We get the sense that her isolation stems from assuming others would be bored by her if they actually knew anything about her. When Robert asks her what she likes to do, she says she cooks sometimes. "What do you like to cook?" he asks. "Different things," she replies.
A movie like this one, reserved and a little mysterious, can be unnerving. Occasionally it feels as if "Sometimes I Think About Dying" is a bit too withholding, dragging down the story it has to tell. But there's a lot here to like. It's never entirely clear, until late in the film, what Fran is thinking, or whether she's truly as blank a slate as she presents herself to be. Ridley's performance is affectless and deadpan, until it isn't. (There's more than one reason I thought while watching the film of Aki Kaurismaki's "Fallen Leaves.") The moment of emotional revelation comes as a start.
But movies that leave you a little confused, leaning in and projecting yourself onto the characters, are often the best ones, and the cinema of drudgery can engage that impulse like few others. "Sometimes I Think About Dying" isn't as masterful as "Jeanne Dielman" or "The Assistant," but there's a familiarity to the way it renders everyday life: as a cell, in which a woman has stripped herself of choice and possibility in order to survive.
At the end of the film, Fran encounters her former co-worker Carol, whose life has not gone as planned. "Every day I get up and I see the day out there and I get my coffee and I sit here and I think, all right. All right. This is what I have right now," Carol tells Fran. "And no matter how much better whatever I imagine in my head is, it's not as real as what I do have. So -- it's hard, isn't it? Being a person?"
Fran watches her across the table and nods, something blooming in her mind. Carol, too, had her fantasies. So maybe thinking about dying -- or anything -- is how we escape a fallow existence. But maybe fresh life blooms only when you're willing to get your hands dirty.

WASHINGTON — For months, Senate Republicans have been working with Democrats on a deal they have described as a once-in-a-generation opportunity for a conservative border security bill, and for weeks, they have hinted that they are tantalizingly close to an agreement.

Full text: With a decisive turn toward youth and conservative ideas, the French president sets a path for his reshuffled government.
The political ideology known as "Macronism" has always been about action, even agitation, at least in verbal form. Emmanuel Macron burst onto the scene in 2017 promising a "revolution." Since then, over more than six years as France's president, he has embraced a "refoundation" and renamed his political party "Renaissance." Now, he's calling for civic "rearmament."
It is perhaps not evident from this re-energizing lexicon of a restless man that in many ways Mr. Macron, 46, has moved in a conservative direction. The other word beginning with "R" that characterizes a president whose roots lie in the Socialist Party is "rightward."
Mr. Macron's prime-time news conference this week was laced with the words "order" and "respect" as the president called for "La Marseillaise," France's national anthem, to be learned in primary school and for the experimental reintroduction of school uniforms.
He would, he said, dedicate himself to ensuring that "France remains France," reintroducing civics lessons, instituting a form of mandatory community service for teenagers, combating illegal immigration and doubling the police presence in the streets to fight drugs and "incivility." Mr. Macron had clearly freed his inner de Gaulle.
As nods and winks to the right go, his performance was conspicuous. "Macronism is dead, long live SarkoMacronism!" Franz-Olivier Giesbert wrote in the weekly newsmagazine Le Point, alluding to former President Nicolas Sarkozy, a right-wing politician with an Energizer Bunny style.
This was perhaps a little unfair to Mr. Macron, who delivered a 150-minute tour de force that addressed every dossier from the war in Ukraine to the spread of infertility in French society. His performance was also a reminder for Americans of what youth can deliver in politics.
Mr. Macron's aim was to set a course for his new government, headed by Gabriel Attal, who, at 34, is the youngest prime minister in modern French history.
The composition of Mr. Attal's government, with eight of the 15 ministries held by politicians who came from the center-right party Les Républicains, was already a clear indication that Mr. Macron was done with the ambiguity that earned him the sobriquet of the "at-the-same-time" president.
The decisive turn to youth and to the right reflected several things, officials close to Mr. Macron said. Morale at the Élysée Palace had been low with "lame-duck" mutterings multiplying as the president, who is term limited and must leave office in 2027, confronted growing unpopularity and cast around for a sense of direction. About two-thirds of the country is hostile to him, according to polls.
Because the main challenge to Mr. Macron comes from the extreme right, in the form of the perennial presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, and because he depends on support in the National Assembly from the center-right Republicans party to pass legislation, the president had a strong incentive to act.
He does not have an absolute majority in Parliament, a quandary that no verbal acrobatics will dispel.
At the news conference, Mr. Macron called Ms. Le Pen's National Rally "the party of collective impoverishment," and vowed to remedy "the sense of dispossession" felt by some French people -- an apparent reference to the consequences of immigration, particularly from North Africa, that Ms. Le Pen has exploited with her xenophobic invective.
The most immediate political test of Mr. Macron's decisions will come in the European Parliament elections in June.
The president wants to head off a far-right victory by countering the charismatic appeal of Jordan Bardella, the 28-year-old president of the National Rally. Mr. Macron has now deployed Mr. Attal, whose telegenic assurance and ready adaptability make him a natural protégé of the president, against the youthful rightist leader.
Beyond the election, Mr. Macron will rely on Mr. Attal to sap the popularity of Ms. Le Pen through tough measures on immigration and security. "France will never rhyme with decline," Mr. Attal said in his acceptance speech earlier this month. He used the words "strong" and "strength" six times.
The Paris Olympics are coming this summer, and the president is counting on a triumphant moment of beauty and pageantry from the banks of the Seine to the northern suburbs to give his presidency a lift. He announced on Thursday that access to cultural performances of all kinds would be free for two months over the summer to mark the Olympics.
The puzzle of Mr. Macron's unpopularity is that, on many levels, he has been a successful president -- overcoming the wave of Yellow Vest protests, beating the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic, bringing unemployment down sharply to a little over 7 percent, maintaining modest growth despite the effects of the war in Ukraine and attracting high levels of foreign investment.
Indeed, France has recently had reason to gloat. Its neighbor Germany, which entered a recession last year, has grown only 0.7 percent since 2019 and is facing widespread street protests provoked in part by a decision to phase out diesel fuel subsidies -- the very issue that sparked the French Yellow Vest movement in 2018.
The case that the French economy is stronger today than the erstwhile German powerhouse appears persuasive.
France, with its successful reliance on nuclear power for about 60 to 70 percent of its electricity generation, enjoys ridiculing Germany's lack of domestic energy sources. At the same time, the rapid rise in Germany of the far right Alternative for Germany party, known as the AfD, has reflected a crisis of confidence and malaise more usually associated with France. The National Rally is an old phenomenon that has now entered the political mainstream; the strength of the AfD in Germany is a shocking new one.
Can Mr. Macron translate any of these achievements into greater popularity? The answer is unclear because much of the dislike of him lies more in feeling than analysis -- a sense that he is somehow alien, too self-regarding, too enamored of his own voice, a man from "Jupiter" who does not know how to pat the backside of a cow, an essential French political qualification.
One thing is clear: He has rolled the dice to keep Ms. Le Pen from the highest office in the land, and the clock is now ticking. As for France remaining France, that will no doubt take care of itself.

Death by a Thousand Paper Cuts: [Op-Ed]

Full text: Sometimes in this job I have a kernel of a column idea that doesn't pan out. But other times I begin looking into a topic and find a problem so massive that I can't believe I've ever written about anything else. This latter experience happened as I looked into the growing bureaucratization of American life. It's not only that growing bureaucracies cost a lot of money; they also enervate American society. They redistribute power from workers to rule makers, and in so doing sap initiative, discretion, creativity and drive.
Once you start poking around, the statistics are staggering. Over a third of all health care costs go to administration. As the health care expert David Himmelstein put it in 2020, "The average American is paying more than $ 2,000 a year for useless bureaucracy." All of us who have been entangled in the medical system know why administrators are there: to wrangle over coverage for the treatments doctors think patients need.
The growth of bureaucracy costs America over $ 3 trillion in lost economic output every year, Gary Hamel and Michele Zanini estimated in 2016 in The Harvard Business Review. That was about 17 percent of G.D.P. According to their analysis, there is now one administrator or manager for every 4.7 employees, doing things like designing anti-harassment trainings, writing corporate mission statements, collecting data and managing "systems."
This situation is especially grave in higher education. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology now has almost eight times as many nonfaculty employees as faculty employees. In the University of California system, the number of managers and senior professionals swelled by 60 percent between 2004 and 2014. The number of tenure-track faculty members grew by just 8 percent.
Conservatives complain that diversity, equity and inclusion administrators are injecting a dangerous ideology into American campuses. That's true. But the bigger problem is that these workers are among the swelling ranks of administrators.
The general job of administrators, who are invariably good and well-meaning people, is to supervise and control, and they gain power and job security by hiring more people to work for them to create more supervision and control. In every organization I've interacted with, the administrators genuinely want to serve the mission of the organization, but the nature of their jobs is to enforce compliance with this or that rule.
Their power is similar to what Annie Lowrey of The Atlantic has called the "time tax." If you've ever fought a health care, corporate or university bureaucracy, you quickly realize you don't have the time for it, so you give up. I don't know about you, but my health insurer sometimes denies my family coverage for things that seem like obvious necessities, but I let it go unless it's a major expense. I calculate that my time is more valuable.
As Philip K. Howard has been arguing for years, good organizations give people discretion to do what is right. But the trend in public and private sector organizations has been to write rules that rob people of the power of discretion. These are two different mentalities. As Howard writes, "Studies of cognitive overload suggest that the real problem is that people who are thinking about rules actually have diminished capacity to think about solving problems."
Not long ago, an airline accidentally canceled one of my flight reservations. I called the 800 number and the guy on the other end of the line seemed truly unable to wrap his mind around the idea of getting me on another flight, because the rule said that my reservation was nonrefundable. I had that by now familiar feeling of talking to a brick wall.
This state of affairs pervades American life. Childhood is now thoroughly administered. I'm lucky enough to have grown up at a time when parents let children roam free to invent their own games and solve their own problems. Now kids' activities, from travel sports to recess, are supervised, and rules dominate. Parents are afraid their kids might be harmed, but as Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff have argued, by being overprotective, parents make their kids more fragile and more vulnerable to harm.
High school students design their lives to fit the metrics that college admissions officers require. And what traits are selective schools looking for? They're looking for students who are willing to conform to the formulas the gatekeepers devise.
I've found the administrators' code of safety first is now prevalent at the colleges where I've taught and visited. Aside from being a great school, Stanford used to be a weird school, where students set up idiosyncratic arrangements like an anarchist house or built their own islands in the middle of the lake. This was great preparation for life as a creative entrepreneur. But Stanford is apparently now tamed. I invite you to read Ginevra Davis's essay "Stanford's War on Social Life" in Palladium, which won a vaunted Sidney Award in 2022 and details how university administrators cracked down on student initiatives to make everything boring, supervised and safe.
Professors used to be among the most unsupervised people in America, but even they are feeling the pinch. For example, Mark Edmundson teaches literature at the University of Virginia. The annual self-evaluations he had to submit used to be one page. Now he has to fill out about 15 electronic pages of bureaucratese that include demonstrating how his work advances D.E.I., to make sure his every waking moment conforms to the reigning ideology.
In a recent essay in Liberties Journal, he illustrates how administrators control campus life by citing the rules they have devised to govern how members of the campus community should practice sadomasochistic sex: "When parties consent to BDSM 3, or other forms of kink, nonconsent may be shown by the use of a safe word, whereas actions and words that may signal nonconsent in non-kink situations, such as force or violence, may be deemed signals of consent." Do institutions really need to govern private life this minutely?
Organizations are trying to protect themselves from lawsuits, but the whole administrative apparatus comes with an implied view of human nature. People are weak, fragile, vulnerable and kind of stupid. They need administrators to run their lives. They have to be trained never to take initiative, lest they wander off into activities that are deemed by the authorities to be out of bounds.
The result is the soft despotism that Tocqueville warned us about centuries ago, a power that "is absolute, minute, regular, provident and mild." In his Liberties essay, Edmundson writes that this kind of power is now centerless. Presidents and executives don't run companies, universities or nations. Power is now held by everyone who issues work surveys and annual reports, the people who create H.R. trainings and collect data. He concludes: "They are using the terms of liberation to bring more and more free people closer to mental serfdom. Some day they will awaken in a cage of their own devising, so harshly confining that even they, drunk on their own virtue, will have to notice how their lives are the lives of snails tucked in their shells."
Trumpian populism is about many things, but one of them is this: working-class people rebelling against administrators. It is about people who want to lead lives of freedom, creativity and vitality, who find themselves working at jobs, sending their kids to schools and visiting hospitals, where they confront "an immense and tutelary power" (Tocqueville's words) that is out to diminish them.

How a Fishery Case Fits Into a Long-Game Effort to Sap Regulation of Business

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday in a set of cases that could pave the way for its conservative supermajority to undercut how American society imposes rules on businesses, advancing a key goal of the conservative legal movement.
Such a ruling would make it easier to challenge regulations across a gamut of issues — including keeping the air and water clean, ensuring that food, drugs, cars and consumer products are safe and much more.
The court is expected to issue its ruling by the end of its term, most likely in June. But it remains unclear how sweeping any ruling — and its consequences — would be. Here is a closer look:
What is at issue?
The plaintiffs in the case are asking the Supreme Court to overturn a major 1984 precedent, Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council. The decision lays out a framework that federal judges — especially at the district and appeals court levels — have used for decades to resolve the myriad legal challenges to regulations.
People who do not like particular rules can file lawsuits arguing that an agency exceeded the limits of the authority Congress granted to it. According to the precedent established in Chevron, if part of the law Congress wrote empowering a regulatory agency is ambiguous but the agency’s interpretation is reasonable, judges should defer to the agency.
In the cases argued Wednesday, owners of commercial fishing vessels are challenging a regulation issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service. It requires commercial fishers to pay the cost of monitors who prevent overfishing. An appeals court upheld the rule based on Chevron methodology, and the plaintiffs are asking the Supreme Court to reverse that — and to overturn Chevron.
Why is the case important?
Even though the question of who pays for fishery monitors mainly affects only a handful of commercial fishers, the principle the case establishes could profoundly influence how the government imposes rules on a range of businesses.
Critics of Chevron argue that the approach puts too much power in the hands of executive branch agencies and that courts are abdicating their authority to interpret the law. Proponents of it argue that without such a filter, courts will be micromanaging any number of exceedingly technical issues that judges have no expertise to resolve.
“If Chevron disappears,” said Jody Freeman, a Harvard University law professor who specializes in administrative and environmental law, it could become “a free-for-all for judges to dig into the nitty-gritty of everything agencies are doing” and “an invitation for interest-group lawyers to try to tie up the agencies in legal knots.”
Notably, the lawyers representing the commercial fishing business plaintiffs in Wednesday’s case are backed by petrochemicals billionaire Charles Koch. He and his brother, David Koch, who died in 2019, have for decades funded libertarian-minded conservative causes.
What are the possible outcomes in the case?
The controlling conservative bloc of the Supreme Court is widely believed to have taken the case with the intent of curtailing Chevron. But it is unclear how far the court would go, what the consequences would be or what regulations could be upended since there are any number of paths the justices could take.
At the modest end of the spectrum, the court could simply narrow Chevron’s reach. For example, it could say that an agency is not free to interpret ambiguous statutes unless Congress has signaled that it specifically gave that agency such discretion — for example, if a statute says the agency shall come up with a “reasonable” approach to accomplishing its mission.
At the aggressive end of the spectrum, the court could overturn Chevron entirely and bar judges from deferring to an agency’s interpretation of its statute under any circumstances.
How might the case affect environmental protections?
Overturning the Chevron doctrine could put dozens of existing environmental regulations on air, water and chemical pollution at risk — and it could profoundly weaken the federal government’s authority to impose new regulations to limit climate change and to ban the use of asbestos and other toxins, said experts in environmental law.
That would be a major victory for the fossil fuel lobby and other industry groups that have strategically sought to limit the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to regulate pollution under laws that direct the agency, when writing new rules, to require industries to use the “best available technologies” to reduce pollution.
The EPA is drafting a pair of major climate change rules on cars and power plants that are expected to be released this spring. Because the federal agency, rather than the law, specifies the technologies to be used, “these rules will now certainly be targets of lawsuits that could be strengthened by the overruling of Chevron,” said Michael B. Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University.
Still, he said: “Nothing would be automatically overturned. But it’s a very large new arrow in the quiver of lawyers trying to push back against environmental regulation.”
What about already decided cases?
Looming over the arguments Wednesday was what a ruling curbing or even overturning Chevron would mean for past cases that were decided using the doctrine.
While the Supreme Court has only rarely invoked Chevron, lower courts have relied on Chevron’s methodology thousands of times to uphold regulations by ruling that agencies’ views of ambiguous statutes were reasonable.
A lawyer for the plaintiffs, Roman Martinez, told the justices Wednesday that he did not believe overruling Chevron would be particularly disruptive because of the judicial principle of not reopening already settled legal issues. But Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar warned the justices that “endless litigation” would ensue.
“Litigants will come out of the woodwork seeking to open those decisions and contending that they didn’t actually address what they now say is the relevant question,” she predicted.
Where does the conservative legal movement fit in?
The Supreme Court’s conservative supermajority has been chipping away at the authority of the administrative state, which took its shape as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal. It is the primary way modern American society imposes rules on businesses: Congress creates agencies staffed by technical experts to study various types of problems and empowers them to issue legally binding regulations.
Such regulations are aimed at broadly helping society but can cut into the profits of individual business owners.
After the consumer safety and environmental movements in the 1960s, a backlash emerged from businesses, and critics argued that government functionaries who were not accountable to voters were issuing regulations whose costs outweighed their benefits. (Elected lawmakers who control agency budgets have a procedure to overturn specific regulations, and agencies are run by presidential appointees.)
Rolling back the regulatory state became a central ideological goal of the ensuing conservative legal movement. And since President Donald Trump consolidated a conservative supermajority by appointing justices who emerged from that movement, it has been moving to do so.
In June 2020, for example, the five Republican appointees then on the court struck down a law in which Congress had sought to protect the chief of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from being fired by a president without a good cause, such as misconduct. Since Trump’s third appointee joined the court, the majority has gone further.
In particular, in June 2022, the court expanded and entrenched what the conservatives call the “major questions doctrine,” under which judges can strike down regulations that have a significant effect if they believe Congress was not explicit enough in authorizing agencies to take such actions.
Against that backdrop, overturning or gutting Chevron appears most likely to be their next step.

Food Marketers Seek A Cravings Workaround: [Correction]

Full text: One day about 60 years ago, the comedian Bert Lahr put on a devil suit, held up a potato chip and uttered a phrase that would become a food-marketing milestone: "Betcha can't eat just one."
Positioning food as deliciously addictive, as Lay's did in its sly TV commercial, became advertising gold. In the decades that followed, Oreos and freezer waffles ("L'eggo my Eggo!") were portrayed as so irresistible that people fought over them. A popular stoner movie, "Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle," chronicled two friends' obsessions with fast-food sliders.
Craveability became such a selling point that Kellogg's went all in and named a chocolate-filled cereal Krave. High-end chefs weren't immune. Christina Tosi, known for the hyper-sweet desserts at her Milk Bar shops, named one of them Crack Pie.
But we're now in the Ozempic era. A class of new drugs that eliminate food cravings, as well as a fresh body of scientific studies, have focused attention on the connection between addiction and food. Ultra-processed foods, made with cheap industrial ingredients and potentially as addictive as tobacco or gambling, are emerging as a national concern.
What's a food marketer to do? Some who work in or study the nation's $ 1 trillion food industry describe the moment as not much more than a speed bump. Food companies are nimble at surfing the cultural waves and finding new ways to keep customers reaching for another helping.
Others say it's a watershed moment in how Americans eat, and will change how companies sell food.
"It's an existential threat to the food industry and certainly an existential threat to the processed food industry," said Marion Nestle, an emeritus professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University who has written extensively on food policy and science. "You've got all these things coming together in a way they've never come together before."
Back in the 1960s, when Lay's dared the nation to resist, "it didn't even occur to anybody that wanting more chips could be bad," said Steve Siegelman, a marketing creative director who has worked with the beef industry, Kikkoman and Häagen-Dazs.
Casting food as irresistible or craveable has already begun to fall out of favor, he said, but it remains perfectly acceptable as a business-to-business tactic. Hidden Valley Ranch, for example, uses the slogan "Give them the cup they crave" in its ads in restaurant trade publications.
Sheer overuse has started to sap the marketing power of craveability, said Mike Kostyo, a vice president of the food industry consulting company Menu Matters, whose clients include brands like Dunkin' and Del Monte Foods. But as an underlying concept, he said, it's not going away.
"It's so central to how we market so many foods," he said. "All that imagery of oozing cheese and the sound of the crunch."
Mr. Kostyo said several clients have asked him how worried they should be about the runaway popularity of drugs like semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy) and tirzepatide (in Mounjaro), which people credit with silencing what they describe as "food noise," or constant thoughts about eating. He tells them it's too early to say.
If selling the addictive nature of a snack stops working, he said, the industry will find something else that will.
Food companies ran into a similar challenge in the early 1990s, when fat was cast as the dietary demon. They responded with products like SnackWell's, a line of fat- and cholesterol-free cookies that was so popular it was often in short supply. Baked Lay's, with fewer calories and less fat than the original, mounted a $ 50 million ad campaign showing supermodels fishing or playing poker. The slogan: "You can eat like one of the boys, but still look like one of the girls." The commercials ended, of course, with Lay's time-tested tagline.
Michael Moss, a former New York Times reporter who has written two books explaining how some food companies use science, marketing and political influence to get consumers hooked on their products, doesn't expect drugs like Ozempic to make any difference.
"Getting us to lose control is part of their business plan," he said of the processed food industry. "I was chatting with an industry lobbyist who said Vitamin O scares us about as much as Michelle Obama's 'Let's Move' campaign" to get children to eat better and exercise more.
In its recent annual report on the food and beverage industry, the market research company Mintel posited that consumer demand for minimally processed food will grow, and suggested that manufacturers focus on the benefits of food processing, like extending freshness or promoting food safety.
The report also offered a strategy for selling products with no redeeming nutritional value: "Brands that produce highly, overly or ultra-processed food and drink products will need to remind consumers of the joy and comfort they get from these products."
But instead of telling consumers what a product can do for them, many marketers pore through social media to find out what they want, said Caitlin Reynolds, an executive vice president at the advertising firm Saatchi & Saatchi.
"It's like an unprompted focus group that runs 24/7," she said.
In 2021, Ms. Reynolds led a team that in created an award-winning ad campaign for Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers inspired by the shutdown phase of the pandemic, when people posted that they ate the snacks by the handful while working from home. The multiplatform campaign featured Boban Marjanovic, the N.B.A. player with the largest hands, holding as many of the crackers as he could.
Although Goldfish are a mainstay in homes with young children, the snack has become a top seller with teenagers who grew up eating them. "Gen Z loves nostalgia," Ms. Reynolds said.
And although brand integrity matters to members of Generation Z, according to Mr. Kostyo of Menu Matters, they don't have the same health focus as the Millennial generation, with its grain bowls and nut milks.
"With Gen Z we see a movement away from that," he said. "They love candy and Taco Bell and TikTok-y foods."
Strategies for selling food to Generation Z and it successor, Alpha, the oldest members of which are 14, rely less on one message repeated in traditional advertising and more on deft use of social media. They also include fun, outrageous collaborations between brands, like the Nacho Cheese Dorito-flavored liquor that the snack giant recently created with Empirical, a company started by alumni of the elite Copenhagen restaurant Noma.
Still, some companies are sticking with the old get-'em-hooked approach. In 2022, Taco Bell pioneered a subscription offer, in which $ 10 bought a taco a day for a month. In November, it added a subscription for nacho fries.
And last week -- because sometimes sheer irresistibility still works -- the company introduced a Cravings Value Menu.

In the Ozempic Age, Has ‘Craveable’ Lost Its Selling Power?

Full text: Enlarge this image.
One day about 60 years ago, comedian Bert Lahr put on a devil suit, held up a potato chip and uttered a phrase that would become a food-marketing milestone: “Betcha can’t eat just one.”
Positioning food as deliciously addictive, as Lay’s did in its sly TV commercial, became advertising gold. In the decades that followed, Oreos and freezer waffles (“L’eggo my Eggo!”) were portrayed as so irresistible that people fought over them. A popular stoner movie, “Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle,” chronicled two friends’ obsessions with fast-food sliders.
Craveability became such a selling point that Kellogg’s went all in and named a chocolate-filled cereal Krave. High-end chefs weren’t immune. Christina Tosi, known for the hyper-sweet desserts at her Milk Bar shops, named one of them Crack Pie.
But we’re now in the Ozempic era. A class of new drugs that eliminate food cravings, as well as a fresh body of scientific studies, have focused attention on the connection between addiction and food. Ultra-processed foods, made with cheap industrial ingredients and potentially as addictive as tobacco or gambling, are emerging as a national concern.
What’s a food marketer to do? Some who work in or study the nation’s $1 trillion food industry describe the moment as not much more than a speed bump. Food companies are nimble at surfing the cultural waves and finding new ways to keep customers reaching for another helping.
Others say it’s a watershed moment in how Americans eat, and will change how companies sell food.
“It’s an existential threat to the food industry and certainly an existential threat to the processed food industry,” said Marion Nestle, an emeritus professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University who has written extensively on food policy and science. “You’ve got all these things coming together in a way they’ve never come together before.”
Back in the 1960s, when Lay’s dared the nation to resist, “it didn’t even occur to anybody that wanting more chips could be bad,” said Steve Siegelman, an executive creative director at the marketing firm Ketchum who has worked with the beef industry, Kikkoman and Häagen-Dazs.
Casting food as irresistible or craveable has already begun to fall out of favor, he said, but it remains perfectly acceptable as a business-to-business tactic. Hidden Valley Ranch, for example, uses the slogan “Give them the cup they crave” in its ads in restaurant trade publications.
Sheer overuse has started to sap the marketing power of craveability, said Mike Kostyo, a vice president of the food industry consulting company Menu Matters, whose clients include brands like Dunkin’ and Del Monte Foods. But as an underlying concept, he said, it’s not going away.
“It’s so central to how we market so many foods,” he said. “All that imagery of oozing cheese and the sound of the crunch.”
Kostyo said several clients have asked him how worried they should be about the runaway popularity of drugs like semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy) and tirzepatide (in Mounjaro), which people credit with silencing what they describe as “food noise,” or constant thoughts about eating. He tells them it’s too early to say.
If selling the addictive nature of a snack stops working, he said, the industry will find something else that will.
Food companies ran into a similar challenge in the early 1990s, when fat was cast as the dietary demon. They responded with products like SnackWell’s, a line of fat- and cholesterol-free cookies that was so popular it was often in short supply. Baked Lay’s, with fewer calories and less fat than the original, mounted a $50 million ad campaign showing supermodels fishing or playing poker. The slogan: “You can eat like one of the boys, but still look like one of the girls.” The commercials ended, of course, with Lay’s time-tested tagline.
Michael Moss, a former New York Times reporter who has written two books explaining how some food companies use science, marketing and political influence to get consumers hooked on their products, doesn’t expect drugs like Ozempic to make any difference.
“Getting us to lose control is part of their business plan,” he said of the processed food industry. “I was chatting with an industry lobbyist who said Vitamin O scares us about as much as Michelle Obama’s ‘Let’s Move’ campaign” to get children to eat better and exercise more.
In its recent annual report on the food and beverage industry, market research company Mintel posited that consumer demand for minimally processed food will grow, and suggested that manufacturers focus on the benefits of food processing, like extending freshness or promoting food safety.
The report also offered a strategy for selling products with no redeeming nutritional value: “Brands that produce highly, overly or ultra-processed food and drink products will need to remind consumers of the joy and comfort they get from these products.”
But instead of telling consumers what a product can do for them, many marketers pore through social media to find out what they want, said Caitlin Reynolds, an executive vice president at the advertising firm Saatchi & Saatchi.
“It’s like an unprompted focus group that runs 24/7,” she said.
In 2021, Reynolds led a team that created an award-winning ad campaign for Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers inspired by the shutdown phase of the pandemic, when people posted that they ate the snacks by the handful while working from home. The multiplatform campaign featured Boban Marjanovic, the NBA player with the largest hands, holding as many of the crackers as he could.
Although Goldfish are a mainstay in homes with young children, the snack has become a top seller with teenagers who grew up eating them. “Gen Z loves nostalgia,” Reynolds said.
And although brand integrity matters to members of Generation Z, according to Kostyo of Menu Matters, they don’t have the same health focus as the millennial generation, with its grain bowls and nut milks.
“With Gen Z we see a movement away from that,” he said. “They love candy and Taco Bell and TikTok-y foods.”

Trading Southern Gothic for Arctic Horror: [Review]

Author: Hale, Mike

Abstract: None available.

Full text: HBO's eerie crime drama returns after a five-year break and trades in Southern gothic for Arctic horror.
"True Detective" was never a series that went in for tender moments, but "True Detective: Night Country" -- the show's fourth season, after a five-year hiatus -- takes a particularly unforgiving approach to the human condition. There is a moment late in the six-episode season, however, when the dour pop soundtrack turns sentimental and it's clear that we are supposed to be tenderly moved by what is happening. What is happening is that someone is disposing of the dismembered body of the close family member they have just killed.
Created for HBO back in 2014 by the writer and English professor Nic Pizzolatto, the original iteration of "True Detective" was a gothic crime drama, in anthology form, marked by Pizzolatto's penchant for ostensibly profound, quasi-poetic dialogue -- Raymond Chandler by way of Rod McKuen.
The new season, directed and largely written by the Mexican filmmaker Issa López (it premieres on Sunday), dispenses with the poetry -- it is by and large a plain-spoken affair. But where Pizzolatto's "True Detective" stories were essentially traditional noirs with a gloss of pop psychology and horror-movie sensationalism, López commits fully to the outré and the supernatural. Parricide? That's just coming up for air.
López is coy about whether the cops, scientists, mine workers and Indigenous Alaskans who populate her story are actually dealing with malevolent spirits, but she is profligate in her use of horror effects to jolt the audience and goose the plot. Unseen voices abound, and dead people are frequently seen. Polar bears loom in the darkness. Oranges mysteriously, repeatedly appear out of nowhere and roll under characters' feet. A group of men freeze together in a big jumble, naked and mid-scream, and have to be cut out of the ice and slowly thawed under bright lights. (Somewhere, "The Thing" is wondering why it didn't think of that.)
What caused the deaths of the frozen men is one of the cases at the center of "Night Country," the other being the brutal murder years before of a young Indigenous woman. Investigating the two cases, whose connection gradually becomes clear, are two cops who hate each other, not in a funny or bantering way but with heavy sincerity.
Jodie Foster plays Danvers, the abrasive police chief of the remote Alaska mining town where the story is set, and Kali Reis plays Navarro, a dogged state trooper. Both characters carry crippling baggage: family deaths; troubled loved ones; wartime terror; the disadvantages of being female and, in Navarro's case, Indigenous. On top of it all, they share a dark moment in their professional pasts, a secret that, like many things in the season, is frequently teased before being anticlimactically revealed.
And they are not alone in their dysfunction -- nearly everyone in "Night Country" is beat up or broken down, angry or embittered. The exceptions are the saps: the preternaturally kind bartender, Qavvik (Joel D. Montgrand), whom Navarro uses for sex, and the puppy-dog deputy, Pete Prior (Finn Bennett), whom Danvers sees as a surrogate son and mercilessly overworks. They both border on caricature -- men who are exceptional for being basically decent -- but Montgrand and Bennett make them believable and sympathetic. John Hawkes can't do the same for Prior's father, Hank, a casually corrupt cop eagerly waiting for his online fiancée to arrive from Vladivostok; he's a flat-out cartoon.
Arctic settings (the season was filmed in Iceland), shot with an emphasis on darkness and vast, empty landscapes, fit hand in glove with eerie horror motifs; close comparisons include John Carpenter's "The Thing" and the British series "Fortitude," a show that covers some of the same ground as "Night Country" but in a more diverting, less wearying fashion. López, with help from the cinematographer Florian Hoffmeister, deploys those elements in an atmospheric if convoluted mystery that looks and feels, for a couple of episodes, as if it might work its way to an interesting conclusion. But she can't keep it under control -- the mystery steadily dissolves into preposterousness, the characters sink into incoherence, and the horror isn't original or evocative enough to carry things on its own.
The one way in which the season can be said to succeed, if only on the strength of its convictions, is as a representation of cultural and economic depredation -- environmental damage from the mine is a factor in the mystery, and the story's resolution is better explained by issues and emotions than by evidence or character development.
That could make "Night Country" popular -- an exemplar of a growing genre you might call virtue-noir -- but it doesn't make it good. Pizzolatto's overwriting got oppressive, but out of its florid abundance actors like Matthew McConaughey, Taylor Kitsch and Mahershala Ali could fashion interesting characters. López doesn't give her performers much to play beyond attitudes and postures.
At the center of the busy but dreary proceedings in "Night Country" is Danvers, who is a kind of anti-character: a protagonist, and essentially a heroine, who is almost comically unpleasant and inconsiderate and is hated by nearly everyone onscreen. (She's a construct built for our current political climate, the just barely redeemable Karen.) Foster, against all odds, finds ways to make Danvers seem human and even uncovers glints of humor in her; how she does it is a bigger mystery than those men in the ice.

TSMC's Revenues Flat
But Beat Expectations
The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company reported largely flat fourth-quarter revenue on Wednesday, but that still beat both the company's and the market's expectations.
TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple and Nvidia, has benefited from a boom in artificial intelligence applications that has helped it weather the tapering off of pandemic-led demand.
Revenue in the final three months of last year came in at T $ 625.5 billion ( $ 20.10 billion), according to Reuters calculations, compared with $ 19.93 billion a year earlier. That beat TSMC's previous prediction for fourth-quarter revenue being in a range of $ 18.8 billion to $ 19.6 billion.
For December alone, TSMC reported that revenue fell 8.4 percent from a year earlier. It was also down 14.4 percent compared with the previous month.

Germany's SAP to Pay
$ 222 Million Over Bribery
The German software company SAP agreed to pay about $ 222 million to resolve two investigations into bribery schemes in seven countries, U.S. authorities said.
The Justice Department said SAP had entered a three-year deferred prosecution agreement to resolve criminal charges that it conspired to bribe government officials in Indonesia and South Africa in order to win business.
SAP also reached a related civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to address similar alleged bribery schemes in Azerbaijan, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi and Tanzania, as well as Indonesia and South Africa.
The company "has accepted responsibility for corrupt practices that hurt honest businesses engaging in global commerce," the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Jessica Aber, said in a statement.

What Reporting on Long Covid Taught Me: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic, when many people who are now still sick were first infected, the common wisdom was that the coronavirus either sent you to an intensive care unit or, more commonly, caused mild symptoms that resolved after two weeks. But when my sister-in-law got infected in March 2020, she was still burning with fever after three weeks, then six, then more. In this newspaper and elsewhere, young and formerly healthy people shared stories about surviving but not recovering. When I interviewed scientists and clinicians about these lingering symptoms in May, most expressed surprise. "That's unusual," one said.
It wasn't. By May 2020, affected patients had already formed support groups thousands strong, coined terms like long Covid and long-hauler and even conducted research on their own communities. Even that March, people with similar illnesses like myalgic encephalomyelitis (also known as chronic fatigue syndrome or M.E./C.F.S.) had warned that the new pathogen would trigger a wave of disability. They knew then what is clear now: People infected by Covid can be pummeled by months or years of debilitating symptoms, including extreme fatigue, cognitive impairment, chest pain, shortness of breath and postexertional malaise -- a state in which existing symptoms worsen after even minor physical or mental exertion.
I wrote about long Covid in June 2020. In the following days, I got more than 100 emails from people who thought they were going mad -- or had been told as much -- and felt validated to see their reality reflected. That story was the first of an octet; those responses were the vanguards of thousands more.
Long-haulers have told me that through those pieces, they better understood what was happening to them, found community and medical care, and felt the relief of recognition at a time when friends, family members and health care professionals brushed off their ordeal as imaginary. As a science writer, I have written about many topics throughout my career. None have affected me more than long Covid. None have more profoundly changed my view about what journalism can achieve and how it can do so.
Covering long Covid solidified my view that science is not the objective, neutral force it is often misconstrued as. It is instead a human endeavor, relentlessly buffeted by our culture, values and politics. As energy-depleting illnesses that disproportionately affect women, long Covid and M.E./C.F.S. are easily belittled by a sexist society that trivializes women's pain, and a capitalist one that values people according to their productivity. Societal dismissal leads to scientific neglect, and a lack of research becomes fodder for further skepticism. I understood these dynamics only after interviewing social scientists, disability scholars and patients themselves, whose voices are often absent or minimized in the media. Like the pandemic writ large, long Covid is not just a health problem. It is a social one, and must also be understood as such.
Dismissal and gaslighting -- you're just depressed, it's in your head -- are among the worst aspects of long Covid, and can be as crushing as the physical suffering. They're hard to fight because the symptoms can be so beyond the realm of everyday experience as to seem unbelievable, and because those same symptoms can sap energy and occlude mental acuity. Journalism, then, can be a conduit for empathy, putting words to the indescribable and clarifying the unfathomable for people too sick to do it themselves.
Many long-haulers have told me that they've used my work to finally get through to skeptical loved ones, employers and doctors -- a use that, naïvely, I didn't previously consider. I had always imagined that the testing ground for my writing was the minds of my readers, who would learn something new or perhaps even change what and how they think. But this one-step model is woefully incomplete because we are a social species. Journalism doesn't stop with first-generation readers but cascades through their networks. Done well, it can make those networks stronger.
After my most recent piece, which explained how severe the fatigue of long Covid and M.E./C.F.S. can be, one long-hauler told me that her sister said, "I did not understand how sick you really felt." Even healthy people started writing in: A 25-year-old reader who has spent her life watching her mother wrestling with M.E./C.F.S. said that until reading that piece, "I truly didn't get it (or maybe didn't believe her)." People who had been sick for years or even decades said it was the first time they had seen their lives accurately, fully and compassionately reflected in the press.
This is a damning indictment of my profession, my prepandemic self included. I am far from the only journalist covering this topic but clearly there aren't enough of us. How could so many people feel so thoroughly unrepresented by an industry that purports to give voice to the voiceless?
In covering conditions like long Covid and M.E./C.F.S., many journalistic norms and biases work against us. Our love of iconoclasts privileges the voices of skeptics, who can profess to be canceled by patient groups, over the voices of patients who are actually suffering. Our fondness for novelty leaves us prone to ignoring chronic conditions that are, by definition, not new. Normalized aspects of our work like tight deadlines and phone interviews can be harmful to the people we most need to hear from.
We cannot afford those weaknesses. Around the world, tens of millions of people are suffering from long Covid. Some might recover but most long-haulers don't fully return to their previous base line. At the same time, the pool of newly sick people will continue to grow since our leaders have rushed us back to an era of unrestrained airborne pathogens and lax public health policies -- an era that had already cost millions of M.E./C.F.S. sufferers dearly long before Covid arrived.
In this status quo, people are expected to ignore the threat of infection, pay through the nose if they get sick and face stigma and ridicule if they become disabled. Journalism can and should repudiate that bargain. We are not neutral actors, reporting on the world at a remove; we also create that world through our choices, and we must do so with purpose, care and compassion.
Interviewing long-haulers isn't benign. At minimum, I might be asking them to relive their worst experiences to a stranger. Worse, many, if not most, long-haulers experience postexertional malaise, in which minor physical or mental exertion can trigger a loss of energy so profound that I've described it as the annihilation of possibility. An hourlong call could wreck someone for days.
Knowing this, I started telling people upfront that they could end and reschedule the interview at the slightest inkling that their health might suffer -- and some did pull that rip cord. I set long deadlines, knowing that I was working on what disability scholars have called crip time. While I usually insist that phone interviews yield better results, I happily sent written questions to long-haulers who struggled with real-time spoken conversations. Good journalists maintain a healthy distance from their sources, but this professional standard can morph into callousness: Staying independent can easily become, "I behave how I want and you deal with it." With long Covid, I bend to accommodate my sources' needs, not the other way around.
I bring as much curiosity and empathy as I can to interviews. I'm not fishing for quotes or dramatic details of horrible symptoms. I want to know how long-haulers feel, including the nuances and minutiae of their lives. I check my own thoughts on the fly, running my interpretations past my sources in real time to check if my understanding and assumptions are correct. I do this iteratively, asking them if they have had the same or similar experiences of the previous sources I've interviewed, to identify points of commonality or contention; everyone is wrong about something, and being empathetic doesn't mean abandoning rigor.
This approach reveals sides to the illness that are easily missed. For many long-haulers, fatigue differs from everyday tiredness -- more severe, multifaceted, harder to push through and not cured by sleep. Postexertional malaise is different again: Every symptom burns more fiercely; fatigue is accompanied by flulike, poisoned sensations; and one's batteries aren't just drained but missing entirely. These states are all too easily conflated, and their differences became clear to me only after many interviews and much careful listening.
I also center long-haulers in my reporting, treating them as active protagonists of their own stories instead of passive beneficiaries of medical aid. I want readers to empathize, not gawk. The patient-centric approach is sometimes dismissed as advocacy, which is positioned as antithetical to journalism. In fact, it's simply good journalistic practice to give weight to the most knowledgeable sources.
Long-haulers saw and predicted the rise of long Covid before credentialed academics did. Many are patient experts who have read the scientific literature on long Covid and M.E./C.F.S. more deeply than many doctors because they are highly motivated to do so. Others are meta-experts who thoroughly understand the community's desires, needs, history and rifts, and can distinguish reliable voices from grifters. They should be front and center of every story, not merely fodder for anecdotal ledes. Before the pandemic, I mostly interviewed academics with advanced degrees and institutional affiliations. Long Covid taught me to also seek expertise from actual experience, instead of mere credentials. (This is now especially easy to do because large databases of sources have been compiled.)
Those new attitudes and approaches also informed other articles that I wrote about immunocompromised people, burned-out health care and public health workers and people grieving loved ones who died of Covid. Those pieces, about people who had borne the brunt of the pandemic and were still suffering amid the rush to "normal," gave me a sense of purpose amid deepening tragedy.
As the pandemic wore on, many grim outcomes I warned about came to pass, and most societal changes I hoped for did not. I watched two successive administrations make avoidable mistakes, and then make them anew with each successive surge or variant. I witnessed almost every publication that I once held in esteem become complicit in normalizing a level of death once billed as incalculable. It was galling, crushing work that wrecked my faith in journalism and its institutions. But the solace that many long-haulers drew from my pieces gave me solace in turn. It convinced me that there is still a point to this horrible work, a purpose in bearing witness to suffering and a reason to continue shouting into the abyss. Sometimes, even if just slightly, the abyss brightens.
I do not mean to be self-congratulatory. The long Covid crisis is far from resolved. Long-haulers need more than confirmation of their pain: They need well-funded and well-conducted research, social support, workplace accommodations and cures. But there is much we can do while waiting for and pushing toward those outcomes.
In his poem "Why Bother?" Sean Thomas Dougherty wrote, "Because right now, there is someone/out there with/a wound in the exact shape/of your words." Those words are ours to provide, those wounds ours to plaster. Contrary to the widespread notion that speaking truth to power means being antagonistic and cold, journalists can, instead, act as a care-taking profession -- one that soothes and nurtures. And we are among the only professions that can do so at a scale commensurate with the scope of the crises before us. We can make people who feel invisible feel seen. We can make everyone else look.

Full text: As the world warms, the state is re-examining claims to its water that have gone unchallenged for generations.
Raymond Zhong , a climate reporter, traveled up and down California to get inside the state's water battles. Data analysis by Mira Rojanasakul .
The story of California's water wars begins, as so many stories do in the Golden State, with gold.
The prospectors who raced westward after 1848 scoured fortunes out of mountainsides using water whisked, manically and in giant quantities, out of rivers. To impose some order on the chaos, the newcomers embedded in the state's emerging water laws a cherished frontier principle: first come first served. The only requirement for holding on to this privileged status was to keep putting the water to work. In short, use it or lose it.
Their water rights assured, the settlers gobbled up land, laid down dams, ditches, communities. Shrewd barons turned huge estates into jackpots of grain, cattle, vegetables and citrus. California grew and grew and grew, sprouting new engines of wealth along the way: oil, Hollywood, Apple, A.I.
Yet, still today the state is at the mercy of claims to water that were staked more than a century ago, in that cooler, less crowded world. As drought and overuse sap the state's streams and aquifers, California finds itself haunted by promises, made to generations of farmers and ranchers, of priority access to the West's most precious resource, with scant oversight, essentially forever.
For many beloved products -- nuts and grapes, milk and lettuce -- America depends heavily on California. Its farms produce billions of dollars more each year than those in Texas, Nebraska and other states far more defined by agriculture. Water sustains jobs and livelihoods across the state's economy, which outranks those of all but a handful of nations. Yet in no state does rainfall vary more each year, swinging between deluge and drought in a cycle that global warming is intensifying at both ends.
With so many people, plants and animals competing for this fickle bounty, water fights have shaped California at every stage of development, all the way back to its infancy as a state, when its abundance seemed limitless and settlers took it as their duty to commandeer it. Now, Californians are being forced to confront the limitations of nature's endowment in new and urgent ways.
And so, to address this most 21st century of crises, a state that prides itself on creating the future is first reckoning with its past.
In the Central Valley, home to some of the nation's most productive cropland, officials are taking a hard new look at water rights that date back to the 19th century. They are asking farmers to provide historical records to back their claims and using satellite data to size up who is taking river water and how much. A Times analysis of state data identified many growers who reported their use in questionable ways.
In California's rugged north, regulators are considering throttling supplies to cattle ranchers and other users who for decades have been siphoning too much from the streams, at times in open disregard of the law, worsening a collapse in salmon populations.
And in desert highlands of the Central Coast, the state's efforts to stop groundwater depletion have spurred two of the world's largest carrot growers to sue all of their neighboring landowners, big and small, so they can keep pumping.
California has been regulating river flows, however imperfectly, for more than a century. But it didn't even begin restricting groundwater extraction in a major way until a mere decade ago. Farmers in many areas must now figure out how to stay in business by using less groundwater themselves -- or by ensuring their neighbors do.
"The reality is that California had a pretty soft touch in water rights administration" compared with many Western states, said E. Joaquin Esquivel, the chair of the state's water board, California's main regulator. "The system worked for as long as it really could."
Climate change is only deepening the strains on the state's rivers, which are essential to cities and farms alike. In dry years, less snow is piling up in the mountains to feed them. And more of what does flow downriver ends up evaporating, soaking into parched topsoil or being pulled into the ground as farmers pump out the aquifers.
How California manages could have ramifications well beyond occasional curbs on watering lawns. In the San Joaquin Valley, the Central Valley's enormous southern half, researchers estimate that more than half a million acres of farmland may need to be taken out of cultivation by 2040 to stabilize the region's aquifers.
California is hardly the only place where people are reconciling with choices made generations ago about land, water and other shared resources. A Times data investigation this year found groundwater in distress nationwide and exposed a broad failure to address exploitation or even reliably track water use. Yet, few places have wrested such immense riches out of their natural inheritance as California has. New choices about how to share that inheritance might not be able to avoid cutting into one pot of riches or another.
"We can't fix it without stepping on toes," said David Webb, who has worked for decades to protect the Shasta River in California's far north, one of many overworked streams statewide. Come summertime, it's not unheard of that ranches and farms all but drain the Shasta to a trickle.
Fixing 'use it or lose it'
Nowhere do the strands of California water history get tangled into trickier knots than in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, the vast fertile estuary where the main rivers that nourish the Central Valley pour into the San Francisco Bay, then out to sea.
Mr. Esquivel, the water board's chair, called the Delta "our most wicked of problems."
The heart of it is that many of the area's farms and irrigation districts have been drawing from the Delta's braided channels for well over a century, before the state even had a water board. This gives them extraordinary privilege in California's seniority-based system: When there isn't enough water to go around, they get first dibs. And for a long time, a lot of them didn't have to provide the state with many details about how much water they actually used.
That is starting to change. Not only is the water board demanding more information from growers on their use, but it's also starting this year to use satellite analysis that estimates how much evaporates from their fields, a powerful check on farmers' claims.
All of this is helping the state form a clearer picture of where water goes in the Delta.
Yet growers' self-reported numbers still contain peculiarities, suggesting that many are probably submitting ballpark estimates rather than precise measurements. The Times analyzed state data from 2010 to 2022 and found that monthly use reports associated with about a quarter of Delta water rights contained a significant share of duplicates -- identical numbers, over and over, for months. Sometimes years.
Another issue: Many Delta growers claim not just one water right, but several. California's use-it-or-lose-it system provides an incentive for them to report using more water than they actually do, or even to count the same use under more than one claimed water right.
Faulty or misleading data can have far-reaching consequences during drought. If lots of growers are double-counting their use, then officials may think less water is available for everybody else than there actually is.
David Weisenberger, the general manager of the Banta-Carbona Irrigation District, which claims rights on the San Joaquin River that date back to 1911, said he double-reported the district's use for years to avoid losing its water rights.
Recently, he began providing more accurate accounting after the water board's lawyers assured him that he wouldn't be forfeiting the district's rights by doing so. But part of him still worries about future cuts.
"Who knows what they'll do?" he said on a recent bright morning, driving past neat rows of grapes in his district's patch of the Delta.
Mr. Weisenberger's father grew beans and grain in the Central Valley. His grandfather raised cattle. Water disputes used to be handled locally, he said. If someone didn't think they were getting their rightful share, they would go talk to whoever might be taking too much upriver. Maybe they'd sue.
Neighbors held neighbors accountable, Mr. Weisenberger said, so state officials had no need to know how much water everybody was taking. Today, though, "they're headed in the direction of 'God squad' -- they know better than anybody," he said.
Already in California's most recent droughts, the board has used new data and analysis techniques to justify deploying aggressive emergency orders to stop thousands of growers in the Delta watershed from taking water. "Emergency regulations don't leave any room for due process," Ed Zuckerman, a third-generation Delta farmer, said. "We will fight it to our last breath."
So far, though, it isn't the Delta where the board's efforts have prompted the fiercest complaints. Or the most blatant defiance.
The battle of cattle and salmon
Follow the Sacramento River 200 miles upstream, past its headwaters in the shadow of Mount Shasta, and you start to feel about as far from California's coastal centers of influence as you would on Mars.
Morning mists hover in the pine-perfumed air. Cattle graze on lush mountain meadows. This is a proudly independent-minded corner of the state, with an on-again, off-again history of trying to secede from it.
It's here that the water board this year began contemplating a quietly explosive policy: To protect the imperiled salmon that spawn in the Scott and Shasta Rivers, it is considering permanently limiting ranchers' access to the streams, effectively circumscribing their long-established water rights. The board has done this in both rivers during California's latest droughts. Now it might restrict their use for good, drought or no drought.
For decades, ranches and farms have been slurping the Shasta and Scott down to small fractions of their natural flows in dry years. Migrations of Chinook and coho salmon have plummeted, harming the Native American communities whose diet and culture center on the fish.
The problem received a burst of fresh attention in the severely dry summer of 2022, when some ranchers in the Shasta Valley flouted state orders to limit water use. To save their herds, they turned on their pumps. The river's flows quickly dropped by more than half.
For eight days, this continued. And the water board was powerless to do anything but impose its largest possible punishment: a fine of $ 500 per day of illegal diversion, split between the 80 or so scofflaws. In other words, $ 50 each, a paltry price to pay.
In response, state lawmakers have put forth a bill that would increase penalties to $ 10,000 a day.
Mr. Esquivel, the water board's chair, called stronger salmon protections "long overdue." When it comes to the state's treatment of the Karuk, Yurok and other tribes, "there's a history that has to be acknowledged," he said.
Economic development has transformed California's northernmost landscapes in great waves. Fur trappers decimated the beavers. Loggers sawed through old-growth forests. Miners dredged the Scott River in pursuit of gold, creating a 600-acre gravel moonscape that remains to this day.
All throughout, salmon have paid a price. In the 1930s, as many as 82,000 Chinook migrated up the Shasta each fall. Last year, only 4,500 made the trip.
"Our religion was salmon," said Kenneth Brink, the vice chair of the Karuk tribal council. "When the salmon went away, the people went away, the ceremonies went away."
Ranchers, for their part, see a parallel threat in water restrictions. One directed at their way of life, rather than the tribes'.
Leaving so much water in the rivers would mean "immediate lights out" for agriculture, said Theodora Johnson, who raises cattle in the Scott Valley. "My kids are seventh generation here," she said. "I have to do everything I can to try to save it."
Antiquated, unsearchable records
To understand one reason California struggles so mightily to track its water, you might visit a small room in Sacramento that is jam-packed with some of the state's most valuable mysteries.
There are documents written in the ornate cursive of bygone times. Corduroy-bound ledgers. Maps whose labels have come unglued. Sepia photos of charmingly unphotogenic subjects: dirt fields, pear orchards, wooden sluices.
These are the water board's records of every water right it has handed out since the early 20th century. Millions of musty files, smelling of history. And they are unwieldy, unsearchable -- a mess.
Starting next month, all of this forgotten paper will, for the first time, be scanned and made accessible online to help resolve water disputes and better parcel out supplies during droughts. But soon, the board could go even further, demanding more information from farmers who hold the state's oldest water claims, those dating back to the pioneer era.
In October, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law giving the board express authority to investigate whether these users have valid rights and, if so, are using them appropriately -- a prospect that has rankled farmers up and down the state.
In the Central Valley, "you've got so many water-rights holders who believe their water rights are whatever their granddaddy said they were," said Felicia Marcus, a visiting fellow at Stanford and former chair of the water board.
At the moment, the board's records on California's senior-most water users are sparse. Deeds, maps and notices might well exist that would tell regulators more about the origins of longstanding claims. But many of those documents have spent the past century or more hidden away in libraries and courthouses, or locked up at farms and irrigation districts.
The water board is hoping to bring more of them out of the shadows.
No other state has "this arbitrary thing that says that you can't even ask basic questions about the validity of a right" just because it's old, said State Senator Ben Allen, who proposed the bill that the governor recently signed.
The water board will "start small" with its new powers, said Erik Ekdahl, its deputy director in charge of water rights. It will first ask growers to update records and data here or there. As Mr. Ekdahl put it, the board might ask things like: "Hey, can you go in and update your place-of-use map? Because right now the one we have is literally a bunch of 3-by-5 pictures that you've taken and drawn on with a Sharpie, and we can't actually make heads or tails of it."
Eventually, though, the board might start digging deeper. And that has farmers on edge.
That's because files that might help validate someone's 19th-century water claim might already be lost to time, said John Herrick, a lawyer who represents growers in the Delta. "You have to find somebody's journal that said, 'I got up today on Aug. 21 in 1890 and opened the sluice gate,"' he said. "Jesus! That doesn't exist."
Baby carrots, big conflict
In a sun-scorched pocket of desert between the Sierra Madre Mountains and the Caliente Range, there is a length of Highway 166 flanked each summer by rows of lacy, bright-green stalks. These are the carrots of the Cuyama Valley, many destined to be clipped and shaved into those quintessential emblems of American supermarket ingenuity: baby carrots.
Of late, these carrots have become an emblem of something else, too: the state's painful groundwater crisis.
About a decade ago -- and, arguably, decades too late -- California legislators finally did something about the fact that many of the state's vital aquifers were being pumped dry beneath their feet. They passed a law, the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, to end overuse and depletion.
Seen one way, the law is remarkably optimistic. Its premise is that neighbors will be neighborly: Instead of issuing top-down orders on how to conserve, the law leaves it up to local groups to work it out among themselves.
But in retrospect, this may have overestimated Californians' neighborliness when water is at stake.
In Cuyama, the corporate owners of the carrot fields are suing every other landowner in the valley: farms, vineyards, ranches, even the tiny school district. Their aim, effectively, is to make their neighbors share more of the burden of reducing water use under Cuyama's sustainability plan. The case goes to trial next month.
"They know that their water table has gone down," said Jim Wegis, who grows olives and pistachios nearby and is a defendant in the case. "It keeps going down. And they want us to help support their habit."
Daniel T. Clifford, the general counsel for Bolthouse Properties, one of the plaintiffs, said the valley's groundwater plan had left the companies no choice but to sue. The plan calls for total pumping to be cut by half to two-thirds over the next 15 years. So far, though, it is imposing those cuts only in the area of the valley that is dominated by Bolthouse and the other carrot giant, Grimmway.
"That's not fair or consistent with California water law," said Robert G. Kuhs, a lawyer representing the other plaintiffs, the owners of the land that Grimmway farms. "We strive to be good neighbors."
In their section of the valley, the two carrot growers have used more water in recent decades than everyone else combined. Groundwater levels there are projected to fall by as much as seven feet a year, compared with two feet or less in other areas.
Others in Cuyama suspect that the carrot companies are trying to make as much money as they can in the valley before water restrictions make growing unviable and they move their operations someplace else.
Mr. Clifford, the Bolthouse Properties lawyer, said the carrot growers would always need to farm in Cuyama. The reason, he said, is all of us, the carrot-eating public.
"The American consumer has grown to absolutely rely" on being able to buy carrots 365 days a year, Mr. Clifford said. The high elevation of the Cuyama Valley makes it possible to produce them when it's too hot to do so elsewhere. "They want that carrot year-round," he said.
On this at least, he and Mr. Wegis, one of the neighboring growers his company is suing, can agree. Except that Mr. Wegis sees it as part of the problem.
"We as farmers have spoiled the public," Mr. Wegis said. "Everybody's used to going into the store and seeing everything they want, all the time."
Analysis of self-reported water use estimates in the Delta was based on State Water Resources Control Board data from 2010 to 2022. Any reported water use amount repeated more than once was counted as a duplicate, except for values of 0 or 1 acre-foot. In past guidance to Delta water users for avoiding double-counting of usage under multiple water rights, the state board has suggested recording 1 acre-foot as a placeholder. If 25 percent or more of the monthly use values associated with a given water right were duplicates, then that water right was counted as having a "significant" share of them.

For eight days, this continued. And the water board was powerless to do anything but impose its largest possible punishment: a fine of $500 per day of illegal diversion, split among the 80 or so scofflaws.
In response, state lawmakers have put forth a bill that would increase penalties to $10,000 a day.
One reason California struggles so mightily to track its water can been found in a small room in Sacramento that is jam-packed with some of the state’s most valuable mysteries — documents written in the ornate cursive of bygone times, corduroy-bound ledgers, maps whose labels have come unglued.
These are the water board’s records of every water right it has handed out since the early 20th century. They are unwieldy, unsearchable — a mess.
But starting next month, all of this forgotten paper will, for the first time, be scanned and made accessible online to help resolve water disputes and better parcel out supplies during droughts. Soon, the board could go even further, demanding more information from farmers who hold the state’s oldest water claims.
In October, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law giving the board express authority to investigate whether these users have valid rights and, if so, are using them appropriately.
At the moment, the board’s records on California’s senior-most water users are sparse. Deeds, maps and notices might well exist that would tell regulators more about the origins of long-standing claims. But many of those documents have spent the past century or more hidden away in libraries and courthouses or locked up at farms and irrigation districts.
The water board is hoping to bring more of them out of the shadows.
About a decade ago — and, arguably, decades too late — California legislators finally did something about the fact that many of the state’s vital aquifers were being pumped dry beneath their feet. They passed a law, the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, to end overuse and depletion.
Its premise is that neighbors will be neighborly: Instead of issuing top-down orders on how to conserve, the law leaves it up to local groups to work it out among themselves.
In retrospect, this may have overestimated Californians’ neighborliness when water is at stake.
In Cuyama Valley, where baby carrots are grown, the corporate owners of the carrot fields are suing every other landowner in the valley: farms, vineyards, ranches, even the tiny school district. Their aim, effectively, is to make their neighbors share more of the burden of reducing water use under Cuyama’s sustainability plan. The case goes to trial next month.
“They know that their water table has gone down,” said Jim Wegis, who grows olives and pistachios nearby and is a defendant in the case. “And they want us to help support their habit.”
Daniel Clifford, the general counsel for Bolthouse Properties, one of the plaintiffs, said the valley’s groundwater plan had left the companies no choice but to sue. The plan calls for total pumping to be cut by half to two-thirds over the next 15 years. So far, though, it is imposing those cuts only in the area of the valley that is dominated by Bolthouse and the other carrot giant, Grimmway.
“That’s not fair or consistent with California water law,” said Robert Kuhs, a lawyer representing the other plaintiffs, the owners of the land that Grimmway farms.
In their section of the valley, the two carrot growers have used more water in recent decades than everyone else combined. Groundwater levels there are projected to fall by as much as 7 feet a year, compared with 2 feet or less in other areas.
“The American consumer has grown to absolutely rely” on being able to buy carrots 365 days a year, Clifford said.
“We as farmers have spoiled the public,” Wegis said. “Everybody’s used to going into the store and seeing everything they want, all the time.”

Full text: A trio of antitrust cases on the docket threaten to reshape Google's business and sap its profits.
Google's loss was swift after a monthlong antitrust trial in a San Francisco federal court. A little more than three hours after a jury had begun deliberating on Monday, they returned with their verdict.
There were 11 antitrust claims that Epic Games, the maker of the hit videogame Fortnite, had brought against Google's Play Store for Android mobile devices, and the jury found Google to be at fault in every one of them.
It was the first test of how Google might fare in the antitrust gauntlet it faces in the United States -- and the company was routed. The courtroom loss could portend Google's legal fate in two, more significant antitrust cases in the United States that could weaken the world's most influential internet business and reshape the tech industry for years to come.
Google will learn more about the direction the cases will take next year. In San Francisco, Judge James Donato of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California will decide early in the year how Google should be punished for what the jury found to be anticompetitive conduct with its app store.
Google and the Justice Department are expected to make closing arguments in May in a separate antitrust trial in Washington D.C., that focused on Google's overwhelmingly popular search engine. And the company still faces another antitrust trial, regarding its online ad business, in a federal court in Virginia.
By the end of 2024, Google could be staring down significant changes to how it operates, and years of appeals in courtrooms around the country.
"It's a period of massive uncertainty for Google, where they're not sure what their business practices are going to look like in two or three years," Sam Weinstein, a former Justice Department antitrust lawyer who is now a professor at the Cardozo School of Law, said in an interview.
The cases are part of a broader regulatory backlash against large technology companies, from regulators and lawmakers around the world who believe the giants have too much power over commerce, politics and daily life. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, already seized on Monday's verdict to boost her legislative efforts to rein in Big Tech.
"We must take the next step in Congress to finally update our consumer laws for the digital age," she said in a statement.
Google plans to appeal the verdict and will "continue to defend the Android business model," Wilson White, a Google vice president of government affairs, said in a statement. He added that the trial had "made clear that we compete fiercely with Apple and its App Store, as well as app stores on Android devices and gaming consoles."
Here is a rundown of the antitrust lawsuits facing Google:
The Play Store Case
The nine-person federal jury in San Francisco found that Google had undermined competition in the mobile-app ecosystem in three key ways: by monopolizing two markets, its Play Store and mobile billing system; imposing unreasonable restraints of trade on players in those markets; and tying together the two offerings so other businesses had to use both of them.
Google and Epic will return to court in the second week of January to lay out their cases for what changes Google should be forced to make to improve competition on the Play Store. Though Google has already vowed to appeal the decision, Mr. Weinstein said it was likely that Judge Donato would look to open up the app store, potentially giving Android users more choices in how to download and pay for apps.
The Search Case
Google's trial with the Justice Department and dozens of states over its search engine and search advertising practices took place mostly in the fall, but closing arguments are scheduled for the beginning of May.
The case focused on whether Google unfairly used its clout and billions of dollars to give its search engine an unfair advantage over far less popular competitors. Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, who will render a verdict, said at the end of the trial that he had no idea how he was going to rule in the case.
If Judge Mehta sides with the Justice Department, the government could ask for a range of remedies, including offering consumers an easier way to decide which search engine they would like to use and calling for Google's search distribution platforms, such as the Chrome web browser or Android operating system, to be spun off from the company.
The Ad-Tech Case
A federal judge in Virginia is considering a separate Justice Department lawsuit accusing Google of illegally abusing its power over the technology that delivers ads online.
Google makes tools that publishers use to sell ads on their websites, ones that marketers use to place ads and digital auction systems that act as intermediaries between both parties.
The Justice Department has argued that Google should be forced to divest this display-ad business. A trial in the case could begin as soon as next year..
The European Cases
The European Commission in June charged Google with violating antitrust laws by using its dominance in online advertising to undercut rivals, echoing the case in Virginia. The European authorities have already fined Google more than 8 billion euros, or $ 8.6 billion, over what they say are antitrust violations related to its Android mobile operating system, shopping service and another advertising business. All those cases are waiting on appeals from Google.

Russia Exploits Celebrities in Ukraine War: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Videos from Elijah Wood, Mike Tyson and others have been used -- unknowingly to them, it seems -- in social media posts and Russian news coverage critical of Ukraine's leader.
The Kremlin has unleashed a new weapon in its information war with the West: the fake celebrity cameo.
"Hi, Vladimir, Elijah here," the actor Elijah Wood said in a video packaged to seem as if Mr. Wood were addressing Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky. The actor, best known for playing Frodo Baggins in "Lord of the Rings," urged the president to enter treatment for drug and alcohol abuse. "I hope you can get the help you need," Mr. Wood signed off.
The video was recorded on Cameo, the popular, though now struggling, app where users can pay for personalized messages from famous people -- in Mr. Wood's case, starting at $ 340. While a genuine video, it was repurposed as part of Russia's efforts to falsely denigrate Mr. Zelensky as a drug-addled neo-Nazi. Beginning in July, according to a report released on Thursday by Microsoft's Threat Analysis Center, the video and others like it ricocheted through Russian social media and were ultimately featured by news organizations owned or controlled by the government.
Other celebrities used in the videos -- all unknowingly, it seems -- included Shavo Odadjian, the musician and producer, and the actors John McGinley, Dean Norris, Priscilla Presley and Kate Flannery. Mike Tyson, the former heavyweight champion boxer, appears in a video taken from his own promotional page on Cameo. It was repurposed without any recording of his voice, though a voice-over intones a similar plea to Mr. Zelensky.
Ms. Flannery, known for her role in the television comedy series "The Office," teasingly holds up a bottle of whiskey before turning serious in her message. "Seriously, it will be wonderful," she says. "Just do it."
The campaign was one of a flurry in recent weeks intended to build support for the war at home in Russia while stoking opposition to it abroad.
"Russian cyber and influence operators have demonstrated adaptability throughout the war on Ukraine, trying new ways to gain battlefield advantage and sap Kyiv's sources of domestic and external support," Microsoft wrote in its report, referring to Ukraine's capital.
Cameo said in a statement that videos like this would violate the company's community guidelines. "In cases where such violations are substantiated, Cameo will typically take steps to remove the problematic content and suspend the purchaser's account to help prevent further issues," the statement said.
The celebrities used in the videos did not respond to requests for comment, but a representative for Mr. Wood said that while the actor had recorded the message on Cameo, it was "in no way intended to be addressed to Zelensky or have anything at all to do with Russia or Ukraine or the war."
The novelty of exploiting commercially available cameos underlines the ingenuity -- and persistence -- of Russia's efforts to try to justify its war in Ukraine. Although Microsoft's researchers did not establish the exact source of the videos, experts who reviewed the findings said the campaign bore the hallmarks of previous covert information operations from Russia.
A separate campaign began last month with posts on Facebook and the social media platform X. The posts included photographs of more than 75 global celebrities -- including Oprah Winfrey and the Portuguese soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo -- with block quotes echoing key Kremlin propaganda messages, according to Antibot4navalny, a prominent group of anonymous volunteers who have exposed Russian trolling efforts online.
"I know the U.S.A. blew up the Nord Streams," said a post accompanied by a photograph of Beyoncé, referring to the underwater gas pipelines destroyed in the Baltic Sea in September 2022. "Does anyone seriously think otherwise?" The same phrases appeared in a post with a picture of the billionaire businessman Richard Branson.
In fact, American and European intelligence agencies have evidence suggesting that Ukrainian intelligence operatives carried out the pipeline attack, though no conclusive case has been made public.
The group of anonymous volunteers, whose name refers to Aleksei A. Navalny, the jailed Russian opposition leader, attributed the campaign to a coordinated information operation called Doppelgänger. Since 2017, Doppelgänger has been linked to numerous other efforts, including the creation of fake websites impersonating actual news organizations in Europe and the United States.
The group's researchers and others say Russia's latest efforts have been bolstered by artificial intelligence, which experts have warned could speed the production and dissemination of disinformation.
The Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a research organization in London that tracks extremism online, reported on Tuesday that it had uncovered a network of 64 bot accounts on X that appeared to be using content generated by the A.I. chatbot ChatGPT to criticize Mr. Navalny and his organization, the Anti-Corruption Foundation.
Although the content had some quirks and oddities, including one reply on X that included ChatGPT's disclaimer against hate speech or harassment, the institute's report said the capabilities of A.I. tools made it increasingly difficult to distinguish between content that was generated artificially and content created by humans.
"For most people scrolling casually through a platform like X, the content could easily pass as authentic," the report said.
The cameo videos had the benefit of being real recordings. They first appeared on social media accounts in Russia, including Telegram and VKontakte, whose content hews closely to Kremlin views. Almost all were in Russian, suggesting the intended audience of the campaign was domestic. One post with Ms. Flannery's message had more than 11,000 likes.
The posts were then amplified by Tsargrad, a media network owned by Konstantin Malofeyev, a conservative businessman who has been under sanctions by the United States since 2014 for his support of Russia's initial invasion of Crimea and eastern Ukraine at that time.
Articles about the videos later appeared in prominent Russian news organizations, including the state news wire, RIA Novosti, and the official government newspaper, Rossiyskaya Gazeta.
"The internet has repeatedly noticed the strange behavior of Volodymyr Zelensky in public and during his video messages, often linking this with drug addiction," RIA Novosti wrote in August. The article included a footnote warning that Facebook and Instagram, both owned by Meta, are banned in Russia as extremist.

Attack by Kyiv Cuts Power To Some Occupied Areas: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The assault on energy infrastructure, a significant theater in the war, followed a large-scale Russian drone attack on Kyiv.
A Ukrainian strike on a power station in Russian-held territory in eastern Ukraine overnight cut power to towns and cities, the pro-Russian authorities there said on Sunday, less than a day after Moscow launched a record number of attack drones toward Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital.
The overnight attack was another sign of Kyiv's determination to inflict damage on its adversary's electricity infrastructure before what many in Ukraine expect will be a renewed wintertime assault by Russia on Ukraine's power grid.
Denis Pushilin, the pro-Moscow leader in the Russian-held part of the Donetsk region, said that most of the drones launched by Ukraine at the area overnight had been intercepted, but "due to the massiveness of the strikes, not everything was shot down."
"The situation is not easy," he said on the Telegram messaging app, adding that some towns and districts had been left without light. He did not say whether the attack had involved drones or missiles or a combination of the two.
The attack hit the thermal power plant in Starobesheve, a town at least 25 miles east of the front line in the region, according to Russia's RIA Novosti state news agency. It said that power had been cut in half of the regional capital, Donetsk, and in half of the port city of Mariupol about 60 miles to the south.
Power infrastructure has become a significant theater in the war, in addition to the frontline battles in southern and eastern Ukraine and a struggle for control of the Black Sea. In the absence of a major military breakthrough by either side this year, Ukraine's ability to survive a second winter of attacks has been a focus of concern for many people.
Last year, starting in October, Russia mounted a concerted campaign to starve Ukraine of energy, apparently seeking to disrupt the country's fighting capability and sap the will of Ukrainians to continue the war.
The Ukrainian authorities say that barrage of missile and exploding-drone strikes would have put the country's electricity grid out of action were it not for the efforts of utility workers and support from Kyiv's Western partners. Even so, the assault left many Ukrainians in the dark and cold and hurt the country's economy.
Ukraine's energy sector has prepared extensively for the likelihood of another winter assault, repairing and shielding electricity substations and installing additional power production capacity. Air defenses including Patriot missile systems supplied by the country's NATO allies have also made the country less vulnerable.
At the same time, Ukraine has ramped up its attacks on Russian-occupied territory and Russia itself.
RIA Novosti reported that the country's air defenses had shot down 11 Ukrainian drones in western Russia overnight and nine others on Sunday. Moscow's mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said that some of the drones had been flying toward his city. Drones were also intercepted in the Bryansk, Kaluga and Tula regions of western Russia, according to RIA.
Ukraine has targeted energy infrastructure specifically, launching at least five attacks since October on at least three electricity substations and an oil refinery in the Krasnodar region of Russia, according to the Ukrainian authorities, who maintain that they attack only power facilities directly linked to Russia's military campaign.
Five people were injured in Russia's attack on Kyiv overnight into Saturday, an assault that Ukraine said involved about 75 drones and that President Volodymyr Zelensky described as "deliberate terror." Russian forces then followed up overnight into Sunday with further drone attacks.
Ukraine's air force said on Telegram that it had shot down eight of the nine drones that Russia launched. It did not say where the drone that got through its defenses had struck.

Clothes Capture That Holiday Spirit: [Style Desk]

Full text: Keith Nielsen, who oversaw costumes for four Hallmark Christmas movies out this year, shares his approach to dressing festively. (It does not involve ugly sweaters.)
Several years ago, Keith Nielsen was feeling less than cheerful when a friend told him about an internship opportunity with the costume department of the TV series "Mozart in the Jungle."
After graduating from the Ringling School of Art and Design in Sarasota, Fla., in 2015, he had hoped to find a job that merged his interests in fashion design and entertainment. When he couldn't, he started working in retail. He said he had begun to feel depressed about his career by the time his friend mentioned the internship.
His only experience in costuming had been on student films, but Mr. Nielsen, who said his grandmother had taught him to sew, got the internship. "On the 'Mozart' set, I listened and learned," he said.
Mr. Nielsen, now 30, worked on the show through its final season, rising from an intern to a costume coordinator. Afterward, he started to get more costuming jobs, including for productions at the Westchester Broadway Theater, now closed, and for the TV movie "My Adventures With Santa," which was released in 2019.
The movie tapped into Mr. Nielsen's longtime fondness for Christmas, he said, and since then, he has been hired as the costume designer for about a dozen TV Christmas movies.
This year, he oversaw costumes for four films: "Mystic Christmas," a romance set in Mystic, Conn.; "Where Are You Christmas?," a largely black-and-white movie that imagines a world without the holiday; "A Merry Scottish Christmas," which was filmed at a castle in Scotland; and "A Biltmore Christmas," which was filmed at Biltmore House in Asheville, N.C. All were for the Hallmark Channel.
Working with the theater helped prepare him to take on films, he said, because he learned how to better manage fittings and deadlines while becoming more familiar with outfits from different historical periods.
"Keith has a deep understanding of fashion, culture and history, and an uncanny taste and style, especially for period pieces," said Dustin Rikert, the director of "A Merry Scottish Christmas." Mr. Rikert also worked with Mr. Nielsen on "Next Stop, Christmas," which was broadcast in 2021. Costumes Mr. Nielsen created for that movie included the outfits worn by a time-traveling train conductor played by Christopher Lloyd.
The director John Putch, who worked with Mr. Nielsen on "A Biltmore Christmas" and on "A Holiday Spectacular," a 2022 movie featuring the Radio City Rockettes, noted his love of details. "Keith is into the shoelaces and socks people don't see," Mr. Putch said.
Mr. Nielsen, who lives in Manchester, Conn., said many of his costume ideas originate from what he jokingly described as "my 12-year-old gay-boy mind." (He declined to provide specific wardrobe budgets for films he has worked on as a costume designer.) In the edited interview below, he discussed the aesthetic influences that have inspired his work and the ways he has conjured the holiday spirit through clothes.
How do you source costumes?
I read a script about four times and let my imagination run. Many holiday films are made in three weeks or fewer, so I often only have a couple of days to get fittings done.
When I was costuming for theater, I started seeing old Broadway shows and going to warehouses that I still use. The vendor Right to the Moon Alice is where I get vintage items. I also get them from Ann Roth, an Oscar-winning costume designer, who has amazing pieces at her warehouse in Pennsylvania.
Hallmark likes color and saturation. To get that freshness on camera, sometimes I recreate a garment so it doesn't look like it has been sitting in a closet for 70 years.
Do you ever buy clothes off the rack?
I shop at outlets and online. I like J. Crew, Banana Republic and, for suits and coats, Brooks Brothers. Kate Spade has bags in bright reds and greens. I don't like ugly Christmas sweaters.
One costume in "A Biltmore Christmas" started as a Carolina Herrera gown that was bought from the RealReal. We had several fittings to re-drape the skirt, add a double-tulle layer and create a gathered bust that draped around the back. When I turn an existing garment into something else, I call it Frankenstein-ing.
What has inspired your approach to costuming?
I am a sap and love nostalgia and old Hollywood. Bill Travilla's costumes for Marilyn Monroe are some of my favorites, especially those for "How to Marry a Millionaire." I also like Arianne Phillips, who has designed costumes for film and for Madonna. I admire her breadth of work. I never want to get pigeonholed.
How do locations like Biltmore House influence your process?
I walked through the mansion to get ideas from the space. I remember looking at the colors of the wood paneling and of the limestone. Window shades are kept at a certain level and rooms are kept dimly lit to protect the things inside from light. It's very romantic and cozy, and I wanted wardrobes that communicated warmth and coziness using colors besides red and green.
To create a gown and a kilt worn by the stars of "A Merry Scottish Christmas," I pulled together a bunch of tartans that went with the tapestries, candles and dark wood at the castle. We settled on MacDonald of Glencoe, a tartan with holiday-like jewel tones. The pattern was digitally printed on the fabric used to make the gown, and the kilt was made with a traditional wool tartan.
What are some challenges with costuming holiday films?
It's the little things. All clothing sizes have changed: Vintage shoes are narrower than shoes are today, jackets fit differently, and girdles are gone. It's hard to find people to do embroidery and beading.
But I like classic and timeless looks because Christmas movies are watched over and over.

Full text: The number of Republicans opposing him grew as a bipartisan group discussed taking action to empower the temporary speaker to conduct legislative business on the House floor.
Representative Jim Jordan, the hard-line Republican from Ohio, lost a second bid for speaker on Wednesday after running headlong into opposition from a group of mainstream G.O.P. holdouts who vowed to block the ultraconservative from the leadership post.
Mr. Jordan said he would keep fighting to secure the majority of votes he needs to become speaker, and spent much of Wednesday afternoon meeting with some of the holdouts. But it was clear after the second ballot that there was no immediate end in sight to the stalemate that has left the House leaderless and in turmoil after two weeks of Republican infighting.
Republicans adjourned the House on Wednesday evening and were set to reconvene at noon on Thursday to find a way forward.
As the chaos continued, a group of Republicans and Democrats was discussing taking explicit action to empower Representative Patrick T. McHenry, the North Carolina Republican who has been serving as temporary speaker, to conduct legislative business on the House floor, which has been paralyzed for weeks. But Republicans were divided even on doing that, with some Jordan loyalists arguing that it would set a damaging precedent.
Still, many lawmakers have grown deeply alarmed about the absence of an elected speaker as wars are raging in Israel and Ukraine and the government is within weeks of shutting down if Congress fails to reach a spending agreement.
Allies of Mr. Jordan, the co-founder of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus and a close ally of former President Donald J. Trump, had initially hoped he would pick up momentum on the second vote. Instead, the number of Republicans refusing to back him grew by two on Wednesday. Mr. Jordan won 199 votes and Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the Democratic leader, won 212 votes. Four Republicans who had voted for Mr. Jordan on the first ballot rose to oppose him, and two Republicans who had voted against Mr. Jordan on the first ballot changed their votes and supported him.
"We picked up some today, a couple dropped off," Mr. Jordan said after the vote. "But they voted for me before, I think they can come back again." He noted that former Speaker Kevin McCarthy's bid for the top job had also stalled after around 20 holdouts opposed him on multiple ballots.
But several of the mainstream Republicans who voted against Mr. Jordan said they were irrevocably opposed to his candidacy, and predicted that opposition to the Ohio Republican would only grow. Many of them said they were emboldened to hold their ground by the pressure campaign that Mr. Jordan's allies unleashed on them over the weekend to try to get them to cave and support him. The tactics included posting the holdouts' names and office phone numbers to social media and in some cases running robocalls in their districts.
"Somebody advising him thought it was a good idea to try to shine a spotlight on us and to try to shame us on the floor," Representative Nick LaLota of New York said. "That tactic obviously didn't work. It probably dug some members in stronger."
Mr. Jordan and his allies had made the calculation that the lawmakers opposing him, almost entirely from the party's more mainstream wing, would fall into line when forced to vote against him on the House floor, facing pressure from conservative voters and media personalities. Those moderate lawmakers normally seek compromise, and the bet was that they would want to quickly patch over Republican divisions and move forward to get the House working again in regular order.
Instead, said Representative Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, one of the holdouts, the strategy "backfired dramatically."
Mr. Diaz-Balart added of Mr. Jordan's path to the speakership, "I think it gets more and more difficult for him every day."
"If you succumb to threats and intimidation and all that, the rest of your life you'll just be threatened and intimidated," said Representative Carlos Gimenez of Florida, who has said he will continue voting for Mr. McCarthy.
The vote underscored the deep rifts inside the House Republican conference, but it also signaled how far the group has lurched to the right. Among the 199 Republicans who voted for Mr. Jordan were many mainstream Republicans, including a dozen from districts President Biden won in 2020, all of whom were willing to give Mr. Jordan the post second in line to the presidency.
Those were votes to elevate a lawmaker who helped Mr. Trump try to overturn the 2020 election, who has used his power in Congress to defend the former president and whose long track record of opposing compromise prompted a previous Republican speaker to brand him a "legislative terrorist."
In the absence of a clear path forward, there was growing discussion about holding a vote to approve giving Mr. McHenry control over the House floor until the deadlock could be broken, perhaps through Jan. 3.
Mr. McHenry is acting as temporary speaker under rules adopted after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that require the speaker of the House to come up with a list of people to fill the post in the event that it becomes vacant. When Mr. McCarthy was booted out by a right-wing rebellion two weeks ago, the world learned that Mr. McHenry was the first name on his list.
Many House aides believe that Mr. McHenry's power is strictly confined to presiding over the election of a new speaker, as he has been doing this week. But because this situation has not come up before, some congressional scholars argue that the bounds of the acting speaker's power are largely dependent on what a majority of members are willing to authorize.
Some Republicans, particularly Mr. Jordan's staunchest supporters, have resisted such a move because it would sap momentum for the party to unite behind him -- or any other Republican. They argued that the maneuver would set a damaging precedent.
"I violently oppose any effort to do that on the House floor," said Representative Chip Roy, Republican of Texas, calling the idea "directly contrary to the Constitution."
In the meantime, many Republicans were openly fretting that their deep internal divisions were hanging a political albatross around the party's neck ahead of the 2024 election.
"I just want to get us to an option where we can get this place functioning again," said Representative Steve Womack of Arkansas, one of the holdouts against Mr. Jordan. "We need to rebrand ourselves, I think, and get back to running this government."

U.S. Adds Restrictions On Chips For China: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The further limits on shipments could cripple Beijing's A.I. ambitions and dampen revenues for U.S. chip makers, analysts said.
The Biden administration on Tuesday announced additional limits on sales of advanced semiconductors by American firms, shoring up restrictions issued last October to limit China's progress on supercomputing and artificial intelligence.
The rules appear likely to halt most shipments of advanced semiconductors from the United States to Chinese data centers, which use them to produce models capable of artificial intelligence. More U.S. companies seeking to sell China advanced chips, or the machinery used to make them, will be required to notify the government of their plans, or obtain a special license.
To prevent the risk that advanced U.S. chips travel to China through third countries, the United States will also require chip makers to obtain licenses to ship to dozens of other countries that are subject to U.S. arms embargoes.
The Biden administration argues that China's access to such advanced technology is dangerous because it could aid the country's military in tasks like guiding hypersonic missiles, setting up advanced surveillance systems or cracking top-secret U.S. codes. Leading A.I. experts have warned that the technology, if not properly managed, could pose existential threats to humanity.
But artificial intelligence also has valuable commercial applications, and the tougher restrictions may affect Chinese companies that have been trying to develop A.I. chatbots like ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, or the internet giant Baidu, industry analysts said. In the longer run, the limits could also weaken China's economy, given that A.I. is transforming industries ranging from retail to health care.
The limits also appear likely to affect sales to China of U.S. chip makers such as Nvidia, AMD and Intel. Some chip makers earn as much as a third of their revenue from Chinese buyers and spent recent months lobbying against tighter restrictions.
U.S. officials said the rules would exempt chips that were purely for use in commercial applications, like smartphones, laptops, electric vehicles and gaming systems. Most of the rules will take effect in 30 days, though some will be effective sooner.
In a statement, the Semiconductor Industry Association, which represents major chip makers, said it was evaluating the impact of the updated rules.
"We recognize the need to protect national security and believe maintaining a healthy U.S. semiconductor industry is an essential component to achieving that goal," the group said. "Overly broad, unilateral controls risk harming the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem without advancing national security as they encourage overseas customers to look elsewhere."
A spokesperson for Nvidia said that the company complied with all applicable regulations and that it did not expect a meaningful near-term effect on its financial results, given worldwide demand for Nvidia's products.
In a call with reporters on Monday, a senior administration official said that the United States had seen people try to work around the earlier rules, and that recent breakthroughs in generative A.I. had given regulators more insight into how the so-called large language models behind it were being developed and used.
Gina M. Raimondo, the secretary of commerce, said the changes had been made "to ensure that these rules are as effective as possible" and that she expected the rules to be updated at least annually as technology advanced.
Referring to the People's Republic of China, she said, "The goal is the same goal that it's always been, which is to limit P.R.C. access to advanced semiconductors that could fuel breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and sophisticated computers that are critical to P.R.C. military applications."
She added, "Controlling technology is more important than ever as it relates to national security."
The tougher rules could anger Chinese officials when the Biden administration is trying to improve relations and prepare for a potential meeting between President Biden and China's top leader, Xi Jinping, in California next month.
The Biden administration has been trying to counter China's growing mastery of many cutting-edge technologies by pumping money into new chip factories in the United States. It has simultaneously been trying to set tough but narrow restrictions on exports of technology to China that could have military uses, while allowing other trade to flow freely. U.S. officials describe the strategy as protecting American technology with "a small yard and high fence."
But determining which technologies really pose a threat to national security has been a contentious task. Major semiconductor companies have argued that overly restrictive trade bans can sap them of the revenue they need to invest in new plants and research facilities in the United States.
Some critics say the limits could also fuel China's efforts to develop alternative technologies, ultimately weakening U.S. influence globally. Chinese researchers have made significant progress in developing domestic versions of advanced chips, but experts say the country remains years behind Western capabilities.
The changes announced Tuesday appear to have particularly significant implications for Nvidia, the biggest beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom.
In response to the Biden administration's first major restrictions on artificial intelligence chips a year ago, Nvidia designed new chips, the A800 and H800, for the Chinese market that worked at slower speeds but could still be used by Chinese firms to train A.I. models. A senior administration official said the new rules would restrict those sales.
Nvidia has said that China typically generates 20 percent to 25 percent of the company's data center revenue, which includes other products in addition to chips that enable A.I. Analysts said that growing global demand for Nvidia chips for use in A.I. might allow the company to offset those losses by selling to other markets instead. But concerns about the impact of new performance limits on a wider set of Nvidia chips caused its stock price to fall more than 3 percent Tuesday.
The administration also placed two Chinese chip design companies and their subsidiaries -- units of Moore Threads Technology and Biren Technology -- on an "entity list" that requires U.S. companies to receive special permission before they can ship materials to them.
The United States also said it would create a new "gray list" that requires makers of certain less advanced chips to notify the government if they are selling them to China, Iran or other countries subject to a U.S. arms embargo.
"What strikes me is the significant expansion of countries to which exports will now require a license," said Emily Benson, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
The rules did not appear to limit Chinese firms' access to foreign cloud services run by Amazon and Microsoft. The administration had considered clamping down on that business in recent months because Chinese firms had used such services as a kind of backdoor to access advanced artificial intelligence chips outside of China. But Ms. Benson said such a measure could come later in the form of an executive order.
In a note to clients last week, Julian Evans-Pritchard, the head of China economics at the research firm Capital Economics, said the effects of the controls would become more apparent as non-Chinese companies rolled out more advanced versions of their current products.
"The upshot is that China's ability to reach the technological frontier in the development of large-scale A.I. models will be hampered by U.S. export controls," Mr. Evans-Pritchard wrote. That could have broader implications for the Chinese economy, he added, since "we think A.I. has the potential to be a game changer for productivity growth over the next couple decades."

But AI also has valuable commercial applications, and the tougher restrictions may affect Chinese companies like ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, or the internet giant Baidu, that have been trying to develop AI chatbots, industry analysts said. In the longer run, the limits could also weaken China’s economy, given that AI is transforming industries ranging from retail to health care.
The limits also appear likely to affect sales to China of U.S. chipmakers such as Nvidia, AMD and Intel. Some chipmakers earn as much as one-third of their revenue from Chinese buyers and spent recent months lobbying against tighter restrictions.
U.S. officials said the rules would exempt chips that were purely for use in commercial applications, such as smartphones, laptops, electric vehicles and gaming systems. Most of the rules will take effect in 30 days, though some will be effective sooner.
In a statement, the Semiconductor Industry Association, which represents major chipmakers, said it was evaluating the impact of the updated rules.
“We recognize the need to protect national security and believe maintaining a healthy U.S. semiconductor industry is an essential component to achieving that goal,” the group said. “Overly broad, unilateral controls risk harming the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem without advancing national security as they encourage overseas customers to look elsewhere.”
A spokesperson for Nvidia said the company complied with all applicable regulations and that it did not expect a meaningful near-term effect on its financial results, given worldwide demand for Nvidia’s products.
In a call with reporters Monday, a senior administration official said the United States had seen people try to work around the earlier rules, and that recent breakthroughs in generative AI had given regulators more insight into how the so-called large language models behind it were being developed and used.
Gina Raimondo, the secretary of commerce, said the changes had been made “to ensure that these rules are as effective as possible,” and that she expected the rules to be updated at least annually as technology advanced.
Referring to the People’s Republic of China, she said, “The goal is the same goal that it’s always been, which is to limit PRC access to advanced semiconductors that could fuel breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and sophisticated computers that are critical to PRC military applications.”
She added, “Controlling technology is more important than ever as it relates to national security.”
The tougher rules could anger Chinese officials when the Biden administration is trying to improve relations and prepare for a potential meeting between President Joe Biden and China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, in California next month.
The Biden administration has been trying to counter China’s growing mastery of many cutting-edge technologies by pumping money into new chip factories in the United States. It has simultaneously been trying to set tough but narrow restrictions on exports of technology to China that could have military uses, while allowing other trade to flow freely. U.S. officials describe the strategy as protecting American technology with “a small yard and high fence.”
But determining which technologies really pose a threat to national security has been a contentious task. Major semiconductor companies have argued that overly restrictive trade bans can sap them of the revenue they need to invest in new plants and research facilities in the United States.
Some critics say the limits could also fuel China’s efforts to develop alternative technologies, ultimately weakening U.S. influence globally. Chinese researchers have made significant progress in developing domestic versions of advanced chips, but experts say the country remains years behind Western capabilities.
The changes announced Tuesday appear to have particularly significant implications for Nvidia, the biggest beneficiary of the AI boom.
In response to the Biden administration’s first major restrictions on artificial intelligence chips a year ago, Nvidia designed new chips, the A800 and H800, for the Chinese market that worked at slower speeds but could still be used by Chinese firms to train AI models. A senior administration official said the new rules would restrict those sales.
Nvidia has said that China typically generates 20% to 25% of the company’s data center revenue, which includes other products in addition to chips that enable AI. Analysts said that growing global demand for Nvidia chips for use in AI might allow the company to offset those losses by selling to other markets instead. But concerns about the impact of new performance limits on a wider set of Nvidia chips caused its stock price to fall more than 3% Tuesday.
The administration also placed two Chinese chip design companies and their subsidiaries — units of Moore Threads Technology and Biren Technology — on an “entity list” that requires U.S. companies to receive special permission before they can ship materials to them.
The United States also said it would create a new “gray list” that requires makers of certain less advanced chips to notify the government if they are selling them to China, Iran or other countries subject to a U.S. arms embargo.
“What strikes me is the significant expansion of countries to which exports will now require a license,” said Emily Benson, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
The rules did not appear to limit Chinese firms’ access to foreign cloud services run by Amazon and Microsoft. The administration had considered clamping down on that business in recent months because Chinese firms had used such services as a kind of backdoor to access advanced AI chips outside of China. But Benson said such a measure could come later in the form of an executive order.
In a note to clients last week, Julian Evans-Pritchard, the head of China economics at the research firm Capital Economics, said the effects of the controls would become more apparent as non-Chinese companies rolled out more advanced versions of their current products.
“The upshot is that China’s ability to reach the technological frontier in the development of large-scale AI models will be hampered by U.S. export controls,” Evans-Pritchard wrote. That could have broader implications for the Chinese economy, he added, since “we think AI has the potential to be a game changer for productivity growth over the next couple decades.”

Full text: This true-crime documentary investigates a murder case in a tiny Australian town, showcasing its brash inhabitants.
You might think that a murder case in a one-horse town of 11 people would be a little easier to solve. You would be wrong when it comes to the remote Australian outpost of "Last Stop Larrimah," a true-crime documentary which gives free rein to the gossip and bickering of its mutually suspicious inhabitants.
Fran the meat-pie queen, her pub-owning rival, Barry, and his dog-loving bartender, Richard, are among those holding forth on the mystery of Paddy Moriarty -- a "larrikin" (in Aussie parlance) who sounds less and less endearing. Paddy and his dog disappeared one night shortly before Christmas in 2017. The sometimes entertaining residents of Larrimah spin theories about each other for the film's director, Thomas Tancred, who adds their past incautious interviews for television.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Tancred finds initial charm in the Australian embrace of big personalities like these sunbaked veterans of the Northern Territory. But the movie resembles reality shows that string together insinuations and trash-talk without knowing when to quit. The convoluted structure feels like overworked dough, with some dubious song cues and oddly dismissive treatment of police investigators. (As a murder mystery, the movie also games the system by postponing crucial information.)
The bloat saps the fun and intrigue from the film, which can't navigate between playing up eccentricity and committing to the notion that hell can be other people (even in a one-time refuge). The infighting seems quaint in the first hour, but by the second, you just want to get out of town.
Last Stop Larrimah
Not rated. Running time: 1 hour 58 minutes. Watch on HBO platforms.

Markets Tick Higher on Idea That Fed May Be Done Raising Rates: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Most U.S. stocks ticked higher Wednesday amid mixed yields in the bond market, which has been the main driver of Wall Street's moves recently.
The S&P 500 rose 18.71, or 0.4 percent, to 4,376.95 for its fourth straight gain. The Dow Jones industrial average added 65.57 points, or 0.2 percent, to 33,804.87, and the Nasdaq composite gained 96.83, or 0.7 percent, to 13,659.68.
Wall Street has been mostly struggling since the summer as longer-term yields shoot higher in the bond market, weighing on prices for all kinds of investments. Some relief has come this week, and yields have eased after officials at the Federal Reserve suggested they may be done raising their main overnight interest rate.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.57 percent from 4.66 percent Tuesday and from more than 4.80 percent last week, when it reached its highest level since 2007. Besides hurting prices for investments, high yields have jacked up rates for mortgages and other loans, which saps momentum from the economy.
But the two-year Treasury yield, which moves more closely with expectations for the Fed, ticked up to 4.99 percent from 4.97 percent.
Yields were mixed after a report showed inflation at the wholesale level was stronger last month than economists expected. A report showing how much inflation U.S. households are facing will arrive on Thursday, and economists expect it to show a slowdown.
While the report on wholesale inflation was above expectations, Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, said it wasn't enough to change her forecast that the Fed's main interest rate is already at its peak.
"Fed officials are gradually taking comfort with the fact that the July rate hike may have been the last one in this historic tightening cycle," said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY.
Minutes from the Fed's meeting last month suggested officials see the outlook for the U.S. economy as particularly uncertain. They said they were ready to "proceed carefully" in deciding what to do next with rates.
A Fed on hold could provide some oxygen for financial markets. They've struggled as the 10-year yield has jumped for a few reasons, including a remarkably resilient U.S. economy that has erased some worries about a possible recession and removed expectations for the Fed to take it much easier on short-term rates.
With the U.S. government racking up big deficits, which requires more borrowing, and buyers in shorter supply, the pressure has been mostly upward on Treasury yields.
Strategists at Bank of America say it's hard to forecast where the 10-year Treasury yield will go, but they cannot rule out a climb above 5 percent.
They see U.S. rates stopping their climb following clearer signs that high rates are becoming "sufficiently restrictive" to the economy. That could show itself through a moderating U.S. economy, struggles for stocks and other risky investments and a shift in commentary by Fed officials.
"Recent Fed commentary suggests concern over financial conditions; we suspect the Fed would judge another 10 percent decline in risk assets reflects sufficiently restrictive rates," strategists led by Mark Cabana wrote in a BofA Global Research report.
A further pullback in crude oil prices is helping to take some heat off inflation and support Wall Street.
A barrel of U.S. crude oil slumped $ 2.48 to settle at $ 83.49. Brent crude, the international standard, fell $ 1.83 to $ 85.82 per barrel.
They've given back much of their strong gains from earlier this week, triggered by fighting in Gaza. Though the area doesn't produce much oil, the worry was that the violence could spill into the politics around the crude market and hurt the flow of petroleum.

Putin Was Close to Netanyahu. So Why Is Russia Silent Now?: [News Analysis]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Vladimir Putin has long projected friendly ties to Israel. But his silence since Saturday's assault illustrates how the war in Ukraine has strained the relationship between the two countries.
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has long cast himself as a friend of Israel and the Jewish people.
He helped establish visa-free travel between Russia and Israel in 2008, presided over the construction of a sprawling Moscow Jewish Museum in 2012 and, side by side with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem in 2020, unveiled a memorial to the victims of Nazi Germany's siege of Leningrad.
But amid the worst attack on Israel in 50 years, the high regard that Mr. Putin has shown for Israel in the past appears remarkably absent. More than three days after the start of the incursion by Hamas, there has been no message of condolence from the Kremlin, even though Mr. Putin previously published such notes of sympathy in the wake of terrorist attacks in Israel.
And he has not yet called Mr. Netanyahu, even though he spoke with Israeli leaders at least 11 times in 2022 and developed a close relationship with Mr. Netanyahu over more than a decade of meetings and phone calls.
Instead, in his first brief comments on the attack, Mr. Putin took a swipe at the United States, without expressing any sympathy for Israeli suffering.
"This is a clear example of the failure of United States policy in the Middle East," Mr. Putin said on Tuesday in a televised meeting at the Kremlin with Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, the Iraqi prime minister.
Rather than find a compromise amenable to both sides, Mr. Putin went on, Washington acted "each time without taking into account the fundamental interests of the Palestinian people."
On Russian state television and in the pro-Kremlin blogosphere, commentators have reacted to the attack on Israel with thinly veiled glee, casting it as a revelation of Western weakness and as the start of a war that could sap Western support for Ukraine.
The stark shift sheds light on one consequence of Mr. Putin's invasion of Ukraine: the sharp decline in the relationship between Moscow and Israel over the past year and a half, one that some Jewish leaders fear also presages a rise in antisemitism inside Russia.
It is also the latest conflict in a region where Moscow has played a major role but where it is now unwilling or unable to wield much influence. That played out dramatically last month in the Caucasus region, where Russia did not even seem to try to stop Azerbaijan from seizing control of the Armenian-populated breakaway enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh -- a stinging defeat for Armenia, Russia's military ally.
While Moscow's support for the Palestinian cause dates to Soviet times, Mr. Putin balanced that by forging strong ties to Israel. So the Kremlin's arms-length stance toward Israel in recent days "is definitely a manifestation of a deteriorating relationship," said Pinchas Goldschmidt, who served as the chief rabbi of Moscow for nearly 30 years until being forced to flee the country last year because, he said, he refused to support the war in Ukraine.
Rabbi Goldschmidt spoke by phone from Israel, where he had just attended the funeral of an Israeli soldier slain in the fighting on Saturday; he said the deceased, Yuval Ben Yaakov, was the son of another former Moscow rabbi. He added that many Jewish leaders had once seen Mr. Putin as an ally in keeping the memory of World War II alive, but when the Russian president started falsely equating Ukraine's current government to Nazi Germany to justify an invasion, "that's when the Jews said: 'We're not part of it."'
There are clear geopolitical reasons for Mr. Putin's shift on Israel. In the Middle East, where Russia has long tried to play a kingmaker role and build relations with all major powers, Moscow now finds itself beholden to Iran -- Israel's bitter enemy -- as one of its primary arms suppliers for the war in Ukraine.
And unlike in years past, when Mr. Putin sought ways to cooperate with Western countries, he now appears to see little incentive to try to work with them to broker an end to the fighting in Israel as Russian forces are being pummeled by Western weaponry in Ukraine.
But there are also, perhaps, more personal reasons. Mr. Putin appears stung that Israel and Jewish leaders around the world are not backing his false narrative about Ukraine's being run by "Nazis." In recent months, he has repeatedly lashed out at President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine for heading a Nazi government despite being Jewish. In June, Mr. Putin claimed that his "many Jewish friends" had told him that Mr. Zelensky was "a disgrace to the Jewish people."
There have been signs since last year that the relationship was fraying. Russia cracked down on the Jewish Agency, an Israeli nonprofit that was a mainstay of Jewish life in Russia and helped Russian Jews move to Israel. In June, Russia's Foreign Ministry summoned the Israeli ambassador to claim that Israel's envoy to Ukraine was complicit in "whitewashing" Nazi crimes. (Some Ukrainian independence fighters fought alongside Nazi Germany against the Soviet Union in World War II, the foundation of Mr. Putin's spurious claims that Ukraine's current leaders are Nazis.)
"No one in the Kremlin is rushing to show sympathy to the victims" of Hamas's incursion into Israel, said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. "This also shows you the emotional attitude -- 'grievance' is the right word."
He added that the Russian propagandists casting the incursion as a boon for Russia may have a point. The Kremlin "passively is a beneficiary for now, at least," of the fighting, Mr. Gabuev said -- if only because senior officials in Washington may have less time to focus on how best to support Ukraine.
The Kremlin's grievance -- even Schadenfreude -- has played out on Russian state television in recent days. Many commentators taunted the tens of thousands of Russian Jews who had fled to Israel after Mr. Putin's invasion of Ukraine -- in some cases to avoid being drafted into the Russian Army -- and who now found themselves in the middle of another war.
"Let's watch him go into Gaza now with a weapon in hand," one talk show guest said of a Russian tech tycoon, Arkady Volozh, who had relocated to Israel and spoken out against the invasion of Ukraine.
Others on television crowed about the weekend's military and intelligence failures by Israel and its Western allies, while predicting that the developments could play into Russia's hands by distracting the West from supporting Ukraine.
"The image of the invincible Israeli fortress has just collapsed," said Olga Skabeyeva, a talk-show host on the Rossiya-1 channel. Referring to the warships that the United States is now moving closer to Israel, she added, "Are U.S. aircraft carriers next?"
For all of Mr. Putin's apparent frustration that Israel has not endorsed his rationale for invasion, Mr. Netanyahu's government has been cautious in its support for Ukraine, drawing the ire of Kyiv, as well. Experts say that Israel has been keen not to overly antagonize Russia given Moscow's close ties to Iran, to limit the blowback against Jews still in Russia and to preserve the communications between the Israeli and Russian militaries operating in Syria that allow their forces to avoid coming into conflict there.
Israel has not participated in Western sanctions against Russia, and has refused to provide weapons to Ukraine because, Mr. Netanyahu has said, they could end up in Iranian hands. In June, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry claimed that the Israeli government was ignoring the suffering of Ukrainian Jews while opting for "a path of close cooperation with the Russian Federation."
But in recent days, Mr. Zelensky has cast those criticisms aside and embraced Israel's cause. In a speech to NATO on Monday, he said that Russia and Hamas, the Palestinian faction that controls Gaza, represented "the same evil."
"The only difference is that there is a terrorist organization that attacked Israel, and here is a terrorist state that attacked Ukraine," Mr. Zelensky said.

“Let’s watch him go into Gaza now with a weapon in hand,” one talk show guest said of a Russian tech tycoon, Arkady Volozh, who had relocated to Israel and spoken out against the invasion of Ukraine.
Others on television crowed about the weekend’s military and intelligence failures by Israel and its Western allies, while predicting that the developments could play into Russia’s hands by distracting the West from supporting Ukraine.
“The image of the invincible Israeli fortress has just collapsed,” said Olga Skabeyeva, a talk-show host on the Rossiya-1 channel. Referring to the warships that the United States is now moving closer to Israel, she added, “Are U.S. aircraft carriers next?”
For all of Putin’s apparent frustration that Israel has not endorsed his rationale for invasion, Netanyahu’s government has been cautious in its support for Ukraine, drawing the ire of Kyiv, as well. Experts say Israel has been keen not to overly antagonize Russia given Moscow’s close ties to Iran, to limit the blowback against Jews still in Russia and to preserve the communications between the Israeli and Russian militaries operating in Syria that allow their forces to avoid coming into conflict there.
Israel has not participated in Western sanctions against Russia, and has refused to provide weapons to Ukraine because, Netanyahu has said, they could end up in Iranian hands. In June, Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry claimed that the Israeli government was ignoring the suffering of Ukrainian Jews while opting for “a path of close cooperation with the Russian Federation.”
But in recent days, Zelenskyy has cast those criticisms aside and embraced Israel’s cause. In a speech to NATO on Monday, he said that Russia and Hamas, the Palestinian faction that controls Gaza, represented “the same evil.”
“The only difference is that there is a terrorist organization that attacked Israel, and here is a terrorist state that attacked Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said.

IBM Tries Assuring Customers Generative A.I. Is a Safe Bet: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company will assume the legal risk of businesses that use its A.I. systems and will publish the technology's underlying data.
There is no shortage of excitement in corporate America for the new artificial intelligence that can produce everything from business reports to computer code with humanlike fluency.
Plenty of companies are experimenting with the technology, called generative A.I., but they are worried about how confidential data will be handled, the accuracy of A.I.-generated answers and potential legal liability.
IBM on Thursday announced its campaign to ease customers' qualms. The company said it would indemnify companies against copyright or other intellectual property claims for using its generative A.I. systems. IBM will also publish its data sets -- the underlying data that is used to build or "train" the A.I. system -- which is not standard practice among commercial providers of generative A.I. technology.
The announcement is an indication that, while attention has been focused on the new A.I. technology in chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT, IBM is laying its plans to tackle the market.
IBM's customers are mostly other businesses, and persuading those companies to use new A.I. products means assuring them that they won't run into legal trouble. OpenAI, for example, has already been sued by a collection of authors who accuse it of infringing on their copyrights by using their books to train ChatGPT.
Over the last year, start-ups like OpenAI and other industry giants like Google and Microsoft have been much more aggressive than IBM about publicly discussing their A.I. work. Even Meta, the parent company of Facebook, this week introduced A.I. chatbots meant to sound like celebrities such as the quarterback Tom Brady and the hip-hop artist Snoop Dogg.
IBM's relatively quiet stance showed how much the tech industry had changed in the 12 years since IBM's Watson A.I. system beat top competitors on "Jeopardy!" A.I. became a centerpiece of IBM's pitch to corporate customers, but the company has been overshadowed by younger competitors in the nearly yearlong A.I. frenzy in the tech industry.
Other technology suppliers are also trying to reassure customers by assuming legal risks. Microsoft pledged this month to defend customers in any copyright suits that arise from using its A.I.-powered Copilots, which it is adding to its office productivity software and programming tools. Adobe has made a similar commitment for copyright claims against customers using Adobe Firefly, its A.I. art-generation software.
The IBM A.I. systems -- or "models," as developers call them -- are tailored for use by businesses. And the training data has been curated with companies in mind and culled from the internet, academic journals, computer code repositories, and legal and finance documents, the company said.
IBM appears to be going further than other companies in taking on risk and opening up its model-training data. But it is in step with where the business market for generative A.I. is heading, said Patrick Moorhead, chief executive of Moor Insights & Strategy, a technology analysis firm.
The big A.I.-fueled consumer services like ChatGPT and Google's Bard are closed, and people outside the companies behind them cannot usually see what data those systems are built on. That will not satisfy most corporate customers, Mr. Moorhead said.
"Businesses need to know the data inputs and get a sense of why you got the answer you did," he said. "Putting their customer or confidential data into an A.I. model is seen as high risk for a business."
IBM is positioning itself as a partner for companies that want to create their own A.I. technology, by adding their business data to IBM's open models.
The early focus of most business technology companies, including Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce and SAP, has largely been on embedding generative A.I. to improve their existing digital tools for office productivity, supply chain management, customer service and marketing.
IBM will deploy that A.I. in its products as well, but its emphasis is helping businesses become creators, as well as customers, of generative A.I. technology.
In business, the A.I. models are large, but far smaller than needed for the big consumer chatbots, said Rob Thomas, IBM's senior vice president for software. The narrower focus also helps improve accuracy. "And for our market, accuracy is way more important than size," he said.
The smaller models also require far less computing firepower than the giant consumer chatbots. That, Mr. Thomas said, should open the door to wider use of generative A.I. in operations that promise an immediate impact and payoff, including customer service, automated back-office tasks and digital assistants for writing code.
In those fields, "we see a defensible return on investment at the moment," Mr. Thomas said. "The economics work."

The Dollar Still Has Plenty of Swagger: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Sommer, Jeff

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The U.S. currency has been on a tear, and the Fed's decision to keep interest rates steady is likely to keep the dollar "higher for longer," our columnist says.
Bet against the dollar at your peril.
After the dollar's sharp rally since July, it may be tempting to do so. Earlier this year, before the rebound, spot currency traders made good money wagering that the dollar would decline from the 20-year highs it reached in 2022. And while the dollar dominates world trade, a host of nations, including China and Russia, are maneuvering to unseat it.
At the same time, political conflicts in the United States -- like the debt-ceiling brinkmanship in the spring and subsequent credit downgrade, and the current risk of a government shutdown -- have threatened to dim the dollar's luster.
But the Federal Reserve's decision on Wednesday to hold rates at an elevated level is likely to buttress the dollar in foreign exchange markets.
Still, an underlying truth abides: The dollar remains the linchpin of the global economy. It is the currency around which nearly all others revolve, the world's haven in times of trouble -- even when that trouble emanates from the United States itself.
What's more, the relative vigor of the U.S. economy and the Fed's tight monetary policy have been pushing up the value of the dollar against most other currencies. Since July, the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against six other important currencies, has risen more than 5 percent.
While it's down from last October's peak, it remains more than 40 percent higher than in 2011. Against the Japanese yen and the Chinese renminbi, the dollar has been strong enough to warrant discussion of government currency intervention in Asia to reduce the foreign exchange disparities.
The Fed and the Dollar
"Higher for longer" is a Wall Street summary of the Fed's interest rate policy, and it is apt. Fed projections released on Wednesday suggested that to bring inflation down to its target of 2 percent, the Fed may need to move the federal funds rate up to 5.625 percent from the current range of 5.25 to 5.5 percent by the end of this year, and to hold rates above 5 percent in 2024.
In a news conference on Wednesday, Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said that the Fed would remain "data dependent" in making it decisions, but that until inflation came down, it would do whatever it took.
"If the economy comes in stronger than expected, that just means we will have to do more in terms of monetary policy to get back to 2 percent," he said.
Higher for longer may well apply to the dollar, too.
Because U.S. interest rates are significantly higher than those of most major countries, and the economy is growing more robustly, U.S. securities have been pulling in money, in turn bolstering the dollar's value
In many ways, the Fed is "the central banker to the world," said Kathy Jones, chief fixed-income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, in an interview. Its decisions cascade throughout foreign exchange markets, affecting the economies of a great many nations.
For the American government, the dollar's central role in global finance pays immense dividends. U.S. national debt has reached $ 33 trillion, a mind-boggling number that is adding fuel to the fight in Congress over government spending. But fiscal issues in the United States would be much more complicated without the dollar's global primacy.
The Federal Reserve has the ability to create money that is accepted universally, and the Treasury can issue dollar-denominated debt that is in high demand in world markets. This gives the government extraordinary fiscal flexibility. U.S. sway in world affairs would be constrained if it did not possess this special financial power.
Headwinds and Tailwinds
For American consumers, the highly valued dollar reduces inflation, enabling the purchase of imported goods at lower prices. And for canny travelers, it can mean cheaper and better meals and hotel rooms in countries whose currencies have declined against the dollar.
For American multinational businesses, the highly valued dollar is a mixed blessing, with some corporate divisions benefiting and others hurting.
Scores of U.S. business executives have bemoaned what they call revenue "headwinds" unleashed by the dollar's strength, which saps foreign profits when converted into American currency and can lead to higher prices for their products abroad. This was a major theme of corporate earnings calls with Wall Street analysts in 2022 and early this year.
The highly valued dollar remains a problem for multinational companies. In Apple's August earnings call, for example, Tim Cook, the chief executive, said that while the company had done extremely well over all, it continued "to face an uneven macroeconomic environment, including nearly four percentage points of foreign exchange headwinds." In July, Andre Schulten, chief financial officer of Procter & Gamble, said, "Foreign exchange rates continue to be a headwind, and based on current rates, we now expect a $ 400 million after-tax impact."
But many companies have learned to hedge against the dollar's strength, which in 2023 is no longer as clear and powerful a tailwind for U.S. companies focused on the domestic market, and a detriment for internationally focused businesses, as it was last year. A review by Bespoke Investment Group of U.S. companies' recent stock performance, based on the extent of their foreign revenue exposure, produced inconclusive results. Individual strategy matters more for a company's revenue stream than the movements of the dollar.
Global Ripples
Oil and the dollar have had a close and contentious relationship. During the 1970s oil shocks, prices soared and vast sums of money flowed from oil-consuming countries like the United States to oil producers like Saudi Arabia -- and back to the United States as investments. Leonard Silk, a New York Times financial columnist, fretted that the flow of these "petrodollars" might destroy the global financial system.
That didn't quite happen, but for many years, higher oil prices contributed to high inflation and slower economic output -- stagflation -- in the United States. The flow of petrodollars enhanced the international status of the dollar while reducing its value in foreign exchange markets. For decades, when oil prices rose, the dollar tended to decline.
But in a major shift that dates roughly to the start of Russia's war in Ukraine early in 2022, oil prices and the dollar have been moving in tandem. That is an important finding of an April study by the Bank for International Settlements, the "bank for central banks."
If the change in this relationship holds up, the latest surge in energy prices won't hurt the dollar, and may help it. Establishing the reasons isn't easy. They may partly be that fossil fuel energy is far less important to the economy than it was 50 years ago, even if rising gasoline prices are painful for consumers and irksome in the Fed's fight to tame inflation.
But mainly, I suspect, the reason is that thanks to increased production of oil and natural gas at its shale fields, the United States since 2019 has become a net exporter of energy. If anything, then, energy revenues are boosting the dollar, not impairing its value.
For countries that are net energy importers, however, this is a double whammy. Oil is customarily priced in dollars, and converting most currencies to dollars is costly.
Low-income emerging-market countries that are commodity importers are particularly vulnerable, the International Monetary Fund has found. If the United States enjoys an exalted status in global markets, thanks to the strength of the dollar and of U.S. Treasuries, a host of countries come under heightened stress when the dollar soars. Countries like Ghana, Sri Lanka, Egypt and Pakistan have already had trouble managing their debt.
There are always exceptions to these trends. The Mexican peso, Colombian peso and Brazilian real have all been strong performers against the dollar this year -- partly making up for earlier declines.
For U.S. investors, ignoring these issues and simply focusing on U.S. securities has been a successful strategy in recent decades. But it is reasonable to assume that international stocks and bonds will outperform U.S. securities at some point, and that the dollar's value will fluctuate. Broad international diversification through global stock and bond index funds is a prudent approach.
But one thing I would not suggest is making a big bet against the dollar.
"I don't see any currency that can replace it," Ms. Jones of Schwab said, "and it has held its value for a very long time."
Even periodic crises in Washington have failed to dislodge global confidence in the dollar. A new test is underway in the congressional battle over federal spending. But it's in the U.S. government's interest to maintain the dollar's special status.

Defying West, Russia Extends Missile Arsenal: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Moscow's missile production now exceeds prewar levels, officials say, leaving Ukraine especially vulnerable this coming winter.
Russia has managed to overcome sanctions and export controls imposed by the West to expand its missile production beyond prewar levels, according to U.S., European and Ukrainian officials, leaving Ukraine especially vulnerable to intensified attacks in the coming months.
In addition to spending more than $ 40 billion providing weapons for Ukraine, the United States has made curbing Russia's military supply a key part of its strategy to support Kyiv.
As a result of the sanctions, American officials estimate that Russia was forced to dramatically slow its production of missiles and other weaponry at the start of the war in February 2022 for at least six months. But by the end of 2022, Moscow's military industrial manufacturing began to pick up speed again, American officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose the sensitive assessment now concede.
Russia subverted American export controls using its intelligence services and ministry of defense to run illicit networks of people who smuggle key components by exporting them to other countries from which they can be shipped to Russia more easily. In less than a year since the war began, Russia rebuilt trade in critical components by routing them through countries like Armenia and Turkey. U.S. and European regulators have been trying to work together to curb the export of chips to Russia, but have struggled to stop the flow to pass through countries with ties to Moscow.
Russia's re-energized military production is especially worrisome because Moscow has used artillery to pound Ukrainian soldiers on the front lines, and its missiles to attack the electric grid and other critical infrastructure, and to terrorize civilians in cities. Officials fear that increased missile stocks could mean an especially dark and cold winter for Ukrainian citizens.
In the meantime, the Pentagon is working to find ways to help Ukrainians better take down the missiles and drones fired by Russia at civilian targets in Kyiv and military targets around the country. The Pentagon has provided Patriot air defense systems and cajoled allies to provide S-300 air defense ammunition, both of which have proven effective. It has also provided other air defenses like the Avenger system and the Hawk air defense system.
But Ukraine does not have enough air defense systems to cover the entire country, and must pick the sites it defends. An increased barrage of missiles could overwhelm the country's air defenses, Ukrainian officials said.
In October 2022, the United States gathered international officials in Washington in an effort to strengthen sanctions on the Russian economy. At the time, American officials said they believed the sanctions and export controls were working in part because they deterred countries from sending microchips, circuit boards, computer processors and other components needed for precision guided weaponry as well as necessary components for diesel engines, helicopters and tanks.
But Russia adapted quickly with its own efforts to secure supplies of the needed parts.
Today, Russian officials have remade their economy to focus on defense production. With revenue from high energy prices, Russia's security services and ministry of defense have been able to smuggle in the microelectronics and other Western materials required for cruise missiles and other precision guided weaponry. As a result, military production has not only recovered but surged.
Before the war, one senior Western defense official said, Russia could make 100 tanks a year; now they are producing 200.
Western officials also believe Russia is on track to manufacture two million artillery shells a year -- double the amount Western intelligence services had initially estimated Russia could manufacture before the war.
As a result of the push, Russia is now producing more ammunition than the United States and Europe. Overall, Kusti Salm, a senior Estonian defense ministry official, estimated that Russia's current ammunition production is seven times greater than that of the West.
Russia's production costs are also far lower than the West's, in part because Moscow is sacrificing safety and quality in its effort to build weapons more cheaply, Mr. Salm said. For instance, it costs a Western country $ 5,000 to $ 6,000 to make a 155-millimeter artillery round, whereas it costs Russia about $ 600 to produce a comparable 152-millimeter artillery shell, he said.
Still, Russia faces some shortcomings. It does not have huge inventories of missiles, though they have more of some kinds -- like the Kh-55 air-launched cruise missile -- in stock now than they did at the beginning of the war, according to people briefed on intelligence reports.
"In certain areas, they've been able to significantly ramp up production," said Dmitri Alperovitch, an international security expert and chairman of Silverado Policy Accelerator, a Washington-based think tank.
In cases where Russia needs millions of one particular component, export controls can grind production to a halt. But the chips needed to make a couple of hundred cruise missiles would fit into a few backpacks, which makes evading sanctions relatively simple, Mr. Alperovitch said.
American officials said they can slow, but not stop Russia from smuggling the parts it needs for missile production and that it was unrealistic to think Moscow would not react to the American curbs. One way Russia has adapted is by shipping components to third countries then diverting them there back to Russia, according to the Commerce Department.
"Because the controls were having a real impact, the Russian government didn't just throw up their hands and say, 'You got us, we give up,' " said Matthew S. Axelrod, the Commerce Department's assistance secretary for export enforcement. "They got more and more creative with their evasion attempts. And we have been really aggressively working a number of different ways to clamp down."
Currently, the United States and the European Union have a joint list of 38 different categories of items whose export to Russia is restricted. American officials said nine of the 38, mostly microelectronics that power missiles and drones, are the highest priority to block.
American and European officials have been working with banks to develop a warning system to alert governments to possible sanctions violations. So far American banks have alerted the U.S. government to 400 suspicious transactions. The Commerce Department has been able to use a third of those suspicious activity reports in its investigations.
On Aug. 31, the Commerce Department accused three people of taking part in an illicit Russian procurement network. One of the three, Arthur Petrov, a Russian-German national, was arrested and charged by the Justice Department with export control violations.
Mr. Petrov is accused of acquiring microelectronics from U.S.-based exporters for the purpose of sending them to Cyprus, Latvia or Tajikistan. Once there, other companies helped send the components onward, eventually making their way to Russia.
One of the challenges for the U.S. government is that Russia does not need higher-end chips that are easier to track, but commoditized chips that can be used in a wide range of things, not just guided missiles.
"It makes our job harder because there are a lot of countries that it's legal and totally fine to sell those chips to for legitimate commercial purposes," Mr. Axelrod said. "The problem is when those chips then get diverted and shipped to Russia."
American and Western officials say there is some good news. Russian production is still not keeping pace with how fast the military is burning through ammunition and wearing out equipment. For example, even though Russia is on pace to produce two million rounds of ammunition a year, it fired about 10 million rounds of artillery last year. That has led Moscow to desperately search for alternative sources to increase its stocks, most recently by trying to secure a weapons deal with North Korea, U.S. and Western officials said.
And although Moscow has been successful in smuggling processors and circuit boards, it is facing a shortage of rocket propellant and basic explosives, American officials said, material that can be harder to smuggle than circuit boards. Those shortages are likely to constrain Moscow if it tries to step up further production of ammunition, missiles or bombs.
Russia's increased military production has also come at a great cost to the Russian economy, particularly as interest rates spike in the country. Sanctions have taken a toll on the Russian economy's overall health, and overcoming Western export bans has not come cheaply, said American and Western officials. The senior Western defense official said that Russia had reallocated nearly a third of its commercial economy toward arms production. The country faces a labor shortage that could make further industrial gains harder to achieve too.
Russia cut back on its attacks on Ukraine's energy grid during the summer. But as temperatures plunge, some Ukrainian and Western analysts and government officials think Russia could renew the terror campaign on Kyiv, in hopes that it will sap Ukrainians' will to fight.
U.S. officials hope the steady supply of air defense ammunition and additional help to improve how Ukraine intercepts Russian attacks could help counter a reinforced barrage of missiles. And Ukrainian defenses have -- in some situations -- grown stronger.
"Ukrainians have become better in defending their infrastructure and building defenses around their power stations and critical power grids," Mr. Salm said. "They have become better at fixing and making sure that the impact of the power outages and other utility outages are not as harsh."

WASHINGTON — Russia has managed to overcome sanctions and export controls imposed by the West to expand its missile production beyond prewar levels, according to U.S., European and Ukrainian officials, leaving Ukraine especially vulnerable to intensified attacks in the coming months.
In addition to spending more than $40 billion providing weapons for Ukraine, the United States has made curbing Russia’s military supply a key part of its strategy to support Kyiv.
As a result of the sanctions, U.S. officials estimate that Russia was forced to dramatically slow its production of missiles and other weaponry at the start of the war in February 2022 for at least six months. But by the end of 2022, Moscow’s military industrial manufacturing began to pick up speed again, U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose the sensitive assessment now concede.
Russia subverted U.S. export controls using its intelligence services and ministry of defense to run illicit networks of people who smuggle key components by exporting them to other countries from which they can be shipped to Russia more easily. In less than a year since the war began, Russia rebuilt trade in critical components by routing them through countries including Armenia and Turkey. U.S. and European regulators have been trying to work together to curb the export of chips to Russia, but have struggled to stop the flow to pass through countries with ties to Moscow.
Russia’s reenergized military production is especially worrisome because Moscow has used artillery to pound Ukrainian soldiers on the front lines, and its missiles to attack the electric grid and other critical infrastructure, and to terrorize civilians in cities. Officials fear that increased missile stocks could mean an especially dark and cold winter for Ukrainian citizens.
In the meantime, the Pentagon is working to find ways to help Ukrainians better take down the missiles and drones fired by Russia at civilian targets in Kyiv and military targets around the country. The Pentagon has provided Patriot air defense systems and cajoled allies to provide S-300 air defense ammunition, both of which have proven effective. It has also provided other air defenses including the Avenger system and the Hawk air defense system.
But Ukraine does not have enough air defense systems to cover the entire country, and must pick the sites it defends. An increased barrage of missiles could overwhelm the country’s air defenses, Ukrainian officials said.
In October, the United States gathered international officials in Washington in an effort to strengthen sanctions on the Russian economy. At the time, U.S. officials said they believed the sanctions and export controls were working in part because they deterred countries from sending microchips, circuit boards, computer processors and other components needed for precision guided weaponry as well as necessary components for diesel engines, helicopters and tanks.
But Russia adapted quickly with its own efforts to secure supplies of the needed parts.
Today, Russian officials have remade their economy to focus on defense production. With revenue from high energy prices, Russia’s security services and ministry of defense have been able to smuggle in the microelectronics and other Western materials required for cruise missiles and other precision guided weaponry. As a result, military production has not only recovered but surged.
Before the war, one senior Western defense official said, Russia could make 100 tanks a year; now they are producing 200.
Western officials also believe Russia is on track to manufacture 2 million artillery shells a year — double the amount Western intelligence services had initially estimated Russia could manufacture before the war.
As a result of the push, Russia is producing more ammunition than the United States and Europe. Overall, Kusti Salm, a senior Estonian defense ministry official, estimated that Russia’s current ammunition production is seven times greater than that of the West.
Russia’s production costs are also far lower than the West’s, in part because Moscow is sacrificing safety and quality in its effort to build weapons more cheaply, Salm said. For instance, it costs a Western country $5,000 to $6,000 to make a 155 mm artillery round, whereas it costs Russia about $600 to produce a comparable 152 mm artillery shell, he said.
Still, Russia faces some shortcomings. It does not have huge inventories of missiles, though it has more of some kinds — such as the Kh-55 air-launched cruise missile — in stock now than it did at the beginning of the war, according to people briefed on intelligence reports.
“In certain areas, they’ve been able to significantly ramp up production,” said Dmitry Alperovitch, an international security expert and chair of Silverado Policy Accelerator, a Washington-based think tank.
In cases where Russia needs millions of one particular component, export controls can grind production to a halt. But the chips needed to make a couple of hundred cruise missiles would fit into a few backpacks, which makes evading sanctions relatively simple, Alperovitch said.
U.S. officials said they can slow, but not stop Russia from smuggling the parts it needs for missile production and that it was unrealistic to think Moscow would not react to the American curbs. One way Russia has adapted is by shipping components to third countries then diverting them there back to Russia, according to the Commerce Department.
“Because the controls were having a real impact, the Russian government didn’t just throw up their hands and say, ‘You got us, we give up,’ ” said Matthew Axelrod, the Commerce Department’s assistance secretary for export enforcement. “They got more and more creative with their evasion attempts. And we have been really aggressively working a number of different ways to clamp down.”
The United States and the European Union have a joint list of 38 different categories of items whose export to Russia is restricted. U.S. officials said nine of the 38, mostly microelectronics that power missiles and drones, are the highest priority to block.
U.S. and European officials have been working with banks to develop a warning system to alert governments to possible sanctions violations. So far, American banks have alerted the U.S. government to 400 suspicious transactions. The Commerce Department has been able to use a third of those suspicious activity reports in its investigations.
On Aug. 31, the Commerce Department accused three people of taking part in an illicit Russian procurement network. One of the three, Arthur Petrov, a Russian-German national, was arrested and charged by the Justice Department with export control violations.
Petrov is accused of acquiring microelectronics from U.S.-based exporters for the purpose of sending them to Cyprus, Latvia or Tajikistan. Once there, other companies helped send the components onward, eventually making their way to Russia.
One of the challenges for the U.S. government is that Russia does not need higher-end chips that are easier to track, but commoditized chips that can be used in a wide range of things, not just guided missiles.
“It makes our job harder because there are a lot of countries that it’s legal and totally fine to sell those chips to for legitimate commercial purposes,” Axelrod said. “The problem is when those chips then get diverted and shipped to Russia.”
U.S. and Western officials say there is some good news. Russian production is still not keeping pace with how fast the military is burning through ammunition and wearing out equipment. For example, even though Russia is on pace to produce 2 million rounds of ammunition a year, it fired about 10 million rounds of artillery last year. That has led Moscow to desperately search for alternative sources to increase its stocks, most recently by trying to secure a weapons deal with North Korea, U.S. and Western officials said.
And although Moscow has been successful in smuggling processors and circuit boards, it is facing a shortage of rocket propellant and basic explosives, U.S. officials said, material that can be harder to smuggle than circuit boards. Those shortages are likely to constrain Moscow if it tries to step up further production of ammunition, missiles or bombs.
Russa’s increased military production has also come at a great cost to the Russian economy, particularly as interest rates spike there. Sanctions have taken a toll on the Russian economy’s overall health, and overcoming Western export bans has not come cheaply, said U.S. and Western officials. The senior Western defense official said that Russia had reallocated nearly a third of its commercial economy toward arms production. The country faces a labor shortage that could make further industrial gains harder to achieve, too.
Russia cut back on its attacks on Ukraine’s energy grid during the summer. But as temperatures plunge, some Ukrainian and Western analysts and government officials think Russia could renew the terror campaign on Kyiv, in hopes that it will sap Ukrainians’ will to fight.
U.S. officials hope the steady supply of air defense ammunition and additional help to improve how Ukraine intercepts Russian attacks could help counter a reinforced barrage of missiles. And Ukrainian defenses have — in some situations — grown stronger.
“Ukrainians have become better in defending their infrastructure and building defenses around their power stations and critical power grids,” Salm said. “They have become better at fixing and making sure that the impact of the power outages and other utility outages are not as harsh.”

Full text: A googol, the number for which Google is named, is a 1 followed by 100 zeros. At $ 1.7 trillion, the company's valuation is far from that large, but it's closer than the market cap of almost every other tech competitor.
The biggest U.S. antitrust case in 25 years, set to begin this week, strikes at the heart of the empire that Alphabet, Google's parent company, built over decades.
Alphabet hit a $ 1 trillion market cap in January 2020, a milestone that only Apple, Amazon and Microsoft have also reached. At the time, Alphabet was facing several different legal and regulatory challenges -- but this latest court battle is its most significant yet.
Google will go head to head with the Justice Department and a group of states, which argue that the tech giant illegally abused its agreements with phone makers and browsers to become the default search engine, quashing its rivals.
Those monopolistic practices are how Google got so big, the government says, as the company became synonymous with looking up information on the web. Google has cornered 90 percent of the search engine market in the United States and 91 percent globally, according to one data analysis firm.
At the helm of Google's legal strategy is Kent Walker, a top lawyer at the company for almost 20 years. He says he will argue that Google's partnerships with companies like Apple and Samsung are lawful and that consumers should have easy access to the services they like most.
But if Google loses the case, the company could be forced to pay damages and limit its search distribution deals, leading to fewer users and a drop in its robust profits. And not only could a ruling against Google sap it of its power and influence, the case could also have a ripple effect on other large internet companies that have enjoyed decades of almost unfettered growth.

Today, You Are More or Less an Adult: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: The Jewish ceremony can be the setting for a sharp look at growing up. But it has too often been used for glosses that ignore the rite's deeper meaning.
In the Jewish faith you become an adult at the most awkward possible moment: when you turn 13. Sure, in the eyes of God and your Hebrew school, you are mature enough to read from the Torah and embrace the responsibilities of grown-up life. But in reality you're probably a scared kid for whom true maturity is far off, despite all those uncomfortable hormones.
That was the case when I was bat mitzvahed in 2003 -- mortifyingly (but also with a hint of pride) getting my first period shortly before the event -- and that's the case in the new Netflix film "You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah," based on the 2005 young adult novel by Fiona Rosenbloom.
The movie, directed by Sammi Cohen, is the story of Stacy Friedman, played by Sunny Sandler. (Sunny is the daughter of Adam Sandler, who plays her dad in the film. Her real life-sister, Sadie, has been cast as her movie sibling, Ronnie. Their mother, Jackie Sandler, also in the cast, portrays a different girl's mom -- the role of Stacy's mom went to Idina Menzel, who played Adam's wife in "Uncut Gems." Got all that?)
Stacy has long dreamed of a blowout bat mitzvah alongside her best friend, Lydia Rodriguez Katz (Samantha Lorraine), but the messy realities of middle school meddle with their party plans. There are ill-advised crushes, moments of embarrassing flirtation and the kind of humiliating cruelty that only a 13-year-old with a grudge can muster. Eventually, Stacy takes the bimah at her bat mitzvah to read her Torah portion, and she learns the kinds of life lessons that come when you've emerged from the navel-gazing cocoon of youth.
"You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah" proves, as other movies and shows have before it, that when a bar or bat mitzvah is depicted onscreen, it can often be a savvy vessel for exploring the funny, strange or even traumatic transition from childhood to teenagedom.
"Figuring out, who am I, who I want to be -- such a Jewish experience," Cohen, who uses they/them pronouns, told me in an interview, adding that it's "also just a human experience."
"We don't all have a bat mitzvah," they continued, "but we all feel awkward when we have to step out in front of our friends and family and try not to make a mistake."
At the same time, Hollywood can get too caught up in the lavish spectacle of these affairs, with depictions that sap them of their cultural or emotional significance in favor of gags about the superficiality of the post-service party. The spoiled bar or bat mitzvah boy or girl is a trope that comes up repeatedly. In a 2000 "Sex and the City" episode, Samantha (Kim Cattrall) faces off against a rich brat (Kat Dennings) who is hiring a publicist for her bat mitzvah party. "I want it all, I want it now, and I want you to get it for me," the girl says.
During a 2012 episode of "30 Rock," Tracy (Tracy Morgan) and Jenna (Jane Krakowski) humiliate themselves at a bar mitzvah playing Transformer robots for the demanding son of their accountant. The films "Starsky & Hutch" (2004) and "Safe Men" (1998) found gags in criminals attending bat and bar mitzvahs.
The b'nai mitzvah party gone wild -- celebrating a bat or bar mitzvah -- is another staple of the genre. "Keeping Up With the Steins" (2006), directed by Scott Marshall, starts from a place of absurdity with an outlandish "Titanic" movie-themed soirée attended by the Fiedler family. The dad, an "Entourage"-era Jeremy Piven essentially playing a flavor of Ari Gold, does all he can to match the grandiosity of that event for his son. In the process he reconnects with his own father (Garry Marshall), a reunion facilitated by his child (Daryl Sabara). It's a thin narrative that uses the hook of the over-the-top bar mitzvah for a trite family tale.
Financial anxiety is a feature of similar narratives, and it is possible to find nuance in the strange mix of faith and capitalism that b'nai mitzvah spur in Jewish American culture -- mostly when the writers, directors and performers lean into what a confusing time it is for the teenagers for whom these ceremonies are ostensibly intended.
The Hulu series "Pen15" is a masterpiece of discomfort -- augmented by the fact that its creators and stars, Anna Konkle and Maya Erskine, are 30-something actors playing 13-year-olds in middle school. Their characters are not Jewish, but the gawky unease they cultivate is on full display during the episode chronicling the bat mitzvah of a popular girl named Becca (Sami Rappoport), a moment that coincides with their class learning about the Holocaust. The lesson about genocide makes Anna (Konkle) contemplate the very existence of God. The occasion brings on a different kind of unease for Maya (Erskine), who is desperate to impress Becca with a fancy gift despite the fact that it's a stretch for her parents. "Pen15," which takes place in the early 2000s, nails the cringe-worthy elements of bat mitzvah-going, whether it's Becca entering her party belting a song from "Damn Yankees" or the mechanical slow dancing. But at the same time it explores how fraught the tradition can be when it comes to social class.
Still, the episode focuses on an outsider's experience of a bat mitzvah, not an actual Jew's. So does Cooper Raiff's 2022 directorial effort, "Cha Cha Real Smooth," in which he also stars. It's a bar mitzvah movie with thin acknowledgment of Jewish tradition. Raiff's aimless college grad Andrew -- who is not Jewish -- gets a job as a party starter for b'nai mitzvah receptions. It's a good backdrop for Andrew's own insecurities; he knows just as little about life as the much younger people around him. But it's also just that: a backdrop.
To find a movie that incorporates a bar mitzvah in the fabric of its Jewishness, look to the Coen brothers' "A Serious Man" (2009), a chronicle of Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg), a professor in 1967 Minnesota. Larry's son Danny (Aaron Wolff) gets extremely stoned before his bar mitzvah. It's the kind of stupid thing a little twerp would do, but the disorienting way the Coens film this sequence -- with fuzzy visuals and oblique angles -- feels like an introduction to a faith of questioning that can itself be disorienting, especially as Danny meets with the aged Rabbi Marshak (Alan Mandell), who starts reciting Jefferson Airplane's "Somebody to Love" as a prayer.
For an even bleaker depiction, there's Todd Solondz's "Life During Wartime" (2010), where the bar mitzvah of Timmy (Dylan Riley Snyder) coincides with horrific realizations about his father. Timmy's perception of becoming a man, as he describes in a speech he's writing for the occasion, is standing up for yourself even if it means getting "just plain tortured." Solondz's view is clear: Growing up is pain. There's less of an engagement with the nature of Judaism here than there is in "A Serious Man," but Solondz scores sequences with Avinu Malkeinu, a Jewish prayer of repentance usually uttered on the High Holy Days, which serves as a reminder of the human failure on which the director fixates.
It's hard to get darker than what Solondz delivers, but even some of the cheeriest b'nai mitzvah stories can have a touch of the grim. In "You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah," Stacy lashes out at Lydia over a boy, spreading gossip about her and making an embarrassing video that ends up being played on Lydia's big night. Her petulant acts may seem minor but they have real stakes, as anyone who has ever been betrayed by a friend knows. "Real kids are complicated and messy," Cohen told me.
And it's true. I have warmly nostalgic memories of my own bat mitzvah that are mixed up with more complicated feelings. I think about a connection to faith that I let lapse and relatives who are no longer alive. I think about the friends with whom I have lost touch. I remember the world in front of me and it being exciting but also so scary. That's the thematic potential in a b'nai mitzvah, and it's nice to see that occasionally filmmakers get it right.

After Two Years, Biles Is at Peace And Back on Top: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In her second elite meet following a two-year hiatus, Biles, 26, won a record eighth U.S. all-around title and became the oldest gymnast to win the championship.
By now, it's canon that Simone Biles is the greatest gymnast of all time. The debate over that status largely ended years ago, when she began pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the sport.
Her consistency is also unmatched. Since 2013, Biles has earned 32 world championship and Olympic medals, even after removing herself from several finals at the Tokyo Games in 2021 to safeguard her health. The question usually isn't whether Biles will win but rather by how much.
The answer at the U.S. Gymnastics Championships on Sunday was a margin of 3.9 points over the silver medalist, Shilese Jones. Biles's victory also meant that she broke a 90-year record by becoming the first American gymnast, woman or man, to win eight national all-around titles. And, at 26, she is the oldest woman to ever win the event.
The national championships came just weeks after her return to elite competition following a two-year hiatus. She handily won a qualifying meet called the U.S. Classic earlier this month in Hoffman Estates, Ill. At the SAP Center in San Jose on Sunday, among a crowded and talented field, Biles looked better than ever.
That perhaps could partially be chalked up to her attitude: "It's just gymnastics," she has told her younger teammates. Keeping with her relaxed demeanor, Biles hasn't explicitly said that she is seeking to compete at the Paris Olympics next summer.
"Personal goals and stuff, I think sometimes it's OK to keep it to ourself, just so that nobody can throw it in your face -- 'Oh well, this was your goal and you didn't hit it,"' Biles said after the competition. "I'm kind of at the age where it's like, yo, just let me be at peace. So one thing at a time."
On Friday, the first night of competition, Biles was close to flawless. Her two wobbles on beam and a step out of bounds on floor exercise were overshadowed by her nearly sticking the landing on a Yurchenko double pike vault, a skill so daunting that no other woman and only a few men attempt it. The move -- she launches herself into two flips with her legs straightened in a 90-degree angle -- scored a weekend high of 15.700, even with a half-point deduction. She incurred the penalty because one of her coaches, Laurent Landi, had stood on the podium and beside the apparatus for her safety.
Biles didn't display the double pike in warm-ups or in competition on Sunday, opting to show just one tough vault called a Cheng. Landi said that Biles stung an ankle on the skill on Friday and that there was no reason for her to repeat it just for show.
The other events -- uneven bars, beam and floor exercise -- were quintessential Biles: incredible height and speed, and a few small hops on landings. The loudest cheers of the competition, and a standing ovation, came when she clinched the championship with an impressive 15.400 on floor. Landi called it "the best floor routine I've ever seen her do."
Biles's sole bronze medal came on bars, which is her weakest event only because she is so phenomenal everywhere else. Her choice to forgo a second vault on the final day of competition meant she wasn't eligible for a medal there.
Biles acknowledged that she had nerves going into every event, but that she felt capable and prepared because she was training more efficiently. "Age helps," she said. "I can't afford to, like, go in the gym and have all those hours."
When asked what two words described her feelings after the championships, she decided on "happy" and "hungry" for dinner. "Happy that it's over," she added, and "happy that I'm back out here competing."
For the most invested gymnastics fans, 2023 has been a banner season so far. These championships included four members of the Tokyo team -- Biles, Jade Carey, Jordan Chiles and Sunisa Lee -- and two Tokyo alternates, Kayla DiCello and Leanne Wong. Jones, the silver medalist in the all-around at the 2022 world championships, and Skye Blakely, who placed fourth in the all-around on Sunday, are clearly hitting their stride.
Gabby Douglas, the 2012 Olympic all-around champion, has indicated that she'll return to competition as well.
At times on Sunday, it felt dizzying to keep track of every twist and flip because gymnasts perform on four apparatuses simultaneously. Jones, who recently said that she's coming back from a torn labrum in her shoulder and from ankle issues, had a particularly strong beam routine to repeat as the U.S. all-around silver medalist. Wong, who competes in college for Florida, placed third and had some of her best landings ever on floor.
All of the top women could be among the five gymnasts and one alternate selected to represent the United States in just five weeks at the world championships in Belgium. A separate team selection camp will determine the U.S. delegation, meaning that gymnasts like Lee, Carey and Chiles, who made uncharacteristic mistakes this weekend, are still in contention for spots.
Lee, who is the reigning Olympic all-around champion and had recently competed for Auburn, is coming back from kidney problems and performed only on vault and beam. She fell off the beam on Friday but recovered on Sunday to end up third on the apparatus.
Carey, the floor exercise champion in Tokyo who competes for Oregon State, had falls on beam both nights and finished a distant 15th in the all-around.

Kyiv Is Aiming Drones At Russia, but Message Is for Ukraine's People: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: U.S. officials say they expect Ukraine to continue its attacks because they send a strong message: Kyiv can still strike back.
Ukraine has increased its frequency of drone attacks on Russia in recent weeks, a tactic U.S. officials say is intended to demonstrate to the Ukrainian public that Kyiv can still strike back, especially as the counteroffensive against entrenched Russian troops moves slowly.
Over the past week, Ukrainian drones near Moscow forced the Kremlin to temporarily shut down airports serving the capital. And on Friday, the Russian Ministry of Defense said Ukraine had launched 42 drones at the occupied Crimean Peninsula and fired a missile that was intercepted not far from Moscow, in what could be one of the biggest known aerial assaults on Russian-held territory since the war began.
Throughout the summer, the intensifying strikes -- many of which have been carried out with Ukrainian-made drones -- have hit a building in central Moscow, an international airport and a supersonic bomber stationed south of St. Petersburg.
Although the attacks destroyed the bomber, they have done little significant damage to Russia's overall military might, U.S. officials have said. No Russians have been killed in the strikes on Moscow, most of which occurred early in the day, reducing damage and disruption. The timing may be for operational security or to avoid Russia's air defenses, but it has also helped ensure that the attacks did not prompt escalatory attacks by Russia.
Andriy Yusov, a spokesman for Ukraine's military intelligence service, known as the G.U.R., did not directly claim responsibility for the attacks, but he said strikes on Moscow would continue.
"Russian elites and ordinary Russians now understand that war is not somewhere far away on the territory of Ukraine, which they hate," Mr. Yusov said in an interview last month, as the drone campaign began to intensify. "War is also in Moscow, it's already on their territory."
But U.S. officials say there is a more important audience. If there is a strategic target, it is to bolster the morale of Ukraine's population and troops, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information.
Ukraine began a counteroffensive in June against Russian forces occupying its south and east. But unlike the push last summer, during which Ukrainian forces quickly retook land outside Kharkiv, they have found it harder to break through Russia's fortified defenses and incurred heavy losses in equipment and troops.
Without appreciable progress to demonstrate on the battlefield, Ukraine has intensified its drone attacks in Crimea, in cross-border strikes and deep into Russia.
Ukrainian officials said they had some hope that stepped-up attacks could force Moscow to reconsider its far more extensive and damaging missile and drone strikes on Ukraine.
But so far, the campaign appears to have strengthened support for the war in some parts of Russia, though it may have also helped undermine faith in the government, at least in elite circles, said Tatiana Stanovaya, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
"The Ukrainians do what they can in their current circumstances," said Ms. Stanovaya, who based her assessment on reporting and conversations with people in Russia. "I don't think they are trying to have a strategic effect."
In Russian border regions, the drone strikes appear to have bolstered anti-Ukraine sentiment and may help strengthen President Vladimir V. Putin's standing, Ms. Stanovaya said. "It fuels fears among Russians that they are vulnerable, they can be attacked, so they have to support Putin," she said.
But in a recent article in Foreign Affairs, Ms. Stanovaya argued there were signs -- at least among wealthy elites -- of doubts about Mr. Putin's strength after the rebellion by the mercenary Wagner group. The intensifying Ukrainian drone strikes may be contributing to those doubts.
U.S. intelligence agencies are unsure which operatives in the Ukrainian military are carrying out the attacks. Though he has not mentioned the strikes specifically, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has said the war is returning to Russian territory.
Ukraine has used a mix of short- and long-range drones to conduct the strikes, according to U.S. officials. A New York Times investigation last month found that three types of long-range drones made in Ukraine had been used in the attacks on Russia, including the Moscow region. Those drones were launched from Ukraine, U.S. officials said. The short-range ones are likely to be operated by pro-Ukrainian sympathizers or operatives who slipped across the border. Some of the drones were built in Ukraine, the officials said, while others might have been assembled in the field. In either case, the United States believes the attacks were most likely ordered and loosely directed by elements in the Ukrainian government.
U.S. officials said the cross-border strikes were not carried out using American equipment.
The first major strike in Moscow -- in early May, when drones exploded over the Kremlin -- was possibly halted by Russian air defenses. In July and August, several more strikes have occurred in and around Moscow.
Despite the limited effect of the attacks, U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said they expected Ukraine would continue to strike in Russia because it sent a strong message: Kyiv was not simply defending its territory but also had some ability to take the fight to Russia.
Earlier in the war, U.S. officials had warned of the possibility that Ukrainian drone strikes on Moscow could prove escalatory, giving Mr. Putin an excuse to intensify Russian attacks on civilian targets. But U.S. officials conceded that attempted Ukrainian strikes had so far been calibrated, and they had not provoked any drastic escalation by Moscow.
Ukrainian officials said the drone strikes posed little risk of escalation because Russia could not further intensify its fight given that it was already firing as many missiles and drones at Ukraine as it could.
Analysts said the drone attacks had propelled the Russian propaganda machine into action. State-run media in Russia has sought to blunt the impact of Ukraine's drones by emphasizing the military's ability to shoot them down, an attempt to send a message that its defenses were strong and the Ukrainian strikes ineffective.
"The narratives that are coming out of Russian media, reflective of how the Kremlin is trying to narrate it, are referring to drones shot down, not drone attacks," said Jonathan D. Teubner, the chief executive of FilterLabs, a company that tracks public sentiment in Russia. "They have been communicating, 'We have shot down another Ukrainian-Western-American drone, look what we've done."'
Mr. Teubner said his company's studies of Russian sentiment, which use computer models to analyze comments on Telegram, social media, local messaging groups and other sources, show the population is largely fed up and disgusted with the military leadership in Moscow, especially after Yevgeny V. Prigozhin's attempted rebellion in June.
While the abortive mutiny has helped accentuate public skepticism of a draft in Russia, it has not yet turned ordinary Russians against the war, Mr. Teubner said. But the drone strikes, combined with the aftermath of the rebellion, may have increased the view among Moscow's elites that the Russian government could be more frail than it seems.
U.S. intelligence officials had predicted for weeks that Mr. Putin would not allow Mr. Prigozhin's mutiny to go unanswered, in part because to do so could undermine the public's view of the Russian government. U.S. and Western officials said they believed Mr. Putin had ordered the destruction of Mr. Prigozhin's plane. The crash appears to have killed the mercenary leader.
For now, U.S. officials say it is important not to overstate the effect the drone strikes are having on Russian public opinion.
Russia has executed a similar tactic, but with a far larger barrage of attacks that have far more lethal consequences. Since last fall, Russia has used Iranian drones and its own cruise missiles to strike apartment buildings, power stations and other civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.
Those attacks, which have killed scores, are part of a campaign by Russian forces who hope the strikes will sap the will of Ukrainians to resist the invasion, U.S. officials said.
Yet despite widespread damage, the Russian strikes have had a limited impact at best on Ukraine's military might and its will to fight. Even the strikes on the electric grid have had only transitory effects. In the largest cities of Ukraine, power was restored after Russian attacks on the electric grid in six hours on average, an analysis by Microsoft showed. In other areas, power was restored in 3.3 days.
Military commands often justify strategic bombing campaigns on civilian populations as a way to break the enemy's will to fight. But such attacks backfire more often than they succeed, U.S. military officials said. Germany's attacks on London during World War II, for example, hardened Britain's resolve.
"There is very mixed data over whether bombing a civilian population changes their attitude in the way you want it to be changed," Mr. Teubner said. "In the London Blitz, the Brits didn't turn to Churchill and say, 'We don't want bombs coming down.' It had the opposite effect of what the Nazis wanted."
U.S. officials said some Ukrainian officials understood that just as Russia's attacks on Kyiv would only strengthen Ukraine's resolve, Ukraine's attacks on Moscow were unlikely to turn Russians against the war.
Instead, the symbolic strikes are meant to give heart to Ukrainians who may be anxious about the slow progress of the counteroffensive, buying time for Mr. Zelensky and his forces in the coming weeks.

Julian Barry, Who Made Lenny Bruce Into 'Lenny,' Is Dead at 92: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mr. Barry's scripts for a hit Broadway play and later a Hollywood movie about that rule-breaking comic helped give Mr. Bruce a lasting place in pop culture lore.
Julian Barry, whose scripts for a Broadway play and a Hollywood movie about Lenny Bruce, both titled "Lenny," became definitive portraits of the comedian as a truth teller who drove himself mad in a righteous struggle against American hypocrisy, was found dead on Tuesday morning at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 92.
His daughter Julia Barry said he had died overnight in his sleep. He had been receiving medical treatment for congestive heart failure and, in recent weeks, for late-stage kidney disease.
Like Marilyn Monroe and John Lennon, Mr. Bruce died young (he was 40) and became a figure of continually renewed pop-culture lore. His comedy career and his criminal prosecutions on drug and obscenity charges inspired museum exhibitions, one-man theatrical performances and biographies. From 2017 until this year, a fictionalized version of Mr. Bruce was a recurring character on the Amazon Prime television show "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel."
Mr. Barry's play, which opened on Broadway in 1971, five years after Mr. Bruce's death, proved that Mr. Bruce could draw an audience posthumously. The 1974 movie version, which starred Dustin Hoffman in the title role, has endured as a classic of the Lenny Bruce mini-genre. It earned six Academy Award nominations, including for best picture, best actor and best adapted screenplay. (Mr. Barry lost to Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo for "The Godfather Part II.")
In both scripts, Mr. Barry paid homage to Mr. Bruce by including lengthy passages of his stand-up comedic material. His Lenny Bruce is crude but winningly so -- more forgiving human frailty than mocking it, and skillful in using earthy common sense to attack the prejudices of his day.
Clive Barnes of The New York Times called the play a "dynamite shtick" of theater, and reflected on the irony that Mr. Bruce had been arrested after using language in nightclubs that by 1971 seemed unexceptional when declaimed from a Broadway stage. "The last laugh," he concluded, "is with Mr. Bruce."
The Broadway star of "Lenny," Cliff Gorman, won the 1972 Tony Award for lead actor in a play. As Mr. Gorman told The Times in an interview after the play opened, his performance roused Mr. Bruce's mother, Sally Marr, to visit his dressing room and address him as a "genius."
Mr. Barry's script compared Mr. Bruce to Aristophanes and Jonathan Swift. Some people rolled their eyes.
"The story Julian Barry has extracted from Bruce's life tends to sanctify and, in the end, even to solemnize Bruce rather than to explore his obsessions," another Times theater critic, Mel Gussow, wrote in a 1972 review, when Sandy Baron replaced Mr. Gorman.
But Mr. Barry found a powerful fan in Bob Fosse. After directing the movie version of the Broadway musical "Cabaret" (1972), for which he won the Academy Award for best director, Mr. Fosse decided that he wanted "Lenny" to be his next film project. He hired Mr. Barry to write the script.
"In the play, I mythologized Lenny Bruce," Mr. Barry told Rolling Stone in 1974. In contrast, he said, the movie offered "a cold, objective approach."
Mr. Barry was perhaps referring to the film's depiction of Mr. Bruce's decline -- ranting onstage about his arrests, shooting heroin, speechifying pathetically in court and finally dying of a morphine overdose naked on his bathroom floor in Los Angeles.
Yet in "Lenny," filmed in arty black and white, Mr. Bruce's flaws are redeemed. He cheats on his wife, but he shows himself to be faithful to her when she needs him most. His idealism about racial slurs -- that by using them people can sap them of their malign power -- goes unquestioned. His enemies in the legal system do not explain their defense of conservative social mores.
Mr. Barry saw Mr. Bruce as a tragic hero.
"The whole beauty of Lenny," he told Rolling Stone, "is his message: We're all the same schmuck."
Julian Barry Mendelsohn Jr. was born on Dec. 24, 1930, in the Bronx and grew up in the Riverdale neighborhood. His father struggled as a salesman during the Depression but eventually rose to become an executive at the Hudson Pulp and Paper Company. His mother, Grace (Fein) Mendelsohn, donated time and money to Jewish causes and the theater.
Julian began acting as a teenager while attending Horace Mann, a day school in Riverdale, where, he wrote in his memoir, "My Night With Orson" (2011), he was a "townie" -- not as privileged as wealthier fellow students who lived in uptown Manhattan. Believing it would aid a future career in show business -- and following the advice of Philip Burton, a British director who taught at a summer acting camp that Julian attended -- he modified his name to sound less Jewish while still just a teenager.
He was briefly an undergraduate at Syracuse University and Emerson College in Massachusetts. After serving in the Army and fighting in Korea in his early 20s, he established a career as a Broadway stage manager. He then took a risk at the age of 35, turning down steady work to focus on writing.
Mr. Barry found success in television writing scripts in the 1960s for popular shows like "Mission: Impossible." His first screenplay to be filmed was "Rhinoceros" (1974), an adaptation of Eugène Ionesco's play, starring Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder.
Mr. Barry's four marriages ended in divorce. In addition to his daughter Julia, from his third marriage, to the film producer Laura Ziskin, he is survived by his longtime partner, Samantha Harper Macy; two daughters, Sally and Jennifer Barry, from his second marriage, to Patricia Foley; a son, Michael, also from that marriage; five grandchildren; and one great-grandson.
In his autobiography, Mr. Barry described years of meeting stars and starlets. He and Frank Sinatra spent hours telling old stories and imagining a movie they might make together.
Summing up his life in the mid-1980s, he wrote, "I was still bumming a ride on my Academy nomination."
Yet project after project of his did not get made, lost in the Hollywood purgatory known as "development."
To some extent, Mr. Barry wrote, it was his own fault for becoming too hip for his own good. He grew his hair long, and he name-dropped in the offhand style of a "Hollywood Phony," he wrote. Discussing a script of his with Robert Redford and the director Sydney Pollack in Mr. Redford's hotel room, he suddenly lit up a joint. He was later told that the two men did not like him.
"I had to live up to my reputation," Mr. Barry recalled, "as the man who wrote about Lenny Bruce."

Don't Let Inflation Eclipse a Government Triumph: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The recession caused by the Covid-19 pandemic was the shortest on record, thanks to rapid, robust and bipartisan congressional action. It took just over two years to regain all of the jobs lost -- hard to fathom given that more than six million people filed unemployment insurance claims in one week at the end of March 2020. Americans were made whole by their government, which staved off what otherwise would have been mass financial suffering.
"This is the best, most successful response to an economic crisis that we have ever mounted, and it is not even close," H. Luke Shaefer, a professor at the University of Michigan who is an expert on deep poverty, told a House committee in the fall of 2021.
But by the time Dr. Shaefer testified, inflation had begun to rise, sucking all the air out of the room. As the economic conversation turned to inflation and its causes (and remained there), the debate shifted from what the government achieved to whether it went too far. Inflation hawks blamed the pandemic response for driving up consumer demand, which, in their telling, drove up prices, causing pain for many people as the cost of food, rent and other necessities rose.
The fracas over inflation risks memory-holing the concrete proof that the federal government is fully capable of keeping Americans afloat when the economy sinks. "We showed that we could do it, this is what we should be doing from now on," J.W. Mason, an economist at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, told me. The open question, now, is whether we'll ever do it again.
In fact, the Federal Reserve is actively working to undo many of the government's accomplishments. To fight inflation, the Fed has been raising interest rates in the hope they will make businesses pull back, spending less on wages and hiring fewer people (or even firing a bunch of them) and cooling demand. Even as inflation has fallen this year, the agency is widely expected to announce another rate increase next week and may very well keep raising rates later this year.
When the pandemic began in March 2020, the federal government responded at lightning speed. Five days after declaring a national emergency, President Donald Trump signed the bipartisan Families First Coronavirus Response Act on March 18. Less than two weeks later he signed the similarly bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act.
Together, the packages sent out about $ 2 trillion through $ 600 extra in weekly unemployment benefits and expanded eligibility, $ 1,200 stimulus checks, and more food assistance. That December, Congress provided $ 900 billion more through the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, which included $ 300 in weekly unemployment benefits and stimulus checks of $ 600. In March 2021, with Joe Biden in the White House and Democrats in control of the Senate, Democrats passed $ 1.9 trillion through the American Rescue Plan, which included another round of stimulus checks, an expanded child tax credit, and rental assistance. In all, the relief was more than three times as much as what was offered during the Great Recession in 2007.
Results came quickly, too. The pandemic recession lasted for just two months. Unemployment hit 14.7 percent in April 2020 but fell to single digits within four months. The unemployment rate has stayed below 4 percent since the beginning of 2022. The share of employed Americans in their prime working years recently reached its prepandemic peak. "We haven't really seen any jobs recovery at this pace," Arindrajit Dube, an economist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, told me.
There are other ways to measure success. Amid staggeringly high unemployment, poverty actually fell to the lowest level on record in 2020 and then fell again in 2021. Hunger remained flat.
Hardship was averted thanks to government aid that helped replace lost income. But as the economy swiftly recovered, Americans also started to earn more, especially those making the least. Wage growth for people earning in the bottom 10 percent rose 6.4 percent between January 2020 and this past September. "That really flips the script for what's happened in the last 40 years," Dr. Dube said. Typically, low-wage workers see the biggest job losses in a recession, which translates to higher joblessness and lower wage growth. But not this time. Low-wage workers did suffer big job losses in the pandemic, but their wage growth was higher in this recession than in each of the last four.
Wage growth has been so strong for those who earn the least, in fact, that income inequality actually shrank. Inequality has generally expanded since the 1980s, but the robust wage growth in the wake of the pandemic has erased over a quarter of the gap between the lowest and highest paid. "This is not the type of change we see often," Dr. Dube said.
It's hard to know exactly what the counterfactual would have looked and felt like, how deep and wide the hole would have been without powerful congressional action. But Moody's Analytics estimates that without federal aid, economic output would have fallen three times further in 2020 and we would have experienced a double-dip recession the following year. Jobs wouldn't have recovered until 2026 and unemployment would have stayed in the double digits well into 2021. Wage growth would have crawled along at a record low. Poverty would have hit record highs.
We also have the very recent experience of the Great Recession to compare it to. "My biggest takeaway from the incredible success of the labor market recovery from the pandemic recession was that the jobless recovery that followed the Great Recession was a policy choice -- a cruel and misguided policy choice," said Lindsay Owens, the executive director of the liberal think tank Groundwork Collaborative.
In December 2008, Christina Romer, the incoming chair of President-elect Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, estimated that a federal stimulus package should be more than $ 1.2 trillion to prevent mass unemployment. Larry Summers, who would soon be director of the National Economic Council, shot down the idea. The package that passed was $ 787 billion. Just two years later Mr. Obama sought a "grand bargain" on deficit reduction. His eventual deal exchanged dollar-for-dollar federal spending cuts for increasing the debt ceiling, which shaved points off gross domestic product and sapped jobs from an economy still struggling to recover.
The unemployment rate hit double digits in October 2009 and stayed above its pre-recession rate for nearly eight years. Prime-age employment wouldn't hit its pre-recession high-water mark until January 2019. Food insecurity climbed from 11.1 percent of households in 2007 to 14.7 percent in 2009. Wage growth remained stagnant for a decade.
The labor market was so soft that Americans were desperate for employment and workers got trapped in bad jobs. It was particularly painful for young people, who were stuck on a broken escalator to better employment, leaving "a sizable negative impact on an entire generation," Dr. Dube said.
If the goal was keeping inflation low, the government did great -- it stayed depressed for many years. But so did job and wage growth. Americans did "poorly" in spite of "really, really low inflation," said Michael Madowitz, director of macroeconomic policy at the left-leaning Washington Center for Equitable Growth. It was a "lost decade."
It's clear the government mounted a far more successful response in the pandemic. But the victory lap was cut short. At first, businesses and conservatives started complaining that by being too generous, the government had caused too many Americans to give up. "No one wants to work anymore," whined employers whose employees left for better jobs. That story never held up, especially given how many studies have found that more generous unemployment benefits did not cause people to stop working, nor did taking them away push them into jobs.
Then when inflation started to rise in 2021, the concern turned to the idea that federal relief was fueling it. Americans had too much government largess in their bank accounts, the reasoning went, so they were buying too many goods and services, driving prices up. Strong wage growth was only fueling the fire.
But that story doesn't quite hold up, either. When Dr. Dube and co-authors examined this question, they found that while the tight labor market had some impact on inflation, it accounted for only about a fifth of the rise in non-energy prices. Had the sole factor affecting inflation been the tight labor market and subsequent higher wages, inflation would have been just 2.3 percent by late 2022. The economists Andrea Cerrato and Giulia Gitti came to a similar conclusion, finding that higher demand in the recovery could explain only a quarter of the increase in overall inflation.
The whole idea was always a bit ridiculous: "How did $ 1200 stimulus checks cause inflation in Turkey?" Dr. Owens noted. "It probably didn't."
Still, plenty of people have used high inflation to chide the government for doing too much. "A lot of people, whether they are honest about it or not, want to use the current inflation episode as a morality play," said Skanda Amarnath, the executive director of Employ America.
What's implicit when people express outrage over high inflation, and claim that it was caused by high demand after people had stimulus checks and unemployment benefits to see them through, is that they would have preferred to offer less -- which would have brought about a slower, more painful recovery, "locking a lot of people out of work for a long time," Mr. Amarnath said. "It sounds ridiculous to say, 'We shouldn't get the jobs back quickly because of inflation."' But that's exactly what they mean.
Another economic nosedive will occur someday. Lawmakers will be faced with whether -- and how -- to act. They could heed the pandemic-era lesson that the government can and should act swiftly to prevent suffering and economic collapse. But if they focus instead on low inflation and decide that the better model was the anemic response to the Great Recession, we'll be in for a yearslong slog that saps the American people of income and the economy of its potential.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: G.O.P. leaders acceded to the demands of ultraconservatives to use the annual defense policy bill to lodge cultural grievances and protest continued U.S. support for Ukraine. Now its fate is in doubt.
A divided House voted on Thursday to restrict abortion access, bar transgender health services and limit diversity training for military personnel, potentially imperiling passage of the annual defense bill as Republicans, goaded by their right flank, loaded the measure with conservative policy dictates.
The House voted 221 to 213 to overturn a Pentagon policy guaranteeing abortion access to service members regardless of where they are stationed, with Republicans propelling it to passage over near-unanimous Democratic opposition.
By a vote of 222 to 211, the House also adopted a measure to bar the military's health plan from covering gender-transition surgeries -- which currently can be covered only with a waiver -- and gender-affirming hormone therapy. And the chamber voted 214 to 213 to eliminate the Pentagon's offices of diversity, equity and inclusion, along with all of their personnel.
Taken together, the series of changes -- which hard-right lawmakers had demanded be put on the floor as a condition for allowing the legislation to move forward -- threatened to sap critical Democratic support for the annual defense policy measure, an $ 886 billion bill that would grant a 5.2 percent pay raise to military personnel, counter aggressive moves by China and Russia, and establish a special inspector general to oversee U.S. aid to Ukraine.
"I don't think I've ever not voted for an N.D.A.A," said Representative Pete Aguilar, Democrat of California and the No. 3 Democrat, using the initials for the National Defense Authorization Act, one of the few pieces of legislation regarded as a must-pass item to come before Congress each year. "I'm a no."
The action came during an extraordinarily bitter debate in the House over the annual defense policy measure, normally a bipartisan affair that draws broad support, which this week has instead become a battlefield in a political culture war stoked by the G.O.P.
In heated exchanges on the floor, Republicans accused Democrats and the Biden administration of trying to turn the Pentagon into a hotbed of radical progressivism, while Democrats said Republicans were trying to use the Defense Department to achieve an extreme agenda of rolling back the rights of women, people of color and transgender individuals.
"It is this administration that has turned the Department of Defense into a social-engineering experiment wrapped in a uniform," Representative Chip Roy, Republican of Texas, said. "The American people I've talked to back home don't want a weak military; they don't want a woke military; they don't want rainbow propaganda on bases; they don't want to pay for troops' sex changes."
Democrats were particularly outraged at the inclusion of the abortion restriction, warning that they could not support the defense bill with such a measure included.
"The MAGA majority is using our defense bill to get one stop closer to the only thing they really care about: a nationwide abortion ban," Representative Katherine M. Clark of Massachusetts, the Democratic whip, said in a floor speech.
Without Democratic backing, Republicans would need near-unanimous support on their side to push the measure through the House, where they could afford to lose no more than four of their own members' votes.
It is unusual, though not unprecedented, for the House to pass a defense bill on a party-line vote. House Democrats did so in the summer of 2019 -- but with a much larger majority. And it was not clear whether Republicans would be able to muster that much support.
Even if Republicans can muscle the bill through the House, the measures they attached stand no chance of passing the Democratic-led Senate, which is expected to take up its version of the legislation next week. A protracted fight between the chambers could compromise the chances of ultimately reaching a compromise and enacting a bill, as Congress has done annually for more than six decades.
Democrats called the abortion measure unacceptable, particularly in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling last year overturning abortion rights, which set off a rush by some states to enact bans and curbs on the procedure.
Representative Mikie Sherrill, Democrat of New Jersey and a Navy veteran, said the Republican provision "puts servicewomen and military families' lives at risk by denying the basic right to travel for health care no longer available where they are stationed." Only one Democrat, Representative Henry Cuellar of Texas, voted in favor of overturning the Pentagon's abortion access policy.
Republicans defended the move as a matter of principle, arguing that the Pentagon policy it would overturn -- offering time off and travel reimbursement to troops traveling out of state to obtain an abortion -- violated a prohibition against taxpayer-funded abortions.
"This illegal Biden-endorsed policy has no place in our military," said Representative Ronny Jackson, Republican of Texas, the author of the proposal. "The taxpayer money is going directly to support abortions, and anyone in this chamber that says differently is blatantly lying to the American people."
The debate unfolded after Speaker Kevin McCarthy capitulated this week to a small group of ultraconservative Republicans who had threatened to block the defense legislation if their proposals, including pulling U.S. aid to Ukraine, did not receive consideration.
Instead the House moved forward on Thursday, slogging through dozens of proposed modifications. It overwhelmingly defeated two Republican efforts to cut U.S. military assistance for Ukraine. The vote was 341 to 89 to reject a measure from Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, to end a $ 300 million program to train and equip Ukrainian soldiers, which has been in place for almost a decade. And by a vote of 358 to 70, the House rejected a proposal from Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, to prohibit sending any more security assistance to Ukraine. In both cases, the supporters were all Republicans.
Those results were a victory for mainstream Republicans, who have defended U.S. military assistance to Ukraine as vital to countering Russia and are expected to support the Biden administration when it approaches Congress to approve additional money for Ukraine, likely this fall. But they reflected how anti-Ukraine sentiment is growing in the Republican ranks. In the spring, only 57 Republicans voted against a $ 40 billion package of military and humanitarian assistance for Ukraine.
Republican leaders had hoped to avoid those votes, which spotlighted their party's internal rifts over funding the war, as well as a bevy of social policy amendments that they worried could damage the G.O.P. brand. Instead, the debate at times devolved into an ugly exchange over matters of race, sex and gender.
At one point, Representative Eli Crane, an Arizona Republican who proposed barring diversity training from being a prerequisite for military jobs or promotions, appeared to refer to Black people as "colored people," in arguing in favor of his proposal.
"The military was never intended to be, you know, inclusive," Mr. Crane said, arguing that meeting standards should be the sole criterion. "My amendment has nothing to do with whether or not colored people or Black people or anybody can serve."
The remark drew instant condemnation on the House floor from Representative Joyce Beatty, an Ohio Democrat who is Black, who said it was offensive and demanded that it be stricken from the Congressional Record, which it was. In a statement provided later, Mr. Crane said he "misspoke" during the debate.
Hours earlier, Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, the senior Democrat on the Rules Committee, rebuked Republican leaders for their approach to the defense measure, saying they had "managed to mess up a bipartisan bill and put it on a path to becoming a hyperpartisan one by loading up with every divisive social issue under the sun," and accusing them of catering to "a dozen or so far-right MAGA wing nuts."
A Republican proposal to bar the Biden administration from sending cluster munitions to Ukraine also failed on Thursday night, splitting members of both parties in the process.
Republican leaders have been agitating for cluster munitions to be sent to Ukraine for months, while most Democrats were outraged last week when President Biden announced he intended to do so. They argued that the unwieldy warheads -- which scatter upon impact and routinely leave unexploded ordnance in the ground, endangering civilians for decades to come -- would cost the United States the moral high ground in the war.
This week, a number of conservative Republicans aligned themselves with the Democrats opposing the move. But on Thursday night, several Democrats were unhappy that the measure voted on was a proposal from Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, focused exclusively on denying the weapons for Ukraine, instead of a Democratic amendment that would have prohibited their export globally.

Oil Prices Creep Higher After Cuts Led by Saudis: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Prices have been creeping higher, despite uncertainty about the strength of the global economy.
The series of oil output cuts orchestrated by Saudi Arabia since last fall may finally be having an impact on prices. Markets had largely ignored those moves, focusing instead on the shaky global economy, but this week the price of Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose above $ 80 a barrel for the first time since late April.
In a report published on Thursday, the International Energy Agency, the Paris-based monitoring group, said output cuts could lead to substantial deficits in global oil supplies, beginning in July, potentially pushing up prices and squeezing consumers.
"After a period of relative calm, we do expect some renewed volatility and upward pressure on prices in the coming months," said Toril Bosoni, head of the oil market division at the International Energy Agency.
A sustained rise in prices would be a big win for the Saudi oil minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, who is chairman of the oil producers' group known as OPEC Plus. He has waged a campaign to convince traders that Saudi Arabia and other oil producers will make whatever output cuts are needed to keep markets in balance.
In early July, Saudi Arabia said it would extend a cut of one million barrels a day, which it first announced in June, for another month, through August. Notably, Russia also said it would take 500,000 barrels of oil a day off the market in August.
Analysts said Saudi Arabia wanted relatively high prices, in the $ 90-a-barrel range, to fund an ambitious development program led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the oil minister's half brother.
Until recently, markets shrugged off the Saudi moves. Traders worried about an economic downturn, especially in China, that could sap demand for oil, as well as tensions between Riyadh and Moscow that could lead to a battle for market share like the ones that slammed oil prices in 2014 and 2020.
"There is a great deal of negativity, a diverse type of negativity, that is taking everything as a hostage," Prince Abdulaziz said on July 5 at a conference that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries held at the opulent Hofburg Palace in Vienna.
Nevertheless, markets could be starting to turn in OPEC's favor.
"With Brent reaching $ 80 this week, I think people are going to reassess their skepticism about the Saudi strategy," said Helima Croft, head of global commodities at RBC, an investment bank.
Much depends on the economic outlook. If concerns about inflation and global growth ease, the price of oil may rise.
"I expect crude oil prices will rise sharply in the second half of this year due to solidly recovering demand in China, India, the U.S. and elsewhere, along with deep supply cuts by OPEC Plus producers, especially Saudi Arabia," said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, a research firm.
There are signs that Russia is cooperating with the Saudi-led cuts. The International Energy Agency said Russian oil exports in June fell about 8 percent from a month earlier. Moscow's revenues from these sales fell almost 50 percent from a year earlier, to $ 11.8 billion, the agency estimated.
Russian seaborne exports have dropped again in July to their lowest level this year, according to Viktor Katona, an analyst at Kpler, a firm that tracks these shipments.
Other factors may limit any significant rise in prices. For the first time this year, the International Energy Agency trimmed its forecast for growth in oil demand in 2023 by 220,000 barrels a day, to 2.2 million, largely because of slower-than-expected growth in China.
While global demand for oil is still expected to reach a record level of more than 102 million barrels a day in 2023, the agency forecasts that the pace of growth will halve in 2024, in part because electric vehicles help curb oil consumption.
At the same time, supplies are continuing to grow outside OPEC from countries including the United States, Brazil and Guyana, offsetting at least some of the impact of the group's cuts.
OPEC also remains a source of potential additional oil. The new cuts will take Saudi Arabia's production to just nine million barrels a day, the lowest in two years, the International Energy Agency estimates, trailing Russia as OPEC Plus's top producer. The Saudis want to bring back that production as soon as possible, analysts said.

Amazon Union Dissidents Challenge Its Leadership: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A split over the stewardship of the union's high-profile president, Christian Smalls, has led a rival faction to file a lawsuit seeking an election.
A dissident group within the Amazon Labor Union, the only certified union in the country representing Amazon employees, filed a complaint in federal court Monday seeking to force the union to hold a leadership election.
The union won an election at a Staten Island warehouse with more than 8,000 employees in April 2022, but Amazon has challenged the result and has yet to begin bargaining on a contract.
The rise of the dissident group, which calls itself the A.L.U. Democratic Reform Caucus and includes a co-founder and former treasurer of the union, reflects a growing split within the union that appears to have undermined its ability to pressure Amazon. The split has also threatened to sap the broader labor movement of the momentum generated by last year's high-profile victory.
In its complaint, the reform caucus argues that the union and its president, Christian Smalls, illegally "refuse to hold officer elections which should have been scheduled no later than March 2023."
The complaint asks a federal judge to schedule an election of the union's top officers for no later than Aug. 30 and to appoint a neutral monitor to oversee the election.
Mr. Smalls said in a text message Monday that the complaint was "a ridiculous claim with zero facts or merit," and a law firm representing the union said it would seek legal sanctions against the reform group's lawyer if the complaint was filed.
The complaint states that under an earlier version of the union's constitution, a leadership election was required within 60 days of the National Labor Relations Board's certification of its victory.
But in December, the month before the labor board certification, the union's leadership presented a new constitution to the membership that scheduled elections after the union ratifies a contract with Amazon -- an accomplishment that could take years, if it happens at all.
On Friday, the reform caucus sent the union's leadership a letter laying out its proposal to hold prompt elections, saying it would go to court Monday if the leadership didn't embrace the proposal.
The reform group is made of up more than 40 active organizers who are also plaintiffs in the legal complaint, including Connor Spence, a union co-founder and former treasurer; Brett Daniels, the union's former organizing director; and Brima Sylla, a prominent organizer at the Staten Island warehouse.
The group said in its letter that enacting the proposal could "mean the difference between an A.L.U. which is strong, effective, and a beacon of democracy in the labor movement" and "an A.L.U. which, in the end, became exactly what Amazon warned workers it would become: a business that takes away the workers' voices."
Mr. Smalls said in his text that the union leadership had worked closely with its law firm to ensure that its actions were legal, as well as with the U.S. Labor Department.
Jeanne Mirer, a lawyer for the union, wrote to a lawyer for the reform caucus that the lawsuit was frivolous and based on falsehoods. She said that Mr. Spence had "improperly and unilaterally" replaced the union's founding constitution with a revised version in June 2022, and that the revision, which called for elections after certification, had never been formally adopted by the union's board.
Retu Singla, another lawyer for the union, said in an interview that the constitution was never made final because there were disagreements about it within the union's leadership.
Mr. Spence said he and other members of the union's board had revised the constitution while consulting extensively with the union's lawyers. A second union official involved in the discussions corroborated his account.
The split within the union dates from last fall, when several longtime Amazon Labor Union organizers became frustrated with Mr. Smalls after a lopsided loss in a union election at an Amazon warehouse near Albany, N.Y.
In a meeting shortly after the election, organizers argued that control of the union rested in too few hands and that the leadership should be elected, giving rank-and-file workers more input.
The skeptics also complained that Mr. Smalls was committing the union to elections without a plan for how to win them, and that the union needed a better process for determining which organizing efforts to support. Many organizers worried that Mr. Smalls spent too much time traveling the country to make public appearances rather than focus on the contract fight on Staten Island.
Mr. Smalls later said in an interview that his travel was necessary to help raise money for the union and that the critics' preferred approach -- building up worker support for a potential strike that could bring Amazon to the bargaining table -- was counterproductive because it could alarm workers who feared losing their livelihoods.
He said a worker-led movement shouldn't turn its back on workers at other warehouses if they sought to unionize. A top union official hired by Mr. Smalls also argued that holding an election before the union had a more systematic way of reaching out to workers would be undemocratic because only the most committed activists would vote.
When Mr. Smalls unveiled the new union constitution in December, scheduling elections after a contract was ratified, many of the skeptics walked out. The two factions have operated independently this year, with both sides holding regular meetings with members.
In April, the reform caucus began circulating a petition among workers at the Staten Island warehouse calling on the leadership to amend the constitution and hold prompt elections. The petition has been signed by hundreds of workers at the facility.
The petition soon became a point of tension with Mr. Smalls. In an exchange with a member of the reform caucus on WhatsApp in early May, copies of which are included in Monday's legal complaint, Mr. Smalls said the union would "take legal action against you" if the caucus did not abandon the petition.
The tensions appeared to ease later that month after the union leadership under Mr. Smalls proposed that the two sides enter mediation. The reform caucus accepted the invitation and suspended the petition campaign.
But according to a memo that the mediator, Bill Fletcher Jr., sent both sides on June 29 and that was viewed by The New York Times, the union leadership backed out of the mediation process on June 18 without explanation.
"I am concerned that the apparent turmoil within the ALU E. Board means that little is being done to organize the workers and prepare for the battle with Amazon," Mr. Fletcher wrote in the memo, referring to the union's executive board. "This situation seriously weakens support among the workers."

The Billionaire Brawlers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Talks over a matchup between the two tech billionaires have progressed and the parameters of an event are taking shape.
The day after Elon Musk challenged Mark Zuckerberg on social media to "a cage match" last month, Dana White, president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, received a text.
It was from Mr. Zuckerberg, chief executive of Meta. He asked Mr. White, who heads the world's premier mixed martial arts competition, which is fought in cage-like rings, if Mr. Musk was serious about a fight.
Mr. White called Mr. Musk, who runs Tesla, Twitter and SpaceX, and confirmed that he was willing to throw down. Mr. White then relayed that to Mr. Zuckerberg. In response, Mr. Zuckerberg posted on Instagram: "Send Me Location," a reference to the catchphrase of Khabib Nurmagomedov, one of the U.F.C.'s most decorated athletes.
Since then, Mr. White said, he has talked to the tech billionaires separately every night to organize the showdown. On Tuesday, he said, he was "on the phone with those two until 12:45 in the morning." He added, "They both want to do it."
If you thought that a cage fight between two of the world's richest men was just a far-fetched social media stunt, think again.
Over the past 10 days, Mr. White said he, Mr. Musk and Mr. Zuckerberg -- aided by advisers -- have negotiated behind the scenes and are inching toward physical combat. While there are no guarantees a match will happen, the broad contours of an event are taking shape, said Mr. White and three people with knowledge of the discussions.
The fight would be an exhibition match, Mr. White said, and outside official U.F.C. jurisdiction and rights deals, though he would help produce the event. The tech leaders have agreed there should be a charity component, Mr. White and a person familiar with the talks said, with details still being worked out. The preferred location is Las Vegas, which requires approval from the Nevada Athletic Commission. On Thursday, Mr. Musk tweeted that the event could also happen in the Roman Colosseum.
Mr. Zuckerberg's friends and advisers have generally supported the match, two people close to him said, though others said a fight would be a distraction and not the best use of his time. One person close to Mr. Musk said that while he hated sports and didn't appear to have the discipline to train regularly, no one could rule anything out with him.
If the matchup between Mr. Musk, 52, and Mr. Zuckerberg, 39, goes ahead, it would be a rare spectacle, even in the braggadocio-filled universe of the tech industry. While Steve Jobs and Bill Gates used to snipe at each other, the closest the tech world had before this to real sporting feuds was among billionaire yachtsmen like Larry Ellison of Oracle and Hasso Plattner of SAP.
But two wildly wealthy tech titans grappling, punching and kicking in a Las Vegas or Roman arena? No one would have dreamed it.
Meta declined to comment. Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Musk have long teetered between being competitors, frenemies and outright enemies. The two have criticized each other over the years, including about Mr. Musk's SpaceX rockets, data privacy scandals at Meta and more. Most recently, Mr. Zuckerberg dispatched a team at Meta to build a competitor to Mr. Musk's Twitter, code-named Project 92.
If they take their rivalry beyond those jibes, the U.F.C.'s Mr. White said he had concerns about the physical gaps between the billionaires. Apart from their 13-year age difference, Mr. Musk is said to be at least 70 pounds heavier than Mr. Zuckerberg. In official mixed martial arts bouts, athletes are generally matched up by weight.
"We have two guys that have never professionally fought, and they're in two completely different weight classes," Mr. White said. Still, he said, "it will be the biggest fight in the history of combat sports."
Mr. Zuckerberg is especially familiar with the U.F.C. world. Over the past 18 months, he has embarked on a personal journey to bulk up and dove deep into Brazilian jujitsu, a grappling martial art in which competitors try to submit their opponent and which is used in U.F.C. fighting.
Mr. Zuckerberg started training on a lark mostly in his garage in 2021, where he built what he called a "mini academy" with a circle of friends who spar with him. He has said he appreciated that Brazilian jujitsu required "100 percent focus" and strategic thinking to defeat an opponent, rather than brute strength.
Mr. Zuckerberg has sought out martial arts experts, including Dave Camarillo, James Terry and Khai Wu. In May, he competed in his first public martial arts tournament in Redwood City, Calif., which he attended undercover -- up until the moment he took off his hat and sunglasses to fight. He won gold and silver medals in the challenge.
Last year, Meta also announced it had partnered with the U.F.C. to bring mixed martial arts fights to Horizon Worlds, its virtual reality app.
Mr. White said Mr. Zuckerberg was truly dedicated to the sport.
"I've been talking to Zuckerberg now for maybe close to two years now," he said. "And there's never like banter or we're joking and laughing." He said the Meta chief executive was "dead serious all the time."
Mr. Zuckerberg is likely in fighting shape. He has been on a strict workout regimen, going for runs and challenging friends and colleagues to beat his times, two people close to him said. Last month, he posted a personal record for completing the "Murph" challenge, which requires completing a series of pull-ups, push-ups, running multiple miles and doing hundreds of squats, all while wearing weighted, military-grade body armor.
"Doing sports that basically require your full attention, I think, is really important to my mental health and the way to stay focused on everything I'm doing," he said in a recent podcast episode.
Mr. Musk, on the other hand, has tweeted that he "almost never" works out and once suffered a back injury that required surgery after participating in an exhibition with a sumo wrestler. Last month, he said he had trained in "judo, Kyokushin (full contact)" -- two Japanese martial arts -- and "no rules streetfighting."
"He made that very clear: 'I'm not going to lose any weight,"' Mr. White said of Mr. Musk's approach to the potential matchup. "'Are we going to fight or are we not going to fight?"' Mr. White said Mr. Musk told him.
This week, Lex Fridman, a podcaster, posted photos of himself training judo with Mr. Musk. Mr. Fridman, who has also trained jujitsu with Mr. Zuckerberg, did not respond to a request for comment.
At least one person does not appear to be a fan of a fight: Maye Musk, Mr. Musk's mother.
"Don't encourage this match!" she recently tweeted, along with two frowning emojis.

The day after Elon Musk challenged Mark Zuckerberg on social media to “a cage match” in June, Dana White, president of the UFC, received a text.
It was from Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta. He asked White, who heads the world’s premier MMA competition, which is fought in cagelike rings, if Musk was serious about a fight.
White called Musk, who runs Tesla, Twitter and SpaceX, and confirmed that he was willing to throw down. White then relayed that to Zuckerberg. In response, Zuckerberg posted on Instagram, “Send Me Location,” a reference to the catchphrase of Khabib Nurmagomedov, one of the UFC’s most decorated athletes.
Since then, White said, he has talked to the tech billionaires separately every night to organize the showdown. On Tuesday, he said, he was “on the phone with those two until 12:45 in the morning.” He added, “They both want to do it.”
If you thought that a cage fight between two of the world’s richest men was just a far-fetched social media stunt, think again.
Over the past 10 days, White said he, Musk and Zuckerberg — aided by advisers — have negotiated behind the scenes and are inching toward physical combat. While there are no guarantees a match will happen, the broad contours of an event are taking shape, said White and three people with knowledge of the discussions.
The fight would be an exhibition match, White said, and outside official UFC jurisdiction and rights deals, though he would help produce the event. The tech leaders have agreed there should be a charity component, White and a person familiar with the talks said, with details still being worked out. The preferred location is Las Vegas, which requires approval from the Nevada Athletic Commission. On Thursday, Musk tweeted that the event could also happen in the Roman Colosseum.
Zuckerberg’s friends and advisers have generally supported the match, two people close to him said, though others said a fight would be a distraction and not the best use of his time. One person close to Musk said that while he hated sports and didn’t appear to have the discipline to train regularly, no one could rule anything out with him.
If the matchup between Musk, 52, and Zuckerberg, 39, goes ahead, it would be a rare spectacle, even in the braggadocio-filled universe of the tech industry. While Steve Jobs and Bill Gates used to snipe at each other, the closest the tech world had before this to real sporting feuds was among billionaire yachtsmen like Larry Ellison of Oracle and Hasso Plattner of SAP.
But two wildly wealthy tech titans grappling, punching and kicking in a Las Vegas or Roman arena? No one would have dreamed it.
Meta declined to comment. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.
Zuckerberg and Musk have long teetered between being competitors, frenemies and outright enemies. The two have criticized each other over the years, including about Musk’s SpaceX rockets, data privacy scandals at Meta and more. Most recently, Zuckerberg dispatched a team at Meta to build a competitor to Musk’s Twitter, code-named Project 92.
If they take their rivalry beyond those jibes, White said he had concerns about the physical gaps between the billionaires. Apart from their 13-year age difference, Musk is said to be at least 70 pounds heavier than Zuckerberg. In official MMA bouts, athletes are generally matched up by weight.
“We have two guys that have never professionally fought, and they’re in two completely different weight classes,” White said. Still, he said, “it will be the biggest fight in the history of combat sports.”
Zuckerberg is especially familiar with the UFC world. Over the past 18 months, he has embarked on a personal journey to bulk up and dove deep into Brazilian jujitsu, a grappling martial art in which competitors try to submit their opponent and which is used in UFC fighting.
Zuckerberg started training on a lark mostly in his garage in 2021, where he built what he called a “mini academy” with a circle of friends who spar with him. He has said he appreciated that Brazilian jujitsu required “100% focus” and strategic thinking to defeat an opponent, rather than brute strength.
Zuckerberg has sought out martial arts experts, including Dave Camarillo, James Terry and Khai Wu. In May, he competed in his first public martial arts tournament in Redwood City, California, which he attended undercover — up until the moment he took off his hat and sunglasses to fight. He won gold and silver medals in the challenge.
Last year, Meta also announced it had partnered with the UFC to bring MMA fights to Horizon Worlds, its virtual reality app.
White said Zuckerberg was truly dedicated to the sport.
“I’ve been talking to Zuckerberg now for maybe close to two years now,” he said. “And there’s never, like, banter or we’re joking and laughing.” He said Zuckerberg was “dead serious all the time.”

“He made that very clear: ‘I’m not going to lose any weight,’” White said of Musk’s approach to the potential matchup. “‘Are we going to fight, or are we not going to fight?’” White said Musk told him.
Last week, Lex Fridman, a podcaster, posted photos of himself training judo with Musk. Fridman, who has also trained jujitsu with Zuckerberg, did not respond to a request for comment.

Key Measure Of Inflation Falls, Giving Slack to Fed: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Federal Reserve is watching to see how much the economy is slowing as it tries to wrangle inflation. Fresh data offered hopeful hints.
Consumer spending slowed and the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge continued to moderate in May, the latest signs that the cool-down that policymakers have been aiming for is materializing -- albeit more haltingly than they might prefer.
U.S. consumers spent just 0.1 percent more in May than the month before, the Commerce Department said on Friday. That was down from 0.6 percent growth in April, which was itself weaker than previously reported. Adjusted for inflation, spending in May was flat.
Slower spending may sound like bad news: Consumption is, after all, the engine of economic growth in America. But Fed officials have been raising interest rates to try to restrain consumer and business demand, hoping that such a weakening will force companies to stop raising prices so quickly. That could allow inflation, which has been rapid for more than two years, to return to a normal pace.
For now, price increases are moderating but remain more stubborn than Fed officials might prefer. Overall inflation cooled to 3.8 percent in the year through May, Friday's report showed, the first time it has slipped below 4 percent since early 2021. But a "core" inflation measure that stripped out food and fuel costs -- which move around a lot -- remained stubbornly high. Officials closely watch that measure for a sense of how quickly prices will increase in the months and years ahead.
While core inflation moderated to 4.6 percent in May, a softer reading than the 4.7 percent economists had forecast, it has hovered right around that pace since December.
"It's progress," Omair Sharif, the founder of Inflation Insights, said of the report as a whole. "But things are still just way too high."
More modest overall inflation is taking some pressure off consumers: Cheaper tanks of gas and less rapid price increases in the grocery aisle are helping paychecks go further. But for officials at the Fed, signs that inflation remains stubborn under the surface have been a reason to worry. Officials believe that they need to wrestle core price increases lower to make sure that the economy's future is one of modest and steady price increases.
Fed policymakers have been raising interest rates since March 2022 in a bid to cool the economy and bring inflation back under control, and they have projected that they will raise them slightly more in 2023. Making it more expensive to get a home loan or expand a business can drag on economic momentum.
But a range of recent data points have suggested that the Fed's moves are so far failing to fully sap the economy of its steam. The housing market weakened sharply last year, but it has shown signs it is beginning to recover. Growth was faster than previously believed early this year, data this week showed. People are still buying cars, taking vacations and eating out, based on a range of real-time data trackers.
In fact, Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, cautioned against reading too much into the slowdown in consumer spending in the fresh May data. She thought that some of the pullback was probably owed to a limited supply of cars, which prevented more auto sales.
Still, she said the report was marginally good news for policymakers. The fact that April spending was weaker than the strong uptick previously reported was probably a welcome development.
"It is better than the alternative," Ms. Bostjancic said.
And the report contained subtle but important hints that consumers are becoming more cautious. After months of drawing down savings amid rising prices, Americans have begun saving more, which historically has been a sign of worries about the economy.
"Consumers are saving more and spending less, perhaps out of caution as most believe a recession is either here or imminent," Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union, wrote in a note to clients.
That could help make the Fed more comfortable that rates are high enough -- or nearly high enough -- to restrain the economy and bring inflation back to target over time.
Policymakers have raised interest rates to 5 percent, but they skipped a rate increase at their June meeting, after 10 straight moves, to give themselves time to assess how much more would be needed. Officials forecast that they could lift rates to 5.5 percent by the end of the year.
Investors had been betting on only one more quarter-point move this year, but they have in recent days nudged up the chances of two moves before the end of 2023. Those odds fell slightly after Friday's report. Markets broadly welcomed the fresh data, helping to push the S&P 500 stock index more than 1 percent higher on Friday.
Ms. Bostjancic said she believed that the Fed would most likely raise interest rates in July still but that Friday's consumer spending data could -- at least at the margin -- "ease the pressure" for further changes beyond that.
Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, emphasized this week at an event in Madrid that the outlook for how much more rates might move this year was uncertain.
Inflation has consistently been "more persistent and stronger than expected," Mr. Powell said. "At some point, that may change. And I think we have to be ready to follow the data and be a little patient as we let this unfold."

The West's Kingdom of Stone Is Losing Its River: [Climate]

Full text: Down beneath the tourist lodges and shops selling keychains and incense, past windswept arroyos and brown valleys speckled with agave, juniper and sagebrush, the rocks of the Grand Canyon seem untethered from time. The oldest ones date back 1.8 billion years, not just eons before humans laid eyes on them, but eons before evolution endowed any organism on this planet with eyes.
Spend long enough in the canyon, and you might start feeling a little unmoored from time yourself. The immense walls form a kind of cocoon, sealing you off from the modern world, with its cell signal and light pollution and disappointments. They draw your eyes relentlessly upward, as in a cathedral.
You might think you are seeing all the way to the top. But up and above are more walls, and above them even more, out of sight except for the occasional glimpse. For the canyon is not just deep. It is broad, too -- 18 miles, rim to rim, at its widest. This is no mere cathedral of stone. It is a kingdom: sprawling, self-contained, an alternate reality existing magnificently outside of our own.
And yet, the Grand Canyon remains yoked to the present in one key respect. The Colorado River, whose wild energy incised the canyon over millions of years, is in crisis.
As the planet warms, low snow is starving the river at its headwaters in the Rockies, and higher temperatures are pilfering more of it through evaporation. The seven states that draw on the river are using just about every drop it can provide, and while a wet winter and a recent deal between states have staved off its collapse for now, its long-term health remains in deep doubt.
Our species' mass migration to the West was premised on the belief that money, engineering and frontier pluck could sustain civilization in a pitilessly dry place. More and more, that belief looks as wispy as a dream.
The Colorado flows so far beneath the Grand Canyon's rim that many of the four million people who visit the national park each year see it only as a faint thread, glinting in the distance. But the river's fate matters profoundly for the 280-mile-long canyon and the way future generations will experience it. Our subjugation of the Colorado has already set in motion sweeping shifts to the canyon's ecosystems and landscapes -- shifts that a group of scientists and graduate students from the University of California, Davis, recently set out to see by raft: a slow trip through deep time, at a moment when Earth's clock seems to be speeding up.
John Weisheit, who helps lead the conservation group Living Rivers, has been rafting on the Colorado for over four decades. Seeing how much the canyon has changed, just in his lifetime, makes him "hugely depressed," he said. "You know how you feel like when you go to the cemetery? That's how I feel."
Still, every year or so, he comes. "Because you need to see an old friend."
The lands of western North America know well of nature's cycles of birth and growth and destruction. Eras and epochs ago, this place was a tropical sea, with tentacled, snaillike creatures stalking prey beneath its waves. Then it was a vast sandy desert. Then a sea once again.
At some point, energy from deep inside the Earth started thrusting a huge section of crust skyward and into the path of ancient rivers that crisscrossed the terrain. For tens of millions of years, the crust pushed up and the rivers rolled down, grinding away at the landscape, up, down, up, down. A chasm was cleaved open, which the meandering water joined over time with other canyons, making one. Weather, gravity and plate tectonics warped and sculpted the exposed layers of surrounding stone into fluid, fantastical forms.
The Grand Canyon is a planetary spectacle like none other -- one that also happens to host a river that 40 million people rely on for water and power. And the event that crystallized this odd, uneasy duality -- that changed nearly everything for the canyon -- feels almost small compared with all the geologic upheavals that took place before it: the pouring, 15 miles upstream, of a wall of concrete.
Since 1963, the Glen Canyon Dam has been backing up the Colorado for nearly 200 miles, in the form of America's second-largest reservoir, Lake Powell. Engineers constantly evaluate water and electricity needs to decide how much of the river to let through the dam's works and out the other end, first into the Grand Canyon, then into Lake Mead and, eventually, into fields and homes in Arizona, California, Nevada and Mexico.
The dam processes the Colorado's mercurial flows -- a trickle one year and a roaring, spiteful surge the next -- into something less extreme on both ends. But for the canyon, regulating the river has come with big environmental costs. And, as the water keeps dwindling, plundered by drought and overuse, these costs could rise.
As recently as a few months ago, the water in Lake Powell was so low that there almost wasn't enough to turn the dam's turbines. If it fell past that level in the coming years -- and there is every indication that it could -- power generation would cease, and the only way water would be released from the dam is through four pipes that sit closer to the bottom of the lake. As the reservoir declined further, the amount of pressure pushing water through these pipes would diminish, meaning smaller and smaller amounts could be discharged out the other end.
If the water dropped much more beyond that, the pipes would begin sucking air, and in time Powell would be at "dead pool": Not a drop would pass through the dam until and unless the water reached the pipes again.
With these doubts about the Colorado's future in mind, the U.C. Davis scientists rigged up electric-blue inflatable rafts on a cool spring morning. Slate-gray sky, low clouds. Cowboy coffee on a propane burner. At Mile 0 of the Grand Canyon, the river is running at around 7,000 cubic feet per second, rising toward 9,000 -- not the lowest flows on record, but far from the highest.
Cubic feet per second can be a little abstract. As the group paddles toward the canyon's first rapids, Daniel Ostrowski, a master's student in agronomy at Davis, says it helps to think of basketballs. Lots of them. A regulation basketball fits loosely inside a foot-wide cube. Draw a line across the canyon, and imagine 9,000 basketballs tumbling past it every second.
At Mile 10, the scientists float by a more tangible visual aid. Ages ago, a giant slab of sandstone plunged into the riverbed from the cliffs above, and now it looms over the water like a hulking Cubist elephant. Or at 9,000 basketballs per second it looms. At higher flows -- 12,600 basketballs, say -- it's submerged to its knees. At three times that, the water comes up to its head. And at 84,000, which is how much ran through in July 1983, the elephant is all but invisible, a ripple at the river's surface.
The big problem with low water in the canyon, the one that compounds all others, is that things stop moving. The Colorado is a sort of circulatory system. Its flows carved the canyon but also sustain it, making it amenable to plants, wildlife and boaters. To understand what's happened since the dam started regulating the river, first consider the smallest things that its water moves, or fails to move.
The Colorado picks up immense amounts of sand and silt charging down the Rockies, but the dam stops basically all of it from continuing into the Grand Canyon. Downstream tributaries, including the Paria and Little Colorado, add some sediment to the river, but not nearly as much as gets trapped in Lake Powell. Plus, when river flows are weak, more sediment settles on the riverbed.
The result is that the canyon's sandy beaches, where animals live and boaters camp at night, are shrinking. Beaches that were once as wide as freeways are today more like two-lane roads. Others are even scrawnier. The sandy space that remains is also becoming overgrown with vegetation: cattail and brittlebush, arrowweed and seepwillow, bushy tamarisk and spiny camelthorn. Before the dam came in, the river's springtime floods regularly washed this greenery away.
A lusher, less-barren canyon might not sound like a bad thing. But grasses and shrubs block the wind from blowing sand onto the slopes and terraces, where hundreds of cultural sites preserve the history of the peoples who lived in and around the canyon. Sand shields these sites, which include stone structures, slab-lined granaries and craterlike roasting pits, from weather and the elements. With less sand drifting up from the riverside, the sites are more exposed to erosion and trampling by visitors.
Also, not every place in the canyon is becoming greener. Drought can sap the water that courses within the porous stone walls, water that, where it spurts out, sometimes feeds eye-popping bursts of plant life. Lately, some of these springs, like Vasey's Paradise at Mile 32, have dried to a dribble for long stretches. But a few bends downriver, the U.C. Davis scientists spot several hanging gardens that, for now, are still thriving.
Besides sand, the Colorado is failing to move larger objects in the canyon. Cobbles and boulders periodically tumble in from hundreds of tributaries and side canyons, often during flash floods, creating bends and rapids in the river. With fewer strong flows to whisk this debris away, more of it is piling up at those bends and rapids. This has made many rapids steeper and narrowed boaters' paths for navigating them.
Today, when the water is low, more boulders in the river are exposed at certain rapids, making them trickier to negotiate for the 30-to-40-foot-long motor rigs that are popular for canyon tours. In a future of prolonged low flows, tour companies might find it harder to run such large boats safely, cutting off one main way to experience the canyon intimately.
Drought and low water aside, there's another aspect of the canyon's future that worries Victor R. Baker, a geologist at the University of Arizona. Dr. Baker has spent four decades exploring alcoves, high ledges and tributary mouths in the Colorado Basin. He scours them for the very particular patterns of sand and silt left by giant floods. The stories they tell are startling.
Mad cascades of water, ones at least as large as any the Grand Canyon experienced in the 20th century, swept through it at least 15 times in the past four and a half millenniums, Dr. Baker and his colleagues have found. Geological evidence upriver from the dam points to 44 large floods of varying sizes there, most of them in the last 500 years.
As the atmosphere warms, allowing it to hold more moisture, the risk of another such deluge could be rising. If one struck when Lake Powell were already flush with melted snow, it could take out the dam, not to mention do considerable work on the canyon.
"I would think the future is going to be one moving toward, as they said in war, long periods of boredom interrupted by short episodes of total, absolute terror," Dr. Baker said.
None of the government agencies with a hand in managing the canyon can do much about that, not on their own. But they are trying to beat back some of the other forces remaking the canyon from within.
Since 1996, the Bureau of Reclamation, which owns Glen Canyon Dam, has occasionally released blasts of reservoir water to kick up sand from the riverbed and rebuild the canyon's beaches. The effects are noticeable. But the bureau conducts these "high-flow experiments" only when there's enough water in Powell to spare. In April, it held its first one in five years.
The National Park Service works to preserve the Grand Canyon's archaeological sites against erosion, even if that means leaving them swaddled in sand, where nobody sees them. "Those cultural resources that are covered by the sand are well suited by being covered by the sand," said Ed Keable, the park's superintendent.
Other issues, though, are so entrenched that addressing them just creates other problems. Take the spread of tamarisk, an invasive treelike shrub that has displaced native vegetation in the canyon and around other Western rivers. About two decades ago, officials decided to fight back by releasing beetles that loved eating tamarisk leaves. But the beetles loved those leaves so much, and their numbers grew so quickly, that they began threatening the Southwestern willow flycatcher, an endangered bird that nests in tamarisk.
There is a similar no-win feeling to the bigger question of how to keep the Colorado useful to everyone as it shrivels. The dam is the root cause of the canyon's environmental shifts, which also include big changes to fish populations. But simply allowing the river to flow more naturally through the existing dam, so water is stored primarily in Lake Mead instead of in both Mead and Powell, wouldn't reverse the shifts entirely.
Jack Schmidt, the director of the Center for Colorado River Studies at Utah State University, has concluded that the only way to allow sufficiently large amounts of sediment-rich water back into the canyon, short of dynamiting the dam, would be to drill new diversion tunnels into the sandstone around it. That would be costly, and require careful planning to dampen the immediate ecological effects.
"Like everything else in that damn river system," Dr. Schmidt said, "there's a consequence to everything."
It's the U.C. Davis scientists' sixth night on the Colorado, and it comes after several numbing hours of paddling against the wind. As the sun touches the canyon walls with the day's last glimmers of orange and gold, the graduate students sit in camp chairs chewing over what they've seen.
They are preparing for careers as academics and experts and policymakers, people who will shape how we live with the environmental fallout of past choices. Choices like damming rivers. Like building cities in floodplains. Like running economies on fossil fuels. Once, those were first-rate answers to society's needs. Now they require answers of their own -- a whole wearying cascade of problems prompting solutions that create more problems.
"It becomes overwhelming," says Alma Wilcox, a master's student in environmental policy, sitting by a scraggly, haunted-looking grove of tamarisk. It helps, she says, to focus: "Having control over a really small aspect of it is empowering."
Yara Pasner, a doctoral student in hydrology, says she feels a duty to make sure the load on future generations is lessened, even if, or perhaps because, our forebears didn't do us that courtesy. "There's been a mentality that we will mess this up and the future generation will have more tools to fix this." Instead, she says, we've found that the consequences of many past decisions are harder to cope with than expected.
The next morning, the group floats into the realm of the canyon's oldest rocks. Almost two billion years ago, islands in the primordial sea crashed into the landmass that would become North America. The unimaginable heat and pressure from the collision cooked the rocks and sediment on the seafloor into layers of inky, shiny rock. This rock then lay buried beneath mountains that were formed in the collision, becoming squished and folded to create the otherworldly masses flanking the river today, which resemble nothing so much as freshly churned ice cream: dark gray schist swirled with salmon-pink granite.
But the mountains that sat above them? Those are all but gone, ground down over eons, their remnants long since scattered and recombined into new mountains, new formations.
"There were the Himalayas on top of this," says Nicholas Pinter, the Davis geologist who has helped lead this expedition, gesturing from the end of a raft at Mile 78. "And it's eroded," he says. "Worn to an almost infinitesimally flat plane, before it all begins again."
Somewhere in among those grand happenings -- within the tiniest, most insignificant-seeming snatches of geologic time -- is the world we live in, the one we have.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Down beneath the tourist lodges and shops selling keychains and incense, past windswept arroyos and brown valleys speckled with agave, juniper and sagebrush, the rocks of the Grand Canyon seem untethered from time. The oldest ones date back 1.8 billion years, not just eons before humans laid eyes on them, but eons before evolution endowed any organism on this planet with eyes.
Spend long enough in the canyon, and you might start feeling a little unmoored from time yourself. The immense walls form a kind of cocoon, sealing you off from the modern world, with its cell signal and light pollution and disappointments. They draw your eyes relentlessly upward, as in a cathedral.
You might think you are seeing all the way to the top. But up and above are more walls, and above them even more, out of sight except for the occasional glimpse. For the canyon is not just deep. It is broad, too -- 18 miles, rim to rim, at its widest. This is no mere cathedral of stone. It is a kingdom: sprawling, self-contained, an alternate reality existing magnificently outside of our own.
And yet, the Grand Canyon remains yoked to the present in one key respect. The Colorado River, whose wild energy incised the canyon over millions of years, is in crisis.
As the planet warms, low snow is starving the river at its headwaters in the Rockies, and higher temperatures are pilfering more of it through evaporation. The seven states that draw on the river are using just about every drop it can provide, and while a wet winter and a recent deal between states have staved off its collapse for now, its long-term health remains in deep doubt.
Our species' mass migration to the West was premised on the belief that money, engineering and frontier pluck could sustain civilization in a pitilessly dry place. More and more, that belief looks as wispy as a dream.
The Colorado flows so far beneath the Grand Canyon's rim that many of the four million people who visit the national park each year see it only as a faint thread, glinting in the distance. But the river's fate matters profoundly for the 280-mile-long canyon and the way future generations will experience it. Our subjugation of the Colorado has already set in motion sweeping shifts to the canyon's ecosystems and landscapes -- shifts that a group of scientists and graduate students from the University of California, Davis, recently set out to see by raft: a slow trip through deep time, at a moment when Earth's clock seems to be speeding up.
John Weisheit, who helps lead the conservation group Living Rivers, has been rafting on the Colorado for over four decades. Seeing how much the canyon has changed, just in his lifetime, makes him "hugely depressed," he said. "You know how you feel like when you go to the cemetery? That's how I feel."
Still, every year or so, he comes. "Because you need to see an old friend."
The lands of western North America know well of nature's cycles of birth and growth and destruction. Eras and epochs ago, this place was a tropical sea, with tentacled, snaillike creatures stalking prey beneath its waves. Then it was a vast sandy desert. Then a sea once again.
At some point, energy from deep inside the Earth started thrusting a huge section of crust skyward and into the path of ancient rivers that crisscrossed the terrain. For tens of millions of years, the crust pushed up and the rivers rolled down, grinding away at the landscape, up, down, up, down. A chasm was cleaved open, which the meandering water joined over time with other canyons, making one. Weather, gravity and plate tectonics warped and sculpted the exposed layers of surrounding stone into fluid, fantastical forms.
The Grand Canyon is a planetary spectacle like none other -- one that also happens to host a river that 40 million people rely on for water and power. And the event that crystallized this odd, uneasy duality -- that changed nearly everything for the canyon -- feels almost small compared with all the geologic upheavals that took place before it: the pouring, 15 miles upstream, of a wall of concrete.
Since 1963, the Glen Canyon Dam has been backing up the Colorado for nearly 200 miles, in the form of America's second-largest reservoir, Lake Powell. Engineers constantly evaluate water and electricity needs to decide how much of the river to let through the dam's works and out the other end, first into the Grand Canyon, then into Lake Mead and, eventually, into fields and homes in Arizona, California, Nevada and Mexico.
The dam processes the Colorado's mercurial flows -- a trickle one year and a roaring, spiteful surge the next -- into something less extreme on both ends. But for the canyon, regulating the river has come with big environmental costs. And, as the water keeps dwindling, plundered by drought and overuse, these costs could rise.
As recently as a few months ago, the water in Lake Powell was so low that there almost wasn't enough to turn the dam's turbines. If it fell past that level in the coming years -- and there is every indication that it could -- power generation would cease, and the only way water would be released from the dam is through four pipes that sit closer to the bottom of the lake. As the reservoir declined further, the amount of pressure pushing water through these pipes would diminish, meaning smaller and smaller amounts could be discharged out the other end.
If the water dropped much more beyond that, the pipes would begin sucking air, and in time Powell would be at "dead pool": Not a drop would pass through the dam until and unless the water reached the pipes again.
With these doubts about the Colorado's future in mind, the U.C. Davis scientists rigged up electric-blue inflatable rafts on a cool spring morning. Slate-gray sky, low clouds. Cowboy coffee on a propane burner. At Mile 0 of the Grand Canyon, the river is running at around 7,000 cubic feet per second, rising toward 9,000 -- not the lowest flows on record, but far from the highest.
Cubic feet per second can be a little abstract. As the group paddles toward the canyon's first rapids, Daniel Ostrowski, a master's student in agronomy at Davis, says it helps to think of basketballs. Lots of them. A regulation basketball fits loosely inside a foot-wide cube. Draw a line across the canyon, and imagine 9,000 basketballs tumbling past it every second.
At Mile 10, the scientists float by a more tangible visual aid. Ages ago, a giant slab of sandstone plunged into the riverbed from the cliffs above, and now it looms over the water like a hulking Cubist elephant. Or at 9,000 basketballs per second it looms. At higher flows -- 12,600 basketballs, say -- it's submerged to its knees. At three times that, the water comes up to its head. And at 84,000, which is how much ran through in July 1983, the elephant is all but invisible, a ripple at the river's surface.
The big problem with low water in the canyon, the one that compounds all others, is that things stop moving. The Colorado is a sort of circulatory system. Its flows carved the canyon but also sustain it, making it amenable to plants, wildlife and boaters. To understand what's happened since the dam started regulating the river, first consider the smallest things that its water moves, or fails to move.
The Colorado picks up immense amounts of sand and silt charging down the Rockies, but the dam stops basically all of it from continuing into the Grand Canyon. Downstream tributaries, including the Paria and Little Colorado, add some sediment to the river, but not nearly as much as gets trapped in Lake Powell. Plus, when river flows are weak, more sediment settles on the riverbed.
The result is that the canyon's sandy beaches, where animals live and boaters camp at night, are shrinking. Beaches that were once as wide as freeways are today more like two-lane roads. Others are even scrawnier. The sandy space that remains is also becoming overgrown with vegetation: cattail and brittlebush, arrowweed and seepwillow, bushy tamarisk and spiny camelthorn. Before the dam came in, the river's springtime floods regularly washed this greenery away.
A lusher, less-barren canyon might not sound like a bad thing. But grasses and shrubs block the wind from blowing sand onto the slopes and terraces, where hundreds of cultural sites preserve the history of the peoples who lived in and around the canyon. Sand shields these sites, which include stone structures, slab-lined granaries and craterlike roasting pits, from weather and the elements. With less sand drifting up from the riverside, the sites are more exposed to erosion and trampling by visitors.
Also, not every place in the canyon is becoming greener. Drought can sap the water that courses within the porous stone walls, water that, where it spurts out, sometimes feeds eye-popping bursts of plant life. Lately, some of these springs, like Vasey's Paradise at Mile 32, have dried to a dribble for long stretches. But a few bends downriver, the U.C. Davis scientists spot several hanging gardens that, for now, are still thriving.
Besides sand, the Colorado is failing to move larger objects in the canyon. Cobbles and boulders periodically tumble in from hundreds of tributaries and side canyons, often during flash floods, creating bends and rapids in the river. With fewer strong flows to whisk this debris away, more of it is piling up at those bends and rapids. This has made many rapids steeper and narrowed boaters' paths for navigating them.
Today, when the water is low, more boulders in the river are exposed at certain rapids, making them trickier to negotiate for the 30-to-40-foot-long motor rigs that are popular for canyon tours. In a future of prolonged low flows, tour companies might find it harder to run such large boats safely, cutting off one main way to experience the canyon intimately.
Drought and low water aside, there's another aspect of the canyon's future that worries Victor R. Baker, a geologist at the University of Arizona. Dr. Baker has spent four decades exploring alcoves, high ledges and tributary mouths in the Colorado Basin. He scours them for the very particular patterns of sand and silt left by giant floods. The stories they tell are startling.
Mad cascades of water, ones at least as large as any the Grand Canyon experienced in the 20th century, swept through it at least 15 times in the past four and a half millenniums, Dr. Baker and his colleagues have found. Geological evidence upriver from the dam points to 44 large floods of varying sizes there, most of them in the last 500 years.
As the atmosphere warms, allowing it to hold more moisture, the risk of another such deluge could be rising. If one struck when Lake Powell were already flush with melted snow, it could take out the dam, not to mention do considerable work on the canyon.
"I would think the future is going to be one moving toward, as they said in war, long periods of boredom interrupted by short episodes of total, absolute terror," Dr. Baker said.
None of the government agencies with a hand in managing the canyon can do much about that, not on their own. But they are trying to beat back some of the other forces remaking the canyon from within.
Since 1996, the Bureau of Reclamation, which owns Glen Canyon Dam, has occasionally released blasts of reservoir water to kick up sand from the riverbed and rebuild the canyon's beaches. The effects are noticeable. But the bureau conducts these "high-flow experiments" only when there's enough water in Powell to spare. In April, it held its first one in five years.
The National Park Service works to preserve the Grand Canyon's archaeological sites against erosion, even if that means leaving them swaddled in sand, where nobody sees them. "Those cultural resources that are covered by the sand are well suited by being covered by the sand," said Ed Keable, the park's superintendent.
Other issues, though, are so entrenched that addressing them just creates other problems. Take the spread of tamarisk, an invasive treelike shrub that has displaced native vegetation in the canyon and around other Western rivers. About two decades ago, officials decided to fight back by releasing beetles that loved eating tamarisk leaves. But the beetles loved those leaves so much, and their numbers grew so quickly, that they began threatening the Southwestern willow flycatcher, an endangered bird that nests in tamarisk.
There is a similar no-win feeling to the bigger question of how to keep the Colorado useful to everyone as it shrivels. The dam is the root cause of the canyon's environmental shifts, which also include big changes to fish populations. But simply allowing the river to flow more naturally through the existing dam, so water is stored primarily in Lake Mead instead of in both Mead and Powell, wouldn't reverse the shifts entirely.
Jack Schmidt, the director of the Center for Colorado River Studies at Utah State University, has concluded that the only way to allow sufficiently large amounts of sediment-rich water back into the canyon, short of dynamiting the dam, would be to drill new diversion tunnels into the sandstone around it. That would be costly, and require careful planning to dampen the immediate ecological effects.
"Like everything else in that damn river system," Dr. Schmidt said, "there's a consequence to everything."
It's the U.C. Davis scientists' sixth night on the Colorado, and it comes after several numbing hours of paddling against the wind. As the sun touches the canyon walls with the day's last glimmers of orange and gold, the graduate students sit in camp chairs chewing over what they've seen.

Arizona's Boom Towns Ponder Growth Amid a Water Shortage: [National Desk]

Full text: The state announced new limits to construction because of water shortages, changing the course of development.
As the mayor of an old farming town bursting with new homes, factories and warehouses, Eric Orsborn spends his days thinking about water. The lifeblood for this growth is billions of gallons of water pumped from the ground, and his city, Buckeye, Ariz., is thirsty for more as builders push deeper into the desert fringes of Phoenix.
But last week, Arizona announced it would limit some future home construction in Buckeye and other places because of a shortfall in groundwater. The worried calls started pouring in to Mr. Orsborn.
"I have neighbors who come up to me and say, 'What are you doing? Are we running out of water?"' Mr. Orsborn said. "It put our community on edge, thinking, 'What is going on here and do I need to move?"'
No, he tells them. Breathe.
The upheaval was caused by a new state study that found groundwater supplies in the Phoenix area were about 4 percent short of what is needed for planned growth over the next 100 years. That may feel like a far-off horizon, but it is enough of a change to force the state to rethink its future in the near and long terms.
Now, there areurgent questions about how Arizona should be using its increasingly precious water -- for water-guzzling alfalfa and lettuce farms or thirsty new computer chip and battery factories and coffee-creamer manufacturing? For new sprawl or more development inside cities? Could the Phoenix suburbs keep up their frenzied pace of growth? Should they?
"No, we're not out of business," said Grady Gammage, a former president of the Central Arizona Project, an aqueduct system that carries Colorado River water to Phoenix and Tucson. "This may slow growth somewhat. I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing."
Arizona has some of the strictest groundwater laws in the country in more regulated areas like Phoenix. For decades, the state has required new developments to show they have a 100-year supply of water before they can sell lots or break ground.
The projected shortfall means that developers in Phoenix's fast-growing outskirts can no longer get state approval to build new subdivisions that rely on groundwater wells, meaning they have to get water from somewhere else.
But there are limited sources of new water at a moment when cities and developers across Arizona and other fast-growing Western states are competing for every spare drop. Experts said that could drive up housing costs that have already increased by 51 percent over the past four years, according to Zillow, and sap Arizona's appeal as an affordable destination for businesses and new residents.
"It'll change the way development looks," Mr. Gammage said. "Higher density, less turf, fewer swimming pools."
Ever since news of the groundwater shortage sent shock waves across the Phoenix area, mayors, developers and business groups have been trying to reassure jittery investors, homeowners and potential new businesses that Arizona still has water, even as the threats of climate change and the shriveling Colorado River begin to reorder its future.
Gov. Katie Hobbs, who has made Arizona's water supply a focus of her first months in office, said the groundwater decision would not derail any projects that have already been approved and would have little effect on development in most big cities around the Phoenix area. Even on the edge of the suburbs, the state said there was also a supply of 80,000 lots with permission to build that can keep moving forward.
But to some residents around Buckeye, regularly ranked as one of the 10 fastest-growing cities in the country, it felt like an overdrawn account finally coming due -- the start of a thirstier new era where the rapidly expanding Phoenix area cannot keep growing by spilling endlessly into the Sonoran desert.
"I worry all the time," said Trudy Hann, 71, who moved to Buckeye in 1980, when the population was just 3,400. Today, it has more than 110,000 residents, and city officials say they envision 1.5 million people living there -- enough to rival the current size of Phoenix.
On Saturday afternoon, Ms. Hann and her family huddled under an umbrella in a subdivision of Spanish-tiled homes bordering an unbroken expanse of desert, watching her grandson play flag football on a grassy field fed by treated wastewater.
Inocente Cayetano moved from Goodyear, Ariz., to Buckeye, just 15 miles west, shortly before the pandemic because it was cheap, without a concern about water. He said a starter home cost $ 100,000 less in Buckeye than it did just one town closer to Phoenix, allowing him to invest his savings in a mobile coffee trailer. The business took off, and he just broke ground on building a storefront location in one of Buckeye's fancier master-planned communities.
"It's a little gold mine," he said.
He trusts the city will have enough water to brew his coffee and fill his faucets.
Buckeye's affordability has attracted growing numbers of Black and Latino families from California, the Midwest and other corners of Arizona over the past 20 years. Today, the city has a higher percentage of Latino residents than Arizona as a whole.
On the far western reaches of the city, the realities of limited groundwater will soon start coming into focus. There, just west of the jagged White Tank Mountains, earth movers had cleared away creosote bushes to make way for the first homes of a new development called Teravalis, which aspires to build 100,000 homes and 55 million square feet of commercial space.
The development, which is owned by the Howard Hughes Corporation, has gotten approval from state water authorities to build 7,000 homes. But now, the developers of Teravalis and several other projects in the deserts of western Buckeye will have to find other sources of water to get permits to build the rest of the project.
The limits mean that cities on the outer edges of Maricopa County, home to 4.5 million people, must redouble their hunt for new sources of water. They are seeking it through conservation, recycling wastewater, expanding reservoirs or even pumping in treated seawater from Mexico.
Mr. Orsborn, Buckeye's mayor, said the city was in the final stages of buying $ 80 million worth of water from landowners in a rugged mountain basin about 40 miles to the west. That will add enough water to serve about 18,000 households every year for the next century. But, in all, Buckeye officials estimate they will need about 30 times that amount a year.
"It's going to be incredibly expensive," Mr. Orsborn said.
Buckeye is also exploring a range of ideas: new wastewater treatment plants; capturing brackish water near a bend in the Gila River that is currently pumped away; teaming up with other cities to expand a reservoir in the mountains northeast of Phoenix by building a higher dam.
Ultimately, Buckeye's goal is to convince Arizona it has enough sources of water to merit a coveted state "designation" -- what one water-users group calls the "platinum standard" for water supplies in the desert.
Phoenix and most other major cities around Maricopa County have already received these designations from the state, meaning they can continue to grow despite the halt in groundwater-based development.
"Anybody who has complained about urban sprawl, lack of transportation -- those issues are all going to be helped by this change," said Benjamin Ruddell, a professor at Northern Arizona University who studies water use. "It's not the worst thing in the world unless you're a land speculator looking to turn desert into housing."
Land buyers like Anita Verma-Lallian are still bullish on the future of development on the edges of Phoenix. She said undeveloped land with a confirmed water supply has been in greater demand since the state's announcement. Developers are looking for other uses for land without those now-halted state water certificates. Ms. Verma-Lallian said she was working to convert a 2,000-acre parcel once slated for homes into sites for factories or warehouses that are not legally required to show a 100-year water supply the same way subdivisions are.
Intel and a Taiwanese semiconductor company are building new chip plants around Phoenix. In Buckeye, work is underway on a new lithium-ion battery factory.
"There's a lot of that happening," said Ms. Verma-Lallian. "There'll be a lot more industrial development on land that was intended for residential."

“I have neighbors who come up to me and say, ‘What are you doing? Are we running out of water?’” Orsborn said. “It put our community on edge, thinking, ‘What is going on here and do I need to move?’”
No, he tells them. Breathe.
The upheaval was caused by a new state study that found groundwater supplies in the Phoenix area were about 4% short of what is needed for planned growth over the next 100 years. That may feel like a far-off horizon, but it is enough of a change to force the state to rethink its future in the near and long terms.
Now, there are urgent questions about how Arizona should be using its increasingly precious water — for water-guzzling alfalfa and lettuce farms or thirsty new computer chip and battery factories and coffee-creamer manufacturing? For new sprawl or more development inside cities? Could the Phoenix suburbs keep up their frenzied pace of growth? Should they?
“No, we’re not out of business,” said Grady Gammage, a former president of the Central Arizona Project, an aqueduct system that carries Colorado River water to Phoenix and Tucson. “This may slow growth somewhat. I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad thing.”
Arizona has some of the strictest groundwater laws in the country in more regulated areas such as Phoenix. For decades, the state has required new developments to show they have a 100-year supply of water before they can sell lots or break ground.
The projected shortfall means that developers in Phoenix’s fast-growing outskirts can no longer get state approval to build new subdivisions that rely on groundwater wells, meaning they have to get water from somewhere else.
But there are limited sources of new water at a moment when cities and developers across Arizona and other fast-growing Western states are competing for every spare drop. Experts said that could drive up housing costs that have already increased by 51% over the past four years, according to Zillow, and sap Arizona’s appeal as an affordable destination for businesses and new residents.
“It’ll change the way development looks,” Gammage said. “Higher density, less turf, fewer swimming pools.”
Ever since news of the groundwater shortage sent shock waves across the Phoenix area, mayors, developers and business groups have been trying to reassure jittery investors, homeowners and potential new businesses that Arizona still has water, even as the threats of climate change and the shriveling Colorado River begin to reorder its future.
Gov. Katie Hobbs, who has made Arizona’s water supply a focus of her first months in office, said the groundwater decision would not derail any projects that have already been approved and would have little effect on development in most big cities around the Phoenix area. Even on the edge of the suburbs, the state said there was also a supply of 80,000 lots with permission to build that can keep moving forward.
But to some residents around Buckeye, regularly ranked as one of the 10 fastest-growing cities in the country, it felt like an overdrawn account finally coming due — the start of a thirstier new era where the rapidly expanding Phoenix area cannot keep growing by spilling endlessly into the Sonoran desert.
“I worry all the time,” said Trudy Hann, 71, who moved to Buckeye in 1980, when the population was just 3,400. Today, it has more than 110,000 residents, and city officials say they envision 1.5 million people living there — enough to rival the current size of Phoenix.
On Saturday afternoon, Hann and her family huddled under an umbrella in a subdivision of Spanish-tiled homes bordering an unbroken expanse of desert, watching her grandson play flag football on a grassy field fed by treated wastewater.
Inocente Cayetano moved from Goodyear, Arizona, to Buckeye, just 15 miles west, shortly before the pandemic because it was cheap, without a concern about water. He said a starter home cost $100,000 less in Buckeye than it did just one town closer to Phoenix, allowing him to invest his savings in a mobile coffee trailer. The business took off, and he just broke ground on building a storefront location in one of Buckeye’s fancier master-planned communities.
“It’s a little gold mine,” he said.
He trusts the city will have enough water to brew his coffee and fill his faucets.
Buckeye’s affordability has attracted growing numbers of Black and Latino families from California, the Midwest and other corners of Arizona over the past 20 years. Today, the city has a higher percentage of Latino residents than Arizona as a whole.
On the far western reaches of the city, the realities of limited groundwater will soon start coming into focus. There, just west of the jagged White Tank Mountains, earth movers had cleared away creosote bushes to make way for the first homes of a new development called Teravalis, which aspires to build 100,000 homes and 55 million square feet of commercial space.
The development, which is owned by the Howard Hughes Corp., has gotten approval from state water authorities to build 7,000 homes. But now, the developers of Teravalis and several other projects in the deserts of western Buckeye will have to find other sources of water to get permits to build the rest of the project.
The limits mean that cities on the outer edges of Maricopa County, home to 4.5 million people, must redouble their hunt for new sources of water. They are seeking it through conservation, recycling wastewater, expanding reservoirs or even pumping in treated seawater from Mexico.
Orsborn, Buckeye’s mayor, said the city was in the final stages of buying $80 million worth of water from landowners in a rugged mountain basin about 40 miles to the west. That will add enough water to serve about 18,000 households every year for the next century. But, in all, Buckeye officials estimate they will need about 30 times that amount a year.
“It’s going to be incredibly expensive,” Orsborn said.
Buckeye is also exploring a range of ideas: new wastewater treatment plants; capturing brackish water near a bend in the Gila River that is currently pumped away; teaming up with other cities to expand a reservoir in the mountains northeast of Phoenix by building a higher dam.
Ultimately, Buckeye’s goal is to convince Arizona it has enough sources of water to merit a coveted state “designation” — what one water-users group calls the “platinum standard” for water supplies in the desert.
Phoenix and most other major cities around Maricopa County have already received these designations from the state, meaning they can continue to grow despite the halt in groundwater-based development.
“Anybody who has complained about urban sprawl, lack of transportation — those issues are all going to be helped by this change,” said Benjamin Ruddell, a professor at Northern Arizona University who studies water use. “It’s not the worst thing in the world unless you’re a land speculator looking to turn desert into housing.”
Land buyers like Anita Verma-Lallian are still bullish on the future of development on the edges of Phoenix. She said undeveloped land with a confirmed water supply has been in greater demand since the state’s announcement. Developers are looking for other uses for land without those now-halted state water certificates. Verma-Lallian said she was working to convert a 2,000-acre parcel once slated for homes into sites for factories or warehouses that are not legally required to show a 100-year water supply the same way subdivisions are.
Intel and a Taiwanese semiconductor company are building new chip plants around Phoenix. In Buckeye, work is underway on a new lithium-ion battery factory.
“There’s a lot of that happening,” said Verma-Lallian. “There’ll be a lot more industrial development on land that was intended for residential.”

Ex-State Senator Claims Win In Denver's Mayoral Race: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mr. Johnston, a former Colorado state senator, benefited from far more outside spending than his opponent, who conceded on Tuesday night.
Mike Johnston, a former Colorado state senator buoyed by millions of dollars in outside spending, declared victory on Tuesday night in Denver's mayoral election, beating out a candidate who had been vying to become the first woman to hold the office.
Ballots were still left to be counted in the runoff contest -- which is nonpartisan though both candidates are Democrats -- and the city said that the official results would not be released until later this month. But as of Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Johnston had about 55 percent of the vote. His opponent, Kelly Brough, a former head of the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce, had about 45 percent. She conceded on Tuesday night.
"We can build a city that is big enough keep all of us safe, to house all of us, to support all of us," Mr. Johnston said in a victory speech on Tuesday night. "That is our dream of Denver."
Mr. Johnston, 48, and Ms. Brough, 59, had emerged as the top contenders from a crowded field of 16 candidates in the April general election to replace Mayor Michael B. Hancock, a Democrat who has been in office for 12 years. Term limits prevented him from running again.
Both candidates had said that they wanted to make space for more affordable housing, invest in services for homeless people and improve diversity in police recruitment in Colorado's capital city. But Mr. Johnston appeared to have more support from left-leaning voters, and from wealthy donors outside the state.
Ms. Brough said in a speech that she had called Mr. Johnston to concede. "We set out to restore the promise of Denver," she said. "And I still believe in this campaign, and the work we did."
A handful of more progressive candidates had considerable support from voters before the April 4 election, but they seemed to sap each other's momentum as the first round of voting neared.
Tami Matthews, 53, a marketing director, said she had voted for Mr. Johnston in the runoff because he seemed like a creative politician who was more progressive than Ms. Brough. She said she liked his support for more regulations to address climate change, as well as his plans to build small communities of tiny homes for the city's homeless population.
Denver voters had been excited about the idea of having a woman as mayor, Ms. Matthews said. "But I think that there were so many other better women candidates," she added, mentioning progressive candidates who hadn't made it past the April election.
Still, she said she had voted for Mr. Johnston both times, even though she did not like the reports of his donations from out of state. "That does give me some heartburn," Ms. Matthews said.
In the 12 years under Mr. Hancock's administration, Denver has seen major population growth -- despite some losses during the coronavirus pandemic -- and many of the challenges that come with it. Housing costs have risen, and homelessness has gotten worse.
"Whoever wins I think will have, at least for a while, a fair mandate to make some pretty significant public policy shifts on these issues," Seth Masket, the director of the Center on American Politics at the University of Denver, said in an interview before the early results were in. "I think a lot of other mayors of similar-size cities will be looking at Denver, just to see what comes out of this."
Mr. Johnston -- a former teacher, principal and education adviser to President Barack Obama -- was first elected to the State Senate in 2009 and served until 2017, when he reached his term limit. Since then, he has run unsuccessfully both for governor and for the United States Senate.
More recently, he was the chief executive of Gary Community Ventures, an organization that combines philanthropy, investing and political funding. There, he played a leading role in advancing Proposition 123, an initiative to dedicate hundreds of millions of dollars annually to providing affordable housing. It was approved by Colorado voters last year.
Before serving as the chief executive of the city Chamber of Commerce, Ms. Brough was Denver's head of human resources, and she served as chief of staff for former Mayor John Hickenlooper, who is now a U.S. senator.
She was endorsed by Democratic leaders in the city and state, as well as the city's police union and its Republican Party. But endorsements from some of the progressive candidates who were edged out of the April election bolstered Mr. Johnston's chances in the runoff.
His campaign also benefited from far more outside spending than did Ms. Brough's, public records show.
Advancing Denver, a super PAC that supported Mr. Johnston but was not formally affiliated with his campaign, received more than $ 2 million from donors including Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn, and Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City.
Both men also supported Mr. Johnston's unsuccessful run for governor in 2018, The Colorado Sun reported.
A Better Denver, a super PAC that supported Ms. Brough's candidacy, was funded by donors including the National Association of Realtors, which spent more than $ 400,000.
Although Tuesday was Election Day, votes for the runoff contest have been rolling in since last month. That is because registered voters in Denver receive their ballots in the mail, giving them the option to send it back, drop it off or show up in person to cast a ballot on Election Day. Ms. Brough dropped off her ballot last week, and Mr. Johnston submitted his on Sunday.

Heat Reach the Finals the Hard Way, Which Is How They Like to Do Things: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Heat, just the second eighth seed to reach the championship round, nearly blew a 3-0 series lead against the Celtics. Next they face the top-seeded Denver Nuggets.
The N.B.A.'s Eastern Conference championship trophy had found its way to the visiting locker room at TD Garden on Monday night. Set atop a couple of packing trunks with metallic trim, the trophy -- a sterling silver replica of a basketball -- was an attraction for the Miami Heat, who had earned it the hard way with their stunning 103-84 victory over the Boston Celtics in Game 7 of the conference finals.
Players and staff members, clad in N.B.A. finals hats and T-shirts, positioned themselves next to the trophy for photographs and selfies, memorializing the team's beautiful struggle before a late-night flight to Denver, where they will face the Nuggets for the N.B.A. championship starting Thursday.
"We never thought it would be easy," Miami forward Bam Adebayo said.
The Heat's resurgence as the East's No. 8 seed has surprised everyone but them. Even when they were scuffling through the regular season, losing nearly as often as they won, Coach Erik Spoelstra stuck with his approach. Spoelstra said they were capable of improving if they continued to focus on their daily work. There was nothing especially sexy about it -- meeting after frustrating losses, watching film, practicing hard.
"I think probably people can relate to this team," Spoelstra said. "Professional sports is just kind of a reflection sometimes of life, that things don't always go your way. The inevitable setbacks happen, and it's how you deal with that collectively. There's a lot of different ways that it can go: It can sap your spirit. It can take a team down, for whatever reason.
"With this group, it's steeled us and made us closer and made us tougher."
They will need that toughness against the top-seeded Nuggets, who secured their first trip to the N.B.A. finals by completing a sweep of the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference finals a week ago. The Heat are just the second eighth seed, after the 1998-99 Knicks, to reach the championship round under the current playoff format.
"Everybody's confidence is so high," said Heat forward Jimmy Butler, who was named the most valuable player of the series after scoring 28 points in Game 7. "We have belief that we can do something incredibly special. So we are going to hit the ground running when we get to Denver, and I like our chances."
The Nuggets, who are rested and deep, are most likely the Heat's toughest challenge to date. At Butler's postgame news conference, he was asked how he and his teammates planned to slow Nikola Jokic, the Nuggets' star center and a two-time league M.V.P. Butler said he was giving himself until midnight -- it was 11:42 p.m. at the time -- before he began to think about the coming series.
"I don't know," he said. "I've got two days to figure that out."
At this late stage, though, the Heat appear to savor absurd tests. They traveled a long road just to reach the conference finals. They had to defeat the Chicago Bulls in a play-in game to slip into the postseason. They proceeded to lose two rotation players, Tyler Herro and Victor Oladipo, to injuries in their first-round series with the East's No. 1 seed, the Milwaukee Bucks.
After Miami won the first three games of its series with Boston, Spoelstra said "a lot of pent-up stuff" had been fueling his team but declined to elaborate. His players were more forthcoming: They recalled being eliminated by the Celtics in the conference finals last season, an especially disappointing exit since the Heat were the East's top seed and the series went seven games.
This time around, the Heat built a 3-0 series lead -- and promptly lost three in a row, a demoralizing stretch that included a brutal, last-second loss in Game 6 when the Celtics' Derrick White converted a put-back layup at the buzzer off an errant 3-pointer. The Heat could have crumbled. Instead, they dipped into their bottomless well of perseverance.
"Sometimes you have to suffer for the things that you want," Spoelstra said, adding: "Sometimes you have to laugh at the things that make you cry."
On Monday, before a hostile Boston crowd that was at a fever pitch during player introductions, the Heat seemed intent on drowning out the noise by relying on their defense. The Celtics missed all 10 of their 3-point attempts in the first quarter. (Making matters worse, Jayson Tatum, the Celtics' best player, appeared limited after he sprained his left ankle on the team's opening possession.) The Heat led by as many as 17 points before halftime.
Caleb Martin, a small forward who moved into the starting lineup for Games 6 and 7, was the Heat's most consistent player of the series. He had 26 points in Game 7 and made 11 of his 16 shots, including four 3-pointers.
Gabe Vincent, the team's starting point guard, played the final two games with a sprained ankle. And Duncan Robinson came off the bench to make timely 3-pointers.
"We have some hoopers," Butler said. "We have some real-deal basketball players that can score, can defend and can pass and can win games for us."
The Heat's role players were the difference against the Celtics, who figured to make another deep playoff run after losing to the Golden State Warriors in the N.B.A. finals last season. But obstacles -- both predictable and unforeseen -- hindered them before they even convened for the preseason.
Atop the list was the sudden absence of Ime Udoka, who, as the Celtics' first-year head coach last season, left his defense-minded imprint on the team. But in September, less than a week before training camp, the Celtics suspended him for the season for "violations of team policies."
The entire situation cast an unwelcome shadow on the Celtics as they sought to focus on the season ahead. "It's been hell," Marcus Smart, the team's starting point guard and last season's defensive player of the year, said at the time.
Instead of going outside the organization to hire an experienced coach as Udoka's replacement, the team prioritized continuity by temporarily promoting Joe Mazzulla, who had been an assistant on Udoka's staff.
The Celtics named Mazzulla as their permanent head coach in February and officially severed ties with Udoka, whom the Houston Rockets hired as head coach last month.
But Boston slumped over the final weeks of the regular season, slipping to the No. 2 seed in the East behind Milwaukee, and needed six games to eliminate the Atlanta Hawks in the first round.
The pressure only mounted on Mazzulla -- and on the team's two stars, Tatum and Jaylen Brown -- during the Celtics' conference semifinal matchup with the Philadelphia 76ers. Tatum and Brown were inconsistent as the series stretched to seven games.
But after Tatum scored 51 points in a series-clinching tour de force against the 76ers, the Celtics ran into the Heat, a savvy and experienced opponent with payback in mind.
The Heat were not about to let up against the Celtics -- not after a season of growth under Spoelstra, not with Butler filling his more unsung teammates with confidence, and not against an opponent that had buried Miami's championship dream a year ago.
"Nobody is satisfied," Butler said. "We haven't done anything. We don't play just to win the Eastern Conference -- we play to win the whole thing."

City Moves To Regulate Use of A.I. For Hiring: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: European lawmakers are finishing work on an A.I. act. The Biden administration and leaders in Congress have their plans for reining in artificial intelligence. Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, maker of the A.I. sensation ChatGPT, recommended the creation of a federal agency with oversight and licensing authority in Senate testimony last week. And the topic came up at the Group of 7 summit in Japan.
Amid the sweeping plans and pledges, New York City has emerged as a modest pioneer in A.I. regulation.
The city government passed a law in 2021 and adopted specific rules last month for one high-stakes application of the technology: hiring and promotion decisions. Enforcement begins in July.
The city's law requires companies using A.I. software in hiring to notify candidates that an automated system is being used. It also requires companies to have independent auditors check the technology annually for bias. Candidates can request and be told what data is being collected and analyzed. Companies will be fined for violations.
New York City's focused approach represents an important front in A.I. regulation. At some point, the broad-stroke principles developed by governments and international organizations, experts say, must be translated into details and definitions. Who is being affected by the technology? What are the benefits and harms? Who can intervene, and how?
"Without a concrete use case, you are not in a position to answer those questions," said Julia Stoyanovich, an associate professor at New York University and director of its Center for Responsible A.I.
But even before it takes effect, the New York City law has been a magnet for criticism. Public interest advocates say it doesn't go far enough, while business groups say it is impractical.
The complaints from both camps point to the challenge of regulating A.I., which is advancing at a torrid pace with unknown consequences, stirring enthusiasm and anxiety.
Uneasy compromises are inevitable.
Ms. Stoyanovich is concerned that the city law has loopholes that may weaken it. "But it's much better than not having a law," she said. "And until you try to regulate, you won't learn how."
The law applies to companies with workers in New York City, but labor experts expect it to influence practices nationally. At least four states -- California, New Jersey, New York and Vermont -- and the District of Columbia are also working on laws to regulate A.I. in hiring. And Illinois and Maryland have enacted laws limiting the use of specific A.I. technologies, often for workplace surveillance and the screening of job candidates.
The New York City law emerged from a clash of sharply conflicting viewpoints. The City Council passed it during the final days of the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio. Rounds of hearings and public comments, more than 100,000 words, came later -- overseen by the city's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, the rule-making agency.
The result, some critics say, is overly sympathetic to business interests.
"What could have been a landmark law was watered down to lose effectiveness," said Alexandra Givens, president of the Center for Democracy & Technology, a policy and civil rights organization.
That's because the law defines an "automated employment decision tool" as technology used "to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making," she said. The rules adopted by the city appear to interpret that phrasing narrowly so that A.I. software will require an audit only if it is the lone or primary factor in a hiring decision or is used to overrule a human, Ms. Givens said.
That leaves out the main way the automated software is used, she said, with a hiring manager invariably making the final choice. The potential for A.I.-driven discrimination, she said, typically comes in screening hundreds or thousands of candidates down to a handful or in targeted online recruiting to generate a pool of candidates.
Ms. Givens also criticized the law for limiting the kinds of groups measured for unfair treatment. It covers bias by sex, race and ethnicity, but not discrimination against older workers or those with disabilities.
"My biggest concern is that this becomes the template nationally when we should be asking much more of our policymakers," Ms. Givens said.
The law was narrowed to sharpen it and make sure it was focused and enforceable, city officials said. The Council and the worker protection agency heard from many voices, including public-interest activists and software companies. Its goal was to weigh trade-offs between innovation and potential harm, officials said.
"This is a significant regulatory success toward ensuring that A.I. technology is used ethically and responsibly," said Robert Holden, who was the chair of the Council committee on technology when the law was passed and remains a committee member.
New York City is trying to address new technology in the context of federal workplace laws with guidelines on hiring that date to the 1970s. The main Equal Employment Opportunity Commission rule states that no practice or method of selection used by employers should have a "disparate impact" on a legally protected group like women or minorities.
Businesses have criticized the law. In a filing this year, the Software Alliance, a trade group that includes Microsoft, SAP and Workday, said the requirement for independent audits of A.I. was "not feasible" because "the auditing landscape is nascent," lacking standards and professional oversight bodies.
But a nascent field is a market opportunity. The A.I. audit business, experts say, is only going to grow. It is already attracting law firms, consultants and start-ups.
Companies that sell A.I. software to assist in hiring and promotion decisions have generally come to embrace regulation. Some have already undergone outside audits. They see the requirement as a potential competitive advantage, providing proof that their technology expands the pool of job candidates for companies and increases opportunity for workers.
"We believe we can meet the law and show what good A.I. looks like," said Roy Wang, general counsel of Eightfold AI, a Silicon Valley start-up that produces software used to assist hiring managers.
The New York City law also takes an approach to regulating A.I. that may become the norm. The law's key measurement is an "impact ratio," or a calculation of the effect of using the software on a protected group of job candidates. It does not delve into how an algorithm makes decisions, a concept known as "explainability."
In life-affecting applications like hiring, critics say, people have a right to an explanation of how a decision was made. But A.I. like ChatGPT-style software is becoming more complex, perhaps putting the goal of explainable A.I. out of reach, some experts say.
"The focus becomes the output of the algorithm, not the working of the algorithm," said Ashley Casovan, executive director of the Responsible AI Institute, which is developing certifications for the safe use of A.I. applications in the workplace, health care and finance.

Full text: Or, at least, he kinda-sorta tries to rebel in this romantic, futuristic fable from the Portuguese director João Pedro Rodrigues.
"Will-o'-the-Wisp," an off-balance provocation from the Portuguese titillater João Pedro Rodrigues, is a prank in fancy dress, a plastic boutonniere that squirts battery acid. The joke is on everyone, particularly the powerful and those holding out hope that the powerful will save the planet.
Portugal booted its monarchy in 1910, but in this alternate timeline, the royals still reign. When the do-gooder prince, Alfredo (Mauro Costa), shocks his family by becoming a firefighter, Rodrigues drops him into an eroticized firehouse for a beefcake feast, concocting a calendar shoot to bend the fighters into, um, suggestive poses. Later, the director assembles a slide show of genitalia which the waify blond prince and his working-class Black lover, Afonso (André Cabral), liken to various climates. (Petrified forest, barren grassland -- you won't have to strain your imagination to see the resemblance.)
The movie, co-written by Rodrigues, João Rui Guerra da Mata and Paulo Lopes Graça, opens with Alfredo on his deathbed in 2069 -- the film's most subtle sexual reference. Then it flashes back to the prince's youth, where he's escorted through ancient pines by the king (Miguel Loureiro). Some viewers might recognize the woods as the Leiria Pine Forest whose timber and sap built the ships that built the Portuguese empire. The Leiria was decimated by wildfires in 2017, and the interstitial titles -- "Slash and Burn," "Charred," and so on -- make it clear that a blaze is coming for everyone. Smoke wafts through the palace while the conservative queen (Margarida Vila-Nova) putters around anxiously snuffing candles.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The symbolism is blunt, and the film's style, striking and severe. Scenes are staged as precisely as painted tableaus, with handsome shadows and gratuitous whippets. At one point, the prince stands at the dinner table and delivers Greta Thunberg's U.N. Climate Action Summit address straight to the camera -- "The eyes of all future generations are upon you" -- as though to convince the audience he kinda-sorta tried to get his parents to do something. Unmoved, his mother instead fusses over a more politically correct title for the family's 18th-century oil portrait, a mocking depiction of eight Black and Indigenous dwarfs who were collected by Queen Maria I of Portugal (and of Brazil, where she was called Maria the Mad).
We already know that the prince won't grow up to fix much. (Ingeniously, the cinematographer Rui Poças and the sound editor Nuno Carvalho evoke a desolate, airship-patrolled future using only a shadow and a loudspeaker.) But he keeps that portrait, which inspires reveries of his affair with Afonso. Their fleeting moments of joy make up the bulk of the running time. Rodrigues's mind is on social upheaval, but his heart is with Afonso's lavishly lit abdomen and the parts just below.
Rodrigues blows past good taste with an explicit tête-à-tête in the scorched forest where his brave leading men pant racial slurs into each other's nether regions. It's a rough watch, but Rodrigues balances this shocker with a scene of shocking loveliness: a dance number where the pair's slight stiffness makes their burst of emotional expression feel tender and sincere.

How to Change a Life for 50 Cents: [Op-Ed]

Full text: MAKENI, Sierra Leone -- Brace yourself for a gross fact: Some 1.5 billion of the world's people have worms living in their bodies, weakening them and occasionally disfiguring them. Yet eliminating the worms is one of the most tantalizing and inexpensive of health fixes.
Think of it this way: For the cost of keeping a single American dog dewormed, we could free more than 100 children abroad from the burden of worms.
I'm on my annual win-a-trip journey, in which I take a university student along on a reporting trip in hopes of boosting interest among young people in global issues that don't always get the attention they deserve -- like worms in a billion bellies.
My student winner is Maddie Bender, a recent graduate of Yale University -- the trip was delayed by the pandemic -- and I brought her to rural Sierra Leone because what's happening in these villages underscores how cheap it can be to register progress: Children can be dewormed for about 50 cents each. At a typical two dewormings a year, that's $ 1 annually, compared with almost $ 140 a year for the Heartgard deworming medicine that my dog gets.
Worms don't normally endanger lives, but they can cause anemia, sap energy and, in some cases, result in worse harms. Maddie and I came here to see a program to eliminate an unusually devastating kind of worm that causes elephantiasis, a disease so named because it causes a person's legs to swell up like an elephant's.
That's what happened to Rukoh Kana, an emaciated woman with a left leg that is hugely swollen. She has taken deworming medicines that have killed the worms, but the deformity itself cannot be reversed.
"I used to work as a farmer and gardener, but now I can't," Kana told us.
One gauge of the stigma of elephantiasis: Other villagers mocked Kana and then began to accuse her of being a witch. Villagers were summoned, and a professional witch hunter twirled a pole that supposedly would point to any witch present. In the end there was a purification process, a village conflict and a chain of punishment that ended in the killing of three men.
All because of worms.
Worms once inhabited perhaps 40 percent of Americans living in the Southern states, but a precursor of the Rockefeller Foundation dewormed American children early in the 20th century and then saw large gains in the ability of kids to study and learn. Yet despite easy fixes, worms still inhabit the bodies of 1.5 billion people around the world, according to a World Health Organization estimate.
The good news is that elephantiasis, the disease that caused Kana to be accused of witchcraft, is on its way out. This is the only district in Sierra Leone where the disease is still endemic, and the horror it evokes may soon be a memory. Credit for elimination goes in part to Helen Keller Intl, a nonprofit that is working to eliminate it and other tropical diseases.
In my reporting career, I've seen heartening declines in elephantiasis and other ailments caused by worms. It used to be that children sometimes had so many worms that they would die from intestinal blockage; doctors say that is very rare now.
"Many millions of people are now liberated from these debilitating conditions for generations to come, diseases that have been haunting humanity for millennia," said Shawn Baker of Helen Keller Intl.
Men with elephantiasis, also known as lymphatic filariasis, sometimes suffer a particular humiliation: The disease can cause not only hugely swollen legs but also grotesquely swollen scrotums.
I spoke with five men with elephantiasis who had scrotums swollen to the size of a grapefruit or small soccer ball. Tens of millions of men suffer from this condition.
"It's very uncomfortable," said Amidu Thullah, 35, a farmer whose wife left him with their children because of the ailment. It is hard for Thullah to fit into pants or walk around, and it leaves men with this condition targets of mockery and taunts.
Yet while swollen legs cannot be corrected, there is now hope for men suffering the indignity of inflated scrotums. Helen Keller Intl is arranging free surgery, financed by the END Fund, a group that fights worms, to reduce the scrotums of those with this ailment. The cost of the surgery is about $ 150, and it's transformative. Two men here have had the surgery, and the others are eagerly looking forward to it.
"The shame is gone," Alpha Bangura, 38, who has recovered from the surgery, told me. "I feel like a normal human being again."
People sometimes ask me skeptically if humanitarian aid does any good. No one seeing the toll of elephantiasis here as it wanes or the relief of these men who have been given their lives back could doubt it. And Americans can be proud that the U.S.A.I.D. is a major funder of deworming efforts.
Early in my career, I used to think that in the age-old battle between worms and humans, it might be worms that had the advantage. Now, even in the poorest countries in the world, humans are gaining ground. At a time of so much grim news, that's a win for humanity.

Microsoft Says New A.I. Nears Human Insight: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When computer scientists at Microsoft started to experiment with a new artificial intelligence system last year, they asked it to solve a puzzle that should have required an intuitive understanding of the physical world.
"Here we have a book, nine eggs, a laptop, a bottle and a nail," they asked. "Please tell me how to stack them onto each other in a stable manner."
The researchers were startled by the ingenuity of the A.I. system's answer. Put the eggs on the book, it said. Arrange the eggs in three rows with space between them. Make sure you don't crack them.
"Place the laptop on top of the eggs, with the screen facing down and the keyboard facing up," it wrote. "The laptop will fit snugly within the boundaries of the book and the eggs, and its flat and rigid surface will provide a stable platform for the next layer."
The clever suggestion made the researchers wonder whether they were witnessing a new kind of intelligence. In March, they published a 155-page research paper arguing that the system was a step toward artificial general intelligence, or A.G.I., which is shorthand for a machine that can do anything the human brain can do. The paper was published on an internet research repository.
Microsoft, the first major tech company to release a paper making such a bold claim, stirred one of the tech world's testiest debates: Is the industry building something akin to human intelligence? Or are some of the industry's brightest minds letting their imaginations get the best of them?
"I started off being very skeptical -- and that evolved into a sense of frustration, annoyance, maybe even fear," Peter Lee, who leads research at Microsoft, said. "You think: Where the heck is this coming from?"
Microsoft's research paper, provocatively called "Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence," goes to the heart of what technologists have been working toward -- and fearing -- for decades. If they build a machine that works like the human brain or even better, it could change the world. But it could also be dangerous.
And it could also be nonsense. Making A.G.I. claims can be a reputation killer for computer scientists. What one researcher believes is a sign of intelligence can easily be explained away by another, and the debate often sounds more appropriate to a philosophy club than a computer lab. Last year, Google fired a researcher who claimed that a similar A.I. system was sentient, a step beyond what Microsoft has claimed. A sentient system would not just be intelligent. It would be able to sense or feel what is happening in the world around it.
But some believe the industry has in the past year or so inched toward something that can't be explained away: A new A.I. system that is coming up with humanlike answers and ideas that weren't programmed into it.
Microsoft has reorganized parts of its research labs to include multiple groups dedicated to exploring the idea. One will be run by Sébastien Bubeck, who was the lead author on the Microsoft A.G.I. paper.
About five years ago, companies like Google, Microsoft and OpenAI began building large language models, or L.L.M.s. Those systems often spend months analyzing vast amounts of digital text, including books, Wikipedia articles and chat logs. By pinpointing patterns in that text, they learned to generate text of their own, including term papers, poetry and computer code. They can even carry on a conversation.
The technology the Microsoft researchers were working with, OpenAI's GPT-4, is considered the most powerful of those systems. Microsoft is a close partner of OpenAI and has invested $ 13 billion in the San Francisco company.
The researchers included Dr. Bubeck, a 38-year-old French expatriate and former Princeton University professor. One of the first things he and his colleagues did was ask GPT-4 to write a mathematical proof showing that there were infinite prime numbers and do it in a way that rhymed.
The technology's poetic proof was so impressive -- both mathematically and linguistically -- that he found it hard to understand what he was chatting with. "At that point, I was like: What is going on?" he said in March during a seminar at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
For several months, he and his colleagues documented complex behavior exhibited by the system and believed it demonstrated a "deep and flexible understanding" of human concepts and skills.
When people use GPT-4, they are "amazed at its ability to generate text," Dr. Lee said. "But it turns out to be way better at analyzing and synthesizing and evaluating and judging text than generating it."
When they asked the system to draw a unicorn using a programming language called TiKZ, it instantly generated a program that could draw a unicorn. When they removed the stretch of code that drew the unicorn's horn and asked the system to modify the program so that it once again drew a unicorn, it did exactly that.
They asked it to write a program that took in a person's age, sex, weight, height and blood test results and judged whether they were at risk of diabetes. They asked it to write a letter of support for an electron as a U.S. presidential candidate, in the voice of Mahatma Gandhi, addressed to his wife. And they asked it to write a Socratic dialogue that explored the misuses and dangers of L.L.M.s.
It did it all in a way that seemed to show an understanding of fields as disparate as politics, physics, history, computer science, medicine and philosophy while combining its knowledge.
"All of the things I thought it wouldn't be able to do? It was certainly able to do many of them -- if not most of them," Dr. Bubeck said.
Some A.I. experts saw the Microsoft paper as an opportunistic effort to make big claims about a technology that no one quite understood. Researchers also argue that general intelligence requires a familiarity with the physical world, which GPT-4 in theory does not have.
"The 'Sparks of A.G.I.' is an example of some of these big companies co-opting the research paper format into P.R. pitches," said Maarten Sap, a researcher and professor at Carnegie Mellon University. "They literally acknowledge in their paper's introduction that their approach is subjective and informal and may not satisfy the rigorous standards of scientific evaluation."
Dr. Bubeck and Dr. Lee said they were unsure how to describe the system's behavior and ultimately settled on "Sparks of A.G.I." because they thought it would capture the imagination of other researchers.
Because Microsoft researchers were testing an early version of GPT-4 that had not been fine-tuned to avoid hate speech, misinformation and other unwanted content, the claims made in the paper cannot be verified by outside experts. Microsoft says that the system available to the public is not as powerful as the version they tested.
There are times when systems like GPT-4 seem to mimic human reasoning, but there are also times when they seem terribly dense. "These behaviors are not always consistent," Ece Kamar, a research lead at Microsoft, said.
Alison Gopnik, a professor of psychology who is part of the A.I. research group at the University of California, Berkeley, said that systems like GPT-4 were no doubt powerful, but it was not clear that the text generated by these systems was the result of something like human reasoning or common sense.
"When we see a complicated system or machine, we anthropomorphize it; everybody does that -- people who are working in the field and people who aren't," Dr. Gopnik said. "But thinking about this as a constant comparison between A.I. and humans -- like some sort of game show competition -- is just not the right way to think about it."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Price increases cooled, capping months of declines. The details held hints of hope.
Inflation slowed for a 10th straight month in April, a closely watched report on Wednesday showed, good news for American families struggling under the burden of higher costs and for policymakers in Washington as they try to wrangle rapid price increases.
The Consumer Price Index climbed 4.9 percent in April from a year earlier, less than the 5 percent that economists in a Bloomberg survey had expected. Inflation has come down notably from a peak just above 9 percent last summer, though it has remained far higher than the 2 percent annual gains that were normal before the pandemic.
Cheaper prices for airline tickets, new cars and groceries including eggs and produce helped to pull inflation lower last month even as gas prices and rents climbed briskly. In an important shift, prices for some services slowed -- a positive for the Federal Reserve, which has been raising interest rates to slow the economy and wrestle inflation lower. Central bankers have been watching services costs carefully in part because they have been proving stubborn.
The report also provided welcome news for President Biden. Inflation has plagued voters for more than two years now, weighing on the president's approval ratings. As prices climb less dramatically with each passing month, they may become a less pressing concern.
Yet economists warned against overstating the progress: While inflation is showing positive signs of cooling, a chunk of the decline since last summer has come as supply chains have healed. With that low-hanging fruit gone, it could be a long and bumpy path back to a normal inflation rate.
"Inflation is still sticky; I don't think that the Fed is going to look at this and cut rates, or heave an especially big sigh of relief," said Priya Misra, head of global rates research at TD Securities. "Not so fast. We can't draw the conclusion that the inflation problem is over."
Even so, stock prices jumped in response to the data as investors -- who tend to prefer lower interest rates -- greeted it as good news for the Fed.
After stripping out food and fuel to get a sense of the underlying trend in price increases -- what economists call a core measure -- consumer prices climbed 5.5 percent from a year earlier, a slight deceleration from 5.6 percent in the previous reading.
And a closely watched measure of services prices outside of housing costs pulled back even more meaningfully. That was an encouraging sign that a stubborn component of inflation is finally on the verge of cracking, but it was also driven partly by a moderation in travel expenses that might not last, said Laura Rosner-Warburton, senior economist at MacroPolicy Perspectives.
That slowdown offered "a little bit of good news, but also probably a little bit of a head fake," she said.
While inflation has been gradually cooling for months, it has remained too elevated for policymakers.
Much of the slowing in price increases has come as supply chain bottlenecks that emerged during the depths of the pandemic have cleared up, allowing goods shortages to ease. Energy prices have also moderated after a surge in summer 2022 that was tied to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
But underlying trends that could keep inflation persistently high over time have remained intact, including unusually strong wage growth, which could prod companies to try to charge more.
That is one reason Fed officials have been paying such close attention to service prices: They tend to be more responsive to strength in the economy, and they can be difficult to slow down once they pick up.
There are reasons to hope for more measured services inflation in coming months. Rents have begun to climb more slowly in market-based trackers, which should begin to show up in the official inflation data.
But the question is whether the Fed has slowed the economy enough for other service prices -- for things like travel, manicures, child care and health care -- to follow suit.
Central bankers have raised interest rates over the past year at the fastest pace since the 1980s to slow lending and weigh down growth, lifting borrowing costs above 5 percent as of this month.
Those increases have made it more expensive to borrow money to buy a house or expand a business. As growth cools and companies compete less aggressively for workers, wage growth has already begun to slow. That chain reaction is expected to sap demand, which could make it harder for firms to increase prices without scaring away customers.
But the full effect of the Fed's moves is still playing out. The fallout could be intensified by a series of recent high-profile bank failures, which might make other lenders nervous and prompt them to pull back on extending credit.
And Congress is approaching a showdown over raising the nation's debt limit, which could also shape the outlook: If markets panic as Democrats and Republicans struggle to reach a deal and investors worry that the American government will fail to pay its bills, that could trickle out to hurt the economy.
Democrats have warned that the brinkmanship could undermine progress in a strong economy with slowing inflation, while Republicans argued on Wednesday that rapid inflation is evidence that they are correct to demand spending cuts.
With so many factors poised to weaken the economy, Fed officials are now assessing whether they need to raise borrowing costs further, or whether their moves so far will suffice to guide inflation back to normal. John C. Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, told reporters in New York on Tuesday that the Fed's next decision -- to lift rates or to pause -- would hinge on incoming data.
"We'll adjust policy going forward based on what we see out there," he said.
Policymakers will receive the consumer price report for May on June 13, the day before their decision, but officials typically give markets at least a hint of what they might do with rates ahead of time. Given that, central bankers are likely to pay close attention to the April inflation report.
Fed officials will also receive May jobs data and a reading of the personal consumption expenditures price index -- the measure they officially target in their 2 percent inflation goal, but one that comes out with more of a delay -- before their next meeting. The personal consumption measure builds partly on the data from the consumer price report.
For now, the fresh inflation figures probably aren't enough to convince policymakers that they should change course and reduce interest rates soon, economists said.
"It probably keeps them on track to pause at the next meeting," Ms. Rosner-Warburton said.

Turning Over Her Office Inbox to A.I.: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Inbox management can be mind-numbing. You might have wondered, couldn't a robot do this?
Five hours is enough time to watch a Mets game. It is enough time to listen to the Spice Girls' "Spice" album (40 minutes), Paul Simon's "Paul Simon" album (42 minutes) and Gustav Mahler's third symphony (his longest). It is enough time to roast a chicken, text your friends that you've roasted a chicken and prepare for an impromptu dinner party.
Or you could spend it checking your email. Five hours is about how long many workers spend on email each day. And 90 minutes on the messaging platform Slack.
It's a weird thing, workplace chatter like email and Slack: It's sometimes the most delightful and human part of the work day. It can also be mind-numbing to manage your inbox -- to the extent you might wonder, couldn't a robot do this?
In late April, I decided to see what it would be like to let artificial intelligence into my life. I resolved to do an experiment. For one week, I would write all my work communication -- emails, Slack messages, pitches, follow-ups with sources -- through ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence language model from the research lab OpenAI. I didn't tell colleagues until the end of the week (except in a few instances of personal weakness). I downloaded a Chrome extension that drafted email responses directly into my inbox. But most of the time, I ended up writing detailed prompts into ChatGPT, asking it to be either witty or formal depending on the situation.
What resulted was a roller coaster, emotionally and in terms of the amount of content I was generating. I started the week inundating my teammates (sorry) to see how they would react. At a certain point, I lost patience with the bot and developed a newfound appreciation for phone calls.
My bot, unsurprisingly, couldn't match the emotional tone of any online conversation. And I spend a lot of the week, because of hybrid work, having online conversations.
The impulse to chat with teammates all day isn't wrong. Most people know the thrill (and also, usefulness) of office friendships from psychologists, economists, TV sitcoms and our own lives; my colleague sends me photos of her baby in increasingly chic onesies every few days, and nothing makes me happier. But the amount of time workers feel they must devote to digitally communicating is undoubtedly excessive -- and for some, easy to make the case for handing over to artificial intelligence.
.
The release of generative A.I. tools has raised all sorts of enormous and thorny questions about work. There are fears about what jobs will be replaced by A.I. in 10 years -- Paralegals? Personal assistants? Movie and television writers are currently on strike, and one issue they're fighting for is limiting the use of A.I. by the studios. There are also fears about the toxic and untruthful information A.I. can spread in an online ecosystem already rife with misinformation.
The question driving my experiment was far narrower: Will we miss our old ways of working if A.I. takes over the drudgery of communication? And would my colleagues even know, or would they be Chatfished?
My experiment started on a Monday morning with a friendly Slack message from an editor in Seoul who had sent me the link to a study analyzing humor across more than 2,000 TED and TEDx Talks. "Pity the researchers," the editor wrote to me. I asked ChatGPT to say something clever in reply, and the robot wrote: "I mean, I love a good TED Talk as much as the next person, but that's just cruel and unusual punishment!"
While not at all resembling a sentence I would type, this seemed inoffensive. I hit send.
I had begun the experiment feeling that it was important to be generous in spirit toward my robot co-conspirator. By Tuesday morning, though, I found that my to-do list was straining the limits of my robot's pseudo-human wit. It so happened that my colleagues on the Business desk were planning a party. Renee, one of the party planners, asked me if I could help draft the invitation.
"Maybe with your journalistic voice, you can write a nicer sentence than I just have," Renee wrote to me on Slack.
I couldn't tell her that my use of "journalistic voice" was a sore subject that week. I asked ChatGPT to craft a funny sentence about refreshments. "I am thrilled to announce that our upcoming party will feature an array of delicious cheese plates," the robot wrote. "Just to spice things up a bit (pun intended), we may even have some with a business-themed twist!"
Renee was unimpressed and, ironically, wrote to me: "OK, wait, let me get the ChatGPT to make a sentence."
Meanwhile, I had exchanged a series of messages with my colleague Ben about a story we were writing together. In a moment of anxiety, I called him to let him know it was ChatGPT writing the Slack messages, not me, and he admitted that he had wondered whether I was annoyed at him. "I thought I'd broken you!" he said.
When we got off the phone, Ben messaged me: "Robot-Emma is very polite, but in a way I'm slightly concerned might hide her intention to murder me in my sleep."
"I want to assure you that you can sleep peacefully knowing that your safety and security are not at risk," my bot replied. "Take care and sleep well."
Given the amount of time I spend online talking to colleagues -- about the news, story ideas, occasionally "Love Is Blind" -- it was disconcerting stripping those communications of any personality.
But it's not at all far-fetched. Microsoft earlier this year introduced a product, Microsoft 365 Copilot, that could handle all the tasks I asked ChatGPT to do and far more. I recently saw it in action when Microsoft's corporate vice president, Jon Friedman, showed me how Copilot could read emails he'd received, summarize them and then draft possible replies. Copilot can take notes during meetings, analyze spreadsheet data and identify problems that might arise in a project.
I asked Mr. Friedman if Copilot could mimic his sense of humor. He told me that the product wasn't quite there yet, although it could make valiant comedic attempts. (He has asked it, for example, for pickleball jokes, and it delivered: "Why did the pickleball player refuse to play doubles? They couldn't dill with the extra pressure!")
Of course, he continued, Copilot's purpose is loftier than mediocre comedy. "Most of humanity spends way too much time consumed with what we call the drudgery of work, getting through our inbox," Mr. Friedman said. "These things just sap our creativity and our energy."
Mr. Friedman recently asked Copilot to draft a memo, using his notes, recommending one of his employees for a promotion. The recommendation worked. He estimated that two hours' worth of work was completed in six minutes.
To some, though, the time savings aren't worth the peculiarity of outsourcing relationships.
"In the future, you're going to get an email and someone will be like 'Did you even read it?' And you'll be like 'no' and then they'll be like 'Well I didn't write the response to you,"' said Matt Buechele, 33, a comedy writer who also makes TikToks about office communications. "It'll be robots going back and forth to each other, circling back."
Mr. Buechele, in the middle of our phone interview, asked me unprompted about the email I had sent to him. "Your email style is very professional," he said.
I confessed that ChatGPT had written the message to him requesting an interview.
"I was sort of like, 'This is going to be the most awkward conversation of my life,"' he said.
This confirmed a fear I'd been developing that my sources had started to think I was a jerk. One source, for example, had written me an effusive email thanking me for an article I'd written and inviting me to visit his office when I was next in Los Angeles.
ChatGPT's response was muted, verging on rude: "I appreciate your willingness to collaborate."
I was feeling mournful of my past exclamation-point studded internet existence. I know people think exclamation points are tacky. The writer Elmore Leonard advised measuring out "two or three per 100,000 words of prose." Respectfully, I disagree. I often use two or three per two or three words of prose. I'm an apologist for digital enthusiasm. ChatGPT, it turns out, is more reserved.
For all the irritation I developed toward my robot overlord, I found that some of my colleagues were impressed by my newly polished digital persona, including my teammate Jordyn, who consulted me on Wednesday for advice on an article pitch.
"I have a story idea I'd love to chat with you about," Jordyn wrote to me. "It's not urgent!!"
"I'm always up for a good story, urgent or not!" my robot replied. "Especially if it's a juicy one with plot twists and unexpected turns."
After a few minutes of back-and-forth, I was desperate to talk with Jordyn in person. I was losing patience with the bot's cloying tone. I missed my own stupid jokes, and (comparatively) normal voice.
More alarmingly, ChatGPT is prone to hallucinating -- meaning putting words and ideas together that don't actually make sense. While writing a note to a source about the timing for an interview, my bot randomly suggested asking him whether we should coordinate our outfits in advance so that our auras and chakras wouldn't clash.
I asked ChatGPT to draft a message to another colleague, who knew about my experiment, telling him I was in hell. "I'm sorry, but I cannot generate inappropriate or harmful content," the robot replied. I asked it to draft a message explaining that I was losing my mind. ChatGPT couldn't do that either.
Of course, many of the A.I. experts I consulted were undeterred by the notion of shedding their personalized communication style. "Truthfully, we copy and paste a lot already," said Michael Chui, a McKinsey partner and expert in generative A.I.
Mr. Chui conceded that some people see signs of dystopia in a future where workers communicate mostly through robots. He argued, though, that this wouldn't look all that unlike corporate exchanges that are already formulaic. "I recently had a colleague send me a text message saying, 'Hey was that last email you sent legit?"' Mr. Chui recalled.
It turned out that the email had been so stiff that the colleague thought it was written through ChatGPT. Mr. Chui's situation is a bit particular, though. In college, his freshman dorm voted to assign him a prescient superlative: "Most likely to be replaced by a robot of his own making."
I decided to end the week by asking the deputy editor of my department what role he saw for A.I. in the newsroom's future. "Do you think there's a possibility that we could see AI-generated content on the front page one day?" I wrote over Slack. "Or do you think that there are some things that are just better left to human writers?"
"Well, that doesn't sound like your voice!" the editor replied.
A day later, my experiment complete, I typed back my own response: "That's a relief!!!"

Staff Shortage At U.S. Prisons Reaches Crisis: [National Desk]

Full text: The patchwork system that has evolved to address the situation has drained morale among staff members and placed additional strains on prisoners.
From the outside, the prison complex in Florence, Colo., is a forbidding citadel of steel, concrete and coiled barbed wire, housing some of the most notorious inmates in federal custody. To hundreds of its employees, it is a stressful, isolated, short-staffed workplace.
Like many other federal prisons, Florence is undergoing a staffing crisis, with head counts on some guard shifts so low that teachers, case managers, counselors, facilities workers and even secretaries at the complex have been enlisted to serve as corrections officers, despite having only basic security training.
"If I don't show up, if I'm sick, or if I'm in training, or if I'm on vacation, they will force someone to take my shift," said John Butkovich, a corrections officer and union representative at Florence, which includes the country's most secure supermax unit and three less restrictive facilities. "It creates a safety issue: If you aren't savvy with the housing unit, or the position you're working, you are not going to spot a problem before it starts. This isn't the way it was meant to be."
Federal, state and local law enforcement agencies around the country, especially corrections departments, are struggling to hire and retain employees at all levels, as higher-paying, less demanding jobs draw away people facing rising housing, food and transportation costs. Nowhere has that been more of a problem than at the chronically troubled Bureau of Prisons, with about 160,000 inmates at 122 prisons and camps -- employing a work force of about 34,000 people who often earn less than state and county corrections workers.
That has put enormous strains on the system. Union officials contend that some recent incidents of inmate-on-inmate violence might have been prevented with greater staffing levels. The depleted work force, they say, has played in attacks on staff members, including in 2021, when a guard at a Florida prison responsible for monitoring more than 100 prisoners was assaulted with a metal shank.
It is also a self-perpetuating crisis. Taxing work conditions sap morale, prompting an exodus of experienced corrections officers, which, in turn, forces supervisors to lean harder on the employees left. Inmates suffer, too. They are often forced to wait longer for basic services, like laundry and maintenance, and the diversion of educational staffing can delay early releases.
"It's so depressing," said Aaron McGlothin, a warehouse worker and union representative at Mendota federal prison near Fresno, Calif. "We are always so far behind the curve."
The prison population in federal facilities has been dropping since 2015, a trend accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic and federal sentencing changes. But those numbers obscure the corrections officers who form the backbone of the system departing for neighboring local law enforcement agencies or sliding over to better positions at other federal agencies.
About 21 percent of the 20,446 positions for corrections officers funded by Congress -- 4,293 guards -- remain unfilled as of September, according to a report in March by the Justice Department's inspector general's office.
Colette S. Peters, who took over as the director of the Bureau of Prisons in August, said in an interview that filling those vacancies "is our No. 1 priority," even as she tackles a host of other issues, including the sexual abuse of female prisoners and staff members, the overuse of solitary confinement and an increase in suicides.
"Our hiring problems were compounded by the pandemic where we lost people who were faced with this disease day in and day out," she said in a conference room at the bureau's headquarters near the Capitol. "And, as we all know, the economy has shifted. In some rural areas, we have more or less saturated the employment market, and in urban areas, we're competing against employers who can offer a lot more money."
Ms. Peters, who oversaw Oregon's state prison system before moving to run the federal system, has outlined a series of initiatives intended to bolster the work force, including offering a one-time signing bonus of 25 percent for each new corrections officer.
The bonuses have yielded modest gains, she said, with job applications rising drastically at the start of the year. But they have done little to address the underlying issue of compensation in a system that offers starting salaries under $ 40,000 in some areas, officials and employees said.
Raising wages would require a major increase in the budget of a bureau, an often neglected division of the Justice Department. That is not likely to happen. Funding has remained relatively flat over the past several years, and the Biden administration is seeking only a tiny increase in the prison bureau budget next year -- 2.9 percent, well below the annual inflation rate of around 5 percent.
Until recently, prison officials have sought to play down the extent of the crisis, according to employees and union officials. But almost every facility in the country has had to take extreme measures to cover the gaps, by redeploying workers, in what is known as "augmentation," or by forcing guards to take mandatory overtime shifts.
In late March, Dave Demas, a corrections officer at Canaan, a Bureau of Prisons facility in northeastern Pennsylvania, had just finished a shift when a supervisor informed him that he had to cover an additional one because a co-worker could not come in.
"You're hit," the man told him. "You have to stay another eight hours."
While the inmate population at Canaan has remained relatively stable, the number of guards has decreased. In 2016, the prison, which has high- and minimum-security sections, had a fixed staffing level of 262 corrections officers. On any given day, that number is now closer to 210, Mr. Demas said, and accounting for those on military, paternity, personal or disciplinary leave, it is closer to 200.
"A lot of people are leaving," he added. "They used to want to stay in correctional services. It was a good, stable job -- but now they are looking for any avenue to get out."
Canaan is no ordinary prison. In 2013, an inmate fatally stabbed a guard, Eric Williams, 34, during a 10-minute attack that left him with 200 wounds.
The killing prompted a reappraisal of staffing, and it was top of mind to Representative Matt Cartwright, Democrat of Pennsylvania, when he successfully pushed Congress for an emergency appropriation of $ 180 million late last year to provide additional hiring incentives at federal prisons.
That money is nearly exhausted, and Mr. Cartwright said the White House budget request "isn't enough" to relieve the stress.
"It's hard to hire people these days," he said. "It's especially hard when you're running prisons."
The patchwork system that has evolved to address the situation has far-ranging consequences.
In one California prison, the laundry room had to be shut down for a day while the supervisor in charge was sent to guard a cellblock, leaving prisoners to stew in dirty clothes, one staff member said. In another part of the same complex, warehouse workers were forced to leave their posts, stalling the delivery of critical supplies, including toilet paper.
There have been sporadic reports of increased violence at some facilities where employees who were not full-time guards were pressed into service.
But perhaps most concerning of all is the use of educational and vocational aides for other jailhouse duties. Their absence can delay or disrupt prisoners' access to skills needed on the outside, and complicate their efforts to accrue points required under the 2018 First Step Act, which was intended to speed up the release of inmates deemed to be of limited risk, said Kevin Ring, the president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, a prisoners' rights group in Washington.
Florence, one of the best-known prisons in the country, houses some of the most notorious inmates in the federal system, including one of the Boston Marathon bombers and Zacarias Moussaoui, who was implicated in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Its staff must cope not only with the pressures of ensuring safety, but also with more workaday issues: The prison is in a fast-growing part of Colorado, equidistant between Pueblo and Colorado Springs, with rising home prices and the transportation costs associated with long-distance commuting.
The bureau offers salary enhancements, typically 10 percent, each year in places like Florence that have difficulty retaining and recruiting corrections officers because they are isolated or have high costs of living. Last July, officials in Washington, concerned by low staffing levels, raised the payout to the maximum allowed -- 25 percent.
That has helped a bit, but the facility is still short-staffed, with 30 to 40 vacancies on any given day, according to an estimate by Local 1169 of the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents officers and other prison workers, including at Florence.
Employees who are not full-time corrections officers have become a permanent and essential stopgap at the prison, being called in as replacements more than 2,200 times last year, according to government records obtained by the union.
To address this reality, Colorado's two senators, Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, both Democrats, are requesting that the Bureau of Prisons raise their annual bonuses to 25 percent from 10 percent, in line with the incentives offered to full-fledged corrections officers.
"This understaffing has placed employees and the inmate population in an unsustainable environment and created a reliance on mandatory overtime and reassignment of noncustody staff," they wrote last December in a letter to Ms. Peters's predecessor. "Fatigue, exhaustion and low morale have reduced staff productivity and led to more sick leave, retirements and resignations."
The bureau has not yet responded to the request.

From the outside, the prison complex in Florence, Colorado, is a forbidding citadel of steel, concrete and coiled barbed wire, housing some of the most notorious inmates in federal custody. To hundreds of its employees, it is a stressful, isolated, short-staffed workplace.
Like many other federal prisons, Florence is experiencing a staffing crisis, with head counts on some guard shifts so low that teachers, case managers, counselors, facilities workers and even secretaries at the complex have been enlisted to serve as corrections officers, despite having only basic security training.
“If I don’t show up, if I’m sick, or if I’m in training, or if I’m on vacation, they will force someone to take my shift,” said John Butkovich, a corrections officer and union representative at Florence, which includes the country’s most secure supermax unit and three less restrictive facilities. “It creates a safety issue: If you aren’t savvy with the housing unit, or the position you’re working, you are not going to spot a problem before it starts. This isn’t the way it was meant to be.”
Federal, state and local law enforcement agencies around the country, especially corrections departments, are struggling to hire and retain employees at all levels, as higher-paying, less demanding jobs draw away people facing rising housing, food and transportation costs. Nowhere has that been more of a problem than at the chronically troubled Bureau of Prisons, with about 160,000 inmates at 122 prisons and camps — employing a workforce of about 34,000 people who often earn less than state and county corrections workers.
That has put enormous strains on the system. Union officials contend that some recent incidents of inmate-on-inmate violence might have been prevented with greater staffing levels. The depleted workforce, they say, has played in attacks on staff members, including in 2021, when a guard at a Florida prison responsible for monitoring more than 100 prisoners was assaulted with a metal shank.
It is also a self-perpetuating crisis. Taxing work conditions sap morale, prompting an exodus of experienced corrections officers, which, in turn, forces supervisors to lean harder on the employees left. Inmates suffer, too. They are often forced to wait longer for basic services, such as laundry and maintenance, and the diversion of educational staffing can delay early releases.
“It’s so depressing,” said Aaron McGlothin, a warehouse worker and union representative at Mendota federal prison near Fresno, California. “We are always so far behind the curve.”
The prison population in federal facilities has been dropping since 2015, a trend accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic and federal sentencing changes. But those numbers obscure the corrections officers who form the backbone of the system departing for neighboring local law enforcement agencies or sliding over to better positions at other federal agencies.
About 21% of the 20,446 positions for corrections officers funded by Congress — 4,293 guards — remain unfilled as of September, according to a report in March by the Justice Department’s inspector general’s office.
Colette S. Peters, who took over as the director of the Bureau of Prisons in August, said in an interview that filling those vacancies “is our No. 1 priority,” even as she tackles a host of other issues, including the sexual abuse of female prisoners and staff members, the overuse of solitary confinement and an increase in suicides.
“Our hiring problems were compounded by the pandemic where we lost people who were faced with this disease day in and day out,” she said in a conference room at the bureau’s headquarters near the Capitol. “And, as we all know, the economy has shifted. In some rural areas, we have more or less saturated the employment market, and in urban areas, we’re competing against employers who can offer a lot more money.”
Peters, who oversaw Oregon’s state prison system before moving to run the federal system, has outlined a series of initiatives intended to bolster the workforce, including offering a one-time signing bonus of 25% for each new corrections officer.
The bonuses have yielded modest gains, she said, with job applications rising significantly at the start of the year. But they have done little to address the underlying issue of compensation in a system that offers starting salaries under $40,000 in some areas, officials and employees said.
Raising wages would require a major increase in the budget of a bureau, an often neglected division of the Justice Department. That is not likely to happen. Funding has remained relatively flat over the past several years, and the Biden administration is seeking only a tiny increase in the prison bureau budget next year — 2.9%, well below the annual inflation rate of around 5%.
Until recently, prison officials have sought to play down the extent of the crisis, according to employees and union officials. But almost every facility in the country has had to take extreme measures to cover the gaps, by redeploying workers, in what is known as “augmentation,” or by forcing guards to take mandatory overtime shifts.
In late March, Dave Demas, a corrections officer at Canaan, a Bureau of Prisons facility in northeastern Pennsylvania, had just finished a shift when a supervisor informed him that he had to cover an additional one because a co-worker could not come in.
“You’re hit,” the man told him. “You have to stay another eight hours.”
While the inmate population at Canaan has remained relatively stable, the number of guards has decreased. In 2016, the prison, which has high- and minimum-security sections, had a fixed staffing level of 262 corrections officers. On any given day, that number is now closer to 210, Demas said, and accounting for those on military, paternity, personal or disciplinary leave, it is closer to 200.
“A lot of people are leaving,” he added. “They used to want to stay in correctional services. It was a good, stable job — but now they are looking for any avenue to get out.”
Canaan is no ordinary prison. In 2013, an inmate fatally stabbed a guard, Eric Williams, 34, during a 10-minute attack that left him with 200 wounds.
The killing prompted a reappraisal of staffing, and it was top of mind to Rep. Matt Cartwright, D-Pa., when he successfully pushed Congress for an emergency appropriation of $180 million late last year to provide additional hiring incentives at federal prisons.
That money is nearly exhausted, and Cartwright said the White House budget request “isn’t enough” to relieve the stress.
“It’s hard to hire people these days,” he said. “It’s especially hard when you’re running prisons.”
The patchwork system that has evolved to address the situation has far-ranging consequences.
In one California prison, the laundry room had to be shut down for a day while the supervisor in charge was sent to guard a cellblock, leaving prisoners to stew in dirty clothes, one staff member said. In another part of the same complex, warehouse workers were forced to leave their posts, stalling the delivery of critical supplies, including toilet paper.
There have been sporadic reports of increased violence at some facilities where employees who were not full-time guards were pressed into service.
But perhaps most concerning of all is the use of educational and vocational aides for other jailhouse duties. Their absence can delay or disrupt prisoners’ access to skills needed on the outside, and complicate their efforts to accrue points required under the 2018 First Step Act, which was intended to speed up the release of inmates deemed to be of limited risk, said Kevin Ring, president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, a prisoners’ rights group in Washington.
Florence, one of the best-known prisons in the country, houses some of the most notorious inmates in the federal system, including one of the Boston Marathon bombers and Zacarias Moussaoui, who was implicated in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Its staff must cope not only with the pressures of ensuring safety, but also with more workaday issues: The prison is in a fast-growing part of Colorado, equidistant between Pueblo and Colorado Springs, with rising home prices and the transportation costs associated with long-distance commuting.
The bureau offers salary enhancements, typically 10%, each year in places such as Florence that have difficulty retaining and recruiting corrections officers because they are isolated or have high costs of living. Last July, officials in Washington, concerned by low staffing levels, raised the payout to the maximum allowed — 25%.
That has helped a bit, but the facility is still short-staffed, with 30 to 40 vacancies on any given day, according to an estimate by Local 1169 of the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents officers and other prison workers, including at Florence.
Employees who are not full-time corrections officers have become a permanent and essential stopgap at the prison, being called in as replacements more than 2,200 times last year, according to government records obtained by the union.
To address this reality, Colorado’s two senators, Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, both Democrats, are requesting that the Bureau of Prisons raise their annual bonuses to 25% from 10%, in line with the incentives offered to full-fledged corrections officers.
“This understaffing has placed employees and the inmate population in an unsustainable environment and created a reliance on mandatory overtime and reassignment of noncustody staff,” they wrote last December in a letter to Peters’ predecessor. “Fatigue, exhaustion and low morale have reduced staff productivity and led to more sick leave, retirements and resignations.”
The bureau has not yet responded to the request.

This Time, Empathy For a Stalker: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: A somber, psychology-heavy series tries to take the "erotic thriller" out of the erotic thriller.
When is a rabbit an Easter egg? When it hops onscreen in "Fatal Attraction," the oddly tranquil new series inspired by the infamous, bunny-boiling 1987 film of the same title.
It's not a major spoiler to report that this little white cutie avoids the stockpot. Gentle homage to the tawdry, garishly effective original -- one of the primary reasons no one calls their productions "erotic thrillers" anymore -- is the rule. No one is drowned in a bathtub, but there is a joking reference to the inadvisability of having a tub in the house.
Nearly everything about this new "Fatal Attraction," whose eight-episode season premieres Sunday on Paramount+, has been toned down, often to the point of torpor. The only thing that retains the original's raciness is the new version of the echt-'80s title font -- the "Fatal" still looks like a signature scrawled on a bar tab between bumps of cocaine.
Major surgery was inevitable for source material that turned a single, sexually active woman into a horror-movie monster who threatened the sanctity of a suburban family. If that weren't sufficiently toxic by 2020s standards, the film also cleverly framed the woman's psychosis as feminism run amok, generating sympathy for the poor upper-middle-class, white male sap who stumbled into an affair with her.
So Alexandra Cunningham ("Dirty John," "Desperate Housewives") and Kevin J. Hynes ("Perry Mason"), working with the film's writer, James Dearden, have reimagined "Fatal Attraction" in myriad ways, none of which are erotic and few of which are thrilling. From the moment Dan Gallagher -- played by a disheveled, halting Joshua Jackson, subbing in for the sleek Michael Douglas of the film -- kicks off the series by shuffling into a parole hearing, the show feels as if it's shouldering a responsibility, weighed down by the need to apologize for Hollywood's past misconduct.
Dan is up for parole because in this new universe, he has served 15 years for the murder of his stalker, Alex Forrest (Lizzy Caplan). Responding not just to shifting mores but also to the demands of serial storytelling -- the show runs close to a full eight hours -- Cunningham and Hynes have turned "Fatal Attraction" into a murder mystery, as Dan, a former Los Angeles prosecutor, tries to figure out who really killed Alex while awkwardly reconciling with his ex-wife, Beth (Amanda Peet), and daughter, Ellen (Alyssa Jirrels).
The mystery plays out in leisurely L.A.-noir style, introducing clouds of suspects as the show jumps back and forth in time and stretches out its thin narrative by replaying entire episodes from different points of view. The temporal shifts also serve to educate both Dan and the audience about the noxious privilege and entitlement that precipitated his downfall. (This portion of the show benefits greatly from the presence of Toby Huss as Mike, Dan's best friend and a former cop who was collateral damage in Dan's debacle.)
But apparently converting "Fatal Attraction" into a reasonably diverting crime drama wasn't enough to remove the stain of the original. So the series also offers an elaborate psychodramatic narrative embellishment -- a sort of study guide -- expressed in frequent discussions of the work of Carl Jung and his collaborator Toni Wolff. Ellen, in the present, is a psychology student, and we also hear recitations of the fairy tales she delights in as a child. The allegorical, slightly metafictional notions are rammed home: a character who gives Ellen a book of tales is called "an actual fairy godmother"; a pet dog is named Ziggy, short for Sigmund.
Ellen's research leads her to reassess the behavior of her father's murdered nemesis, and the greatest labor this "Fatal Attraction" takes on is its effort to turn Alex into an understandable, even sympathetic, character. Dan is a chastened version of the narcissistic jerk Douglas played in the film, but the vivid hysteria of Glenn Close's Oscar-nominated performance as Alex is mostly replaced in Caplan's version by a jumpy vulnerability, and Alex now gets a back story to explain her sociopathic obsessiveness.
This virtue-signaling therapy noir manages, in its peculiarly studious way, to meld the racy '80s and the censorious '20s, and it's not exactly hard to watch. It is competently made and nice to look at, it has a knockoff version of a languorous Southern California vibe, and Caplan and Jackson are both engaging. (Jackson gets extra credit -- he has to compensate for hideous haircuts in both the past and present time lines.) They get good support from a large cast that includes Huss, Toks Olagundoye as one of Dan's former co-workers, Vivien Lyra Blair as the young Ellen and the scream queen Dee Wallace as the owner of the rabbit.
What's missing is the metabolism, the transgressive energy and -- at least in the context of its time -- the glossy sexiness that the director Adrian Lyne brought to the film. The thing you wonder as you watch the series isn't why they made the changes they did, but why they bothered making the show at all. Wasn't there other intellectual property in the Paramount vaults that would have made the jump more easily? (It worked for "Top Gun," after all.)
And what's noticeable is that despite all the modifications, Cunningham and Hynes didn't change the basic emotional and psychological architecture: The crucial moments are still Alex's bursts of antisocial behavior and Dan's violent reaction to them, and the story is still strung on those slasher-film tentpoles. (If you've seen the original, you'll know exactly when a particular pair of eyes is going to pop open, even though the moment is campy and completely out of character with the rest of the series.) They did their best to scrub the misogyny out of "Fatal Attraction," but at the end of the day it's still about the fear of a crazy lady.

Big Tech Blunts a Wall Street Decline: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Wall Street fell again Wednesday, though a rally for Microsoft and some other Big Tech stocks helped to limit the losses.
The S&P 500 dropped 0.4 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.7 percent, while the Nasdaq composite led the market with a gain of 0.5 percent.
Wall Street was coming off its worst day in a month, hurt by concerns about the strength of U.S. banks. The spotlight has been harshest on First Republic Bank, and the worry is that it and other smaller and mid-sized banks could suffer debilitating runs of deposits from customers, similar to the ones that caused last month's failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Even without more shutdowns, the industry's struggles could cause a pullback in lending by banks that saps the economy.
PacWest Bancorp., another bank that has been in investors' spotlight, rose 7.5 percent after reporting stronger results than expected and saying that its deposits have grown since late March. That may offer optimism that First Republic's struggles could be specific to itself, rather than a symptom of deeper issues with the system.
Also dropping sharply Wednesday was Enphase Energy, which fell 25.7 percent despite reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than forecast. But analysts said its revenue forecast for the current quarter fell short of some expectations.
Most companies have been topping expectations so far this reporting season, but the low bar set for them has many investors paying more attention to what chief executives say about upcoming trends than results for the past three months.
Activision Blizzard tumbled 11.4 percent after British regulators blocked its takeover by Microsoft on concerns it would hurt competition in the cloud gaming market.
While most stocks fell, gains for Microsoft and other Big Tech companies prevented a sharper slide for the market. Microsoft rose 7.2 percent after reporting stronger profit for the first three months of the year than analysts expected. It carries a huge weight on the S&P 500 because it's the second-largest stock in the index.
Tech stocks have been some of the year's best performers as ttech companies lay off workers and make other cost cuts to improve their profitability. Hopes for a coming pause from the Federal Reserve on its barrage of interest rate hikes have also helped them.
Google's parent company, Alphabet, turned a bigger profit than expected. But its stock slipped 0.2 percent after drifting between gains and losses through the day. It reported its first back-to-back drops in advertising revenue from a year earlier since it became a publicly traded company in 2004.
More Big Tech firms are set to follow with their own reports soon. Facebook's parent company, Meta Platforms, rose 0.9 percent ahead of its report. It jumped in after-hours trading after it said it earned more than expected.
Chipotle Mexican Grill rose 12.9 percent for the biggest gain in the S&P 500 after reporting stronger profit than expected, raising hopes that consumer spending could remain resilient despite a slowing economy. That's key because consumer spending makes up the bulk of the U.S. economy.
Stocks have been mostly listless in recent weeks as Wall Street struggles with several questions. With few answers imminent, Mark Haefele, UBS Global Wealth Management's chief investment officer, expects stocks to stay stuck in a range.
Not only are investors worried about the possibility of a recession this year, he said stocks also look relatively expensive. That means "the scope for upside appears limited, in our view," he said.
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and other loans, rose to 3.43 percent. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, fell to 3.92 percent.

Four Specials Punch Above Their Weight: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Jaye McBride, Mike Vecchione and Kyle Kinane focus on punch lines and delivery. Mae Martin creates a vibe that works in a different key.
Jaye McBride, 'Daddy's Girl'
YouTube
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Setups and punch lines get all the attention, but the stuff in between can be just as important, especially in short jokes where every word counts. Take this one by Jaye McBride: "I love old guys. The older the better." Pause. "I don't do online dating. I do carbon dating." This could work without the second sentence -- "The older the better" -- but not as well. The reasons have as much to do with rhythm as meaning. It's the kind of small touch that lets you know McBride, a bespectacled Comedy Cellar regular, has an ear for jokes.
Her debut special, an offhanded if very funny production shot at Union Hall in Brooklyn, has a quick and jaunty style, a rough production for a stand-up act without frills. She is the first to tell you that her brand of stand-up leans more on punch lines than stories, but this doesn't mean the hour doesn't vary, showing off different genres of jokes. There's the windy kind that abruptly shifts because of a twist that upends everything that came before. There's the observational material: A transgender comic, McBride has one bit about etiquette that, no matter how sure you are, you can never ask someone if they're trans. There are self-deprecating asides, some spiky transgressive stuff and satirical jokes designed to make a point. After telling us she transitioned 15 years ago, McBride quiets the crowd: "Don't clap. I only did it to compete in the Olympics."
Mike Vecchione, 'The Attractives'
YouTube
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Onstage, Mike Vecchione speaks in a hypnotically steady cadence, adopting an almost uncanny calm. Sometimes, this deadpan affect, slightly slower than normal speech, is used to play dumb. (He has a great bit about being praised for his emotional intelligence, which he claims is invented by smart people to make the dumb feel better.) At other times, the result is ludicrously arrogant, as when he confides that the pandemic was difficult for good-looking people like himself because of the masks. ("As attractives, we're used to being treated a certain way.")
His jokes can be deceptively intricate, and while many comics lean on callbacks as a cheap trick, he finds clever ways to incorporate them. As with other stand-ups, Dave Attell's influential delivery haunts his set. You hear its notes especially in the wry way Vecchione introduces jokes. ("Fine, guys, what's my immigration policy? Is that what you want to know?") But at his best, he finds a space between sarcasm and sincerity. Take his explanation that one of his passions is going to other cities and insulting their pizza. What New Yorker can't relate? Or the spin on a familiar line flattering the audience: "You're a great crowd because you're getting my jokes."
Kyle Kinane, 'Shocks and Struts'
YouTube
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
When you first see Kyle Kinane, the gravel-voiced comic road warrior, he's all by himself outside his van under a vast sky. This is not a flashy stand-up. He doesn't play with form, have a message or belong to a specific school of comedy. His jokes don't rely much on character work and they don't tend to wade into big issues. But this solitary image fits him. Kinane finds humor in feeling out of place, reliably turning crusty irritation into eccentric flights of fancy. On his latest special, he grouses about nonchalant surgeons, circumcision and attractive people in playful language filled with turns of phrase that will make you smile or even cringe (he calls foreskin "the devil's calamari"). But what encapsulates him at his best is a lament on jam bands. It's a niche bit that leans on giddy contempt and detailed performance culminating in an act-out emphasizing the unlikely pathos of the guy in the band who desperately wants to end the song but can't pull it off. It's a hilarious tragedy.
Mae Martin, 'SAP'
Netflix
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In their new Netflix special, the nonbinary comic Mae Martin (star of the series "Feel Good") patiently, and with considered cheerfulness, explains the difference between gender and sexuality while rebutting comics like Dave Chappelle and placing gender fluidity in historical context. But also, Martin says that if people are confused about the contemporary conversation about gender, that's OK, too. "I do not understand Wi-Fi but I know that it's real." Martin says. "I don't let it keep me up at night."
Martin, 35, discusses gender grudgingly, and their bit imagining Chappelle and Ricky Gervais, who also have Netflix specials, seeing "SAP" and changing their mind about their trans material has received headlines. But there's also something awkward about this more straightforwardly sincere section of the special, an abrupt shift from what precedes and follows it. A sweetly charismatic performer, their intimate comic voice is skewed and sunny, mystical but somehow grounded. Martin hails from Canada, where they shot this special, on a set dressed like a forest, and the sideways anecdotal humor (at the end of one story, Martin points out there are no punch lines, it's just a vignette) belongs to a rich legacy of oddball Canadian comedy. (A moose plays a significant role in a joke.)
Pay close attention and you can see a sturdy introduction to an entire life here, from a cringe comedy story about conception to a horrified portrait of puberty to a romance-besotted 20s to the current jaded moment. Sighing over having to talk about potential baby names in yet another relationship, Martin says: "Let me wade through the graveyard of dead hypothetical kids."
The first half of the special is strong, filled with surprising bursts of dark poetry and strange characters, like a postman in Europe who buries the mail of an entire town. Martin loves this man, whose explanation is as offhanded and blunt as the comedian is. There are ideas that emerge throughout the special about identities, the ways we intensely curate them as children and stop as adults. A better show would find more connective tissue and a funnier one would tighten up some stories, cut one or two and add a few punch lines. But doing that might also make Martin seem more like everyone else. It's already an amusing, effortless vibe here, one whose pleasures derive in part from being comfortable to be what it is.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: These heirloom cucumber varieties, some of which date to ancient Egypt, 'are never bitter, and always easy on the digestion.'
Jay Tracy was just trying to solve a problem: He wanted to identify which cucumber varieties might perform best in hot, dry Tucson, Ariz., where he lived in 2009.
Traditional cucumbers didn't like it much there, especially in summer. And while he'd had better luck with the basic long, straight Armenian type, he wasn't crazy about its texture. What else should he try?
Answering that question has taken him time-traveling through botanical and cultural history dating as far back as ancient Egypt -- and has turned Mr. Tracy into a devoted foster parent to more than 50 cucumber varieties and counting.
Many of them bear little resemblance in shape or flavor to the generic supermarket model (Cucumis sativus), with its thick, waxy skin. Mr. Tracy has found himself deep in the world of cucumber melons: varieties of muskmelon (Cucumis melo) that are bred to be harvested and eaten immature, and are genetically closer to a cantaloupe or honeydew than a cucumber.
Think of them this way: "It's a melon grown like a zucchini -- meant to be picked at a young stage and eaten like a cucumber," Mr. Tracy said. "They are melons botanically, and cucumbers agriculturally."
It turns out that "cucumber" doesn't cover the range of eccentricities expressed among everything labeled with that name any more than the word "tomato" conjures up the image of every single tomato, as if they were all uniform red globes.
Some cucumber melons in Mr. Tracy's collection -- offered alongside choice C. sativus types in his online Cucumber Shop since 2019 -- are long and twisted like snakes. Others are oval, or fat little globes like Carosello Tondo Massafra, which has firm flesh and few seeds. Many fall somewhere in between -- like the nearly white Palestinian Fakous, with its fine-textured flesh inside six- or seven-inch fruits.
The cucumber melons' thinner skin -- no peeling required -- may be smooth, ridged or fuzzy, covered in the finest hairs, and dark or pale green, approaching white. (One, the white-fruited Pupuneddhra Bianca, may surprise growers by occasionally producing dark green fruits on some vines.)
A highlight of the diversity of cucumber melons in his care: "They are never bitter, and always easy on the digestion."
Making Cucumber Connections
Mr. Tracy, 44, an itinerant teacher of the deaf for his county office of education, now lives less than an hour north of San Francisco, in Fairfield, Calif., with his wife and four teenagers -- and an extra refrigerator loaded with pounds of heirloom cucumber seed. Much of it is not from variations on the common cucumber, but from those cucumber melons.
This seed stash represents the progeny of a treasure hunt that has seen Mr. Tracy forge international friendships online, particularly in the Apulian region of southeastern Italy. He has made domestic connections, too, with adventurous American seed-keepers like Culinary Breeding Network and Experimental Farm Network, and has read countless obscure research papers on the Cucurbitaceae, as well as textbooks on growing and saving seed.
He has also waded into the U.S. Department of Agriculture's gene bank of agricultural crops to request seed. A recent find there: the exceptionally drought-tolerant Ayra cucumber indigenous to Rajasthan, India, which has the strange distinction of producing pinkish sap that dries red. Who could resist?
Along the way, he has found cucumbers that will stand up to a range of garden conditions. And he has found himself on a campaign, as he put it: "To help people discover cucumbers that have been here all along."
Simplifying the Taxonomic Tangle
The earliest examples of C. sativus in literature or drawings that he has learned about, Mr. Tracy said, are from about 1300, after the species made its way to Europe along a trade route from India. Any cucumber references before that are probably to C. melo, which likely traces its history back to Egypt. That means that "in biblical texts, we're talking about cucumber melons," he said.
Like a rambunctious cucumber vine, the cucumber melons -- not to be confused with the trending Mexican sour gherkins or cucamelons (Melothria scabra), a New World Cucurbit -- are a bit of a taxonomic tangle.
A gardener could simply slice them this way: There are the long ones, like the Armenian cucumber and its closest kin, that "a lot of the world would call snake melons," Mr. Tracy said. Those are in the flexuosus group (C. melo var. flexuosus), and generally grow on plants with a vining habit, like Light Armenian, a very early producer with slightly grooved skin.
The shorter ones, cultivated mostly in southern Italy over many centuries, are C. melo var. chate, usually just called Carosello, and tend to be mostly bush forms. The story goes that the name, meaning carousel, was bestowed by a seed company wanting an easier-to-pronounce version of the local dialect for Carosino, the small town credited with first cultivating them.
Mr. Tracy's most popular cucumber is Striped Carosello Leccese, which has skin marked in mottled, darkish bands. Its four- to six-inch fruits have a crisp but tender texture, and a slightly sweet aftertaste.
What's important: All cucumber melons crave heat, right from the start. To get a jump on things, Mr. Tracy sprouts the seed in a moist, folded paper towel inside a plastic bag, at a temperature of about 80 degrees. Once the seed sprouts, he transplants each seedling into a soil block or cell of seed-starting mix in his greenhouse -- or outside, in the ground, if the weather has thoroughly warmed.
At the other end of the season, unless you're growing for seed, he recommends picking early for best eating -- and being guided by fruit diameter rather than length. The cylindrical fruits, like many of the Carosello and also the snake melons, are best at about one and a half to two inches across. With the round Carosellos, three to four inches is ideal.
"You can let it go a little longer," he said, "but the quality is better at that state."
It Takes a Village
Tracking down, growing and selling historic cucumbers isn't a get-rich-quick scheme, nor is it a backyard project, exactly. It's more of an act of faith and passion. (And lest this seem an unusual hobby, Mr. Tracy's two earlier, serious ones -- raising reptiles and then praying mantises -- win hands down.)
"It is all a labor of love," he said. "Love for the people who have since passed on, and an appreciation for all they went through to develop each individual variety; love for each variety I steward; and most of all, a love for those who continue to carry on the legacy of these cucumbers and shared them."
Only a portion of his 10-by-20-foot backyard vegetable garden is sunny enough to suit the task. And anyway, cucumbers are promiscuous sorts, inclined to cross-pollinate (usually assisted by bees) if planted near another variety of the same species, muddying the genetics.
"Whether the varieties produce short or long fruits," Mr. Tracy said, "if you were to grow them side by side, they would cross."
Isolation is essential to yield seed that is true to type, and that's his goal: to track down, stabilize and distribute authentic versions of these living pieces of history.
Each variety that he wants to grow for a fresh crop of seed -- about a dozen each year -- therefore needs its own space. That has been possible only thanks to friends who make room in their own gardens and through small contracts with nearby farmers.
As each crop gradually produces fruit, Mr. Tracy begins the process of selection, to identify which plants express the unique traits that have characterized that variety through its history -- a process that can take multiple generations. He puts a fruit from each plant to the taste test to evaluate its eating quality and notes other desired traits, pulling plants that don't make the cut (or those that display signs of disease) and leaving the best to mature.
Saving Seed: Adventures in the Man Cave
The Cucumber Shop company headquarters is in what Mr. Tracy's wife, Melanie, calls the man cave -- a dry bar off the family room where he packs orders, stockpiles fruit for seed and then processes it.
To harvest cucumber melon seed, the fruits must be left to grow on the vine way past the eating stage, "so that they look like a melon," he said.
He brings the fruit inside to a cool, dry place to let it sit "until it starts to smell really fruity," he said. Each one is slit open lengthwise to get at the seeds, which are washed in a colander to rinse out the pulp, and then dried thoroughly and refrigerated.
While Mr. Tracy is still a fairly young man, he is already thinking ahead. As part of insuring a stable future for these cherished varieties, some seed will go to other catalogs, and from there into the farms and gardens of their customers. Uprising Seeds in Washington State, with a special interest in traditional Italian varieties, is stewarding Light Green Carosello Leccese. Hoss Tools, in Georgia, and San Diego Seed Company, in California, both list some.
Once their customers try a cucumber melon, Mr. Tracy is confident that they'll return for more, the way local market farmers who grow his unusual varieties have done.
"Their customers see it and say, 'Oooh, that's different,' and try it," he said. "And then they don't want the other cucumbers any longer."

U.N. Inspector Warns Both Sides Are Massing Near Nuclear Plant: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Amid signs of offensives and counteroffensives, concern is rekindling about what it will mean for the biggest nuclear plant in Europe.
KYIV, Ukraine -- Russia and Ukraine are ramping up their military forces in southern Ukraine amid signs that the fighting may soon escalate, a United Nations official said on Wednesday after crossing a front line held by the Ukrainian military to inspect a nuclear power plant seized by Moscow.
"It is obvious that military activity is increasing in this whole region, so every possible measure and precaution should be taken so that the plant is not attacked and can be protected," said the official, Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Just hours before Mr. Grossi spoke, a new round of explosions shook Melitopol, a Russian-occupied city in the same region as the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Some Ukrainian officials have said the city is a likely target in a counteroffensive mounted by Kyiv to reclaim land lost to Moscow after Russia invaded 13 months ago.
As concerns rose about a flare-up of combat around the plant, fighting raged on Wednesday to the northeast, in the city of Bakhmut. There appears to be little left of the city to save, and given its minimal strategic value and the heavy losses already sustained by Ukrainian forces, some analysts have questioned the wisdom of staying there.
But Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said this week that its military forces had no choice but to continue the fight for Bakhmut. A Ukrainian loss in the monthslong battle, he said, would strengthen the hand of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.
"If he will feel some blood -- smell that we are weak -- he will push, push, push," Mr. Zelensky said in an interview with The Associated Press.
Mr. Zelensky, who visited troops near Bakhmut last week, also said that withdrawing from the city would invite domestic and international calls for unacceptable territorial compromises from Kyiv to bring the war to an end, and might sap the morale of Ukrainians.
"Our society will feel tired," Mr. Zelensky said. "Our society will push me to have compromise with them."
Russian forces in Zaporizhzhia seized the nuclear plant -- the largest in Europe -- more than a year ago and have used artillery stationed there to launch attacks on nearby towns.
For months, Mr. Grossi, the U.N. nuclear official, has warned that shelling around the plant -- some of which has hit critical equipment -- was unprecedented in the history of civilian nuclear power and could lead to a catastrophic nuclear accident.
At a news conference during his visit to the plant on Wednesday, he voiced fresh concerns.
"There is open talk about offensives and counteroffensives," Mr. Grossi said.
Hoping to maintain an element of surprise, Ukraine's military leaders have shrouded in secrecy the location of what is widely expected to be a spring counteroffensive. Apart from Melitopol, the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine is also viewed as a possible avenue of attack.
But Melitopol presents an especially inviting target. Recapturing it would build on the successes of Ukrainian forces late last year, when they retook Russian-occupied areas in two nearby regions: Kharkiv and Kherson.
If Ukraine's forces can add Melitopol, it will move them much closer to reversing a major Russian military achievement last year, when Russia seized enough coastal territory to create a so-called land bridge that connects Russia to Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula it illegally annexed in 2014.
The blasts in Melitopol reported on Wednesday occurred around 5:30 a.m., Vladimir Rogov, a pro-Russian occupation official, said on the Telegram messaging app. A train depot was damaged as well as parts of the power grid, he said, adding that there were no casualties.
The exiled Ukrainian mayor of the city, Ivan Fedorov, also said that several loud explosions had been heard across the city before dawn and that smoke was rising from near a train depot.
The Ukrainian government did not immediately comment, but for months Melitopol has been subject to attacks by partisans, as well as missile strikes launched from Ukrainian lines dozens of miles away. And a Ukrainian lawmaker, Mykyta Poturaev, said on Wednesday that attacks in Melitopol formed "part of a preparation operation" before a counteroffensive.
Such declarations could, however, be part of a disinformation campaign. Last year, Ukrainian officials telegraphed their intention to attack the southern city of Kherson only to launch a full-scale counteroffensive in the northeast, around Kharkiv. It was only months later that they drove the Russian forces out of Kherson.
With neither side showing signs of moving any closer to the negotiating table, some of Ukraine's allies appeared resigned to a prolonged conflict.
In Germany, a parliamentary panel passed a spending bill on Wednesday that includes 8 billion euros -- about $ 8.6 billion -- in military aid to Ukraine to be spent over the next decade for weapons, munitions and supplies to help it defend itself against Russia.
Boris Pistorius, Germany's defense minister, called the aid package "a very, very important step to show how serious we are about our long-term commitment to Ukraine in their fight against Putin."
On Monday, the government delivered 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks that the Ukrainian government had long campaigned for.
Russia has also been working to shore up its alliances.
On Wednesday, a senior security adviser to Mr. Putin met with India's prime minister in Delhi to discuss their nations' "mutual interests," officials said, as Moscow continued its campaign to build stronger alliances with trading partners outside the bloc of Western countries helping Ukraine resist Russia's invasion.
The adviser, Nikolai Patrushev, "discussed matters of bilateral cooperation" with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, according to a statement from Russia's Security Council. Mr. Patrushev, the council's secretary, was in India for a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which includes India and China.
Neither side gave details of the talks, but they came at a time when Moscow is seeking to drive a wedge between the West and two countries in particular, India and China, which have remained neutral on its decision to seize territory in Ukraine.

Human Power to Process Cues May Be Next Frontier for Bots: [National Desk]

Full text: Some researchers claim that chatbots have developed theory of mind. But is that just our own theory of mind gone wild?
Mind reading is common among us humans. Not in the ways that psychics claim to do it, by gaining access to the warm streams of consciousness that fill every individual's experience, or in the ways that mentalists claim to do it, by pulling a thought out of your head at will. Everyday mind reading is more subtle: We take in people's faces and movements, listen to their words and then decide or intuit what might be going on in their heads.
Among psychologists, such intuitive psychology -- the ability to attribute to other people mental states different from our own -- is called theory of mind, and its absence or impairment has been linked to autism, schizophrenia and other developmental disorders. Theory of mind helps us communicate with and understand one another; it allows us to enjoy literature and movies, play games and make sense of our social surroundings. In many ways, the capacity is an essential part of being human.
What if a machine could read minds, too?
Recently, Michal Kosinski, a psychologist at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, made just that argument: that large language models like OpenAI's ChatGPT and GPT-4 -- next-word prediction machines trained on vast amounts of text from the internet -- have developed theory of mind. His studies have not been peer reviewed, but they prompted scrutiny and conversation among cognitive scientists, who have been trying to take the often asked question these days -- Can ChatGPT do this? -- and move it into the realm of more robust scientific inquiry. What capacities do these models have, and how might they change our understanding of our own minds?
"Psychologists wouldn't accept any claim about the capacities of young children just based on anecdotes about your interactions with them, which is what seems to be happening with ChatGPT," said Alison Gopnik, a psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley and one of the first researchers to look into theory of mind in the 1980s. "You have to do quite careful and rigorous tests."
Dr. Kosinski's previous research showed that neural networks trained to analyze facial features like nose shape, head angle and emotional expression could predict people's political views and sexual orientation with a startling degree of accuracy (about 72 percent in the first case and about 80 percent in the second case). His recent work on large language models uses classic theory of mind tests that measure the ability of children to attribute false beliefs to other people.
A famous example is the Sally-Anne test, in which a girl, Anne, moves a marble from a basket to a box when another girl, Sally, isn't looking. To know where Sally will look for the marble, researchers claimed, a viewer would have to exercise theory of mind, reasoning about Sally's perceptual evidence and belief formation: Sally didn't see Anne move the marble to the box, so she still believes it is where she last left it, in the basket.
Dr. Kosinski presented 10 large language models with 40 unique variations of these theory of mind tests -- descriptions of situations like the Sally-Anne test, in which a person (Sally) forms a false belief. Then he asked the models questions about those situations, prodding them to see whether they would attribute false beliefs to the characters involved and accurately predict their behavior. He found that GPT-3.5, released in November 2022, did so 90 percent of the time, and GPT-4, released in March 2023, did so 95 percent of the time.
The conclusion? Machines have theory of mind.
But soon after these results were released, Tomer Ullman, a psychologist at Harvard University, responded with a set of his own experiments, showing that small adjustments in the prompts could completely change the answers generated by even the most sophisticated large language models. If a container was described as transparent, the machines would fail to infer that someone could see into it. The machines had difficulty taking into account the testimony of people in these situations, and sometimes couldn't distinguish between an object being inside a container and being on top of it.
Maarten Sap, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University, fed more than 1,000 theory of mind tests into large language models and found that the most advanced transformers, like ChatGPT and GPT-4, passed only about 70 percent of the time. (In other words, they were 70 percent successful at attributing false beliefs to the people described in the test situations.) The discrepancy between his data and Dr. Kosinski's could come down to differences in the testing, but Dr. Sap said that even passing 95 percent of the time would not be evidence of real theory of mind. Machines usually fail in a patterned way, unable to engage in abstract reasoning and often making "spurious correlations," he said.
Dr. Ullman noted that machine learning researchers have struggled over the past couple of decades to capture the flexibility of human knowledge in computer models. This difficulty has been a "shadow finding," he said, hanging behind every exciting innovation. Researchers have shown that language models will often give wrong or irrelevant answers when primed with unnecessary information before a question is posed; some chatbots were so thrown off by hypothetical discussions about talking birds that they eventually claimed that birds could speak. Because their reasoning is sensitive to small changes in their inputs, scientists have called the knowledge of these machines "brittle."
Dr. Gopnik compared the theory of mind of large language models to her own understanding of general relativity. "I have read enough to know what the words are," she said. "But if you asked me to make a new prediction or to say what Einstein's theory tells us about a new phenomenon, I'd be stumped because I don't really have the theory in my head." By contrast, she said, human theory of mind is linked with other common-sense reasoning mechanisms; it stands strong in the face of scrutiny.
In general, Dr. Kosinski's work and the responses to it fit into the debate about whether the capacities of these machines can be compared to the capacities of humans -- a debate that divides researchers who work on natural language processing. Are these machines stochastic parrots, or alien intelligences, or fraudulent tricksters? A 2022 survey of the field found that, of the 480 researchers who responded, 51 percent believed that large language models could eventually "understand natural language in some nontrivial sense," and 49 percent believed that they could not.
Dr. Ullman doesn't discount the possibility of machine understanding or machine theory of mind, but he is wary of attributing human capacities to nonhuman things. He noted a famous 1944 study by Fritz Heider and Marianne Simmel, in which participants were shown an animated movie of two triangles and a circle interacting. When the subjects were asked to write down what transpired in the movie, nearly all described the shapes as people.
"Lovers in the two-dimensional world, no doubt; little triangle number-two and sweet circle," one participant wrote. "Triangle-one (hereafter known as the villain) spies the young love. Ah!"
It's natural and often socially required to explain human behavior by talking about beliefs, desires, intentions and thoughts. This tendency is central to who we are -- so central that we sometimes try to read the minds of things that don't have minds, at least not minds like our own.

Recently, Michal Kosinski, a psychologist at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, made just that argument: that large language models such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and GPT-4 — next-word prediction machines trained on vast amounts of text from the internet — have developed theory of mind. His studies have not been peer reviewed, but they prompted scrutiny and conversation among cognitive scientists, who have been trying to take the often-asked question these days — Can ChatGPT do this ? — and move it into the realm of more robust scientific inquiry. What capacities do these models have, and how might they change our understanding of our own minds?
“Psychologists wouldn’t accept any claim about the capacities of young children just based on anecdotes about your interactions with them, which is what seems to be happening with ChatGPT,” said Alison Gopnik, a psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and one of the first researchers to look into theory of mind in the 1980s. “You have to do quite careful and rigorous tests.”
Kosinski’s previous research showed that neural networks trained to analyze facial features such as nose shape, head angle and emotional expression could predict people’s political views and sexual orientation with a startling degree of accuracy (about 72% in the first case and about 80% in the second case). His recent work on large language models uses classic theory of mind tests that measure the ability of children to attribute false beliefs to other people.
A famous example is the Sally-Anne test, in which a girl, Anne, moves a marble from a basket to a box when another girl, Sally, isn’t looking. To know where Sally will look for the marble, researchers claimed, a viewer would have to exercise theory of mind, reasoning about Sally’s perceptual evidence and belief formation: Sally didn’t see Anne move the marble to the box, so she still believes it is where she last left it, in the basket.
Kosinski presented 10 large language models with 40 unique variations of these theory of mind tests — descriptions of situations such as the Sally-Anne test, in which a person (Sally) forms a false belief. Then he asked the models questions about those situations, prodding them to see whether they would attribute false beliefs to the characters involved and accurately predict their behavior. He found that GPT-3.5, released in November, did so 90% of the time, and GPT-4, released this month, did so 95% of the time.
The conclusion? Machines have theory of mind.
But soon after these results were released, Tomer Ullman, a psychologist at Harvard University, responded with a set of his own experiments, showing that small adjustments in the prompts could completely change the answers generated by even the most sophisticated large language models. If a container was described as transparent, the machines would fail to infer that someone could see into it. The machines had difficulty taking into account the testimony of people in these situations, and sometimes couldn’t distinguish between an object being inside a container and being on top of it.
Maarten Sap, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University, fed more than 1,000 theory of mind tests into large language models and found that the most advanced transformers, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, passed only about 70% of the time. (In other words, they were 70% successful at attributing false beliefs to the people described in the test situations.) The discrepancy between his data and Kosinski’s could come down to differences in the testing, but Sap said that even passing 95% of the time would not be evidence of real theory of mind. Machines usually fail in a patterned way, unable to engage in abstract reasoning and often making “spurious correlations,” he said.
Ullman noted that machine learning researchers have struggled over the past couple of decades to capture the flexibility of human knowledge in computer models. This difficulty has been a “shadow finding,” he said, hanging behind every exciting innovation. Researchers have shown that language models will often give wrong or irrelevant answers when primed with unnecessary information before a question is posed; some chatbots were so thrown off by hypothetical discussions about talking birds that they eventually claimed that birds could speak. Because their reasoning is sensitive to small changes in their inputs, scientists have called the knowledge of these machines “brittle.”
Gopnik compared the theory of mind of large language models to her own understanding of general relativity. “I have read enough to know what the words are,” she said. “But if you asked me to make a new prediction or to say what Einstein’s theory tells us about a new phenomenon, I’d be stumped because I don’t really have the theory in my head.” By contrast, she said, human theory of mind is linked with other common-sense reasoning mechanisms; it stands strong in the face of scrutiny.
In general, Kosinski’s work and the responses to it fit into the debate about whether the capacities of these machines can be compared to the capacities of humans — a debate that divides researchers who work on natural language processing. Are these machines stochastic parrots, or alien intelligences, or fraudulent tricksters? A 2022 survey of the field found that, of the 480 researchers who responded, 51% believed that large language models could eventually “understand natural language in some nontrivial sense,” and 49% believed that they could not.
Ullman doesn’t discount the possibility of machine understanding or machine theory of mind, but he is wary of attributing human capacities to nonhuman things. He noted a famous 1944 study by Fritz Heider and Marianne Simmel, in which participants were shown an animated movie of two triangles and a circle interacting. When the subjects were asked to write down what transpired in the movie, nearly all described the shapes as people.
“Lovers in the two-dimensional world, no doubt; little triangle number-two and sweet circle,” one participant wrote. “Triangle-one (hereafter known as the villain) spies the young love. Ah!”
It’s natural and often socially required to explain human behavior by talking about beliefs, desires, intentions and thoughts. This tendency is central to who we are — so central that we sometimes try to read the minds of things that don’t have minds, at least not minds like our own.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The military is using thousands of artillery shells a day as it tries to hold the eastern city, which could jeopardize a planned springtime campaign.
The Ukrainian military is firing thousands of artillery shells a day as it tries to hold the eastern city of Bakhmut, a pace that American and European officials say is unsustainable and could jeopardize a planned springtime campaign that they hope will prove decisive.
The bombardment has been so intense that the Pentagon raised concerns with Kyiv recently after several days of nonstop artillery firing, two U.S. officials said, highlighting the tension between Ukraine's decision to defend Bakhmut at all costs and its hopes for retaking territory in the spring. One of those officials said the Americans warned Ukraine against wasting ammunition at a key time.
With so much riding on a Ukrainian counteroffensive, the United States and Britain are preparing to ship thousands of NATO and Soviet-type artillery rounds and rockets to help shore up supplies for a coming Ukrainian offensive.
But a senior American defense official described that as a "last-ditch effort" because Ukraine's allies do not have enough ammunition to keep up with Ukraine's pace and their stocks are critically low. Western manufacturers are ramping up production, but it will take many months for new supplies to begin meeting demand.
This has put Kyiv in an increasingly perilous position: Its troops are likely to have one meaningful opportunity this year to go on the offensive, push back Russian forces and retake land that was occupied after the invasion began last year. And they will probably have do it while contending with persistent ammunition shortages.
Adding to the uncertainty, Ukrainian casualties have been so severe that commanders will have to decide whether to send units to defend Bakhmut or use them in a spring offensive, several of the officials said. Many of the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.
On Thursday Poland said it would send four Soviet-designed MIG warplanes to Ukraine, in what would be the first delivery of fighter jets by a NATO country and a sign that Western allies are committed to finding ways to enhance Ukraine's chances.
But artillery has become the defining weapon of the war in Ukraine, including howitzers and mortars. Both sides have powerful antiaircraft systems, so the fighting is being waged largely on the ground. As the year-old war continues, a major factor in who perseveres is which side has enough ammunition and troops.
More than 200,000 Russians are estimated to have been wounded or killed since the start of the war. The Ukrainian figure is more than 100,000. Russia can conscript forces from its population, which is around three times the size of Ukraine's, but both sides are contending with ammunition shortages. Russia's formations are firing more ammunition than Ukraine's.
"We need shells for mortars," a Ukrainian soldier fighting in Bakhmut said in recent days. He said his battalion had not been resupplied. A Ukrainian tank commander, whose T-80 tank has been used in the city's defense, said he had barely any tank ammunition left.
Another commander in a brigade that has been instrumental in holding Bakhmut posted on Facebook on Tuesday that there was a "catastrophic shortage of shells." He described an incident in which his unit disabled an advanced Russian T-90 tank but was prohibited from firing artillery to finish it off because "it's too expensive."
The Pentagon estimated that Ukraine was firing several thousand artillery shells a day across the 600-mile front line, which includes Bakhmut, a city that is almost surrounded by Russian troops. Moscow's forces control roughly half the city and are encroaching on the supply lines the Ukrainians need to defend the rest.
The United States hopes to produce 90,000 artillery shells per month, but that is likely to take two years. The European Union is pooling resources to manufacture and buy about a million shells. That, too, will take time. And a secret British task force is leading an effort to find and buy Soviet-style ammunition, which Ukraine primarily relies on, from around the world.
Ukraine has roughly 350 Western-supplied howitzers and, even with battlefield losses and mechanical failures, significantly more Soviet-era artillery pieces.
"We have to support them more, to provide more weapons," Lithuania's vice foreign minister, Egidijus Meilunas, said in an interview on Wednesday. He cast doubt on the effectiveness of aging Soviet-era weapons and said, "The best solution would be to find possibilities to increase production in NATO member states."
That is not easy, even for some of the most advanced militaries in the world. The United States and its allies did not stockpile weaponry in anticipation of supplying an artillery war. Hundreds of new tanks and armored vehicles that are being sent to Ukraine will certainly aid its advance, but without enough artillery support, their effect will be limited.
For now, the Biden administration remains confident that Bakhmut will not sap Ukraine's ammunition and troops so much that it dooms a springtime counteroffensive. But the longer the battle rages, the more likely that is to change.
"The Ukrainians are taking casualties. I do not mean to underestimate that," John F. Kirby, the White House National Security Council spokesman, said on Tuesday. "But they are not taking casualties on the size and scale that the Russians are."
But numbers alone do not tell the story of Bakhmut, the site of one of the war's bloodiest battles. The Kremlin-backed Wagner paramilitary group is using units of former prisoners to break through Ukrainian lines. That means battle-hardened troops from Ukraine are dying as they defend the city against less trained Russian foot soldiers.
Bakhmut is a small city, but it provides road access farther east and has also become symbolically important for both sides. "There is no part of Ukraine about which one can say that it can be abandoned," President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said this month. His office announced plans this week to further bolster the city's defenses.
The Biden administration has not put a timeline on the battle there, saying that only Ukraine could make a decision about whether to pull back or keep fighting.
Camille Grand, a defense expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, who until last fall was NATO's assistant secretary general for defense investment, said it was both politically important and militarily necessary for Ukraine to show that it would defend its territory. But, he said, "they need to demonstrate that it was worthwhile."
That is not to say there are no tactical reasons for continuing the protracted slog in Bakhmut, he said. It could drain Russia of resources and prevent its troops from heading farther west, where it could conceivably win another breakthrough for Moscow.
"That would be the logic of expending so much blood and ammo on Bakhmut," Mr. Grand said. "The alternative is that they got dragged into a situation that, in the long term, plays in Russia's favor and now it's difficult to get out of it."
He added: "Is it correct to assess that the Ukrainians are tapping into their reserves, putting them in a more difficult position to do this open artillery barrage that would be needed to start an offensive against fortified Russian lines elsewhere?
"That's the big question now."

But, he said, “they need to demonstrate that it was worthwhile.”
That is not to say there are no tactical reasons for continuing the protracted slog in Bakhmut, he said. It could drain Russia of resources and prevent its troops from heading farther west, where it could conceivably win another breakthrough for Moscow.
“That would be the logic of expending so much blood and ammo on Bakhmut,” Grand said. “The alternative is that they got dragged into a situation that, in the long term, plays in Russia’s favor and now it’s difficult to get out of it.”
He added: “Is it correct to assess that the Ukrainians are tapping into their reserves, putting them in a more difficult position to do this open artillery barrage that would be needed to start an offensive against fortified Russian lines elsewhere?
“That’s the big question now.”

Full text: A new account of the John Birch Society by Matthew Dallek charts its history -- and outsize influence on the contemporary Republican Party.
BIRCHERS: How the John Birch Society Radicalized the American Right, by Matthew Dallek
Before the 2016 presidential election and Trumpism, before Sarah Palin and the Tea Party, there was the John Birch Society: Founded in 1958 at a secret meeting of 12 men, the group was named after a young missionary and intelligence officer who was killed by Mao's Communist forces in 1945. As the historian Matthew Dallek explains in "Birchers," his illuminating new account of the society's right-wing activism amid postwar prosperity, a number of the founding members were business leaders, and all of them felt deeply aggrieved.
"Rich, white and almost uniformly Christian," Dallek writes, the first Birchers nevertheless believed they had been "abandoned" and "exiled to the margins." They railed against Communism, the civil rights movement and the New Deal. Their fulminations were often dismissed as ludicrous and paranoid; in the movie "Dr. Strangelove," Brig. Gen. Jack D. Ripper's rant about a commie plot "to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids" wasn't even that much of a parody. For the last six decades, a standard Bircher talking point has revolved around the evils of a fluoridated water supply (or, as the group's website currently has it, "a form of government mass medication of citizens in violation of their individual right to choose which medicines they ingest").
But for all the spectacle offered by the lurid politics of the right-wing fringe, Dallek urges us to pay attention to how the organization, at least in its first decade or so, took care to keep a foot planted in the mainstream. "Countless Birchers were rational, educated, skilled political operatives," he writes, detailing their mix of canny know-how and intemperate rage. It would turn out to be a potent combination for American conservatism and, as a consequence, the Republican Party.
The story that Dallek tells is full of mutual distrust and exploitation. Birchers despised the establishment -- not just liberals but also mainstream conservatives. They were especially disgusted by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a moderate Republican. Robert Welch, the retired candy manufacturer who initiated the first secret meeting of the society, once described Eisenhower as a "dedicated, conscious agent of the communist conspiracy."
Yet the Birch Society wasn't about to relegate itself to being some third-party splinter group, doomed to irrelevance. A survey in the mid-1960s found that 60 percent of Birchers -- who claimed 80,000 members at the time -- identified as Republicans. By inserting themselves into the party's coalition, they could make up for their small numbers with actual power, Dallek writes, ensuring "that their Armageddon-like sensibility couldn't be ignored."
Similarly, Dallek shows how hope sprang eternal among mainstream Republicans, who thought they could wrest some advantages out of the arrangement, too. They "wanted Birch energy and money but not the taint," contorting themselves to placate the Birchers as much as they could without offending those constituents who weren't all that keen on apocalyptic tirades and eruptions of rank bigotry. But appeasement could never satisfy the unappeasable. Once Birchers got a taste of power, they weren't inclined to tack toward the center and curtail their extremist ambitions in a spirit of compromise.
"They spoiled for confrontations," Dallek writes, adding later, "The G.O.P. establishment's effort to court this fringe and keep it in the coalition allowed it to gain a foothold and eventually cannibalize the entire party."
Most of Dallek's book charts the early years of the Birch Society, until the mid-1970s. Despite the group's organizational feats, and an increasingly fragmented political landscape, a postwar consensus prevailed; after all, World War II wasn't too distant a reminder of the real dangers posed by extremism. The press -- a favorite Bircher target -- still commanded enough public attention that by shining "a bright light" on right-wing radicalism it could "freeze it out of the mainstream."
Such notoriety did generate surging numbers of recruits, but the rapid growth in membership turned out to be destabilizing. Dallek says that many new Birchers in the mid- to late 1960s "thrived on discord and menace." An aura of respectability, which still had currency in that era, was ever harder to maintain.
The organization also suffered a series of blows at the hands of the Anti-Defamation League, which started an espionage program called Birch Watchers, designed to infiltrate and discredit the Birchers. The A.D.L.'s tactics were surreptitious and in some cases, Dallek says, perhaps even illegal. That an organization dedicated to civil rights issues would resort to subterfuge -- methods that would seem to contradict its core values -- indicates just how much the A.D.L. believed was at stake. The league argued that it was defending American democracy, and so the "righteous ends justified the morally questionable means."
In addition to Dallek's scrupulous research, he knows how to tell this story with a clarifying elegance and restraint. Even as the John Birch Society started to wilt as an organization, the belligerent style and ideology it seeded in the Republican Party continued to grow. Certain elements of the Bircher agenda -- prohibiting sex education, combing through textbooks for socialist propaganda -- are so reminiscent of right-wing programs in red states right now that Dallek knows he doesn't have to overplay his hand. The same goes for some of the Birchers' conspiracy theories, which included a notion floated in the group's flagship magazine that the peace sign was a communist symbol borrowed from the "eyes of the demon" on a medieval woodcut. It's the kind of confabulation -- bizarrely specific and deeply inane -- worthy of QAnon.
One of Dallek's main arguments is that the Bircher takeover of American conservatism wasn't inevitable -- it was "halting" and "contingent," and required the acquiescence of a Republican establishment that should have known better than to risk giving its insurgent right flank any power. "Treating the fringe as allies rather than banishing it was a choice," he writes.
The decision may have been inflected by a kind of desperation -- a fear that the standard Republican playbook wasn't cutting it anymore. But the choice, as Dallek shows in "Birchers," was still there: Stand on democratic principles, even if it might mean losing an election, or exact a partisan victory, whatever the cost.

Q: I take forever to fall asleep and wake frequently throughout the night. I've heard cannabis can help -- is that true?
Few things can throw off your day more than a night of bad sleep. Insufficient sleep can worsen mood, sap energy and has even been linked with a range of health issues including dementia, depression, heart disease and a weakened immune system.
Between 2013 and 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than a third of adults in the United States reported getting less than the recommended seven hours of sleep each night. And in 2020, a Department of Health and Human Services study found, about 8 percent of adults reported that they regularly took sleep medications to help them fall or stay asleep. Some of those people, studies suggest, may be smoking, vaping or consuming cannabis products such as marijuana to help with their sleep.
So we asked some experts, including cannabis and sleep researchers, a sleep psychologist and a cannabis pharmacist, to explain cannabis's effects on sleep and how its various chemical compounds influence those effects.
Will cannabis help me sleep?
In a survey published in 2022 of more than 27,000 medical marijuana users in the United States and Canada, nearly half cited sleep as a physical health reason for its use.
But it's tricky to explain exactly how cannabis affects sleep because the studies that have been done are limited, and their results are often mixed, said Vyga Kaufmann, an assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Colorado Boulder.
The two main active compounds in cannabis -- tetrahydrocannabinol (or THC, which is largely responsible for getting people high) and cannabidiol (or CBD, which does not cause a high) -- seem to affect sleep in different ways, said Cinnamon Bidwell, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor of cognitive science also at the University of Colorado Boulder.
For instance, limited studies have found that low doses of THC can improve sleep and high doses can worsen it, whereas the inverse is true of CBD. This makes studying cannabis and sleep challenging, Dr. Bidwell said -- especially because different cannabis products may have varying ratios of the compounds.
That being said, researchers from one review of 26 studies that was published in 2020 reported that there was "promising preliminary evidence" that cannabinoid therapies, including THC and CBD, should be investigated as possible treatments for sleep issues like insomnia, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome and nightmares related to post-traumatic stress disorder.
Cannabis's effects on sleep and sleepiness can also be influenced by how you take it, said Dr. Ashima Sahni, a pulmonologist and sleep specialist at the University of Illinois College of Medicine. Oral forms, like pills or edibles, will take longer to kick in than inhaled forms, she said, but their effects on sleep will last longer throughout the night. Inhaled cannabis, via vaping or smoking, will yield faster results, but they won't last as long. Of course, Dr. Sahni added, vaping and smoking can come with certain health concerns including damage to the lungs and inflamed airways.
There is also some evidence that cannabis might indirectly help with sleep by alleviating chronic pain and anxiety -- the two top concerns motivating new patients to try medical cannabis, said Rahim Dhalla, a pharmacist specializing in medical cannabis in Ottawa, Canada, who has studied patient experiences with cannabis for sleep. Though research in this area is "limited" and "the data are kind of all over the place," Dr. Kaufmann said.
What to consider before trying cannabis for sleep
In her clinical experience, Dr. Bidwell said that people who use cannabis products for sleep seem to be the most satisfied with them when they use them every now and then but not every day. This is because using THC too frequently can lead to a tolerance or dependency, she said, which can reverse the benefits of cannabis on sleep.
"As you start taking it more chronically, you fall into this trap that, for the same amount of effect, you have to go up in the quantity," Dr. Sahni added. And eventually, you might get to a point where it doesn't work at all.
At the same time, you might become so dependent on it that you have to keep taking it to stave off withdrawal symptoms. In such people with marijuana addictions, Dr. Bidwell said, stopping its use can result in symptoms like anxiety, irritability, nausea and even unsettling dreams that can disrupt sleep. "That's one of the main reasons they go back to using it, or why they can't fully quit," she said, "because of how hard it is to sleep as part of that withdrawal."
And some people who use too much THC can report a "weed hangover" the next morning, which can include symptoms like fatigue, headache and dry eyes and mouth. Using CBD, however, does not seem to lead to a tolerance or dependency.
In Dr. Kaufmann's clinical experience, many of her patients want to try cannabis for sleep because they are wary of sleep medications. But she urges them to try some lifestyle strategies first: such as going to bed and waking up at the same times every day, reducing screen-time before bed, cutting out afternoon caffeine, getting daily exercise and keeping your bedroom cool, clean and comfortable.
For her patients with insomnia, Dr. Kaufmann recommended trying cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, or CBT-I -- a kind of talk therapy designed to help change the way you think about sleep. It's "the gold standard intervention for insomnia that has the longest lasting effects," she said, and patients usually aren't even aware that it's a possible treatment for them.
A major consideration for anyone curious about marijuana is that it's not legal everywhere in the United States. But even if you live in a state where it is legal, you should ask yourself some questions before trying cannabis for sleep, Dr. Dhalla said: Are you taking any medications that could possibly interact with it? (The blood thinner warfarin and several epilepsy drugs are of particular concern with cannabis products.) Would you like something you can use everyday or only as needed? If you're looking for an everyday sleep aid, he said, cannabis is not your best bet.
Dr. Bidwell said that if you're set on trying it, start with the lowest dose possible to see how you react. Dr. Sahni also cautioned that because these products are poorly regulated, it's difficult to know exactly what you're getting and whether it's safe.
The bottom line is that we need more research, Dr. Kaufmann said. We want people to feel satisfied with their sleep, she said -- so if cannabis is working for you, great. But if you've never done it and you're looking for help with sleep, it should not be the first thing you turn to.

Before You Make It Big, You've Got to Pay the Bills: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: A group show at the Blanton Museum of Art breaks the taboo on artists discussing, and drawing on, their day jobs. Yet this stigma still exists.
There's a scene in the 1996 movie "Basquiat" where the incandescent young painter (played by Jeffrey Wright) has a handyman gig at a gallery. Willem Dafoe, making a cameo as an electrician, climbs down a ladder and delivers the immortal line: "You know, I'm an artist too." Here are the two sides of the myth: the obscure martyr unsoiled by commercial success; and the unbridled genius who can't help but have it all.
In reality, most artists, even most great ones, also have day jobs. During the late 1950s and early 60s, the staff at MoMA harbored grand ambitions. The painters Robert Ryman and Robert Mangold were guards, curator and critic Lucy Lippard a "page" in the museum library, minimalist Sol LeWitt worked the desk and sculptor Dan Flavin ran the elevator. (Miriam Takaezu, an employee in Personnel and sister to the famous ceramist Toshiko Takaezu, apparently took it upon herself to hire artists.)
Work from this MoMA cohort introduces "Day Jobs," a group show of 38 artists at the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, Texas. The exhibition blows through the polite separation between artwork and money work. Not only does it name, in wall label after wall label, what each artist did to keep the lights on -- it demonstrates how artists drew techniques, subjects, even inspiration from their diurnal grind.
Put another way, the show refutes the idea of the spontaneous generation of masterpieces. Far from it. Great artists need the world, maybe more than it needs them. "I think we overlook how much mundane moments can shape creative discoveries and directions," the curator, Veronica Roberts, who's now the director of Stanford University's Cantor Arts Center, told me. When Frank Stella moved to New York in 1958, he painted houses. In 1959, he had his precocious MoMA debut: canvases covered with black enamel stripes the width of a housepainter's brush. "When we view artists as living in this rarefied realm," Roberts said, "we do a disservice to ourselves and to them."
Which might be why the "Worst Job Ever," a recent help wanted ad from an "Art World Family" seeking a combination personal assistant, babysitter, gardener and "dog systems" manager for less than $ 100,000 a year, got people's hackles up. It wasn't so much the conditions (unfortunately common enough), not even the post's arch tone -- but the fact that there was an artist behind it, asking to escape the surly gravity that holds the rest of us down: trying to be an artist without the world.
Why is it so hard to acknowledge that artists work for money? The art business puts the precariat and the bourgeoisie in proximity, which can certainly breed resentment. But it's more than that. In the Basquiat/Electrician dualism, we're given to believe that true talent will be rewarded, while those who change light bulbs for a living just aren't that good. In the myth of artistic meritocracy, a day job is the mark of failure.
Pressure also comes from fellow artists. Virginia L. Montgomery, a video artist in "Day Jobs," told me one of her (more privileged) classmates at Yale called her a sellout because she worked. Howardena Pindell, also in the show, climbed the ladder as a curator at MoMA for over a decade while developing her style of abstract, pointillist collage. (She had two separate résumés.) Pindell recalls misguided peers blaming her for gatekeeping. "One African American woman artist would heckle me in public settings and call me at home with veiled threats," she told me, "and would say I was the reason MoMA did not collect her work."
"Artists have this ambivalent relationship to their day jobs," said Hannah Wohl, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of California Santa Barbara and the author of a book on creativity and the art world. Day jobs provide stability through the feast-or-famine cycles of gallery sales. At the same time, "being able to give up your day job is a sign of upward mobility."
Still, it's not that simple. A job also signals a certain salt-of-the-earth authenticity. "I'm thinking of one instance of a gallerist who was bragging about starting to represent an artist while they still taught at the Y.M.C.A.," said Wohl. "Or another dealer bragging about how she started representing this artist who used to be an art handler at her gallery."
"Like everyone else," said Wohl, "artists want their success to appear deserved. I've noticed that artists with wealthy families and family connections often downplay these advantages. One way they do this is by having a day job and acting like this is something they need. It's more shameful in some ways to not need a day job than to have one."
All of the artists in "Day Jobs" needed their gigs at the time. Jeff Koons, aptly represented at the Blanton by his gleaming steel bust of Sun King Louis XIV, was a successful commodities broker before he conquered the art market. (He also sold MoMA memberships.) Even Andy Warhol got his start illustrating shoe ads.
But maybe quitting isn't the goal. "I'm grateful that I have a day job," said Montgomery, one of two artists in "Day Jobs" who still have theirs. "If I was constantly thinking about myself and my own needs all the time, I would go a bit crazy." Montgomery works as a graphic facilitator, transcribing corporate brainstorming sessions and TED talks into symbols in real time. Her videos are likewise full of morphing and empathic imagery, like a luna moth hatching from a ponytail. Ragen Moss, a lawyer since 2005, sculpts bodily, glassy, cocoon-like forms inscribed with legalese. Because of her career, she told me, "I feel authorized to ask huge questions: Where did law begin? What is it for? Who does it serve?"
I asked both Moss and Montgomery if they would quit if they could. Neither said yes. Their jobs ground their art in experience. And both mentioned the value of coming into contact with different kinds of people -- a point echoed throughout "Day Jobs" under subheadings like "Caregivers" and "Service Industry." Violette Bule's "Dream America," a photographic diptych of a dishwasher carrying a tray of red, white and blue plates and the stars and stripes, evokes August Sander's famous portrait of a bulging, burdened bricklayer. Bule's restaurant job brought her intimate knowledge of the tenacity and exploitation underlying more abstract debates about immigration. The art is stronger for it: less topical, more enduring.
Inside access can also sharpen critique. Barbara Kruger, known for pithy feminist slogans and bold graphics that have become selfie magnets, designed and edited magazines.
And Matthew Angelo Harrison, an emerging artist from Detroit, modeled prototypes for Ford with 3-D printers and CNC routers, then adapted that technology to print clay copies of looted artifacts. At the Blanton, Harrison contributes a "found" West African statue alongside a car headlight, both vitrified in resin, in a caustic conflation of industry and imperialism.
As Roberts admits, curating the show, she sidestepped two huge categories of common artist gigs: teaching, and assisting other artists. A work by Manuel Rodríguez-Delgado involving a climate-sealed notebook and custom shipping crates glances off the unwieldy category of preparator work, and the wall label for Sol LeWitt's "Wall Drawing #48," per his instructions, names the people who drew it. Who hung the rest of the "Day Jobs" show? Who will secret it away when it's done? That crate would take more than one exhibition to unpack.
The need for such a reckoning is evident in the 115,000 followers of Art Handler magazine, an Instagram account and erstwhile journal focused on the art world's back of house. Clynton Lowry, an art handler and artist who has shown at the Kitchen, in New York, started the project in 2015. "I was interested in hearing artists not just describing these jobs as a sideline," Lowry told me, "but something that's integrated in their lives, and in their thinking as artists."
While union drives might make the news, it falls to Art Handler to represent, and advocate for, that profession's particular view of culture. Lowry makes the point that the art world praises certain multihyphenates -- curator-dealer-writers or artist-educators. But that clout "isn't translating to these below-the-line roles."
The label on my own canned latte says it's so inspiring I might quit my day job. A subway ad for an art school tells me, if I love what I do, it's not work. The semiotic landscape of consumer society urges us to pretend that gigs are art forms, when in fact they're just jobs that sap your creativity. Of course, says society, if you want to be a true artist, you can always suffer and starve. In this light, the intertwined but distinct relationship of artworks and day jobs is something to be recognized, and protected: no shame in saying, "You know, I'm an artist too." And no shame in confiding: "You know, I'm an art handler too." You don't have to be poor to be a great artist. You do have to live in the world.

Full text: Ukrainians say Russia's Wagner mercenary group is running low on fighters recruited from prisons, used in attacks on Bakhmut, where Ukraine has also endured heavy losses.
KYIV, Ukraine -- Russia's Wagner mercenary group has been forced to use more of its professional recruits in Bakhmut to replace its depleted supply of enlisted prisoners, who are perishing by the thousands in the longest battle of the war, a Ukrainian official said on Tuesday.
The claim suggested that Ukraine sees an opportunity, despite the heavy casualties it has suffered in the eastern city, to exhaust Wagner's nearly suicidal prisoner assaults, which Ukraine's commanders regard as one of Russia's most effective tactics.
"This is their last stand," Col. Serhiy Cherevaty, a spokesman for Ukraine's eastern group of forces, told Radio Liberty in an interview, referring to Wagner's forces in Bakhmut, where Russia and Ukraine's vicious, monthslong struggle has left thousands of soldiers dead and the city in rubble.
Ukrainian officials have claimed that nearly 30,000 of Wagner's 50,000 troops have deserted or been killed or wounded, many around Bakhmut. That number could not be independently verified, and Ukraine has not disclosed its own losses in the region. Russia's defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, claimed on Tuesday that Ukraine had lost more than 11,000 troops in February.
As the fight for Bakhmut appears to be entering a decisive phase, both sides are trying to justify their staggering losses in a minor city of limited strategic value by presenting them as benefiting their cause. Each makes essentially the same claim: that the fighting there is worth the horrific cost because it is wearing down the enemy.
Wagner's founder, Yegveny V. Prigozhin, has repeatedly said that his group's triple-digit daily casualty rates are sucking experienced Ukrainian units into what he calls the "Bakhmut meat-grinder," upsetting their offensive plans elsewhere.
President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Monday that rather than withdraw from the city, as had been rumored, Ukraine would send reinforcements into Bakhmut, where Ukrainian commanders say the fighting has tied down enormous Russian forces.
The true strategic legacy of the battle will most likely be ultimately written by its victors.
Wagner's mercenaries have significantly helped Russia edge toward encircling Bakhmut, largely by throwing waves of former inmates toward Ukrainian positions, wearing Kyiv's forces down at heavy cost. "Almost all of them have been killed" in Bakhmut, Colonel Cherevaty said of the prisoner units.
Some analysts say that if Ukraine can eliminate Russia's prisoner soldiers in Bakhmut, they will not have to face their attack waves elsewhere. The number of "Russian convict recruits suitable for combat is not limitless," the Institute for the Study of War, a research group in Washington, said in a communiqué this week. The group echoed Ukraine's assessment that Wagner units were shifting toward higher-quality special forces because of the high losses suffered by prison recruits.
On Monday, Mr. Prigozhin himself appeared to sound an alarm, calling for urgent reinforcements and ammunition to withstand a potential Ukrainian counteroffensive he said could not only relieve Bakhmut's besieged defenders, but even cut off the Wagner attackers. "Otherwise, we're all in" trouble, he said, using an expletive in an audio message published on social media.
Mr. Prigozhin has suggested that his growing public feud with Russia's Defense Ministry last month has cost him access to Russian prisons, where since July he was able to enlist tens of thousands of inmates with a promise of high salaries, social rehabilitation and freedom -- if they survive their deployments. He had called the loss of prison recruitment an attempt to "bleed out" Wagner of its "offensive potential."
U.S. intelligence officials in December estimated that Wagner comprised about 10,000 professional soldiers, recruited mostly from veterans of Russia's security forces, and 40,000 former inmates. Wagner defectors and Russian prison rights activists say inmates are thrown into battle after just two weeks of training, and are used mostly to charge Ukrainian positions in small, unprotected groups, in order to expose the location of enemy fire and dig foxholes for subsequent assault waves.
Wagner's leaders treat the prison units as expendable, with most of its members killed days or even hours after arriving at the front, according to Wagner defectors, Russian prison rights activists and Ukrainian officials and military commanders.
However, one inmate recruit who this month returned home after serving his six-month contract with Wagner, including around Bakhmut, has described his survival chances as a coin toss, suggesting that different Wagner commanders use varying assault tactics. The soldier said that of about 170 inmates who enlisted from his penal colony in Russia's Ivanov region last fall, about 80 have returned home without major injuries.
The soldier, who is not identified because of the threat of retribution, told his friends that he plans to return to the front for a new stint with Wagner, reflecting the relatively high salaries paid by the mercenary group and the limited work prospects for former prisoners.
Although Wagner lost its ability to recruit in prisons, units composed of inmates will almost certainly continue to appear in the war. Mr. Prigozhin and Russian human rights activists have said the Russian military, itself, has recently started recruiting inmates.
The Russian prison service still had more than 400,000 inmates at the start of the year, according to its website, suggesting a large remaining pool of potential recruits.
As for Wagner, Mr. Prigozhin has attempted to substitute the loss of prison access by redoubling efforts to attract professional fighters. Wagner recruitment appeals in recent weeks have appeared on billboards, social media and even on prime-time state television shows.
In addition, social media accounts affiliated with Wagner have intensified propaganda portraying the mercenary force as the preferred destination for Russian patriots.
In one video posted on social media channels last week, eight heavily armed men claiming to come from a demobilized Russian Army unit appeal to Mr. Prigozhin to accept them into his ranks. The video could not be independently verified, but hours later Mr. Prigozhin published an audio message accepting them.
"When people want to fight and not sit around firing ranges or bases, it's necessary to do it," he said.
Mr. Prigozhin and his allies claim that Wagner's main task in Bakhmut is not territorial gain, but the depletion of experienced Ukrainian units that could have been fighting in other sections of the 600-mile front line.
"The Ukrainian forces send all their combat-ready units to Bakhmut," Mr. Prigozhin said in late January.
As an example, some pro-war Russian military bloggers -- an influential group that closely tracks the war -- said the intensification of the Bakhmut battle had coincided with the end of Ukrainian advances in the Kreminna area farther north, where the Kremlin's forces appear to have regained the initiative in recent weeks. Some Western analysts have made the same point, saying that the fighting in Bakhmut is starting to sap Ukrainian strength before an expected counteroffensive.
That campaign will likely focus on the southern region of Zaporizhzhia, where Ukraine is building up forces, Col. Roman Kostenko, a member of Ukraine's Parliament who is serving in the country's military, told Ukrainian television on Monday.
Ukraine may try to approach the Russian-held port of Melitopol and drive a wedge between Russian forces in the Crimean Peninsula and those in eastern Ukraine, military analysts and Ukrainian officials say. "The Zaporizhzhia direction is as dangerous as the eastern one," Colonel Kostenko said, referring to parallel Russian efforts to control the area.
In another region of southern Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities urged residents on Tuesday to evacuate because of shelling by Russian forces, in a tacit acknowledgment that efforts to restore normal life to the area have been thwarted. Ukraine recaptured the city of Kherson last fall, but Russian troops remained on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River, in position to batter civilians and Ukrainian troops with artillery.
Heavy casualties in Bakhmut could hamper Ukraine's ability to mount a counteroffensive there or elsewhere, raising problems similar to those facing Russian commanders, analysts said.
The tenacious defense of Bakhmut has expended Russian manpower and ammunition, Michael Kofman, a Washington-based expert on the Russian military at the Center for Naval Analyses, wrote on Twitter on Sunday after visiting the Bakhmut area.
"Strategies can reach points of diminishing returns," he wrote. "This fight doesn't play to Ukraine's advantages as a force."

New York Drivers Make Electric Car Conversion: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ownership rates of electric cars have more than doubled in New York City and the surrounding area, propelled by more varied models, more charging stations and lower prices.
On weekdays, John Sibley motors down NY-17 from his home north of New York City, eventually crossing the George Washington Bridge into Manhattan and lurching through stop-and-go traffic to his job near Times Square. The 65-mile commute used to cost him a lot in gas.
Then last winter, he bought an electric car, a used Chevrolet Bolt.
"I was spending $ 100 a week on gas, and now I'm spending $ 100 a month on electricity," said Mr. Sibley, 47. "I'm the cheap early adopter."
He is one of many in New York City and its suburbs, as electric car ownership has shot up over the past several years. In 2020, there were about three electric vehicles per 1,000 people in the New York City metro region (excluding locations in Connecticut, which didn't collect data by county); today that number has more than doubled to about seven vehicles per 1,000, according to data from Atlas Public Policy, a research firm.
And while the earliest purchases of electric vehicles were mostly in affluent areas, over the past two years there has been explosive growth in ownership in moderate-income counties around the city -- including Orange County, N.Y., where Mr. Sibley, a sound engineer, found his Bolt for $ 21,000.
Various factors are propelling drivers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to convert to electric: more varied models, including trucks and S.U.V.s; more public charging stations; and significant government incentives. And for the first time, the prices of some electric cars are competitive with those of gas-powered vehicles -- without the expense of gas.
Yet there is also hesitation. Some drivers have concerns over the vehicles' range. It can be hard to lay hands on an electric vehicle because carmakers cannot keep up with demand. And while electric vehicles have become cheaper, they still cost about $ 60,000 on average.
For now, electric vehicles are still a rarity on the road, and the combustion engine is not in danger of completely disappearing any time soon, said Michelle Krebs, an executive analyst at Cox Automotive, a research and consulting firm.
"For electric vehicles to proliferate further in the future, we need electric vehicles that are affordable to the masses, which will be a challenge because the cost of the minerals used in the batteries have skyrocketed in price," Ms. Krebs said. "We need electric vehicles with longer range. We need an expanded electric vehicle charging network."
But the electric vehicle is ascendant, with the auto industry poised to invest half a trillion dollars in coming years to transition away from combustion engines. The growth in New York and neighboring states reflects the growing emergence of electric vehicles globally and the shifting perception in the United States of the cars -- from a niche choice for well-off environmentalists to a mainstream staple.
Today there are about 158,000 electric vehicles in the New York City metro region -- and that number is expected to increase tenfold by 2030, analysts say. The governors of New York and New Jersey have pledged that by 2035 all new vehicles sold in their states must produce zero carbon emissions, and Connecticut is considering a similar rule. There are more than five million passenger vehicles, such as cars, S.U.V.s, pickup trucks and vans, in the region.
The five boroughs have the most electric cars, about 27,000, according to Atlas Public Policy. There are also high concentrations of electric vehicles in affluent towns like Scarsdale in New York (1,332 cars), and Stamford (1,437 cars), Greenwich (1,186 cars), and Westport (1,233 cars) in Connecticut. High numbers can also be found in big cities like Newark and Jersey City.
Electric cars recently surpassed 5 percent of the U.S. auto market, a watershed moment, analysts say, that in other regions of the world has come before rapid growth.
"This is the biggest transformation in the industry since the migration from horseback travel to internal combustion engines," said Hoss Hassani, a vice president at General Motors.
The expansion of electric vehicle ownership is closely tied to the build-out of fast charger hubs. There are at least about 1,500 public chargers in New York City and its suburbs, according to Volta, a charging installation company -- up from 551 in 2019.
The federal government, aiming for half of all vehicles sold to be zero-emissions by 2030, has allocated $ 7.5 billion to installing public chargers nationwide over five years, including in the tristate area.
But Brandt Hastings, Volta's chief commercial officer, says that the region still has fewer public chargers per electric vehicle than the national average -- and that the entire country will need massive additional public and private investment to be able to support goals for reducing emissions.
"We have to build the charging network ahead of electric vehicle demand," he said.
Even for drivers who have convenient home charging, keeping electric cars charged can require lifestyle shifts. Kathy Mulholland, 58, of Asbury Park, N.J., likens identifying charging stations along her route to the flight plans she made as a student pilot. Many use apps on their phones.
Some adjust their driving to extend battery life, and avoid high speeds or quick acceleration -- or even the car's ambient heat, which can sap a battery. They look for other ways to keep warm. "I learned to drive with heated seats and a heated steering wheel, but no heat," said Joe Marganski, 67, of Guilford, Conn.
In the city, charging is more challenging, since many people live in apartments, without a dedicated parking spot. Municipal officials should find creative ways to make chargers convenient for apartment residents, said Alexia Melendez Martineau, the policy manager at Plug In America, a nonprofit organization advocating for an equitable conversion to electric vehicles. Policymakers should also think about how to make the cars accessible to lower-income people who might struggle to pay high upfront costs, she added.
The Biden administration's Justice40 Initiative requires 40 percent of the federal funds for public chargers to be deployed in underserved communities.
Officials are also thinking about equitably distributing the environmental benefits of the conversion. Their concern is not only that cars and trucks produce about one-fifth of the country's greenhouse gases -- but also that neighborhoods with high truck traffic carry higher levels of air pollution, along with higher rates of hospital admissions for asthma and heart and respiratory disease.
"We have an incredible number of vehicles that travel through New York City every day," said Meera Joshi, the city's deputy mayor for operations. "And so in a world in which we're quickly converting to electric vehicles, we have incredible potential to reduce the emissions."
New York State, Connecticut and New Jersey all offer consumer rebates to buy or lease new electric cars. There is also a possible $ 7,500 tax credit from the federal Inflation Reduction Act. The states offer subsidies for setting up charging at home and grants for municipalities to replace their fleets. A program that offered electric car commuters access to car pool lanes on Long Island may have contributed to the high rates of adoption in Long Island and Queens.
Many electric drivers say they are thinking about affordability.
"It's so cheap to run," said Jon Verzella, 47, of Verona, N.J., a director at a construction firm who commutes in a Chevrolet Bolt to his office in East Elmhurst, Queens. "There's no maintenance, and no oil changes -- there's no oil."
New York City area electric vehicles used to be mostly luxury cars. Now, among the 10 most popular electric vehicles in the New York City metropolitan area, the Tesla Model X (number three) is the only car priced above $ 100,000, and the Chevrolet Bolt (number seven) costs only about $ 27,000, according to an analysis for The Times by S&P Global Mobility. The most popular vehicle is the Tesla Model Y which starts at about $ 53,000, according to the Kelley Blue Book.
When Damali Alexander, 42, who now lives in Yonkers, leased her first electric car, a Tesla Model Y, she drove straight from the Brooklyn dealership to take her cousin for a ride.
Her cousin, Tiffany Tucker, had been hesitating about switching from a gas car to electric -- but that day in fall 2020, she loved the car's sleekness, its pickup and its quiet. "I just felt like it was the future," Ms. Tucker said.
Last month, she bought her own battery-powered car, a Genesis GV60.

Full text: Ever since Britain voted to leave the European Union, the question of Northern Ireland's border has bedeviled prime ministers. Rishi Sunak's effort to broker a deal is already under threat.
LONDON -- Brexit destroyed the careers of two recent British prime ministers, so resolving one of its most poisonous legacies was never going to be easy for the latest, Rishi Sunak.
Predictably enough, things are not going to plan.
Throughout Britain's tortuous exit from the European Union, successive prime ministers have sought to broker a deal with the bloc over a festering dispute: trade rules for Northern Ireland, where treatment of the border with Ireland, an E.U. member, has bedeviled negotiators for years.
An agreement was expected this week, until leaks of its contents prompted a backlash from Northern Irish politicians and some of Mr. Sunak's own lawmakers.
The question now is whether Mr. Sunak will push ahead with the deal, knowing that it could destabilize his leadership, providing a harsh reminder of the difficulties of solving one of the most intractable consequences of Brexit.
All of his predecessors since 2016 have had to wrestle with Brexit, and the issue cost two, David Cameron and Theresa May, their jobs as prime minister.
"It would be a massive gamble, it would be a gamble on the fate of his prime ministership," said Anand Menon, a professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King's College London. "And it's a gamble he has made without thinking about the odds or trying to stack the cards."
Even a modest internal rift would be another setback for a prime minister criticized over his party's poor poll ratings, the country's stagnant economy and the worst labor unrest in recent memory. But angering hard-line Brexit supporters could prompt ministerial resignations or even a leadership challenge against Mr. Sunak, Professor Menon said.
"Whether it is worth risking his whole premiership on this, I'm not sure."
Backing away now has dangers, too, because it could sap Mr. Sunak's authority.
"There is a lot to gain for the prime minister diplomatically and economically," said Katy Hayward, a professor of political sociology at Queen's University Belfast. "If he abandons all the progress at the behest of a minority of backbenchers, then that's setting the course for the rest of his premiership as a weak prime minister."
The prize would be considerable if Mr. Sunak could, in the words of another former prime minister, Boris Johnson, get Brexit done.
Easing concerns in Northern Ireland among politicians from the Democratic Unionist Party, who are determined to preserve their status within the United Kingdom, could help restore a power-sharing government in Belfast. (The D.U.P. is currently refusing to take part in protest at the trade rules.)
An agreement would avert the prospect of a trade war between Britain and the European Union, and satisfy President Biden, who has urged a solution to the impasse. It might also clear the way for a presidential visit around the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement that helped end decades of bloodshed in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles.
At the heart of the negotiation is the so-called Northern Ireland protocol, which Mr. Johnson agreed to and which aims to avoid the need for customs controls on goods crossing the politically sensitive border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.
The effect was that Northern Ireland, which remained part of the United Kingdom, also stayed within parts of Europe's single market, abiding by its economic rule book.
Though Mr. Johnson insisted to the contrary at the time, the protocol created a different trade barrier by requiring checks on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland, angering much of Northern Ireland's pro-Unionist community, which saw its status within the United Kingdom as being undermined.
Leaks of Mr. Sunak's proposed deal with Brussels suggest that goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland with the intention that they remain there would pass through a "green" channel without routine checks. Those ultimately destined for Ireland, and therefore Europe's single market, would pass through a "red" channel with more controls.
The agreement would minimize -- though not eliminate -- the role of the European Court of Justice, the bloc's top judicial authority, in determining trade disputes. Northern Ireland's politicians could have greater consultative powers before having to implement any new or updated European legislation.
But that does not seem enough for the D.U.P., which, despite holding only eight of 650 seats in Britain's Parliament, has influence over a hard-line pro-Brexit caucus of Conservative lawmakers known as the European Research Group.
Many D.U.P. supporters would like to see the protocol completely scrapped.
"The D.U.P. haven't prepared the ground for accepting the deal," said Professor Hayward. The party's voters, she said, "are very much of the view that the protocol needs to be removed before power sharing is restored."
Mr. Sunak also appears to have upset the party by leaving consultations until late last week, when an outline deal was already on the table in Brussels. According to news reports, talks with D.U.P. politicians in Belfast's Culloden Hotel went badly.
"He clearly flew over there and had a meeting which, by the more recent accounts, wasn't great," said Professor Menon.
The D.U.P. members are experienced negotiators and they "expect to be around the table and to be consulted and trusted with some behind-the-scenes information," said Professor Hayward.
"They really didn't want to be presented with a done deal," she said.
Nor does Mr. Sunak appear to have consulted widely among his own Conservative backbenchers until recent days. One former stalwart of the hard-line group, Chris Heaton-Harris, is now the Northern Ireland secretary, and his role in negotiations could reassure many Brexit-supporting Conservative lawmakers.
But a significant number of Conservative lawmakers are dissatisfied with Mr. Sunak for a variety of reasons.
Some blame him for the ouster of Mr. Johnson, whose supporters see him as a leader who could turn around the Conservative Party's electoral fortunes.
Mr. Johnson himself has stirred the pot by defending legislation he introduced that would enable the British government to override some of the protocol. That bill is moving through Parliament, but Brussels wants it removed as a part of the new agreement.
According to British news reports, Mr. Johnson has said axing it would be a "great mistake" -- an intervention that prompted a warning from George Osborne, a former chancellor of the Exchequer.
"He wants to bring down Rishi Sunak, and he will use any instrument to do it," Mr. Osborne recently told the broadcaster Channel 4. "If the Northern Ireland negotiations are that instrument, he will pick it up and hit Mr. Sunak over the head with it."
The continuing discord over the protocol underscores the ideological grip Brexit retains over the Conservative Party, even at a time when polls show a majority of voters now regard leaving the European Union as a mistake.
Mr. Sunak was a supporter of the Brexit campaign during the 2016 referendum, yet even he is viewed with suspicion by some hard-liners because he wants to strike a deal with Brussels and move on.
By contrast, the most hard-line Brexit supporters remain hostile to accommodation with the European Union and wedded to a more purist vision of sovereignty, post-Brexit deregulation and tax cutting, taking Britain ever further from Europe's economic orbit.
"It says something about the state of Brexit almost seven years after the referendum," said Professor Menon, "that it is not that we cannot agree on Leave or Remain, it is that Brexit supporters can't agree on Leave."

Full text: Ahead of a meeting of G20 finance ministers, the Treasury secretary offered a dark assessment of Russia's economy and warned China of the consequences of helping Moscow skirt U.S. sanctions.
BENGALURU, India -- Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said on Thursday that the United States would redouble its efforts to marshal global support to help Ukraine and warned that China would face repercussions if it helped Russia evade American sanctions.
She spoke as top policymakers from around the world gathered in southern India for a meeting that is expected to focus largely on accelerating a global economic recovery after three years of international crises. The warning to China underscores how the impact of the war continues to reverberate, straining ties between the world's two largest economies as they were attempting to stabilize their relationship.
"We have made clear that providing material support to Russia or assistance with any kind of systemic sanctions evasion would be a very serious concern for us," Ms. Yellen said. "We will certainly continue to make clear to the Chinese government and the companies and banks in their jurisdiction about what the rules are regarding our sanctions and the serious consequences they would face for violating them."
Ms. Yellen declined to describe specific U.S. intelligence about Russian attempts to avoid sanctions, but the Treasury Department has pointed to attempts by Russia to seek assistance from China to supply it with items, such as semiconductors, that face trade restrictions.
Trade data shows that China, along with countries including Turkey and some former Soviet republics, has stepped in to provide Russia with products that civilians or armed forces could use, including raw materials, smartphones, vehicles and computer chips. Biden administration officials have expressed concern that China could provide Russia with lethal weapons; however, China does not appear to have done so yet.
The United States has cracked down on some of the companies and organizations supplying goods and services to Russia. In January, it imposed sanctions on a Chinese company that had provided satellite imagery to the Wagner mercenary group, which has played a large role in the battle for eastern Ukraine. In December, it added two Chinese research institutes to a list of entities that supply the Russian military, restricting their access to U.S. technology.
On Thursday, Ms. Yellen made clear that the United States would crack down on sanctions evasion. "We are seeking to strengthen sanctions and to make sure we address violations of sanctions," she said.
The effectiveness of sanctions on Russia continues to be a subject of intense debate, as recent forecasts from the International Monetary Fund suggested that its economy was performing better than expected.
But Ms. Yellen offered a dark assessment of Russia's economy, arguing that sanctions imposed by the United States and other Western nations were working to isolate the Kremlin, drain the country of talent and sap its productive capacity. Still, the United States continues to view the conflict as the biggest threat to the global economy, and Ms. Yellen made clear that the Biden administration is prepared to continue punishing Russia for its incursion.
Ms. Yellen said that the United States planned to unveil additional sanctions on Russia and that it was working with its allies to devise ways to tighten restrictions already in place.
"We will stand with Ukraine in its fight -- for as long as it takes," Ms. Yellen said at a news conference as finance ministers from the Group of 20 nations, which include Russia and China, convened for two days of meetings.
The Treasury secretary said that the United States had already provided more than $ 46 billion in security, economic and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and that another $ 10 billion in economic support would be delivered in the coming months. Ms. Yellen also called on the I.M.F. to "move swiftly" with a fully financed loan package for Ukraine. The I.M.F. last year approved more than $ 1 billion in emergency financing to Ukraine to mitigate the economic impact of the war.
"Continued, robust support for Ukraine will be a major topic of discussion during my time here in India," Ms. Yellen said.
The United States hopes to include a condemnation of Russia's actions in Ukraine in the joint statement, or communiqué, that the finance ministers are set to release this week. However, it is not clear if a decisive statement will be possible because Russia is a member of the Group of 20 and India, which is hosting the event, continues to buy large quantities of Russian oil.
Despite the urgency to address the crisis in Ukraine, Ms. Yellen offered an upbeat assessment of the global economy, which has begun to recover. While she acknowledged that headwinds remained, she said the world was on more stable footing than last fall, when many were forecasting a global recession.
"It's fair to say that the global economy is in a better place today than many predicted just a few months ago," Ms. Yellen said, pointing to a recent global growth upgrade from the I.M.F.
She added that the United States economy was proving to be resilient, with inflation moderating while the labor market remains strong.
During their meetings on Friday and Saturday, finance ministers are also expected to discuss ways to alleviate the debt crises facing many developing countries. Officials are also expected to put pressure on China, which has become one of the world's largest creditors, to demonstrate more willingness to let more countries restructure their debt.
"I will continue to push for all bilateral official creditors, including China, to participate in meaningful debt treatments for developing countries and emerging markets in distress," Ms. Yellen said.
It was unclear if she would have any meetings with Chinese officials this week. She said that keeping lines of communication open about macroeconomic issues remained important.
"I certainly expect that we will resume discussions," Ms. Yellen said, adding, "I don't have a specific time frame in mind, but I think it's important to do so."

LONDON — Brexit destroyed the careers of two recent British prime ministers, so resolving one of its most poisonous legacies was never going to be easy for the latest, Rishi Sunak.
Predictably enough, things are not going to plan.
Throughout Britain’s tortuous exit from the European Union, successive prime ministers have sought to broker a deal with the bloc over a festering dispute: trade rules for Northern Ireland, where treatment of the border with Ireland, an EU member, has bedeviled negotiators for years.
An agreement was expected this week, until leaks of its contents prompted a backlash from Northern Irish politicians and some of Sunak’s own lawmakers.
The question now is whether Sunak will push ahead with the deal, knowing that it could destabilize his leadership, providing a harsh reminder of the difficulties of solving one of the most intractable consequences of Brexit.
All of his predecessors since 2016 have had to wrestle with Brexit, and the issue cost two, David Cameron and Theresa May, their jobs as prime minister.
“It would be a massive gamble. It would be a gamble on the fate of his prime ministership,” said Anand Menon, a professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King’s College London. “And it’s a gamble he has made without thinking about the odds or trying to stack the cards.”
Even a modest internal rift would be another setback for a prime minister criticized over his party’s poor poll ratings, the country’s stagnant economy and the worst labor unrest in recent memory.

Full text: A maternal preference for sons in a group of killer whales that swim off the Pacific Northwest may contribute to its endangered status.
A fully grown male orca is one of the planet's fiercest hunters. He's a wily, streamlined torpedo who can weigh as much as 11 tons. No other animal preys on him. Yet in at least one population, these apex predators struggle to survive without their moms, who catch their food and even cut it up for them.
Scientists have previously seen that some killer whale mothers share food with their grown sons. In a study published Wednesday in Current Biology, researchers found that this prolonged feeding carries a huge reproductive cost for mothers.
Killer whales, actually the largest members of the dolphin family, swim throughout the world's oceans. Yet they live in discrete populations with their own territories, dialects and hunting customs. A group that spends much of the year off the coast of British Columbia, Washington and Oregon is known as the southern residents. They eat mainly Chinook salmon, which have been increasingly hard to find.
"Killer whales worldwide are doing fine," said Michael Weiss, research director at the Center for Whale Research in Friday Harbor, Wash. But the southern residents, with a population of just 73, are considered endangered.
These whales stay with their birth family for their whole lives. The families are led by matriarchs who can live 80 to 90 years. Yet the females stop reproducing in midlife: Orcas and a few other whale species are the only mammals, besides humans, known to undergo menopause.
To try to explain menopause, scientists have looked for ways that matriarchs encourage the survival of their children and grandchildren. A 2012 study of southern resident killer whales, along with their neighbors, the northern residents, showed that the presence of older moms helped adult offspring stay alive -- especially sons. Males over age 30 were eight times more likely to die in the year following their own mothers' deaths.
One likely factor is that their moms feed them. After a female dives to catch a salmon, Dr. Weiss said, she surfaces with the fish sideways in her mouth. Another whale, often her son, may lurk over her shoulder. "She'll basically jerk her head and bite down really hard, and half of the fish will float back behind her," Dr. Weiss said, to her waiting kid. This feeding continues throughout the son's life.
An adult male may be simply too bulky to easily chase a fleeing salmon, Dr. Weiss said. The whale's more petite mom "not only is probably better at catching the fish but probably better at finding it," he said, thanks to her years of experience. "We think that's a big part of what's keeping these males alive."
To learn what it costs mothers to feed their enormous sons indefinitely, Dr. Weiss and his colleagues looked at nearly four decades' worth of census data on mothers of reproductive age and their families.
Those simple statistics told a dramatic story. Mothers with a living son were about half as likely to reproduce each year, compared with mothers with a daughter or with no offspring. "The effect here is huge," Dr. Weiss said.
"I think this is a really useful piece of the puzzle," said John Ford, a research scientist emeritus who has studied the southern and northern residents at the Pacific Biological Station in Canada.
Dr. Ford said that while a female in one of these populations might have four or five offspring in her life, a male has the potential to father 20 calves or more. Even before she reaches menopause, a mother may have the most evolutionary success by investing in her sons rather than in her daughters -- or herself.
But what worked best historically might not be helping the orcas today. "This strategy evolved under conditions where they had more food available," Dr. Weiss said. Better-fed mothers might not have paid as high a price for sharing their meals. As southern residents face a shortage of salmon, along with other threats, their dwindling population might be even more precarious because mothers sacrifice their own reproduction as they feed their sons.
Dr. Weiss said this strategy represents a new answer to a basic evolutionary question: When should a parent cut off their young? "What hasn't been found until now, as far as we are aware, is a case where the answer to that question is: Never," he said. "You don't stop."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In this wry Finnish drama, a disabled man embarks on a journey to visit his girlfriend, encountering inaccessible infrastructure and evil goons along the way.
The opening scenes of Teemu Nikki's film tell us two things about its protagonist, Jaakko (Petri Poikolainen): first, that he's a cinephile who can't get through a single conversation without referencing John Carpenter; second, that he is blind and uses a wheelchair.
"The Blind Man Who Did Not Want to See Titanic" is a darkly comic drama about how Jaakko navigates life as a disabled man in Finland, yet his disability isn't his defining characteristic. His wry judgments on movies are probably what you'll remember most vividly about him, including his description of James Cameron's "Titanic" as "the most expensive and calculated turd ever."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Jaakko may pretend he's above sap, but he's a romantic at heart. His daily phone conversations with his long-distance girlfriend, Sirpa (Marjaana Maijala), are as tender as they are witty, and when Sirpa's cancer worsens, Jaakko embarks on a journey befitting a Hollywood caper: He sets off to visit her on his own, fumbling his way from taxi to train through a dispiritingly inaccessible urban landscape.
Like his character, Poikolainen has multiple sclerosis, which has caused vision loss and partial paralysis. Nikki places us squarely within his perspective: The camera stays close to Jaakko, always at his eye level, blurring everything around him. But the script struggles to channel the character's wonderfully playful, acerbic spirit.
The obstacles Jaakko encounters range from banally outrageous (malfunctioning elevators at train stations) to cinematically outrageous (evil, goofy muggers wielding knives). Jaakko can't help referencing "Fargo" even as he's being threatened, but rather than follow that cue and dial up the whimsy, the plot eventually thins out into dissatisfying contrivances. Jaakko deserves better -- and the charming, arresting Poikolainen does, too.

Long Covid Said to Sap Work Force: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: An analysis of workers' compensation claims in New York found that 71 percent of claimants with long Covid needed continuing medical treatment or were unable to work for six months or more.
Long Covid is having a significant effect on America's work force, preventing substantial numbers of people from going back to work while others continue needing medical care long after returning to their jobs, according to a new analysis of workers' compensation claims in New York State.
The study, published Tuesday by New York's largest workers' compensation insurer, found that during the first two years of the pandemic, about 71 percent of people the fund classified as experiencing long Covid either required continuing medical treatment or were unable to work for six months or more. More than a year after contracting the coronavirus, 18 percent of long Covid patients had still not returned to work, more than three-fourths of them younger than 60, the analysis found.
"Long Covid has harmed the work force," said the report, by the New York State Insurance Fund, a state agency financed by employer-paid premiums. The findings, it added, "highlight long Covid as an underappreciated yet important reason for the many unfilled jobs and declining labor participation rate in the economy, and they presage a possible reduction in productivity as employers feel the strains of an increasingly sick work force."
The report, which analyzed Covid-related claims from patients exposed to the virus at work, filed between Jan. 1, 2020, and March 31, 2022, and paid by the agency, provides a snapshot of the problem. The agency, one of the 10 largest workers' compensation insurers in the country, found that nearly a third of 3,139 Covid-related claims it paid met its definition of long Covid.
Patients received coverage from the fund if they had a positive coronavirus test and the agency or a workers' compensation board determined that they had a high risk of having been exposed to the virus while at work, typically in environments like hospitals, grocery stores or transit systems. The report classified a case as long Covid if, after infection, a patient required medical treatment for 60 days or more or lost 60 or more days of work.
"It's a pretty conservative estimate," said Gaurav Vasisht, executive director and chief executive officer of the insurance fund. "It's not capturing people who may have gone back to work and didn't seek medical attention and may still be suffering, so you know, they're just toughing it out."
During the time frame of the report, claims for the 977 people the fund designated as having long Covid cost about $ 17 million out of the approximately $ 20 million paid to all Covid patients, officials said, adding that the proportion for lost wages was slightly greater than for medical treatment. But Mr. Vasisht cautioned that the dollar amounts provided only a partial picture because it was unclear how long people would need medical care or time off for long Covid.
He added that the cost to patients went beyond money. "The longer you're out of work, the harder it is for you to get back to work, and that can stigmatize patients," Mr. Vasisht said. "It could be highly disruptive to their family and professional lives."
Long Covid is defined by public health authorities as a constellation of symptoms that linger after the initial infection or that emerge weeks later and can include breathing problems, fatigue and brain fog. The Government Accountability Office estimated that long Covid has affected 7.7 million to 23 million people in the United States.
Katie Bach, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who was not involved in the report, said the study showed that "we have a group of people who got long Covid and at least up until now have been unable to get back to work, and it is a nontrivial number of people."
She said the report reflects only a slice of the work force: employees with workplace exposure to the virus who are knowledgeable enough about workers' compensation to file claims. It might include employees who are younger or sicker than the overall working population, while also missing other workers with long Covid, said Ms. Bach, whose own research suggests that about 500,000 people in the United States are currently not working because of long Covid.
The New York report also found some optimistic signals. Since the pandemic's first wave in early 2020, long Covid cases decreased as a percentage of workers' compensations claims and of Covid-related claims. The decrease coincided with the advent of vaccines, which studies suggest reduce the risk of long Covid, and with new coronavirus treatments, supporting the idea that if people can avoid becoming severely ill from their initial infection, they are less likely to experience long-term symptoms.
Still, Mr. Vasisht said the agency continued to receive claims for workers with long Covid, especially after surges in infections. The report also suggested that more employees than reflected in the data might have met the criteria for long Covid claims. The vast majority of all Covid-related claims, over 83 percent, were filed by essential workers -- in occupations like health care, law enforcement and security services. But only 29 percent of their claims met the definition for long Covid, while 44 percent of nonessential workers met that definition.
That could be because "essential workers might not have been able to stay home from work beyond the required quarantine period," the report said. And health care workers might have "self-treated their symptoms" rather than seeking medical care, the report said, adding "essential workers may have long Covid rates higher than the data suggests, creating a blind spot for policymakers."
"A lot of people can't afford to not work and so they're working when they really shouldn't be, continuing to work while they're sick," said Ms. Bach. She said that the experience of people with similar post-viral conditions like myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic fatigue syndrome suggests that some people who work despite their long Covid may have harder recoveries. "When people who have a condition whose hallmark symptoms are fatigue and brain fog go into work, they're not going to be as productive and they're probably reducing their odds of improvement," she said.
And because 40 percent of claimants with long Covid returned to work within 60 days of becoming infected while still receiving medical treatment, Mr. Vasisht said, employers might receive "more requests for reduced hours or other accommodations."
The study also found that doctors used a specific long Covid diagnostic code in only 30 cases, even though the code was added to the International Classification of Diseases in October 2021. "Physicians are underutilizing the I.C.D. code," said Mr. Vasisht, adding that he believed his organization "can do a lot of good by conducting outreach to the physician community and letting them know about the research on long Covid and also about the existence of this I.C.D. code."
Other findings were consistent with previously identified long Covid patterns, including results of two 2022 studies that analyzed different workers' compensation data sets. The most common long Covid symptoms included shortness of breath, fatigue, weakness, and cognitive and memory problems.
Women appeared to be at greater risk than men, as were people who became sick enough from their initial infection to be hospitalized and those with previous conditions like lung disease, hypertension, obesity and depression. Adults older than 60 were less likely to resume working than younger employees, which might indicate that some long Covid patients are retiring early, adding to labor shortages, Ms. Bach said.
Overall, said David Cutler, an economics professor at Harvard who has researched the cost of long Covid and was not involved in the study, "the report shows that even if Covid deaths are down, Covid is not over, and it won't be for some time."

Fruitless Leak Inquiry Heightens Air of Distrust in Supreme Court: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An investigation of the abortion opinion leak was meant to right the institution amid a slide in public confidence. Instead, employees say, it deepened suspicions and caused disillusionment.
Last spring and summer, employees of the Supreme Court were drawn into an investigation that turned into an uncomfortable awakening.
As the court marshal's office looked into who had leaked the draft opinion of the decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion, law clerks who had secured coveted perches at the top of the judiciary scrambled for legal advice and navigated quandaries like whether to surrender their personal cellphones to investigators.
The "court family" soon realized that its sloppy security might make it impossible to ever identify the culprit: 82 people, in addition to the justices, had access to the draft opinion. "Burn bags" holding sensitive documents headed for destruction sat around for days. Internal doors swung open with numerical codes that were shared widely and went unchanged for months.
Perhaps most painful, some employees found themselves questioning the integrity of the institution they had pledged to serve, according to interviews with almost two dozen current and former employees, former law clerks, advisers to last year's clerkship class and others close to them, who provided previously undisclosed details about the investigation.
Inside the court, justices are treated with such day-to-day deference that junior aides assist them in putting on their black robes. As staff members were grilled, some grew concerned about the fairness of the inquiry, worried that the nine most powerful people at the court were not being questioned rigorously like everyone else.
The investigation was an attempt by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. to right the institution and its image after a grievous breach and slide in public trust. Instead, it may have lowered confidence inside the court and out.
On Thursday, the court issued a 20-page report disclosing that the marshal's monthslong search for the leaker had been fruitless, and detailing embarrassing gaps in internal policies and security. While noting that 97 workers had been formally interviewed, the report did not say whether the justices or their spouses had been.
Public reaction was scathing: "Not even a sentence explaining why they were or weren't questioned," tweeted Sean Davis, co-founder of The Federalist, a conservative magazine.
A day later, the court was forced to issue a second statement saying that the marshal had in fact conferred with the justices, but on very different terms from others at the institution. Lower-level employees had been formally interrogated, recorded, pressed to sign affidavits denying any involvement and warned that they could lose their jobs if they failed to answer questions fully, according to interviews and the report.
In contrast, conversations with the justices had been a two-way "iterative process" in which they asked as well as answered questions, the marshal, Gail A. Curley, wrote. She had seen no need for them to sign affidavits, she said.
Instead of putting the matter to rest, Friday's statement heightened concerns about a double standard for justices.
"They weren't subjected to the same level of scrutiny," said one court worker on Friday, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the court's confidentiality rules. "It's hard to imagine any of them suffering meaningful consequences even if they were implicated in the leak."
Internal examinations can build or sap an organization's authority, said Glenn Fine, a former inspector general for the Justice Department who has conducted such inquiries, and more recently, has argued that the court needs a similar figure.
"Leak investigations are a double-edged sword," Mr. Fine said in an interview. A thorough investigation can be a deterrent, but "an investigation that doesn't solve a leak may embolden more leakers in the future."
Failing to fully scrutinize the justices "just completely undermines the court's credibility," said Mark S. Zaid, a lawyer who often handles government investigations. "It sends a message of superiority that does not exist under the eyes of the law."
Besides, "justices have a long history of being the ultimate source of leaks," Aaron Tang, a law professor and former clerk to Justice Sonia Sotomayor, wrote in an Opinion essay in The New York Times.
In interviews, some employees said the leak and investigation further tainted the atmosphere inside a court that had already grown tense with disagreement. The leak spurred finger pointing, they said, with many conservatives convinced that a liberal had engineered the breach and vice versa. Just as the justices have grown more divided, so has their staff, eroding trust. Voices are more hushed now, the employees said, and doors that used to be open are closed.
Interrogating the Staff
In December 2021, after an early vote by the justices, word of the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization began to circulate in the court. The new conservative supermajority was about to overturn Roe v. Wade, removing a right in force for nearly a half-century. Wrenching for some on the staff and welcome for others, the outcome would have to be closely guarded by the court for six months.
In February, the draft opinion was emailed to a list of 70 clerks and employees; it eventually was seen by a dozen more, the report said. Some employees discussed the results with confidants in the building, and a few later admitted that they told their spouses, according to the report.
But the publication of the full draft opinion in Politico on May 2 was a shock felt almost physically at the court: Protesters roared outside the building, so loud they could be heard from some bathrooms. Over the years, information had occasionally dribbled out about pending decisions. But the court's opinion was not yet final, and the leak seemed calculated to interfere with deliberations: "a grave assault on the judicial process," as the marshal's report would put it.
By the time the chief justice summoned the three dozen clerks for a mandatory meeting about the breach, many of the pedigreed young lawyers were already worried. On the internet, accusers on the right were attacking the liberal justices' clerks, posting names and photos and wild whodunit theories. One clerk had been quoted in a Politico article years before. Another had a master's degree in gender studies, had written about reproductive rights and was married to a reporter. The tweets went viral, with tens of thousands of likes. (Later, the court's investigators found "nothing to substantiate" those accusations.)
The chief had assigned the investigation to Ms. Curley, the marshal, whose best-known task was crying "Oyez, oyez, oyez!" as justices entered the courtroom. She was a respected former Army lawyer, but her division had little of the investigative muscle of other government agencies, no subpoena power and a staff only partly devoted to security. Others on her team dealt with court administrative tasks like staffing events and handling mail.
But Chief Justice Roberts was a staunch defender of the court's independence, reluctant to let outsiders interfere. "The Judiciary's power to manage its internal affairs," he had written months before, "insulates courts from inappropriate political influence and is crucial to preserving public trust in its work as a separate and co-equal branch of government."
As interviews of clerks began, a dilemma emerged. No one wanted to seem uncooperative, as if they had something to hide. The court's written code of conduct states that the justices "expect and require complete loyalty from their own law clerks and the clerks of all other Justices." Rifts between a clerk and his or her justice could have immediate and lasting implications, according to interviews with those who have held the one-year positions as well as advisers to last year's class. The job rested on intimacy with justices, the ability to channel the bosses' voices and views in drafting opinions.
The advantages accrued in one year at the court can compound for decades. For those who move on to law firms, the signing bonuses can be as high as $ 450,000, according to several lawyers at firms that recruit and hire them. The justices have powerful alumni networks that include reunions. A justice's endorsement can be decisive for a federal judgeship or a law professor post. Many clerks join appellate practices, where, after a mandatory short break from court business, they spend the rest of their careers being paid handsomely to read and influence the justices' minds.
But the marshal's search was broad. The interview questions, and the affidavits the clerks were asked to sign, were sweeping, and lying to federal investigators was a crime. Investigators collected the clerks' court-issued electronic devices and requested their personal ones. The group feared what one person called "spillage" -- outed details, like stray comments about justices or cases, that had nothing to do with the leak but could prove damaging.
The request to hand over personal cellphones caused some to seek legal counsel. It is unclear the degree to which clerks agreed to share the physical devices. But the report said that employees "voluntarily provided call and text detail records and billing statements," suggesting that at least some may have reached a compromise: Investigators could view records and numbers but did not have access to other personal material.
The Inquiry Expands, and Deflates
In June and July, the inquiry proceeded to other workers, few of whom had the connections or potential earning power of the clerks. Some were long-serving employees who had protected the court's secrets for years; others were just out of college.
As they sat for interviews, a stenographer and an audio technician captured every word. Some conversations were short and cursory, according to some who were questioned; others were far more detailed. A few employees were brought back for repeat interrogations, according to the report. The marshal's office interviewed almost 100 workers in all, the report noted. Even the marshal's aides, junior employees who have limited access to draft opinions, were questioned.
In the course of the investigation, the marshal's office and other employees realized just how lax the court's rules and protections had been. The question of whether court material could be brought home was fuzzy. Though employees weren't supposed to tell anyone about the justices' decisions, some told their spouses. For all its majesty, the Supreme Court is a porous and somewhat antiquated organization, lacking the armor of other government bodies that handle sensitive information.
In a May 2022 speech, Justice Clarence Thomas described how the leak had changed the atmosphere at the court. "You begin to look over your shoulder," he said. "It's like kind of an infidelity. You can explain it, but you can't undo it."
But in interviews, employees raised questions about whether the justices themselves have contributed to a decline in trust inside and outside the court.
Periodically, employees receive a stern memo reminding them that they may not participate in partisan political activities -- no events, fund-raising, bumper stickers or statements on social media. So some bristled when four justices attended a 40th-anniversary dinner for the Federalist Society, an influential conservative group that focuses on the judiciary, in November.
Last spring, Justice Thomas declined to recuse himself from cases involving attempts to overthrow the 2020 election, even though Virginia Thomas, his wife, had been involved in those efforts. Months later, a former leader of the anti-abortion movement wrote to the chief justice to report an alleged earlier breach, of a 2014 contraception decision, that he said stemmed from a donor's meal with Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. and his wife. The court never responded.
In recent months, as the court has completed its report, new clerks have taken their places inside the chambers. Security is tightening. Further protocol changes are promised. And with the release of the report, a growing recognition has taken hold, some employees say: The best chance of understanding who leaked the most consequential decision in generations, and what that person was trying to achieve, is fading away.

Last spring and summer, employees of the Supreme Court were drawn into an investigation that turned into an uncomfortable awakening.
As the court marshal’s office looked into who had leaked the draft opinion of the decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion, law clerks who had secured coveted perches at the top of the judiciary scrambled for legal advice and navigated quandaries including whether to surrender their personal cellphones to investigators.
The “court family” soon realized that its sloppy security might make it impossible to ever identify the culprit: 82 people, in addition to the justices, had access to the draft opinion. “Burn bags” holding sensitive documents headed for destruction sat around for days. Internal doors swung open with numerical codes that were shared widely and went unchanged for months.
Perhaps most painful, some employees found themselves questioning the integrity of the institution they had pledged to serve, according to interviews with almost two dozen current and former employees, former law clerks, advisers to last year’s clerkship class and others close to them, who provided previously undisclosed details about the investigation.
Inside the court, justices are treated with such day-to-day deference that junior aides assist them in putting on their black robes. As staff members were grilled, some grew concerned about the fairness of the inquiry, worried that the nine most powerful people at the court were not being questioned rigorously like everyone else.
The investigation was an attempt by Chief Justice John Roberts to right the institution and its image after a grievous breach and slide in public trust. Instead, it may have lowered confidence inside the court and out.
On Thursday, the court issued a 20-page report disclosing that the marshal’s monthslong search for the leaker had been fruitless, and detailing embarrassing gaps in internal policies and security. While noting that 97 workers had been formally interviewed, the report did not say whether the justices or their spouses had been.
Public reaction was scathing: “Not even a sentence explaining why they were or weren’t questioned,” tweeted Sean Davis, co-founder of The Federalist, a conservative magazine.
A day later, the court was forced to issue a second statement saying that the marshal had in fact conferred with the justices, but on very different terms from others at the institution. Lower-level employees had been formally interrogated, recorded, pressed to sign affidavits denying any involvement and warned that they could lose their jobs if they failed to answer questions fully, according to interviews and the report.
In contrast, conversations with the justices had been a two-way “iterative process” in which they asked as well as answered questions, the marshal, Gail Curley, wrote. She had seen no need for them to sign affidavits, she said.
Instead of putting the matter to rest, Friday’s statement heightened concerns about a double standard for justices.
“They weren’t subjected to the same level of scrutiny,” said one court worker on Friday, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the court’s confidentiality rules. “It’s hard to imagine any of them suffering meaningful consequences even if they were implicated in the leak.”
Internal examinations can build or sap an organization’s authority, said Glenn Fine, a former inspector general for the Justice Department who has conducted such inquiries, and more recently, has argued that the court needs a similar figure.
“Leak investigations are a double-edged sword,” Fine said in an interview. A thorough investigation can be a deterrent, but “an investigation that doesn’t solve a leak may embolden more leakers in the future.”
Failing to fully scrutinize the justices “just completely undermines the court’s credibility,” said Mark Zaid, a lawyer who often handles government investigations. “It sends a message of superiority that does not exist under the eyes of the law.”
Besides, “justices have a long history of being the ultimate source of leaks,” Aaron Tang, a law professor and former clerk to Justice Sonia Sotomayor, wrote in an Opinion essay in The New York Times.
In interviews, some employees said the leak and investigation further tainted the atmosphere inside a court that had already grown tense with disagreement. The leak spurred finger pointing, they said, with many conservatives convinced that a liberal had engineered the breach and vice versa. Just as the justices have grown more divided, so has their staff, eroding trust. Voices are more hushed now, the employees said, and doors that used to be open are closed.
Interrogating the Staff
In December 2021, after an early vote by the justices, word of the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization began to circulate in the court. The new conservative supermajority was about to overturn Roe v. Wade, removing a right in force for nearly a half-century. Wrenching for some on the staff and welcome for others, the outcome would have to be closely guarded by the court for six months.
In February, the draft opinion was emailed to a list of 70 clerks and employees; it eventually was seen by a dozen more, the report said. Some employees discussed the results with confidants in the building, and a few later admitted that they told their spouses, according to the report.
But the publication of the full draft opinion in Politico on May 2 was a shock felt almost physically at the court: Protesters roared outside the building, so loud they could be heard from some bathrooms. Over the years, information had occasionally dribbled out about pending decisions. But the court’s opinion was not yet final, and the leak seemed calculated to interfere with deliberations: “a grave assault on the judicial process,” as the marshal’s report would put it.
By the time the chief justice summoned the three dozen clerks for a mandatory meeting about the breach, many of the pedigreed young lawyers were worried. On the internet, accusers on the right were attacking the liberal justices’ clerks, posting names and photos and wild whodunit theories. One clerk had been quoted in a Politico article years before. Another had a master’s degree in gender studies, had written about reproductive rights and was married to a reporter. The tweets went viral, with tens of thousands of likes. (Later the court’s investigators found “nothing to substantiate” those accusations.)
The chief had assigned the investigation to Curley, the marshal, whose best-known task was crying “Oyez, oyez, oyez!” as justices entered the courtroom. She was a respected former Army lawyer, but her division had little of the investigative muscle of other government agencies, no subpoena power and a staff only partly devoted to security. Others on her team dealt with court administrative tasks such as staffing events and handling mail.
But Roberts was a staunch defender of the court’s independence, reluctant to let outsiders interfere. “The Judiciary’s power to manage its internal affairs,” he had written months before, “insulates courts from inappropriate political influence and is crucial to preserving public trust in its work as a separate and co-equal branch of government.”
As interviews of clerks began, a dilemma emerged. No one wanted to seem uncooperative, as if they had something to hide. The court’s written code of conduct states that the justices “expect and require complete loyalty from their own law clerks and the clerks of all other Justices.” Rifts between a clerk and his or her justice could have immediate and lasting implications, according to interviews with those who have held the one-year positions as well as advisers to last year’s class. The job rested on intimacy with justices, the ability to channel the bosses’ voices and views in drafting opinions.
The advantages accrued in one year at the court can compound for decades. For those who move on to law firms, the signing bonuses can be as high as $450,000, according to several lawyers at firms that recruit and hire them. The justices have powerful alumni networks that include reunions. A justice’s endorsement can be decisive for a federal judgeship or a law professor post. Many clerks join appellate practices, where, after a mandatory short break from court business, they spend the rest of their careers being paid handsomely to read and influence the justices’ minds.
But the marshal’s search was broad. The interview questions, and the affidavits the clerks were asked to sign, were sweeping, and lying to federal investigators was a crime. Investigators collected the clerks’ court-issued electronic devices and requested their personal ones. The group feared what one person called “spillage” — outed details, such as stray comments about justices or cases, that had nothing to do with the leak but could prove damaging.
The request to hand over personal cellphones caused some to seek legal counsel. It is unclear the degree to which clerks agreed to share the physical devices. But the report said that employees “voluntarily provided call and text detail records and billing statements,” suggesting that at least some may have reached a compromise: Investigators could view records and numbers but did not have access to other personal material.
The Inquiry Expands, and Deflates
In June and July, the inquiry proceeded to other workers, few of whom had the connections or potential earning power of the clerks. Some were long-serving employees who had protected the court’s secrets for years; others were just out of college.
As they sat for interviews, a stenographer and an audio technician captured every word. Some conversations were short and cursory, according to some who were questioned; others were far more detailed. A few employees were brought back for repeat interrogations, according to the report. The marshal’s office interviewed almost 100 workers in all, the report noted. Even the marshal’s aides, junior employees who have limited access to draft opinions, were questioned.
In the course of the investigation, the marshal’s office and other employees realized just how lax the court’s rules and protections had been. The question of whether court material could be brought home was fuzzy. Though employees weren’t supposed to tell anyone about the justices’ decisions, some told their spouses. For all its majesty, the Supreme Court is a porous and somewhat antiquated organization, lacking the armor of other government bodies that handle sensitive information.
In a May 2022 speech, Justice Clarence Thomas described how the leak had changed the atmosphere at the court. “You begin to look over your shoulder,” he said. “It’s like kind of an infidelity. You can explain it, but you can’t undo it.”
But in interviews, employees raised questions about whether the justices themselves have contributed to a decline in trust inside and outside the court.
Periodically, employees receive a stern memo reminding them that they may not participate in partisan political activities — no events, fundraising, bumper stickers or statements on social media. So some bristled when four justices attended a 40th anniversary dinner for the Federalist Society, an influential conservative group that focuses on the judiciary, in November.
Last spring, Thomas declined to recuse himself from cases involving attempts to overthrow the 2020 election, even though Virginia Thomas, his wife, had been involved in those efforts. Months later, a former leader of the anti-abortion movement wrote to the chief justice to report an alleged earlier breach, of a 2014 contraception decision, that he said stemmed from a donor’s meal with Justice Samuel Alito and his wife. The court never responded.
In recent months, as the court has completed its report, new clerks have taken their places in the chambers. Security is tightening. Further protocol changes are promised. And with the release of the report, a growing recognition has taken hold, some employees say: The best chance of understanding who leaked the most consequential decision in generations, and what that person was trying to achieve, is fading away.

In Davos, a Skirmish Over the Role Oil States Play in Climate Talks: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: John Kerry defended the choice of an oil executive to run the next climate talks while Greta Thunberg and others raised an alarm.
DAVOS, Switzerland -- John Kerry on Thursday offered a full-throated defense of the decision to hold this year's United Nations climate talks in the United Arab Emirates, one of the world's largest oil producers, suggesting the Gulf state was rapidly transitioning away from fossil fuels and would not compromise the integrity of the negotiations.
"Don't judge a book by its cover," Mr. Kerry, President Biden's special climate envoy, said in an interview on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum.
The United Arab Emirates, selected by the United Nations to host the November talks, has faced withering criticism from climate activists over its selection of Sultan Al Jaber, the head of its national oil company, to oversee the climate talks.
Mr. Kerry has worked closely with Mr. Al Jaber for years and called him a "good friend," adding that he believed the oil executive "would be a very serious and focused interlocutor on this."
He added that the United Arab Emirates, a major strategic ally of the United States, was moving rapidly to embrace renewable energy and reduce its planet-warming emissions in agriculture and other areas.
"There's an advantage to having a petrostate that is actually in the forefront of some of these cutting edge initiatives," Mr. Kerry said. "I think the U.A.E. is serious about it."
Hours after Mr. Kerry spoke, Greta Thunberg, the Swedish climate activist, appeared in Davos and assailed the choice.
"Lobbyists have been influencing these conferences since basically forever and this puts a very clear face to it," she said at a news conference, wearing the muddy boots she had on when she was detained by the police while protesting a coal mine in Germany on Tuesday. "It's completely ridiculous."
Ms. Thunberg was joined by three other young female climate activists, Helena Gualinga of Ecuador, Vanessa Nakate of Uganda and Luisa Neubauer of Germany. The four have launched an online petition demanding that energy companies stop new oil, gas and coal projects.
Ms. Gualinga dismissed the idea that substantive negotiations over climate action could occur in the United Arab Emirates. "There's a huge conflict of interest there," she said. "It sends this message of not taking it seriously."
The climate protesters were joined at the news conference by Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency. Mr. Birol called for a rapid winding down of fossil fuels.
Former Vice President Al Gore, speaking at the main Davos conference and at side events, also lent his support to the activists.
"The appearance of a conflict of interest undermines confidence at a time when climate activists around the world, and I'm partly speaking for them right here on this stage, have come to the conclusion that the people in authority are not doing their job," a fiery Mr. Gore said in a panel discussion on Wednesday. "There's a lot of 'blah blah blah,' as Greta says, there are a lot of words, and there are some meaningful commitments. But we are still failing badly."
"We cannot let the oil companies and gas companies and petrostates tell us what is permissible," Mr. Gore added.
At last year's United Nations climate talks, known as COP27 and held in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, representatives from Saudi Arabia blocked language in the final agreement that would have called for a phasing out of fossil fuels.
Jo Sheldon, a spokeswoman for COP28, the talks scheduled for November, said Mr. Al Jaber was "an energy expert and founder of one of the world's leading renewable energy companies, a senior business leader, government minister and climate diplomat with more than 20 years of experience of taking climate action."
"He is uniquely qualified to deliver a successful COP28," Ms. Sheldon said. "He is determined to make COP28 a COP for all. And to make truly transformational progress it is critical that all stakeholders are at the table."
With the Russian war against Ukraine creating an energy crisis that has had the short-term effect of spurring more fossil fuel production, greenhouse gas emissions have reached a record high, even as solar, wind and other renewable sources are growing.
On Wednesday, the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, issued a stern warning to the crowd gathered at Davos.
"We are flirting with climate disaster," Mr. Guterres said. "Every week brings a new climate horror story. Greenhouse gas emissions are at record levels."
Mr. Guterres added that the consequences of runaway warming "will be devastating" and that "several parts of our planet will be uninhabitable. And for many, this is a death sentence."
Meanwhile, business leaders sought to highlight their companies' eco-friendly bona fides.
On the main street of Davos, an Alpine resort town transformed into a giant trade show for the week, multinational corporations plastered idealistic slogans on storefronts they had transformed into temporary offices.
A Salesforce billboard featuring a smiling brown bear proclaimed that "Business is the greatest platform for change." Uber advertised that it was offering "All-electric Uber Green rides" all week in Davos. And the offices of SAP, the technology giant, featured the slogan, "When you put people first, we build a sustainable world together."
The World Economic Forum program featured a heavy dose of panel discussions and other programs addressing climate change and efforts to reduce emissions.
"Climate is top of the agenda," Jason Bordoff, a dean at the Columbia University Climate School said in an interview at the event. "The sense of urgency is not abating, but there is a new sense of realism that the gap between reality and ambition is getting bigger, not smaller. Now we need to make sure that the reality catches up with the ambition, and we need to meet people's energy needs along the way."
Marina Silva, Brazil's minister of environment and climate change, spoke on Tuesday and said that the newly installed government of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was committed to helping stop planetary warming by protecting the Amazon rain forest.
"We are back to the international agenda to talk about climate, to talk about ambitious targets for the climate and biodiversity," Ms. Silva said.
While temperatures remained below freezing for most of the week, an abnormally warm winter has left much of the area with far less snow than usual, a reminder of the changing climate. In Davos, some ski runs were shuttered and the winter sledging run, a popular diversion for overwhelmed conference attendees, was closed for a lack of snow.

Consumer Banking Foray Turns Costly for Goldman: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Goldman Sachs will take a big hit from its ill-fated move into consumer banking, even as its other businesses weaken amid an economic slowdown.
Goldman Sachs is paying for its misbegotten foray into consumer banking.
Six years ago, Wall Street's most elite investment bank made a big pitch to the little guy, rolling out credit cards, high-interest accounts and loans. On Friday, the bank announced that it had lost slightly more than $ 3 billion tied to that business since December 2020.
It's the latest in a mounting pile of woes for Goldman, which is contending with an economic slowdown that has hurt its traditional investment banking business, at the same time that the changes instituted by David M. Solomon, who took over as chief executive in 2018, have caused upheaval inside the bank.
The announcement on Friday followed a major restructuring that Mr. Solomon unveiled in October as part of his efforts to streamline the bank's culture and practices, and to better orient the firm toward a future in which technology is likely to sap the ability of big banks to make money as intermediaries.
The reorganization involved combining one part of its consumer banking business, including its online bank Marcus, with an asset and wealth management unit. A second part of the consumer business -- including a credit card partnership with Apple -- was folded into a newly created unit. Its bread-and-butter investment banking and trading businesses were merged into a third unit.
Goldman's retail banking operation has been foundering for some time, but it's hardly the only challenge facing the bank. For the past few years, Goldman has dealt with uneven earnings and departures of top executives, some of whom were frustrated with Mr. Solomon's leadership style. This week, it let go of 3,200 bankers, its largest round of layoffs since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.
Tony Fratto, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, characterized the job cuts as a mix of slimming down in the face of slowing corporate deal making, a retrenchment in the firm's consumer ambitions and the ordinary culling of low-performing staff.
The fortunes of many Wall Street banks have swung widely in recent years. Big U.S. banks benefited from an easing of restrictions during the Trump administration. And in the early part of the coronavirus pandemic, volatile markets (which help trading) and government bailouts and easy monetary policy (which encouraged consumer spending and corporate activity) enabled many to turn record profits.
The frenzy, which included record deal-making activity in 2020 and 2021, came to a halt last year, largely as a result of the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases.
JPMorgan Chase, the nation's largest bank by assets, reported a better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit on Friday, but said investment banking revenue plunged 57 percent as big companies went into retrenchment mode.
The combination of high interest rates and fast inflation has hit Goldman especially hard because of the slowdown in its most profitable businesses. In sales and trading, Goldman's revenue last quarter shrank roughly twice as fast as that of its peers, according to estimates from Credit Suisse. And the business of advising companies on initial public offerings and mergers tapered off, strangling a big source of revenue for the bank.
Though Goldman maintained its place among peers as the leader in advising companies in 2022, the global revenue it brought in from deals fell to $ 4.2 billion from $ 4.8 billion in 2021 -- a record year for deal-making, according to Dealogic. Its equity capital markets business felt a far bigger sting, bringing in $ 323 million in the United States last year, much less than the $ 2.5 billion it brought in a year earlier.
On Friday, Goldman revised its financial results, going back to 2020. For the first nine months of 2022, the new unit, called platform solutions, lost $ 1.2 billion, with more than half that loss in the third quarter alone, Goldman said in a securities filing. Its main trading and banking businesses made nearly $ 12 billion, while the asset management business eked out a $ 1.3 billion profit.
The bank is likely to provide more details on Tuesday, when it reports fourth-quarter earnings. Analysts project that the bank will report a steep drop in quarterly profit.
Since taking the top job in 2018, Mr. Solomon, 60, has made numerous changes. He has merged fragmentary fiefs inside its asset management division and eliminated antiquated rivalries between different groups of bankers.
With the backing of the bank's board, Mr. Solomon asserted that the changes were Goldman's only way forward in an era when technology threatens to weaken the traditional financial system's hegemony.
His compensation seems to reflect the board's approval. Mr. Solomon's pay rose to $ 39.5 million in 2021, the most recent year for which data is available, from $ 24.7 million in 2019, his first full year on the job. Since his ascension to chief executive, Goldman's stock price is up 65 percent, well ahead of its rivals' average.
Some of Goldman's biggest problems trace to a time before Mr. Solomon was in charge. For instance, the bank's move into consumer banking in 2016, with offerings of high-interest-rate checking accounts and a luxury-oriented credit card, happened under Mr. Solomon's predecessor, Lloyd C. Blankfein. In its early stages, the business ran largely independently of Goldman's operations, and its managers had the freedom to develop its customer base and technology offerings.
But Mr. Solomon's handling of the business has drawn widespread criticism from investors and analysts. Early in his tenure, he merged the fledgling consumer bank with Goldman's private wealth management arm. Suddenly, the oversight of Marcus was shared among many senior executives who previously had no input. Many of Marcus's original managers left.
And then there is Mr. Solomon's leadership style, which has created enough friction among senior employees that it could undermine the success of his strategy, according to seven people who spoke about his approach.
"David has a direct style, but he's running a big, complex business," said Mr. Fratto, the Goldman spokesman. Of employees' criticisms of their boss, he said that it was not unusual to have different views about a chief executive's style, but that Mr. Solomon had shown flexibility. "If a strategy isn't meeting our aspirations, David has shown the ability to adjust and pivot," he said.
Goldman was founded in 1869 and evolved into a partnership not long after. Although it became a public company in 1999, the spirit of partnership and loyalty was a prized feature of Goldman's culture.
More recently, it has dissipated. Since Mr. Solomon started, at least nine senior executives have left the bank, some of them for more lucrative opportunities. And with bonuses shrinking as much as 50 percent across Wall Street as a result of the downturn in trading and investment banking activities, the incentives to remain are fewer.
Mike Mayo, a longtime banking analyst at Wells Fargo, said of Mr. Solomon: "He has a mission, and that mission is not to be the most-liked person at the firm."
Unlike Mr. Blankfein, who took a more genial approach and acted as a guiding force, according to people who worked for him, Mr. Solomon rules with an iron fist. To foster trust, Mr. Blankfein kept the firm going more like a partnership than a top-down organization, often using humor to defuse tense moments and win his employees' loyalty.
Mr. Solomon, by contrast, spurns dissent, appears unwilling to entertain criticism and has been known to yell at meetings, many high-ranking current and former employees said -- a style of management that has fallen especially out of favor after the coronavirus pandemic upended traditional notions of work and work-life balance.
Much of the employee discontent started during the pandemic, when Mr. Solomon was seen as lacking empathy and sensitivity. In July 2020, well before Covid-19 vaccines were available, Mr. Solomon was determined to issue a decree to employees to return to the office, five days a week, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. He had to be talked out of sending a memo mandating such a return, the people said.
Although he abandoned the effort to bring everyone back so early, Mr. Solomon insisted on in-person meetings with senior staff members when the New York State and New York City health guidelines allowed it.
Goldman has since mandated a policy that requires employees to be in the office five days a week. Some of its peers, including Citigroup and Bank of America, have been more flexible.
