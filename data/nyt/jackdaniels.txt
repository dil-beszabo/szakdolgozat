Full text: In some ways, John Malecki can thank a cheap coffee table for his 1.2 million subscribers on YouTube.
Had he owned a sturdier table, maybe he wouldn’t have thought twice about his enthusiasm for HGTV’s home improvement show “Fixer Upper,” which he watched on repeat as a fringe offensive lineman in the NFL.
As it turns out, though, Malecki’s table broke right before his final preseason with his hometown Pittsburgh Steelers in 2013. And as the “Fixer Upper” fan he was, building a new one sounded way better than just buying a replacement.
At that point, Malecki, an undrafted free agent out of Pitt, was on his fifth team in four years. Football had always been his North Star, guiding him in any decision since elementary school.
Now, in his mid-20s, that North Star was dimming.
In between training camp practices, with the help of some Home Depot two-by-fours, Malecki constructed a homemade coffee table for his South Side Pittsburgh apartment. As he reflected on his appreciation for the work Chip and Joanna Gaines did on “Fixer Upper,” he thought, I kind of want to build my own cool things.
In the weeks that followed, and especially after his NFL career ended when he was cut in September that year, he bought some new woodworking tools — the start of what would be a large collection, and a whole new passion.
Today, Malecki’s YouTube subscribers tune in to his woodworking channel to watch him build everything from cutting boards and end tables to a hidden whiskey cabinet and a door inspired by “The Lord of the Rings.”
Like others who pour themselves into their work, Malecki did not view himself as someone who had many interests outside football. When he started building his coffee table, he had no formal training and didn’t know what he was doing; he was just curious and allowed himself to follow that curiosity.
So what happens when we pay a bit more attention to those everyday afterthoughts and give ourselves the freedom to explore new areas of growth?
Passions can be brought out of us at odd times, but most often when we feel an underlying need for change in our lives. For Malecki, that meant creating postfootball opportunities to experiment, fail and develop.
While watching one of his videos now, you might notice a tattoo on Malecki’s arm. He got it after one of his college coaches used to preach the importance of perseverance.
It says: Keep chopping wood.
Two years earlier, Malecki was holed up in an extended stay hotel on Christmas Day, alone except for a bottle of Jack Daniels and a jigsaw puzzle. A member of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers practice squad at the time, Malecki was already on his third team that season. The Bucs played the next day, and the bottle and puzzle filled his time away from home.
Back in Pennsylvania, Malecki’s family was crafting its annual lavish spread: filet roast paired with pasta made from scratch, his grandmother’s homemade gnocchi, his mother’s pumpkin pie.
His mother had sent him a care package that week, trying to replicate the experience.
Still, he said, “I was super bummed.”
And yet he was also living out everything he had always wanted. When he was a 10-year-old growing up in Murrysville, 30 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh, he had placed a piece of paper in a time capsule with his dream written on it: “I’m going to be in the NFL.”
If that meant Christmases alone in a hotel room and away from his family, that was part of the deal.
“At the time I was a firm believer that you have to suffer in order to get what you want in life,” he said.
After that season with the Bucs, he had two more stints with the Steelers sandwiched around a brief stop in Washington. When the Steelers’ head coach, Mike Tomlin, called him into his office in 2013, Malecki’s intuition told him it might be permanent.
“Appreciate your work, John,” Tomlin told him.
His football career was over.
The next spring, Malecki interviewed for a sales job at a metal byproduct company. He hadn’t played in the NFL in months, and what he wanted more than a sales job was another shot in the NFL.
But when the owner of the company told him during the interview, “This is great, John, but you don’t have any experience,” it was like a slap across the face.
“I was useless,” Malecki said. “I had no skills.”
He added: “All my childhood hopes and dreams crumbling. I was just sad. Just lost in multiple facets of life.”
The one thing Malecki continued to do during that time of uncertainty was build new stuff out of wood.
One day, Malecki was hanging out with a former teammate, Baron Batch, who had just bought a house. The lack of furniture was glaring. No table or chairs, just couches.
They were sitting in the empty garage, looking at the workbench in the corner, crowded with random supplies on top of it.
“What if we built stuff?” Malecki asked Batch.
The same excitement Malecki had before he built his apartment coffee table crept in. Soon after, Batch’s house was furnished with homemade tables, cabinets and shelving.
Buying tools off Craigslist, using more Home Depot two-by-fours and an old jointer his father had given him, Malecki started to spend most of his time attempting new builds.
“I was just boozing and hanging out with my buddies,” Malecki said, laughing. “We were curious a lot, and I was trying to figure out that next thing in life.”
He began posting on Facebook and Instagram, showing what he and Batch were doing. He had no expectations of where this could lead. But comments started to roll in:
I would love one.
Could you make me that?
Batch and Malecki decided to open a studio together, called Studio AM, where they combined Batch’s artistic visions with Malecki’s woodworking skills. As time went on, and his Instagram and Facebook following grew, he decided a YouTube presence could help, so he started posting a few videos.
“They are so bad,” Malecki said. “Just awful.”
Then, in 2016, he posted a video of a crosscut sled, a common woodworking tool. It was a basic YouTube post, and he expected the usual mild response. Except it got a couple hundred thousand views. I don’t know how to capitalize on this, but this feels good, he thought.
As he was finding his way, he kept repeating a mantra he used during his football career: “Just do the reps, John. You go to the gym, you hate it, just do the reps. You don’t like this drill, you don’t like this exercise, the coach said do it, you do it.”
Malecki allowed himself the freedom to explore an area he was curious about, gradually letting go of the idea that his only purpose in life was football. But he did keep his sense of purpose, the things he believed in that translated across fields.
“Effort and attitude — those are two of the controllable things you have,” Malecki said. “I took that from football and applied it dramatically to the next phase of my life. You can’t lose if you don’t quit.”
In 2018, Malecki signed a yearlong sponsorship with a company for $65,000, his big financial breakthrough. It was the first time he realized he could actually make a living woodworking. Now, he makes in one month almost what he did in his best year in the NFL.
“We were just taken aback at how creative he was,” Max Starks, a former Steelers teammate, said of Malecki. “We knew he was creative, we knew he was funny, but to combine both of those things and do it so seamlessly and be genuine about it is something that’s kind of fascinating.”
To Ramon Foster, a teammate of Malecki’s with the Steelers, it quickly became apparent what kind of person he was.
“He came to work every day, he took a lot of crap, and he stayed and persevered,” Foster said.
So when Malecki started to sell his creations, Foster wanted to be one of his first big sales. He is now the owner of a customized University of Tennessee cutting board, along with a coffee table, cornhole boards and cutting boards crafted by Malecki.
In return, Foster asks for only one thing.
“I just want to put it out there,” Foster said. “If he ever goes and meets Chip and Joanna Gaines and he doesn’t invite me and my wife, we’re going to have a real problem.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He was the patriarch in one of the first sitcoms with an all-Black cast and an enslaved African in the American South in a blockbuster TV mini-series.
John Amos, who played a stern patriarch on "Good Times," America's first sitcom featuring a two-parent Black family, and who had a starring role in "Roots," the slavery narrative that became America's most watched show in the late 1970s, has died in Los Angeles. He was 84.
His publicist, Belinda Foster, confirmed the death on Tuesday, saying he had died on Aug. 21. She did not specify the cause or say why the announcement of his death was delayed.
Mr. Amos's acting career spanned more than five decades, with his breakthrough coming in 1970 on the CBS comedy "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," playing Gordy, the weatherman on a local television news program working alongside Ms. Moore's Mary Richards, an associate producer. After three seasons, Mr. Amos left for "Good Times," a Norman Lear production and a spinoff of the producer's sitcom "Maude."
Chronicling the trials and tribulations of a Black working-class family living in the Chicago projects, "Good Times," which ran from 1974-79, also on CBS, never shied away from the gritty realities of life in public housing, touching on topics like racial bigotry, drug abuse and poverty -- but all with a sense of humor.
Mr. Amos played James Evans Sr., a fierce disciplinarian with a tender heart who took on odd jobs to support his wife, Florida Evans (Esther Rolle), his sons Michael (Ralph Carter) and J.J. (Jimmie Walker), and his daughter, Thelma (Bern Nadette Stanis).
At one point, reminiscing with a childhood friend about his roots, James recounts how he used to be so poor that while other children had patches on their clothes, he had "patches on my patches!"
"Good Times" accrued high ratings and was lauded for making television history -- it was one of the first sitcoms with an all-Black cast, preceding Mr. Lear's "The Jeffersons" (1975-85). But Ms. Rolle and Mr. Amos felt that there were still inroads to be made by Black members of the production, and they pushed Mr. Lear to allow them to modify the scripts, which had largely been drafted by white writers.
"They'd go on about their credits," Mr. Amos said of the writers in an interview with the SiriusXM program "Sway in the Morning." Then he'd ask them, "'Well, how long have you been Black? That just doesn't happen in the community. We don't think that way. We don't act that way. We don't let our children do that."'
His outspokenness, while at first welcomed, eventually got him fired in 1976 for being a "disruptive element," Mr. Amos said in the radio interview. He was written out of Season 4, killed off in an automobile accident.
"I had a way of voicing my differences with the script that weren't acceptable to the creative staff," Mr. Amos said.
"Roots," a 1977 mini-series based on a semi-autobiographical novel by Alex Haley, is a family saga that begins with Kunta Kinte, a Mandinka teenager from Gambia who is captured there, put in chains on a ship to America and enslaved on a Southern plantation in the 1700s. It then follows his descendants from colonialism to Civil War to Jim Crow, ending with Mr. Haley in modern times.
Mr. Amos was cast as the older version of Kunta Kinte, while LeVar Burton played the younger one. The show racked up 37 Primetime Emmy nominations -- Mr. Amos received one for outstanding lead actor -- and won nine. A record-breaking 100 million viewers tuned in for the finale.
The show's impact went beyond ratings.
"Hundreds of colleges started Roots courses," Frank Rich, later a critic and columnist for The New York Times, wrote in Time magazine. "The National Archives in Washington found itself flooded by citizens' requests for information about their ancestors."
The series "elevated the American consciousness" about the history of slavery and its modern day impact, Mr. Amos told the New York television channel NY1 in a 2022 interview marking the 45th anniversary of "Roots."
John Allen Amos Jr. was born on Dec. 27, 1939, in Newark to John Amos Sr. and Annabelle West-Amos and grew up in East Orange, N.J. John Sr. was an auto mechanic. As a boy, John Jr. dreamed of becoming a football star.
After playing for Colorado State University, from which he graduated, and becoming a Golden Gloves boxing champion, he was signed by the Denver Broncos, but a hamstring injury led to his release on the second day of training camp. He later signed with the Kansas City Chiefs, but again was released.
After being cut from a team for the second time, and armed with a bottle of Jack Daniels while soaking in a tub, Mr. Amos recalled, he wrote a poem called "The Turk," about his failed athletic aspirations. Before he left the Chiefs' premises, he recited the poem to other players, who were "blown away" by it, he told The Los Angeles Times. It gave him new confidence in his ability to perform, he said.
After a stint as a standup comic in New York on the Greenwich Village circuit, Mr. Amos found work in 1969 as a staff writer for "The Leslie Uggams Show," a musical variety revue. He also pursued acting, making his stage debut in Los Angeles in 1971 in a production of Ron Clark and Sam Bobrick's comedy "Norman, Is That You?"
He eventually landed the lead role in a production of August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning play "Fences" in Albany, N.Y., and as a father figure opposite Denzel Washington in Dennis McIntyre's police drama "Split Second."
In the 1990s, Mr. Amos wrote and starred in a one-man show, about an 87-year-old man re-encountering Halley's comet after first seeing it at age 11. (In 1999, he created the Halleys Comet Foundation to teach at-risk children how to sail on "a 68 foot vessel that looks like a pirate ship," he told Black Film.)
Following the success of "Good Times" and "Roots," Mr. Amos appeared in dozens of other TV shows well into his 80s, including "The West Wing," "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air," "30 Rock," "Two and a Half Men" and "The Righteous Gemstones."
In film, he played Cleo McDowell, the father of Eddie Murphy's character's love interest in "Coming to America" (1988), and amassed numerous supporting parts, including in "Lock Up" (1989), starring Sylvester Stallone; "Die Hard 2" (1990); and "Dr. Doolittle 3" (2006). He also appeared in a slew of TV movies, such as "Disappearing Acts" (2000), starring Wesley Snipes.
In 2019, Mr. Amos made a cameo appearance, as himself, in the movie "Uncut Gems," starring Adam Sandler.
His survivors include a daughter, Shannon, and a son, Kelly Christopher (who goes by K.C.), both from his first marriage, to Noel J. Mickelson, in 1965; two grandchildren; and a brother, Leslie Franklin. He had no children from his second marriage, in 1978, to the actress Lillian Lehman. Both marriages ended in divorce.
In 2023, a family feud surfaced between Shannon and K.C., who accused each other publicly of neglecting to provide adequate care for their father as his health worsened. Mr. Amos dismissed the claims as "false and unmerited." The Los Angeles Police Department closed their investigation into the matter in 2024, citing a lack of evidence.
In the early 2020s, Mr. Amos began working on a docuseries with his son about their relationship. It also provided a retrospective of his long career.
"We're calling it 'America's Dad,' because so many young men have come up to me and said, 'Your father was my father,"' K.C. Amos told People magazine in 2023. "People of all walks of life -- even guys who look like bikers with ZZ Top beards -- have come up to me and said, 'Can I give you a hug? Your father was my father, man.' And they just want a chance to shake his hand."

Building a World Out of Beads: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A gun, a bottle of Jack Daniels, a splatter, a million beads. With these details, the California artist Liza Lou tells you stories. And just a minuscule bead, she explains, is like an underlined word: it can focus your attention, and slow you down.
"Beads highlight what is ordinary and make you look at it," said Lou, known for her life-size beaded sculptural installations, including "Kitchen" (1991-96), in the collection of the Whitney Museum, and "Back Yard," acquired in 2002 by the Fondation Cartier. She was speaking recently in front of "Trailer," another massive construction, originally made 25 years ago and filled with tens of millions of Czech glass beads. It just arrived at the Brooklyn Museum.
Lou, 55, has reached a turning point in her career, as she transitions from the objects that put her on the map -- the Museum of Modern Art recently acquired a beaded teacup and saucer -- into more abstract work, all created with her favorite material, which she called "tiny messengers of pigment, dot size expressions of joy."
Carmen Hermo, a curator who worked on the "Trailer" installation, said, "There is a tenderness to the attention that Liza pays" to every detail and bead placement. The meticulousness of works like "Trailer," she added, "just kind of messes with your mind. There's something so everyday but also very uncanny about it."
Lou, a feminist artist and art school dropout who received a MacArthur Foundation ("genius") grant in 2002, started her career thinking big and small simultaneously, with "Kitchen," a full-scale replica -- down to the dishes in the sink; an actual refrigerator; a box of Frosted Flakes -- composed of perhaps 30 million cylindrical beads, according to one estimate. She created it entirely solo, beginning in 1991; it took five years to complete.
It was followed by "Back Yard" and then by "Trailer," the final piece of what she sometimes thinks of as an Americana trilogy. It asks questions about whose labor is valued, and how; about self-sufficiency and isolation; about gender and power. It is also winningly flecked with humor, rewarding close observation.
"Trailer," which Lou worked on from 1998-2000, fills a 35-foot-long midcentury Spartan Royal Mansion mobile home. The museum had to remove its back doors to roll it into place. A gift of the collectors Sherry and Joel Mallin -- he is a trustee -- it will be on view in the lobby indefinitely.
Its grayscale interior tells a very different story from the primary colored, Pop Art-esque delights of "Kitchen" and "Back Yard." It is more narrative and masculine, by design.
It's also a league away from the abstract expressionist bead-laden paintings in her sold-out exhibition at Lehmann Maupin, on view in its Chelsea gallery through Oct. 12.
In Lou's mind, if you look out the window of "Kitchen," past "Back Yard," maybe down an alley, you'll see "Trailer." She bought it from some desert homesteaders, in part for its shape -- "really, a little sinister," she said.
In America, she said, "it turns out that often trailers are the last place a person lives. " (This one, she noted, has a particular coffin shape.)
Once she cleaned it out, she began to think: "Well, what happened in here? Who lived here?"
"I wasn't going to just be talking about leisure," she added. "I was going to be talking about loss."
"My material tends to get people all kind of giddy," Lou said. "Like this 'Ya -- hoo! Cocoa Puffs' kind of reaction to the beads. And I wanted to just drain all that and sort of take the viewer by the hand through a darker and darker place."
"The darker place was in the 'Kitchen' and those other works too," she continued, just "not quite so apparent."
Lou doesn't sketch much, but she may first paint her patterns out. Often working on her hands and knees, she lays strands of beads on a glue-covered surface, painstakingly pushing them into place with a toothpick. "To me, it doesn't feel intense," she said. "In my head when I'm doing this, I feel like I'm making sweeping gestures -- like I'm skydiving."
"It's a sense of fascination," she went on. "Like, how could you physically do that? How would you put this tiny material on an entire 35-foot-long room? That sounds impossible, and really hard. And then there's this big piece of me that's like, 'Hell yeah, let's do that!' It's just crazy how much fun it is to me. It's funny to me that it's weird to people."
Lou had some assistance for bigger parts, like the walls -- a "surreal wood panel," she called it. The flooring throughout the trailer is based on an Egyptian pattern. Even in monochromatics, the glint of beads gives everything an almost Vegas pizazz. "I love pattern," she said, citing Henri Matisse's shapes and the wit of Marcel Duchamp as inspirations.
"I think about the beads themselves almost in a literary sense -- word by word, sentence by sentence," she added.
The portrait she was building was of a solitary person whose objects -- hunting gear, girlie magazines, booze -- suggest a stereotypical macho-ness. It's all so palpably lifelike, it seems as if smoke could rise from the ashtray.
Until "Trailer" she had never put a human form in her work. Then she added a leg with an Oxford shoe in the bedroom, a revolver nearby, the sound and light of an old film noir blaring behind a door. She was circumspect about what the scene represented.
"I think that as an artist, you're dealing with your own mortality," she said, "in the making and describing of a certain life." The object she's most proud of in "Trailer" is a typewriter, surrounded by crumpled paper, and a handwritten note: "Keep your eyes on the road to liberty." Strung together, the tableau was a tale too.
"All the furniture is built, it's all papier-mâché. You can't sit on anything in the trailer. It is an actual bottle of Jack. I'm not going to say whether or not I drank it."
Applying a delicate material like a seed bead to a weapon -- "Trailer" is filled with blades and guns -- made her laugh. "It's twisted," she said. "It's wrong. It shouldn't be done."
Lou began experimenting with abstract images, the focus of her gallery show of framed canvases that combine beads and paint, after she returned from almost a decade in South Africa, where she worked with a female collective of bead artisans. Back home in Los Angeles, she thought she was done with the material; she donated her entire 30-year collection to her studio team. But they kept cropping up, including in a shipment of her belongings from South Africa: totally new beads. "They keep stalking me," she said, pointing to a gold orb wedged into the grooves in her sneaker sole.
For her show at Lehmann Maupin, she mixed Japanese glass beads with paint and applied them with a brush, building undiluted "strokes" of beaded color and texture that was quickly permanent.
"I'm trying to make the heroics of painting even more heroic," she wrote in her artist's statement. Like Jackson Pollock, she didn't premeditate, letting pigment land where it might -- her own commentary on the male stars of 1950s Abstract Expressionism, where, she joked, "every brush stroke is a penis."
Viewed closely, her work looks organic, like a vibrant coral reef that teems with hidden life, and some resembled the emotionally intense brushstrokes of Joan Mitchell.
Lou sees a connection between the decades-old "Trailer" and her newest paintings, which she was itching to get back to making in her studio in Joshua Tree, Calif. "It's like taking masculinity with a twinkle in your eye," she said.
When Lou started out, the divide between what was considered art and craft was still bright. "Why wasn't Native American basketry looked at, taken seriously and understood?" she said. "Why weren't they seen as the first abstract artists?"
While she never borrowed directly from Native American traditions, "I certainly was arguing for its importance through using beads," she added. "I'm saying, this is just as valid as paint."
And it's more elemental than that. Examining paint under a microscope, Lou saw clusters that, she said, "look just like beads" -- or like micro-organisms, cellular life itself.
"It turns out that everything, underneath, looks like a bead."

Full text: Pearl House, at 160 Water Street, is designed to bring personality to its neighborhood -- whether you think that's FiDi or the Seaport.
At first glance, 160 Water Street looks like one of the many office buildings packed close together on the border of the financial district and the Seaport neighborhood of Manhattan.
But an office building it is not -- at least, not anymore. Pearl House, at 160 Water Street, is the latest in a surge of commercial-to-residential conversions driven by the abundance of unused office space and the advent of remote or hybrid work policies.
The developer, Vanbarton Group, and the architect, Gensler, transformed a 1970s-era office building into the hip new rental. That meant constructing a new lobby, reallocating the square footage from mechanical shafts to new units and amenity spaces, and upgrading the facade, to make the windows operable by residents. The developer also added five floors to the top, for a total of 30 floors.
Residents began moving into Pearl House in December. The building has 588 units -- studio, one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments with monthly rents ranging from $ 3,600 to more than $ 7,000. But for some tenants, the amenities -- which include a bowling alley, a game room, co-working spaces, a bar and a spa -- may justify the high sticker price.
The apartments at Pearl House are staged with more personality than the typical model unit. They are playful, with interiors that look lived-in on purpose. According to Joey Chilelli, a managing director of Vanbarton Group, the idea was that "each person could be like, 'I can see myself there,"' before even applying.
One studio looks straight out of a millennial TikTok or Instagram feed, with its evil-eye coffee coasters, bright duvet covers and flower-printed coffee pot on the stove. Another, called the "cowboy unit," has a Johnny Cash poster on the wall, bottles of Jack Daniels whiskey on the countertop, and a handwritten journal containing the lyrics of Hank Williams's song "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry."
The in-unit washer and dryer, front-desk concierge, and 24/7 package room sealed the deal for Aleksandra Gavazova, who works in business analytics at Liberty Mutual Insurance and is pursuing a graduate degree at New York University. But a sense of community was equally crucial, she said, since she moved to New York from Boston in January and had toured her unit via FaceTime.
"Most buildings nowadays have amenities, so it's not like I was going to not have any amenities in a different building," said Ms. Gavazova, who pays around $ 3,400 monthly for her studio unit. "But having a common space where people hang out to have that community feeling was pretty important."
Like many newcomers, Pearl House will need to attract renters to a neighborhood that is in flux -- and trying to shake off a reputation for stuffiness.
But Downtown Manhattan was a draw for Ms. Gavazova. "I personally don't feel like I'm in FiDi," she said. "I don't necessarily think that there is a FiDi community, or I haven't found it or felt it yet, but there is, for sure, a Seaport one."
These interviews have been edited for clarity.
Joey Chilelli, managing director, Vanbarton Group
We are incredibly excited to breathe new life into this building. You're going to have thousands of people here and all those different life stories. We're changing the street and the neighborhood -- the neighborhood is so much more lively today than it used to be. And we're a part of that change and breathing new life. New retailers are going to be coming in because they want to be close to this base. Then, I fully believe that offices will see all of that activity and want to be around here, too. So it's a cycle of sorts that we're contributing to in a very good way.
Robert Fuller, architect and principal, Gensler
We don't want it to feel like an office, especially when you walk in. I think, in the interiors, we're more successful in that. And we tried to do little things where we could -- respecting the bones of the building, but still trying to give it a little bit softer, more of a residential hospitality feel. What's unique about conversions is that they're all quite different and unique. The solutions vary, where I'd argue a lot of ground-up residential is very cookie-cutter in its planning and approach.
Aleksandra Gavazova, resident
What I love the most about being in a new building is that all of the residents are moving in. They're all new. Nobody knows each other from before. Some of them are moving from a different part of the city. But some of them, like myself, are coming from a different state or city. Everybody's open to chat, mingle, make new friends and meet new people. That community feeling that's created around this energy is what I enjoy. There is more of a communal feeling in the Seaport, the cobbled Stone Street, the Tin Building. When the weather is nicer, people go out by the water to a small boardwalk.
Gilya Bisk, property manager
What's always been important in my career is having this place feel like home. I think that's a differentiator between any building. There's always going to be a new and sexy building that's built, but what feels like home? Does the staff take care of me? Do they remember my name? Do they watch me when I walk the dog out? A lot of people, when they're new to the city, they want to find their people, their friends. So you meet people, you develop a team, you have a sense of community in a place where New York can feel really lonely sometimes.

Jack Daniel's Moves to a Higher Shelf: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: The Tennessee whiskey, long snubbed by connoisseurs and collectors, is suddenly grabbing attention with a series of special releases.
Anton Coleman, an avid fan of American whiskey with several hundred bottles in his collection, lives on the outskirts of Nashville, less than an hour's drive from Lynchburg, the home of one of the distilling world's most famous names, Jack Daniel's.
Yet until recently, not one of his bottles bore the distinctively filigreed Jack Daniel's label.
"Four years ago, I'd have told you, 'Jack isn't bourbon, and it sucks,' " said Mr. Coleman, a cybersecurity specialist.
Most serious whiskey collectors and critics would probably have agreed. They considered Jack Daniel's -- especially its flagship brand, Old No. 7 -- bland and unctuously sweet, the sort of thing best left for shots and cheap cocktails.
But then, Mr. Coleman noticed a change in the way people on social media were talking about Jack Daniel's. Gone was the mocking disdain, replaced by not just respect, but thirst.
A number of new, limited releases were coming out of the distillery, bearing the kind of characteristics that make whiskey hounds salivate -- single-barrel bottling, high alcohol levels, heavily charred barrels. People loved what they tasted, and said so, setting off a FOMO stampede to snap up the bottles before they vanished.
"I was like, 'Whoa!' " Mr. Coleman said. He joined the rush, and today owns 30 to 40 bottles. "They've really stepped up their game."
Even as Jack Daniel's retains its position as one of the highest-volume whiskey brands in the world -- in 2022 it sold 14.6 million nine-liter cases, almost all of it Old No. 7 -- the distillery has been quietly remaking its image to attract a more discerning crowd.
It seems to be working. The company's special releases, which vary in style from year to year, are so coveted that people have been known to camp out in front of liquor stores the night before they arrive.
One such bottle, a 12-year-old version of Old No. 7, appeared this spring at a suggested price of about $ 80. Just 6,200 cases were made, not nearly enough to meet demand, and after quickly selling out it began appearing on secondary markets for as much as $ 500.
Critics like what the distillery is doing, too. In 2022, Whisky Advocate crowned Jack Daniel's Bonded -- a term meaning that the spirit is, among other things, at least four years old and 100 proof -- as its whiskey of the year. A year earlier, the magazine had ranked another release, a 10-year-old version of Old. No. 7, in fourth place.
All of this is by design. Jack Daniel's and its corporate owner, the Brown-Forman Corporation (which also makes Woodford Reserve and Old Forester bourbons), are responding to a seismic shift in the American whiskey world.
Until the last decade or so, whiskey drinkers in the United States tended to be fiercely loyal to a single brand, and valued stolid continuity over innovation. Such loyalty is what built Jack Daniel's into a national symbol: Musicians like Frank Sinatra and Axl Rose swore by it, and carried bottles of it onstage. Sinatra had a bottle placed beside him in his coffin.
But a new generation of drinkers, raised in a world with thousands of whiskeys to choose from, have made brand loyalty a thing of the past. There is just too much to explore -- especially when they're inundated with Instagram photos and YouTube videos of other fans talking up some sought-after new release.
"Jack Daniel's had a monopoly on rock stars, on motorcycle clubs. It had such immense brand loyalty," said David Driscoll, the owner of Two-Nineteen Marketing, a consulting company focused on wine and spirits. "Yet now it finds itself in a time where there's no more brand loyalty."
The distillery had long offered a small portfolio of whiskeys beyond Old No. 7, like Gentleman Jack, which is filtered through maple charcoal twice -- instead of the usual single pass -- for extra sweetness. But they often struck drinkers as afterthoughts, and mostly appealed to the converted.
Then, in 2013, Jack Daniel's released a special bottle to commemorate Sinatra's love for the brand. The whiskey, Sinatra Select, was aged in barrels whose charred insides had been grooved, allowing the liquid to penetrate deeper into the wood and acquire a richer flavor.
The release, which is now a part of the distillery's core portfolio, proved so popular that in 2015 Jack Daniel's released Sinatra Century, a one-time release at 100 proof, packaged in a black lacquered box. It quickly became a collector's item, and now sells for as much as $ 4,000 at auction -- proof that Jack Daniel's could crack into the luxury market.
"Sinatra in that way showed us that we've got this capability," said Chris Fletcher, the master distiller at Jack Daniel's.
More annual releases soon followed. The 2021 bottling drew from barrels kept on the top floors of the distillery's hilltop Coy Hill warehouse, where, exposed to high heat in the summers, they lost unusual amounts of water. The resulting whiskey had a proof level as high as 148.3, or nearly 75 percent alcohol.
The first Coy Hill release cost about $ 70, but sold out and was soon going for nearly $ 1,000 on secondary markets. It was so popular, in fact, that Mr. Fletcher concocted a second release -- this time with a maximum proof of 155.1. It also quickly sold out.
Other recent releases, some of which are now permanent parts of the company's portfolio, include a single malt finished in oloroso sherry casks, a twice-barreled rye whiskey and Triple Mash, a blend of bourbon, rye and malt whiskey.
None of this happened overnight; it takes years for a whiskey to mature. But at a distillery as large as Jack Daniel's, there are many different potential components and tweaks that can make even a whiskey as predictable as Old No. 7 reveal something new.
"For me, it all adds up to another way for us to tell our story of how we make whiskey in Lynchburg and what our whiskey makers do here," Mr. Fletcher said. "It's just a lot of fun, and it's interesting for me to be able to start peeling back these nuances of different things that we have and different levers that we can pull."
Jack Daniel's isn't the only distillery pursuing this sort of innovation strategy. Practically every whiskey maker has gotten into the limited-edition game, to the point where the sheer choice can crowd out the regular releases, said Paul Ryan, a whiskey drinker in Framingham, Mass.
"It's as if I have to strain to find a bottle of Knob Creek Nine Year Old amid the bottles of Knob Single Barrel, Knob 12 Year Old and Knob 15 year," he said, citing several of the recent limited-release extensions of Jim Beam's traditional Knob Creek bourbon.
Still, if constant innovation is now the norm, then Jack Daniel's is well positioned, if only because it has been a wallflower all these years.
"A lot of brands have already used up their innovation cachet," said Mr. Driscoll, the marketing consultant. "Jack Daniel's still has a lot of tricks up its sleeve."

Justices Rule Against Toy Resembling Liquor Bottle: [National Desk]

Full text: The case, a trademark dispute, pitted Jack Daniel's against Bad Spaniels Silly Squeakers, which looks like the distiller's distinctive bottle and adds potty humor.
The Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that the First Amendment did not protect a chew toy for dogs resembling a bottle of Jack Daniel's from a lawsuit claiming trademark infringement.
The toy, the Bad Spaniels Silly Squeaker, has the shape and other distinctive features of a bottle of Jack Daniel's but with, as an appeals court judge put it, "lighthearted, dog-related alterations."
The words "Old No. 7 Brand Tennessee Sour Mash Whiskey" on the bottle are replaced on the toy by "the Old No. 2, on your Tennessee carpet." Where Jack Daniel's says its product is 40 percent alcohol by volume, Bad Spaniels' is said to be "43 percent poo."
A tag attached to the toy says it is "not affiliated with Jack Daniel Distillery."
Justice Elena Kagan, writing for a unanimous court, seemed amused by the dispute. "This case is about dog toys and whiskey," she wrote, "two items seldom appearing in the same sentence."
She added that the characteristics of the whiskey bottle were familiar to almost everyone.
"A bottle of Jack Daniel's -- no, Jack Daniel's Old No. 7 Tennessee Sour Mash Whiskey -- boasts a fair number of trademarks," she wrote. "Recall what the bottle looks like (or better yet, retrieve a bottle from wherever you keep liquor; it's probably there)."
After reproducing a color photograph of the bottle, she continued: "'Jack Daniel's' is a registered trademark, as is 'Old No. 7.' So too the arched Jack Daniel's logo. And the stylized label with filigree (i.e., twirling white lines). Finally, what might be thought of as the platform for all those marks -- the whiskey's distinctive square bottle -- is itself registered."
Trademark cases generally turn on whether the public is likely to be confused about a product's source. In the Bad Spaniels case, a unanimous three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, said the First Amendment required a more demanding test when the challenged product was expressing an idea or point of view.
"The Bad Spaniels dog toy, although surely not the equivalent of the Mona Lisa, is an expressive work" that uses irreverent humor and wordplay to poke fun at Jack Daniel's, Judge Andrew D. Hurwitz wrote for the panel.
But Justice Kagan said there was no role for "any threshold First Amendment filter" in the case. Rather, she wrote, "the infringement claim here rises or falls on likelihood of confusion."
That is the classic inquiry in trademark cases. But Justice Kagan, in returning the case to lower courts to analyze it, said the chew toy's mockery of the liquor bottle had to figure in the analysis, as it was not obvious that consumers would think that Jack Daniel's was responsible for a toy poking fun at itself.
Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. made a similar point when the case was argued in March, imagining a pitch meeting with a Jack Daniel's executive.
"Somebody in Jack Daniel's comes to the C.E.O. and says: 'I have a great idea for a product that we're going to produce. It's going to be a dog toy, and it's going to have a label that looks a lot like our label, and it's going to have a name that looks a lot like our name, Bad Spaniels, and what's going to be purportedly in this dog toy is dog urine,"' Justice Alito said, suggesting that consumers were unlikely to think the chew toy was produced or endorsed by the distiller.
Justice Kagan echoed the point in her opinion. "Consumers," she wrote, "are not so likely to think that the maker of a mocked product is itself doing the mocking." She added, "Self-deprecation is one thing; self-mockery far less ordinary."
In a concurring opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justice Alito, cautioned lower courts against being too credulous in assessing surveys, which are commonplace in trademark litigation, "that purport to show that consumers are likely to be confused by an allegedly infringing product."
Those surveys, she wrote, "may reflect a mistaken belief among some survey respondents that all parodies require permission from the owner of the parodied mark."
In a Supreme Court brief in the case, Jack Daniel's Properties v. VIP Products, No. 22-148, lawyers for the distiller wrote that "everyone likes a good joke." But the chew toy, the brief said, "confuses consumers by taking advantage of Jack Daniel's hard-earned good will."
Lawyers for the toy's manufacturer, VIP Products, said it was following "in the playful parodic tradition that has ranged over a half-century from Topps's Wacky Packages trading cards through 'Weird Al' Yankovic."
The trading cards, for fake products that mimicked real ones, like Ratz Crackers, Jolly Mean Giant and Gulp Oil, were enormously popular in the 1970s, for a time outselling Topps baseball cards. "Yet the world did not end," VIP Products told the justices.

Andrew Bellucci, 59, Pizza Prophet Derailed By Criminal Past, Dies: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: His obsession with recreating the original New York pizza helped revive a classic and inspire a generation of chefs. But his ambitions led to conflicts and, once, prison.
Andrew Bellucci, who in the 1990s became one of the first chefs in New York City to achieve fame for pizza, then lost his job and reputation when an old crime caught up with him, only to return more than two decades later to a city full of pizzaioli inspired by his artisanal, traditionalist approach, died on Wednesday in Queens. He was 59.
He collapsed from heart failure while working at his restaurant, Andrew Bellucci's Pizzeria, in Astoria, said Matthew Katakis, his business partner. He was pronounced dead at a hospital a short time later.
Mr. Bellucci's pizzas first won attention when he worked at Lombardi's, a revival of a venerable coal-fired pizzeria on Spring Street in Little Italy. Nancy Silverton, Todd English and other chefs came to to taste his pizza, which was a far cry from the foldable, gold-and-orange and mostly interchangeable slices sold across the city. Ms. Silverton was especially impressed by a pie topped with fresh clams, garlic, oregano and olive oil.
"The glory is the crust: light, thin, crisp yet elastic, blackened and blistered and full of the smoky flavor that comes from the coal oven," Eric Asimov wrote in a review in The New York Times in 1995.
New York pizza had long been celebrated, but its origins were obscure, its techniques little understood and its makers unknown to all but a few regulars. Mr. Bellucci saw things differently.
He had learned the craft of pizza in the East Village, baking pies at Two Boots and then Three of Cups, now closed. But he learned the lore of pizza at the public library, where he spent his off hours poring over old phone books, newspapers and advertisements.
Mr. Bellucci's reading convinced him that the first pizza in the United States had been baked in a coal-fired oven on Spring Street by Gennaro Lombardi, an immigrant from Naples. Transfixed, he began nosing around Little Italy until, on Spring Street, he located a vacant bakery with a coal-burning oven. He kept searching until he found Mr. Lombardi's grandson, also named Gennaro, and persuaded him to put the family name on a pizzeria with the oven he had found. Mr. Bellucci would make the pies.
Mr. Bellucci didn't just twirl dough, however. He told stories about pizza, pizza ovens, pizza families and pizza legacies, and these stories brought attention to styles and methods that other pizza makers would explore over the next few decades.
"He helped usher in the revival of classic coal-fired New York pizza, which was really a return to the way pizza was before it became a slice-shop food on every street corner," said Scott Wiener, a columnist for the trade magazine Pizza Today.
"He allowed things like Neapolitan pizza to come back, which led to the neo-Neapolitan pizza of Roberta's, Paulie Gee's, Ops, etc.," Mr. Wiener went on, naming three leading wood-oven pizzerias in the city. "Which has led to what we have now" -- a diverse pizza ecosystem in which even street-corner slices are considered worthy of serious attention.
One day in 1995, two agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation walked into Lombardi's, ordered a pizza and ate it. They left with Mr. Bellucci in handcuffs.
The charges against him stemmed from an earlier job as an administrator at a Manhattan law firm, Newman Schlau Fitch & Lane. Talkative and personable, Mr. Bellucci had been popular at the office.
He once invited the lawyers and other employees to a party he threw in a restaurant on Christopher Street, according to "Untitled Pizza Movie," a nearly four-hour documentary that is largely about him. There was an open bar and a live band.
One guest looked around and said to her husband, one of the firm's partners, "He must be stealing from you."
She was right, although it would take months for the firm to determine that Mr. Bellucci had embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars. By that time, he had left the firm and seemed to vanish.
Federal investigators suspected that he had fled the country. In fact, he was on Spring Street, stretching dough and giving interviews. Eventually, one of his television appearances tipped off the authorities.
"Why would someone on the lam allow his picture to be taken hundreds of times?" said Ed Levine, the author of "Pizza: A Slice of Heaven" and one of the first writers to praise Mr. Bellucci's pizza. "He was clearly addicted to attention."
Mr. Bellucci eventually pleaded guilty to 54 counts of fraud and was sentenced to 13 months in federal prison.
In a phone interview from prison with Mr. Asimov, he dismissed the seriousness of his crime, saying that his victims were just a law firm, an insurance company and a bank. "It's not exactly like sticking up an old lady," he said.
When he was released on bond, the court stipulated that he be tested for drugs, and his sentencing recommended drug counseling. Mr. Bellucci, in the interview, denied using drugs.
Other parts of his story unraveled. Contrary to his claims, he had never been a partner in Lombardi's.
He had also led journalists to believe that he had been following Lombardi's heirloom recipes. Years later, though, he told Mr. Wiener that the dough was the same one he had made at Two Boots.
He told people that he was from the Bronx. Lawyers at Newman Schlau Fitch & Lane were led to believe that a grandmother of his had, as a Jew, survived the Holocaust.
In fact, Andrew Thierry Bellucci was born on Jan. 21, 1964, in Jersey City, N.J., to Patrick Basil Bellucci and Jeanne-Marie (Schmiederer) Bellucci, both from Roman Catholic families.
Mr. Bellucci is survived by his mother; his brother, Joel; and his wife, Geetanjali Peter, with whom he was estranged. His sister, Chantel, died of cancer at 14.
For several years after his release from prison, in 1997, Mr. Bellucci drove a taxi and drifted in "pizza purgatory," as he put it in the documentary. He tried to return to Lombardi's, but the owners would not have him.
In 2013, an ad on Craigslist led to a position as the founding chef of Mikey's Original New York Pizza, a group of American-style pizzerias that was just starting in Malaysia.
Later, he would say that the job "got me back in the game," but the hours were long and he had no friends in Kuala Lumpur, where he lived alone in an empty apartment. One night, he said in the documentary, he swallowed what he recalled as 50 Vicodin tablets chased by Jack Daniels in a suicide attempt. He lived, although he was two hours late to work the next morning.
Returning to New York in 2017, he worked as a driver, a chef at Rubirosa on Mulberry Street and a consultant on several far-flung pizzerias. All the while he looked for a backer to finance his dream restaurant, a cathedral of pizza where clam pies would take up a full page on the menu, the clams shucked to order by a worker at a prominent station built to resemble a pulpit.
No Medici stepped forward, but in 2020, he was hired to open a more modest, 300-square-foot shop in Astoria, Bellucci Pizza. His employer, Leo Dakmak, owned a piercing shop on St. Marks Place and a tattoo parlor, but was a novice in the pizza business.
"He got my vision and said he would follow me blindly," Mr. Bellucci told The New York Post. "I told him that was maybe the stupidest thing he would ever do."
Baked in a new $ 35,000 electric oven, the pizza came in 25 varieties, including pepperoni with vodka sauce and chicken-bacon-ranch. All pies and slices, the restaurant said, were sprinkled with 18-month-aged pecorino Romano and ground aranya peppercorns harvested in Kerala, India.
Less than a year later, Mr. Bellucci quit. Mr. Dakmak said that they had argued about "repeated high charges on the company credit card."
Mr. Bellucci told the food website Grub Street that "the final straw" had been Mr. Dakmak's desire to open a second shop "whether I was there or not." Almost immediately, he found a new associate, Matthew Katakis. Together they built a splashy, red-and-white restaurant a few blocks from Bellucci Pizza and nearly five times its size.
They named it Bellucci Pizzeria. Mr. Dakmak, who had trademarked the name Bellucci Pizza, sued.
The legal action, popularly but imprecisely known as Bellucci v. Bellucci, was irresistible to the news media, generating at least as much press as Mr. Bellucci had received during his criminal case. In an out-of-court settlement, he agreed to rename his restaurant Andrew Bellucci's Pizzeria.
Although he had 18 pizzas on the menu, three kinds of dough and any number of toppings, two aspects of his trade preoccupied Mr. Bellucci above all. One was what Mr. Katakis called "a borderline lunacy" about dough. The other was clam pizza.
"Other people put clam pie on the menu but nobody's that meticulous," Mr. Katakis said. "He figured out that the clams were going on the pizza cold, so he figured he should sous vide them," heating them in a hot-water circulator for 45 seconds before baking.
Mr. Bellucci was preparing clam pizzas as a surprise for some guests when he died.
His return to the ovens as a celebrated old hand brought Mr. Bellucci into contact with a younger generation of bakers who are as obsessed with the minutiae of pizza as he was. He became a mentor to many of them, inviting them to work in his kitchen, sharing recipes and advising them before they went on to open their own pizzerias.
Few were old enough to remember the dark ages when Mr. Bellucci first began telling New Yorkers that their city had an important pizza legacy to live up to.
"Nobody was trying to bring respect to pizza," Mr. Levine said. "It took a convicted felon to do that. That's kind of crazy when you think about it."

Chew Toy for Dogs Provokes a Spirited Argument at the U.S. Supreme Court: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The justices differed about whether the toy, shaped like a bottle of Jack Daniel's, violated the distiller's trademark rights or was protected by the First Amendment.
WASHINGTON -- In a lively and lighthearted argument on Wednesday, the Supreme Court considered the fate of the Bad Spaniels Silly Squeaker, a chew toy for dogs that looks a lot like a bottle of Jack Daniel's, with the addition of some potty humor.
Trademark cases generally turn on whether the public is likely to be confused about a product's source. In the Bad Spaniels case, a unanimous three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, said the First Amendment requires a more demanding test when the challenged product is expressing an idea or point of view.
"The Bad Spaniels dog toy, although surely not the equivalent of the Mona Lisa, is an expressive work" that uses irreverent humor and wordplay to poke fun at Jack Daniel's, Judge Andrew D. Hurwitz wrote for the panel.
The words "Old No. 7 Brand Tennessee Sour Mash Whiskey" on the bottle are replaced on the chew toy by "the Old No. 2, on your Tennessee carpet." Where Jack Daniel's says its product is 40 percent alcohol by volume, the Bad Spaniels toy is said to be "43 percent poo."
A tag attached to the toy says it is "not affiliated with Jack Daniel Distillery."
The justices on Wednesday were divided across several dimensions, expressing varied views on whether the toy was a purely commercial product or an expressive one, on whether consumers were justifiably confused about its source, on whether the toy amounted to a parody of the liquor brand and on the role the First Amendment should play in the legal analysis.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked whether a political party could sue over a T-shirt created by an activist mocking a trademarked animal logo like a donkey or an elephant.
Lisa S. Blatt, a lawyer for Jack Daniel's, said the answer turned on whether a substantial number of people were confused about the source of the shirt. "You do have to get permission if it's confusing," she said.
Justice Sotomayor disagreed. "They don't need permission to make a political joke," she said. "They don't need permission to make a parody."
Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said that no sensible person would think the Bad Spaniels chew toy was authorized by the liquor company. He imagined a pitch meeting with a top executive.
"Somebody in Jack Daniel's comes to the C.E.O. and says: 'I have a great idea for a product that we're going to produce. It's going to be a dog toy, and it's going to have a label that looks a lot like our label, and it's going to have a name that looks a lot like our name, Bad Spaniels, and what's going to be purportedly in this dog toy is dog urine,"' Justice Alito said.
The executive, Justice Alito added, was not likely to say: "That's a great idea. We're going to produce that thing."
Ms. Blatt said the test was whether ordinary consumers, not federal judges, would be confused about the source of a product.
"You went to law school," she told Justice Alito, who graduated from Yale. "You're very smart. You're analytical."
Justice Alito responded that he "went to a law school where I didn't learn any law." On the other hand, he said: "I had a dog. I know something about dogs."
Bennett E. Cooper, a lawyer for the toy's manufacturer, VIP Products, said consumer surveys cannot be the basis for censoring constitutionally protected expression. "The First Amendment is not a game show," he said, "where the result is: 'Survey says I'm confused, stop talking."'
Justice Elena Kagan said that other cases might present hard questions. But this one, she said, was easy.
"This is not a political T-shirt," she said. "It's not a film. It's not an artistic photograph. It's nothing of those things. It's a standard commercial product."
Ms. Blatt indicated that she did not want to win solely on that ground. The key question, she said, was not whether the toy was commercial but whether consumers were confused about who made it. A ruling limited to the first rationale, she said, would leave important questions unresolved.
"You immediately get into the situation," she said, "of you're saying: 'I will allow a confusing short film but not a confusing commercial; I'll allow a confusing painting, but I won't allow a confusing wallpaper; I'll allow a confusing video game, but I won't allow a confusing board game; I will allow a confusing tapestry but not a confusing rug."
In questioning Mr. Cooper, the lawyer for the chew toy's manufacturer, Justice Kagan said she did not get the joke.
"Maybe I have no sense of humor," she said. "But what's the parody?"
Mr. Bennett said the toy poked fun at a brand that took itself too seriously.
That struck the justice as an unduly flexible and forgiving standard. "You make fun of a lot of marks: Doggie Walker, Dos Perros, Smella Arpaw, Canine Cola, Mountain Drool," she said. "Are all of these companies taking themselves too seriously?"
Mr. Cooper said yes.
At least one other court has rejected a trademark infringement claim against a dog toy, though without bringing the First Amendment into it.
In 2007, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va., ruled in favor of a company called Haute Diggity Dog, saying it was entitled to sell Chewy Vuiton dog toys that looked like miniature Louis Vuitton handbags.
Judge Paul V. Niemeyer, writing for a unanimous three-judge panel, said the toy "immediately conveys a joking and amusing parody."
"The furry little 'Chewy Vuiton' imitation, as something to be chewed by a dog, pokes fun at the elegance and expensiveness of a Louis Vuitton handbag, which must not be chewed by a dog," he wrote, adding: "The dog toy irreverently presents haute couture as an object for casual canine destruction. The satire is unmistakable."
Ms. Blatt said that case and the one before the justices, Jack Daniel's Properties v. VIP Products, No. 22-148, were very different.
"Louis Vuitton makes dog products, but they're $ 1,200," she said. "They're complete luxury products."
By contrast, she said, "Jack Daniel's makes dog products and sells licensed merchandise, like hats and bar stools and what have you, in the same markets that Bad Spaniels was selling its dog toys."

Whiskey Fungus Fed by Jack Daniel’s Encrusts a Tennessee Town

The ethanol-fueled fungus known as whiskey fungus has thrived for centuries around distilleries and bakeries. It’s been the source of complaints from residents who live near Kentucky bourbon distilleries, Canadian whisky makers and Caribbean rum manufacturers.
Now it is driving a wedge between some residents of Lincoln County, Tennessee, and Jack Daniel’s, the famed distillery founded in 1866 in neighboring Moore County.
For months, some residents have complained that a sooty, dark crust has blanketed homes, cars, road signs, bird feeders, patio furniture and trees as the fungus has spread uncontrollably, fed by alcohol vapors wafting from charred oak barrels of aging Jack Daniel’s whiskey.
Jack Daniel’s has built six warehouses, known as barrelhouses, to age whiskey in rural Lincoln County, which is home to about 35,000 residents, and is building a seventh on a property that has room to house one more, a company spokesman said. The distillery has asked the county to rezone a second property where it could build six additional barrelhouses.
A company representative, Donna Willis, told county officials in November that 14 barrelhouses would generate $1 million in annual property tax revenue for the county, which had approved about $15 million in general fund spending for the 2022 fiscal year.
But not all residents are happy about the expansion.
Christi Long, who owns a local mansion built in 1900 that she operates as a venue for weddings and other events, sued the county in January, contending that barrelhouses near her property lacked the proper permits. Insider previously reported on the dispute.
A judge ruled last week that one barrelhouse currently under construction had not been properly approved and that its building permit would have to be rescinded until Jack Daniel’s obtains the necessary permits.
Long’s lawyer, Jason Holleman, said he planned to ask the judge and the county to stop Jack Daniel’s from using other barrelhouses near Long’s 4,000-square-foot mansion, known as the Manor at ShaeJo.
Long and her husband, Patrick Long, said whiskey fungus had already inundated the property, darkening the copper roof and exterior walls, creeping over the rock garden and metal gate, and encrusting the branches of magnolia trees. Nearby, it blackens metal road signs, they said.
The Longs said they use a high-pressure hose to wash the property every three months with Clorox bleach and water, but the fungus always returns.
“If you take your fingernail and run your fingernail down our tree branch, it will just coat the tip of your finger,” Patrick Long said. “It’s just disgusting.”
Christi Long said her corner of Lincoln County “is going to be black as coal” unless Jack Daniel’s installs air filters in the barrelhouses, one of which sits about 250 yards from her property.
“This fungus now is on steroids,” she said.
A lawyer who represents Lincoln County declined to comment, citing the continuing litigation.
Melvin Keebler, general manager of the Jack Daniel Distillery, said in a statement that the company “complies with all local, state, and federal regulations regarding the design, construction, and permitting of our barrelhouses.”
“We are committed to protecting the environment and the safety and health of our employees and neighbors,” Keebler said.
At a county commission meeting in November, Willis, director of technical services, maintenance and barrel distribution at Jack Daniel’s, said studies have shown that the fungus is not hazardous to human health and does not damage property.
“Could it be a nuisance?” Willis said. “Yeah, sure. And it can easily be remedied by having it washed off.”
She said the company would not agree, however, to power-wash homes, saying Jack Daniel’s could be held liable for any damage.
Willis also said air filters could hurt the flavor that Jack Daniel’s whiskey acquires during the aging process. Distillers refer poetically to the liquor that evaporates during that process as “the angel’s share.”
The fungus that thrives off the lost alcohol has been noted at least since the 1870s, when Antonin Baudoin, director of the French Distillers’ Association, observed a “plague of soot” blackening the walls of distilleries in Cognac, France.
James A. Scott, a professor at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto who has studied the fungus since 2001 — and helped name its genus, Baudoinia, in honor of Baudoin — said he was not aware of any research specifically looking at the health effects of exposure to the fungus.
But the fungus can destroy property and can cling to almost any surface, he said. A puff of alcohol, Scott said, makes it remarkably resistant to temperature changes, allowing it to withstand hot summers in Tennessee.
“The fungus is pretty destructive, and the only way to stop it is to turn off its alcohol supply,” Scott wrote in an email. “It wrecks patio furniture, house siding, almost any outdoor surface. I’ve seen trees choked to death by it. It is a small mercy that it does not also appear to have a negative impact on human health.”
Tracy Ferry said she and her husband, Warren Ferry, who bought a home in Lincoln County three years ago, were hoping that Jack Daniel’s would install air filters.
Tracy Ferry said that since Jack Daniel’s built a barrelhouse next to her house in December, whiskey fungus had been accumulating on the roof of her home and car and on trees on her property. She said she had scrubbed the paint off wooden patio furniture while trying to remove the dark growth.
“I could try and sell, but what am I going to get?” Ferry said. “Who’s going to want to live here?” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Hermès Wins MetaBirkins Lawsuit: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The verdict means First Amendment protections did not apply to a digital project blurring the line between art and business.
Perturbed when an artist made a digital version of its coveted Birkin handbag with a reproduction of a mature fetus inside it, the luxury fashion brand Hermès watched in shock as other iterations popped up online. A Birkin with mammoth tusks affixed to it. One sporting the Grinch's shaggy green fur. Others stamped with van Gogh's "Starry Night" or populated by smiley emojis.
Hermès swiftly sued the artist, Mason Rothschild, over the NFT project he called "MetaBirkins," arguing that the company's trademark was being diluted and that potential consumers might be fooled into buying the unaffiliated virtual goods.
The case's ramifications extended far beyond Hermès. In some of the first litigation to scrutinize the nature of digital assets sold on the blockchain, up for debate was whether NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, are strictly commodities or art shielded by the First Amendment.
On Wednesday, a nine-person federal jury in Manhattan determined that Rothschild had infringed on the company's trademark rights and awarded Hermès $ 133,000 in total damages. The jurors also found that his NFTs were not protected speech.
Rothschild's defeat was a major blow for the NFT market, which has often described itself as part of the creator economy. But the jury determined that MetaBirkins were more similar to commodities, which are subject to strict trademark laws that prevent copycats, than to artworks where appropriation is protected.
In a statement after the verdict, Hermès said it was compelled to act to protect consumers and the integrity of its brand. "Hermès is a house of creation, craftsmanship and authenticity which has supported artists and freedom of expression since its founding," it said.
One of Rothschild's lawyers, Rhett Millsaps II, called it a "great day for big brands" and a "terrible day for artists and the First Amendment."
Rothschild criticized the jury, the justice system and a luxury fashion house that he said was emboldened to determine who qualified as an artist.
"What happened today was wrong," he said in a statement. "What happened today will continue to happen if we don't continue to fight."
The verdict could provide some guidance for brand owners, said Megan Noh, an art lawyer unaffiliated with the case, "about the line between works of artistic expression and commercial goods."
Birkin bags, named after the actress Jane Birkin, are made by hand and take specialized artisans a minimum of 18 hours to make. Hermès does not disclose how many of the bags it has made since they were first created in 1984, but some researchers of luxury goods have estimated that there are now more than a million Birkins in the market. In 2021, the auction house Sotheby's sold a Birkin for more than $ 226,000.
Rothschild had plans to create 1,000 MetaBirkins, which he has described as an "ironic nod" to the renowned brand, but only 100 have been released since the project began in 2021.
Each was priced at $ 450, and Rothschild also received 7.5 percent of secondary sales. Hermès has claimed in court filings that MetaBirkins reached about $ 1.1 million in total sales volume. Rothschild has estimated that he made about $ 125,000 from the NFTs, including the initial sales and royalties.
"What we see in the Hermès case is how emerging technologies and historic, age-old brands collide," said Ari Redbord, head of legal and government affairs at TRM Labs, a blockchain analytics firm.
Over the past decade, the French company's Birkin collection has steadily generated $ 100 million in sales each year. In recorded testimony played during the trial, Robert Chavez, president and chief executive of Hermès of Paris, said he was not aware of any revenue that the company lost because of MetaBirkins.
During opening arguments in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Oren Warshavsky, a lawyer representing Hermès, argued that MetaBirkins confused consumers who thought they were connected to the fashion brand.
"The reason for these sales was the Birkin name," he said.
Rothschild's legal team questioned whether people wealthy enough to afford Birkins, which cost thousands of dollars and often have yearslong wait lists, would be genuinely misled by his art project.
Millsaps also argued that the NFTs were art that was protected under the First Amendment as free speech. The lawyer said Birkins were a "cultural symbol of rarefied wealth and status," ripe for artists to explore as metaphors of consumerism.
"Art doesn't exist in a vacuum -- it's often about context," he said.
Blockchain assets like MetaBirkins were part of the financial boom-and-bust cycle in cryptocurrencies over the past few years. At the market's height there was a $ 40 billion industry around digital collectibles, but fortunes eroded last year as the volume of NFT sales fell by 97 percent.
Yet lawsuits are still playing out across the beleaguered industry, including trademark fights focused not on the technology itself, but the essence of what users have stored on the blockchain.
Yuga Labs, the creator of the NFT franchise Bored Ape Yacht Club, has filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against the artist Ryder Ripps, accusing him of copying its imagery. (Ripps has said the lawsuit attacks his free speech rights.) The company announced on Monday that it had settled a separate case against Thomas Lehman, a developer on Ripps's NFT project, who admitted to infringing on the Yuga Labs brand.
Noh said the best protection artists have against trademark disputes is the Rogers test, a legal standard established in 1989.
In that case, the actor Ginger Rogers had sued the movie producer Alberto Grimaldi, arguing that the film "Ginger and Fred" violated her trademark rights because it used her name in connection with its fictionalized depiction of a pair of washed-up Italian dancers. But a federal appeals court determined that the use of the name Ginger was an expressive element of the title, artistically relevant to the underlying film, and therefore subject to First Amendment interests that needed to be weighed against the risk of misleading consumers.
Rebecca Tushnet, a Harvard Law School professor who helped prepare Rothschild's defense, said the Rogers test meant "you can't hold someone liable for infringement unless their work is artistically irrelevant or explicitly misleading."
During the trial's opening arguments, Hermès attempted to minimize Rothschild's credibility and artistic intent by focusing on his business strategy, displaying text messages in which he asked social media influencers to "do one more shill post" that might raise demand for his NFTs. The company's lawyer also told the jury that Rothschild had publicized its cease-and-desist letter on social media, hoping that conflict might drive interest.
Judge Jed S. Rakoff granted Hermès's motion to exclude a report prepared by the art critic Blake Gopnik that favorably compared the MetaBirkins to artwork by Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst. (Gopnik contributes to The New York Times.)
The defense painted a more sympathetic picture of Rothschild, 28, who worked in retail for streetwear brands and luxury brands like Saint Laurent after dropping out of college. In 2021, he and Ericka del Rosario, now his fiancée, opened a concept store in Los Angeles called Terminal 27. He often hired assistants with the technical skills he lacked to work on projects, including MetaBirkins.
Rothschild was "a conceptual artist," Millsaps, his lawyer, said. "The idea guy, not the guy who executes the job."
The strength of trademark rights will soon be tested again when a case between Jack Daniels and VIP Products, which sold squeaky dog toys resembling the whiskey maker's bottles, goes in front of the Supreme Court.
Some veterans of the fashion industry wondered why Hermès had bothered litigating the case at all. Although Chavez testified that the company had been experimenting with its own NFTs, including a project intended for release this year, it has let other unsanctioned projects slide, like when the Brooklyn collective MSCHF turned the Birkin bag into $ 76,000 "Birkinstocks."
Ian Rogers, the former chief digital officer of the fashion conglomerate LVMH, who currently works at a crypto company named Ledger, said the company's preoccupation with Rothschild was puzzling.
"Maybe this hit close to home," Rogers said. "Luxury people should understand NFTs, because if you have been in the business of explaining why someone would spend $ 18,000 on a bag then you are pretty well-suited at explaining why someone would pay $ 3,000 for an NFT."

Perturbed when an artist made a digital version of its coveted Birkin handbag with a reproduction of a mature fetus inside it, luxury fashion brand Hermès watched in shock as other iterations popped up online. A Birkin with mammoth tusks affixed to it. One sporting the Grinch’s shaggy green fur. Others stamped with Vincent van Gogh’s “Starry Night” or populated by smiley emoji.
Hermès swiftly sued the artist, Mason Rothschild, over the NFT project he called “MetaBirkins,” arguing that the company’s trademark was being diluted and that potential consumers might be fooled into buying the unaffiliated virtual goods.
The case’s ramifications extended far beyond Hermès. In some of the first litigation to scrutinize the nature of digital assets sold on the blockchain, up for debate was whether NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are strictly commodities or art shielded by the First Amendment.
On Wednesday, a nine-person federal jury in Manhattan determined that Rothschild had infringed on the company’s trademark rights and awarded Hermès $133,000 in total damages. The jurors also found that his NFTs were not protected speech.
Rothschild’s defeat was a major blow for the NFT industry, which has often described itself as part of the creator economy. But the jury determined that MetaBirkins were more similar to commodities subject to strict trademark laws that prevent copycats than artworks for which appropriation is protected.
“Some brand owners have likely been waiting for better guideposts before jumping into Web3 and enforcing their marks in that space,” said Megan Noh, an art lawyer unaffiliated with the case, referring to an idea of a future internet based on decentralization.
The verdict could provide some guidance, she added, “specifically in the context of digital artworks and collectibles, about the line between works of artistic expression and commercial goods.”
Birkin bags, named after actress Jane Birkin, are made by hand and take specialized artisans a minimum of 18 hours to make. Hermès does not disclose how many of the bags it has made since they were first created in 1984, but some researchers of luxury goods have estimated that there are now more than 1 million Birkins in the market. In 2021, auction house Sotheby’s sold a Birkin for more than $226,000.
Rothschild had plans to create 1,000 MetaBirkins, which he has described as an “ironic nod” to the renowned brand, but only 100 have been released since the project began in 2021.
Each was priced at $450, and Rothschild also received 7.5% of secondary sales. Hermès has claimed in court filings that MetaBirkins reached about $1.1 million in total sales volume. Rothschild has estimated that he made about $125,000 from the NFTs, including the initial sales and royalties.
“What we see in the Hermès case is how emerging technologies and historic, age-old brands collide,” said Ari Redbord, head of legal and government affairs at TRM Labs, a blockchain analytics firm.

But the jury determined that MetaBirkins were more similar to commodities, which are subject to strict trademark laws that prevent copycats, than to artworks where appropriation is protected.
In a statement after the verdict, Hermès said it was compelled to act to protect consumers and the integrity of its brand. “Hermès is a house of creation, craftsmanship and authenticity which has supported artists and freedom of expression since its founding,” it said.
One of Rothschild’s lawyers, Rhett Millsaps II, called it a “great day for big brands” and a “terrible day for artists and the First Amendment.”
Rothschild criticized the jury, the justice system and a luxury fashion house that he said was emboldened to determine who qualified as an artist.
“What happened today was wrong,” he said in a statement. “What happened today will continue to happen if we don’t continue to fight.”
The verdict could provide some guidance for brand owners, said Megan Noh, an art lawyer unaffiliated with the case, “about the line between works of artistic expression and commercial goods.”
