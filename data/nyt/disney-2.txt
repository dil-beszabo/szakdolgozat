Abstract: None available.

Full text: People, businesses and towns relying on park tourism worry the fourth shutdown in a decade could crush them if Congress can't reach a deal to keep the government running.
It's wedding season at Acadia National Park in Maine, and Tabitha Brown can barely keep up with the demand for her "luxury picnics" -- champagne and charcuterie served seaside.
The fall rush around Acadia helps workers survive winter's lean months. But that's all at risk if a government shutdown forces America's national parks and monuments to lock their gates, scuttling millions of vacations and school trips, and costing tourist towns from the Everglades to Yellowstone to Death Valley an estimated $ 70 million a day.
"I don't know what anybody would do," said Ms. Brown, who holds 90 percent of her picnics inside Acadia. "If the park shuts down, nobody wants to come. It would be tragic."
It would also be the fourth time in a decade. Business owners and workers say that recurrent shutdowns have become a new kind of disaster alongside the floods, wildfires and hurricanes that come with living at the doorstep of a natural wonder.
"I'm getting to the point where it's just part of the business," said Nicole Schultz, who runs Green Jeep Tours in Estes Park, Colo., and is scrambling to plan alternative routes in case Rocky Mountain National Park closes down next week. "That doesn't mean I like it. You just have to accept this."
The Department of the Interior, which oversees national parks and monuments, has not said when or how it might close its more than 400 national parks sites and furlough its 20,000 workers.
The lack of information has frustrated some business owners and workers as the government's funding deadline of Sept. 30 ticks closer. Parks that were shuttered under President Barack Obama during a 2013 shutdown were largely left open but unstaffed by President Donald J. Trump during a shutdown five years later.
Now, businesses and mayors say they have little idea what to expect.
"We don't know what's happening," said Charles Wright, who runs boat tours into Everglades National Park in Florida. He said he could lose $ 5,000 a day if tourists from Europe, Canada and the Northeast see the park is closed, start canceling their reservations and head to Disney World instead.
The Big Cypress National Preserve, where he runs kayaking tours, is also likely to close, he said, adding that he is strapped to find alternatives for his customers.
"They get to go bowling instead," he said.
The governors of Arizona and Utah said they would use state money to staff and run the parks if the federal government could not, following a playbook that they and several other states used during prior shutdowns.
Gov. Katie Hobbs of Arizona said the state would spend state lottery funds to keep the Grand Canyon open. And in Utah's bustling red-rock deserts, state officials said they wanted to ensure that tourists kept visiting and spending around Arches, Capitol Reef, Zion, Bryce Canyon and other national sites.
The price tag will depend on how long the shutdown drags on, and which parks states want to keep open. During the 2013 shutdown, Arches was a relative bargain, costing Utah $ 7,662 a day to operate, according to Jonathan B. Jarvis, a former National Park Service director under Mr. Obama. Running Grand Canyon cost Arizona $ 93,000 a day. The park generated $ 710 million in tourist spending last year.
The Interior Department, which experts say would have to approve those arrangements, said it had no comment.
The national parks, which drew 312 million visitors last year, are often the most emotionally charged symbols of Washington's malfunction during shutdowns.
The Obama administration closed the parks entirely during a 16-day shutdown in 2013, gating off the National Mall and closing the Statue of Liberty. Local economies lost $ 500 million in tourism spending, and protesters in Utah who were upset at being kept off public lands jumped the gates and tried to occupy the parks.
Republican politicians accused the administration of using the closures to amplify the pain of the shutdown.
Mr. Trump kept the parks open but unstaffed during a longer shutdown that began in December 2018, causing what environmental groups described as widespread damage. When rangers went back to work, they said they found graffiti, human waste outside locked bathrooms and tire tracks in fragile desert soil. There were toppled Joshua trees in the Mojave Desert and dead endangered birds on park roads, former parks officials said.
"It was a disaster," Sally Jewell, who served as Interior secretary in the Obama administration, said in an interview.
Senator John Barrasso, a Republican whose home state of Wyoming includes Yellowstone and Grand Teton, last week urged the Interior Department to keep the parks open using money from fees. But former Interior Department officials and conservation groups said they expected the Biden administration to close most of them.
"You can't have them open without protection," Ms. Jewell said. "They're our nation's cultural and historical natural treasures."
But closing is more complicated than just telling campers to pack up. Can commercial fishermen or tribal members with treaty rights keep fishing? Can people visit relatives buried in the cemeteries inside Great Smoky Mountains National Park? Should people really be banned from walking down the National Mall?
Towns at the edge of national parks are urging tourists to keep their travel plans. Even if Rocky Mountain National Park closes down, it is still Elk Fest in Estes Park, Colo., and the town is packed with herds of majestic ungulates bugling for a mate. A mother and her calf slowed traffic the other day, and bull elk are splashing around the town lake.
"There's plenty to see," Mayor Wendy Koenig said. "We've got beautiful leaves. There's a lot of other things besides the park."
Ms. Koenig said the town's hotels, restaurants and shops were busy, reflecting a pandemic-era surge in tourism that has left many in national-park towns complaining about traffic, congestion and garbage. She was optimistic that Estes Park's businesses would survive a shutdown.
Tourism workers like Nicholas Jennings, 42, are more on edge. Mr. Jennings takes tourists on Jeep tours of Rocky Mountain National Park on a vertiginous loop that overlooks the Continental Divide.
He gets paid by the tour, and said he did not know how he would make his monthly $ 1,200 rent if the park closed. Grocery prices at the main supermarket in town have soared in the past two years, and takeout costs at least $ 20.
"I don't know how I'm going to live," he said.
In Gatlinburg, Tenn., Erik and Vesna Plakanis have been "obsessively" watching the news and having emergency staff meetings to discuss how their tour guiding outfit can survive if they cannot lead backpacking trips into Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
The summer's extreme heat and humidity seemed to keep many tourists away, but October was shaping up to be a record-breaking month. Their tour company, A Walk in the Woods, had been forced to lay off employees during the pandemic, and they had hoped that a killer October would sustain their business and their 30 employees through the winter.
"We're a seasonal business," Ms. Plakanis said. "It'll completely wreck us."
The Plakanises said they blamed hard-right Republicans in the House of Representatives for bringing the country to the precipice of a shutdown that would hurt their business and their neighbors. Federal workers have received back pay after previous shutdowns have ended, but the Plakanises said nobody would extend the same help to them and their employees.
"They're taking money out of people's pockets," Ms. Plakanis said. "You cannot get a season back. Once the season ends, that's it."

The Incredible Shrinking Off-Season: [Travel Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The heat, mobs and high prices of recent summers are making off-season travel more popular -- perhaps too popular, some say, as they watch prices rise and crowds grow.
As a traveler who prefers the off-season for its more affordable prices and fewer visitors, I try not to fly in July and August, at least in the Northern Hemisphere. I wait until fall when rates for flights and hotels normally plunge and crowds shrink.
Or they used to.
This year, hotels in Florence, Italy, in September were charging close to summer highs. I was priced out of Key West, Fla., in November, a historically slow month. Considering the eco-friendly resort Playa Viva near Zihuatanejo, Mexico, for the first week of December -- long a bargain time to travel -- I could find only one night available at rates below $ 500.
What, I wondered, happened to the off-season?
"September is the new August," said Jack Ezon, the founder of Embark Beyond, a high-end travel agency based in New York City, explaining that the frenzy for European travel stretched the calendar. Nearly a third of his clients who regularly travel to the Mediterranean in July and August rescheduled for June, September or October.
"People are making choices to avoid the crowds and the heat," said Virgi Schiffino Kennedy, the founder of Lux Voyage, a travel agency based in Philadelphia.
"I'm seeing summer rates creeping into shoulder season," she added, noting that destinations like Santorini and Mykonos in Greece, which peak in July and August, "are now impossible to book in September."
School calendars still largely dictate the biggest peaks in travel annually, but the dips are not as dramatic -- in numbers and in rates.
"I think we're at the beginning of a change," said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst who runs the firm Atmosphere Research Group based in San Francisco, crediting flexible work schedules for the trend. "Summer will always be peak season, but I think we'll see more off-peak travel in fall, winter and spring so those valleys may be less deep."
The shoulder season surge
Travel is most certainly back -- the World Travel & Tourism Council said the industry will recover 95 percent of 2019 activity this year -- but it's not a replica of prepandemic patterns.
Compared to 2019, global leisure stays were up 12 percent in spring 2023 at more than 230 Sofitel and MGallery hotels. Fall 2022 bookings were up 7 percent for leisure guests compared to the same period prepandemic.
"Booking shoulder season was once travel's best-kept secret, but more people are catching on to the trend," said Matt Berna, the president for the Americas of Intrepid Travel, a global tour company. He said fall and spring bookings this year have grown by 56 and 70 percent, respectively, compared to prepandemic business, inspiring the company to increase its departures to meet the demand.
The river cruise line AmaWaterways has done the same, adding new itineraries for November and February.
G Adventures, which offers small-group trips, said bookings by Americans are up 40 percent this year over 2019. When summer trips in Italy sell out, travelers are bound to look deeper into the calendar, said Steve Lima, the vice president of growth for the U.S. and Latin America for G Adventures.
"It's like Disney's always busy and there's no good time, so you just go," Mr. Lima said.
Katie Parla, a Rome-based cookbook author who guides private food tours, described a pig-in-the-pipeline scenario where travelers who booked a tour for their 35th wedding anniversary weren't able to take it until their 37th because of travel restrictions and complications over the past few years.
"The high season used to be Easter to October, but this year Rome started to be slammed a full month earlier and my calendar is nearly full through the end of December already, which is very rare," Ms. Parla said.
The seasonal switch isn't just a European phenomenon. Apple Leisure Group, which offers value-priced vacation packages in Mexico and the Caribbean, has seen bookings more evenly distributed throughout the year over the past three years. As a result, its prices are more consistent year-round.
In an August report, Kampgrounds of America found 67 percent of campers had changed their travel plans this year because of the weather. Nearly 64 percent of campers who delayed trips planned to take them after Labor Day. The R.V. rental platform RVShare said shoulder season reservations have grown twice as fast as those in their core summer season, which it attributes to flexible work policies and efforts to avoid extreme heat.
Claire Ramsdell, 31, who works nomadically in customer service for an outdoor company and blogs about hiking, spent the summer in Bozeman, Mont., but found it too hot to work from her vehicle, forcing her to rent high-price accommodations with roommates and poor Wi-Fi.
"I'm not sure why I tried to branch out and do such a popular and expensive destination this summer," she wrote in an email from Colorado where she plans to hike this fall. "I should go back to off-season travel and less-crowded places."
The rule of school
In a recent travel forecast from Expedia, 70 percent of fall travelers are adults without children.
"We have the flexibility to get the cheapest flights and hotels and not wait in line at the Vatican, sweating with the summer crowds," said Riana Ang-Canning, 31, of Vancouver, Canada, who works in social media and travels off-season with her husband extensively.
Resolving to avoid summer's high prices and heavy traffic is easier said than done for families with school-age children, but some parents are considering workarounds.
Before the pandemic, Jennifer Glaisek Ferguson, a mother of two children ages 5 and 8 in Weston, Conn., and her family took a midsummer trip to France when it was sweltering, which they vowed not to repeat. The importance of school attendance and keeping up with the curriculum has deterred the family from skipping much school for travel, but she's open to missing a few days.
"When there's an opportunity to see something new and different where they can learn, I'm willing to take the hit," Ms. Ferguson, 53, said.
Ms. Schiffino Kennedy of Lux Voyage said her family clients tend to add a day or two onto long weekends.
"Clients call with their school calendar in front of them looking to make the most of holidays," she said, noting that she does the same; this Indigenous Peoples' Day on Oct. 9, she plans to take her 9-year-old daughter out of school a few extra days to take a five-day trip to Sedona, Ariz., and the Grand Canyon.
Misty Belles, the vice president of global public relations at the travel agency consortium Virtuoso, predicted the return of the rule of school may fuel bookings in late spring, just as classes end.
"Normally in Europe, travel doesn't start until mid-June, but I think we'll see many trying to get there early before the heat is a factor," Ms. Belles said.
Selling 'secret' season
Business-wise, the erosion of troughs in the booking calendar is intentional. Travel marketers have long pushed "green season," May through November, in Costa Rica when it's rainy but lush, and "cabernet season" in Napa Valley, November through April, when things slow down and restaurant reservations at the French Laundry may be easier to nab.
Montreal en Lumière, an annual winter festival, was established 25 years ago as a way to encourage travel to the Canadian city in a slow period. Last year, the 18-day midwinter festival drew nearly 800,000 attendees to its ice rinks and concerts. Participating restaurants were booked to 96 percent capacity.
To encourage off-season visits on Cape Cod, Pelham Hospitality, which operates three hotels, has introduced activities like indoor roller skating. Chatham Bars Inn calls September and October "secret summer" with programming, including dinner at the property's nearby eight-acre farm.
"As a destination, minimizing occupancy 'valleys' is important for maintaining year-round employment to support tourism businesses and a high-quality experience for travelers," wrote Bill Lewis, the general manager of the Magnolia Hotel & Spa in Victoria, British Columbia, and chair of the Victoria Hotel Association, in an email.
Whether it's the relative quiet, the deals or the weather, off-season conditions have gained their own renown, said Andrew Loyd, the director of Loyd & Townsend Rose, an agency that specializes in renting castles and estates in Britain and Ireland.
"I don't believe there is any longer an off-season," he said, noting that the special light in the winter months draws photographers to Scotland. "I am constantly amazed how busy places are during so-called off-season months and ultimately one realizes, the world is now a very busy place."
Downsizing slow seasons
Crowd-averse die-hards, like me, will brave Iceland in the snow, despite the dangerous driving, and visit Homer, Alaska, in October when half the shops are closed. I can have things my way: quieter, cheaper, more local.
"My love of off-season travel is rooted in being frugal, but I also cannot do the heat and would rather see the mountains when it's 30 or 40 degrees rather than 80 or 90," said Heather Bien, 38, a writer, blogger and marketer based in Washington, D.C., who is planning to stay in a glamping tent in North Carolina in December.
For folks without that kind of fortitude, it's time to stop thinking about seasons as months and instead as weeks or even days. These micro-shoulders still exist in many places in November -- excluding Thanksgiving week -- the first few weeks in December and, outside of ski destinations, in January and February.
For best results, go off-peak Monday through Thursday. At Four Sisters Inns, a collection of 17 boutique hotels in California, the lowest rates are available midweek during winter and early spring.
"The new shoulder season in Europe is winter," said Jonathan Alder, the founder of Jonathan's Travels, an agency based in Winter Park, Fla. "To be there when it's 30 to 50 percent cheaper and no crowds, go to Rome in January."
On Lake Como in Northern Italy, the Grand Hotel Tremezzo touts October as an ideal time to visit, when the weather is fair, the crowds disperse and rates are less than half of high season (starting at $ 825 a night compared to $ 1,870 in summer). But it's a short window. The hotel closes for the 2023 season on Nov. 5.

Actors Await Breakthrough As Writers Return to Work: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The leadership of the Writers Guild of America voted to end a 148-day strike. Members will start voting on the deal's ratification next week.
After 148 days on strike, television and movie writers will begin returning to work on Wednesday.
The Writers Guild of America, which represents 11,500 screenwriters, said on Tuesday that three internal boards had voted unanimously to end the strike and send a tentative contract with entertainment companies to members for ratification. The vote will start on Monday and end on Oct. 9.
Members are expected to approve the three-year deal.
"Our negotiators knew the kind of deal they had to deliver -- anything less than exceptional was not going to fly with a membership that has become younger, more active, possibly more radical," said Bryce Schramm, a writer whose credits include the CW's "Dynasty" and Disney's "Runaways."
The Writers Guild and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of the studios, reached the tentative agreement on Sunday after a bitter standoff that contributed to a near-complete shutdown of film and television production. Guild leaders have repeatedly called the terms of the accord "exceptional." Studios have declined to comment.
For the first time, the Writers Guild made those terms public on Tuesday. While not receiving everything it asked for, the union achieved major gains.
Residual payments (a form of royalty) for overseas viewing of streaming would increase 76 percent, according to the union. Netflix's foreign residual, for instance, would total $ 32,830 for a one-hour episode over three years, up from $ 18,684.
For the first time, writers will receive a bonus from streaming services that is based on a percentage of active subscribers. The guild had demanded that entertainment companies establish a viewership-based bonus to reward programs that become hits.
On the contentious issue of minimum staffing for television shows, at least three writer-producers must be hired for writers' rooms for first-season shows running 20 weeks or longer. Minimum staffing for additional seasons will be tied to the number of episodes.
Studios had initially refused to negotiate at all on the guild's demand for minimum staffing, calling it "a hiring quota that is incompatible with the creative nature of our industry." The Writers Guild had been seeking a minimum of six writers.
The Writers Guild said the tentative contract includes enhancements worth an estimated $ 233 million annually. When bargaining started in the spring, the guild proposed $ 429 million in enhancements, while studios countered with $ 86 million, according to the guild.
The tentative contract also contains guarantees that artificial intelligence technology will not encroach on writers' credits and compensation. Studios cannot use A.I. tools to rewrite original material. Writers, however, can use the technology for assistance if the company they are working for allows it; studios cannot force them to use it.
In a concession by the union, studios will be able to use film and TV scripts that they already own to refine A.I. tools and experiment.
During negotiations in April before the strike, studios refused to engage on the topic of artificial intelligence, saying too much was unknown about the technology. They said the guild would have to wait until contract negotiations in 2026. Studio leaders have since called their early refusal to negotiate on the issue an error. It was one of the reasons the guild called a strike.
Even though writers' rooms can begin running again, much of Hollywood will stay at a standstill: Tens of thousands of actors remain on strike, and no talks between the actors' union, SAG-AFTRA, and the studios have been scheduled.
The only productions that could quickly restart are ones without actors, like late-night shows hosted by Jimmy Fallon and Stephen Colbert and daytime talk shows hosted by Drew Barrymore and Jennifer Hudson.
In addition to actors, more than 100,000 behind-the-scenes workers (directors, camera operators, publicists, makeup artists, prop makers, set dressers, lighting technicians, hairstylists, cinematographers) will continue to stand idle, many with mounting financial hardship. The impact extends beyond California and New York. There are production hubs in Georgia and New Mexico, for instance.
About $ 10 billion in TV and film production is on hold, according to ProdPro, a production tracking service. That equates to 176 shows and films.
While the Writers Guild suspended picketing on Sunday, the union encouraged members to join the actors' picket lines this week -- a symbolic show of solidarity before returning to work.
"Today is an important day to pay a debt to the actors who came out to support us early during our strike, when they still had a contract," Mr. Schramm, the writer, said on Tuesday as he arrived at Paramount Pictures with a picket sign. "It's also nice to gather with other writers and feel some ownership over our victory."
About 80 people were marching outside Paramount by midmorning. Roughly a third wore blue Writers Guild shirts. A smattering of people had donned sparkly tutus in honor of a "tutu Tuesdays" theme. Someone had brought a boom box, which was blaring "I'm Still Standing" by Elton John.
The comedic actor Jack Black ("Jumanji") carried a picket sign reading, "We Ain't Done Yet," while the Emmy-winning Bob Odenkirk ("Better Call Saul") sported a black SAG-AFTRA shirt.
The mood was buoyant, even euphoric.
"I can't imagine that it will be drawn out," Kari Nicolle, an actress whose credits include "CSI: Vegas," said about the negotiations that remain between her union and the studios. "If the writers were satisfied with the A.I. protections that studios offered, then hopefully SAG will be able to piggyback."

A 'Bachelor' The AARP Finds Dreamy: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The latest "Bachelor" spinoff stars singles who are 60 and older, a largely ignored demographic in the ever-growing world of dating shows.
Drivers in Los Angeles heading north on La Cienega Boulevard these days might notice a bronzed gentleman smiling down at them from billboards poised on either side of the street.
He is Gerry Turner, an Indiana retiree who used to work in the food distribution industry. But as one of the billboards explains, those were not the qualifications that led to his becoming the star of the newest "Bachelor" spinoff.
"He's hot. He's sexy. He's 72."
The appraisal was taken from a recent headline about Turner, who as the first "Golden Bachelor" is the center of a new spin on the franchise that features singles 60 and older.
"This is certainly the first time in a 'Bachelor' campaign that we used a quote from AARP in our billboards," said Shannon Ryan, who oversees the show's marketing.
That "The Bachelor" is trying a slight variation on a tested formula is no revelation. The show's myriad spinoffs have included "The Bachelorette," "Bachelor in Paradise," "The Bachelor" in Canada, "The Bachelor" in wintry weather, "The Bachelor" with a cash prize, and "The Bachelor" featuring people who work in the music industry.
But in all of those variations on the theme, most of the eligible singles have been young, fresh-faced 20- or 30-somethings looking to marry for the first time. In "The Golden Bachelor," which premieres on Thursday, the nearly two dozen women vying for Turner's attention are between 60 and 75 and include divorcées, widows, mothers and grandmothers.
Sitting in the show's Mediterranean-style mansion in Agoura Hills, Calif., last month, a few hours before an evening of filming began, Bennett Graebner, one of the showrunners, recalled the new cast's giddy introduction to the lavish home, with its infinity pool and Jacuzzis that look out onto the tree-dotted hills.
At first, he said, the contestants' reactions were similar to the ones he has seen over his 15 years as a producer for "The Bachelor."
"They ran around and looked at their bedrooms and yelled off the balcony, and we said, 'OK, this feels like "The Bachelor,""' Graebner said. "And they came down to the kitchen and had mimosas and they were doing toasts, and we said, 'OK, this feels like "The Bachelor.""'
"And then," he went on, "one woman said, 'Let's toast to Social Security!"'
He hadn't heard that one before.
With "The Golden Bachelor," ABC is recognizing that a core segment of its audience -- the network's median viewer age is 64 -- has thus far been largely ignored in the ever-growing array of dating shows. (The median age drops to 42 for ABC shows streaming on Hulu.)
In recent years, some programs have experimented with older participants, though not on this level and not with much success.
In "Dating Around," Netflix's first original dating series, which had its debut the year before "Love Is Blind" became a global phenomenon, the fan favorite was Leonard, a 70-year-old private investigator. On his dinner dates, he reminisced about doing LSD in his younger years and danced the Lindy Hop with one woman on the sidewalk.
Last year, executive producers behind the popular dating show "Love Island" introduced a new show called "My Mom, Your Dad" on HBO Max, in which college-age adults watched their parents dating each other from a secret viewing room. The show didn't last long, but an adaptation in Britain called "My Mum, Your Dad" just had its finale.
And then there's "MILF Manor" on TLC, in which eight mothers in their 40s, 50s and 60s found themselves at a Mexican hotel in a dating pool that consisted of their adult sons.
Howard Lee, the president of TLC, said that "MILF Manor" intrigued the network because of its age bracket, which stuck out from the deluge of dating show pitches he gets featuring people in their 20s and 30s.
"For the first time, this was a series that didn't go in that direction," he said. "MILF Manor" had a viral moment on social media -- partly driven by its similarity to a "30 Rock" gag -- but it is not yet clear whether it will get a second season.
With "The Golden Bachelor," in which the participants are as young as 60, the idea is getting its tryout in an altogether different league. After more than two decades, the "Bachelor" franchise remains a reality juggernaut, and "The Golden Bachelor" will be one of ABC's biggest releases this fall, in part because of the network's narrowed list of offerings during the Hollywood writers' and actors' strikes.
If "The Golden Bachelor" succeeds, expect more opportunities to arise for senior singles to look for love on television.
The showrunners said a broader cultural shift toward embracing, rather than hiding, aging helped pave the way for this show.
"Martha Stewart is on the cover of Sports Illustrated at 80 or so years old," said Jason Ehrlich, one of three "Golden Bachelor" showrunners. "John Stamos was posting photos of himself in the shower nude for his 60th birthday. There seems to be a moment where there's an appetite for this."
"Bachelor" producers have been talking about a show like this for about a decade. Their efforts to make it a reality started in earnest in 2019, and they began circulating ads to recruit "seniors looking for love" in 2020. But Covid-19 put the idea on hold. ("This is not the show to make in the middle of a pandemic," Graebner said.)
When the producers returned to the concept earlier this year, they rediscovered Turner's audition tape. In it he explains that he is ready to find another partner after losing his wife of 43 years, whom he met in high school, to a sudden infection.
In an interview, Turner, a father and grandfather, said he is "very, very grateful, not just for myself but for people my age, that this show has been developed and it has come to reality."
The women of "The Golden Bachelor" brought into the mansion a certain self-assured humor that comes with age, the show's producers said. For example, the cast debated for days whether it was Susan's meatballs or Edith's guacamole that gave the house gas. And in Thursday's premiere episode, when one of the women steps out of the limousine and greets Turner she opens with one thing they both have in common: hearing aids.
The women's fun facts include that Christina's first concert was the Beatles in 1964 and that Kathy is "OBSESSED" with Christmas. Several of the participants, including Turner, share an enthusiasm for pickleball. And some of the women also have long careers behind them; Marina, 60, has three master's degrees.
"When we cast for the other shows, some of the younger kids come to us and they have a feeling that they need to present a version of themselves that we want to see," said Claire Freeland, the third "Golden Bachelor" showrunner. "These women were just themselves from the jump."
When dating shows have included older people in the past, it has often been as a kind of gimmick. The original "Dating Game," which premiered in 1965, once brought on Kathryn Minner, an actress who was known for playing the "little old lady" characters on TV, movies and, most famously, in an ad campaign for Dodge vehicles.
"The Bachelor" has always been fond of puns and stunts, and the golden edition is likely to have plenty of age-related bits. In the mansion, there is a supply of Werther's Originals -- just like in your grandmother's living room -- and the show's promo introducing the female contestants includes footage of a woman cleaning her glasses and another slipping on pantyhose, to the tune of "Believe" by Cher.
But the producers have tried to let the age-related humor be driven by the participants themselves.
"We're never laughing at them, but we are certainly laughing with them," Ehrlich said. He said he studied the sitcom "The Golden Girls" to find interesting conversation topics to pull out if things get dull.
The showrunners insist that this is not just a show for the older viewers of "The Bachelor," about 43 percent of whom are 55 and older, according to a 2020 YouGov poll.
They think "The Golden Bachelor" has the potential to bring generations together to watch a more-wholesome version of the franchise. They also hope that a different kind of cast can entice lapsed "Bachelor" fans back into the fold and bring in new audiences who might have turned their noses up at the brand before now.
The ads, for example, won't have the typical reality show snippets of screaming-and-crying dramatics, opting instead for more uplifting messaging, said Ryan, the president of marketing for Disney Entertainment Television, which includes ABC.
Even Eileen Zurbriggen, a feminist social psychologist who has argued in her research that dating TV shows like "The Bachelor" are actively harming young viewers' capacity to start healthy relationships, in part by strengthening the perception of dating as a kind of game, said she saw potential for the show to work against gender clichés.
"It is refreshing, in a culture that is still so youth obsessed, to see older women presented as interested in sex and still sexually desirable," Zurbriggen said.
April Jayne, an actress, singer and fitness trainer who was one of the contestants on "MILF Manor," said she spent much of her acting career hiding her age. Now at 61, she is seeing more work opportunities than ever before since her reality TV appearance.
"Once you hit middle age, it does not mean you're washed up," Jayne said, though she noted that the 40-year age gap between her and the young man she was dating on the show was perhaps a bit too large.
By the way, she added, if ABC happens to be casting for a "Golden Bachelorette," she is interested and available.

A Strike Ends, And Eyes Turn To the Actors: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The studios and the actors' union haven't spoken for more than two months, but a deal is needed before the entertainment industry can fully return.
Hollywood's actors are back in the spotlight.
With screenwriters reaching a tentative agreement with the major entertainment studios on a new labor deal on Sunday night, one big obstacle stands in the way of the film and TV industry roaring back to life: ending the strike with tens of thousands of actors.
The two sides have not spoken in more than two months, and no talks are scheduled.
Leaders of SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union, have indicated a willingness to negotiate, but the studios made a strategic decision in early August to focus on reaching a détente with the writers first. A big reason was the rhetoric of Fran Drescher, the president of the actors' union, who made one fiery speech after another following the strike, including one in which she denounced studio executives as "land barons of a medieval time."
"Eventually, the people break down the gates of Versailles," Ms. Drescher said after the actors' strike was called in July. "And then it's over. We're at that moment right now."
Ms. Drescher has been less vocal in recent weeks, however. Only a resolution with the actors will determine when tens of thousands of workers -- including camera operators, makeup artists, prop makers, set dressers, lighting technicians, hairstylists, cinematographers -- return to work.
The actors' union offered congratulations to the Writers Guild of America, which represents more than 11,000 screenwriters, in a statement on Sunday night, adding that it was eager to review the tentative agreement with the studios. Still, it said it remained "committed to achieving the necessary terms for our members."
With a tentative deal in hand, the Writers Guild suspended picketing. But protests by actors will begin again on Tuesday, after a break for Yom Kippur on Monday. "We need everyone on the line Tuesday-Friday," the actress Frances Fisher, a member of the SAG-AFTRA negotiating committee, said on Sunday on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. "Show us your #Solidarity!"
Dozens of Writers Guild members vowed to support the actors. "I know there's a huge sign of relief reverberating through the town right now, but it's not over for any of us until SAG-AFTRA gets their deal," Amy Berg, a Writers Guild strike captain, wrote on X.
Their support will go only so far, however. Writers Guild negotiators were unsuccessful in receiving the contractual right to honor other unions' picket lines; writers will be required to return to work, perhaps before a ratification vote is final.
It has been 74 days since the actors' union and representatives of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of the studios, have talked. That will probably soon change given the high stakes of salvaging the 2024 theatrical box office, which will be in considerable jeopardy should Hollywood not be able to restart production within the next month. The TV production window for the remainder of the year is also closing, given the coming holidays.
Restarting talks with the actors' union is a bit more complicated than it sounds. For a start, SAG-AFTRA officials will need time to scrutinize the deal points achieved by the Writers Guild; those wins and compromises will inform a new bargaining strategy for the actors. Also, talks between studios and writers restarted only after leaders on both sides spent time back-channeling about the thorniest issues and seeing if there was a willingness to negotiate. Studios are likely to try the same strategy with the actors.
The soonest that negotiations between actors and the studios could restart is next week, according to a person directly involved in the process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the strike.
Neither SAG-AFTRA nor the studio alliance commented on Monday.
"There's tremendous pressure on both sides to get this done," said Bobby Schwartz, a partner at Quinn Emanuel and a longtime entertainment lawyer who has represented several of the major studios. "The deal that the Writers Guild and the studios struck economically could have been worked out in May, June. It didn't need to go this long. I think the membership of SAG-AFTRA is going to say we've been out of work for months, we want to go back to work, we don't want to be the ones that are keeping everybody else on the sidelines."
The dual strikes by the writers and the actors -- the first time that has happened since 1960 -- have effectively shut down TV and film production for months. The fallout has been significant, both inside and outside the industry. California's economy alone has lost more than $ 5 billion, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom.
Warner Bros. Discovery said this month that the impact from the labor disputes would reduce its adjusted earnings for the year by $ 300 million to $ 500 million. Additionally, share prices for other major media companies like Disney and Paramount have taken a hit in recent months.
The industry took a meaningful step toward stabilization on Sunday night, though, with the tentative deal between the writers and studios all but ending a 146-day strike.
The deal still needs to be approved by union leadership and ratified by rank-and-file screenwriters. "I'm waiting impatiently to see what the exact language is around A.I.," said Joseph Vinciguerra, a Writers Guild member and a professor at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts.
The approval vote by union leadership is expected on Tuesday.
Though the fine print of the terms has not been released, the agreement has much of what the writers had demanded, including increases in compensation for streaming content, concessions from studios on minimum staffing for television shows and guarantees that artificial intelligence technology will not encroach on writers' credits and compensation.
"We can say, with great pride, that this deal is exceptional -- with meaningful gains and protections for writers in every sector of the membership," the Writers Guild's negotiating committee said in an email to members.
On Monday, President Biden released a statement applauding the deal, saying it would "allow writers to return to the important work of telling the stories of our nation, our world -- and of all of us."
The prospective writers' deal should provide a blueprint for the actors, since many of their demands are similar.
Union leaders for the actors said their compensation levels, as well as their working conditions, were worsened by the rise of streaming. Like screenwriters, actors have been terrified by the prospects of artificial intelligence. They are worried that it could be used to create digital replicas of their likenesses -- or that performances could be digitally altered -- without payment or approval, and are seeking significant guardrails to protect against that.
The actors, however, have had several demands that the studios balked at, including a revenue-sharing agreement for successful streaming shows. The actors have also asked for significant wage increases, including an 11 percent raise in the first year of a new contract. The studios last proposed a 5 percent raise.
Though the entertainment industry had been bracing for a work stoppage by the writers going back to the beginning of the year, the actors' uncharacteristic resolve this past summer caught studio executives off guard.
The actors last went on strike in 1980. By comparison, the writers previously walked out in 2007 for 100 days.
The first worrying sign came in June when more than 60,000 actors authorized a walkout with 98 percent of the vote -- a margin that even eclipsed the writers' strike authorization. Then, as bargaining began, the studios saw the actors' list of demands. Union leaders handed over a list that totaled 48 pages, nearly triple the size of their asks during the last contract negotiations in 2020.
While bargaining was going on, more than 1,000 actors, including Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence and Ben Stiller, signed a letter to guild leadership saying that "we are prepared to strike." The union called for a strike a little more than two weeks later.

Wall Street Recoups Some Losses but Is on Pace for Ugly Month: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street clawed back some of its steep losses from last week, but September is still on track to be its worst month of the year despite Monday's gains.
The S&P 500 rose 17.38, or 0.4 percent, to 4,337.44, coming off its worst week in six months. The Dow Jones industrial average edged up by 43.04, or 0.1 percent, to 34,006.88, and the Nasdaq composite gained 59.51, or 0.5 percent, to 13,271.32.
Oil-related stocks led the way, as Exxon Mobil rose 1.1 percent and ConocoPhillips gained 1.6 percent. As a group, energy stocks in the S&P 500 climbed nearly twice as much as any of the other 11 sectors that make up the index.
While crude oil prices were mixed Monday, they've leaped sharply since the early summer.
Oil's jump has hurt Wall Street broadly, where the realization is sinking in that the Federal Reserve will likely keep interest rates high well into next year. The Fed is trying to ensure high inflation gets back down to its target, and it said last week it will likely cut interest rates in 2024 by less than earlier expected. Its main interest rate is at its highest level since 2001.
The growing understanding that rates will stay higher for longer has pushed yields in the bond market up to their highest levels in more than a decade. That in turn makes investors less willing to pay high prices for all kinds of investments, particularly those seen as the most expensive or making their owners wait the longest for big growth.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.54 percent from 4.44 percent Friday and is near its highest level since 2007. That's up sharply from about 3.50 percent in May and from 0.50 percent about three years ago.
"Stocks digest gradual, growth driven increases in interest rates far better than rapid increases driven by other factors such as inflation or Fed policy," Goldman Sachs strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a report.
Higher yields are at the head of a long line of concerns weighing on Wall Street. Not only have oil prices jumped by $ 20 per barrel since June, economies around the world are looking shaky. The resumption of U.S. student-loan repayments may also weaken what's been the U.S. economy's greatest strength, spending by households.
In the near term, the U.S. government may be set for another shutdown amid more political squabbles on Capitol Hill. But Wall Street has managed its way through previous shutdowns, and "history shows that past ones haven't had much of an impact on the market," according to Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley.
On Wall Street, Amazon rose 1.7 percent and was the strongest single force pushing up on the S&P 500. The company announced an investment of up to $ 4 billion in Anthropic, as it takes a minority stake in the artificial intelligence start-up. It is the latest Big Tech company to pour money into A.I. in the race to profit from opportunities that the latest generation of the technology is set to fuel.
Stocks of media and entertainment companies were mixed after unionized screenwriters reached a tentative deal on Sunday to end their historic strike. No deal yet exists for striking actors.
Netflix rose 1.3 percent, while The Walt Disney Co. slipped 0.3 percent. Warner Brothers Discovery dropped 4 percent for the day's largest loss in the S&P 500.
Also on the losing end of Wall Street were stocks of travel-related companies, which slumped under the weight of worries about higher fuel costs. Southwest Airlines sank 2 percent, and Norwegian Cruise Line fell 3.1 percent.
In stock markets abroad, indexes slumped across Europe and much of Asia. France's CAC 40 fell 0.8 percent, and Germany's DAX lost 1 percent.
In China, troubled property developer China Evergrande sank nearly 22 percent after announcing it was unable to raise further debt because of an investigation into one of its affiliates.

Soft Corruption and the Limits of Populism: [Op-Ed]

Full text: There are currently two clown shows -- sorry, but let's be honest -- going on in the Republican Party. One is the intraparty fighting that seems extremely likely to cause a government shutdown a few days from now. The other is the fight over who will come a distant second to Donald Trump in the presidential primaries.
There are many strange aspects to both shows. But here's the one that has long puzzled me: Everyone says that with the rise of MAGA, the G.O.P. has been taken over by populists. So why is the Republican Party's economic ideology so elitist and antipopulist?
Listen to the rhetoric of the people making Kevin McCarthy look like a fool or of the presidential candidates, and it's full of attacks on elites -- but also of promises to cut taxes for the rich and slash government spending that benefits the working class. For example, Nikki Haley -- who is making a credible bid to be Trump's also-ran, given Ron DeSantis's implosion -- is calling for big cuts to Social Security and Medicare.
As I write this, McCarthy is reportedly trying to appease MAGA dissidents with a temporary funding bill that would cut nonmilitary discretionary spending outside of Veterans Affairs by 27 percent -- meaning savage cuts to things like the administration of Social Security (as opposed to the benefits themselves).
The thing is, such proposals are deeply unpopular. It's true that Americans tell pollsters that the government spends too much, but if you ask them about specific types of spending, the only area on which they say we spend too much is foreign aid, which is a trivial part of the budget. Oh, and most Americans still support aid to Ukraine.
So there would seem to be an opening for politicians who are right wing on social issues like immigration and wokeness but are also genuinely populist in their spending priorities. Such politicians exist in other countries. For example, Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister, whose party has deep links to the nation's fascist past, ran last year on a platform calling for earlier retirement for some workers and increases in minimum pensions and child benefits.
So why aren't there such figures in the G.O.P.? To be fair, during the 2016 campaign Trump sometimes sounded as if he might turn his back on Republican economic orthodoxy, but once in office he pursued the usual agenda of tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy combined with benefit cuts for the rest.
Part of the answer may lie in the American right's general mind-set, which valorizes harshness, not empathy. People who are drawn to MAGA tend to imagine that solving society's problems should involve punishing people, not helping them.
Also, we shouldn't underestimate the power of ignorance: MAGA politicians, who generally disdain any kind of expertise, may not have any clear idea of what the federal government does and where tax dollars go.
Finally, there's the Clarence Thomas factor.
What I mean is that part of the explanation for the absence of genuine Republican populists may involve the gravitational pull of big money, which is both broader and subtler than the way it's often portrayed.
If the accusations against Senator Robert Menendez are true -- and it's not looking good -- old-fashioned bribery, payments to politicians in exchange for favors, hasn't gone away. But it's probably not shaping party ideology.
Campaign contributions, on the other hand, definitely do shape ideology; DeSantis was touted as a rival to Trump because he got a lot of support from big donors who believed he would serve their interests and had real political skills. (Being rich doesn't necessarily come with good judgment.)
But there's a sort of gray area that doesn't involve outright bribes in the sense of money given in return for specific actions but nonetheless involves a form of soft corruption. For the fact is that public figures whom the very rich see as being on their side can reap considerable personal rewards from their positions.
Recent revelations about Justice Thomas show how this works. ProPublica reports that he has received many favors from ultrawealthy conservatives, notably lavish free vacations. These reports are shocking because we don't expect such behavior from a Supreme Court justice, and Thomas may have violated the law by failing to disclose these gifts. But does anyone doubt that many politicians who favor tax cuts for the rich and reduced benefits for the working class, even as they rail against elites, receive similar favors?
And the hermetic information space of the American right surely facilitates this soft corruption. Suggestions of improper influence on right-wing officials and politicians won't get much coverage on Fox News, except possibly for claims that they're the victims of a liberal smear campaign.
Now, I don't know how important these different factors are to the fact that America's "populists" are anything but populist in practice. But we do need to ask why people who denounce elites somehow always manage to avoid targeting corporations not named Disney and billionaires not named George Soros.

Hollywood’s actors are back in the spotlight.
With screenwriters reaching a tentative agreement with the major entertainment studios on a new labor deal on Sunday night, one big obstacle stands in the way of the film and TV industry roaring back to life: ending the strike with tens of thousands of actors.
The two sides have not spoken in more than two months, and no talks are scheduled.
Leaders of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, the actors union, have indicated a willingness to negotiate, but the studios made a strategic decision in early August to focus on reaching a detente with the writers first. A big reason was the rhetoric of Fran Drescher, the president of the actors union, who made one fiery speech after another following the strike, including one in which she denounced studio executives as “land barons of a medieval time.”
“Eventually, the people break down the gates of Versailles,” Drescher said after the actors strike was called in July. “And then it’s over. We’re at that moment right now.”
Drescher has been less vocal in recent weeks, however. Only a resolution with the actors will determine when tens of thousands of workers — including camera operators, makeup artists, prop makers, set dressers, lighting technicians, hairstylists, cinematographers — return to work.
The actors union offered congratulations to the Writers Guild of America, which represents more than 11,000 screenwriters, in a statement Sunday night, adding that it was eager to review the tentative agreement with the studios. Still, it said it remained “committed to achieving the necessary terms for our members.”
With a tentative deal in hand, the Writers Guild suspended picketing. But protests by actors will begin again on Tuesday, after a break for Yom Kippur on Monday. “We need everyone on the line Tuesday-Friday,” actress Frances Fisher, a member of the SAG-AFTRA negotiating committee, said on Sunday on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. “Show us your #Solidarity!”
Dozens of Writers Guild members vowed to support the actors. “I know there’s a huge sign of relief reverberating through the town right now, but it’s not over for any of us until SAG-AFTRA gets their deal,” Amy Berg, a Writers Guild strike captain, wrote on X.
Their support will go only so far, however. Writers Guild negotiators were unsuccessful in receiving the contractual right to honor other unions’ picket lines; writers will be required to return to work, perhaps before a ratification vote is final.
It has been 74 days since the actors union and representatives of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of the studios, have talked. That will probably soon change given the high stakes of salvaging the 2024 theatrical box office, which will be in considerable jeopardy should Hollywood not be able to restart production within the next month. The TV production window for the remainder of the year is also closing, given the coming holidays.
Restarting talks with the actors’ union is a bit more complicated than it sounds. For a start, SAG-AFTRA officials will need time to scrutinize the deal points achieved by the Writers Guild; those wins and compromises will inform a new bargaining strategy for the actors. Also, talks between studios and writers restarted only after leaders on both sides spent time back-channeling about the thorniest issues and seeing if there was a willingness to negotiate. Studios are likely to try the same strategy with the actors.
The soonest that negotiations between actors and the studios could restart is next week, according to a person directly involved in the process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the strike.
Neither SAG-AFTRA nor the studio alliance commented on Monday.
“There’s tremendous pressure on both sides to get this done,” said Bobby Schwartz, a partner at Quinn Emanuel and a longtime entertainment lawyer who has represented several of the major studios. “The deal that the Writers Guild and the studios struck economically could have been worked out in May, June. It didn’t need to go this long. I think the membership of SAG-AFTRA is going to say we’ve been out of work for months, we want to go back to work, we don’t want to be the ones that are keeping everybody else on the sidelines.”
The dual strikes by the writers and the actors — the first time that has happened since 1960 — have effectively shut down TV and film production for months. The fallout has been significant, both inside and outside the industry. California’s economy alone has lost more than $5 billion, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom.
Warner Bros. Discovery said this month that the impact from the labor disputes would reduce its adjusted earnings for the year by $300 million to $500 million. Additionally, share prices for other major media companies such as Disney and Paramount have taken a hit in recent months.
The industry took a meaningful step toward stabilization Sunday night, though, with the tentative deal between the writers and studios all but ending a 146-day strike.
The deal still needs to be approved by union leadership and ratified by rank-and-file screenwriters. “I’m waiting impatiently to see what the exact language is around AI,” said Joseph Vinciguerra, a Writers Guild member and a professor at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts.
The approval vote by union leadership is expected on Tuesday.
Although the fine print of the terms has not been released, the agreement has much of what the writers had demanded, including increases in compensation for streaming content, concessions from studios on minimum staffing for television shows and guarantees that artificial intelligence technology will not encroach on writers’ credits and compensation.
“We can say, with great pride, that this deal is exceptional — with meaningful gains and protections for writers in every sector of the membership,” the Writers Guild’s negotiating committee said in an email to members.
On Monday, President Joe Biden released a statement applauding the deal, saying it would “allow writers to return to the important work of telling the stories of our nation, our world — and of all of us.”
The prospective writers’ deal should provide a blueprint for the actors, since many of their demands are similar.
Union leaders for the actors said their compensation levels, as well as their working conditions, were worsened by the rise of streaming. Like screenwriters, actors have been terrified by the prospects of artificial intelligence. They are worried that it could be used to create digital replicas of their likenesses — or that performances could be digitally altered — without payment or approval, and are seeking significant guardrails to protect against that.
The actors, however, have had several demands that the studios balked at, including a revenue sharing agreement for successful streaming shows. The actors have also asked for significant wage increases, including an 11% raise in the first year of a new contract. The studios last proposed a 5% raise.
Although the entertainment industry had been bracing for a work stoppage by the writers going back to the beginning of the year, the actors’ uncharacteristic resolve this past summer caught studio executives off guard.
The actors last went on strike in 1980. By comparison, the writers previously walked out in 2007 for 100 days.
The first worrying sign came in June when more than 60,000 actors authorized a walkout with 98% of the vote — a margin that even eclipsed the writers’ strike authorization. Then, as bargaining began, the studios saw the actors’ list of demands. Union leaders handed over a list that totaled 48 pages, nearly triple the size of their asks during the last contract negotiations in 2020.
While bargaining was going on, more than 1,000 actors, including Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence and Ben Stiller, signed a letter to guild leadership saying that “we are prepared to strike.” The union called for a strike a little more than two weeks later.

The Musician Who Energized Jazz in New York: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The East Village venue wasn't just a performance space -- it was Rivers's home. On the saxophonist's centennial, Jason Moran and other artists celebrate his legacy.
A handful of New York venues can be credited with generating era-defining scenes. In the 1970s, CBGB, perhaps the best known, was just a stone's throw from Studio Rivbea, a dingy and miraculous little performance space -- and a key energy center for the decade's revolutionary jazz. It was also the home of the saxophonist Sam Rivers, his wife, Bea, and their children. The family would greet you at the door, take your $ 4 and send you down a creaky wooden staircase to the basement, where the adventure would begin.
"It was a mecca," said the bassist and downtown guru William Parker. "It was a time of self-determination and musicians doing for themselves. Sam wasn't working the clubs, so he created his own space."
Born Sept. 25, 1923 -- a century ago next week -- Rivers was both traditionalist and avant-gardist, a Promethean improviser and prolific composer, an entrepreneur and scene maker wherever he went. He played with Billie Holiday and Jimi Hendrix, Miles Davis and Cecil Taylor, T-Bone Walker and Joe Cocker, not to mention the conductor Seiji Ozawa. In the early '70s, a time of fervent underground jazz innovation, artist-run jazz lofts, as they were known, cropped up all over Lower Manhattan. Studio Rivbea, on a forlorn block in the East Village, was formative. The music could go on all night -- band after band, a maelstrom of righteous sound that defined the era.
"The copycats make money, but they're not the ones making their own vistas," Rivers said in a 1999 interview. "I'm into making vistas."
Rivers died in 2011 at age 88, but his D.I.Y. jazz loft remains a model for a new generation of independently minded artists: "It's the future of where we need to go as musicians if we want to keep evolving," said the pianist Jason Moran, who runs his own record label and will perform inside a re-creation of Rivbea that he commissioned at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in November.
Recording and touring with Rivers in the early aughts, Moran was "ushered to the next level," he said. He links Rivers's early '70s innovations at Rivbea to the hip-hop experiments of DJ Kool Herc in the Bronx. They represent two sides of "the Black freedom struggle that was happening in the city at that same moment, with musicians going off grid and getting free, making music for the people," he said. "That's how revolutions start and then reverberate."
Rivers's revolution is being celebrated anew. A year ago, Rick Lopez, a music researcher in Erie, Pa., published "The Sam Rivers Sessionography: A Work in Progress," an astonishing 768-page tome. A book on Rivbea by the jazz writer Ed Hazell is in the works. And Rivers's archives -- including more than 500 handwritten scores and over 300 audio and video recordings dating from 1957 to 2007 -- were acquired in February by the University of Pittsburgh Library System. Concerts of his music planned this month and next in Harlem, Orlando, Fla. and Los Angeles will commemorate Rivers's centennial and remind listeners of his powerful accomplishments.
"It's Sam's time," said the tuba player Joseph Daley, who worked with the saxophonist for close to 30 years. Daley, who used to jog miles every day to stay in shape for Rivers's marathon performances, recalled a big band concert in Mount Morris Park in Harlem: "The rain was pouring down and the stage wasn't covered, but Sam just kept going and going and going. Oh, it was one of the most glorious concerts -- and Sam was playing the hell out of his instrument." He likened his friend's improvisations to "a serpent, sliding through the environment."
Rivers was born on the road, in El Reno, Okla., while his mother (a pianist) and father (a gospel singer) toured with the Silvertone Quintet. In 1947, after a stint in the Navy, he enrolled at the Boston Conservatory. Deep into the local jazz scene, he studied composition, attended a lecture by Igor Stravinsky, and connected with the drummer Tony Williams, a child prodigy who was 13 when he joined Rivers in an experimental trio in 1959. (The renowned Williams would later instigate Rivers's 1964 stint in Miles Davis's quintet.)
By 1964, Rivers was recording for Blue Note Records. He moved to New York in the late '60s, first settling in Harlem, and then establishing Rivbea in the East Village. It wasn't long before he landed a contract with Impulse! Records, a prestigious showcase for his latest projects.
Endlessly adaptable yet utterly unique, he inspired his minions to find their own creative voices. The bassist Dave Holland, a longtime Rivers associate and Rivbea regular, likened him to Davis: "He just kept moving, growing and trying new things, and he wasn't afraid to move away from what he'd already accomplished and leave them behind for something new."
Rivbea was located at 24 Bond Street, in a building owned by Robert De Niro's mother, the poet and painter Virginia Admiral. Bea Rivers (for whom Rivers composed his enduring ballad "Beatrice") managed the place when her husband was on the road and served up platters of fragrant chicken. The loft "had a homey vibe," said Hazell, the author. "The furniture was all secondhand; it was like being in their living room -- relaxed, relatable."
It became a nexus of the Black creative arts scene: Davis might stroll in, or Ntozake Shange, who workshopped her Broadway-bound "For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf" at Rivbea. Patti Smith was around, too; her friend Robert Mapplethorpe, the photographer, had a studio on the building's fourth floor. At showtime, fans would gather in the basement, where it could get as hot as a blast furnace. A large parachute -- Rivers had picked it up at a military surplus store on Canal Street -- hung from the ceiling.
Around 10 or 11 p.m., the musicians would wander in and the performance would begin. The entry fee could get you three or more bands per night, typically led by budding stars of the avant-garde: Parker, David Murray, Henry Threadgill, Oliver Lake. They were all booked by Rivers, who funded Rivbea with grant money and played there regularly with his own groups: sextets, woodwind choirs, a big band.
But his trio was his calling card. Its virtuoso sets would go on for an hour or two without pause -- bracing, improvised from scratch, yet sounding like a seamless conversation, encompassing breakneck swing, funk vamps and free-form blowouts. It was a visual treat, too. Rivers, in his big floppy hat and colorful dashiki, would go full tilt on tenor saxophone, then soprano sax, flute and piano, hooting and screaming as he switched instruments.
Rivbea closed in 1978: The building flooded and rents were rising. But later, during his four years on the road with Dizzy Gillespie, Rivers stopped in Orlando, where local music pros urged him to settle down. Hundreds of musicians were working at Disney World or doing corporate gigs -- well-paid and bored, they were thirsty for a challenge.
He and Bea moved there in 1991, and when Rivers called his first big band rehearsal, the line of candidates was out the door. He hired a drummer named Anthony Cole, a nephew of Nat King Cole who also played saxophone and piano, and later a bassist named Doug Mathews, who doubled on bass clarinet. The trio became the heart of Rivers's new big band, for which he composed constantly.
Moran first heard Rivers with this trio in New York, in the '90s: "I was like, What? Who are these three magicians, jumping from instrument to instrument? It was insane. And who is this man, this bold guy screaming into the microphone with his saxophone and voice?"
Within a few years, Moran and Rivers were touring -- "a life-changing experience," Moran said. Rivers didn't tell him what to do, but, by example, he showed him a way to be in the world. Rivers was around 80, but his energy was off the charts. He would leap three feet onto a stage. He was always "ready to make it happen -- and he was ready to do it again if he didn't like what he did the first time," Moran said. "It set me up to play with people who are completely singular."
Moran's own trio, the Bandwagon, developed much of its distinct language and flow while touring with Rivers. Spending time with "this bold guy" was liberating, Moran said.
"He literally made the lane that I'm riding in."

As Young People Stream Away, Networks Bet on Boomer Taste: [National Desk]

Full text: This coming week, as the network fall television season gets underway, ABC will begin airing "The Golden Bachelor," a spinoff of "The Bachelor" that centers on an offbeat twist: The main contestant is a 72-year-old man, and the 22 women vying for his affection range in age from 60 to 75.
On Sunday nights, the network will carve out three hours for "The Wonderful World of Disney," a television tradition that dates back to the 1950s. On Tuesdays, there's "Dancing With the Stars." On Wednesdays, there will be special prime-time episodes of decades-old standbys like "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!"
It's no secret that network television ratings have plummeted in recent years as viewers have fled prime-time lineups in favor of stream-at-your-leisure outlets like Netflix and Hulu.
But there's one notable exception, a segment of the audience that has effectively become the broadcast networks' core constituency: people over 60.
The median age of viewers at ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox has ballooned in recent years. That has left executives looking for ways to acknowledge and nurture an audience that still reliably flips on the television and watches in prime time, the old-fashioned way.
"Boomers are keeping it afloat," Kevin Reilly, a veteran programming executive who held top jobs at Fox and NBC, said of network TV. The generation, he said, "grew up with organizing their worldview around it -- the TV was the center of the living room, and we watched day-and-date."
This is a critical time for the networks. They are a shell of what they used to be, and no longer the reliable hit factories and cultural forces of yesteryear.
Hollywood's writers' and actors' strikes have only made matters worse. The strikes have grounded production for months, forcing the networks to program a piecemeal lineup of reality series, sports, games shows and repeats for the next several months.
Entertainment executives are privately fretting about a ratings collapse -- not to mention further migration to streaming -- without the vital aid of new scripted original programs.
Just nine years ago, the median age of most top-rated network entertainment shows ranged from the mid-40s to early 50s -- it was 45 for the sitcom "How I Met Your Mother" and 52 for "The Big Bang Theory," according to Nielsen. Some shows, like "Brooklyn Nine-Nine," had a median viewer as young as 39.
But in the most recent network television season, which ended in May, the median viewer was older than 60 for most entertainment shows, including "The Voice" (64.8), "The Masked Singer" (60.6), "Grey's Anatomy" (64.1) and "Young Sheldon" ("65+," the highest range that Nielsen provides).
Local television stations have seen similar trends.
"There is a quite distinct generational divide for local broadcast viewing at the age of 45," according to a recent report from TVREV, a research group. "Generation X and boomers (those 45+) still cling to TV habits they developed as kids, while their kids largely reject local linear broadcast."
Executives said in interviews that the median age for many of these series was younger when their viewership was measured on the networks' affiliated streaming services like Hulu, Peacock and Paramount+. Some shows have median ages that are 20 or 25 years younger than they are on broadcast, they said. The ABC hit "Abbott Elementary," which has a viewer median age of 60.5 on broadcast, is also popular with younger viewers when it is streamed on Hulu.
Some executives also point out that younger viewers are not adequately measured by existing viewership tools.
"Anyone we're not capturing on a linear device we are capturing on streaming," said Radha Subramanyam, the chief research officer for CBS.
Still, she added: "At CBS, we love older viewers. They watch a lot of television. And advertisers love them because they have tons and tons of spending power."
Even so, advertisers still value television audiences under the age of 50. David Zaslav, the Warner Bros. Discovery chief executive, said this month that as much as 75 percent of the audience of his cable networks was over 54 and that, as a result, the company was not making as much as it could from advertising.
Dick Wolf, a leading purveyor of procedurals, one of television's classic genres, is a big presence for CBS's usual lineup ("FBI," "FBI: Most Wanted," "FBI: International") as well as NBC's ("Law & Order: SVU," "Chicago Med," "Chicago Fire," "Chicago P.D."). Last year, NBC brought the original "Law & Order" back to life, starring the 82-year-old Sam Waterston.
Other scripted series also come from an earlier time, including NBC's "Quantum Leap" and "Magnum, P.I." -- which, unlike most of the network's competitors, will have new episodes this season because they were taped before the strikes. CBS is resurrecting "Matlock," a show that "The Simpsons" used to lampoon for its older fan base. (The new version of "Matlock" will star Kathy Bates and appear after "60 Minutes," sometime after the strikes are resolved.)
Last year, NBC found a surprise hit in "Night Court," the sitcom that debuted nearly four decades ago. ("Night Court" and "Quantum Leap" first appeared on the same night on NBC's schedule in 1989.) A producer for "Night Court" said this year that the courtroom for the new show was "not filled with tons of computer screens or modern trappings of life -- we really intentionally wanted 'Night Court' to feel like a place a bit frozen in time."
At ABC, executives decided to move "The Golden Bachelor" to an 8 p.m. slot on Thursdays, after the network had originally slotted it for Mondays at 10 p.m. One of the reasons: broad enthusiasm for the show as well as a strong lead-in from "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!"
"We have an affiliate lead-in that has a median age around 67 or 68, which is smack dab in the middle of that traditional sort of definition of what a baby boomer is," said Ari Goldman, the senior vice president of content strategy and scheduling at ABC Entertainment. "We're going to be leaning into that abundance of audience that we have going into prime time."
And, of course, "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" will have their own night to shine, with special prime-time celebrity editions on Wednesdays.
"These are shows that have been staples for the older audience for four or five decades -- I think 'Jeopardy!' is even going to be hitting 60 years old in some form or another this coming year," Mr. Goldman said. "These are shows that our audience has grown up with, and they're comforting and sort of throwback programming for that audience."

Full text: In Harlem, a dilapidated former rectory is transformed into an artist's sanctuary.
In 2016, an artist in need of a space in which to make two monumentally large paintings began working in a deconsecrated church in Harlem. Not long after, she began looking for somewhere to live. The developer who owned the church had previously shown her the empty neo-Gothic rectory next door: a dark, dilapidated four-story brick townhouse with crumbling decorative columns and dramatic arched windows. The property was irresistibly spacious (7,100 square feet, including a basement level), and she wanted to remain in the neighborhood, where her family had been based for over a decade. So she made an offer. "None of us," she says, referring to the team she soon assembled to help reimagine the place, "knew what we were getting into."
Some buildings are diatribes, a person trying to prove a point, and some say very little at all, but the most interesting ones are conversations: between past and present, comfort and utility, privacy and community and, most important, the building itself and its residents. Despite its water-damaged interior -- a warren of cramped bedrooms and leaky bathrooms once occupied by priests -- the artist felt strongly that the rectory, which dates to around 1907, should remain standing, as a part of the area's history. But she also aspired to give it a new life, as a welcoming, modern and light-filled home for herself and her two school-age children, with space in which to make work. And she wanted to be part of the process.
After meetings with several well-established architects left the artist feeling both daunted and uninspired, a neighbor mentioned her friends Tal Schori, now 43, and Rustam Mehta, 42. The two architects had met as third graders in Westchester County, N.Y., and founded their own New York-based practice, GRT Architects, in 2014. Their relative youth made the artist nervous -- they'd only completed a few projects -- but she was instantly excited by their use of color, their merging of contemporary and traditional elements and what she calls their "small details of invention," for example the way Schori had improvised a pixelated wavelike effect on the bathroom floor of a Brooklyn townhouse using dusty blue and sand-hued penny tiles. "A lot of architects have their vision and they want to convince the client of that," says the artist. "These guys were really interested in investigating things all together."
That shared spirit of adventure was tested quickly and often. Once the contractor's team began peeling back layers of plaster, they found that the joists were rotten and the whole interior had to be demolished. But the artist and the architects came to see this discovery, a prelude to later pandemic-related disruptions, as liberating. It freed them to create an entirely new layout, one that would perfectly express the artist's hopes for the space: on the garden level, a simple one-bedroom apartment for visiting friends and family; above it, a three-story family home with as many bedrooms and generously sized spaces for entertaining; and on the top floor, a guest suite and a 700-square-foot studio with a ceiling high enough to accommodate very large, if not quite monumental, canvases. Though they would still let the rectory's history speak on the outside, it was as if the building were inviting them to have their say, too.
Today, a New Yorker walking briskly past might not notice that the structure, set on a quiet, mostly residential block, looks different than it did a century ago. At street level, Schori and Mehta's interventions are discreet: Where they repaired the brownstone around the ogival front door, they used cement with a more reddish-brown hue, creating what Schori refers to as a map of old and new. "Sometimes," he says, "modifying a building does more to celebrate its history than perfectly restoring it." Only by looking up can you see the more dramatic changes. To flood the home's interior with light, the architects made an 18.5-foot-tall window by vertically connecting the existing easternmost windows on the second and third floors, leaving sections of their original sills intact, as if they'd been sliced through cleanly with a knife. And at the very top of the house, rather than reglazing a small, bricked-up round window, the artist decided to fill its shape with a symbol of personal significance, a signature of sorts: She had the architects commission the Italian artist Constantino Buccolieri to create a classical-inspired mosaic of the snake-haired mythological creature Medusa.
Inside, the house is the culmination of six years of meetings, emails and texts between the collaborators, a group that also included the designer Michael Kirkland, a friend of the artist's who worked with the team on the home's interior decoration. And as a result -- though it incorporates various contemporary design trends (a plaster fireplace and a bulbous leather Camaleonda sofa by Mario Bellini in the roughly 20-foot-high sitting room on the second floor, a terrazzo-clad guest bathtub on the fourth) -- its texture is entirely its own, a long and personal group chat come to life. The architects and artist exchanged images of rooms by the midcentury Finnish designer Alvar Aalto, which partially inspired the recurrence of simple materials like white oak and cork throughout the house. The artist shared a photograph of the painter Cy Twombly's studio in Rome, a city where she spent summers as a child, which informed the decision to cover the floor of the open-plan living area on the parlor level with geometric black-and-white tiles. The kitchen on that same floor -- a compact bay of gray and blood red stone counters and white oak cabinets tucked between a hangout zone and a dining area with a pink cast-concrete-tile-clad fireplace -- echoes the color scheme of the dressing rooms at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, from which the artist had sent a snapshot during a visit. And the final design for the staircase was influenced by pictures of the Korean artist Do Ho Suh's diaphanous sculptures of staircases, seemingly weightless sets of stainless-steel steps wrapped in sheer red polyester. The home's version, cut from white industrial steel perforated with thousands of tiny holes, similarly appears to waft weightlessly upward before disappearing into the brilliant white glow of the skylight above it.
The builder and woodworker Mark Ellison (part of a construction team that also included Adam Marelli and Bob Chan) helped engineer the staircase and created a bespoke contraption for winching heavy canvases up its center. Another collaborative innovation: the 30-foot-long string of Isamu Noguchi Akari lanterns, connected to suggest an endless column, around which the staircase winds. The idea came from the Berlin-based artist Danh Vo, one of many friends of the owner's who shared their input over the years. The Iranian German sculptor Nairy Baghramian designed amorphous rocklike bronze handles for the building's doors. ("She said, 'Your house is going to be so beautiful. I'm going to make you something really ugly,"' recalls the artist.) And the thin black bricks that pave the garden -- bordered with walls of bamboo planted by the landscape designer Laura Mac Donald, 59, the neighbor who first introduced the artist and the architects -- were inspired by similar ones produced for an exhibition by the Chicago-based artist Theaster Gates; he shared his recipe and the name of his manufacturer in North Carolina. "On a project of this scale," says Schori, "multiple voices enrich it."
Nowhere is that chorus more audible than in the lounge on the second floor. The primary bedroom, just down the hall, is purposefully quiet but for a patchwork curtain by the California-based artist Adam Pogue. (Schori subscribes to what he interprets as the architect Frank Lloyd Wright's belief that a bedroom is, essentially, where a person goes to die for eight hours.) And the two narrow kids' rooms, one flight up, are minimalist, with angular plywood furniture sourced by Kirkland from the Brooklyn studio Lichen. But the lounge, illuminated by the towering double-height window, is a vibrant union of disparate influences. Contemporary pieces, including a globular powder blue cast-concrete coffee table by the Brooklyn-based designer Misha Kahn, harmonize with personal relics, such as a room-spanning burgundy Persian rug from the apartment where the artist's family stayed in Rome during her childhood, and classic pieces of postmodern design like a black egg cup-shaped Ettore Sottsass side table. And hanging from the cream-painted walls are works from the artist's collection: a majestic hot pink-accented abstract canvas by the painter Sojourner Truth Parsons; a hazy midnight blue screen print of a woman's face by the photographer Lorna Simpson; a lithograph by the painter Jasper Johns depicting his friend the choreographer Merce Cunningham. Where the paintings end, halfway up the room's height, the plaster gives way to reedlike white oak cladding that runs up the ceiling and across an undulating mezzanine balcony -- on its railing, the narrow bands of wood take up a syncopated rhythm of alternating short and long bars, conjuring the pipes of a marimba or, maybe, a church organ. If the most interesting houses to live in are conversations, perhaps the most joyful ones are songs. Now the home of an artist, the circa 1907 building in New York's Harlem was once a rectory. Opposite: a view of the double-height living room from the curved balcony on the third floor. The artwork is by Lorna Simpson, the Camaleonda sofa is by Mario Bellini for B&B Italia, the table was custom commissioned from Misha Kahn and the pendant light is by Michael Anastassiades.; In the dining room, Glenn Ligon's "Cancellation Proofs" (2003) flank "Trangegone (Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue)" (2008) by Frank Bowling.

Opposite: a group of charcoal drawings by Miriam Cahn, Paul Pfeiffer's "Leg on Branch" (2021) and a vase by Leah Panlilio abut a fireplace clad in custom-fluted tiles designed by GRT Architects.; In the primary bedroom, a quilted curtain by Adam Pogue, a bed with a Savoir coverlet, a lounge chair upholstered in Dedar fabric and a 19th-century Azerbaijani rug from the owner's collection. Opposite: in the primary bathroom, walls finished in Tadelakt plaster, a floor with M. Crow tiles and a Water Monopoly bathtub.

TV Networks’ Last Best Hope: Boomers

Full text: Enlarge this image.
This coming week, as the network fall television season gets underway, ABC will begin airing “The Golden Bachelor,” a spinoff of “The Bachelor” that centers on an offbeat twist: The main contestant is a 72-year-old man, and the 22 women vying for his affection range in age from 60 to 75.
On Sunday nights, the network will carve out three hours for “The Wonderful World of Disney,” a television tradition that dates to the 1950s. On Tuesdays, there’s “Dancing With the Stars.” On Wednesdays, there will be special prime-time episodes of decades-old standbys such as “Wheel of Fortune" and “Jeopardy!”
It’s no secret that network television ratings have plummeted in recent years as viewers have fled prime-time lineups in favor of stream-at-your-leisure outlets such as Netflix and Hulu.
But there’s one notable exception, a segment of the audience that has effectively become the broadcast networks’ core constituency: people older than 60.
The median age of viewers at ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox has jumped in recent years. That has left executives looking for ways to acknowledge and nurture an audience that still reliably flips on the television and watches in prime time, the old-fashioned way.
“Boomers are keeping it afloat,” Kevin Reilly, a veteran programming executive who held top jobs at Fox and NBC, said of network TV. The generation, he said, “grew up with organizing their worldview around it — the TV was the center of the living room, and we watched day-and-date.”
This is a critical time for the networks. They are a shell of what they used to be, and no longer the reliable hit factories and cultural forces of yesteryear.
Hollywood’s writers and actors strikes have only made matters worse. The strikes have grounded production for months, forcing the networks to program a piecemeal lineup of reality series, sports, games shows and repeats for the next several months.
Entertainment executives are privately fretting about a ratings collapse — not to mention further migration to streaming — without the vital aid of new scripted original programs.
Just nine years ago, the median age of most top-rated network entertainment shows ranged from the mid-40s to early 50s — it was 45 for the sitcom “How I Met Your Mother” and 52 for “The Big Bang Theory,” according to Nielsen. Some shows, including “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” had a median viewer as young as 39.
But in the most recent network television season, which ended in May, the median viewer was older than 60 for most entertainment shows, including “The Voice” (64.8), “The Masked Singer” (60.6), “Grey’s Anatomy” (64.1) and “Young Sheldon” (“65+,” the highest range that Nielsen provides).
Local television stations have seen similar trends.
“There is a quite distinct generational divide for local broadcast viewing at the age of 45,” according to a recent report from TVREV, a research group. “Generation X and boomers (those 45+) still cling to TV habits they developed as kids, while their kids largely reject local linear broadcast.”
Executives said in interviews that the median age for many of these series was younger when their viewership was measured on the networks’ affiliated streaming services such as Hulu, Peacock and Paramount+. Some shows have median ages that are 20 or 25 years younger than they are on broadcast, they said. The ABC hit “Abbott Elementary,” which has a viewer median age of 60.5 on broadcast, is also popular with younger viewers when it is streamed on Hulu.
Some executives also point out that younger viewers are not adequately measured by existing viewership tools.
“Anyone we’re not capturing on a linear device we are capturing on streaming,” said Radha Subramanyam, chief research officer for CBS.
Still, she added: “At CBS, we love older viewers. They watch a lot of television. And advertisers love them because they have tons and tons of spending power.”
Even so, advertisers still value television audiences younger than 50. Warner Bros. Discovery CEO executive David Zaslav said this month that as much as 75% of the audience of his cable networks was older than 54 and that, as a result, the company was not making as much as it could from advertising.
Dick Wolf, a leading purveyor of procedurals, one of television’s classic genres, is a big presence for CBS’ usual lineup (“FBI,” “FBI: Most Wanted,” “FBI: International”), as well as NBC’s (“Law & Order: SVU,” “Chicago Med,” “Chicago Fire,” “Chicago P.D.”). Last year, NBC brought the original “Law & Order” back to life, starring 82-year-old Sam Waterston.
Other scripted series also come from an earlier time, including NBC’s “Quantum Leap” and “Magnum, P.I.” — which, unlike most of the network’s competitors, will have new episodes this season because they were taped before the strikes. CBS is resurrecting “Matlock,” a show that “The Simpsons” used to lampoon for its older fan base. (The new version of “Matlock” will star Kathy Bates and appear after “60 Minutes,” sometime after the strikes are resolved.)
Last year, NBC found a surprise hit in “Night Court,” a sitcom that debuted nearly four decades ago. (“Night Court” and “Quantum Leap” first appeared on the same night on NBC’s schedule in 1989.) A producer for “Night Court” said this year that the courtroom for the new show was “not filled with tons of computer screens or modern trappings of life — we really intentionally wanted ‘Night Court’ to feel like a place a bit frozen in time.”
At ABC, executives decided to move “The Golden Bachelor” to an 8 p.m. slot on Thursdays, after the network had originally slotted it for Mondays at 10 p.m. One of the reasons: broad enthusiasm for the show as well as a strong lead-in from “Wheel of Fortune” and “Jeopardy!”
“We have an affiliate lead-in that has a median age around 67 or 68, which is smack dab in the middle of that traditional sort of definition of what a baby boomer is,” said Ari Goldman, senior vice president of content strategy and scheduling at ABC Entertainment. “We’re going to be leaning into that abundance of audience that we have going into prime time.”
And, of course, “Wheel of Fortune” and “Jeopardy!” will have their own night to shine, with special prime-time celebrity editions on Wednesdays.
“These are shows that have been staples for the older audience for four or five decades — I think ‘Jeopardy!’ is even going to be hitting 60 years old in some form or another this coming year,” Goldman said. “These are shows that our audience has grown up with, and they’re comforting and sort of throwback programming for that audience.”

After Murdoch Succession, Empire's Future Is Unclear: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: He solidified his rise to the top of his father's media empire on Thursday.
Lachlan Murdoch's path to succession has been rocky at times, but he is finally getting the family prize: sole possession of the keys to his father's media empire.
Mr. Murdoch, the elder son of Rupert Murdoch, solidified his rise to the top on Thursday when his father, 92, announced that he would retire from the boards of Fox Corporation and News Corporation. They are among the most influential media businesses in the world, with publications and news channels in Europe and the United States that have pushed politics on both continents decidedly to the right for more than three decades.
The move leaves Lachlan Murdoch, 52, as the executive in charge of all day-to-day operations at the companies, whose holdings include Fox broadcasting, Fox News and The Wall Street Journal.
The younger Mr. Murdoch is less overtly political than his father; some confidants say he is more interested in negotiating a potential merger than he is in talking to a president or a senator. But as the heir apparent for the past few years, Mr. Murdoch has made significant efforts to prove he is committed to the future of the businesses and aligned with his conservative father politically, and is certain to continue Fox News's right-wing stance.
He has defended Fox News's programming and was the chief executive of its parent company as it continually broadcast conspiracy theories and falsehoods pushed by President Donald J. Trump and his allies about the 2020 presidential election. His views have on occasion been further to the right than his father's, claimed a former News Corp Australia editor, Chris Mitchell, in a recent memoir.
Rupert Murdoch indicated in a note to employees on Thursday that he expected his son to continue the conservative editorial stance that Fox News is known for.
"The battle for the freedom of speech and, ultimately, the freedom of thought has never been more intense," he wrote. "My father firmly believed in freedom, and Lachlan is absolutely committed to the cause."
Perhaps one of the biggest differences between Lachlan Murdoch and his father is his location. Since 2021, he has lived in Sydney, Australia, nearly 10,000 miles from the companies' New York headquarters. His commutes to the United States on the corporate jet have already proved tiring for him, a person inside News Corp said, and he often has to take phone calls in the middle of the night because of the time difference.
Lachlan and Rupert Murdoch, through a company spokesman, declined to be interviewed for this article.
Lachlan Murdoch, the third of his father's six children, was born in London and raised mostly in New York, attending private schools and boarding schools. After he graduated from Princeton, where he studied philosophy, he decamped to Australia and, like his father, spent time in the family's newspaper business.
In his 20s, he rose through the ranks to run News Corp's Australia business, happily proclaiming that he loved the Australian way of life and that it was where he felt "most myself," according to a profile in New York magazine. He also pushed the company to make a pivotal investment in a small online real estate business, REA Group, a stake now worth billions of dollars.
That period, though, was also marked by a couple of early business failures, including One.Tel, a telecommunications venture with his friend James Packer, an Australian billionaire, that collapsed in 2001.
In 2000, Mr. Murdoch was made deputy chief operating officer of News Corp and moved with his new wife, the British Australian model Sarah Murdoch, to New York. But when it became clear to him that his father was siding with Roger E. Ailes, the chief executive of Fox News, he left the company and even the country.
The attention over who would take over the company turned to his younger brother, James, who was running British Sky Broadcasting, which was part-owned by the Murdochs.
Lachlan Murdoch returned to Australia with his family and spent the next decade outside the News Corp bubble. He founded a private investment company, Illyria, buying stakes in media businesses including a network of Australian radio stations.
By 2014, Mr. Murdoch had been persuaded by his father to return to the family business, moving to Los Angeles. He became a nonexecutive co-chairman of News Corp and 21st Century Fox, in a move that signaled he was back in the mix. After his father sold the bulk of his empire, including 21st Century Fox, to Disney for nearly $ 72 billion in 2019, Mr. Murdoch was named chief executive of the new Fox Corporation, the parent company of Fox News, cementing his place in Rupert Murdoch's succession plan.
His brother, who frequently donated to liberal causes, had become increasingly concerned about Fox News's politics and sought to cut all ties from the businesses. In 2020, James Murdoch resigned from the board of News Corp with a letter noting "disagreements over certain editorial content published by the company's news outlets and certain other strategic decisions."
Lachlan Murdoch's tenure atop Fox Corp has been rocky. Fox News's persistent broadcasting of conspiracy theories about vote-rigging in the 2020 election earned it numerous defamation lawsuits. In April, Fox settled with Dominion Voting Systems for $ 787.5 million, a case that generated an avalanche of negative publicity for Fox and resulted in the ouster of one of its most popular hosts, Tucker Carlson. The company still faces shareholder lawsuits and another blockbuster defamation case.
Mr. Murdoch will soon lose his trusted lieutenant Viet Dinh, a close friend who served as Fox's chief legal officer and presided over the Dominion suit. Mr. Dinh's departure was announced in August.
And the media business isn't what it used to be. Television viewers are switching to streaming, upending the economics of the industry, while many of the print publications in Mr. Murdoch's News Corp portfolio face declining circulation and a tough advertising market.
"Fox Corp -- like other TV network groups -- is grappling with existential questions about the viability of the cable bundle and the challenges in monetizing streaming assets," said Paul Verna, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence.
"That said," he added, "given the strong ideological affinities between Lachlan Murdoch and his father, and given the elder Murdoch's advisory role as chairman emeritus, I don't expect a noticeable shift in the company's editorial positioning or strategic direction."
Paddy Manning, the author of "The Successor," a biography of Mr. Murdoch, said he had been "firmly in charge" at Fox Corporation for some time now, and had some proven successes, including the purchase of the successful streaming service Tubi.
"Rupert's retirement and handover to Lachlan is a clear signal to the rest of his family, the directors and shareholders of both companies, as well as the wider world," Mr. Manning said, "that Lachlan is the chosen successor and he has complete confidence in his leadership."

The Only Way College Sports Can Begin to Make Sense Again: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: College sports are in a state of upheaval. As of 2025, the century-old Pacific-12 Conference will no longer exist for all intents and purposes, as U.C.L.A., U.S.C., the University of Washington and the University of Oregon have decamped for bigger paychecks from the Big Ten Conference, and Stanford and the University of California, Berkeley, will henceforth compete in the now ironically named Atlantic Coast Conference.
Adjustments like these are not entirely new. Before the University of Nebraska joined the Big Ten in 2011, it was a member of the Western Interstate University Football Association, the Big Eight (once briefly known as the Big Six and then the Big Seven), and the Big 12 Conference. But these changes used to be about regional or academic affinity. The recent creation of new national super conferences, however, is about one thing: getting the biggest television audience -- and the biggest payout.
This past year, the Big Ten signed a seven-year, $ 7 billion contract with CBS, NBC and Fox. Football was already a huge business for many large state universities. But now that TV executives with no interest in academics are influencing these decisions, conferences that were once schools of similar academic value and region have been dragged into direct competition, regardless of the impact it has on student athletes.
This is a money grab, and a shameful time for all of us involved in college athletics and higher education. As regents, trustees, presidents and athletic directors, we promised to focus on our universities as academic institutions first and sponsors of intercollegiate athletics second. We failed.
The problem has been the lack of direction and vision from the so-called grown-ups in the room -- the National Collegiate Athletic Association. For decades, N.C.A.A. member institutions have spent their valuable time arguing (and losing) before courts and pleading on Capitol Hill for special protections of their "amateur" model, in which student athletes play their sport purely for the enjoyment of the activity, all while their coaches and administrators make millions.
Most recently, the N.C.A.A. and its members spent years trying to prevent two changes to the collegiate athletics model. One was the allowance of name, image and likeness compensation, which is essentially the ability of student athletes to engage in and be paid for outside advertising deals. The other was the widespread use by football and basketball players of the transfer portal, a website that allows student athletes to announce their interest in switching to another college so that coaches from other institutions can reach out, as they sometimes do in mere minutes. The N.C.A.A. says both changes do grave harm to the beloved model.
While Charlie Baker, the N.C.A.A.'s president, lobbies for one unpassable bill after another, his supporters repeat talking points about how the enterprise that has mismanaged college sports for generations should be saved for the good of American society and the academic mission of universities. At the same time, the Big Ten Conference, flush with millions of dollars of new TV revenue, helped destroy the Pacific-12 Conference, a more than 100-year-old institution and for years its "sister conference."
There is nothing amateur about a model that negotiates billion-dollar deals and pays its coaches and administrators millions while denying athletes the ability to share in the revenue or even to have a voice in determining whether these deals are a good idea. The Southeastern Conference just agreed to a 10-year, $ 300-million-per-year deal with Disney, which owns ESPN, for its TV rights. This hypocrisy is too much to bear.
The steps that universities like mine -- large institutions with prominent athletic departments and football programs -- should take are clear: First, they should meet to consider how a revenue-sharing model would work within the current structure of the N.C.A.A., and release their plan for how to grant players employee or quasi-employee status. Second, if the N.C.A.A. is unwilling or unable to help schools through this dramatic transition, they should leave and found their own organization, similar to how the English Premier League broke away from the rest of English soccer in 1992. They can create a more efficient model with a sustainable infrastructure to protect the interests of student athletes.
College football teams get chartered planes and nice hotels. But for Olympic sports like field hockey, track and field, and crew, which most athletes play, flying commercial is the norm. For a University of Michigan team to travel to a game at the University of Oregon, for example, requires over seven and a half hours of travel on Delta Air Lines, with a layover in Salt Lake City or Seattle. That's longer than a flight from Detroit to London. As part of the Big Ten Conference, a Rutgers volleyball player might fly more than 2,800 miles to compete in a game at the University of Washington on a Tuesday, before returning for a Wednesday morning exam. Calling this amateur or college athletics is simply laughable. Many student athletes rarely have the chance to step foot in a classroom, attending their classes online and taking proctored exams in hotel ballrooms near the next game site.
The only way any of it can begin to make sense is if players get a percentage of the money that conferences make off that labor.
There are a number of ways it could happen. For example, all student athletes at the University of Michigan would become employees or independent contractors of the Big Ten Conference, and would receive a percentage of the $ 59 million or so each member school makes per year from TV rights. Another model would involve the networks directly engaging in name, image and likeness deals with student athletes from major conferences, allowing these student athletes to make a guaranteed income without increasing their time commitment significantly. Say the Big Ten required its TV partners to share 30 percent of its revenues with its student athletes, each athlete would receive a percentage of that. At Michigan, where roughly 900 athletes compete in Ann Arbor, that would mean a wide receiver or field hockey player would get approximately $ 20,000 per year.
In early August, during the latest round of Big Ten expansion, I heard from leaders from across other power conferences -- from university presidents to athletic directors and coaches -- several of whom agreed with a plan for revenue sharing. Two current Big Ten Football coaches, Iowa's head coach, Kirk Ferentz, and Michigan's coach, Jim Harbaugh, have already expressed support for revenue sharing. It's time for leaders who agree privately to help create a critical mass of support. The N.C.A.A.'s rules on revenue sharing are driven by their members; this change will not come from the N.C.A.A.'s home base of Indianapolis, but from leaders at member institutions speaking frankly about the challenges to come. It must also take into account the input of student athletes, who are too often shut out of decisions that directly affect them.
Make no mistake, the courts are judging the Big Ten Conference, and the other major N.C.A.A. conferences, on their behavior. As Justice Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court wrote in a concurring opinion to the landmark 2021 N.C.A.A. v. Alston decision, "[n]owhere else in America can businesses get away with agreeing not to pay their workers a fair market rate on the theory that their product is defined by not paying their workers a fair market rate . . . The N.C.A.A. is not above the law."

With several other cases pending, the status quo is crumbling quickly. If the governing bodies and universities do not choose to reform soon, the courts, tired of the hypocrisy, will force their hand.

The Many Mustaches Of Branagh's Poirot: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In "A Haunting in Venice," the facial hair is practically a character, and it evolves as needed, thanks to the designer who considers it "a friend."
After a long day on the set of "A Haunting in Venice," the latest Kenneth Branagh murder-mystery based on Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot stories, the hair and makeup designer Wakana Yoshihara would leave the crew, find a quiet space and sit down with the detective's prodigious mustache, a sweeping half-moon of lush gray hair and attendant soul patch.
"It was my ritual every night after the shoot," Yoshihara said recently in a video interview. "Me and the mustache sit together. Sometimes I have a conversation with the mustache. It was very therapeutic, when you get into that space. The mustache became like a friend."
Yoshihara takes facial hair very seriously. The hair and makeup designer for "Death on the Nile" (2022) and "A Haunting in Venice," opening Friday, she is responsible for creating, styling and maintaining Poirot's whiskers -- a painstaking work of craftsmanship that is perhaps the most important detail in these period films. "This mustache is serious business," the director and star Branagh said when he took on the famous role for the 2017 "Murder on the Orient Express." Yoshihara has made that business her own, and she does not take it lightly.
The first iteration of Branagh's Poirot mustache was created for "Orient Express" by the designer Carol Hemming, with whom Yoshihara worked closely as the head of the hair and makeup departments. The colossal gray swath of hair was meant to pay tribute to Poirot's military background and the vogue after World War I.
But while the mustache looked suitably grand, it was heavy and ungainly, and presented many practical difficulties for Branagh as a performer. The star (who also directed but couldn't be interviewed because of the current actors' strike) was unable to open his mouth wide or laugh heartily without the hairpiece drooping or falling out of place. "You couldn't make jokes around him on set," Yoshihara said.
When Yoshihara took over for Hemming on the sequel, "Death on the Nile," the first thing she discussed with Branagh was what they were to do about the mustache this time. "We talked about downsizing," she said. "It can be smaller but still big enough for him to have the signature of being Poirot. We took some off both sides and kind of narrowed it down so it doesn't quite cover his mouth."
For "Venice," Branagh initially wanted to grow his own mustache to Poirot length to obviate the need for the prosthetic. While the length was adequate, Yoshihara ran into problems with the styling. To get the look right, she said, "I would have to use a perm, and I can't really use a hot stick so close to his face, because I might burn him." In the end, she opted to have him shave what he'd grown, and the two went back to the usual method -- albeit with more refinements.
Yoshihara and Branagh revised the false mustache even further for "Venice," making it slightly smaller again and blonder. (The hue was meant to give Branagh a "more youthful" appearance that would stave off the impression Poirot was getting older and older between films.) She explained that Poirot was on vacation in the desert in "Nile," which gave the mustache a windswept, natural character, but in "Venice," Poirot is retired with more freedom to attend to his grooming. "We made it look like he had lots of time on his hands," she said. "It's more sculpted. It's neater. It's like Poirot has finally found his best style."
The false mustache itself is a combination of human and yak hair. The human kind "is a bit too silky" and soft, she said, but the yak addition results in a bushier, more bristly look appropriate for a mustache. The strands are meticulously woven into a thin strip of silk. When she receives that woven strip from the wigmaker, Yoshihara said, "it looks like a cave man's hair, very long, so you have to cut it and style it." Yoshihara works from a plaster model of Branagh's head to get the mustache exactly symmetrical. Then, when it's time to film, she applies it directly to Branagh's face with a special adhesive similar to super glue.
Despite the effort involved in creating and applying the prosthetic, the result should still "look natural and not made up," as if the hair were really growing on his face. Striking the right balance between naturalistic and theatrical meant dozens of screen tests with sample mustaches, each of a slightly different length, shape and shade. "You need that trial and error to know what looks wrong and what looks right," she said. On "Death on the Nile," she said, they went through so many options that they didn't ultimately decide on one until the first day of the shoot.
Branagh kept his false mustache on during the long days of shooting "Orient Express," but found it challenging to eat. "Egg yolk is the killer. Or any noodles," Yoshihara said, adding, "It took so much time to eat that on this film we decided it would be faster to just remove the mustache at lunch and reapply it after lunch. I had to hover around Ken during meals."
The prosthetic was removed by gently applying isopropyl alcohol to the adhesive. "You can get drunk just sniffing it," she said, "so you have to be very careful."
One of the biggest challenges on "Venice" was the introduction of a new enemy, one of the biggest nemeses of any hairpiece: water. At one point, Poirot is plunged underwater and thrashes about for his life. It caused Yoshihara a great deal of stress on set. She remembers the first assistant director, Martin Curry, teasing her relentlessly as they were preparing to shoot the sequence. "He was laughing at me, like, 'Wakana, the mustache will get wet! What are you going to do?"' Because the hair and the adhesive could only withstand so much wetness and still keep its shape, the crew had to minimize the number of underwater takes. "You could only shoot that two or three times, no more," she said.
Yoshihara did have backup mustaches in case her favorite suffered too much wear and tear during the shoot. But she said it was impossible to make each one exactly alike. "We used that one until we killed it," she said. "It got so floppy that we couldn't use it anymore." Of course, having developed such a close bond with the mustache, she said, watching it deteriorate wasn't easy.
"I would feel so sad when the mustache was dying," she said. "Because the mustache had a life -- and he'd had enough."

Lachlan Murdoch Takes Reins of His Father’s Empire

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Lachlan Murdoch’s path to succession has been rocky at times, but he is finally getting the family prize: sole possession of the keys to his father’s media empire.
Murdoch, the elder son of Rupert Murdoch, solidified his rise to the top Thursday when his father, 92, announced that he would retire from the boards of Fox Corp. and News Corp. They are among the most influential media businesses in the world, with publications and news channels in Europe and the United States that have pushed politics on both continents decidedly to the right for more than three decades.
The move leaves Lachlan Murdoch, 52, as the executive in charge of all day-to-day operations at the companies, whose holdings include Fox broadcasting, Fox News and The Wall Street Journal.
The younger Murdoch is less overtly political than his father; some confidants say he is more interested in negotiating a potential merger than he is in talking to a president or a senator. But as the heir apparent for the past few years, Murdoch has made significant efforts to prove he is committed to the future of the businesses and aligned with his conservative father politically, and is certain to continue Fox News’ right-wing stance.
He has defended Fox News’ programming and was the CEO of its parent company as it continually broadcast conspiracy theories and falsehoods pushed by President Donald Trump and his allies about the 2020 election. His views have on occasion been further to the right than his father’s, a former News Corp. Australia editor, Chris Mitchell, claimed in a recent memoir.
Rupert Murdoch indicated in a note to employees Thursday that he expected his son to continue the conservative editorial stance that Fox News is known for.
“The battle for the freedom of speech and, ultimately, the freedom of thought has never been more intense,” he wrote. “My father firmly believed in freedom, and Lachlan is absolutely committed to the cause.”
Perhaps one of the biggest differences between Lachlan Murdoch and his father is his location. Since 2021, he has lived in Sydney, nearly 10,000 miles from the companies’ New York headquarters. His commutes to the United States on the corporate jet have already proved tiring for him, a person inside News Corp. said, and he often has to take phone calls in the middle of the night because of the time difference.
Lachlan and Rupert Murdoch, through a company spokesperson, declined to be interviewed for this article.
Lachlan Murdoch, the third of his father’s six children, was born in London and raised mostly in New York, attending private schools and boarding schools. After he graduated from Princeton, where he studied philosophy, he decamped to Australia and, like his father, spent time in the family’s newspaper business.
In his 20s, he rose through the ranks to run News Corp.’s Australia business, happily proclaiming that he loved the Australian way of life and that it was where he felt “most myself,” according to a profile in New York Magazine. He also pushed the company to make a pivotal investment in a small online real estate business, REA Group, a stake now worth billions of dollars.
That period, however, was also marked by a couple of early business failures, including One.Tel, a telecommunications venture with his friend James Packer, an Australian billionaire, that collapsed in 2001.
In 2000, Murdoch was made deputy chief operating officer of News Corp. and moved with his new wife, British Australian model Sarah Murdoch, to New York. But when it became clear to him that his father was siding with Roger Ailes, the CEO of Fox News, he left the company and even the country.
The attention over who would take over the company turned to his younger brother, James, who was running British Sky Broadcasting, which was part-owned by the Murdochs.
Lachlan Murdoch returned to Australia with his family and spent the next decade outside the News Corp. bubble. He founded a private investment company, Illyria, buying stakes in media businesses including a network of Australian radio stations.
By 2014, Murdoch had been persuaded by his father to return to the family business, moving to Los Angeles. He became a nonexecutive co-chair of News Corp. and 21st Century Fox, in a move that signaled he was back in the mix. After his father sold the bulk of his empire, including 21st Century Fox, to Disney for nearly $72 billion in 2019, Murdoch was named CEO of the new Fox Corp., the parent company of Fox News, cementing his place in Rupert Murdoch’s succession plan.
His brother, who frequently donated to liberal causes, had become increasingly concerned about Fox News’ politics and sought to cut all ties from the businesses. In 2020, James Murdoch resigned from the board of News Corp. with a letter noting “disagreements over certain editorial content published by the company’s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.”
Lachlan Murdoch’s tenure atop Fox Corp. has been rocky. Fox News’ persistent broadcasting of conspiracy theories about vote-rigging in the 2020 election earned it numerous defamation lawsuits. In April, Fox settled with Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5 million, a case that generated an avalanche of negative publicity for Fox and resulted in the ouster of one of its most popular hosts, Tucker Carlson. The company still faces shareholder lawsuits and another blockbuster defamation case.
Murdoch will soon lose his trusted lieutenant Viet Dinh, a close friend who served as Fox’s chief legal officer and presided over the Dominion suit. Dinh’s departure was announced in August.
And the media business isn’t what it used to be. Television viewers are switching to streaming, upending the economics of the industry, while many of the print publications in Murdoch’s News Corp. portfolio face declining circulation and a tough advertising market.
“Fox Corp. — like other TV network groups — is grappling with existential questions about the viability of the cable bundle and the challenges in monetizing streaming assets,” said Paul Verna, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence.
“That said,” he added, “given the strong ideological affinities between Lachlan Murdoch and his father, and given the elder Murdoch’s advisory role as chairman emeritus, I don’t expect a noticeable shift in the company’s editorial positioning or strategic direction.”
Paddy Manning, the author of “The Successor,” a biography of Murdoch, said he had been “firmly in charge” at Fox Corp. for some time now, and had some proven successes, including the purchase of the successful streaming service Tubi.
“Rupert’s retirement and handover to Lachlan is a clear signal to the rest of his family, the directors and shareholders of both companies, as well as the wider world,” Manning said, “that Lachlan is the chosen successor and he has complete confidence in his leadership.”

Full text: A grumpy man warms to a good-natured housekeeper in this film directed by Klaus Haro.
Howard (James Cosmo), the Irish widower and retired sea captain of Klaus Haro's bittersweet drama "My Sailor, My Love," is furious that his daughter has hired a good-natured housekeeper named Annie (Brid Brennan), to disturb his seclusion. At first, the grump does his best to scare off the invader. "Never darken my door again!" he thunders old-fashionedly, as though he's subconsciously aware that the writers Kirsi Vikman and Jimmy Karlsson are drawing on centuries of love stories about savage men and civilizing women. The production designer John Hand has even worked in a nod to the rose from "Beauty and the Beast."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The curveball is that after rushing the romance (the brute is tamed in a week!), Haro shifts his attention back to the daughter, Grace (Catherine Walker), who is unfairly, but understandably, aggrieved. Her father's always treated her cruelly -- how dare he be kind to someone else?! Grace's resentment is an astute twist. Imagine Disney's singing teapot enrolling in primal scream therapy, except when Grace attends a support group for women who've given too much, she can't let out her steam.
Life, and the film's costume design, haven't been fair to Walker's self-sacrificing miserablist. (When can we stop dressing this kind of character in wan beige and headache-inducing braids?) Every one of her scenes is an indignity overemphasized by a strings and piano score that needs to ease up. The painful dynamic is credible; the dialogue not so much. Still, the actors are in full command of our empathy, especially Brennan's gray-haired caretaker who, when she cracks open her heart, seems to glow from within.

Full text: Over seven decades, the Australian-born magnate compiled an array of news outlets, book publishers, and film and television properties into a global behemoth.
Rupert Murdoch, the 92-year-old media tycoon who announced his retirement on Thursday, spent the past 70 years building a global media empire that gave him influence in journalism, politics and pop culture.
Over dozens of acquisitions, Mr. Murdoch created a media conglomerate known for the rise of the modern tabloid and conservative commentary. His tenure has not been without scandal: One of his properties in Britain folded in 2011 after a phone-hacking inquiry, and he admitted this year that Fox News had spread falsehoods about the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
Here's how Mr. Murdoch built his empire:
1950s
The Australian-born mogul ventured into media in 1952 when he inherited his family's business after the death of his father, Keith Murdoch. A 21-year-old Oxford student, he inherited The News of Adelaide, a newspaper in southern Australia with a circulation of 75,000.
1960s
Mr. Murdoch bought several local newspapers in Australia in the 1960s, including The Sunday Times in Perth and The Daily Mirror in Sydney. In 1964, he founded The Australian, a national newspaper.
In 1969, he stepped into the British media market, buying The News of the World and The Sun.
1970s
Mr. Murdoch, through his media company, News Corp, moved into the U.S. media market in 1973 with the purchase of The San Antonio Express and The San Antonio News, which he no longer owns. In 1976, he bought The New York Post, which he sold in 1988 and then reacquired in 1993.
1980s
Mr. Murdoch acquired The Times and The Sunday Times in Britain in 1981, controlling a bigger chunk of the British media market.
In 1985, he acquired 20th Century-Fox, a movie studio. By 1986, he had launched Fox, a broadcast network that would run shows that became TV classics, like "The Simpsons" and "The X-Files."
In 1986, Mr. Murdoch abruptly moved the offices of his British newspapers to a site where printing would be done with less labor-intensive technology. More than 5,000 printing and production workers who called a strike in protest were dismissed, in a bitter dispute seen as a turning point in the balance of power between unions and employers in Britain.
In 1987, News Corp bought Harper & Row, which would become HarperCollins in 1990 after it merged with William Collins, another publisher Mr. Murdoch had investments in.
In 1988, Mr. Murdoch founded Sky Television in Britain. The next year, the network started Sky News, a cable-TV news channel.
1990s
In 1995, News Corp established a broadcast company, Foxtel, in Australia. It launched Sky News Australia in 1996.
In 1996, Mr. Murdoch started the Fox News cable channel alongside Roger E. Ailes, a former media adviser for Presidents Richard M. Nixon and George H.W. Bush. Fox News became a hallmark for conservative TV commentary, bolstering the careers of hosts like Bill O'Reilly, Glenn Beck, Tucker Carlson and Megyn Kelly.
2000s
Mr. Murdoch bought Intermix media, the parent company of Myspace, for $ 580 million in 2005. Myspace, which struggled to keep up with other social media competitors, was sold six years later for $ 35 million.
In 2007, Mr. Murdoch acquired The Wall Street Journal's parent company, Dow Jones & Company, for $ 5 billion. Shortly after the acquisition, there was a leadership shuffle among The Journal's editorial staff, and its new owner pushed for more coverage of politics.
2010s
James Murdoch, one of Mr. Murdoch's sons, was named News Corp's deputy chief operating officer in 2011. That same year, he became engulfed in a phone hacking scandal that led to the shutdown of The News of the World.
In 2012, Rupert Murdoch split his newspaper business and entertainment business into two separate entities: News Corp and 20th Century Fox. He considered remerging them, but those plans were dropped this year.
In 2018, Mr. Murdoch's elder son, Lachlan Murdoch, was named chief executive of Fox Corp, the media empire's TV arm.
The Walt Disney Company acquired most of 21st Century Fox's assets in a $ 71.3 billion deal in 2019, taking over Mr. Murdoch's entertainment business. The remaining broadcast business now falls under a new entity, Fox Corp.
2020s
James Murdoch resigned from News Corp in 2020 because of "disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company's news outlets and certain other strategic decisions."
Rupert Murdoch was deposed in 2023 in Dominion Voting Systems' lawsuit over Fox News's coverage of allegations of fraud in the 2020 presidential election, and he acknowledged that the network had endorsed false statements. The network settled the landmark defamation case for $ 787.5 million in April.
In September 2023, Mr. Murdoch leaves the reins of Fox and News Corp to Lachlan Murdoch. The elder Murdoch remains chairman emeritus of the two companies.

Full text: Lies of P, from a studio targeting fans of Bloodborne, Sekiro and the Dark Souls series, traces an arduous journey to end a puppet rebellion.
To challenge the undisputed champion of souls-like video games, a genre acclaimed for its opaque stories, epic boss battles and punishing difficulty, a young South Korean studio turned to an insecure puppet who has a shaky relationship with the truth.
This version of Pinocchio, though, has a mechanical arm that can be fitted with a grappling hook to pull enemies into range or a flame-throwing device that incinerates them.
Jiwon Choi, the director of Lies of P for Round8 Studio, said his team looked for a globally recognizable character with promising lore when it began the project. "The story had everything we were seeking for Lies of P: elements of innocence and gore with dark humor and compelling characters," he wrote in an email.
FromSoftware has had a stranglehold on this style of game since it released Demon's Souls in 2009. Now labeled souls-likes, the games have become a genre unto themselves, known for frequent, cavernous lows and euphoric spikes of victory. FromSoftware's most recent iteration, last year's open-world Elden Ring, sold more than 20 million copies.
Lies of P, which officially releases on Tuesday for the PC and the past two generations of PlayStation and Xbox consoles, appears to have been inspired by other FromSoftware titles, evoking the gothic horror of Bloodborne and the laser-precise combat of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. It has received generally positive reviews but must still convince a die-hard community that it is a real souls-like and not just a wooden imitation.
Transporting ideas from Carlo Collodi's "The Adventures of Pinocchio" into the fictional city of Krat, which is inspired by the Belle Époque period, Lies of P presents a dark, lush and terrifying world. A slender shadow in Victorian dress cautiously stalks the streets of a ruined city, sword in hand. Bloody, broken figures are everywhere, and the air is soon punctuated by the shrill sounds of clashing steel.
Souls-likes live and die -- and die and die and die -- on their combat systems. Lies of P wears its Sekiro and Bloodborne inspirations on its sleeve, requiring the main character, P, to sidestep or parry enemies in frenetic battles with slim margins for error. Perfectly blocking an oncoming strike can wear down the enemies that P encounters, from rank-and-file soldier puppets to hulking bosses, leaving them vulnerable to a powerful attack.
One system that sets Lies of P apart is the ability for players to disassemble weapons into handles and blades and then fuse them in whatever combination they wish. Wielding a giant wrench attached to a saber's hilt may better fit someone's preferred fighting style. "The vast amount of freedom it offers in combat will forge a distinctive gameplay experience," Choi said.
Offering the tools to succeed is a vital component of well-crafted souls-likes, which must overwhelm players while convincing them that victory ultimately rests in their hands. Upsetting that balance can make it feel like trying to win the Daytona 500 on a unicycle.
Souls-like combat has been compared to rhythm and memorization games, where improvement requires learning how enemies fight. If an attack animation feels too random or difficult to read, a fight can come down to luck instead of skill. A game's camera angles can also be a factor, blinding a player to incoming attacks.
Round8 knows it cannot please everyone with the level of difficulty in Lies of P -- what frustrates one player captivates another -- but the initial sections of the game have been tailored, Choi says, to gently guide players. A shop and a dummy that players can use to practice parrying are placed right before the first boss, although the difficulty ramps up considerably from there.
Lies of P could come the closest of any souls-like this year to nailing FromSoftware's formula; Lords of the Fallen, which failed to shake up the genre when it was first released in 2014, is expected in a new version next month, from Hexworks and CI Games. FromSoftware, which did not respond to a request for comment, has announced an Elden Ring expansion but has not detailed any plans for a Bloodborne or Sekiro sequel. Instead, it turned to one of its oldest franchises this year by releasing Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon, a mech combat game.
Geppetto and other aspects of the Pinocchio tale -- popularized in the Disney movie from 1940 and explored by many other filmmakers -- are woven into Lies of P. In a seeming echo of Isaac Asimov's fictional laws of robotics, the game's puppets are created to serve humans and bound by a series of laws. One says puppets cannot harm humans, a rule that has clearly been broken, and another forces puppets to always tell the truth.
Yet P is different: He can lie, affecting how the game's narrative plays out. In an early encounter, an ill woman asks P to find her baby. When he does, P must decide between a hurtful truth or a compassionate lie. Choi said he hoped that aspect of the game would foster moments of reflection about what it means to be human.

A Branding Milestone in a Brown Paper Bag: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Since Bloomingdale's introduced the Big Brown Bag 50 years ago, it has become a totem of the store -- as well as a mug, an umbrella and, now, a pickleball paddle.
It has made cameos in "Friends," "Gossip Girl" and "Elf." It has been reincarnated as a cake, a Limoges porcelain box and a champagne-diamond pendant. It has been rendered in chrome-plated resin as part of a sculpture of Andy Warhol by the artist Rob Pruitt. And, as other entities in the fashion world have been airbrushed and transformed over the last five decades, its brown-kraft-paper visage has had no significant face-lifts.
It is a shopping bag -- the Big Brown Bag, from the department store Bloomingdale's -- which turns 50 this month.
To celebrate, Bloomingdale's has introduced the Big Brown Bazaar at its flagship store on 59th Street in Manhattan, which is filled with new merchandise inspired by the shopping bag, including a Big Brown pickleball paddle ( $ 98), a Big Brown journal ( $ 19.95) and a Polo Ralph Lauren sweatshirt ( $ 188) that features a bear holding a Big Brown Bag. A commemorative version of the bag, with a golden "50" and rope handles, will also be offered to store customers through October.
Introduced in 1973, the Big Brown Bag debuted amid a rebranding at Bloomingdale's that began a year earlier under Marvin Traub, then the department store's chief executive, as it celebrated a century in business.
Mr. Traub, who died in 2012, wrote in his memoir that as part of the initiative, the store's vice president of advertising and sales promotion at the time, Mary Joan Glynn, proposed a redesign of its logo and graphics. For that effort, the store tapped Massimo and Lella Vignelli, the married founders of the graphic design firm Vignelli Associates, who in 1972 had redesigned the New York City subway map. They developed a new typeface for Bloomingdale's: a modernist, sans-serif font that looked different from its earlier branding, which featured its name rendered in a swirly script that recalled a handwritten signature. Mr. Traub, in his book, wrote that Ms. Glynn named the font Bloomingtype.
Around the time the store started to use Bloomingtype, it introduced a larger size of the brown-kraft-paper shopping bags it had been giving to customers. The bigger bags were requested by the store's linens department, to better fit items like pillows and blankets. Printed on those bags were three stacked words: Big Brown Bag. Later, a Little Brown Bag was introduced for customers buying cosmetics, and after that, a Medium Brown Bag.
The bags' combination of matter-of-fact tag lines and mundane material poked at the idea of the shopping bag as a status symbol, said Emily Orr, an associate curator at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum. "The bag isn't memorable due to its fancy materials or its flashy exterior," she said, but because "it's very readable and recognizable and makes design accessible."
About two decades later, the bags were reworked to incorporate the Bloomingdale's name down their sides. But by then they had already become symbolic of the department store and the lifestyle it had come to signify: a rarefied but not inaccessible mishmash of uptown and downtown sensibility epitomized by the events hosted at the flagship store in the 1970s and '80s, which drew guests like Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis; the designers Diane von Furstenberg and Calvin Klein; and Mr. Warhol, who was known to carry around issues of Interview, the magazine he founded, in brown shopping bags from Bloomingdale's.
A Sampling of Bloomingdale's Shopping Bags
"If you recognized the bag you were in the Bloomingdale's tribe," said Debbie Millman, the chair of the master's program in branding at the School of Visual Arts and the host of the "Design Matters" podcast.
In the years since the Big Brown Bag debuted, Bloomingdale's has introduced other shopping bags made in collaboration with artists and designers as part of a series that the store started producing in the early 1960s. Those bags -- which have featured motifs by the fashion designer Franco Moschino and the interior designer Ettore Sottsass, among others -- were a way to communicate the store's cultural awareness to customers, said John C. Jay, a creative director of communications and marketing at Bloomingdale's from 1979 to 1992. Some are now in the permanent collections of the Cooper Hewitt and the New-York Historical Society.
"When a new bag hit the streets of Manhattan, immediately you would get calls," said Mr. Jay, who is now the president of global creative at Fast Retailing, a conglomerate that owns Helmut Lang and other brands. "People would say, 'Did you see that bag?"'
The Big Brown Bag and its ilk were never retired, though, and in 1995, the style was adapted into a brown PVC tote bag, which Bloomingdale's has since sold in various sizes. Other merchandise inspired by the shopping bag has included mugs, passport covers and key chains.
"People like to take a piece of the brand home with them," said Frank Berman, the executive vice president and chief marketing officer at Bloomingdale's. "We've done umbrellas -- Big Brown umbrellas -- we've done Big Brown beach chairs, we've done Big Brown towels, we've done Big Brown chocolate boxes."
There have also been special editions of the shopping bag. In 2018, Bloomingdale's created a Super Brown Bag, featuring characters from Super Mario Bros., to promote a collection the store released in collaboration with Nintendo. A year later, a version of the bag with an altered tag line -- Big Little Lies -- was introduced to promote a partnership with that television show and HBO.
"The No. 1 thing people associate with the brand is that Big Brown Bag," Mr. Berman said.
While leaving the Bloomingdale's flagship store on a Saturday afternoon in August, Liat Orshansky described the Big Brown Bag she was carrying as "classic." But there are other shopping bags that feel more luxurious, she said.
"Even though what's in here is Chanel shoes, it's not a Chanel bag," Ms. Orshansky, 47 and from Los Angeles, said.
Max Cantor, 35, who walked out of the store with a Medium and a Little Brown Bag, said he had once heard that you should never shop somewhere if you would be embarrassed to carry that store's bag. "It might be kind of snobby, but I think there's some truth to that," said Mr. Cantor, a video director in Brooklyn who has worked with The New York Times.
Gesturing to his brown shopping bags, he added, "I think this is kind of a fail-safe."

Market Sags as Investors Await the Fed's Word on Rates: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: U.S. stocks edged lower, and yields climbed on Tuesday as Wall Street waits for the Federal Reserve's latest decision on interest rates.
The S&P 500 slipped 0.2 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.3 percent. The Nasdaq composite lost 0.2 percent.
Stocks have been seesawing for weeks on uncertainty about whether the Fed is done with its market-shaking increases in interest rates. By lifting its main interest rate to the highest level in more than two decades, the Fed has helped inflation cool from its peak last year but at the cost of hurting prices for investments and damaging some corners of the economy.
The Fed began its latest meeting on interest rates Tuesday, with an announcement scheduled for Wednesday. The overwhelming expectation is for the Fed to announce no change to rates. More focus will be on updated projections Fed officials give for where they see rates heading in upcoming years.
Optimists say inflation has come down enough for the Fed to cut rates meaningfully next year, while the economy continues to hum because of a solid job market. Others say the Fed may need to keep rates higher for longer to get inflation down to its 2 percent target, while the threat of a recession still looms.
A soft landing, where inflation gets back to the Fed's target without the economy having to suffer a painful recession, "is still possible, but not probable in our view," according to Joe Davis, chief global economist and head of Vanguard's investment strategy group.
A risk remains that the Fed could misread a temporary slowdown in inflation as having accomplished its mission, which could lead to a cycle reminiscent of the late 1960s where inflation reaccelerates, the Fed raises rates and a recession eventually hits.
High rates have already hit the manufacturing and housing industries. A report Tuesday showed that homebuilders broke ground on fewer new homes in August than economists expected. The 11.3 percent drop from July's level was much worse than the 0.8 percent forecast. But activity for building permits, a possible indicator of future activity, rose more than expected.
On Wall Street, shares of Instacart climbed 12.3 percent in their first day of trading. The company raised $ 660 million in its initial public offering, which priced the stock at $ 30 per share.
It arrived on the heels of another highly anticipated I.P.O. by the chip designer Arm Holdings. The offerings could mark a warming environment for I.P.O.s, which fell off sharply after stocks tumbled last year with worries about higher interest rates. Arm jumped in its first day of trading on Thursday but has followed that with three days of losses.
The Walt Disney Co. fell 3.6 percent for one of the largest losses in the S&P 500 after it announced a big investment plan for its theme parks and cruise lines.
Shares of AutoZone slipped 1.9 percent despite the company reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The auto parts retailer said growth in its domestic commercial business was weaker than expected.
On the winning end of Wall Street was U.S. Steel, which rose 3.7 percent. It said it expected to deliver strong results for the summer, above what analysts were expecting.
Ford and General Motors held steadier after falling a day earlier, as the United Autoworkers strike against them continued. Ford rose 1.8 percent, and GM rose 1.9 percent.
Bond yields have been climbing with expectations that rates may stay higher for longer.
The price for a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude swung through the day, rising more than 1 percent at one point before ending the day down 10 cents at $ 90.48. It has climbed roughly 13 percent this year as oil-producing countries curtail some production in hopes of boosting its price.

With Actors on Strike, Directors Take Spotlight: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Since striking movie stars are not allowed to promote studio films, filmmakers unexpectedly, and in some cases uneasily, have the spotlight to themselves.
For more than half a century, a coterie of critics and filmmakers has been making the case for what's known as auteur theory: the idea that great directors are the central creative forces behind their films, shaping them just as authors shape their books.
But outside a relatively small pantheon of great filmmakers, most directors have continued to be overshadowed, at least in the public eye, by their movie stars.
The Hollywood strikes are changing that.
With striking actors forbidden by their union from promoting studio films, directors suddenly have the spotlight largely to themselves, if somewhat reluctantly. They have been the main attractions at recent film festivals in Venice, Telluride and Toronto and on press tours that were once organized around A-list movie stars.
Even star vehicles must be promoted without their stars. With Denzel Washington, one of the most recognizable names in Hollywood, and his co-star, Dakota Fanning, unable to promote the third installment of the "Equalizer" series, it fell to the director, Antoine Fuqua, to go on a one-man press tour.
"It's a strange time," Fuqua told a TV news reporter ahead of the movie's Sept. 1 premiere. "I would love to have them here."
At the Toronto International Film Festival, Q. and A. sessions after screenings typically involve actors and filmmakers, but this year, many of the directors -- including Ava DuVernay and Richard Linklater -- answered questions alone. Behind-the-scenes figures were suddenly in front of the cameras: As the red carpet at the festival opened, a staff member warned the press and onlookers not to be surprised if they didn't recognize some of the people posing for photos, assuring them that they were associated with the films.
Atom Egoyan, a Canadian filmmaker whose relationship with the Toronto festival goes back 40 years, said the focus on filmmaking over celebrity at this year's event reminded him of the festival's earlier years, before the increasing presence of studio films made high-profile Hollywood actors more of a central focus there.
"Certainly for auteur filmmakers, it's been a breath of fresh air," said Egoyan, whose latest movie, "Seven Veils," starring Amanda Seyfried, debuted in Toronto last week. "The industry is going through monumental transitions, and so this has been a nice little oasis."
And as the Venice International Film Festival closed earlier this month, the director Yorgos Lanthimos accepted the competition's top prize for his surrealist comedy "Poor Things" without any of the film's stars behind him.
"Celebrity is always going to sell more than a director," said David Gerstner, a professor of cinema studies at City University of New York. "But it is a moment in which directors are being given the opportunity to shine, to be the centerpiece. It's just unfortunate that it's under these circumstances."
It is not necessarily a comfortable position for some of the directors, amid broad social pressure to stand in solidarity with unionized writers and actors against the major entertainment studios they are at odds with.
And there are already bubbling tensions: When the union that represents Hollywood directors, the Directors Guild of America, made a deal with the studios in June, keeping them out of the labor unrest, it drew some criticism from striking screenwriters.
Caught in the middle of the studios that fund their ambitions and the actors and writers who help realize them, directors tend to tread carefully when discussing the strike.
"I can understand both sides," the director David Fincher said earlier this month at a news conference for the Venice premiere of his movie "The Killer," whose star, Michael Fassbender, was absent. "I think all we can do is encourage them to talk."
It is a particularly complicated moment for directors who are also actors or writers and hold multiple union memberships.
Bradley Cooper, who both directs and stars in "Maestro," about the conductor Leonard Bernstein, decided not to attend the film's premiere at the Venice Film Festival.
And Kenneth Branagh -- who both directs the new Agatha Christie mystery movie "A Haunting in Venice," which debuted in theaters this past weekend, and stars in it as the detective Hercule Poirot -- has decided to leave interviews about the film to behind-the-scenes figures such as a top producer, the production designer and the composer.
Between the multiple roles many artists hold, and the fact that some actors have been given permission by their union, SAG-AFTRA, to promote independent films, the landscape is a bit confusing.
"It's a little bit like the wild west," said Peter Principato, chief executive of a Hollywood management production company that represents directors, actors and writers.
People are making their own calculations, he said: Some are simply following the letter of the rules, which allows multi-hyphenates to promote movies in a director's capacity, while others are more wary of taking active roles. In some cases, he said, directors are required by their contracts to promote their films.
Of course, some directors are as much of a draw as their stars. Few directors attract as much natural interest as Martin Scorsese, whose highly anticipated, Apple-backed film "Killers of the Flower Moon" is slated for release in theaters next month, even if the movie's stars, Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, are unable to act as the magnets for press that they typically are.
And Fuqua, the director of "The Equalizer 3," has the kind of heightened profile -- thanks to a varied career creating music videos for stars like Prince and Stevie Wonder, directing successful Hollywood thrillers, and making documentaries -- that can make him a successful emissary for the film, noted Alan Nierob, a publicist for the director. Fuqua promoted the movie by speaking with "Good Morning America" about his career; with movie blogs about the trilogy; and with myriad other publications.
The strike is also testing the accepted wisdom of movie marketing. Nierob noted that the limitations around promotion had not appeared to affect the movie's release; it topped the U.S. box office its first weekend, earning just under $ 35 million. (Of course, Washington's name on a movie poster or face in a trailer may do the promotional work as well as any interview.)
But it is unusual to see directors carry so much of the promotional weight on their shoulders. With this summer's Disney horror-comedy "Haunted Mansion" unable to rely on its big-name actors -- LaKeith Stanfield, Owen Wilson, Danny DeVito and Jamie Lee Curtis among them -- its director, Justin Simien, who is also a member of the Writers Guild, went on interviews alone. "I felt pulled at the seams," he said in an interview with The New York Times.
And to promote the superhero film "Blue Beetle," which topped the box office last month, Warner Bros. sent the director Ángel Manuel Soto to England, Mexico and around the United States, including Puerto Rico, to host screenings and conduct an estimated 100 interviews.
At festivals, directors have been faced with questions that, in previous years, they would have sat back and let the actors answer.
Lanthimos, whose film "Poor Things" generated buzz at Venice both for its Oscars potential and its many boundary-pushing sex scenes, was the only person at the festival's news conference who could speak to the movie's graphic nature and how its lead actress, Emma Stone, had handled it.
"It's a shame that Emma could not be here to speak more about it, because it will be coming all from me," Lanthimos said at the news conference, where he was flanked by his cinematographer and one of his production designers. He later noted, according to Variety: "We had to be confident Emma had to have no shame about her body, nudity, engaging in those scenes, and she understood that right away."
And at the Telluride Film Festival last month, Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, the directors of "Nyad," the Netflix film about the marathon swimmer Diana Nyad, were not only without their stars, Annette Bening and Jodie Foster, but without the main subject of the movie, who also happens to be a SAG-AFTRA member.
After the film's first screening, the directors said they wished that Nyad and the movie's stars could have been there to see it, and share their own perspectives with the audience.
"It's tough to have to try to speak for them," Chin said.

Wasserman Buys Brillstein In a Change of Philosophy: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Casey Wasserman had long pledged to stay away from the traditional entertainment business, but he said a new media landscape changed his thinking.
For decades, Casey Wasserman has insisted that he would never enter the traditional entertainment business. Film and TV felt too incestuous -- his grandfather Lew Wasserman reigned as Hollywood's power broker from the 1960s to the 1990s -- and too financially challenged, he would say.
Never say never: Mr. Wasserman, 49, announced on Monday that his sports-centered conglomerate, Wasserman, had completed a deal to buy Brillstein Entertainment Partners, a Hollywood management firm and content production company. Terms were not disclosed.
Brillstein represents stars like Brad Pitt, Tiffany Haddish, Adam Sandler, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Elizabeth Olsen. The firm also represents digital creators, podcasters and professional video game players. Brillstein, which landed a major hit in 1999 with "The Sopranos" and has a hand in "Real Time With Bill Maher," recently signed a first-look deal with Paramount Television Studios and has projects in the works at Netflix, Disney and Amazon.
What changed Mr. Wasserman's mind?
"The media business is radically different than it was even five years ago, and that frankly requires us to think differently about how we represent sports and music talent," he said. "Musicians are on TikTok and athletes are on YouTube and people want to produce documentaries. The lines have blurred a lot more than I think anyone would have expected even five years ago."
He continued, "Athletes used to monetize themselves in sports, musicians in music, entertainment in entertainment space, and those lines are gone."
Wasserman, founded in 2002 as the Wasserman Media Group, has become one of the largest sports representation and marketing agencies in the world. After a failed expansion into the management of musicians in the early 2000s, Wasserman tried again in recent years and now has a large music division, representing artists and bands like Billie Eilish, Brandi Carlile, Drake and Coldplay.
Mr. Wasserman said he intended to expand Brillstein's television and film production business, perhaps by acquiring additional film and television companies. "We want to get this first step right," he said. "But this is a first step, not a last step."
Brillstein was founded in 1969 by Bernie Brillstein, a garrulous talent manager who died in 2008. With early clients like Lorne Michaels and Jim Henson, Mr. Brillstein built his firm into one of Hollywood's leading management companies. His business model -- managing stars and helping to produce television shows and movies for them -- attracted competitors, some of which (Anonymous Content, 3 Arts Entertainment) would eventually surpass Brillstein in size.
Jon Liebman, Brillstein's co-chief executive, said that Wasserman would provide the resources needed to expand, particularly in content production. "The business has become incredibly complex," Mr. Liebman said. "The days when a manager could effectively serve clients without being plugged into a larger organization are over."

U.S. Strikes Are Felt in U.K.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Many U.S. studios' blockbusters are filmed in Britain, so the walkouts by actors and screenwriters have caused thousands of U.K. film crews to lose work.
What do "Barbie," "Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning" and "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny" have in common? Besides being the summer's big-budget movies, they were made in Britain, filmed in part at some of the country's most esteemed studios.
Big Hollywood productions are a critical part of Britain's film and television industry. For years, they have brought in money, jobs and prestige, and helped make the sector a bright spot in Britain's economy. But now, that special relationship has brought difficulty.
The strikes by actors and screenwriters in the United States, which have ground much of Hollywood to a standstill, are also being strongly felt in Britain, where productions including "Deadpool 3," "Wicked" and Part 2 of "Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning" stopped filming. Throughout the late summer months, when the industry would be at its busiest to take advantage of the long days, soundstages at Pinewood, Britain's largest studios, were instead nearly empty.
Film crews, like camera workers and costume designers, are out of work after productions abruptly stopped. Bectu, the British union for workers in behind-the-scenes roles in creative industries, surveyed nearly 4,000 of its film and TV members and 80 percent said their jobs had been affected, with three-quarters not working.
"Irrespective of whether you think the studios are right or whether the unions are right, there are people who are suffering in the U.K.," said Marcus Ryder, the incoming chief executive of the Film and TV Charity, which supports workers who are struggling financially.
In August, the charity received more than 320 applications for hardship grants, compared with 37 a year earlier.
Since the first "Star Wars" movie was filmed partly in a studio in England in the mid-1970s, British film studios have been a top destination for American productions, and that impetus gathered pace in the past decade thanks to generous tax incentives and moviemakers' demand for experienced crews. More recently, Netflix, Amazon Prime and other streaming services have snapped up studio space so quickly they set off a boom in studio building.
These big-budget productions employ thousands of local workers, and pour billions into the economy. Last year, a record 6.3 billion pounds ( $ 7.8 billion) was spent on film and high-end TV productions in Britain, according to the British Film Institute. Nearly 90 percent came from American studios or other foreign productions.
The number of films or television shows delayed in Britain since mid-July, when Hollywood actors joined the writers' strike, is relatively small, maybe about a dozen, but they are the big productions that require lots of crew and support an ecosystem of visual effects companies, catering and other services.
Charlotte Sewell, an assistant costume designer living in London, was working on the "Mission: Impossible" movie when the strikes stopped production. For a few weeks, she was able to work one day a week, but now that has ended, too.
"Now my one-day week has gone, I'll be trying to find some something somewhere," she said. "I'm not sure where yet."
Ms. Sewell, who is also the chair of the Bectu committee for costume and wardrobe department workers, said she supported the strikes, and she was confident she would be able to return to "Mission: Impossible" when the disputes ended.
In the meantime, she's nervous about her finances, especially paying her next self-employment tax bill, which is due in January.
"Because I've been in the industry a long time, I suppose, mentally, I'm more equipped to deal with the downtime, but financially not," she said.
She started in the business in 1992. Back then, the film industry was in "dire straits" after a funding slump, Ms. Sewell said, but recent years have been "amazing." There has been a noticeable shift in her work toward big American productions.
"We depend so much on U.S. studio-based productions for our work," she said, because British productions have died down. "I used to work in independent film all the time. I haven't done it for years because it just isn't there."
The problems for British workers has been exacerbated by a slowdown in domestic production, said Philippa Childs, the head of Bectu. The BBC's funding from viewers, through a license fee, was frozen by the government for two years until April 2024, and other British broadcasters are struggling with a drop in advertising revenue, restricting their ability to commission new work, especially as production costs are high. At the same time, film workers have been facing a squeeze on their own budgets from stubbornly high inflation.
Bectu is supportive of SAG-AFTRA, the Hollywood union that represents actors, Ms. Childs said, in part because the issues that have provoked the U.S. walkout, like the use of artificial intelligence by studios, will "inevitably" have a big impact in Britain, too.
Most workers in the industry are freelancers, but unions say that does not mean the work is always precarious. After the pandemic lockdowns, demand for workers was high, and the industry was full of stories of people suddenly moving to other productions for better pay.
"We've gone from feast to famine," Ms. Childs said.
The ripple effects from the strikes are mostly on productions with stars who are SAG-AFTRA members -- who tend to be U.S.-based actors. But the impact is expected to grow, affecting more workers. Many parts of the British film industry are insulated from the strikes, however; domestic productions, with British actors or British union agreements, have gone on.
That could change. Equity, the British actors union, is closely watching the Hollywood negotiations ahead of contract renewals in Britain. A request for a 15 percent pay increase has been submitted to the production companies and will be followed by negotiations on working rights and conditions. Equity has a campaign called "Stop AI Stealing the Show," arguing that British law is failing to protect the rights of performers.
"We're obviously going to want what the Americans want," said Paul Fleming, the general secretary of Equity. "So we are facing the prospect of industrial unrest in the middle of next year."
For the past 13 years, Ian Ogden has worked as a grip, a crew member who moves and supports the camera. He was on reshoots for Disney's live-action remake of "Snow White" when strikes shut down filming in July.
"It's been pretty bleak ever since," he said.
Last month, Mr. Ogden said, he earned three-quarters of what he needed, and was using savings set aside for his two young children to pay for groceries. For weeks, he struggled to find new work as the productions still running tended to be smaller, not requiring as many cameras or grips, he said. Recently, he has found work on a British television production.
A member of Bectu who also holds a position in a charitable organization for grips, Mr. Ogden said, "I support the fight for rights." But he does not support the strike, he said, because it is hurting the offscreen workers who don't have the kind of financial support that Hollywood actors do.
"The people that it's affected in this country -- we're not millionaires," he said.

Maybe They're All Losing Because They All Sound the Same: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: There's a late-summer-fade quality to the Republican primary contest, as if the candidates are passively sliding into the inevitability of a Biden-Trump rematch.
Donald Trump and a variety of other people see the animating factor here as the indictments against him. "We need one more indictment to close out this election," Mr. Trump joked last month. This is also the prism through which the other candidates get discussed: that they don't criticize Mr. Trump much, especially over his indictments.
But there's a bigger and more claustrophobic reality to the fading quality of Ron DeSantis and all these other Republicans: It's as if they constructed their identities as Trump alternatives and ended up all the same.
Benjamin Wallace-Wells wrote this summer that Mr. DeSantis can sound generic next to Vivek Ramaswamy: They talk the same way about China and TikTok, about how they will use military force against the cartels in Mexico (even though this really sounds as if we will be going to war with Mexico), about the F.B.I.
Two weeks before Mr. Wallace-Wells was in Iowa watching Mr. Ramaswamy make Mr. DeSantis sound generic, I heard Mr. DeSantis and Senator Tim Scott use a similar metaphor about the border -- houses, which are being broken into -- in events 18 hours apart. If we don't control the border, it might not be our country, Mr. Scott said. We will repel the intrusion with force, Mr. DeSantis said. We will finish the wall, they said.
"That's why you see these things like weaponization of agencies, because nobody's held them accountable," Mr. DeSantis said. "I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired watching the weaponization of the D.O.J. against their political opponents, against pro-life activists," Mr. Scott said. On Day 1, Mr. DeSantis said, we'll have a new F.B.I. director. The first three things we have to do, Mr. Scott said, are fire Joe Biden, Merrick Garland and Christopher Wray. "You're going to have housecleaning at the Department of Justice," Mr. DeSantis said. "We should actually eliminate every single political appointee in all the Department of Justice," said Mr. Scott, who wants to "purge" the politicization of the department for the benefit of all Americans. They walked off the stage to the same song (Darius Rucker's cover of "Wagon Wheel").
It can be hard to remember what made Mr. Trump distinct eight years ago, because it has become the texture of our lives. The 1980s tabloid dimension of his language -- weeping mothers, blood and carnage, rot and disease in institutions, brutal action -- crushed the antiseptic piety and euphemisms of the post-Bush Republican Party. The lurid, fallen vision of American life that implicitly casts critics as naïve chumps or in on the corruption is the one we still occupy.
Now they all sound kind of like that. Politicians' impulse to shorthand and flatten major policies and controversies is eternal, but it's not just that they use similar words. The way these politicians talk takes the old, once-novel Trump themes, aggressive energy and promises and packages them into indoctrination and the administrative state.
At the event in July where Mr. DeSantis sounded so like Mr. Scott did the evening before, he was midway through a period that the campaign had signaled would be a reset. At first, speaking to a midday crowd in Iowa, Mr. DeSantis ventured onto different ground, talking about economic concerns, the cost of things, debt. But he ended up talking about woke ideology, the administrative state, Disney and all the rest. If you spend a few days in New Hampshire, seeing Mr. Ramaswamy here and Mr. DeSantis there, or the full field at something like Iowa's Lincoln Dinner, you can imagine nearly the entire Republican presidential field, hands joined, heads turning at once and saying with one voice, "End the weaponization of the Justice Department."
This dynamic might be on display in its purest form on the subject of voting and elections, in the way what Mr. Trump cares about flows through the base and becomes the starting premise of what the other candidates talk about. Mr. DeSantis runs a state with well-regarded early voting and ballot-counting practices -- one where Mr. Trump won twice, along with a bunch of down-ballot Republicans. He transformed widespread voter fraud, an (illusory) concern of Mr. Trump's, into a unit that would address (rare) instances of voter fraud and arrested a handful of people, some of whom have said they had no reason to believe they couldn't vote, to prove the point that he takes Mr. Trump's fake concerns seriously.
Practically every candidacy right now is about Mr. Trump: The protest candidates exist to oppose Mr. Trump; the alternatives basically seem constructed in the negative (Trump but nice, Trump but we've got to win the suburbs again, Trump but competent) and grown inside the Trump concerns lab. Here and there, the candidates talk about health care, education costs, the economic changes with artificial intelligence or anything that might be kitchen table -- things that exist beyond Mr. Trump's reach -- but it's amazing how little some of this stuff is emphasized beyond inflation and energy costs.
During the August debate, the Fox News moderators put something Nikki Haley said -- that trans kids playing girls' sports is "the women's issue of our time" -- to a few candidates. When they asked Ms. Haley, she barely registered her own line and led with, in what seems to be her real voice: "There's a lot of crazy, woke things happening in schools, but we've got to get these kids reading. If a child can't read by third grade, they're four times less likely to graduate high school." She can oscillate a bit, in and out of past and present iterations of the G.O.P., but as David Weigel wrote this spring, she accepts the premise of the Trump era: "I am very aware of a deep state," she told a voter who asked about her plans to dismantle it this spring. "It's not just in D.C.; it's in every one of our states."
And none of them are winning! It might be the indictments that have firmed up Mr. Trump's support, but the inescapable sameness of the candidates, especially when they should sound and seem different, is real.
The idea some conservatives had for Mr. DeSantis -- including Mr. DeSantis -- was that he would be a singular figure, uniting the people attracted to the statist aggression of Mr. Trump and the people looking to move beyond Mr. Trump. Fundamentally, this depended on the idea that Mr. DeSantis is distinct from Mr. Trump, which seems like a misunderstanding. His appeal for certain kinds of conservatives, particularly donors, depended then on a subtle trust that he would not go too far and could shift into some other plane of political operation.
But they were never distinct figures; Mr. DeSantis's rise in the party as a competent aggressor exists because of the Trump era and the things that Mr. Trump is and isn't. He makes happen what Mr. Trump talks about. And, like all the others who have defined themselves by being an alternative to an individual who is still always present, he has ended up talking about the same things and sounding the same as most of the others. Mr. Trump created the air that everyone now breathes.

Tech Titans Want to Build a New City. Can't They Just Fix What We've Already Got?: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Tech leaders are fed up with cities and their politics. So they want to start over. And that doesn't bode well for cities old or new.
We recently learned that the mysterious company gobbling up land in Solano County, Calif., is funded by venture capitalists including Marc Andreessen, Reid Hoffman and Steve Jobs's widow, Laurene Powell Jobs. Their goal: build a new city from scratch. In doing so, they are getting in a long line of technotopians that includes the Google co-founder Larry Page and his effort to build cities "from the internet up," the Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale and his plans for "charter cities" and the PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel and his desire for "Seasteader" cities floating on water. The Amazon founder Jeff Bezos wants to see cities floating in space, and Elon Musk has proposed cities in Texas and on Mars. There's even a venture capital firm funding the creation of new cities.
As a professor of urban tech who has worked in the industry for years, I've been recruited to lead some of these technotopian ventures. What I learned from these meetings keeps me focused on my day job. The tech leaders may have the money to build new cities, and they certainly have the hubris. What they lack is the disposition.
Cities and their problems have long bedeviled people in power. The technotopians are just the latest in a grand tradition of American business magnates aspiring to build their dreams -- from Pullman, Ill., to Epcot Center in Disney World. They tend to approach building cities the same way they've approached building tech start-ups. And that is unfortunate.
To state the obvious: Cities are not start-ups. They can't keep up with the tech industry's rate of innovation. That frustrates many technotopians, like the Thumbtack co-founder Jonathan Swanson, who once complained that "humans currently live in cities that are the equivalent of flip phones" -- the worst possible insult in Silicon Valley at the time.
Cities aren't like phones. They're not like computers either, a distinction that the University of Pennsylvania professor Shannon Mattern wrote an entire book to explain. Urban problems are too complex and politically fraught to be programmed into an app. Constructing a building takes much longer than constructing a website. And undoing the racist legacy of urban policies is more complicated than pushing through a software update.
Approaching complex urban problems as if they were engineering problems has led to some of the biggest mistakes in our urban history. During the urban renewal era of the mid-20th century, urban planners like Le Corbusier were so enthusiastic about the so-called "machine age" that they approached buildings and cities as if they were "machines for living." The results were mostly car-centric, soulless and segregated by use (and often by race), from Brasília to San Francisco's Fillmore neighborhood. City leaders have since spent billions working to deconstruct and reintegrate what those "machine age" planners built.
While today's technologies have made it easier to optimize urban life, they haven't helped us reach a collective agreement about what aspects of urban life deserve optimization. An overemphasis on urban technology can be a distraction from urban outcomes. For example, the frantic race to deploy autonomous vehicles on our streets appears to be more focused on perfecting the vehicles than on addressing cities' real mobility challenges. That's because technotopian proposals tend to focus on solving technology problems more than people problems. You can see this in how they pitch themselves. New technologies often outnumber people in their renderings, if people are pictured at all.
Refreshingly, the latest proposal from the technotopians in Solano County hasn't focused on the tech -- yet. Their renderings are surprisingly nostalgic for a storybook Mediterranean urbanism. But as The San Francisco Chronicle urban design critic put it, the renderings are impossible to critique, because, "what was unfurled is so innocuous as to be an insult. The images are as placid as a video aimed at infants."
Perhaps that is because this cohort of technotopians has learned from the mistakes of their peers, or because they've hired more thoughtful urbanists -- or, perhaps cynically, they're just trying to appeal to rural residents who will have to vote on the new city plan. Whatever the reason, I hope this time will be different. But with so many tech investors at the helm who are eager to pilot new technologies like flying cars, I'm not optimistic.
I get it. It's challenging to transform our existing cities and to pilot new tech solutions on our streets. Just look at the rocky rollout of e-scooters around the world. Wouldn't it be easier to test new technologies, business models and government structures in cities free of pesky people? That's certainly the aim of many technotopian plans, which call for new cities to be built, new rules to be written and new residents to opt in to being guinea pigs. Mr. Lonsdale, of Palantir, explains: "The idea is simple: found new cities, free from old bureaucratic and legal structures, and explore bold new visions of how government should work. Market them to people who choose to join and see what the world learns."
But these new cities are never really built from scratch. They usually encroach on someone else's land or run contrary to local plans. The technotopians rarely acknowledge that, which often leads to their downfall, as with Alphabet in Toronto and the Seasteaders in French Polynesia. The Solano project appears to be on a similar trajectory. They've snapped up land under a veil of secrecy, which has undermined needed political support. "If these investors plan to convince Solano residents and their elected representatives that building a new city on productive agricultural land is a wise scheme, they are off to a terrible start at earning the community's trust," John Garamendi, a Democrat who represents part of Solano County, testified at a recent State Senate committee hearing.
It's a shame the technotopians keep seeking out new territories. Our existing cities have plenty of problems to solve. And there are plenty of technologies that could help solve them. Their perpetual focus on starting from scratch is just a megalomaniac distraction.
No need to worry, you may think: Many of these places will never get built. But there's an opportunity cost to these utopian dreams. What if all the billions in venture capital money and media attention were refocused on solving real-world challenges in cities today? Could we better fix public transportation's pending fiscal cliff or the affordable housing crisis? I'm afraid we'll never know. The lure of starting from scratch is just too great.

Full text: Striking actors and writers fear A.I. Executives don't seem to. It's a longstanding battle over technology and control in Hollywood that plays out onscreen, too.
I've seen things you people wouldn't believe, to borrow a line from Ridley Scott's 1982 shocker, "Blade Runner." But I'm a movie critic, so of course I have. And one of my favorite unbelievable visions is that of walking, talking, thinking and often terrifying robots, like the kind that both thrilled and scared me in the original "Westworld" and especially "The Stepford Wives." In the 1970s, these creepfests offered a far bleaker view of our future world than the robot sidekicks in "Star Wars" that would soon overtake the culture and the film industry.
The movies have long been haunted by these fantastic machines, particularly those humanoid inventions that look unnervingly like us, be it the robot woman in Fritz Lang's "Metropolis" (1927) or the duplicitous android in Scott's "Alien" (1979), ingenious creations that are "virtually identical to a human," to borrow another quote from "Blade Runner." More recently, though, another specter -- artificial intelligence -- has by turns captivated and alarmed the world, onscreen and off. In the latest "Mission: Impossible" flick, Tom Cruise battles a sentient A.I.; in the forthcoming postapocalyptic thriller "The Creator," John David Washington plays an operative sent to retrieve an A.I. weapon that looks like an adorable kid.
I'm keeping an open mind about "The Creator" even if artificial intelligence admittedly gives me the willies. I blame Stanley Kubrick. I'm joking, sort of, but my bone-deep suspicions about A.I. haven't deviated much since the eerily affectless voice of HAL 9000, the supercomputer in Kubrick's 1968 freakout, "2001: A Space Odyssey," took up permanent residence in my head. It's HAL's calm, measured, unrelenting voice I heard when I read the May 30 statement from more than 350 leaders in A.I. "Mitigating the risk of extinction from A.I.," it read, "should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war."
By the time that warning was released, the Writers Guild of America had been on strike for four weeks, spurred to action, in part, by fears that generative A.I. would not only encroach on their livelihoods, but might also at least partly supplant them. Similar concerns drove SAG-AFTRA, the union representing some 160,000 performers and media professionals, to hit the picket line on July 14, making this the first time since 1960 that both groups are on strike. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the trade organization that negotiates on behalf of studios, has waved off union worries with bland promises that all will be fine. "We're creative companies," it asserted in May, "and we value the work of creatives."
If you snorted reading that line, you aren't alone. Given the history of the movies and, you know, capitalism, and putting aside the obnoxious use of creative as a noun, it is hard to take this assurance in good faith. The writers' worries, though, are nothing if not serious: Among other things, they don't want A.I. to be used to write or rewrite literary material or be used as source material. In July, John Lopez, who's in the union's A.I. working group, added a romantic spin to these conditions, writing in Vanity Fair that "meaning in art always comes from humans, from having something to say, from needing to connect." I'm sympathetic, but I wonder if he's ever read the transcript of a Disney earnings call.
Unsurprisingly, given that companies are already scanning actors' faces and bodies, SAG-AFTRA sounds near-apocalyptic about A.I. in the concerns it's raised: "Performers need the protection of our images and performances to prevent replacement of human performances by artificial intelligence technology." Reading this, I flashed on Andy Serkis, who's best known for voicing and providing the movements for motion-capture characters in the "Lord of the Rings" movies and in the rebooted "Planet of the Apes" series. Fans of his work in both franchises, including his "Apes" co-star James Franco, lobbied for the actor to receive Oscar recognition. "This is not animation as much as it's digital 'makeup,'" Franco wrote in Deadline, a take that industry bosses surely must have appreciated.
In cinema's earliest, wildest years, movie people did it all: writing, directing, scouting locations, acting. As motion pictures became a big business in the 1910s, efficiency became a rallying cry and then an ethos in the industry, which applied the principles of scientific management to its practices. As the production process became increasingly rationalized, sprawling studio lots were built that centralized work (and made it easier to manage workers) and specific departments (executive, wardrobe, electrical) were established, which maintained a thorough division of labor. By the 1920s, directors, writers and stars who had once exercised control over their work increasingly answered to producers and studio bosses.
Some films seemed to nod at the Hollywood factory on a representational level, including Charlie Chaplin's "Modern Times" (1936). In it, his Little Tramp works in a factory that's a model of efficiency, as evidenced by a new "feeding machine" that's meant to serve workers as they labor, increasing production and decreasing overhead. When the boss tries the feeder out on the Tramp, though, the machine goes kablooey. Not long after he returns to work, tightening bolts zipping past him on a conveyor belt, he suffers a breakdown, his motions turn frenzied and he's sucked into the machine, a still startling image of radical dehumanization.
Although some stars exerted their independence inside the system, especially those with savvy agents, the studios kept a tight rein on the majority of performers. By the early 1930s, the industry's most overt means of exerting control over its most famous workers was the option contract, usually running for seven years. Studios didn't just shape and refine the stars' images, changing their names and coordinating their public relations, they also maintained exclusive rights to the performers' services. They could drop or renew a contract, loan actors out, cast them in terrible roles as well as suspend and sue those deemed unruly.
"I could be forced to do anything the studio told me to do," Bette Davis said of Warner Bros., which signed her to a standard player's contract in 1931. Davis grew frustrated with her roles and said that her only recourse was to refuse, resistance that the company answered by suspending her without pay. "You could not even work in a five-and-dime store," Davis said. "You could only starve." She won her first best actress Oscar in 1936, but two years later, she said, she still didn't have a provision in her contract for star billing. Her fame and salary had grown, though not her power: Her third Warners contract stipulated that she had to "perform and render her services whenever, wherever and as often as the producer requested."
Directors and writers contracted by the studios similarly struggled for control and sovereignty, with the companies taking the view, as the screenwriter Devery Freeman once said, that when they hired writers they owned their ideas "forever in perpetuity. " Every studio was different, and so were the terms of labor. In 1937, the independent producer David O. Selznick ("Gone With the Wind") explained that, for the most part at M.G.M., the job of the director was "solely to get out on the stage and direct the actors, put them through the paces that are called for in the script." At Warner Bros., he continued, a director "is purely a cog in the machine" who was given the script often just a few days before going into production.
Given the tension between art and industry that characterizes much of Hollywood history, it is no surprise that the "cogs in the machine" metaphor crops up frequently in chronicles about the good old bad days. I love many classic Hollywood films (and miss their competencies), but for all its genius, the system took its toll. The outrages of sexual exploitation and racial discrimination are, in the end, simply the most grotesque and flagrant examples of how thoroughly the system could, and did, chew up its own people. "We have the players, the directors, the writers," Selznick wrote in his resignation letter to the head of Paramount in 1931. "The system that turns these people into automatons is obviously what is wrong."
Selznick's despair brings to mind one of my favorite scenes in "Blade Runner." Set in a futuristic Los Angeles, it centers on Deckard (Harrison Ford), a gruff, Bogart-esque type who hunts renegade replicants, lifelike synthetic humans that are produced as slave labor. Fairly early on, Deckard visits the Tyrell Corporation, which builds replicants, to speak to its spooky eponymous founder. "Commerce is our goal here," Tyrell says, as he explains his business with unctuous equanimity. "'More human than human' is our motto," he continues, sounding very much like an old studio boss.
As in "Blade Runner," most of the most indelible thinking machines in movies take human shape. That's the case in "Metropolis," in which a metallic robot is given the form of a living woman, as well as in films like the original "Westworld," "The Stepford Wives" and the "Terminator" franchise. Even when the A.I. doesn't have a physical body, the more memorable ones are voiced by recognizably human performers like Paul Bettany in "Iron Man" and Scarlett Johansson in "Her," Spike Jonze's improbable, improbably sweet romance about a guy (Joaquin Phoenix) and a virtual assistant, a disembodied presence that you quickly sketch in specifically because of Johansson's résumé and potent star persona.
Given that movies are largely character-driven, the human shape is no surprise. A robot that's a hunk of metal can be scary, but non-anthropomorphic machines don't resonate as powerfully as the lifelike ones that roam our screens. Alternately charming and off-putting, neither fully human nor obviously artificial, these machines function as servants, warriors, companions, toys, distractions and, invariably, unsettling mirrors. In Steven Spielberg's "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" (2001), a drama about a boy android called David (Haley Joel Osment) that -- who --yearns for his human mother's love, a character distills one crucial reason we are so unsettled by these machines: "In the beginning, didn't God create Adam to love him?"
Isaac Asimov wrote that when he was a kid, robot stories could be divided into two types: "robot-as-menace" and "robot-as-pathos." Part of the power of Spielberg's "A.I." is that its lead character's pathos is rooted in his desire for love. Yet David is also intentionally discomforting because he is at once machine and human, which makes him neither. He is, in a manner of speaking, a problem child for the couple who "adopt" him as well as for Spielberg. It's a problem that the film solves with a fairy-tale ending and some far-out robots called "specialists," willowy creations that shut David down. By then, all organic matter on Earth is dead, human beings having technologically advanced themselves right into extinction.
Intentionally or not, movies like "A.I." and "Her," "The Terminator" and "The Matrix" have been prophesying a future that suddenly seems here. Since the introduction of ChatGPT in November, the words artificial intelligence have become ubiquitous, cropping up in headlines, at congressional hearings and on picket signs brandished by writers and actors who, for good reason, are themselves concerned that they're being advanced into extinction. "A.I. is not art" has popped up on a few of the signs, though I prefer "Pay the writers you AI-holes!" It's a good line and a reminder that writers are never expendable, or at least that's what I've been silently chanting while writing about our brave new world. Siri, do you review movies?

Full text: Mortal Kombat, Super Mario Bros. and more are coming this season.
It has been such a fruitful year for video games that you couldn't blame someone for wanting a light fall lineup to finish titles like Tears of the Kingdom and Baldur's Gate 3. For better or worse, this season is stacked with AAA releases, long-awaited sequels and promising independent games. (Some games will be available before their official launch dates because of early-access programs.)
September
MORTAL KOMBAT 1 The fighting franchise that drew crowds at arcades in the early 1990s has conjured new gruesome fatalities for its second narrative reboot. A cast of familiar characters such as Scorpion, Kitana and Johnny Cage will be assisted in battle by partner fighters who leap onscreen. (Sept. 19; PC, Nintendo Switch, Sony PlayStation 5, Microsoft Xbox Series X|S)
LIES OF P This is not Disney's Pinocchio. In a retelling set in the Belle Époque era, a puppet with one mechanical arm wields rapiers and greatswords against giant monsters in his way. Success will require the meticulous combat timing of the punishing Soulslike genre, which includes Dark Souls and Elden Ring. (Sept. 19; PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S)
EL PASO, ELSEWHERE Bullet time -- à la "The Matrix" and Max Payne -- is a crucial resource for a folklore researcher who descends into a supernatural motel filled with werewolves and fallen angels to confront his lover, the vampire lord Draculae. Designed by a small studio, this third-person shooter exudes neo-noir. (Sept. 26; PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S)
CYBERPUNK 2077: PHANTOM LIBERTY Nearly three years after the buggy release of the hyped role-playing game Cyberpunk 2077, an expansion thrusts the mercenary V into a new section of Night City as a secret agent. The game's underlying perk, upgrade and loot systems also get tweaks. (Sept. 26; PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S)
EA SPORTS F.C. 24 After three decades of FIFA brand extension, this soccer game returns without the license of the sport's global governing body. Beyond the elimination of World Cup content, agreements with the Premier League, Bundesliga and others mean that little will change. Women's soccer players are also being added to Ultimate Team, the squad-building mode that has been lucrative for Electronic Arts. (Sept. 29; PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S)
COCOON The lead gameplay designer from the acclaimed indie games Limbo and Inside explores the power of recursion for his first venture at a new studio.

SUPER MARIO BROS. WONDER In their return to a two-dimensional adventure, the exuberant plumber and his friends have a more surreal experience than ever. Rather than the fire flowers that turn characters into flamethrowers, wonder flowers distort the landscape of pipes and coins. Mario can transform into a spiky ball and an elephant. (Oct. 20; Switch)
ALAN WAKE II When the author Alan Wake traveled to the Pacific Northwest in a 2010 game influenced by Stephen King and David Lynch, he became trapped in a nightmare he wrote; in this sequel, an F.B.I. agent investigating murders encounters those eerie manifestations. (Oct. 27; PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S)
November
THIRSTY SUITORS A South Asian woman reeling from a breakup works to repair relationships with her ex-boyfriends and parents through skating, cooking, romancing and fighting.

Full text: New films by Martin Scorsese, Sofia Coppola, David Fincher and Bradley Cooper lead a select list of the season's highlights.
What's the anatomy of a fall movie season? Although the writers' and actors' strikes have kept Hollywood in suspense, the calendar is, for now, still filled with exciting titles, including work from established masters (Martin Scorsese, Sofia Coppola, David Fincher) and relative breakouts like Justine Triet, the director of, well, "Anatomy of a Fall," which won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival in May. Here is a select list of features coming to theaters and streaming services beginning later this month. (Pedro Almodóvar and Wes Anderson, among other directors, are releasing shorts but those are not included.) Release dates and platforms are subject to change.
September

(Nov. 17 in theaters)

TROLLS BAND TOGETHER The Troll universe expands again as Poppy (voiced by Anna Kendrick) and Branch (Justin Timberlake) seek out Branch's brothers, with whom he previously formed a boy band.

MENUS-PLAISIRS -- LES TROISGROS After more than 40 features, the 93-year-old Frederick Wiseman is still going strong.

(Nov. 22 in theaters)
NAPOLEON Stanley Kubrick's Bonaparte biography will, alas, always be one of cinema's great what-ifs. But we are getting Ridley Scott's version of the life of the French military leader, with Joaquin Phoenix donning the bicorn. Vanessa Kirby also stars. (Nov. 22 in theaters)

CHICKEN RUN: DAWN OF THE NUGGET A teaser trailer suggests that the "nugget" in question is a newborn chick -- although the title could also refer to the invention of chicken nuggets, which would make this sequel to "Chicken Run" (2000) more of a horror film than a family feature. Thandiwe Newton, Zachary Levi and Bella Ramsey provide some of the voices. (Dec. 15 on Netflix)
WONKA While "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory" and Roald Dahl's book left many questions, how Wonka defeated a chocolate cartel to found his factory was not exactly foremost among them.

(Dec. 22 in theaters)
REBEL MOON -- PART ONE: A CHILD OF FIRE Sofia Boutella bands together misfit warriors to save the galaxy.

This is the first of two installments, with the next one due in April. (Dec. 22 on Netflix)

(Dec. 25 in theaters)

Profits to Be Made in Treacherous Darién Gap: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Every step through the jungle, there is money to be made.
The boat ride to reach the rainforest: $ 40. A guide on the treacherous route once you start walking: $ 170. A porter to carry your backpack over the muddy mountains: $ 100. A plate of chicken and rice after arduous climbing: $ 10. Special, all-inclusive packages to make the perilous slog faster and more bearable, with tents, boots and other necessities: $ 500, or more.
Hundreds of thousands of migrants are now pouring through a sliver of jungle known as the Darién Gap, the only land route to the United States from South America, in a record tide that the Biden administration and the Colombian government have vowed to stop.
But the windfall here at the edge of the continent is simply too big to pass up, and the entrepreneurs behind the migrant gold rush are not underground smugglers hiding from the authorities.
They are politicians, prominent businessmen and elected leaders, now sending thousands of migrants toward the United States in plain sight each day -- and charging millions of dollars a month for the privilege.
"We have organized everything: the boatmen, the guides, the bag carriers," said Darwin García, an elected community board member and former town councilman in Acandí, a Colombian municipality at the entrance to the jungle.
The crush of migrants willing to risk everything to make it to the United States is "the best thing that could have happened" to a poor town like his, he said.
Now, Mr. García's younger brother, Luis Fernando Martínez, the head of a local tourism association, is a leading candidate for mayor of Acandí -- defending the migration business as the only profitable industry in a place that "didn't have a defined economy before."
The Darién Gap has quickly morphed into one the Western Hemisphere's most pressing political and humanitarian crises. A trickle only a few years ago has become a flood: More than 360,000 people have already crossed the jungle in 2023, according to the Panamanian government, surpassing last year's almost unthinkable record of nearly 250,000.
In response, the United States, Colombia and Panama signed an agreement in April to "end the illicit movement of people" through the Darién Gap, a practice that "leads to death and exploitation of vulnerable people for significant profit."
Today, that profit is greater than ever, with local leaders collecting tens of millions of dollars this year alone from migrants in an enormous people-moving operation -- one that international experts say is more sophisticated than anything they have seen.
"This is a beautiful economy," said Fredy Marín, a former town councilman in the neighboring municipality of Necoclí who manages a boat company that ferries migrants on their way to the United States. He says he transports thousands of people a month, charging them $ 40 a head.
Mr. Marín is now running for mayor of Necoclí, vowing to preserve the thriving migration industry.
"What was first a problem," he said of the many migrants who began showing up in the last few years, "has become an opportunity."
American diplomats have visited the towns next to the Darién Gap in recent months, strolling dusty streets and shaking hands with Mr. Marín, Mr. García and others running the migration business. White House officials say they believe that the Colombian government is following through on its commitment to crack down on illicit migration.
But on the ground, the opposite is happening. The New York Times has spent months here in the Darién Gap and surrounding towns, and the national government has, at best, a marginal presence.
When the national authorities can be seen at all, they are often waving migrants through, or in the case of the national police, fist-bumping the men selling expensive travel packages through the jungle.
The top police official in the region, Col. William Zubieta, said it wasn't his job to halt the flow. Instead, he argued, the nation's migration authorities should be exerting control.
"Unfortunately, they do not have it," he said.
Colombia's president, Gustavo Petro, acknowledged in an interview that the national government had little control over the region, but added that it was not his goal to stop migration through the Darién anyway -- despite the agreement his government signed with the United States.
After all, he argued, the roots of this migration were "the product of poorly taken measures against Latin American peoples," particularly by the United States, pointing to Washington's sanctions against Venezuela.
He said he had no intention of sending "horses and whips" to the border to solve a problem that wasn't of his country's making.
In the absence of the Colombian government, local leaders have decided to handle migration themselves.
Today, the business is run by elected community board members like Mr. García, through a registered nonprofit started by the board's president and his family. It's called the New Light Darién Foundation, and it manages the entire route from Acandí to the border with Panama -- setting prices for the journey, collecting fees and running sprawling campsites in the middle of the jungle.
The foundation has hired more than 2,000 local guides and backpack carriers, organized in teams with numbered T-shirts of varying colors -- lime green, butter yellow, sky blue -- like members of an amateur soccer league.
Migrants pay for tiers of what the foundation calls "services," including the basic $ 170 guide and security package to the border. Then a migration "adviser" wraps two bracelets around their wrists as proof of payment.
"Like a ticket to Disney," said Renny Montilla, 25, a construction worker from Venezuela.
Mr. García says that the foundation's work is legal, in part because it guides people to an international border, but not over one.
Some officials have questioned whether the foundation is running a smuggling operation under the guise of a nonprofit. A human rights officer responsible for monitoring the Necoclí government blamed the crisis on the negligence of national leaders, and noted that officials weren't motivated to stop it because they were making money from it.
Even Mr. García's brother, the mayoral candidate, said he wished the national government would clarify the legal "thin line" that local residents working in the migration industry were walking.
"Five hundred thousand people are going to pass through" our town, Mr. Martínez said. "What do we do?"
Hanging over the entire business is a large and powerful drug-trafficking group called the Gaitanist Self-Defense Forces, sometimes known as the Gulf Clan. Its control over this part of northern Colombia is so complete that the country's ombudsman's office calls the group the region's "hegemonic" armed actor.
In a recent report, the ombudsman accused the group of exercising what it called "criminal governance" over the region, meaning that whatever happens here must have the group's blessing.
Mr. García, the community board member, acknowledged that the armed group "provides security" in the region, but insisted that the foundation was completely separate.
"I am not part of the Gulf Clan," he said.
In a statement, the armed group contended that it "in no way" profits from "the business that traffics in migrants' dreams."
Mr. Petro, the Colombian president, dismissed that notion, saying the Gulf Clan was earning $ 30 million a year from the migration business.
At the edge of the forest, the transactions are plain to see.
Before they enter the jungle, migrants have to pay the group a separate tax of about $ 80 a person for permission to cross the Darién, according to multiple people who collect the fee in Necoclí.
Once migrants have paid, they even get a receipt, the tax collectors say: a tiny sticker, often an American flag, on their passports.
Taming a Jungle
Thick, hot and prone to intense rain, sliced by raging rivers and steep mountains, the Darién jungle acted as a vast natural barrier between North and South America for generations, thwarting the flow of people north.
Guerrillas and other armed groups have long used the dense forest for cover and drug smuggling, sometimes attacking those who dared to pass. The terrain and threat of violence once kept all but the most desperate away.
But a stew of crises and politics -- like the turmoil in Venezuela, Haiti and now Ecuador, the economic devastation of the pandemic, and visa regulations that prevent many migrants from simply flying to Mexico or other countries -- has brought a huge rise in the number of people trekking from South America to the United States in the last few years.
Now, the New Light Darién Foundation is helping to turn that natural barrier into something much more passable, with restaurants, camps, porters and guides.
This new economy, run in large part by elected leaders, has acted as an accelerant, emboldening more people to take -- and pay for -- the journey than ever.
In August alone, almost 82,000 people made the trek through the Darién, according to Panamanian officials, by far the largest single-month total on record.
So many people are coming through the jungle that Panama and Costa Rica say they cannot handle the surge. Panama's top migration official, Samira Gozaine, has even threatened to close its border with Colombia.
And the political tumult stacks up all the way to the United States. After dipping briefly this year, migrant apprehensions at the American border have risen again, with a record number of families crossing.
The Colombians transporting migrants through the jungle say they are providing a humanitarian service. The migrants will try to get to the United States regardless, they say, driven by violence, poverty and political upheaval at home.
So, by professionalizing the migration business, Colombian leaders say they can prevent their impoverished towns from being overwhelmed by hundreds of thousands of needy people, help the migrants traverse the treacherous jungle more safely -- and feed their own economies in the process.
Migrant deaths in the Colombian portion of the Darién now appear to be relatively low, aid workers say, because even the Gaitanist armed group, or Gulf Clan, has realized that the Darién's notoriety is bad for business. Local officials say the group has set a policy to keep customers coming: Anyone who robs, rapes or kills a migrant will face punishment, possibly even death.
But the Daríen is still perilous, with diseases like malaria and dengue stalking migrants in "a grotesque test of survival," said Carlos Franco-Paredes, a doctor studying the journey.
Beyond that, the foundation's guides take migrants only part of the way, leaving them at the border with Panama, often with no food or money left -- and days of hiking to go in a part of the jungle that is even more dangerous than what they already endured. The United Nations counted more than 140 migrants deaths in the Panama portion of the Darién last year alone, nearly triple the year before. At least 10 percent of them were children.
Mr. Petro, Colombia's first leftist president, came to office last year promising to help long forgotten parts of the country -- like the communities now in charge of the jungle crossings.
In the interview, Mr. Petro said he had never heard of the New Light Darién Foundation. But just like the people running the migration business, he presented his hands-off approach to migration as a humanitarian one.
The answer to this crisis, he said, was not to go "chasing migrants" at the border or to force them into "concentration camps" that blocked them from trying to reach the United States.
"I would say yes, I'll help, but not like you think," Mr. Petro said of the agreement with the Biden administration, which was big on ambition but thin on details. He said any solution to the issue had to focus on "solving migrants' social problems, which do not come from Colombia."
He expects half a million people to cross the Darién this year, he said, and then a million next year.
On the other side of the Darién Gap, Panamanian officials are fuming, accusing "countries to the south" of shirking "their due responsibility" to stem the tide of people heading north.
"There is nothing humanitarian about this," Ms. Gozaine, the Panamanian migration official, said at a recent news conference. "The children who die in the jungle, the women who are raped, the men who are raped, the people who are killed."
Crisis, Then Bonanza
The boats leave each day from the eastern edge of Necoclí, the docks filled with people from around the world -- not only from the Western Hemisphere, but from as far as India, China and Afghanistan.
"Travel safe!" Mr. Marín's employees boom from a microphone. "Travel happy!"
At his office, where a service award from the national police hangs on the wall, Mr. Marín said that he was proud to be a part of the industry that had become the region's most important employer.
Just outside, a new construction project soars, soon to be a gas station that will fuel his boats more quickly than ever.
Remote, tropical and bordering the Caribbean Sea, the Colombian towns on the migrant path to the jungle are beautiful but poor. More than half of their residents live below the poverty line. Many are victims of the country's decades-long war, forced to live among criminal groups for generations. Fishing, tourism and wildcat gold mining have long been among the main sources of income.
But in 2021, the towns started changing, quickly. Thousands of Haitians began showing up, fleeing the tumult that only worsened after the assassination of their president.
Suddenly, the region's already precarious sewage, water and electricity systems were overwhelmed. The beaches filled with migrant tents, pushing out an already struggling tourism industry.
The way local leaders tell it, pleas for help from the national government fell on deaf ears.
Mr. Marín, then a city councilman, was one of the first to do something big, turning crisis into opportunity by taking command of the boat company, Katamaranes S.A.S., with the goal of shuttling migrants to the Darién on their way to the United States.
Since then, Necoclí, once a sleepy beach town offering two-for-one cocktails, nature hikes and sea excursions for tourists, has been transformed.
At almost any hour, day or night, private buses wheeze into town, carrying migrants who have learned about the Darién route on Facebook, WhatsApp and TikTok, the de facto advertising services for the journey.
The streets of Necoclí are now filled with people speaking Mandarin, Persian and Nepali. Locals with wooden carts make a living selling flimsy tents, snake repellent and toddler-size rubber boots. Aid workers in canvas vests patrol the streets, offering a bit of help -- water jugs, diapers, sunscreen.
A laminated instruction booklet tied to the register at a grocery store provides tips for crossing the jungle. A map marks in red the common locations of "violent assaults and rapes."
New hostels are everywhere. In a region so poor that horse carts still plod the streets, expensive motorcycles roar through town and $ 100,000 SUVs roll alongside the sea.
The poorest migrants arrive by foot, camping on the beach. Most come from Venezuela, which has been in the grips of an economic and humanitarian crisis for nearly a decade, with few signs that the country's authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, will give up power any time soon.
Many of the Venezuelan migrants congregate outside a thatch-roof soup kitchen opened just a few months ago by an aid group. Here, children waiting for meals of beans and arepas bear the telltale signs of malnutrition: skinny limbs, hair turned rust yellow.
Francis Sifontes, 32, stood in the breakfast line. In Venezuela, she had made so little working for the government's signature food-distribution program that her husband had been forced to beg in the street.
Destitute, the family moved to Colombia, where they cut sugar cane, grueling work that paid $ 5 a day.
Ms. Sifontes had arrived in Necoclí three weeks before, with her husband, stepson and four young children. To earn money for the rest of the journey, they had found work in the region's new micro-economy, buying small goods in bulk from local merchants -- plastic trash bags, cheap lighters -- and selling them to other migrants for a profit of 20 or 30 cents a piece.
At night they slept in a single tent in the shadow of Mr. Marín's office.
But they were hopeful, Ms. Sifontes said, because they had recently struck a deal with Mr. Marín. If they cleaned the beach by his business, for an unspecified amount of time, she said, Mr. Marín had promised to give them three boat tickets to the Darién.
Darién Gap Inc.
Once across the choppy Gulf of Urabá, the passengers on Mr. Marín's boats arrive in the town of Acandí, at the mouth of the jungle. For decades, some residents here have led migrants into the jungle for a fee, arguing that people would die without help.
But with the arrival of the Haitians in 2021, and then an even bigger wave of Venezuelans in 2022, local leaders began to organize, bringing the migration business under the New Light Darién Foundation.
On a recent afternoon, Alexandra Vilcacundo, 44, traveling with 30 others fleeing the rising violence in Ecuador, stepped onto the wooden dock in Acandí. Ms. Vilcacundo, a seamstress, looked terrified, having left three children behind. "We know that we are risking our lives," she said of the journey ahead.
On the bus to Necoclí, she said they had been stopped five times by Colombian police officers who threatened to arrest them unless they paid bribes. (A dozen others said they had also been extorted by the police.)
Once loaded into motorized rickshaws, Ms. Vilcacundo and the other migrants were ferried through Acandí on dirt roads still flooded from the previous night's rain. They passed cow pastures and a corn field, before finally passing through a gate into a compound Mr. García called "the shelter."
There were no police, migration authorities or international groups present. To the contrary, an insignia -- "AGC," the Spanish initials of the Gaitanist Self-Defense Forces, or Gulf Clan -- had been painted on a wall on the way to the shelter, a reminder of who ultimately called the shots.
Roughly a thousand migrants had gathered inside the compound. Local men in skinny jeans, polo shirts and sunglasses roved the sun-beaten expanse, introducing themselves as the foundation's "advisers," in charge of collecting fees and describing the route from here.
For those who didn't have the money on hand, there was a Western Union agent inside the compound, charging 15 percent per transfer. (The company said it had agents in Acandí, but that anyone operating inside a migrant camp was doing so in an unauthorized way).
Mr. García of the community board showed off public works nearby, built by the board with funds from the migration business, he said: a foot bridge by the dock, a school in one of the area's poorest neighborhoods, meters of paved road, a drainage system so the town would not flood.
He said the town had spent decades trying to become a tourist destination. But for now, without decent schools, a hospital or even a road connecting it to the rest of the country, all it had was migration.
"What we have done" with migration is more than tourism brought "in 50 years," Mr. García said.
Sutures and Ice Cream
Few places embody the transformation of the Darién route like the first camp in the jungle.
Two years ago, the route from the shelter in Acandí to this camp, Las Tecas, was a crude dirt path. Today, it is a road navigable by truck. The camp itself was once a muddy expanse. Today it is a village, with a welcome pavilion, security checkpoint, 38 shops and restaurants, Wi-Fi and even a billiard hall.
Here, the New Light Darién Foundation has organized the vast teams of guides and backpack carriers in their numbered and color-coded T-shirts. A few have dressed up their uniforms further, adding words like "respect" and "friendship" to their sleeves.
The foundation coordinates their schedules to spread around the work -- guides get to make one trek every 15 days -- and pays them $ 125 per trek. Porters are contracted individually by migrants who want help carrying their luggage or children, somewhere between $ 60 and $ 120 per load. Any employees who abandon or rob their charges are fired, said Mr. García.
"If I had not found this job, I have no idea how I would have sustained my family," said Aureliana Domicó, 32, a single mother who works as a backpack carrier, carting up to 70 pounds to the Panama border several times a week. Months ago, a heavy rain wiped out her plantain crop, leaving her four children with nothing to eat. Now, she makes as much as $ 800 a month.
Elmer Arias, 29, a guide, had struggled to find work after losing an arm. He had punched a window in anger, and because there is no hospital in Acandí, it took him days to get care, eventually leading to an amputation. The migrants were not that different from him, he explained -- reaching for better lives, "just like us."
At the Las Tecas welcome pavilion that evening, guides wanded the migrants with metal detectors, a new protocol.
"Razors?" one guide asked, confiscating anything sharp. "Knives? Machetes?"
The next morning, more than 2,000 migrants assembled in the heart of the camp. There were children in Barbie T-shirts, two anxious moms with toddlers on leashes, a man with a baby on his back and a doll tucked into his waistband, a woman with an American flag backpack.
Samuel, 13, wore a purple Lakers shirt. His mother, an elder care aide, had left Venezuela years before, moving from city to city in Colombia and Peru, trying to find decent work. She had spent the last of her savings on their tickets to the jungle.
To their right, the sun rose over the forest. To their left, guides and backpack carriers waited. The crowd buzzed with excitement.
Soon, a man from the foundation, Iván Díaz, climbed a hill above the camp, beginning the morning's orientation. This was not a race, he instructed on a megaphone. This was about surviving to make it to the United States.
Don't sleep by the rivers, he said; they often rise with the rain. Eat food with salt to prevent dehydration. Take breaks. Children should stay with their parents. Pregnant women should stick with the guides. Anyone caught with drugs would get sent back to Necoclí.
A bullhorn roared. "Applause!" Mr. Díaz shouted. The crowd cheered.
"Duro, duro, duro," he yelled -- hard, hard, hard -- "for Maduro, Maduro, Maduro!" he added, a sarcastic nod to the Venezuelan president.
The group laughed and booed.
"With God's blessing it will all go well," Mr. Díaz continued. "I know that in three weeks you will be sending me Western Union transfers from New York."
It was roughly a day and a half hike to the border with Panama, and along the way, the foundation had positioned small camps where migrants could buy water and food.
Prices rose as people climbed. A Gatorade cost $ 2.50 at the start, and $ 5 at the end. Ice cream sellers hiked with the crowd, coolers on their backs. At the bend of a river, the crowds were met by a man holding a platter of homemade empanadas for sale.
The migrants moved slowly, crisscrossing a river, climbing hills knotted by roots. With so many people, the traffic jam at times slowed to gridlock.
By midmorning, Natasha, 5, from Ecuador, slipped from the shoulders of a man who had been carrying her. Natasha came crashing down, slicing a spot above her eye on a rock.
She wailed in pain as blood gushed from her face. Her mother began to panic.
But up ahead, there was a nurse. In recent months, the New Light Darién Foundation has hired several nurses and a doctor to care for the migrants. In the absence of any other institutional presence, they had become a lifeline.
On the porch of a hut, the nurse, José Luis Fernández, cleaned the wound, injected an anesthetic and sutured the cut. "If it had hit a little higher," he said of the blow, "we could have been talking about a dead person."
Mr. Fernández used to work for a public hospital in nearby Turbo, he said, but left "for salary reasons."
The foundation pays him much more.
Most of the group slept that night in a crowded, muddy expanse known to the guides as the Fourth Camp, where a generator buzzed and several restaurants offered fried fish or chicken for $ 10 a plate, a small fortune for most of the migrants.
Many families, having spent all their money to get this far, ate nothing, wondering what they would do for the rest of the trek. At dusk, the camp smelled of human feces and gasoline. The mood began to shift.
In his tent, José García, 32, explained that he had already crossed the Darién last year, but had decided to turn around after it seemed the Biden administration would not let Venezuelans into the United States.
Now, he was trying again, this time with his wife, Dayarid Pernia, 24, and their two children, ages 1 and 3. But by this point, they were penniless.
He rued the prices charged by the foundation to get this far.
"If this were humanitarian," Mr. García said of the route, his voice settling somewhere between a laugh and a cry, "they would lend a hand to those who have nothing."
The Handoff
For thousands of migrants, the normalization of this route has set up a cruel paradox.
On the Colombian side of the Darién, where the government is almost absent and the Gaitanist Self-Defense Forces, or Gulf Clan, dominate, crime in the jungle is lower, at least according to aid groups and researchers interviewing migrants at the end of the route.
That perception of safety is sending more and more people into the forest, believing that they will make it out alive.
But at the border with Panama, the foundation's guides leave them -- crossing could lead to arrest -- and the power of the armed group recedes. Then, on the Panamanian side, small criminal bands rove the forest, using rape as a tool to extract money and punish those who cannot pay.
The regional head of one aid group said that women and children are often the victims, with men forced to watch. Children as young as 6 have been shot and killed in this section of the jungle in the past year.
And anyone without money -- including those who spent it paying guides in Colombia -- is particularly vulnerable.
On their last morning in Colombia, the group of more than 2,000 migrants rose before dawn. Inside one of the restaurants, a few raised their hands in a pre-trek prayer.
"Thank you, Lord," said Nestor Fernández, 33, a Venezuelan who had been working construction in Chile. "Just as we submit to you, may everything that tries to rise against us submit -- every robbery, every theft, every kidnapping, every killing."
In the darkness, the parade of people began their march to the border. Children held jugs of sugar water, which might be their only sustenance for days. A pregnant woman was helped out of the camp by two others, one on each side.
It took roughly two hours to climb two hills known as the Twins, and then they reached a muddy clearing with a hand-painted sign marking the border.
In the clearing, migrants still lucky enough to have money paid their porters. And then a man -- one of the guides had introduced him as the "head of security," without elaboration -- stepped forward to offer final instructions.
Move slowly, stick together and follow a route marked by blue and green pieces of plastic, he told the group. It would take three more days to reach the end of the jungle, he explained, where the United Nations and the government of Panama offered support.
"From the municipality of Acandí," he said before the migrants pushed on, "we would like to wish you a happy trip."

DARIÉN GAP, Panama — Every step through the jungle, there is money to be made.
The boat ride to reach the rainforest: $40. A guide on the treacherous route once you start walking: $170. A porter to carry your backpack over the muddy mountains: $100. A plate of chicken and rice after arduous climbing: $10. Special, all-inclusive packages to make the perilous slog faster and more bearable, with tents, boots and other necessities: $500, or more.
Hundreds of thousands of migrants are now pouring through a sliver of jungle known as the Darién Gap, the only land route to the United States from South America, in a record tide that the Biden administration and the Colombian government have vowed to stop.
But the windfall here at the edge of the continent is simply too big to pass up, and the entrepreneurs behind the migrant gold rush are not underground smugglers hiding from the authorities.
They are politicians, prominent businessmen and elected leaders, now sending thousands of migrants toward the United States in plain sight each day — and charging millions of dollars a month for the privilege.
“We have organized everything: the boatmen, the guides, the bag carriers,” said Darwin García, an elected community board member and former town council member in Acandí, a Colombian municipality at the entrance to the jungle.
The crush of migrants willing to risk everything to make it to the United States is “the best thing that could have happened” to a poor town like his, he said.
Now, García’s younger brother, Luis Fernando Martínez, the head of a local tourism association, is a leading candidate for mayor of Acandí — defending the migration business as the only profitable industry in a place that “didn’t have a defined economy before.”
The Darién Gap has quickly morphed into one of the Western Hemisphere’s most pressing political and humanitarian crises. A trickle only a few years ago has become a flood: More than 360,000 people have already crossed the jungle in 2023, according to the Panamanian government.
In response, the United States, Colombia and Panama signed an agreement in April to “end the illicit movement of people” through the Darién Gap, a practice that “leads to death and exploitation of vulnerable people for significant profit.”
Today, that profit is greater than ever, with local leaders collecting tens of millions of dollars this year alone from migrants in an enormous people-moving operation.
“This is a beautiful economy,” said Fredy Marín, a former town council member in the neighboring municipality of Necoclí who manages a boat company that ferries migrants on their way to the United States, charging them $40 a head. Marín is now running for mayor of Necoclí, vowing to preserve the thriving migration industry.
U.S. diplomats have visited the towns next to the Darién Gap in recent months, strolling dusty streets and shaking hands with Marín, García and others running the migration business. White House officials say they believe that the Colombian government is following through on its commitment to crack down on illicit migration.
But on the ground, the opposite is happening. The New York Times has spent months here in the Darién Gap and surrounding towns, and the national government has, at best, a marginal presence.
Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, acknowledged that the national government had little control over the region, but added that it was not his goal to stop migration through the Darién. After all, he argued, the roots of this migration were “the product of poorly taken measures against Latin American peoples,” particularly by the United States, pointing to Washington’s sanctions against Venezuela.
In the absence of the Colombian government, local leaders have decided to handle migration themselves.
Today, the business is run by elected community board members like García, through a registered nonprofit started by the board’s president and his family. It’s called the New Light Darién Foundation, and it manages the entire route from Acandí to the border with Panama — setting prices for the journey, collecting fees and running sprawling campsites in the jungle.
The foundation has hired more than 2,000 local guides and backpack carriers. Migrants pay for tiers of what the foundation calls “services,” including the basic $170 guide and security package to the border. Then a migration “adviser” wraps two paper bracelets around their wrists as proof of payment.
“Like a ticket to Disney,” said Renny Montilla, 25, a construction worker from Venezuela.
García says that the foundation’s work is legal, in part because it guides people to an international border, but not over one.
Some officials have questioned whether the foundation is running a smuggling operation under the guise of a nonprofit. A human rights officer responsible for monitoring the Necoclí government blamed the crisis on the negligence of national leaders, and noted that officials weren’t motivated to stop it because they were making money from it.
Even García’s brother, the mayoral candidate, said he wished the national government would clarify the legal “thin line” that local residents working in the migration industry were walking.
“Five hundred thousand people are going to pass through” our town, Martínez said. “What do we do?”
Hanging over the entire business is a large and powerful drug-trafficking group called the Gaitanist Self-Defense Forces, sometimes known as the Gulf Clan. Its control over this part of northern Colombia is so complete that the country’s ombudsman’s office calls the group the region’s “hegemonic” armed actor.
In a statement, the armed group contended that it “in no way” profits from “the business that traffics in migrants’ dreams . ”
Petro, the Colombian president, dismissed that notion, saying the Gulf Clan was earning $30 million a year from the migration business.
At the edge of the forest, the transactions are plain to see. Before they enter the jungle, migrants have to pay the group a separate tax of about $80 a person for permission to cross the Darién, according to multiple people who collect the fee in Necoclí.
Once migrants have paid, they even get a receipt, the tax collectors say: a tiny sticker, often an American flag, on their passports.
Taming a Jungle
Thick, hot and prone to intense rain, sliced by raging rivers and steep mountains, the Darién jungle acted as a vast natural barrier between North and South America for generations.
Guerrillas and other armed groups have long used the dense forest for cover and drug smuggling. The terrain and threat of violence once kept all but the most desperate away.
But a stew of crises and politics has brought a huge rise in the number of people trekking from South America to the United States in the past few years.
Now, the New Light Darién Foundation is helping to turn that natural barrier into something much more passable, with restaurants, camps, porters and guides. This new economy, run in large part by elected leaders, has acted as an accelerant, emboldening more people to take — and pay for — the journey than ever.
In August alone, almost 82,000 people made the trek through the Darién, according to Panamanian officials, by far the largest single-month total on record. So many people are coming through the jungle that Panama and Costa Rica say they cannot handle the surge. Panama’s top migration official, Samira Gozaine, has even threatened to close its border with Colombia.
By professionalizing the migration business, Colombian leaders say they can prevent their impoverished towns from being overwhelmed by hundreds of thousands of needy people, help the migrants traverse the treacherous jungle more safely, and feed their own economies in the process.
Migrant deaths in the Colombian portion of the Darién now appear to be relatively low, aid workers say, because even the Gaitanist armed group, or Gulf Clan, has realized that the Darién’s notoriety is bad for business.
The foundation’s guides take migrants only part of the way, leaving them at the border with Panama, often with no food or money left — and days of hiking to go in a part of the jungle that is even more dangerous than what they already endured. The United Nations counted more than 140 migrant deaths in the Panama portion of the Darién last year alone, nearly triple the year before. At least 10% of them were children.
Petro, Colombia’s first leftist president, came to office last year promising to help long forgotten parts of the country — like the communities now in charge of the jungle crossings. In the interview, Petro said he had never heard of the New Light Darién Foundation. But just like the people running the migration business, he presented his hands-off approach to migration as a humanitarian one.
“I would say yes, I’ll help, but not like you think,” Petro said of the agreement with the Biden administration. He said any solution to the issue had to focus on “solving migrants’ social problems, which do not come from Colombia.”
He expects half a million people to cross the Darién this year, he said, and then 1 million next year.
‘Travel Safe!’
The boats leave each day from the eastern edge of Necoclí, the docks filled with people from as far as India, China and Afghanistan.
“Travel safe!” Marín’s employees boom from a microphone. “Travel happy!”
At his office, Marín said that he was proud to be a part of the industry that had become the region’s most important employer.
At almost any hour, day or night, private buses wheeze into town, carrying migrants who have learned about the Darién route on Facebook, WhatsApp and TikTok.
The streets of Necoclí are now filled with people speaking Mandarin, Persian and Nepali. Locals with wooden carts make a living selling flimsy tents, snake repellent and toddler-size rubber boots. Aid workers patrol the streets, offering a bit of help — water jugs, diapers, sunscreen.
The poorest migrants arrive by foot. Most come from Venezuela, which has been in the grips of an economic and humanitarian crisis for nearly a decade.
Once across the choppy Gulf of Urabá, the passengers on Marín’s boats arrive in the town of Acandí, at the mouth of the jungle. For decades, some residents here have led migrants into the jungle for a fee, arguing that people would die without help.
On a recent afternoon, Alexandra Vilcacundo, 44, traveling with 30 others fleeing rising violence in Ecuador, stepped onto the wooden dock in Acandí. Vilcacundo, a seamstress, looked terrified, having left three children behind.
Once loaded into motorized rickshaws, Vilcacundo and the other migrants were ferried through Acandí before finally passing through a gate into a compound García called “the shelter.”
Roughly 1,000 migrants had gathered inside the compound. Local men roved the expanse, introducing themselves as the foundation’s “advisers,” in charge of collecting fees and describing the route from here.
García of the community board showed off public works nearby, built by the board with funds from the migration business.
He said the town had spent decades trying to become a tourist destination. But for now, without decent schools, a hospital or even a road connecting it to the rest of the country, all it had was migration.
“What we have done” with migration is more than tourism brought “in 50 years,” García said.
Gatorade and Ice Cream
Few places embody the transformation of the Darién route like the first camp in the jungle.
Two years ago, the route from the shelter in Acandí to this camp, Las Tecas, was a crude dirt path. Today, it is a road navigable by truck. The camp itself was once a muddy expanse. Today it is a village, with a welcome pavilion, security checkpoint, shops and restaurants, and even a billiard hall.
Here, the New Light Darién Foundation has organized the vast teams of guides and backpack carriers. The foundation coordinates their schedules to spread around the work and pays them $125 per trek. Porters are contracted individually by migrants who want help carrying their luggage or children, somewhere between $60 and $120 per load.
At the Las Tecas welcome pavilion that evening, guides wanded the migrants with metal detectors, a new protocol. The next morning, more than 2,000 migrants assembled in the heart of the camp.
Soon, a man from the foundation, Iván Díaz, climbed a hill above the camp, beginning the morning’s orientation. This was not a race, he instructed on a megaphone. This was about surviving to make it to the United States.
Don’t sleep by the rivers, he said; they often rise with the rain. Eat food with salt to prevent dehydration. Take breaks. Children should stay with their parents.
It was roughly a day and a half hike to the border with Panama, and along the way, the foundation had positioned small camps where migrants could buy water and food.
Prices rose as people climbed. A Gatorade cost $2.50 at the start, and $5 at the end. Ice cream sellers hiked with the crowd, coolers on their backs.
The migrants moved slowly, crisscrossing a river, climbing hills knotted by roots. With so many people, the traffic jam at times slowed to gridlock.
Most of the group slept that night in a crowded, muddy expanse where a generator buzzed and several restaurants offered fried fish or chicken for $10 a plate.
Many families, having spent all their money to get this far, ate nothing, wondering what they would do for the rest of the trek. At dusk, the camp smelled of human feces and gasoline. The mood began to shift.
The Handoff
For thousands of migrants, the normalization of this route has set up a cruel paradox.
On the Colombian side of the Darién, where the government is almost absent and the Gaitanist Self-Defense Forces, or Gulf Clan, dominate, crime in the jungle is lower, at least according to aid groups and researchers interviewing migrants at the end of the route.
That perception of safety is sending more and more people into the forest, believing that they will make it out alive.
But at the border with Panama, the foundation’s guides leave them — crossing could lead to arrest — and the power of the armed group recedes. Then, on the Panamanian side, small criminal bands rove the forest, using rape as a tool to extract money and punish those who cannot pay.
On their last morning in Colombia, the group of more than 2,000 migrants rose before dawn.
It took roughly two hours to climb two hills known as the Twins, and then they reached a muddy clearing with a hand-painted sign marking the border.
In the clearing, migrants still lucky enough to have money paid their porters. And then a man stepped forward to offer final instructions.
Move slowly, stick together and follow a route marked by blue and green pieces of plastic, he told the group. It would take three more days to reach the end of the jungle, he explained, where the United Nations and the government of Panama offered support.
“From the municipality of Acandí,” he said before the migrants pushed on, “we would like to wish you a happy trip.”

Locked-Room Mystery, With a Horror Twist: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Kenneth Branagh directs and stars in this adaptation of a ghostly mystery from Agatha Christie, with assists from Michelle Yeoh and Tina Fey.
What genre does "A Haunting in Venice" belong to?
Twirl a mustache and join me on the case. Our first clue is that Kenneth Branagh is playing Hercule Poirot in his third adaptation of an Agatha Christie story. So, this would appear to be an open-and-shut case. Add a murder in a spooky house peopled by suspects, and you have all the hallmarks of a classic locked-room mystery. But Christie fans will quickly deduce that the screenwriter Michael Green has departed considerably from "Hallowe'en Party," the original source material from 1969, one of her later, lesser books, adding elements that move into the realm of supernatural horror. Be on guard for misdirection.
A glum Poirot, retired from solving cases, has been invited to attend a séance where a famous opera singer, Rowena Drake (Kelly Reilly), wants to contact her dead daughter. The medium (or fraud?) is played with brio by Michelle Yeoh, and her psychic powers present a challenge to the stony rationality of the aging detective. Unlike his relatively faithful, innocuously entertaining versions of "Murder on the Orient Express" and "Death on the Nile," Branagh is pushing into ghostly new territory, leaning on scary-movie tropes such as scurrying rats, jump scares and that old standby, a face popping up in the mirror.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
It's a bit gloomy as a mystery, but perfunctory as horror. Too talky, for one thing. Branagh, who dabbled in gothic terror early in his career when he made "Frankenstein," has more of a feel for actorly grand guignol than the pace of cinematic-scare sequences. Just when you are about to return to the whodunit, there's an invigorating twist, spurred largely by the presence of Tina Fey, who, between this movie and her wryly satirical flourishes as an opportunistic podcaster in the series "Only Murders in the Building," is getting awfully skilled at playing a potential killer. Fey here embodies the sharp-tongued Ariadne Oliver, a mystery author with a screwball cadence, touchy about her critical reception.
Fey introduces a comedic energy into the movie, talking out of the side of her mouth while accompanying Poirot. She adds some much-needed fizzy carbonation to the stiff drink of mystery solving. Branagh wants to tell a story of a shaken, brooding Poirot struggling with decline, but luckily, camp humor intrudes. When he aims his preposterous French accent at the French actress Camille Cotton, who plays a housekeeper, it makes you think a good time was had on set.
In straddling genres, "Haunting" can get stuck in the middle. But there's fun to be had there. What's consistent is the elegant visuals -- striking cinematography by Haris Zambarloukos -- which mark this movie's real genre as lavish old-fashioned Hollywood entertainment. Canted views of surprising corners of the house alternate with postcard-stunning shots of rainy Venetian nights. But the dominant images are close-ups of movie stars, including long, lingering glances at Branagh, whose whispery gravitas provides good, if melancholy, company and occasional wit.
In the original book, Poirot ponders the subject of beauty. He sounds skeptical and a bit insecure. "There was only one thing about his own appearance which really pleased Hercule Poirot," Christie writes, "and that was the profusion of his mustache."
Branagh remained entirely faithful on this trait. But he couldn't help but add a soul patch.

'Water for Elephants' to Broadway: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The show, with a group of circus artists as part of the cast, is adapted from Sara Gruen's best-selling novel.
"Water for Elephants," Sara Gruen's novel about a Depression-era veterinary student whose life is transformed when he joins a circus, became a surprise best seller after it was published in 2006. Five years later came a film adaptation, and next spring, a spectacle-rich stage musical version will open on Broadway.
The musical, as befits a show set primarily at a circus, will feature seven circus performers, who make up about one-third of the onstage cast. As in the novel, the story is told through the recollections of the main character in his older years.
"Most people think of the story as about this young man who jumps on a train and joins the circus, but I'm really compelled by his older self, looking back on the chapter that changed the course of his life forever," said the musical's director, Jessica Stone, who also directed "Kimberly Akimbo," the winner of this year's Tony for best musical. "The show is about the kind of person you are when you lose everything, and it's also about chosen family, and the choices you make with the time that you have."
"Water for Elephants," a big-budget musical that has been in development for about eight years, had an initial run in June and July at the Alliance Theater in Atlanta. After some reworking aimed at strengthening the storytelling, it is scheduled to begin previews on Feb. 24 and to open March 21 at the Imperial Theater.
The musical is set largely in 1931; its book is by Rick Elice ("Jersey Boys," "Peter and the Starcatcher") and the score is by PigPen Theater Co. The circus design is by Shana Carroll, who is an artistic director of The 7 Fingers, a prestigious Montreal-based circus collective; Carroll is also collaborating on the choreography with Jesse Robb.
The show is being capitalized for up to $ 25 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which could make it the biggest-budget production of the current Broadway season.
The producing team is being led by Peter Schneider, a former Disney animation executive who played a key role in bringing "The Lion King" to Broadway, and Jennifer Costello, a former executive at the John Gore Organization, where Schneider is the chairman of the board. The other lead producers are Grove Entertainment, Frank Marshall, Isaac Robert Hurwitz and Seth A. Goldstein.

TV Viewers Feel the Pain Of the Ax: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Despite high-profile cuts, streaming isn't as brutal on new shows as network TV was. (But it's not the paradise we hoped for, either.)
It is time that we have a discussion about cancel culture.
No, not that kind.
Streaming TV, which once seemed to be infinitely expanding, is experiencing shrinkage. Even before the writers' and actors' strikes threatened the pipeline of new series, Max saw a round of cost-cutting cancellations including the "Gossip Girl" reboot, "Minx" (later saved by Starz) and a completed "Batgirl" movie. Amazon Prime Video has thrown the likes of "A League of Their Own" and "The Peripheral" overboard. Disney+ recently precanceled its already-made children's fantasy adaptation, "The Spiderwick Chronicles." Hulu's acclaimed Russian-monarchy comedy "The Great" has been deposed. A string of high-profile Netflix cancellations has become the stuff of protests and memes.
With all this has come a new belief: That TV series are now being canceled at an unprecedented rate, and you can't count on any show sticking around anymore. Netflix, said a recent piece in Cinemablend, "seems to cancel its original shows with unjustified speed and harshness," with many series lasting only "one or two seasons."
I have had my heart broken enough over the years by enough cancellations to sympathize with disappointed fans. But to paraphrase a series that did get a full run: Oh, my sweet summer children, what do you know about premature cancellation?
The streaming era, in truth, has nothing on the blood baths of the regular-old-TV era. There was a period in my lifetime -- and unless you are a precocious grade-schooler, your lifetime too -- when it was not only not unusual for series to get the ax after Season 1, it was the norm.
Let's take 2011-12, the last broadcast TV season to begin before Netflix entered the original-series business with "Lilyhammer" in 2012. At the time, only around one-third of new broadcast series made it past their first seasons. Of the rest, many were yanked mid-run, with no warning, before even airing all the episodes they'd shot.
A few series that season would go on for healthy runs: "New Girl," "Scandal," "Last Man Standing." But a scan of the premiere list is a sea of red ink and broken dreams. "Terra Nova," the expensive dinosaur flop on Fox, was extinct by December. ABC's "Work It," about men who dressed as women to land jobs in a bad economy, was fired after two episodes. "Pan Am," "How to Be a Gentleman," "I Hate My Teenage Daughter," dead, dead, dead.
This was not, in retrospect, a great season of network TV (we can thank or blame it for "Smash," which actually got a second season). But it was not an unusual one either. Networks' standard procedure was to hurl pilots toward success like sperm toward an egg. Most would not make it. (Some special shows, like Fox's racy 1999 high-school drama "Manchester Prep," the first TV series set I ever visited as a critic, were canceled before airing a single episode.)
Cancellation, in those days, was not a disappointed assessment made after seeing the performance of a full season. It was summary execution in the street. One Thursday, you were strutting your stuff opposite "The Office"; the next, nothing was left but a grease spot and a "Big Bang Theory" rerun.
And even if you survived a first season, your eventual end would usually not offer closure. It was just lights out, and not the artsy "Sopranos" kind. Having a show "end on its own terms" was not an expectation; it was a freaking event. "Cheers," "Seinfeld," "Lost" -- for these series to air planned finales that wrapped up their stories (or tried to) was unusual enough to merit wall-to-wall media coverage.
Nor was a small, intense niche of fans enough to save a show. To love daring, out-of-the-box TV back then was to have loved and lost, to see an innovative show premiere and think, "Yeah, that's totally getting canceled." And usually you would be right. "Freaks and Geeks." "My So-Called Life." "Firefly." I have scars, my friend.
Of course, in the broadcast era you got these shows for free -- or for "free" if you didn't count buying your TV set and the time invested in watching unskippable commercials. But that meant that you got the level of certainty that you paid for -- and what the advertising revenues didn't pay for, you didn't get.
Like cable before it, streaming promised to change the game. Netflix and its competition tended to wait longer to pull the plug in the early days. As with everything in TV, there were business reasons for this. They operated more like tech companies, willing to bleed money to establish first-mover advantage. And because they were building libraries of original programming (to be less dependent on acquisitions), they were motivated to be patient.
Now these platforms have gotten bigger, and there are more of them. Wall Street has become insistent on growth and returns. And that means that the new era of TV has turned to an old TV-business strategy: Cut, cut, cut.
But not only have Netflix, Max and the rest not invented the practice of killing shows, they are still relative amateurs at it. A 2023 study by The Wrap found that Netflix formally canceled a mere 11 percent of its new shows, far below the broadcast rate. (The analysis did note that Netflix airs many single-season "limited series" that might have been, er, less limited had more people watched them.)
Now that we have the old-man-yelling-at-cloud part of this out of the way: Some things are genuinely different today. One is that streaming platforms, and to some extent cable, simply make fewer episodes of everything, including their biggest hits.
Success today is more like a solid four, five, six seasons -- even fewer sometimes, and sometimes by the creators' choice, as with "Reservation Dogs," which I wanted to run forever and which is closing up shop after three seasons. And those seasons tend to run eight or 10 episodes, not the 22 (or more, in TV's early years) of a full network order.
Past TV classics built up affection and status through repetition. "M*A*S*H" aired 256 episodes, "Frasier" 264. We spent more time with them, allocated more neurons to their memory, than with even smash hits on Netflix like "Stranger Things" (34 episodes to date). There are still a few of those long-running TV mega-fauna in existence, like "The Simpsons," "South Park" and "Law and Order: SVU," but they are increasingly holdovers of a bygone climate.
But maybe the biggest difference today lies in viewers' expectations. The implicit promise of streaming platforms was to empower viewers. You'd watch what you wanted when you wanted, and you would get the shows broadcast TV wouldn't make, with the closure it rarely provided.
Today's "Netflix/Max/Amazon cancels everything!" outrage may be the product of a relatively short historical period of subsidized patience. But you can't entirely blame subscribers for expecting things to stay that way.
Meanwhile, where streaming once promised an endless video vault, lately canceled series like "Westworld" and "Willow" have been pulled from the services' libraries altogether. Not being able to watch a canceled show is also nothing new, of course; once the ax fell in the prestreaming era, the reruns were accessible only on VHS or DVD or, more likely, in your memory.
That, again, was assumed to be the deal. Easy come, easy go. Now that TV has won similar status to art forms like film and literature, you'd think it would have a similar permanence, or should.
Yes, it costs real money -- in residual and licensing payments, for instance -- to keep an old series available on streaming. Viewers may not be aware of the cost. But they are aware that they're paying $ 10 a month and up (and up and up ...) per service. It's only reasonable for them to ask what they're getting.
Streaming platforms like to tout themselves as disrupters and innovators. Cancellations, instead, are one more means by which they are recreating TV's oldest practices -- albeit with a twist. TV has always found ways to break our hearts. The difference now is that it's found new ways to make us pay for the privilege.

She's Seen The World, And Now She's Livid: [Review]

Full text: On her second album, "Guts," which flaunts rock brashness and singer-songwriter intimacy, the sudden pop star is showing just how fraught life is at the top.
One of the fundamental conditions -- or is it goals? -- of pop stardom is hiding the work. You may see Beyoncé sweat, or note how Taylor Swift's real-life travails inform her artistic choices, but the music created by the most famous performers in pop rarely refers back to the costs, literal and emotional, of making it.
But what if you want to show the work?
That's the novel approach of Olivia Rodrigo, a modern and somewhat signature pop star. At the beginning of 2021, she released "Drivers License," her first single outside the Disney ecosystem she was creatively raised in, and experienced the kind of supernova ascent that's impossible to anticipate or recreate. Her jolting debut album, "Sour," released a few months later, showed her to be a spiky, vivid writer and singer, but one who hadn't quite seen the world.
Two years later, on her poignantly fraught, spiritually and sonically agitated follow-up album "Guts," Rodrigo has seen too much. "Guts" is an almost real-time reckoning with the maelstrom of new celebrity, the choices it forces upon you and the compromises you make along the way. As on "Sour," Rodrigo, who is 20 now, toggles between bratty rock gestures and piano-driven melancholy. But regardless of musical mode, her emotional position is consistent throughout these dozen songs about betrayal, regret and self-flagellation.
"I used to think I was smart/But you made me look so naïve," she howls on the lead single "Vampire" -- she's referring to a toxic ex, but she may as well be singing about the spotlight itself. Or as she puts it on "Making the Bed," "I got the things I wanted/It's just not what I imagined."
Rodrigo is a songwriter of rather astonishing purity -- even in her most stylized lyrics, she never wanders far from the unformed gut-kick of a feeling. Sometimes on this album, she triples down. "I loved you truly/Gotta laugh at the stupidity," she chuckles on "Vampire." "I look so stupid thinking/Two plus two equals five/and I'm the love of your life," she croons on "Logical." "My God, how could I be so stupid," she sighs on "Love Is Embarrassing."
Don't mistake Rodrigo's weakness for weakness, though. Her self-doubt is a powerful animating force. Throughout this album, she kiln-fires her anxieties into lyrics that cut deep. "Pretty Isn't Pretty" is about the existential struggle of self-love, particularly under an unrelenting public eye. The impudent "Ballad of a Homeschooled Girl" captures the essence of outsider awkwardness.
The dreamy -- and perhaps "Folklore"-esque -- "Lacy" is about being robbed of your illusions: "I despise my rotten mind/and how much it worships you," Rodrigo sings. From a young star who's had what appears to be frosty relations with Swift, an idol who was retroactively granted songwriting credit on Rodrigo's first album, it reads like the bruise from a door slammed shut in her face.
Several other songs are about being on the wrong side of a manipulative relationship. "Logical" and "The Grudge" tackle it via self-serious angst. But Rodrigo has more spark when she's playfully ambivalent about how, or if, to break free. "Bad Idea Right?," driven by throbbing bass and drizzled with layered, saccharine chanting, is about how holding on can be more fun than letting go. And "Get Him Back!" is a revenge fantasy -- "I wanna meet his mom/Just to tell her her son sucks" -- that's maybe, just maybe, leaning in to double entendre.
The real casualties documented in these songs are the relationships Rodrigo has, or had, with her actual friends. On "Get Him Back!" she imagines their disappointment as she sends a note to that risible ex. On "Love Is Embarrassing" she recounts telling them breathlessly about her new obsession, only to have him let her down immediately thereafter. It's not that her old life is sitting in judgment of her new one, but rather that she's lost touch with the anchors that grounded her, and she's floating into a grotesque unknown. "Getting drunk at a club with my fair-weather friends," she laments on "Making the Bed."
All of those songs are, in one way or another, about the perils of being wide-eyed. But Rodrigo is also beginning to harden her shell. On "All-American Bitch," which opens the album, she details the impossible standard for young women in the public eye: "I'm grateful all the time/I'm sexy and I'm kind/I'm pretty when I cry."
And she sings with breezy confidence about physical intimacy in a way more akin to hyperstylized dance floor-focused pop stars who use sexuality as performance. On "Logical," she replays how an ex belittled her: "Said I was too young, I was too soft/Can't take a joke, can't get you off." The moody "Making the Bed," uses the titular phrase as a recurring motif of restoration, or perhaps of papering over misspent nights with fresh sheets.
Rodrigo writes her own lyrics, and "Guts" is produced by Daniel Nigro, who was also her creative partner on "Sour." That small circle frees her from the committee-tested gleam of most mainstream pop. Her sudden success means she has not (yet?) needed to subject herself to the homogenization of the Max Martins of the world -- she has succeeded by rendering her intimacies on a grand stage. That's part of why "Guts" leans heavily into rock -- pop-punk ("All-American Bitch," "Ballad of a Homeschooled Girl"), a little new wave ("Love Is Embarrassing"), theatrical folk ("Lacy") -- which gives her songs thickness and a little bit of rowdiness, too. But some of this album's most punk moments, as it were, come when Rodrigo unleashes holy hell while Nigro simply plays the piano.
On her debut album, Rodrigo made semi-subtle nods to earlier female pop stars -- there can still sometimes be the sense that she is constructing her songs of pre-existing parts, whether from Swift or Alanis Morissette or Avril Lavigne or Veruca Salt. The winks come in the song titles -- "Love Is Embarrassing" nods to Sky Ferreira, a parallel-universe meta-pop star of a decade ago who also trafficked in seen-it-all realness. And then there's the album closer, "Teenage Dream," which invokes Katy Perry, the archetypically glossy 21st century pop princess.
Perry's "Teenage Dream" is a naïve cupcake, an exhortation to live, laugh, love. Rodrigo's is a morbid piano plaint about the falsity beneath all that. The dream is a mirage, and Rodrigo is pulling back the curtain on it: "I fear that they already got all the best parts of me/And I'm sorry that I couldn't always be your teenage dream."
Here, and in the most potent moments on "Guts," Rodrigo's music pulses with the verve of someone who's been buttoned tight beginning to come loose. Unraveling is messy business, but it is also freedom.

Full text: The company's approach has paid off to a degree that even the C.E.O. could hardly have believed possible.
When Ynon Kreiz arrived at Mattel in April 2018, the newly installed chief executive had one mantra when it came to a feature film starring Barbie, a project he really wanted to get off the ground: He didn't care if the movie sold a single additional doll.
But "Barbie" the film had to be good and a cultural event. It had to be different. It had to break molds.
And if that meant turning the chief executive of Mattel -- i.e., himself -- into the object of comic ridicule in the portrayal of the chief executive character in the film ("vain and foolish to the nth degree," as The Guardian put it), then so be it.
That approach has paid off to a degree that even Mr. Kreiz could hardly have believed possible. "Barbie" is close to grossing $ 1.4 billion and passed one of the "Harry Potter" movies as the top-grossing Warner Bros. film of all time. It could end up near the $ 2 billion mark. (The record-holder is 2009's "Avatar," at $ 2.9 billion.)
How Mattel pulled off a feat that had eluded the company for years was the subject of recent interviews with Mr. Kreiz; Robbie Brenner, Mattel's executive producer of films; spokespeople for Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig, the film's star and its writer-director; and others familiar with the doll's sometimes tortuous path to the big screen.
Mattel and Warner have jealously guarded their financial arrangements. But people with knowledge of their agreement said Mattel earned 5 percent of the box office revenue, as well as a percentage of eventual profits as a producer of the movie and additional payments as owner of the Barbie intellectual property rights. At $ 2 billion in box office revenue, that amounts to $ 100 million. In addition, there are sales of merchandise connected to the movie as well as an expected boost in sales of dolls.
Representatives for Mattel and Warner declined to comment on the financial arrangements, though the company's chief financial officer said at a conference on Thursday that the company would make about $ 125 million in total billings from the film.
Even though Barbie results weren't reflected in Mattel's latest earnings, released July 26, all anyone wanted to talk about at the earnings call was "Barbie." Mr. Kreiz hailed the film as a "milestone moment" in the company's strategy to "capture the value of its I.P." and demonstrate its ability to attract and team up with top creative talent -- a cornerstone of its ambitious slate of more toy-themed movies.
After the first "Barbie" trailer -- showing a hyper-blond, Day-Glo-clad Ms. Robbie and Ryan Gosling skating along Venice Beach -- went viral in December, anticipation started building. Mattel stock has been on a tear. It has gained 33 percent, from $ 16.24 on Dec. 19 to this week's $ 21.55. The S&P 500 rose 16 percent over the same period.
Wall Street has been reluctant to give much credit to one hit, on the theory that such success is hard to replicate. ("Barbie" has had no discernible impact on Warner Bros. Discovery's stock price.)
But for Mattel, the positive impact of "Barbie" goes far beyond just one film. The company's yearslong strategy to become a major film producer, using its vast storehouse of toys as intellectual property, had been met in Hollywood with skepticism, if not outright mockery. A-list talent wasn't lining up to direct a plush purple dinosaur like Barney. But now the perception that Mattel's leadership is willing to trust and support an unorthodox creative team that delivered both a box office bonanza and a possible awards contender has radically altered that.
And Mattel's surprising willingness to make fun of itself was one of the elements that mostly delighted critics and added to the buzz that roped in many more moviegoers than the "Barbie" fan base.
That Mr. Kreiz was willing to laugh at his own caricature came as something as a surprise to some acquaintances and former colleagues. An Israeli military veteran with dual Israeli and British citizenship, a former professional wind surfer, an avid kite surfer and a fitness buff, with more than a passing resemblance to a younger Arnold Schwarzenegger, the 58-year-old Mr. Kreiz comes across as more of a square-jawed G.I. Joe action hero than a Barbie fan with a sense of humor.
Mr. Kreiz's entire career was in media and entertainment, not retail. His longtime mentor, the Power Rangers entrepreneur and billionaire Haim Saban, hired him fresh out of the University of California, Los Angeles, to launch Fox Kids Europe, a joint venture with Fox. He later ran Maker Studios, a YouTube aggregator, which Disney acquired in 2014. Mr. Kreiz left in 2016, and Maker was folded into the Disney Digital Network in 2017.
That "Barbie" even got made was no small feat. It had languished at Sony for years, with Mattel routinely renewing the option, as various writers struggled to adapt the doll for the big screen. Although one of the most popular toys ever, Barbie was the subject of intense controversy, seen both as a symbol of female empowerment and as an impossible standard of beauty and femininity. The only feasible approach seemed a parody. The comedian Amy Schumer was once slated for the part. But scripts came and went.
Weeks after becoming chief executive in 2018, Mr. Kreiz refused to renew the Sony option, according to multiple people interviewed for this article. He called Ms. Robbie's agent and asked for a meeting. Ms. Robbie was among the most sought-after young actresses in Hollywood, fresh from acclaimed performances in diverse roles -- as the ill-fated ice skater Tonya Harding in "I, Tonya"; in Martin Scorsese's "The Wolf of Wall Street"; and as a fixture in Warner's DC Comics universe as Harley Quinn, the Joker's former girlfriend. And while no human could replicate Barbie's exaggerated dimensions, Ms. Robbie came reasonably close, while also radiating wholesome beauty.
Ms. Robbie was simultaneously reaching out to Mattel and Mr. Kreiz after learning that the "Barbie" option hadn't been renewed. She was looking for a potential franchise to take to Warner, where her production company, LuckyChap, had a first-look deal. But she wasn't looking to star in the film herself.
Over breakfast at the Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills Hotel, the plush entertainment and celebrity hangout not far from Mattel's less glamorous El Segundo headquarters, Mr. Kreiz shared his vision: He didn't want to make movies in order just to sell toys. He wanted something fresh, unconventional, bold.
"Our vision for Barbie was someone with a strong voice, a clear message, with cultural resonance that would make a societal impact," he said, recalling his message.
Mr. Kreiz's obvious enthusiasm and determination, and his pitch for creative integrity make him hard to resist, as Ms. Brenner, a producer, discovered when he recruited her to run the newly created Mattel film division during another meal at the Polo Lounge. Ms. Brenner, a respected producer and an Academy Award nominee for "Dallas Buyers Club," was attracted to his idea for the movie. In Mr. Kreiz's vision, Mattel would be as much a movie company as a toy company. The two bonded after he asked her who should play Barbie, and she, too, volunteered Ms. Robbie.
At their first meeting, Ms. Robbie suggested Ms. Gerwig for the director. The two were friends and had talked about working together. Mr. Kreiz loved the idea in part because it was so unexpected -- Ms. Gerwig had directed and written acclaimed but offbeat independent films like "Frances Ha," "Lady Bird" and a new take on the classic "Little Women," but no big-budget fare.
"Lady Bird" was one of Ms. Brenner's favorite movies. But would Ms. Gerwig consider such a mass-market, commercial proposal?
Ms. Gerwig, it turned out, had played with Barbie dolls and loved them. She even had old photos of herself playing with Barbie. Ms. Brenner met with Ms. Gerwig and her partner, Noah Baumbach, also an acclaimed screenwriter and director, at an editing facility in New York. They kicked around a few ideas, but nothing concrete emerged. Anything seemed possible.
A deal was struck, and Warner signed on as co-producer. Once Ms. Gerwig was on board, Ms. Robbie agreed to star.
At which point Ms. Gerwig and Mr. Baumbach retreated. "I know it's not conventional and not what you're used to, but we have to go into a room for a few months. That's how we work and want to do it," as Ms. Gerwig put it, Mr. Kreiz recalled.
When the script did land in Ms. Brenner's email, it was 147 pages -- the length of a Quentin Tarantino film, epic by Hollywood standards. She closed her office door and started reading. "It was like going on this crazy ride," she recalled. It broke rules, including the so-called fourth wall, addressing the audience directly. It poked fun at Mattel.
New to the company, Ms. Brenner didn't know if this would prove too much for Mattel executives. But she believed it was a great script.
Ms. Brenner's first call was to Mr. Kreiz. "I've read a lot of scripts, and this is so different," she told him. "It's special. You don't get this feeling many times in an entire career."
Mr. Kreiz read the script twice, back to back. "It was deep, provoking, unconventional and imaginative," he said. "It was everything I was hoping it would be."
Ms. Brenner was pleasantly surprised. "Ynon is a very confident person," she said. "He can laugh at himself."
At one point Mr. Kreiz flew to London, where "Barbie" sets were being built at Warner's studio outside the city. He and Ms. Gerwig spent a half-hour discussing the perfect shade of pink.
Mr. Kreiz and Ms. Brenner knew they had a potential hit. "It was our secret that we couldn't talk about," Ms. Brenner recalled.
The original budget target of $ 80 million jumped above $ 120 million once Ms. Gerwig was signed. But even that wouldn't realize the director's full vision for the film. For Warner executives it was a struggle to find what are known as "comps," similar films that had grossed enough to justify such an outlay.
Would "Barbie" be another "Charlie's Angels" from 2019 -- which was budgeted at $ 55 million but grossed only $ 73 million and, after marketing costs, lost money? Or another "Wonder Woman" from 2017, budgeted at over $ 100 million, with a worldwide gross of $ 822 million?
Eventually the budget hit $ 141 million and, with some reshoots, ultimately topped $ 150 million.
On opening night, July 21, Mr. Kreiz took his 19-year-old daughter to the Regal cinema complex at Union Square in Manhattan. As they neared the theater, droves of moviegoers -- and not just young girls -- were heading to it in pink outfits. Five screenings were in progress. All were sold out.
Mr. Kreiz and his daughter dropped in and out to gauge audience reactions. People laughed, applauded and in a few cases shed tears.
Of course the success of "Barbie" has drastically raised the bar -- and expectations -- for Mattel's movies in development, starting with "Masters of the Universe," written and directed by the brothers Adam and Aaron Nee. Twelve more films are in various stages of development, including a "Hot Wheels" produced by J.J. Abrams, also at Warner. Some of these may need to be rethought.
And there will no doubt be "Barbie" sequels, perhaps even a James Bond-like franchise, which would be Mr. Kreiz's ultimate fantasy (although he said it was too soon to discuss any such plans).
Mr. Kreiz acknowledged that in a notoriously fickle and unpredictable business, future success is hardly assured. But "Barbie" has given Mattel momentum -- the beginning of what he calls "a multiyear franchise management strategy."

Gary Wright, 80, Dies; 'Dream Weaver' Singer Who Synthesized Pop: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He was a pioneer in using synthesizers, and his friendship with George Harrison led to a spiritual awakening that also influenced another hit, "Love Is Alive."
Gary Wright, the spiritually minded singer-songwriter who helped modernize the sound of pop music with his pioneering use of synthesizers while crafting infectious and seemingly inescapable hits of the 1970s, notably "Dream Weaver" and "Love Is Alive," died on Monday at his home in Palos Verdes Estates, Calif. He was 80.
The cause was complications of Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia, his son Justin said.
The New Jersey-bred Mr. Wright rose to prominence in the late 1960s after relocating to London and helping to form the bluesy British progressive rock band Spooky Tooth.
He soon befriended George Harrison, with whom he would collaborate frequently over the years, including playing keyboards on his post-Beatles magnum opus, the triple album "All Things Must Pass," released in 1970.
Their long friendship would have a lasting impact on both Mr. Wright's life and his music. Mr. Harrison introduced him to Eastern mysticism, giving him a copy of "Autobiography of a Yogi," by Paramahansa Yogananda, who helped popularize yoga and meditation in the United States, and Mr. Harrison traveled with him to India.
"That was his life path after that," Justin Wright said in a phone interview. "Deep down inside of him, he was searching for something, and this was the answer for him."
His spiritual awakening helped spawn "Dream Weaver," a track from his 1975 album, "The Dream Weaver," which hit No. 7 on the Billboard album chart and rocketed Mr. Wright to fame. The song was inspired by the yogi's poem "God, God, God," which includes the line "My mind weaves dreams."
Mr. Wright begins the song with the lyrics "I've just closed my eyes again/Climbed aboard the dream weaver train/Driver take away my worries of today/And leave tomorrow behind."
"Dream Weaver," swept along by a wave of lush electronica that bordered on the interstellar, soared to No. 2 on the Billboard single chart in March 1976. The song became a soft-rock touchstone, appearing in such movies as "Wayne's World" (1992) and "The People vs. Larry Flynt" (1996), as well as on a 2010 episode (titled "Dream On") of the musical comedy-drama TV series "Glee."

It was not the only smash hit from that album. That July, "Love Is Alive," like "Dream Weaver," rose to No. 2, conjuring the languid sexuality of the water bed era. Mr. Wright performed at stadium shows on the same bill as heavyweights like Peter Frampton and Yes, standing out among the guitar gods with his strap-on keyboard known as a keytar.
While his biggest hits became emblematic sounds of the 1970s, Mr. Wright had taken an unconventional musical approach on the album "The Dream Weaver." He relied almost entirely on keyboard instruments, including a Minimoog synthesizer, as opposed to guitars, foreshadowing the synth-pop boom of the early '80s.
"The theme of having only keyboards, drums, voices -- and no guitars -- came accidentally," Mr. Wright said in a 2010 interview with Musoscribe, a music website. When he went back and listened to the demos he had recorded, he said, "I thought, 'Wow. This sounds good. It doesn't really need guitars."'
Gary Malcolm Wright was born on April 26, 1943, in Cresskill, in northeast New Jersey. He was the middle of three children of Lou and Anne (Belvedere) Wright. His father was a structural engineer.
His mother helped instill in Gary an interest in music and acting, driving him to piano lessons and eventually to auditions. Their efforts paid off when he made an appearance on the seminal science fiction TV series "Captain Video and His Video Rangers" and later won a role in the 1954 Broadway musical "Fanny," starring Florence Henderson.
"I originally came into the play as an understudy to the main role, and then I picked up the main child role," Mr. Wright said in a 2014 interview with Smashing Interviews magazine. "I was only 11 and 12 during those years. It was an amazing experience to act and sing every night before sold-out audiences and sing with a full orchestral band."
Within a few years, he abandoned the stage and screen "to be a normal kind of person in school, playing sports and Little League baseball and that kind of thing," he told Smashing Interviews. While attending Tenafly High School, he played in various rock groups, including a duo called Gary and Billy with his school friend Bill Markle. Their single "Working After School" was played on the Dick Clark television show "American Bandstand."
After high school, Mr. Wright attended William & Mary in Virginia for a year before transferring to New York University, where he switched his focus to medicine. After graduating in 1965, he briefly enrolled in medical school before moving to Berlin to study psychology.
Losing interest in a life in clinical practice, he went back to music, helping to form a band that built a following in Europe; at one point it opened for the rock group Traffic in Oslo. There he caught the attention of Chris Blackwell, the founder of Island Records. Mr. Blackwell summoned him to England to join a band called Art, which evolved into Spooky Tooth.
Spooky Tooth temporarily disbanded in 1970, and soon after that Mr. Wright released two solo albums. One of them, "Footprint," featured Mr. Harrison on guitar on the track "Two Faced Man," which the two performed with Mr. Wright's band Wonderwheel on "The Dick Cavett Show" in 1971.
In addition to his son Justin, Mr. Wright is survived by his wife, Rose (Anthony) Wright; another son, Dorian; a sister, Lorna Lee; and two grandchildren. His marriages to Christina Uppstrom, the mother of his sons, and Dori Accordino ended in divorce.
Along with his work with Mr. Harrison, Mr. Wright was a session keyboardist for musicians like Harry Nilsson, B.B. King and Jerry Lee Lewis, and he continued to record solo albums.
In the Musoscribe interview, he discussed his 2010 release, "Connected," and the album's hook-laden opening track, "Satisfied," in terms that could have applied to "Dream Weaver."
"The word 'hook' means drawing people into something," he said. "When I write songs, I always try to make them that way -- catchy -- so that people will remember them. They'll be more embedded in people's consciousness."

Mattel’s Windfall From ‘Barbie’

When Ynon Kreiz arrived at Mattel in April 2018, the newly installed CEO had one mantra when it came to a feature film starring Barbie, a project he really wanted to get off the ground: He didn’t care if the movie sold a single additional doll.
But “Barbie” the film had to be good and a cultural event. It had to be different. It had to break molds.

It could end up near the $2 billion mark. (The record-holder is 2009’s “Avatar,” at $2.9 billion.)
How Mattel pulled off a feat that had eluded the company for years was the subject of recent interviews with Kreiz; Robbie Brenner, Mattel’s executive producer of films; spokespeople for Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig, the film’s star and its writer-director; and others familiar with the doll’s sometimes tortuous path to the big screen.

Mattel stock has been on a tear. It has gained 33%, from $16.24 on Dec. 19 to this week’s $21.55. The S&P 500 rose 16% over the same period.
Wall Street has been reluctant to give much credit to one hit, on the theory that such success is hard to replicate. (“Barbie” has had no discernible impact on Warner Bros. Discovery’s stock price.)
But for Mattel, the positive impact of “Barbie” goes far beyond just one film. The company’s yearslong strategy to become a major film producer, using its vast storehouse of toys as intellectual property, had been met in Hollywood with skepticism, if not outright mockery. A-list talent wasn’t lining up to direct a plush purple dinosaur like Barney. But now the perception that Mattel’s leadership is willing to trust and support an unorthodox creative team that delivered both a box office bonanza and a possible awards contender has radically altered that.
And Mattel’s surprising willingness to make fun of itself was one of the elements that mostly delighted critics and added to the buzz that roped in many more moviegoers than the “Barbie” fan base.
That Kreiz was willing to laugh at his own caricature came as something as a surprise to some acquaintances and former colleagues. An Israeli military veteran with dual Israeli and British citizenship, a former professional wind surfer, an avid kite surfer and a fitness buff, with more than a passing resemblance to a younger Arnold Schwarzenegger, the 58-year-old Kreiz comes across as more of a square-jawed G.I. Joe action hero than a Barbie fan with a sense of humor.
Kreiz’s entire career was in media and entertainment, not retail. His longtime mentor, Power Rangers entrepreneur and billionaire Haim Saban, hired him fresh out of UCLA to launch Fox Kids Europe, a joint venture with Fox. He later ran Maker Studios, a YouTube aggregator, which Disney acquired in 2014. Kreiz left in 2016, and Maker was folded into the Disney Digital Network in 2017.
That “Barbie” even got made was no small feat. It had languished at Sony for years, with Mattel routinely renewing the option, as various writers struggled to adapt the doll for the big screen. Although one of the most popular toys ever, Barbie was the subject of intense controversy, seen both as a symbol of female empowerment and as an impossible standard of beauty and femininity. The only feasible approach seemed a parody. Comedian Amy Schumer was once slated for the part. But scripts came and went.
Weeks after becoming CEO in 2018, Kreiz refused to renew the Sony option, according to multiple people interviewed for this article. He called Robbie’s agent and asked for a meeting. Robbie was among the most sought-after young actors in Hollywood, fresh from acclaimed performances in diverse roles — as the ill-fated ice skater Tonya Harding in “I, Tonya”; in Martin Scorsese’s “The Wolf of Wall Street”; and as a fixture in Warner’s DC Comics universe as Harley Quinn, the Joker’s former girlfriend. And while no human could replicate Barbie’s exaggerated dimensions, Robbie came reasonably close, while also radiating wholesome beauty.
Robbie was simultaneously reaching out to Mattel and Kreiz after learning that the “Barbie” option hadn’t been renewed. She was looking for a potential franchise to take to Warner, where her production company, LuckyChap, had a first-look deal. But she wasn’t looking to star in the film herself.
Over breakfast at the Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills Hotel, the plush entertainment and celebrity hangout not far from Mattel’s less glamorous El Segundo headquarters, Kreiz shared his vision: He didn’t want to make movies in order just to sell toys. He wanted something fresh, unconventional, bold.
“Our vision for Barbie was someone with a strong voice, a clear message, with cultural resonance that would make a societal impact,” he said, recalling his message.
Kreiz’s obvious enthusiasm and determination, and his pitch for creative integrity make him hard to resist, as Brenner, a producer, discovered when he recruited her to run the newly created Mattel film division during another meal at the Polo Lounge. Brenner, a respected producer and an Academy Award nominee for “Dallas Buyers Club,” was attracted to his idea for the movie. In Kreiz’s vision, Mattel would be as much a movie company as a toy company. The two bonded after he asked her who should play Barbie, and she, too, volunteered Robbie.
At their first meeting, Robbie suggested Gerwig for the director. The two were friends and had talked about working together. Kreiz loved the idea in part because it was so unexpected — Gerwig had directed and written acclaimed but offbeat independent films like “Frances Ha,” “Lady Bird” and a new take on the classic “Little Women,” but no big-budget fare.
“Lady Bird” was one of Brenner’s favorite movies. But would Gerwig consider such a mass-market, commercial proposal?
Gerwig, it turned out, had played with Barbie dolls and loved them. She even had old photos of herself playing with Barbie. Brenner met with Gerwig and her partner, Noah Baumbach, also an acclaimed screenwriter and director, at an editing facility in New York. They kicked around a few ideas, but nothing concrete emerged. Anything seemed possible.
A deal was struck, and Warner signed on as co-producer. Once Gerwig was on board, Robbie agreed to star.
At which point Gerwig and Baumbach retreated. “I know it’s not conventional and not what you’re used to, but we have to go into a room for a few months. That’s how we work and want to do it,” as Gerwig put it, Kreiz recalled.
When the script did land in Brenner’s email, it was 147 pages — the length of a Quentin Tarantino film, epic by Hollywood standards. She closed her office door and started reading. “It was like going on this crazy ride,” she recalled. It broke rules, including the so-called fourth wall, addressing the audience directly. It poked fun at Mattel.
New to the company, Brenner didn’t know if this would prove too much for Mattel executives. But she believed it was a great script.
Brenner’s first call was to Kreiz. “I’ve read a lot of scripts, and this is so different,” she told him. “It’s special. You don’t get this feeling many times in an entire career.”
Kreiz read the script twice, back to back. “It was deep, provoking, unconventional and imaginative,” he said. “It was everything I was hoping it would be.”
Brenner was pleasantly surprised. “Ynon is a very confident person,” she said. “He can laugh at himself.”
At one point Kreiz flew to London, where “Barbie” sets were being built at Warner’s studio outside the city. He and Gerwig spent a half-hour discussing the perfect shade of pink.
Kreiz and Brenner knew they had a potential hit. “It was our secret that we couldn’t talk about,” Brenner recalled.
The original budget target of $80 million jumped above $120 million once Gerwig was signed. But even that wouldn’t realize the director’s full vision for the film. For Warner executives it was a struggle to find what are known as “comps,” similar films that had grossed enough to justify such an outlay.
Would “Barbie” be another “Charlie’s Angels” from 2019 — which was budgeted at $55 million but grossed only $73 million and, after marketing costs, lost money? Or another “Wonder Woman” from 2017, budgeted at over $100 million, with a worldwide gross of $822 million?
Eventually the budget hit $141 million and, with some reshoots, ultimately topped $150 million.
On opening night, July 21, Kreiz took his 19-year-old daughter to the Regal cinema complex at Union Square in New York City. As they neared the theater, droves of moviegoers — and not just young girls — were heading to it in pink outfits. Five screenings were in progress. All were sold out.
Kreiz and his daughter dropped in and out to gauge audience reactions. People laughed, applauded and in a few cases shed tears.
Of course the success of “Barbie” has drastically raised the bar — and expectations — for Mattel’s movies in development, starting with “Masters of the Universe,” written and directed by brothers Adam and Aaron Nee. Twelve more films are in various stages of development, including a “Hot Wheels” produced by J.J. Abrams, also at Warner. Some of these may need to be rethought.
And there will no doubt be “Barbie” sequels, perhaps even a James Bond-like franchise, which would be Kreiz’s ultimate fantasy (although he said it was too soon to discuss any such plans).
Kreiz acknowledged that in a notoriously fickle and unpredictable business, future success is hardly assured. But “Barbie” has given Mattel momentum — the beginning of what he calls “a multiyear franchise management strategy.”

Pence Calls Trump's Populism a 'Road to Ruin': [National Desk]

Full text: The former vice president used a speech in New Hampshire on Wednesday to call on Republicans to choose between conservatism and Donald Trump's brand of populism.
Former Vice President Mike Pence devoted an entire speech on Wednesday to what he called a "fundamental" and "unbridgeable" divide within the Republican Party -- the split between Reaganite conservatives like himself and propagators of populism like former President Donald J. Trump and his imitators.
Mr. Pence, who is polling in the single digits in the G.O.P. presidential primary race and lags far behind the front-runner Mr. Trump, has been warning about the dangers of populism for nearly a year. But his speech on Wednesday went further than he has gone before, casting Mr. Trump's populism as a "road to ruin."
"Should the new populism of the right seize and guide our party, the Republican Party as we have long known it will cease to exist," Mr. Pence said at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College in Manchester. "And the fate of American freedom would be in doubt."
In his plea to Republicans to abandon populism and embrace conservatism, Mr. Pence said that "we have come to a Republican time for choosing." The line echoed his hero Ronald Reagan's 1964 televised address, "A Time for Choosing," in which the former Hollywood actor framed that year's presidential election as a choice between individual freedom and governmental oppression.
"Republican voters face a choice," Mr. Pence said. "I believe that choice will determine both the fate of our party and the course of our nation for years to come."
He asked if the G.O.P. will be "the party of conservatism or will we follow the siren song of populism unmoored to conservative principles? The future of this movement and this party belongs to one or the other -- not both. That is because the fundamental divide between these two factions is unbridgeable."
Mr. Pence defined Republican populism as a trading away of time-honored principles for raw political power. He said populists trafficked in "personal grievances and performative outrage." And he said they would "abandon American leadership on the world stage," erode constitutional norms, jettison fiscal responsibility and wield the power of the government to punish their enemies.
He connected Mr. Trump's populist movement to a long line of progressive populists, including Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Huey Long, the former governor of Louisiana. He said that progressivism and Republican populism were "fellow travelers on the same road to ruin."
And Mr. Pence named names.
"Donald Trump, along with his imitators," he said, "often sound like an echo of the progressive they would replace in the White House."
In response to Mr. Pence's speech, Jason Miller, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, said in a statement, "President Trump's victory in 2016 exposed the massive divide between voters around the country and the establishment Beltway insiders who made terrible trade deals, allowed our southern border to become overrun and never missed an opportunity to play world cop. The conservative movement and the Republican Party have changed for the better, and nobody wants it to go back to the way it was before."
Mr. Pence, in his speech, also called out Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida for using state power to punish corporations for taking political stands he disagreed with -- a reference to Mr. DeSantis's efforts to strip Disney of its special tax status.
Mr. Pence said he understood the frustrations that had led to populist movements both on the left and the right. He listed income inequality caused by globalization and increased automation, the opioid epidemic and the cultural demonization of conservatives. He did not include on his list the invasion of Iraq -- which, unlike most Republicans, he still defends to this day.
But he glossed over his own role in promoting Trumpism as Mr. Trump's vice president as well as his traveling booster, a role Mr. Pence served throughout the 2016 campaign and all four years of the Trump presidency. Mr. Pence finally broke with him by refusing Mr. Trump's demand that he overturn the results of the presidential election on Jan. 6, 2021.
In Mr. Pence's telling, it is Mr. Trump who has changed. He said Mr. Trump ran as a conservative in 2016 and governed as one with Mr. Pence's help. But that story ignores inconvenient facts, including that the Trump-Pence administration added around $ 8 trillion to the national debt, enacted a protectionist trade policy and laid the groundwork for a complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan that Mr. Pence opposed.
The former vice president has woven warnings about populism into many of his speeches and off-the-cuff remarks since at least last October, when he condemned "Putin apologists" in the Republican Party. But at the first Republican debate last month in Milwaukee, the split between New Right populism and Reaganite conservatism came under a brighter spotlight in the onstage clashes between Mr. Pence and the businessman Vivek Ramaswamy.
In recent weeks, Mr. Pence and his team decided the subject was important enough to warrant its own speech, according to a person familiar with the planning, who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. His invocation of Mr. Reagan as an inspirational figure -- a common theme of Mr. Pence's speeches but done at length on Wednesday -- comes as Mr. Pence and other Republican presidential candidates prepare for their second debate, which will be held on Sept. 27 at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif.
As he extolled his hero, Mr. Pence all but pleaded for Republicans to remember there was a time before Mr. Trump. And that it was a time worth returning to.
"The truth is," he said, "the Republican Party did not begin on a golden escalator in 2015."

To Help Anxious Kids, Give Them More Freedom: [Op-Ed]

Full text: A colleague in suburban Kentucky let his 12-year-old daughter walk two houses down to her friend's place. At the end of the play date, the other girl's mom walked her home, just to be safe.
Such excessive caution is hardly unusual -- over the past several decades, children have become less and less independent. Instead of running outside to play after school or riding their bikes around "Stranger Things"-style, they're more likely to be indoors, on TikTok or in adult-run classes and organized sports.
Or, like the girl in Kentucky, protected from a danger that's all but nonexistent.
There are many reasons for this clampdown on kids, including the birth of cable TV in the 1980s, which evolved into round-the-clock internet news alerts, bringing a stream of scary news to parents. A gradual increase in homework started in the '80s, too, thanks to the fear that American kids were falling behind. And as the years went by, parents growing wary of a winner-take-all economy focused ever harder on getting their kids into college. They sprang for things like tutors and travel teams, giving kids a more curated, less autonomous childhood.
But as kids' freedom has been going down, their anxiety has been shooting up. The surgeon general has declared this "the crisis of our time." As a society, we've been trying everything from breathing exercises to therapeutic horse grooming to keep kids from shrinking from life.
While there could be many reasons our kids are suffering, what if the problem was simply that kids are growing up so overprotected that they're scared of the world?
If so, the solution would be simple, too: Start letting them do more things on their own.
This is exactly what the two of us have been studying. Lenore is a New York mom who let her 9-year-old ride the subway alone in 2008, wrote a column about it, got labeled America's Worst Mom and started the Free-Range Kids movement, which grew into Let Grow, a national nonprofit promoting childhood independence and resilience.
All the while, she has been monitoring the landscape of American childhood, talking to parents, teachers and kids, including 13-year-olds who've never been allowed to go to the park without an adult or run an errand or even cut their own meat. One 17-year-old told her he'd love to get pulled over for going 10 miles over the speed limit, because that, at least, would be on him. Alone, without parental help, he'd have to deal with the cop.
Camilo conducts research on treating kids with cognitive behavioral therapy. He also uses it in his practice and has witnessed the increase in children's anxiety since he started counseling them 15 years ago.
We both bemoan the fact that parents across the economic spectrum now believe that the more supervised, structured activities they can put their kids in, the better off they will be.
We think this constant supervision and intervention could be hurting kids' chances to become brave and resilient, and a recent Journal of Pediatrics article concurred. What's missing today isn't just the thrill of climbing trees or playing flashlight tag. It's that when an adult is always present -- in person or electronically -- kids never really get to see what they're made of. Kids should have a loving and secure relationship with their parents, of course. But if you think back to a time you were alone as a child and got lost or maybe fell off your bike, you probably still remember what happened next. You limped all the way home or asked a stranger for help. You managed. And that was a milestone.
Kids need a whole lot of those experiences. They are anxiety killers.
The Let Grow Project is a homework assignment we recommend schools give to students so they can learn to tackle more things on their own. The instructions tell kids to go home and ask their parents if they can do something new by themselves (or with a friend), like walk the dog, run an errand, make the family breakfast -- just something they feel ready to do but haven't done yet.
Teachers and parents have told us that kids' confidence starts climbing when they participate. For instance, a seventh-grade boy pushed himself to go on a ride at Disney World -- something he'd been too scared to do before. After braving the child-friendly Slinky Dog Dash, there was no stopping him: He went on ride after ride. Another seventh grader, a girl who was afraid to try out for the swim team, decided to start by walking to church by herself. That made her feel very grown up. Then she got her ears pierced (with her parents' permission). Then she started doing CVS runs for her mom, which made her feel responsible. And then, yes, she tried out for the swim team (and made it).
Sometimes the impact is a little goofier. Ever since her elementary school started doing the Let Grow Project, one principal told Lenore, "fewer kids are sticking their feet out."
"They'd been tripping each other?" Lenore asked.
No, said the principal, "fewer kids are asking their teacher to tie their shoes."
This was the dream of Let Grow: Give kids their independence and watch them blossom. But the uptake has not been as fast as Lenore would like. A lot of schools want data, not anecdotes.
Enter Camilo. He'd heard about Let Grow and offered to test independence as therapy in a clinical setting. He was already practicing exposure therapy, in which you have clients confront their fears. But this was a radical reconceptualization of the treatment. Instead of saying, "I hear you're afraid to sleep in your own bed -- how about trying that tonight?" now he would ask, "What cool things would you like to do on your own?"
Using this technique, he and his doctoral student Matthew Fastman treated five patients, ages 9 to 14, who were diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. And despite the kids' worries, it turned out there were many things they did want to try alone: Going to the grocery store. Taking the bus. One wanted to take his little brother to a carnival.
The intervention required five office (or Zoom) visits with the parents and child. The kids each did about 10 to 20 new things on their own.
The result was that all five children went from saying they felt worried most of the time to saying they felt worried a little bit of the time.
Statistically, this independence therapy worked better than drugs. And faster than cognitive behavioral therapy.
Of course, because it was a pilot study of just five kids, we can't make too much of the results. And it's doubtful any psychological intervention will ever work universally. But the results suggest that more study is merited. Now Camilo is planning a larger randomized controlled trial, and we hope others will begin researching how wide-ranging the benefits could be and what might be going on neurologically.
The beauty is that we don't have to wait for results before kids can try out more independence. The Let Grow Project is free, and so is Camilo's manual for clinicians.
Giving kids more freedom could be the cheapest, fastest and easiest way to give kids back the bounce they've lost.
Camilo Ortiz is an associate professor of psychology at Long Island University, Post, who runs a private psychology practice on Long Island. Lenore Skenazy is the president of the nonprofit Let Grow and the author of "Free-Range Kids."

The Real Y.A. Writers of Provo, Utah: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A tight-knit community of young-adult writers who belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has yielded smashes like "Twilight." But religious doctrine can clash with creative freedoms.
American book-reading habits have been in decline for decades, but you wouldn't know it from sitting in on a young-adult literature class held last winter at Brigham Young University.
The professor, Chris Crowe, arrived to the classroom with a box full of books. When he announced they were free for the taking, some two dozen students rushed to the table.
There were reminders that the class was taking place at "the Lord's university," as B.Y.U. is known in the Mormon world. (The university is owned and run by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.) Class began with a student-led prayer, and the syllabus cited the school's mission statement: "The full realization of each student's divine potential is our central focus."
But the reading list consisted of mainstream titles any fan of Y.A. fiction would recognize, like "The Outsiders" by S.E. Hinton and "Speak" by Laurie Halse Anderson. And the discussion, which that day focused on "Make Lemonade," Virginia Euwer Wolff's verse novel about two teenagers living in poverty, came to a familiar head.
To Laurel Scott, a senior from Sachse, Texas, the book's main characters -- Jolly, a 17-year-old single mother of two young children, and LaVaughn, a 14-year-old who becomes their babysitter -- seemed rather adult. They were leading difficult lives, and yet, when they got upset, they didn't let their emotions erupt. "Neither protagonist acted like what I would expect a teenager to act," Ms. Scott said. "The story just didn't read to me like a Y.A. novel."
Andrea Amado-Fajardo, a senior from the Bay Area, raised her hand. "But I think we have to take into account LaVaughn's circumstances," she said. "When I read this book, I was like, 'These were my teenage years.' This is what it was like to not have generational wealth."
Her voice started to shake. "Sorry, I don't want to get emotional, but, like, this is how it is. This isn't 'The Hunger Games.' This isn't a dystopian novel. This is just the fact of the matter. People who don't have generational wealth are forced to grow up faster."
'The Hero's Journey'
Latter-day Saints are some of the most enthusiastic readers of Y.A. and genre fiction in the country. And many become fiction writers themselves, aided by a tight network of writing programs, conferences, workshops and publishers in the Latter-day Saints community.
B.Y.U. is an incubator, and the young-adult class currently taught by Mr. Crowe, English 420 -- a literature course, as opposed to a creative-writing course -- has been around since 1958, predating by almost a decade the publication of "The Outsiders," a turning point in the evolution of contemporary Y.A.
The literary scene in Utah fosters a workaday approach to fiction writing, akin to that of the songwriting rooms of Nashville, and it has produced some juggernauts. Stephenie Meyer, whose "Twilight" series has sold more than 100 million copies, is a Latter-day Saint and B.Y.U. graduate. So is the sci-fi and fantasy author Brandon Sanderson. His Kickstarter campaign to self-publish four novels he wrote during the pandemic raised more than $ 41 million last year.
Mormon authors who have written best sellers include Ally Condie, author of the "Matched" trilogy, and Shannon Hale, author of the "Princess Academy" series. Orson Scott Card, who wrote "Ender's Game," is a B.Y.U. graduate and a great-great-grandson of Brigham Young. The 1971 best seller "Go Ask Alice," billed as the real diary of a teenage drug addict, was actually written by a Mormon housewife, Beatrice Sparks.
Mr. Sanderson now teaches a creative-writing class at B.Y.U. and runs Dragonsteel Books, a publishing company he founded in Provo, Utah. He attributes the robust output of Latter-day Saint fiction writers to an especially supportive literary culture, but also to an emphasis on reading in their homes, a view shared by many of the two dozen authors, educators and publishing professionals interviewed for this article. "A lot of L.D.S. folks grow up with their parents having them read the Scriptures," Mr. Sanderson said.
He added that the visibility in sci-fi and fantasy is striking in part because the genres are not associated with religious temperaments. "When people find out that Stephenie Meyer, who wrote vampire books, is L.D.S., they're like, 'Whaaaaaat? That doesn't mesh with my view in my head of a conservative religious community."'
If outsiders regard sci-fi and fantasy as incongruous with the faith, many writers who are church members don't. "Fantasy is often a way that you can explore ideas of, you know, trust in something bigger," said Rosalyn Eves, an author of five Y.A. novels that blend fantasy and romance with historical fiction. "I've always felt like religious faith and belief in miracles is not all that different from magic in some ways."
This sentiment was echoed by Chris Schoebinger, the publishing director of Shadow Mountain, an imprint of Deseret Book (the publishing arm of the church).
"One of the core doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is what's called the plan of salvation," Mr. Schoebinger said. "Which takes us from, first, living with our father in heaven, and then coming to Earth, going through this battle for good and evil, this atonement where we're changed, and then returning to God, or wherever we started, a changed person. That is the hero's journey."
Mr. Schoebinger is known for discovering the New York Times best-selling fantasy author Brandon Mull, who offered another reason writers in the church are drawn to middle-grade and Y.A. fiction. "Big families," he said by phone from his home in Highland, north of Provo. "We grow up with that kind of stuff. Disney's huge in this community. All things family entertainment is pretty big."
Every author said that a key reason Latter-day Saints tend to write for teenagers and children is a church-encouraged distaste for explicit material that can be found in adult fiction. They prefer to write books that are "clean" -- the church's term for content that doesn't contain graphic sex or violence. It's one reason Mr. Mull sticks to middle-grade, he said: "I'm like a little kid that way. I like an old-timey classic adventure story."
The preference for clean fiction is shared by adult readers in the church community, said Gene Nelson, a longtime director of the Provo City Library. "There's a lot of people who are tired of the detailed sexuality and violence that occurs in a lot of adult fiction," he said. "They don't want to see the F word bandied about. When the book almost becomes erotica at some point, where do they go? They go to Y.A. fiction."
The church doesn't issue official guidelines for what constitutes clean fiction, but the Provo City Library has a description on the cover of its "So Fresh! So Clean!" booklet -- a list of its approved books -- warning, in part: "Books on this list may have some occurrences of the tamest expletives. Sexual references might occur but nothing explicit."
The histories of Mormon publishing, church-backed children's education and Utah statehood are intertwined in the biography of one early settler.
George Q. Cannon, a writer from England, was among the first Mormons to arrive in the Salt Lake Valley, in 1847. He became the church's chief storyteller in the West. He edited, and at one point owned, The Deseret News in Salt Lake City. He started a weekly church newspaper in San Francisco.
He was also the first general superintendent of the church's Sunday schools. Mr. Cannon editorialized against "trashy" literature, which he said was one of the greatest threats to the religious education of young people. (Brigham Young said novels were "falsehoods got up expressly to excite the minds of youth.") To spread "uplifting" stories, Mr. Cannon created the church's first magazine for children, Juvenile Instructor, and later founded the bookstore and press that became Deseret Book.
Mormons started writing fiction in greater numbers in the 1880s in what's known as the "home-literature movement," spurred when church leaders, still vexed by the growing popularity of novels, called on Latter-day Saints to write their own. "We will yet have Miltons and Shakespeares of our own," the apostle Orson F. Whitney declared.
Today Deseret Book comprises three imprints, 40 bookstores, a record company and a film distribution company called Excel Entertainment. Its corporate offices are in a complex of glass buildings not far from Temple Square in Salt Lake City.
Deseret's main imprint publishes Scripture, church curriculum, inspirational guides for missionaries, self-help, biographies and histories. Shadow Mountain, the general trade imprint, has a different mission: to publish "values based" fiction and nonfiction that may appeal to readers who don't share the same faith.
The imprint was established in 1985, Mr. Schoebinger said, but a turning point came in the early 2000s, when a survey revealed that customers were reading "Harry Potter" books in droves. Editors combed the slush pile for fantasy manuscripts. Shadow Mountain soon had a best seller with "Fablehaven," Mr. Mull's first book, about an enchanted refuge for magical creatures.
When "Fifty Shades of Grey" came out (itself inspired in part by "Twilight"), Mr. Schoebinger and his colleagues wondered if they could find a market for G-rated romance, an opportunity other publishers had also tapped with chaste books. "We wanted a book that mothers and daughters could read together and just feel good about," he said. The result was Proper Romance, Shadow Mountain's line of clean romance novels.
Shadow Mountain has had more than 10 books on one of the New York Times's best-seller lists. Many are by Mr. Mull. Another is "The Romney Family Table," a cookbook by Ann Romney.
The Church and Gay Rights
Since the "Twilight"-fueled boom of the 2000s, it has become more common for contemporary Y.A. to contain sex and violence. This shift was on display at the King's English, a popular independent bookstore in Salt Lake City. There, steamy novels like "A Court of Thorns and Roses" by Sarah J. Maas, about a teenage huntress who falls in love with her faerie captor, sell fast.
This means less compatibility between Latter-day Saint writers and mainstream Y.A. readers, said Margaret Brennan Neville, the store's longtime buyer for Y.A. and children's books.
She said novels like "Felix Ever After" by Kacen Callender, about a Black trans teenager, and "Camp" by L.C. Rosen, about a summer camp for queer teenagers, were also sought after.
Latter-day Saints doctrine officially declares same-sex relationships sinful. "The church distinguishes between same-sex attraction and homosexual behavior," its policy states. "People who experience same-sex attraction or identify as gay, lesbian or bisexual can make and keep covenants with God and fully and worthily participate in the church." People who act on same-sex attraction, however, cannot. "Sexual relations are reserved for a man and woman who are married and promise complete loyalty to each other."
There appears to be evidence of a correlation between the church's treatment of L.G.B.T.Q. members and research showing that younger Latter-day Saints are leaving the church.
Jana Riess provides an overview of the data in her 2019 book, "The Next Mormons: How Millennials Are Changing the LDS Church." Even the rosiest picture, she wrote in The Salt Lake Tribune, referring to data from Pew Research Center, shows a drop in the church's retention rate among millennials. The General Social Survey found a sharper decline. According to polling by Ms. Riess, the church's position on L.G.B.T.Q. issues ranks seventh out of 30 reasons that former Mormons cite for leaving the church. Among millennials who have left, it's third.
In fact, six of the authors who were contacted for this article responded that they were no longer active in the church.
One, Matt Kirby, said his allegiance to the church started to crack when his brother came out as gay in the late '90s. "There was no question that my family and I would continue to love him no matter what," Mr. Kirby said. "My concern was: In this context, in this religious context, what will it mean for him?" The breaking point for Mr. Kirby was the church's push to pass Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in California. (It was later struck down.)
Kiersten White, who has written more than 20 books for young adults and children, including "The Dark Descent of Elizabeth Frankenstein," also cited the church's support for Proposition 8.
"One of the things that Mormonism teaches you is that everyone is entitled to personal revelation, that you have a direct line to God," Ms. White said. "He'll either give you a burning in your bosom if things are correct or a stupor of thought if things are incorrect. I still remember being at my polling place, looking down at my ballot, and knowing that our church had not only campaigned for Prop 8 and donated significant amounts of money, but specifically over the pulpit asked us to vote for it. And I felt sick."
For Mette Ivie Harrison, the church's opposition to gay rights was one of many factors. Her faith first began to unravel when she lost a baby in a full-term stillbirth, in 2005. "I kept wanting to find an answer to why God had chosen that thing to happen to me," Ms. Harrison said.
Until then an author of fantasy romances for young adults, Ms. Harrison started writing "The Bishop's Wife," an adult mystery published in 2014. The story involved domestic abuse, and its protagonist, Linda, a devout Mormon, experiences doubts about some church beliefs. Deseret Book did not carry it in its stores.
"The Bishop's Wife" was received positively outside church channels, including a review by Janet Maslin in The Times. HuffPost asked Ms. Harrison to write a column about Mormonism. She did, and her essays drew the attention of a group called the Strengthening Church Members Committee, she said.
Ms. Harrison's local bishop called her in to discuss the articles. The conversation was friendly, she said, and she was not threatened with discipline. But she found it unsettling that her writing had been flagged by a church committee. A spokesman for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints declined to comment for this article.
In 2015, the church passed its so-called November Policy, which declared members in same-sex marriages apostates and barred their children from being baptized. At that time, Ms. Harrison had close family friends in the church community who had a child who had come out as transgender. To signal that she was in mourning over the church's treatment of L.G.B.T.Q. members, Ms. Harrison started wearing black clothes and a rainbow ribbon to church.
Although the November Policy was later reversed, Ms. Harrison stopped attending church in 2019.
A 'Forced Innocence'
It's unclear how often fiction writers are pressured by the church to change their work. When it happens, it happens in private. But one fiction writer, Brian Evenson, did have a public confrontation with B.Y.U. in the '90s.
Mr. Evenson was teaching creative writing at the university when his first book, "Altmann's Tongue," a collection of horror stories, came out. A student objected to the violence in the stories on moral grounds. "I feel like someone who has eaten something poisonous," the student wrote in an anonymous letter to church leaders. This prompted a review of Mr. Evenson's book.
He was informed that he could not publish another book like "Altmann's Tongue" and keep his job at B.Y.U. He resigned. "The pressure was, if I want to keep on writing and not have to constantly be thinking about these people who want me to be writing in a different way, I've got to leave," Mr. Evenson said by phone from his home in Santa Clarita, Calif.
He soon started writing a novel that was more directly about Mormonism than any of his past work had been. "One thing that happens when you grow up Mormon is that you have this system of self-censorship that's built in," Mr. Evenson said.
The novel, "Father of Lies," which came out in 1998, has been described as a "patriarchal horror." Mr. Evenson ultimately resigned from the church in 2000.
Ms. White, the prolific teen horror and paranormal romance author, said she was never pressured by the church, but her writing did change after she left. Previously, she wrote fiction for young adults and children. She has since written two novels for adults.
"There's this sort of forced innocence," Ms. White said of being a devout Mormon. "Even though you're an adult and you have children, you have to engage with and move through the world in a P.G. way, as though you are still a child."
Her second novel for adults, "Mister Magic," was published in August. It's about a religious sect in the desert in Utah.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The apartment sold at 220 Central Park South, a.k.a. the city's most expensive building. The Woolworth Building also sold a penthouse, for $ 30 million, well below the asking price.
The year's most expensive sale in New York City took place in August at 220 Central Park South in Midtown, where an expansive duplex in the villa portion of the park-facing condo complex closed at $ 80 million.
The apartment, occupying the eighth and ninth floors of the 18-story villa building, was sold to an anonymous buyer by an entity linked to Nima Capital, the investment firm founded by Suna Said. A studio in the main tower was also part of the deal.
Other big August closings included the penthouse at the pinnacle of the landmark Woolworth Building in TriBeCa. It sold for $ 30 million, far less than the $ 110 million initially sought by the developers six years ago. The buyer was Scott Lynn, an art collector and the founder and chief executive of Masterworks, an art investment platform.
The crown penthouse at the new 20-story condo at 109 East 79th Street also sold, for $ 35 million, which was the month's second biggest sale. The full-floor unit has 5,721 square feet, plus an additional 3,666 square feet of outdoor space. The buyer was listed as 79 XTS L.L.C.
Elsewhere downtown, the art director Fabien Baron sold his 19th-century Greenwich Village townhouse, and Daniel S. Glaser, the former head of the insurance services giant Marsh McLennan, bought a duplex in the Flatiron district.
Randy Lerner, the billionaire investor and former owner of the Cleveland Browns football team, purchased the Fifth Avenue duplex of Daniel Humm, a Swiss-born chef and restaurateur.
And in Brooklyn, the award-winning songwriters Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, responsible for the catchy "Let it Go" ballad from Disney's "Frozen," bought two apartments at a new development in Dumbo. Each came with a parking spot.
The 220 Central Park South duplex purchased for $ 80 million is currently the priciest sale in the 10-unit building, which sits adjacent to the 70-story main tower. It was first sold for nearly $ 65.6 million in the fall of 2020.
The new owner's identity was shielded by the limited liability company 220CPSV8.
The villa apartment measures 7,911 square feet and includes six bedrooms and seven and a half bathrooms. Plus, there are an additional 1,095 square feet of outdoor space, providing up-close Central Park views.
While the sale was the city's top transaction (so far) in 2023 and the most expensive in its building, it is hardly the biggest sale in the entire limestone complex, located near Columbus Circle. (In fact, it's just the sixth.) In early 2019, the hedge fund manager Kenneth C. Griffin famously closed on four unfinished floors in the tower, paying almost $ 240 million, a national record for a single residence.
Speaking of unfinished, the penthouse that sold for $ 30 million at what is known as the Woolworth Tower Residences, at 2 Park Place, was also a so-called white-box purchase, without interior walls or finishes. Mr. Lynn, its new owner, is currently working on building plans, according to a spokesman for Masterworks, and "expects construction on the property to take three years."
He'll certainly have plenty of space to work with (and to showcase his art collection). The unit, known as the Pinnacle Penthouse, is roughly 12,100 square feet, contained within the 1913 neo-Gothic building's copper peak on the 49th and 50th floors. There's also a 408-square-foot observatory terrace, providing breathtaking panoramic views of New York City, and it comes with a private elevator.
All 32 units at the top of the 58-story Woolworth Building, named for the discount-store pioneer Frank Winfield Woolworth, have now been sold by the developer, Alchemy Properties. The Pinnacle Penthouse had been listed for as much as $ 110 million in 2017, but with no takers was reduced over the years, with its most recent price tag at $ 59 million.
Mr. Baron got $ 18 million for his townhouse at 55 West Ninth Street, between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas in the Greenwich Village Historic District.
The buyer used the limited liability company Rainey Rondellio, registered in Wyoming, in the transaction.
The five-story, 22-foot-wide brick and brownstone townhouse was built around 1840 and fully renovated in a classical and modern aesthetic. The 4,662-square-foot home has four bedrooms and three and a half bathrooms, along with ample outdoor space, including a meticulously landscaped rear garden off the kitchen (a great place for early fall soirees) and a terrace off the library on the parlor floor.
The spacious living room is anchored by a fireplace, and the primary bedroom suite takes up the entire top floor and features two walk-in closets and a roomy bathroom.
Mr. Baron is the founder of Baron & Baron, a boutique advertising agency specializing in fashion, fragrance and cosmetics luxury brands like Calvin Klein, Fendi and Michael Kors.
In the Flatiron district, at 45 East 22nd Street, a.k.a. the Madison Square Park Tower, Mr. Glaser paid $ 14.5 million for a duplex -- with gorgeous views everywhere. He was president and chief executive of Marsh McLellan until the end of last year.
The 5,866-square-foot apartment has four bedrooms, four full bathrooms and a powder room. A great room on the main floor is equipped with a wet bar and lined with floor-to-ceiling windows that provide sweeping vistas of the city, the East River, and beyond. Even the laundry room and the enormous walk-in closet in the primary bedroom suite have nice views.
The primary suite, which takes up the top level, also features a spalike marble bathroom with heated floors and a separate soaking tub that looks out onto the cityscape. Who needs artwork in this place?
Mr. Lerner, who owned the Cleveland Browns from 2002 to 2012, inheriting the team after the death of his father, paid $ 17 million for Mr. Humm's duplex at 40 Fifth Avenue in the heart of Greenwich Village. The neo-Georgian apartment house was built in the late 1920s on the corner of West 11th Street, just a few blocks from Washington Square Park.
Because the property was not listed publicly, there were few details about this co-op apartment, other than the bedroom and bathroom count (five and five and a half).
Mr. Humm, an owner of the highly rated restaurant Eleven Madison Park, earned a tidy profit on the duplex sale, having bought it just a couple of years ago for $ 14.5 million.
The Lopezes spent a total of $ 11.3 million for two adjacent apartments at Olympia Dumbo, a new condominium development at 30 Front Street, presumably to combine.
Both units, just blocks from Brooklyn Bridge Park, offer stunning views of the bridge and Manhattan and New York Harbor, along with parking spaces.
The larger of the two apartments, which sold for $ 7.6 million, extends 2,849 square feet, and contains four bedrooms and three and a half bathrooms. It also comes with a 404-square foot terrace off the great room.
The other unit, closing at $ 3.7 million, measures 1,485 square feet, with two bedrooms and two bathrooms.
The songwriting couple will need all the room they can get to display their numerous awards accumulated over the years, including a Grammy and Oscar for "Let it Go" and an Oscar for "Remember Me," from the animated film "Coco."
Mr. Lopez is also part of the rarefied EGOT club, winning an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony.

On 1,000 Planets, High Expectations: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: Starfield almost immediately nudges its players to the edges of the cosmos. In the opening hours of the role-playing video game, it's possible to land your spaceship on Earth's moon or zip 16 light-years from a remote outpost to Alpha Centauri. When you open your map and zoom out from a planet, you can behold its surrounding solar system; zoom out again, and you're scrolling past luminous stars and the mysterious worlds that orbit them.
That sprawling celestial journey within Starfield, developed by Bethesda Game Studios, reveals both the tremendous potential and the monumental challenge of an open-world space adventure. Bethesda has hyped an expansive single-player campaign with 1,000 explorable planets. And expectations around the game, officially releasing on Sept. 6 after a 10-month delay, are nearly as vast.
It's the first new universe in 25 years for Bethesda, known for the Elder Scrolls and Fallout series. It's also a high-stakes moment for Microsoft, which makes the Xbox and has long faced criticism that it produces fewer hit games than its console rivals, Sony and Nintendo. To compete, Microsoft went on a spending spree, acquiring Bethesda's parent company in 2020 and agreeing to purchase Activision Blizzard in 2022, a $ 69 billion bet that is being challenged by regulators.
Now Bethesda must deliver. Known for letting players navigate competing factions and undertake eccentric quests, the studio hopes Starfield will dazzle those clamoring for engaging encounters with alien life-forms or space mercenaries as well as a sense of boundless exploration.
But creating a game the size of a galaxy is extraordinarily time-consuming and expensive, and several past attempts that shot for the stars failed to stick the landing.
"The biggest challenge you face when building any sci-fi game is the almost limitless imagination as players we have about space and about the universe," said Aaryn Flynn, the chief executive of Inflexion Games and a former general manager of BioWare, which makes the sci-fi Mass Effect series. "Players want that captured in the experience."
Todd Howard, the executive producer of Bethesda, was well aware that Starfield, which is being released for Windows computers and the Xbox Series X and S, would have to be expansive to reflect the allure of space travel.
"All of us, I think, at some point look to the sky and say, 'Man, I wonder what it would be like to blast off and land on the moon?' or 'I wonder what would be beyond that?' or 'What's in that star?' or 'Is there life out there?"' Howard said in an interview, adding: "We needed the scale to have that feeling. We could have made a game where there are four cities and four planets. But that would not have the same feeling of being this explorer."
So Starfield has promised 1,000 searchable planets, about 10 percent of which contain life in addition to quests and valuable raw materials. That scale has caused some concern that the studio responsible for glitchy releases like Skyrim and Fallout 76 is in over its head -- and that some aspects of space will be a black hole of fun.
The game's developers say they are confident they have struck the right balance by using a mix of scientific data and artificial intelligence to generate realistic planets, and then fine-tuning those worlds with human programmers who also craft the quests and the enemies that players will encounter.
"We have artists who hand-built the rocks, partly from scanning real rocks in our world and changing them," Howard said. "And then we have algorithms that create the landscape of a planet and put the rocks and the trees in all the right places."
When players land on a new planet in Starfield, they may encounter a tangle of atlas weed or discover that giant crabs can viciously attack. Those who enjoy hoarding can pick up items as innocuous as a jar of sealant in an abandoned laboratory.
But exactly how the game unfolds will differ for each player. Howard acknowledged that Starfield posed "an incredibly difficult design challenge" -- one his team tried to solve by building a planet content manager that allows certain quests to be placed as players reach the surface. One player might run into a derelict outpost; someone else might hear another spaceship's engine as she wanders. Developers have also tried to ensure that very little will happen in some cases, so that players "get some periods of loneliness," Howard said.
Despite the technological advancements that have made it possible to generate countless planets with ease, more than a dozen gaming executives, analysts and developers said in interviews that studios must be wary of overpromising what they can deliver.
No Man's Sky drew incredible hype when its developers at Hello Games spoke of a procedurally generated universe of no fewer than 18 quintillion planets. But when the game made its debut in 2016, players found its worlds uninteresting and its alien dinosaurs crude. The criticism was so harsh that one of the company's founders said he received death threats; the independent studio was investigated for false advertising and eventually cleared.
"Procedural generation can generate new maps but not compelling gameplay," said Elena Bertozzi, a professor of game design and development at Quinnipiac University. "No Man's Sky had a lot of planets with nothing interesting going on."
A spokesman for Hello Games declined to comment, referring to public remarks that one of its founders, Sean Murray, made in 2019. By then, the game had improved and was being praised for its successful postrelease updates.
"Innovation is in such short supply in the industry, and we need it so badly," Murray said at the time. "We need to encourage it, we need to foster it. We need to ask people to shoot for the moon. And if they fail on their first attempt, we need to be there to support them."
The team behind Mass Effect: Andromeda, the fourth installment in the role-playing series, also planned to leverage procedural generation, said Mac Walters, who worked for BioWare for almost two decades as a writer, producer and director and joined the Andromeda project partway through.
"There was this vision that we were going to have a thousand planets," Walters said, confirming some details of an investigation into what the gaming news site Kotaku called a "turbulent and troubled" development. When Andromeda was released in 2017, there were about a half-dozen planets to explore.
BioWare did not respond to a request for comment. Flynn, the studio's former general manager, said the team was hamstrung by decisions such as the choice to use the Frostbite game engine, which was not intended for content-heavy role-playing games. He said the team had hoped to have enough sophistication in its algorithms to make the procedurally generated worlds "indistinguishable" from what developers were making, so that they could focus on building a transporting narrative.
"We didn't get there," he said. "And so our developers still had to come over and work on the procedural content a fair bit."
When players finally got their hands on the game, many were shocked by its lack of polish. The characters' facial animations were so clumsy, they became fodder for internet memes. Critics assailed what they described as cheesy dialogue, subpar voice acting and major plot problems.
Avoiding similar pitfalls with Starfield is paramount for Microsoft, which desperately needs a new blockbuster game as its flagship franchise, Halo, fades in relevance. Some time after Bethesda announced an open-world space game in 2018, Microsoft executives learned that Sony was considering a deal to make it available exclusively on PlayStation consoles.
"When we heard that Starfield was going to potentially end up skipping Xbox -- we can't be in a position as a third-place console where we fall further behind on console ownership," Phil Spencer, the chief executive of Microsoft Gaming, testified during a court hearing in June that focused on the Activision acquisition. "We had to secure content to remain viable."
Microsoft shelled out $ 7.5 billion for ZeniMax Media, the parent company of a swath of game studios that included Bethesda, but is still looking for a return on investment. Redfall, the most prominent Xbox game resulting from the deal so far, flopped when it was released in May.
Xbox owners have also been denied a seat at this year's feast of role-playing games, including Final Fantasy XVI, which is currently available only on the PlayStation 5, and Tears of the Kingdom, a Zelda game for the Switch. Baldur's Gate 3, which has been rapturously received by computer gamers, hits the PlayStation 5 on Wednesday; an Xbox version is due later this year.
Microsoft has pioneered a shift in gaming away from $ 60 or $ 70 retail purchases and toward a Netflix-style subscription service that offers hundreds of games for between $ 10 and $ 17 per month. That service, Game Pass, had more than 25 million subscribers last year but needs a steady supply of marquee games to make it a can't-miss subscription.
If Starfield wins over players, "it becomes a crowning jewel in that portfolio," said Yung Kim, the head of partnerships at the gaming data firm Aldora and a former analyst for Piper Sandler.
Spencer said he would measure Starfield's success simply by how many people play it, regardless of how they do so. "Everything comes from that. How many people are playing across devices?" he wrote in an email. "I want Starfield to be Bethesda Game Studios' most played game ever."
Starfield draws inspiration from movies and television shows like "Interstellar," "Battlestar Galactica" and "The Martian," Howard said, but also from real organizations like NASA and Elon Musk's SpaceX. The game's main story focuses on collecting mysterious alien artifacts and can be completed in about 30 hours. But players can spend hundreds more customizing spaceships, harvesting resources, exploring planets and fighting bloodthirsty pirates.
Focusing on realism helped ground the project, Bethesda executives said. Engineers toured NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, which Ashley Cheng, Bethesda's managing director, said helped inspire Starfield's realistic simulation of the galaxy -- down to how quickly a planet rotates around its axis. The trip also helped set parameters on Starfield's procedural generation of planets to ensure that their geography was realistic.
All of the names, locations and characteristics of Starfield planets are the same for every player. Some are temperate, made of rock and filled with fauna and flora. Others are gas giants in a deep freeze that cannot be landed on. Still others have chemical water, low gravity or a surface so hot it emits scalding vapor fog. (Earth, in 2330, is essentially a desert filled with corrosive gas.)
"They all have different biomes," Angela Browder, Bethesda's studio director, said. "We all have this idea of what space is supposed to be like. Whatever you thought it was going to look like, we probably have a planet that matches up."
Browder said developers also had to weigh realism against enjoyment. Survival in space needed to be challenging, but not too burdensome. The team ditched the idea of making players refuel their spaceships, and tried to make the controls for piloting them accessible.
Their desire for accuracy also kept expectations in check. Cheng said part of the balance was making sure there was enough to do without jam-packing all 1,000 planets with content. Not every location, he said, "is supposed to be Disney World."
"The point of the vastness of space is you should feel small. It should feel overwhelming," Cheng said. "Everyone's concerned that empty planets are going to be boring. But when the astronauts went to the moon, there was nothing there. They certainly weren't bored."

PROVO, Utah — American book-reading habits have been in decline for decades, but you wouldn’t know it from sitting in on a young adult literature class held in the winter at Brigham Young University. The professor, Chris Crowe, arrived with a box full of books. When he announced they were free for the taking, some two dozen students rushed to the table.
There were reminders that the class was taking place at “the Lord’s university,” as BYU is known in the Mormon world. (The university is owned and run by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.) Class began with a student-led prayer, and the syllabus cited the school’s mission statement: “The full realization of each student’s divine potential is our central focus.”
But the reading list consisted of mainstream titles any YA fiction fan would recognize, like “The Outsiders,” by S.E. Hinton; and “Speak,” by Laurie Halse Anderson. And the discussion, which that day focused on “Make Lemonade,” Virginia Euwer Wolff’s verse novel about two teenagers living in poverty, came to a familiar head.
To Laurel Scott, a senior from Sachse, Texas, the book’s main characters — Jolly, a 17-year-old single mother of two, and LaVaughn, their 14-year-old babysitter — seemed rather adult. Their lives were difficult, and yet, when they got upset, they didn’t let their emotions erupt. “Neither protagonist acted like what I would expect a teenager to act,” Scott said. “The story just didn’t read to me like a YA novel.”
Andrea Amado-Fajardo, a senior from the San Francisco Bay Area, raised her hand. “But I think we have to take into account LaVaughn’s circumstances,” she said. “When I read this book, I was like, ‘These were my teenage years.’ This is what it was like to not have generational wealth.”
Her voice started to shake. “Sorry, I don’t want to get emotional, but, like, this is how it is. This isn’t ‘The Hunger Games.’ This isn’t a dystopian novel. This is just the fact of the matter. People who don’t have generational wealth are forced to grow up faster.”
‘The Hero’s Journey’
Latter-day Saints are some of the most enthusiastic readers of YA and genre fiction in the country. And many become fiction writers themselves, aided by a network of writing programs, conferences, workshops and publishers in the community.
BYU is an incubator, and the young adult class currently taught by Crowe, English 420 — a literature course, as opposed to creative writing — has been around since 1958, predating by almost a decade “The Outsiders,” a turning point in the evolution of contemporary YA.
The literary scene in Utah fosters a workaday approach to fiction writing, akin to that of the songwriting rooms of Nashville, Tennessee, and it has produced some juggernauts. Stephenie Meyer, whose “Twilight” series has sold over 100 million copies, is a Latter-day Saint and BYU graduate. So is sci-fi and fantasy author Brandon Sanderson. His Kickstarter campaign to self-publish four novels he wrote during the pandemic raised more than $41 million last year.
Mormon authors who have written bestsellers include Ally Condie, author of the “Matched” trilogy, and Shannon Hale, author of the “Princess Academy” series. Orson Scott Card, who wrote “Ender’s Game,” is a BYU graduate and a great-great-grandson of Brigham Young. The 1971 bestseller “Go Ask Alice,” billed as the real diary of a teenage drug addict, was actually written by a Mormon housewife, Beatrice Sparks.
Sanderson now teaches a creative-writing class at BYU and runs Dragonsteel Books, a publishing company he founded in Provo, Utah. He attributes the robust output of Latter-day Saint fiction writers to an especially supportive literary culture but also to an emphasis on reading in their homes, a view shared by many of the two dozen authors, educators and publishing professionals interviewed for this article. “A lot of LDS folks grow up with their parents having them read the Scriptures,” Sanderson said.
He added that the visibility in sci-fi and fantasy is striking in part because the genres are not associated with religious temperaments. “When people find out that Stephenie Meyer, who wrote vampire books, is LDS, they’re like, ‘Whaaaaaat? That doesn’t mesh with my view in my head of a conservative religious community.’”
If outsiders regard sci-fi and fantasy as incongruous with the faith, many writers who are church members don’t. “Fantasy is often a way that you can explore ideas of, you know, trust in something bigger,” said Rosalyn Eves, an author of several YA novels that blend fantasy and romance with historical fiction. “I’ve always felt like religious faith and belief in miracles is not all that different from magic in some ways.”
This sentiment was echoed by Chris Schoebinger, publishing director of Shadow Mountain, an imprint of Deseret Book (the publishing arm of the church).
“One of the core doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is what’s called the plan of salvation,” Schoebinger said. “Which takes us from, first, living with our father in heaven, and then coming to Earth, going through this battle for good and evil, this atonement where we’re changed, and then returning to God, or wherever we started, a changed person. That is the hero’s journey.”
Schoebinger is known for discovering fantasy author Brandon Mull, who offered another reason writers in the church are drawn to middle-grade and YA fiction. “Big families,” he said by phone from his home in Highland, north of Provo. “We grow up with that kind of stuff. Disney’s huge in this community. All things family entertainment is pretty big.”
Every author said that a key reason Latter-day Saints tend to write for teenagers and children is a church-encouraged distaste for explicit material that can be found in adult fiction. They prefer to write books that are “clean” — the church’s term for content without graphic sex or violence. It’s one reason Mull sticks to middle-grade, he said: “I’m like a little kid that way. I like an old-timey classic adventure story.”
The preference for clean fiction is shared by adult readers in the church community, said Gene Nelson, a longtime director of the Provo City Library. “There’s a lot of people who are tired of the detailed sexuality and violence that occurs in a lot of adult fiction,” he said. “They don’t want to see the F-word bandied about. When the book almost becomes erotica at some point, where do they go? They go to YA fiction.”
The church has no official guidelines for what constitutes clean fiction, but the cover of the Provo City Library’s “So Fresh! So Clean!” booklet — a list of its approved books — warns, in part: “Books on this list may have some occurrences of the tamest expletives. Sexual references might occur but nothing explicit.”
The histories of Mormon publishing, church-backed children’s education and Utah statehood are intertwined in the biography of one early settler.
George Q. Cannon, a writer from England, was among the first Mormons to arrive in the Salt Lake Valley, in 1847. He became the church’s chief storyteller in the West. He edited, and at one point owned, The Deseret News in Salt Lake City. He started a weekly church newspaper in San Francisco.
He was also the first general superintendent of the church’s Sunday schools. Cannon editorialized against “trashy” literature, which he said was one of the greatest threats to the religious education of young people. (Brigham Young said novels were “falsehoods got up expressly to excite the minds of youth.”) To spread “uplifting” stories, Cannon created the church’s first magazine for children, Juvenile Instructor, and later founded the bookstore and press that became Deseret Book.
Mormons started writing fiction in greater numbers in the 1880s in what’s known as the “home-literature movement,” spurred when church leaders, still vexed by the growing popularity of novels, urged adherents to write their own. “We will yet have Miltons and Shakespeares of our own,” apostle Orson F. Whitney declared.
Today Deseret Book comprises three imprints, 40 bookstores, a record company and a film distribution company called Excel Entertainment. Its corporate offices are in a complex of glass buildings not far from Temple Square in Salt Lake City.
Deseret’s main imprint publishes Scripture, church curriculum, inspirational guides for missionaries, self-help, biographies and histories. Shadow Mountain, the general trade imprint, has a different mission: to publish “values based” fiction and nonfiction that may appeal to readers who don’t share the same faith.
The imprint was established in 1985, Schoebinger said, but a turning point came in the early 2000s, when a survey revealed that customers were reading “Harry Potter” books in droves. Editors combed the slush pile for fantasy manuscripts. Shadow Mountain soon had a bestseller with “Fablehaven,” Mull’s first book, about an enchanted refuge for magical creatures.
When “Fifty Shades of Grey” came out (itself inspired in part by “Twilight”), Schoebinger and his colleagues wondered if they could find a market for G-rated romance, an opportunity other publishers had also tapped. “We wanted a book that mothers and daughters could read together and just feel good about,” he said. The result was Proper Romance, Shadow Mountain’s line of clean romance novels.
Shadow Mountain has had more than 10 books on one of The New York Times’ bestseller lists. Many are by Mull. Another is “The Romney Family Table,” a cookbook by Ann Romney.
The Church and Gay Rights
Since the “Twilight”-fueled boom of the 2000s, it has become more common for contemporary YA to contain sex and violence. At the King’s English, a popular independent bookstore in Salt Lake City, steamy novels like “A Court of Thorns and Roses,” by Sarah J. Maas, about a teenage huntress who falls in love with her faerie captor, sell fast. And novels like “Felix Ever After” by Kacen Callender, about a Black trans teenager, and “Camp” by L.C. Rosen, about a summer camp for queer teenagers, are also sought after.
Latter-day Saints doctrine officially declares same-sex relationships sinful. “The church distinguishes between same-sex attraction and homosexual behavior,” its policy states. “People who experience same-sex attraction or identify as gay, lesbian or bisexual can make and keep covenants with God and fully and worthily participate in the church.” People who act on same-sex attraction, however, cannot. “Sexual relations are reserved for a man and woman who are married and promise complete loyalty to each other.”
There appears to be evidence of a correlation between the church’s treatment of LGBTQ members and research showing that more younger Latter-day Saints are leaving the church.
According to polling by Jana Riess, author of “The Next Mormons: How Millennials Are Changing the LDS Church,” the church’s position on LGBTQ issues ranks seventh out of 30 reasons that former Mormons cite for leaving the church. Among millennials who have left, it’s third.
In fact, six of the authors contacted for this article responded that they were no longer active in the church.
One, Matt Kirby, said his allegiance started to crack when his brother came out as gay in the late ’90s. “There was no question that my family and I would continue to love him no matter what,” Kirby said. “My concern was: In this context, in this religious context, what will it mean for him?” The breaking point for Kirby was the church’s push to pass Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in California. (It was later struck down.)
Kiersten White, who has written more than 20 books for young adults and children, including “The Dark Descent of Elizabeth Frankenstein,” also cited the church’s support for Proposition 8.
“One of the things that Mormonism teaches you is that everyone is entitled to personal revelation, that you have a direct line to God,” White said. “He’ll either give you a burning in your bosom if things are correct or a stupor of thought if things are incorrect. I still remember being at my polling place, looking down at my ballot, and knowing that our church had not only campaigned for Prop 8 and donated significant amounts of money, but specifically over the pulpit asked us to vote for it. And I felt sick.”
Mette Ivie Harrison said the church’s opposition to gay rights was one of many factors. “The Bishop’s Wife,” her adult mystery published in 2014, involved domestic abuse, and its protagonist, Linda, a devout Mormon, experiences doubts about some church beliefs. Deseret Book did not carry it in its stores.
The book was received positively outside church channels, including a review by Janet Maslin in the Times, and HuffPost asked Harrison to write a column about Mormonism. Her essays drew the attention of a group called the Strengthening Church Members Committee, she said, and her local bishop called her in to discuss them.
The conversation was friendly, she said, and she was not threatened with discipline. But she found it unsettling that her writing had been flagged. A spokesperson for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints declined to comment for this article.
In 2015, the church passed its so-called November Policy, which declared members in same-sex marriages apostates and barred their children from being baptized. At that time, Harrison had close family friends in the church community who had a child who had come out as transgender. To signal that she was in mourning over the church’s treatment of LGBTQ members, Harrison started wearing black clothes and a rainbow ribbon to services.
Although the November Policy was later reversed, Harrison stopped attending church in 2019.
A ‘Forced Innocence’
It’s unclear how often fiction writers are pressured by the church to change their work. When it happens, it happens in private.
But Brian Evenson did have a public confrontation with BYU in the 1990s. He was teaching creative writing when his first book, “Altmann’s Tongue,” a collection of horror stories, came out. A student objected to the violence in the stories on moral grounds. “I feel like someone who has eaten something poisonous,” the student wrote in an anonymous letter to church leaders. This prompted a review of the book.
He was informed that he could not publish another book like “Altmann’s Tongue” and keep his job at BYU. He resigned. “The pressure was, if I want to keep on writing and not have to constantly be thinking about these people who want me to be writing in a different way, I’ve got to leave,” Evenson said by phone from his home in Santa Clarita, California.
He soon started writing a novel that was more directly about Mormonism than any of his past work had been. “One thing that happens when you grow up Mormon is that you have this system of self-censorship that’s built in,” Evenson said.
The novel, “Father of Lies,” which came out in 1998, has been described as a “patriarchal horror.” Evenson ultimately resigned from the church in 2000.
White, the prolific teen horror and paranormal romance author, said she was never pressured by the church, but her writing did change after she left. Previously, she wrote fiction for young adults and children. She has since written two novels for adults.
“There’s this sort of forced innocence,” White said of being a devout Mormon. “Even though you’re an adult and you have children, you have to engage with and move through the world in a PG way, as though you are still a child.”
Her second novel for adults, “Mister Magic,” was published in August. It’s about a religious sect in the desert in Utah.

Full text: Small armies of landscapers tend to lush grass and rolling hills, where private roads with names like "Memory Lane" and "Baby Land" lead upward past maximalist mausoleums, columbaria and replica Renaissance statuary.
At the top is the quaintly named Mount Forest Lawn, a hill housing a theater named the Hall of Crucifixion-Resurrection, built for just a single work: the Polish artist Jan Styka's 195-feet-by-45-feet "The Crucifixion," one of the largest religious paintings in the world. A turn-of-the-20th-century marvel, the artwork is part of the short-lived genre of panorama painting -- canvases hung in near-360 degrees that provided viewers an affordable immersive journey, often to vistas of Christendom or crowded battle sequences.
The theater and adjoining art museum are part of Forest Lawn Memorial-Park, a 300-acre cemetery that has been a Los Angeles landmark since it was founded by Hubert Eaton in 1917. A medley of architecture, art and artifacts, the burial grounds are the forever homes of Michael Jackson, Carole Lombard, Jimmy Stewart, Walt Disney and countless other stars, with flat grave markers to ensure that the emerald green hills and views of downtown Los Angeles remain unobstructed.
The painting lives behind some of the largest curtains in the world -- twice as wide as an IMAX screen -- and is viewable from 700 red velvet seats. To reach it, visitors must traverse an architectural mishmash, entering through a crudely imitated Italian cathedral facade, then passing through a French Gothic stained glass corridor before stepping into a grand movie hall. There, Styka's Jesus, nearing his last moments on Golgotha, gazes toward a heavenly Klieg light, surrounded by Mary, the apostles and a thousand extras.
This September, visitors will see a new program for the painting, its first major overhaul since the Hall of Crucifixion opened on Good Friday in 1951. The painting has always been presented with a dramatic sound-and-light show, simulating thunder and lightning, with fire-and-brimstone-tinged narration while double-timing as an advertisement for the cemetery's mortuary services. (Feeling the Passion of the Christ was only half-told, Eaton commissioned the Southern California artist Robert Clark to produce a sequel: "The Resurrection." This smaller work was added to the Hall in 1965.)
James Fishburne, Forest Lawn's museum director and resident art historian, has re-envisioned the audiovisual program of "The Crucifixion," untangling the secular from the sacred and chronicling the painting's roundabout journey from Eastern Europe to the United States, where, according to Forest Lawn lore, it was found by Eaton in the basement of the Chicago Opera House wrapped around a telephone pole. If the previous iteration of the program resembled a late-night religious infotainment soundscape, the new version is midday History Channel. Out are the voice of God, lightning and jump-scare musical cues.
"Forest Lawn Museum is an unorthodox arts institution, but yes, absolutely, it is part of a functioning cemetery," said Fishburne, who pointed out that historically the painting's primary audience has been the few bereaved visitors who come to the theater to decompress.
"We've made a genuine effort to broaden the appeal of the experience," Fishburne explained. "Frankly, I want everyone to visit it. I want everyone from Southern California, I want everyone from the country, and the whole world to visit and I know that's an ambitious goal."
A chipper curator, Fishburne is a Navy veteran and former Getty Research Institute scholar, specializing in Renaissance-era papal coinage, somehow right at home among the undertakers and burial advisers at the cemetery. His hiring in 2018 signaled a radical departure for Forest Lawn Museum, a 5,400-square-feet space of art galleries and the adjacent theater, both of which have remained largely unchanged for 72 years.
Alison Bruesehoff, a former Forest Lawn Museum director, said when she took over in 2001, an exhibition on Michelangelo looked like it had been there for decades.
"They had to make a decision," she said. "Do we do something with this museum or do we not?"
Forest Lawn decided to do something. "I do want to give credit to my predecessors, some of whom I know and some of whom I don't, but I think it was a gradual realization of the historic importance of this site," Fishburne said.
Now he has a star-turning role, appearing in the museum's audiovisual accompaniment of "The Crucifixion." A new 12-foot digital video screen has been added, complete with slick, globe-trotting animations, "definitely inspired by Indiana Jones," Fishburne acknowledged. He appears occasionally throughout the video as a guide, teaming with a professional narrator to tell the history of the painting, Forest Lawn's surreal architecture, and the biblical details in Styka's composition. Much attention has been given to new LED spotlights, which pinpoint characters and scenes in the painting.
Fishburne's makeover brings a decidedly more academic, technical and art-history-minded cadence to the theatrical show, a far cry from its previous program. The goal was to create a show that balanced its past billing as a religious, almost roadside attraction, and its future as a work of art.
"It was very, very religious," said Bruesehoff, who was pivotal in the program's last update in 2006.
"People have never heard of it," Asha Schechter, an artist who teaches art at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, N.Y., and the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif., said of Styka's painting. "It's the idea of building an entire structure to house one work in this extremely theatrical way. It demonstrates art can be made that won't just live in a white box for five weeks but can exist over an indefinite period of time." For years, Schechter has taken groups of students to visit the painting, noting that they can be overwhelmed -- not just by its scale, but by the confrontation with mortality and visual aesthetics of eternal memorialization.
Sara Velas is the director of the Velaslavasay Panorama, one of the few remaining panorama painting venues in the country. Coordinating with the launch of the new program, Fishburne enlisted the help of Velas and her organization to curate an exhibition on the history of such panoramic paintings, also at the Forest Lawn Museum.
"An argument could be made that panorama paintings are not pre-cinema, but that they are cinema themselves," Velas said. "The way that peripheral vision is activated inherently makes things more experiential and opens up a different type of memory, really."
For Velas, also a painter, the installation of Styka's painting in a movie theater with overt theatrical framing makes perfect sense.
"The curtain opens and closes and it's the same psychological preparation," she said.
Could the revamp of Styka's painting signal a new lease on life for the cemetery's museum program?
"If somebody said, 'Would you rather have a show at Forest Lawn Museum or would you rather have it at MOCA?' I would pick Forest Lawn Museum in a second."

Full text: After running for 60 miles through snow, up steep, root-filled switchbacks with thousands of feet of elevation gain, Courtney Dauwalter entered what she calls her pain cave. For the next 40 miles of the Western States 100-Mile Endurance Run through California's Sierra Nevada, she imagined she was holding a chisel and chipping away at the furthest reaches of her pain, while staying focused on every step she took. By the time Dauwalter crossed the finish line in 15 hours, 29 minutes and 33 seconds, she had obliterated the women's course record by more than an hour and had run the 23rd-fastest time, by anyone, in the race's 45-year history.
To put Dauwalter's time in perspective, it would have won the men's division of Western States -- arguably the most competitive 100-mile race in the world -- every year from 1978 through 2009. Scott Jurek won Western States seven times (most recently in 2005) but never once ran as fast as Dauwalter did this year. She beat a 1994 Western States record set by Ann Trason, who won the race 14 times, by more than two hours.
Dauwalter is one of the most colorful characters in ultrarunning. She is known for her love of candy, nachos and beer, as well as her loose shorts and her vivid on-course hallucinations, which are illustrated on hats and T-shirts. In the past 10 years, she has won more than 50 races of 30 miles or longer. In 2017, she won a 240-mile race in Moab, Utah, by 10 hours. In winning Big Dog's Backyard Ultra in 2020, she ran 283 miles and hallucinated that Mickey Mouse was standing on a circus stage handing out T-shirts to a crowd.
Now she is trying to do something even the most accomplished ultrarunners would consider extraordinary: win three highly competitive 100-mile races in a single summer. Twenty days after her performance at Western States, she won the grueling Hardrock 100 in Silverton, Colo., breaking her own record by 20 minutes and placing fourth overall. This weekend, seven weeks after winning Hardrock, she will toe the line at the Ultra Trail du Mont-Blanc, a brutally steep, 106-mile race in Chamonix, France, with terrain more suited to billy goats than humans. She has won the race twice and currently holds the women's record.
"In general, I am pretty tired," said Dauwalter, whose mottos when things get tough in a race are "This is fine" and "Be brave and believe." She said running all three races was not the plan at first, but that she just had to try it.
"I am so curious what will happen and excited to test myself," she said.
Lanky and blond, with a deep tan, expressive blue eyes and permanent laugh lines, Dauwalter, 38, believes one of the greatest evolutions in her running career has been her embrace of the "pain cave." Initially, she thought of it as the place where she could no longer bear the suffering and would have to stop running. Indeed, she quit the first 100-mile race she attempted in 2012 because she was overwhelmed by pain. But as she ran more races, she started to understand that she could work through it. She said she envisioned herself in a hard hat, wielding a chisel and "going to town, trying to make it a dust pile while I am in there."
She continued: "It feels like this is a special opportunity every time it arrives because we can't summon it whenever we want. We have to be doing something hard, push ourselves, and then maybe we will get the chance to go in. And if we do, we should celebrate that we get to be there."
Sitting on a deck that overlooks the Rockies at her home in Leadville, Colo., on a sunny, mid-August afternoon, Dauwalter sipped a fruity seltzer and pointed to two 14,000-foot mountains that she often runs to from her house. In a sport where most elite runners have a coach and map out their training schedules weeks in advance, Dauwalter trains herself and does not know how many miles she will run on any given day. Her mornings usually begin around 4 a.m. with a cup of coffee with vanilla crunch creamer. She responds to emails, then does about 40 minutes of strength training. By 7 a.m., she hits the trail and runs for an hour to five hours. She often adds a bike ride and a second run with her husband, Kevin Schmidt.
"I try and go into every week really open to whatever happens so that I will actually tune into my body and listen to it," said Dauwalter, who wears a running watch but does not post her workouts on popular running apps like Strava, as many ultrarunners do. "If I go into a week thinking it is going to be a really big mileage week or I have all these grand ideas about it, then I find it harder to listen to my body and actually respond to what it is telling me." Her big mileage weeks are often 140 miles.
Schmidt, a software engineer who said he didn't know about ultramarathons until he met Dauwalter over a decade ago, tracks the possible mile splits she could have and meticulously plans the support stations along the course. Though Schmidt sets time goals, the couple does not focus on them or get too confident about a race until Dauwalter is at the finish line. In 2019, she was leading Western States, but had to drop out at mile 80 because of a leg injury. In 2021, her stomach issues were so severe at Hardrock that she couldn't go on. Even when all goes as planned, random events can intervene, like when Dauwalter had to go off course to avoid a moose or lost her vision when her corneas swelled from the dust on the trail.
The pair said that nutrition is now a big part of their plan. A friend who works as a dietitian said Dauwalter had stomach problems in races because she was not getting enough calories. Dauwalter now picks up a plastic bag at each support station filled with an assortment of gels and energy waffles and carries water and a sports drink. Her job is to hand back a bag with empty wrappers.
Schmidt believes Dauwalter's supportive family and her athletic background in her home state of Minnesota helped her learn to be aware of what she was feeling. She ran cross-country in high school and was a state champion Nordic skier, which earned her a skiing scholarship to the University of Denver.
"She had fantastic parents who raised her really well, encouraged her to be competitive and didn't put restrictions on her, so she never felt like she couldn't compete against her brothers," Schmidt said. "And she had really great coaches who taught her how to be in tune with her body, which I think has helped her have this very unstructured training format that works for her."
Meghan Hicks, the editor in chief of iRunFar, an ultrarunning website, said many runners unintentionally set limitations on themselves by focusing on a course record and the splits it will take to beat it.
"Courtney does not work that way," she said. "She goes and runs by the way she is feeling."
Hicks said Dauwalter has "a wide-open approach that you don't see a lot of runners doing and I think that is perhaps part of her key to success."
Dauwalter's performances have led some to wonder whether women will become faster than men as distances get longer. Dr. Sandra Hunter, the director for the Athletic and Human Performance Research Center at Marquette University, said they will not. Men's physiological and anatomical advantages, including less body fat, greater hemoglobin and higher oxygen uptake, mean that they will always be faster overall, she said.
For example, Jim Walmsley, who holds the men's record for Western States with a time that is about 9 percent faster than Dauwalter's. According to an article in Sports Medicine, in major ultra trail races where the best men and women are present, this number rarely dips below 8 percent. That was the difference between Dauwalter's time and the fastest men's time at Ultra Trail du Mont-Blanc in 2021. The gap between the best male and female performances for running events from sprints to marathons usually hovers around 10 to 12 percent.
"There is a fundamental sex difference between males and females that won't go away," Hunter said. But Hicks said women have reached a place in ultrarunning where they need not be compared to men because their performances are valid without that comparison -- a view widely held by women in the sport.
Hunter said Dauwalter's running economy, which is measured by the oxygen consumption of a runner at a set speed and often improves as runners get older, may be superior to most other participants in the sport. While there has been a boom of women ultramarathoners, there are still far fewer women than men in ultra running, and they usually run shorter distances like the 50K. Hunter said that Dauwalter's stellar performance shows that there is still a great deal of room for women to evolve.
Dauwalter, who is known for being generous with her time and cheering on the people around her, continues to elevate others in the sport, especially women, Hicks said. In 2020, when Hicks set the fastest known supported women's time in a roughly 90-mile challenge called Nolan's 14, which involves hiking and running 14 14,000-foot mountains, Dauwalter paced her through the night, telling jokes and stories to make the time pass. Around midnight, she asked Hicks if she wanted a bite of pizza and pulled out a slice wrapped in tinfoil from her pack.
"Who does that?" Hicks asked. "Maybe your husband or your best friend? But who in the top of the sport is doing that?"
Dauwalter's approach to the business of running reflects her desire to lift others in the sport. She used her sponsorship with Salomon to influence a new line of women's running shorts that are longer and looser than most shorts on the market. Dauwalter hopes that the shorts will give women another option to be comfortable and that maybe "the length is the thing that makes someone get out on the trail and try."
She also wants to inject some humor into what can be an intense pursuit. Recently, Tailwind Nutrition debuted a "Make New Friends" line of T-shirts and hats featuring images that Dauwalter has seen in hallucinations on the trail: a giant cowboy, puppets on a swing set, a giraffe.
John Medinger, the former publisher of UltraRunning Magazine, has been at every Western States since 1983 and has collected statistics on the race for over four decades. Dauwalter's performance can't be quantified, he said. No runner has posted times like hers in such a wide range of races -- fast ones, steep ones, extraordinarily long ones and races of attrition in which the last person standing wins.
"There are courses for horses and horses for courses, but I'm not sure there's a course that isn't a good one for Courtney," he said.

A Cloud Over an Ice Cream Brand Built on Rainbows

It was all rainbows and unicorns for a while. But like many fun ideas, Big Gay Ice Cream has wound up in debt and in court.
With a rollicking rise that leveraged queer identity as a brand strategy, the New York City-based soft-serve chain opened seven shops in the Northeast and landed its products in supermarkets nationwide. The company now is down to just one location.
On Friday, a founder and partner, Doug Quint, filed a lawsuit in New York State Supreme Court accusing another partner, Jon Chapski, of mismanaging the company and fraudulently collecting government loans during the pandemic.
On Tuesday afternoon, through a spokesperson, Chapski said only that he was reviewing the lawsuit with his lawyer and would respond “when appropriate.”
In 2009, when the Big Gay Ice Cream Truck first rolled into the annual Brooklyn Pride parade, it caught a wave of pop culture that included hits like “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” Lady Gaga’s “Born This Way” and “Orange Is the New Black,” and marked a national shift that culminated in the legalization of marriage for same-sex couples across the country in 2015.
The company’s first shops exploded in Greenwich Village in a burst of rainbow sprinkles. Locals and tourists alike thrilled to the cheeky branding (Barbie dolls, glitter, “Golden Girls” references) and made pilgrimages for Bea Arthur swirls and Monday Sundaes.
Quint and Bryan Petroff, the avuncular (and gay) founders, went on to draw a mainstream following that helped make “don’t ask, don’t tell” a thing of the past (in food marketing, at least). In 2017, Nestlé began distributing the company’s hard-pack ice cream in supermarkets nationwide; People magazine covered the introduction of three new flavors in 2019.
“I thought Big Gay was my life’s work, the thing I was meant to do,” said Quint, who gave up his decadeslong career as a classical musician in 2011, when the business had two profitable stores and he had secured a six-figure deal to write the cookbook “Big Gay Ice Cream: Saucy Stories and Frozen Treats.”
During the pandemic, though, the good vibes evaporated. Today, after multiple missteps, unpaid debts and evictions, the company’s future is murky. Quint is working in a Walgreens pharmacy in Pittsfield, Maine, where he grew up. Petroff works in human resources for a New York restaurant chain.
Both men say they hope to pull the company back from the brink and continue without Chapski, whom they hired as a financial adviser in 2011 and made a partner in 2016. The founders continued to develop new products and marketing efforts, but Chapski effectively ran the business.
Quint is seeking at least $4 million, claiming damages arising from breach of contract, fiduciary irresponsibility and “willful misconduct” by Chapski. (Petroff, who like Quint still retains a 35% ownership stake, has declined to be a party to the suit, citing the expense of legal representation, but said Quint had his “full support.”)
In his lawsuit, Quint accuses Chapski of failing to pay landlords, vendors and the IRS; concealing legal proceedings and business moves from him and Petroff; and collecting government loans during the pandemic while the stores remained closed and employees went unpaid. Public records show that the four New York City stores — each of which is a separate limited-liability corporation — received loans totaling more than $500,000.
Quint said in an interview that Chapski has maintained his lifestyle even as the company has descended into debt. Chapski and his wife, Agnes, a former publisher of In Style and Allure magazines, own a 2,000-square-foot loft in TriBeCa and a beach house in Montauk, New York. (The beach property went into foreclosure on Aug. 14, according to documents filed in Suffolk County Supreme Court.)
The one remaining ice cream store, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, is operated by Jeremy Wladis, a longtime neighborhood restaurateur. On Friday, Wladis said he had been granted permission to use the Big Gay brand and recipes by Chapski, who repeatedly assured him that the founders were no longer involved.
Wladis told the Times that he felt uneasy about the arrangement and tried many times to contact them directly, but never got a reply. Quint and Petroff say that was because Chapski had secretly blocked their access to company email and social-media feeds.
The company began as a summer-job lark when Quint and Petroff outfitted an old van, created a menu of bedazzled soft-serve treats and sailed it to Prospect Park as the Big Gay Ice Cream Truck.
Zac Young, now a Food Network star and then the pastry chef at Butter in NoLIta, said he felt equal parts shock, fear and pride when the truck rolled out: “I thought, you can’t do that, you can’t say that!”
Restaurant kitchens were rife with homophobic abuse, he said, and even the traditional “pink ghetto” of pastry operations was usually run by straight white men (though women and gay men often carried out the pastry chef’s vision).
The company’s rapid rise “proved to me that you could be queer and open in the food space, and still be safe and loved,” Young said.
Not everyone was a fan. Some LGBTQ+ people balked at the upbeat marketing of a community still enduring hate. Bill Yosses, the pastry chef at Blue Hill at Stone Barns, said, “It trivializes the real struggles that gay people have endured.”
Christina Tosi, the pastry chef and founder of the Milk Bar dessert shops, had just started working at the New York restaurant Momofuku when Big Gay first rolled out. “They had a commitment to flavor and creativity and humor that carved out space for us all,” she said.
She went on to build an empire on innovative tastes like cereal milk-flavored soft-serve. “People’s willingness to cannonball and take a chance comes from them,” she said.
The Big Gay Ice Cream stores in the East Village and West Village flourished. The truck toured the South, drawing crowds in Atlanta and Charleston, South Carolina. A Philadelphia shop followed, along with local high-profile New York locations like the South Street Seaport and Madison Square Garden.
As the business expanded, the two founders relied on Chapski’s consulting company, Edible Assets, for bookkeeping and financial management.
In the 2016 partnership agreement, Quint and Petroff each retained a 35% share in the company, with the remaining 30% held by Edible Assets. That same year, they signed an amendment that gave Chapski “final authority and unilateral decision-making power over all financial matters,” while granting the same power to Quint and Petroff for the “creative direction” of the company.
“We were so naive,” Quint said ruefully, acknowledging that he and Petroff willingly entrusted Chapski with both their corporate finances and personal livelihoods.
But once Chapski was made a partner in Big Gay, according to the founders and three former employees, he pushed for growth that the company’s income and infrastructure could not sustain.
“He was always talking about being the next Starbucks,” said Gary Hernandez, a longtime manager who resigned in 2019.
Big Gay’s trajectory is not unusual in the food world. After a rapid rise in popularity and collaborations with The Walt Disney Co. and Marvel, the Brooklyn ice cream darling Ample Hills was bought by a venture capital firm and forced into bankruptcy.
Hernandez said that Quint and Petroff were not involved in Big Gay’s day-to-day operations or financial matters, and that after the company began expanding, chaos, conflict and angry calls from vendors and landlords became common. “That’s when stuff started going haywire,” he said.
Even so, by 2017, the brand was strong enough to earn a coveted place in supermarket freezers, with pints sold nationally at stores such as Safeway, Wawa and CVS.
Quint was walking his dog when his sister first sent a photograph of the pints at the market in his rural hometown. He packed the car and drove straight to Maine. “I had to see it with my own eyes,” he said. Then, he said, he went to the dumpster out back and cried for the miserable gay teenager who had fled to New York to study music in 1989.
“I ran from this place when I was 17,” he said. “I could never have imagined ending up back here.”
But in 2020, with the stores closed indefinitely under lockdown, Quint says he was forced to move out of New York, taking a minimum-wage job at a CVS. In 2021, the flagship store in the East Village closed; soon after, the company was evicted from its shops in the West Village and Philadelphia. (For the West Village store alone, the back rent owed was nearly $400,000, according to court documents.)
Without his knowledge, he said, federal loan money was flowing in while judgments and summonses were piling up on the doorstep of his unoccupied apartment. “What we didn’t realize is that creative control is meaningless, if the money is all up to someone else.”

Full text: A company that rode to success with an inclusive message has shrunk to a single store, as a founder sues a partner he accuses of mismanagement and fraud.
It was all rainbows and unicorns for a while. But like many fun ideas, Big Gay Ice Cream has wound up in debt and in court.
With a rollicking rise that leveraged queer identity as a brand strategy, the New York City-based soft-serve chain opened seven shops in the Northeast and landed its products in supermarkets nationwide. The company now is down to just one location. On Friday, a founder and partner, Doug Quint, filed a lawsuit in New York State Supreme Court accusing another partner, Jon Chapski, of mismanaging the company and fraudulently collecting government loans during the pandemic.
On Tuesday afternoon, through a spokesperson, Mr. Chapski said only that he was reviewing the lawsuit with his lawyer and would respond "when appropriate."
In 2009, when the Big Gay Ice Cream Truck first rolled into the annual Brooklyn Pride parade, it caught a wave of pop culture that included hits like "RuPaul's Drag Race," Lady Gaga's "Born This Way" and "Orange Is the New Black," and marked a national shift that culminated in the legalization of marriage for same-sex couples across the country in 2015.
The company's first shops exploded in Greenwich Village in a burst of rainbow sprinkles. Locals and tourists alike thrilled to the cheeky branding (Barbie dolls, glitter, "Golden Girls" references) and made pilgrimages for Bea Arthur swirls and Monday Sundaes.
Mr. Quint and Bryan Petroff, the avuncular (and gay) founders, went on to draw a mainstream following that helped make "don't ask, don't tell" a thing of the past (in food marketing, at least). In 2017, Nestlé began distributing the company's hard-pack ice cream in supermarkets nationwide; People magazine covered the introduction of three new flavors in 2019.
"I thought Big Gay was my life's work, the thing I was meant to do," said Mr. Quint, who gave up his decades-long career as a classical musician in 2011, when the business had two profitable stores and he had secured a six-figure deal to write the cookbook "Big Gay Ice Cream: Saucy Stories and Frozen Treats."
During the pandemic, though, the good vibes evaporated. Today, after multiple missteps, unpaid debts and evictions, the company's future is murky. Mr. Quint is working in a Walgreens pharmacy in Pittsfield, Maine, where he grew up. Mr. Petroff works in human resources for a New York restaurant chain.
Both men say they hope to pull the company back from the brink and continue without Mr. Chapski, whom they hired as a financial adviser in 2011 and made a partner in 2016. The founders continued to develop new products and marketing efforts, but Mr. Chapski effectively ran the business.
Mr. Quint is seeking at least $ 4 million, claiming damages arising from breach of contract, fiduciary irresponsibility and "willful misconduct" by Mr. Chapski. (Mr. Petroff, who like Mr. Quint still retains a 35 percent ownership stake, has declined to be a party to the suit, citing the expense of legal representation, but said Mr. Quint had his "full support.")
In his lawsuit, Mr. Quint accuses Mr. Chapski of failing to pay landlords, vendors and the I.R.S.; concealing legal proceedings and business moves from him and Mr. Petroff; and collecting government loans during the pandemic while the stores remained closed and employees went unpaid. Public records show that the four New York City stores -- each of which is a separate limited-liability corporation -- received loans totaling more than $ 500,000.
Mr. Quint said in an interview that Mr. Chapski has maintained his lifestyle even as the company has descended into debt. Mr. Chapski and his wife, Agnes, a former publisher of In Style and Allure magazines, own a 2,000-square-foot loft in TriBeCa and a beach house in Montauk, N.Y. (The beach property went into foreclosure on Aug. 14, according to documents filed in Suffolk County Supreme Court.)
The one remaining ice cream store, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, is operated by Jeremy Wladis, a longtime neighborhood restaurateur. On Friday, Mr. Wladis said he had been granted permission to use the Big Gay brand and recipes by Mr. Chapski, who repeatedly assured him that the founders were no longer involved.
Mr. Wladis told The Times that he felt uneasy about the arrangement and tried many times to contact them directly, but never got a reply. Mr. Quint and Mr. Petroff say that was because Mr. Chapski had secretly blocked their access to company email and social-media feeds.
The company began as a summer-job lark when Mr. Quint and Mr. Petroff outfitted an old van, created a menu of bedazzled soft-serve treats and sailed it to Prospect Park as the Big Gay Ice Cream Truck.
Zac Young, now a Food Network star and then the pastry chef at Butter in NoLIta, said he felt equal parts shock, fear and pride when the truck rolled out: "I thought, you can't do that, you can't say that!"
Restaurant kitchens were rife with homophobic abuse, he said, and even the traditional "pink ghetto" of pastry operations was usually run by straight white men (though women and gay men often carried out the pastry chef's vision).
The company's rapid rise "proved to me that you could be queer and open in the food space, and still be safe and loved," Mr. Young said.
Not everyone was a fan. Some L.G.B.T.Q. people balked at the upbeat marketing of a community still enduring hate. Bill Yosses, the pastry chef at Blue Hill at Stone Barns, said, "It trivializes the real struggles that gay people have endured."
Christina Tosi, the pastry chef and founder of the Milk Bar dessert shops, had just started working at the New York restaurant Momofuku when Big Gay first rolled out. "They had a commitment to flavor and creativity and humor that carved out space for us all," she said.
She went on to build an empire on innovative tastes like cereal milk-flavored soft-serve. "People's willingness to cannonball and take a chance comes from them," she said.
The Big Gay Ice Cream stores in the East Village and West Village flourished. The truck toured the South, drawing crowds in Atlanta and Charleston, S.C. A Philadelphia shop followed, along with local high-profile New York locations like the South Street Seaport and Madison Square Garden.
As the business expanded, the two founders relied on Mr. Chapski's consulting company, Edible Assets, for bookkeeping and financial management.
In the 2016 partnership agreement, Mr. Quint and Mr. Petroff each retained a 35 percent share in the company, with the remaining 30 percent held by Edible Assets. That same year, they signed an amendment that gave Mr. Chapski "final authority and unilateral decision-making power over all financial matters," while granting the same power to Mr. Quint and Mr. Petroff for the "creative direction" of the company.
"We were so naïve," Mr. Quint said ruefully, acknowledging that he and Mr. Petroff willingly entrusted Mr. Chapski with both their corporate finances and personal livelihoods.
But once Mr. Chapski was made a partner in Big Gay, according to the founders and three former employees, he pushed for growth that the company's income and infrastructure could not sustain.
"He was always talking about being the next Starbucks," said Gary Hernandez, a longtime manager who resigned in 2019.
Big Gay's trajectory is not unusual in the food world. After a rapid rise in popularity and collaborations with Disney and Marvel, the Brooklyn ice cream darling Ample Hills was bought by a venture capital firm and forced into bankruptcy.
Mr. Hernandez said that Mr. Quint and Mr. Petroff were not involved in Big Gay's day-to-day operations or financial matters, and that after the company began expanding, chaos, conflict and angry calls from vendors and landlords became common. "That's when stuff started going haywire," he said.
Even so, by 2017, the brand was strong enough to earn a coveted place in supermarket freezers, with pints sold nationally at stores like Safeway, Wawa and CVS.
Mr. Quint was walking his dog when his sister first sent a photograph of the pints at the market in his rural hometown. He packed the car and drove straight to Maine. "I had to see it with my own eyes," he said. Then, he said, he went to the dumpster out back and cried for the miserable gay teenager who had fled to New York to study music in 1989.

A Toddler's Long, Slow Road To Recovery After a Shooting: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It was story time. A pair of 2-year-olds sat on miniature chairs pulled up to a miniature table at Blythedale Children's Hospital in Valhalla, N.Y., listening attentively.
"We have so many animals that have boo-boos in our book," a brown-haired woman said in a singsong voice, holding up a book called "All Better!"
"Feel better, doggy," one of the toddlers, a girl with seven braids, said as she placed a red Band-Aid sticker on the paw of a dog in the book.
The girl, Catherine Arias, was herself recovering from a very real and much more grievous injury. In January 2022, days away from her first birthday, she was caught in the crossfire of a shooting outside a pharmacy in the Bronx. The bullet penetrated the left side of her brain, leaving her with a traumatic injury and weakness on the right side of her body. More than a year and a half later, she still requires five days of therapy every week to improve her ability to eat, talk and move.
Earlier this month, federal prosecutors announced the arrest of two men in connection with Catherine's shooting, a relief to her parents, who have struggled for months to come to terms with the calamity.
"I just started crying -- I couldn't talk after that," Gregory Arias, Catherine's father, said.
"It was like a dry-heave cry," Miraida Gomez, her mother, said. "The cry that I didn't get to have processing everything that we've been through was the cry that I had that morning."
The shooting and its aftermath -- expensive medical treatment for Catherine, worry over the emotional health of her two older sisters, court appearances for the accused men -- have left the family with complicated and conflicting emotions.
Ms. Gomez and Mr. Arias, high school sweethearts, have deep ties to the Bronx, where they were born and raised. They were keenly aware of the violence that can plague their neighborhood.
Catherine was one of 56 children shot in the Bronx last year, the highest tally of any part of the city, according to New York Police Department data. Her injury and her long road to recovery are a grim reminder of the life-altering consequences of gun violence across the city, even when shootings are not fatal.
Yet Ms. Gomez, a social worker, found herself struggling with something approaching sympathy for the men arrested, wondering what was missing in their childhoods that had led them to the streets.
Still, Catherine's parents are eager to provide a far better life for their own children and are now saving money to move out of the Bronx -- out of the city altogether.
'I'm seeing death'
On Jan. 19, 2022, Ms. Gomez had finished work and was excitedly planning Catherine's first birthday party at her mother's house. She had decided on the theme -- pink and purple dinosaurs -- and was finishing the guest list and menu.
Her husband arrived to pick her and the baby up after his shift as a delivery driver for an industrial gas company, and they made a quick stop for a prescription at the Leroy Pharmacy on East 198th Street.
"Lock the doors just in case they try to steal me and Catherine," Ms. Gomez, 34, recalled telling him from the back of the car, where the baby was dozing.
Mr. Arias, 35, went straight to the rear of the pharmacy to retrieve the medication. The store was loud and packed with people wearing masks to protect themselves from Covid-19. He waited in line.
Outside, men were lurking with guns, trying to protect the turf where they were selling cocaine, according to federal prosecutors.
There were one, two, three shots, and then the sound of something hitting the window of the family's Nissan.
Ms. Gomez had learned from a young age to "stop and drop," not just for fires but for shootings, too. She went to grab Catherine from her car seat so that they could both hide behind the driver's seat, but found her baby's body "full of blood."
Ms. Gomez unlocked the car and screamed for help. Catherine's lips turned blue, and Ms. Gomez laid her on the hood of the car and started to give her CPR. A woman gave her a towel and told her to apply pressure to the wound, but Ms. Gomez couldn't find it. There was blood everywhere, soaking Catherine's pink jacket.
The bullet had traveled through the back window, the leather seat and Catherine's car seat, before striking the area between her jaw and skull and traveling up through the left side of her head.
When Mr. Arias returned, he found his wife holding the baby, repeating, "'It's OK, baby. It's OK. It's OK." She told him to call 911.
Mr. Arias froze, his fingers hovering over his cellphone but unable to dial.
"I'm seeing her, but I'm not seeing her," Mr. Arias recalled. "I'm seeing death, I see her passing because she's not responding."
'One too many'
Catherine underwent seven hours of brain surgery. She suffered a seizure and a stroke during the procedure, which led to hemiparesis, or weakness on the right side of her body.
She spent her first birthday in the hospital: Ms. Gomez placed her party outfit over her body on the hospital bed.
That May, Catherine had titanium mesh implanted on the left side of her skull. In October, the mesh was replaced with a titanium plate, which takes the place of the side of her skull that the bullet shattered.
Catherine still has visual impairment, difficulty swallowing and a number of other medical challenges because of the wound, said Dr. Kathy Silverman, a pediatrician who worked with her for three months.
"The brain is the control center for the body," Dr. Silverman said. "So it's not just the brain but every other organ system that you have to keep an eye on when a child comes in with that kind of injury."
Dr. Silverman, who has worked at the hospital, north of New York City, for more than 20 years, has treated a number of children with gunshot wounds over her career, including children who have shot themselves, those who have been targeted by shooters and those like Catherine, who were caught in the crossfire.
"Having one child with gunshot wounds is one too many," Dr. Silverman said. "This is a child that needs to be followed over time very closely by a number of physicians, a rehab doctor, a pediatrician, her surgeons, and she needs that intensive rehab to be able to gain the functional skills back."
"She's still very young," Dr. Silverman added.
Cheerios and a climbing wall
For a while, Catherine refused to sit in a car seat.
"I guess maybe she felt the same way she was like when it happened," Ms. Gomez said, "feeling what she was sitting in at the time, so we had to switch it up."
Catherine's car seat is no longer secured to the middle of the back seat as it was the night of the shooting, and is instead buckled in behind the driver's seat. To the right of the seat, the dent the bullet made can still be seen in the car's leather interior.
On a recent morning, Ms. Gomez picked Catherine up out of her car seat and carried her into the hospital for therapy. Catherine would spend the next three hours in a program for children with medically complex needs. One young boy wore a yellow backpack that contained feeding tubes. A 3-year-old girl had a tracheotomy to help her breathe.
The classroom was full of natural light streaming in from four skylights. Children squealed and giggled as they played.
"I make a bottle," Catherine said as she held toy milk up to a doll in a white highchair. "Good job!" the staff called out. "Yay! You did it!"
But the morning wasn't just for play. Catherine would also undergo dysphagia therapy: exercises to help her eat and drink on her own.
"Which one do you want? Froot Loops or Cheerios?" Gina D. Longarzo, a therapist, asked. Catherine pointed to the heart-shaped Cheerios, kicking her legs under the table.
"We're going to pour the milk," Ms. Longarzo said. "Do you want to help Gina?"
The gunshot wound slowed Catherine's muscles and the timeliness of her swallowing. She initially had a nasal gastric tube before she graduated to eating purée and thick liquids.
Now, she's working on solids, thin liquids and her aversion to food.
"Good job, baby!" Ms. Longarzo said as Catherine used her left hand to lift a pink spoon, with her name written on the handle, to her mouth. "Yay!"
"Heart!" Catherine exclaimed, analyzing the contents of her bowl. "Nice heart!"
Catherine had been crawling and standing before the shooting, but the injury set her back. Initially, her physical therapy involved learning again to sit upright and to control her trunk and head without support.
That day, her task in physical therapy was to scale a rock-climbing wall and grab Mickey Mouse heads attached to string, to practice using both sides of her body. In her pink floral Nike sneakers she jumped, climbed and crawled beneath an obstacle course set up near the wall.
"She's doing really well," said Brendan Bacon, her physical therapist. He plans to make sure she continues to hit her milestones.
Catherine's parents are doing their best to make sure she has the treatment she needs. Early on, Ms. Gomez and Mr. Arias exhausted not only the $ 8,000 they had in savings, but also $ 30,000 they had received through a GoFundMe campaign that a family member set up for them, largely because they didn't have health benefits at the time of the shooting; they do now. They said they were still scrambling to make ends meet.
Catherine's older sisters are in trauma therapy. Haylee, 12, has shut down emotionally, Ms. Gomez said. Seven-year-old Delilah, formerly a star student, has become defiant and uninterested in completing her schoolwork.
'A miracle'
On Aug. 9, federal authorities announced the arrests of Ahmed Altorei and Samuel Bautista in connection with Catherine's shooting. Mr. Altorei, 36, and Mr. Bautista, 30, were charged with distributing drugs and carrying guns in connection with a drug trafficking operation, federal prosecutors said in an unsealed indictment.
The U.S. attorney, Damian Williams, called it "a miracle" that Catherine survived the shooting, but said "the emotional and physical trauma will never go away."
Ms. Gomez and Mr. Arias brought Catherine to the men's first court appearance. Ms. Gomez said she was surprised to see that they had no family there with them.
"That, to me, shows that perhaps they, as children, found a way to fit in and found love in the streets, which is why they lead those lifestyles," Ms. Gomez said. She wondered what was missing in their childhoods -- and said she initially had the urge to hug them.
One of the men looked remorseful, Ms. Gomez said, but the other seemed to scrutinize her family judgmentally. Whatever fleeting compassion she had was gone.
If the men are convicted, Ms. Gomez said, she prays that their time in prison teaches them something. For now, the family plans to keep attending the court appearances, and bringing Catherine.
"This little face: That's going to be your cross to bear every day," Mr. Arias said.
In the meantime, the family continues to take Catherine to her treatments. They are saving money to move, perhaps to North Carolina.
Ms. Gomez said Catherine still gets headaches near where the bullet entered her skull: "She'll point to the wound, where the bullet went in, and she'll say, 'boo-boo, boo-boo."'

Suarez Ends 2024 Campaign After Failing to Reach Debate: [National Desk]

Full text: The mayor of Miami, who had announced his run in June, had not qualified for the first Republican debate last week.
Mayor Francis X. Suarez of Miami dropped out of the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination on Tuesday, after failing to gain traction in a crowded field and falling short of the requirements to participate in the first Republican debate.
"Throughout this process, I have met so many freedom-loving Americans who care deeply about our nation, her people and its future," Mr. Suarez posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. "It was a privilege to come so close to appearing onstage with the other candidates at last week's first debate."
Mr. Suarez, 45, wrote in the posting on Tuesday that he was suspending his campaign for president. He had announced his run in June, joining an already-crowded cast of Republicans vying for the nomination, including a former vice president, a U.S. senator, several governors -- and a former president whose dominance in polls has been steady throughout the race.
No one has ever ascended to the presidency directly from a mayoral office. As the sole Latino candidate -- he is Cuban American -- Mr. Suarez played up his ability to appeal to a diverse group of voters. He promoted a boilerplate G.O.P. platform in which he called to curb violent crime, suggested giving U.S. companies incentives to leave China and expressed support for a 15-week national abortion ban with exceptions.
The first in the 2024 race to drop out, Mr. Suarez told reporters at the Iowa State Fair on Aug. 11 that any candidate who failed to make the debate stage should bow out.
To participate in the debate, candidates needed a minimum of 40,000 unique donors, which Mr. Suarez said he had attained, and at least 1 percent in three qualifying polls. Mr. Suarez posted a video online celebrating his supposed qualification on Aug. 18. But three days later, the Republican National Committee announced a debate stage lineup that left him out.
After acknowledging his failure to make the debate stage on X, Mr. Suarez went dormant on social media and did not hold campaign events in the days following the debate.
During his campaign, Mr. Suarez often took shots at the governor of his home state, Ron DeSantis, including criticizing legislation that banned discussions of gender identity and sexual orientation in schools and poking fun at Mr. DeSantis's dispute with Disney. But he rarely attacked the party's front-runner, former President Donald J. Trump, and suggested that he would be open to pardoning him if convicted in any of his four indictments.
A technology enthusiast, Mr. Suarez also experimented with novel means of attracting voters and created an "A.I. Suarez" in his likeness that, when prompted, explained his policy stances on a host of issues as its mouth moved in a somewhat-humanlike fashion. But his campaign never really took off, and his most favorable polls showed him hovering around 1 percent support, at best.
The mayor faces allegations of peddling influence on behalf of a real estate development company. The Miami Herald reported that Mr. Suarez was paid at least $ 170,000 by Location Ventures "to help cut through red tape and secure critical permits." The Herald later reported that the F.B.I. was investigating if those payments constituted bribes.
In his statement on X on Tuesday, he stressed a need for Republicans to do "more to include and attract" Hispanic voters, among other demographics, whom he said "the left has taken for granted for far too long."
"Younger voters, independents, urban voters and suburban women -- all of whom I've carried in previous elections -- among others, should find a comfortable home in the G.O.P. and its policies," he said.

A Toddler’s Long, Slow Road to Recovery After a Shooting

NEW YORK — It was story time. A pair of 2-year-olds sat on miniature chairs pulled up to a miniature table at Blythedale Children’s Hospital in Valhalla, New York, listening attentively.
“We have so many animals that have boo-boos in our book,” a brown-haired woman said in a singsong voice, holding up a book called “All Better!”
“Feel better, doggy,” one of the toddlers, a girl with seven braids, said as she placed a red Band-Aid sticker on the paw of a dog in the book.
The girl, Catherine Arias, was herself recovering from a very real and much more grievous injury. In January 2022, days away from her first birthday, she was caught in the crossfire of a shooting outside a pharmacy in the Bronx borough of New York City. The bullet penetrated the left side of her brain, leaving her with a traumatic injury and weakness on the right side of her body. More than a year and a half later, she still requires five days of therapy every week to improve her ability to eat, talk and move.
This month, federal prosecutors announced the arrest of two men in connection with Catherine’s shooting, a relief to her parents, who have struggled for months to come to terms with the calamity.
“I just started crying — I couldn’t talk after that,” Gregory Arias, Catherine’s father, said.
“It was like a dry-heave cry,” said Miraida Gomez, her mother. “The cry that I didn’t get to have processing everything that we’ve been through was the cry that I had that morning.”
The shooting and its aftermath — expensive medical treatment for Catherine, worry over the emotional health of her two older sisters, court appearances for the accused men — have left the family with complicated and conflicting emotions.
Gomez and Arias, high school sweethearts, have deep ties to the Bronx, where they were born and raised. They were keenly aware of the violence that can plague their neighborhood.
Catherine was one of 56 children shot in the Bronx last year, the highest tally of any part of the city, according to New York Police Department data. Her injury and her long road to recovery are a grim reminder of the life-altering consequences of gun violence across the city, even when shootings are not fatal.
Yet Gomez, a social worker, found herself struggling with something approaching sympathy for the men arrested, wondering what was missing in their childhoods that had led them to the streets.
Still, Catherine’s parents are eager to provide a far better life for their own children and are now saving money to move out of the Bronx — out of the city altogether.
‘I’m seeing death’
On Jan. 19, 2022, Gomez had finished work and was excitedly planning Catherine’s first birthday party at her mother’s house. She had decided on the theme — pink and purple dinosaurs — and was finishing the guest list and menu.
Her husband arrived to pick her and the baby up after his shift as a delivery driver for an industrial gas company, and they made a quick stop for a prescription at the Leroy Pharmacy on East 198th Street.
“Lock the doors just in case they try to steal me and Catherine,” Gomez, 34, recalled telling him from the back of the car, where the baby was dozing.
Arias, 35, went straight to the rear of the pharmacy to retrieve the medication. The store was loud and packed with people wearing masks to protect themselves from COVID-19. He waited in line.
Outside, men were lurking with guns, trying to protect the turf where they were selling cocaine, according to federal prosecutors.
There were one, two, three shots, and then the sound of something hitting the window of the family’s Nissan.
Gomez had learned from a young age to “stop and drop,” not just for fires but for shootings, too. She went to grab Catherine from her car seat so that they could both hide behind the driver’s seat, but found her baby’s body “full of blood.”
Gomez unlocked the car and screamed for help. Catherine’s lips turned blue, and Gomez laid her on the hood of the car and started to give her CPR. A woman gave her a towel and told her to apply pressure to the wound, but Gomez couldn’t find it. There was blood everywhere, soaking Catherine’s pink jacket.
The bullet had traveled through the back window, the leather seat and Catherine’s car seat, before striking the area between her jaw and skull and traveling up through the left side of her head.
When Arias returned, he found his wife holding the baby, repeating, “‘It’s OK, baby. It’s OK. It’s OK.” She told him to call 911.
Arias froze, his fingers hovering over his cellphone but unable to dial.
“I’m seeing her, but I’m not seeing her,” Arias recalled. “I’m seeing death, I see her passing because she’s not responding.”
‘One too many’
Catherine underwent seven hours of brain surgery. She suffered a seizure and a stroke during the procedure, which led to hemiparesis, or weakness on the right side of her body.
She spent her first birthday in the hospital: Gomez placed her party outfit over her body on the hospital bed.
That May, Catherine had titanium mesh implanted on the left side of her skull. In October, the mesh was replaced with a titanium plate, which takes the place of the side of her skull that the bullet shattered.
Catherine still has visual impairment, difficulty swallowing and a number of other medical challenges because of the wound, said Dr. Kathy Silverman, a pediatrician who worked with her for three months.
“The brain is the control center for the body,” Silverman said. “So it’s not just the brain but every other organ system that you have to keep an eye on when a child comes in with that kind of injury.”
Silverman, who has worked at the hospital, north of New York City, for more than 20 years, has treated a number of children with gunshot wounds over her career, including children who have shot themselves, those who have been targeted by shooters and those like Catherine, who were caught in the crossfire.
“Having one child with gunshot wounds is one too many,” Silverman said. “This is a child that needs to be followed over time very closely by a number of physicians, a rehab doctor, a pediatrician, her surgeons, and she needs that intensive rehab to be able to gain the functional skills back.”
“She’s still very young,” Silverman added.
Cheerios and a climbing wall
For a while, Catherine refused to sit in a car seat.
“I guess maybe she felt the same way she was like when it happened,” Gomez said, “feeling what she was sitting in at the time, so we had to switch it up.”
Catherine’s car seat is no longer secured to the middle of the back seat as it was the night of the shooting, and is instead buckled in behind the driver’s seat. To the right of the seat, the dent the bullet made can still be seen in the car’s leather interior.

Now, she’s working on solids, thin liquids and her aversion to food.
“Good job, baby!” Longarzo said as Catherine used her left hand to lift a pink spoon, with her name written on the handle, to her mouth. “Yay!”
“Heart!” Catherine exclaimed, analyzing the contents of her bowl. “Nice heart!”
Catherine had been crawling and standing before the shooting, but the injury set her back. Initially, her physical therapy involved learning again to sit upright and to control her trunk and head without support.
That day, her task in physical therapy was to scale a rock-climbing wall and grab Mickey Mouse heads attached to string, to practice using both sides of her body. In her pink floral Nike sneakers she jumped, climbed and crawled beneath an obstacle course set up near the wall.

The Glories Of America's Wilderness: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: One of the paradoxes of urban America is that millions of people speak reverently about wilderness but are much less eager to venture into it and risk real bites from actual mosquitoes.
I've been musing about this while backpacking with family on the Pacific Northwest Trail, sometimes known as "America's wildest trail," on the Canada-U.S. border in Washington State. It's stunning, mountainous country, right at timberline in the Pasayten Wilderness -- yet we have it pretty much to ourselves (along with the bears, lynxes and mountain goats).
Perhaps I'm running away from home, for this is a dispiriting time in America: A former president has not only been indicted four times but may actually also be re-elected, our life expectancy is among the worst in the rich world and large majorities of adults polled say our country is on the wrong track.
Yet there's something still spectacularly right about the United States: our wild spaces. Some 40 percent of America is public land -- a credit to our forebears -- and we haven't screwed that up yet (although climate-change-related fires endanger it).
I'm hiking with my daughter and her boyfriend, and it's cathartic: We get up in the morning with the sun, drink from creeks, rest on logs, eat from our packs when hungry, and at dusk we find some flat ground, roll out a ground sheet, unfurl pads and sleeping bags and then fall asleep under the stars to the melody of owl hoots.
For me, wilderness backpacking is a profoundly healing experience. It restores my soul.
If much of modern life is exemplified by what we do on our screens -- firing off intemperate and shallow salvos on the platform X, what we used to call Twitter -- then wilderness offers an antidote. It is deep. It is enduring. It is soothing. The antonym of X is wilderness.
The best parenting I ever did was on the trails. Beginning when she was 14, my daughter and I hiked the entire 2,650-mile Pacific Crest Trail from Mexico to Canada, over six years. In that brief window in which she was strong enough and I was not yet decrepit, together we sweated, bathed in rivers, lost toenails, dodged 14 rattlesnakes and a cougar, and were drenched in freezing rains. No better way to share companionship!
It's a spiritual experience to hike through the cathedral of wilderness, whether alone or with a family member or friend; the mountains and rivers generate a quasi-religious awe and put us humans in our place. I understand Spinoza best not in the library but in the mountains.
That is not to diminish the significance of humans; on the contrary, wilderness is an example of the importance of public policy. The architects of our land policies were leaders like Theodore Roosevelt and his friend Gifford Pinchot (the first head of the U.S. Forest Service), who were personally wealthy and could afford their own country estates but deeply believed that working-class Americans should also have access to nature. Hence the drive for public lands.
When Congress rebelled at their conservation efforts and in 1907 made it harder to create new national forests, Roosevelt and Pinchot hurriedly preserved an additional 16 million acres -- so-called midnight forests, because they were created just before the deadline.
We're all beneficiaries of their vision, for wild places provide a rare zone of equality in an unequal nation. There are few places in America where a billionaire and a welder are on equal footing, but a wilderness trail is one; no one can pull rank on you, except a large bear.
As I see it, the purpose of our extraordinary American inheritance of public lands is to go out in them, to experience that healing power of nature. Yet perhaps three-quarters of Americans don't set foot on national forest trails at all.
Many children in particular seem to suffer from what the writer Richard Louv has called "nature-deficit disorder." That's the alienation from the natural world that arises when kids no longer tramp through the mud chasing tadpoles and garter snakes.
Perhaps we parents are overprotective, fearing that mud might be quicksand or that garter snakes might be rattlesnakes. And modern life feels increasingly sedentary and pampered: On a baking summer day, kids no longer cool off in a swimming hole, but rather stay inside air-conditioned rooms playing video games, oblivious to their deprivation.
When young Americans don't interact with the outdoors, something is lost for all of us -- including a visceral appreciation of what wilderness is. In our dreams, it may be romantic and Disney-like; in reality, you're always too hot or too cold, all trails are mostly uphill, and that brown lump you just kicked is a wasp nest. All true, but that reality is bewitching.
So, my advice: Go take a hike, and bring the kids.

Full text: I've got 99 problems with A.I., but intellectual property ain't one.
Media and entertainment industries have lately been consumed with questions about how content generated by artificial intelligence systems should be considered under intellectual property law. Last week a federal judge ruled against an attempt to copyright art produced by a machine. In July another federal judge suggested in a hearing that he would most likely dismiss a copyright infringement lawsuit brought by artists against several artificial intelligence art generators. How A.I. might alter the economics of the movie and TV business has become one of the primary issues in the strike by writers and actors in Hollywood. And major news companies -- including The Times -- are weighing steps to guard the intellectual property that flows from their journalism.
In the face of all the possible actions against A.I. and its makers, I'd suggest caution. I've been thinking a lot about whether musicians, painters, photographers, writers, filmmakers and other producers of creative work -- including, on good days, myself -- should fear that machines might damage their livelihoods. After extensive research and consultation with experts, I've arrived at a carefully considered, nuanced position: meh.
Controversies over A.I. are going to put a lot of copyright lawyers' kids through college. But the more I use ChatGPT, Midjourney and other A.I. tools, the more I suspect that many of the intellectual property questions they prompt will prove less significant than we sometimes assume. That's because computers by themselves cannot yet and might never be able to produce truly groundbreaking creative work.
Indeed, I'd bet that artists and creative industries will ultimately find A.I. to be more of a boon than a competitor. In a recent assessment of A.I.-produced comedy, Jason Zinoman, The Times's comedy critic, suggested that A.I. comedians might improve human comedy: "Competition from increasingly clever computer programs will force artists to not only rely more on intuition than imitation, but also to think harder about what makes them, and their work, distinctly human."
I think he's right -- not just about comedy but also about many other creative fields. What accounts for my sunny stance? History offers one clue: Technologies that made art easier to produce have rarely ended up stifling human creativity. Electronic synthesizers didn't eliminate the need for people who play musical instruments. Auto-Tune didn't make singing on pitch obsolete. Photography didn't kill painting, and its digitization didn't obviate the need for professional photographers.
Then there's the content I've seen A.I. produce: Unless it's been heavily worked over by human beings, a lot of the music, images, jokes and stories that A.I. has given us so far have felt more like great mimicry than great art. Sure, it's impressive that ChatGPT can write a pop song in the style of Taylor Swift. But the ditties still smack of soulless imitation. They're not going to go platinum or sell out stadiums. A.I. might undermine some of the more high-volume corners of photography -- stock photos, for instance -- but will you use it to capture your wedding or to document a war? Nope.
Which is not to suggest there won't still be a lot of legal wrangling. Mark Lemley, a professor at Stanford Law School who teaches and litigates on issues of intellectual property law, told me that he thinks the next five to 10 years will be marked by a series of legal battles about the role A.I plays in media. "The number of issues is going to expand and get more complicated," he said.
Lemley is one of the lawyers representing the A.I. firm Stability AI in a copyright infringement lawsuit brought by artists. At the heart of that suit is the issue of how A.I. systems are trained. Most gain their smarts by analyzing enormous amounts of digital content, including lots of copyrighted work. Which prompts the question: Should the artists be compensated for their contributions, and if so, how?
To me, the answer is no. When a machine is trained to understand language and culture by poring over a lot of stuff online, it is acting, philosophically at least, just like a human being who draws inspiration from existing work. I don't mind if human readers are informed or inspired by reading my work -- that's why I do it! -- so why should I fret that computers will be?
Of course, one reason I might mind is if the machine uses what it learns from reading my work to produce work that could substitute for my own. But at the risk of hubris, I don't think that's likely in the foreseeable future. For me, a human creator's very humanity feels like the ultimate trump card over the machines: Who cares about a computer's opinion on anything?
Another question is how we should think about potential infringement by content produced by machines. Current copyright law is designed to protect specific creative works, not a general creative style. But if A.I. can copy an artist well enough to essentially duplicate the artist's work, could that rise to the level of infringement? In a recent paper, Lemley and his co-authors suggested the following hypothetical: Someone sets up a site that creates "an auto-generated story about Yoda" every time a user visits. If the site charges users for the content, Lemley and colleagues argue, it could infringe Disney's copyright -- even if a human did not create the words and images about Yoda.
Such scenarios may not be hypothetical for long; A.I. generators are very good at creating near-exact copies of many well-known characters. When I asked Midjourney to show me "a small green fellow who has trained Jedi for 800 years," its output was pretty spot on.
Which raises a related issue: Can the prompts we give A.I. be protected by copyright law? There are already prompt marketplaces, in which people sell the particular incantations they fed to A.I. to produce certain works. Can that really fly?
No doubt these questions are important, but it's not hard to think of reasonable answers. A.I. probably shouldn't be allowed to create direct copies of existing works, but it seems wise to allow it the same freedom to remix art that humans enjoy.
I wouldn't allow the most common prompts to be copyrightable -- you can't claim any creativity in asking an A.I. to draw a cat -- but prompts with some level of human inspiration should qualify as protectable work. After all, when I ask Midjourney to make "a cat smoking a pipe photographed on a Civil War battlefield," I am engaged in at least a certain degree of creative work. The pipe-smoking Civil War cat was conjured by my human brain. But are such simple strings of keywords -- not much more than I would enter into a search engine -- enough to qualify as copyrightable creations? At the moment, we don't really know.
But until we do, I leave you with my masterpiece:

Full text: Family life in Scheffel Hall, a New York City landmark, could get a little complicated.
I was 15 the first time it happened.
I was staring at the empty apartment and wondering what would happen if the police figured out what my dad had done.
For years, my family had been living in a commercial building -- illegal for residential use -- above my father's Pilates studio. He had opened it in 1998 at Scheffel Hall, a New York City landmark on Third Avenue dating to 1895.
Modeled after a 17th-century castle in Heidelberg, Germany, the building has an intricate terra-cotta facade. The interior is a little spooky, with intricately carved dark wood, gargoyles perched near the ceiling, trap doors and dumbwaiters. A golden statue of the Roman goddess Flora watches over the front hall.
Scheffel Hall served as the beer-soaked setting for one of O. Henry's stories and once housed a jazz club, Fat Tuesday's. Within one of the walls, my father discovered a trove of framed photographs from a New York that had long ago passed of existence. My favorite was the portrait of Daisy and Violet Hilton, conjoined twins who worked the vaudeville circuit.
My dad adorned the walls with these pictures, along with some large-format, pixelated images of his heroes, among them Gandhi, the Dalai Lama and Gurdjieff. Pilates exercise machines took up space in the main room beneath a stained glass skylight that showed half-moons smoking cigars.
His Pilates studio, the Movement Salon, never made a profit, as far as I know, but for years it functioned as an eccentric gathering spot for people in the neighborhood. I think some of them came just to see my father, who, for 40 years, owned several of the city's most successful Italian American restaurants. In 2009, when I was 11, he relocated us from our previous apartment to Scheffel Hall after a financially ruinous lawsuit.
We lived there without incident until one evening during my sophomore year in high school, when my dad received a notice from the New York City Department of Buildings. Someone had filed a complaint that there were people living in a building designated for commercial use only, and an inspector would be paying us a visit.
After reading the notice aloud to me and my sister, my father slammed his fist on the rickety computer table, sending mugs and pens jumping. Suddenly, he looked up at us. "We'll just hide," he said.
"What?" I said. "I wish we could afford to move out."
"It's not an issue of money!" he yelled, although it very much was. He looked around the room. "Sheds," he said. "We need sheds."
Within 12 hours, with a porter's help, he had built a few sheds on the roof. The plan was for us to put all of our belongings up there, to hide the evidence that people were living there.
The beds were the hardest things to move. I remember pushing my mattress through the window of the attic room I shared with my sister, the pressure building on my fingertips as it slipped from my hands and she tried to lug it onto the roof.
"Micky, you gotta push up!" my dad screamed.
In the next phase of the operation, he handed me a black plastic garbage bag. "Take everything off the walls," he said.
I paused to glance at the framed photograph of my dad with the actor Mickey Rourke, taken at one of his now-shuttered restaurants.
"Don't worry," he said. "We'll put them back ... afterward."
I pulled other pictures off the walls, too: me, grinning, with a missing front tooth, at Disney World; our family, 10 years earlier, feeding birds in Sag Harbor; my sister and me, making snow angels in Gramercy Park. I piled them into the bag, along with medical bills, my black binder from poetry camp and the items on my dad's night stand, including a gold figurine of Baby Jesus that he kissed every night before bed.
Into other bags went his books and papers, a motley collection that included 200 pages of Wikipedia material on the pineal gland and nonfiction works like "Eros Unredeemed, The Hope: A Guide to Sacred Activism," "Terra Nova: The Global Revolution and the Healing of Love" and "Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers."
Then my sister and I bagged up the stuff in the attic -- colorful shirts from Forever 21, leggings from H & M and makeup from CVS, along with plastic jewelry and school books. I scrawled my name in all-caps on white paper and taped it to the bag that was mine. The only thing we left behind was my unwieldy science project, which we hid in the closet.
Then came what was perhaps the most important part of the ruse: My dad printed signs and posted them all over the building. "EMPLOYEE KITCHEN: PLEASE LEAVE KITCHEN CLEANER THAN YOU FOUND IT," read the one by the stove. "LAUNDRY: Acupuncture Linens Only!" read the sign above the washing machines.
He put two signs in the attic. The one on the door read, "MASSAGE ROOM 1: SESSION IN PROGRESS, DO NOT ENTER." And the sign by the closet that concealed my science project read, "MASSAGE SUPPLIES."
Within three days, we had packed up the whole place. I sat on our stained brown couch and stared into the vacant expanse. I'd be sleeping at a friend's house that night, but my dad planned to stay at the Movement Salon. I thought about losing him, with visions of the inspector taking him away. Tears streamed out of my eyes, dotting the fabric beneath me.
I was at school when the man from the Department of Buildings came. My father told me about the visit afterward.
When the inspector arrived, my dad said that a "crazy lady across the street" was the one who had called in the complaint, adding that there was nothing to it. Then he looked on as the man went from room to room. Everything was going according to plan until the inspector reached my attic room. He stepped across the creaky floor toward the closet, approaching the "MASSAGE SUPPLIES" sign.
"Oh, give me a break!" my dad said.
The inspector paused.
"You're really going to turn over every last tiny thing?"
The inspector nodded and turned away. Moments later, on the main floor, he scrawled something on a white form and handed it to my father.
"You passed," he said.
Two years later, when I was 17, my dad learned he had esophageal cancer. A few days after the diagnosis, he became convinced that the plaster ceiling outside the attic bedroom concealed a skylight. He cut open the ceiling. The dust infiltrated every room, shoe and lung in the house, but he was right. His efforts revealed a stained glass skylight that transformed my gloomy stairwell into a rainbow jewel box of miraculous pinks and blues.

Full text: Ron DeSantis faulted Donald Trump for the Covid lockdowns during his presidency. Nikki Haley slammed him for runaway government spending. They did so early during the Republican presidential debate on Wednesday night, and they did so readily, as if showing voters just how dauntless and independent they were. What guts!
What bunk. When they were later asked to raise their hands if they would support Trump as the 2024 Republican nominee even if he'd been convicted of a felony, up shot DeSantis's arm. Haley's, too. No hesitation. No equivocation. No concern about which of Trump's 91 felony counts might be under discussion. No insistence that they'd have to see how strong the evidence turned out to be. Just fealty. It's what the Republican electorate seems to insist on, so it's what all eight candidates onstage in Milwaukee except Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson pledged.
The degrees of that fealty varied widely. On the wobbly end was Mike Pence, whose campaign arc has been the continued growth of a spine sorely missing during almost the entirety of the Trump administration. At the debate, that backbone had a big, thrilling, strangely poignant spurt.
Although Pence indicated the same perverse willingness as DeSantis and Haley to look past Trump's possible rap sheet, he also delivered a soliloquy that didn't just establish but exulted in his refusal on Jan. 6, 2021, to grant Trump's request that he not certify Joe Biden's election victory.
"He asked me to put him over the Constitution, and I chose the Constitution," Pence said. "And I always will." He sounded and looked grave and grandfatherly. And with that same voice, that same mien, he implored voters to think long and hard about electing anybody who would elevate political survival above all else. That was an instruction to turn away from Trump.
But the party is not turning away from Trump, and that was the moral of an event at which Trump was physically absent but spiritually present, an oppressive orange specter manifest in the bits and pieces of him that the candidates other than Christie and Hutchinson reassembled into their own political identities -- and in their unwillingness to do what most needed doing and tell their party the full truth about Trump's lies.
The Fox News moderators, to their great credit, didn't actually focus on Trump until the second of the debate's two hours, and even then they kept the back-and-forth about him relatively brief.
But that Trumpy interlude underscored the fundamental timidity and incoherence of candidates who are trying to beat Trump without beating up on him much, who are arguing that they'd make better nominees without using the most relevant and compelling ammunition against him. Their debate performances mingled moral cowardice with political malpractice to produce a baffling, exasperating, infuriating spectacle.
How can someone praise Pence for standing up to Trump on the day of the insurrection -- an expression of admiration that implicitly acknowledges Trump's treasonous ways -- only to brush off the current prosecutions of the former president as a terrifying politicization of justice and deem Trump eligible to return to the White House? That was the oxymoronic and utterly moronic position of many of the candidates on the stage. In that sense, they were miniature Trumps, cracked mirrors of the master. They were putting their own political ambitions first.
Actually, Vivek Ramaswamy's agitated, hyperbolic, comically exuberant turn traveled beyond pragmatic calculation into a whole different, more disturbing realm, that of Trump fanboy, Trump sycophant. I assume this was his audition to be Trump's running mate?
He called Trump "the best president of the 21st century," which put Trump ahead of only one other Republican commander in chief, but that wasn't even his strangest and most slavish act of worship. No, he topped it when he proudly asked who among his bickering rivals had the "courage" -- he really used that word -- to promise that on Day 1 of their presidency, they'd pardon Trump of whatever might need pardoning.
They seemed to ignore him, at least then, though they swatted him down at other junctures. Rising in the polls and ripe for attack, he got schooled by Haley on foreign policy, by Pence on our country's ability to tackle several challenges at once, by Christie on his lack of experience and unwarranted confidence.
All of 38 years old, Ramaswamy is like Trump in the larval stage, molting toward the full MAGA wingspan but not quite there yet. His narcissism, though, is fully evolved. On social media in the days leading up to the debate, he posted a video of himself in "three hours of solid debate prep." It showed him playing tennis -- shirtless. Call it an underdressed overshare, as well as an unsubtle reminder that a certain older, rounder, slower front-runner favors the more aerobically forgiving habitat of the golf course. I guess Ramaswamy does have a Trump dig or two in him, but they're subliminal backhands.
On Wednesday night, Ramaswamy took his lickings and kept on ticking, muscling his callow way into as many topics of discussion as he could. And there were topics galore, as the moderators marched the candidates through abortion, Ukraine, education, immigration, government spending, climate change and more. That tour revealed Haley's desire to be seen as somewhat moderate and less vain and rash than the men; Tim Scott's rearing by a poor, single mother; and Christie's ability to survive a tsunami of booing.
Doug Burgum and Asa Hutchinson occupied lecterns, too. But I've already forgotten them, and I suspect that other viewers and most voters will follow suit.
And Ron DeSantis? Did he invigorate his candidacy or invite its last rites?
He was loud, I'll give him that. He smiled when a smile was in order, punched the air with his fist and trotted out that "stone cold dead" phrase that he has used before to describe the fate he'll mete out to drug dealers who cross the country's southwestern border.
But he had to be dragged to the statement that Pence did right on Jan. 6. He was mealy-mouthed on aid to Ukraine, suggesting he'd cut it off but then saying that his real concern was that Western European countries pony up more. (Gee, where have we heard that before?) He was blurry as often as he was bold, and that's no way to catch up to Trump, let alone overtake him.
But is DeSantis really trying all that hard? Apart from Christie, are any of them? Like their ethically rotten party, they're hostage to a serially indicted huckster and seem to be waiting for some twist of fate or act of magic to make it all better.
I share Ramaswamy's hunger for real courage. But I define it differently than he does, and on Wednesday night, I was famished.
What I'm Listening to, Reading and Playing
Banned books. Cancel culture. This troubled chapter of American life calls for reacquaintance with the importance of free speech, and the acclaimed writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie delivered a distilled, persuasive case for it in a late-2022 lecture that only recently crossed my radar. You can listen to it here or here. The precision of her words -- and of her delivery -- is thrilling.
I've written, in the context of college today, about the perils of achievement culture, a theme present in two new books. "Never Enough," by Jennifer Breheny Wallace, was published on Tuesday and praised by Publishers Weekly. Early next week, Ana Homayoun's "Erasing the Finish Line: The New Blueprint for Success Beyond Grades and College Admission," will be released.
I tripped across a plug for the singer-songwriter Olivia Dean in late June, in a flattering appraisal of her new album, "Messy," by the Times critic Jon Pareles, and then again more recently in the "Summer Strut" edition of Slate's Culture Gabfest. I'm grateful. While a few tracks on "Messy," including the opener, left me cold, the best songs ("The Hardest Part," "No Man," "Ladies Room") are deeply pleasurable throwbacks -- they sound almost like resurfaced pop-soul from decades ago, but with a contemporary gloss.
I've become a huge fan of The Times's newest daily game, Connections, which challenges you to organize 16 words correctly into four groups of four. That can be tricky: In one edition, "month," "year," "decade," "century" and "millennium" were all in play, but that's five measures of time. You had to realize that "month" belonged with "juror," "rose" and "egg," all of which come by the dozen. I used to begin every morning with just the Spelling Bee and the Mini Crossword. Then I added Wordle. Now, Connections. Stop it, New York Times! I have work to attend to!
For the Love of Sentences
In The Atlantic, James Parker looked back at the life and art of Edvard Munch: "Like Dostoyevsky before him, like Kafka after him, he was one of those somewhat hastily assembled humans -- the skull plates not stapled down, the nerve endings dangling -- who get chosen by the daemon of history to bear its message into the world." (Thanks to Kathleen Mazzocco of Nice, France, for nominating this.) From that same article, about "The Scream," Munch's most famous work: "It's a cave painting on the inner wall of the human skull." (Margaret Sinclair, Skokie, Ill.)
Also in The Atlantic, Derek Thompson needled erroneous recession soothsayers: "Economic models of the future are perhaps best understood as astrology faintly decorated with calculus equations." (Rick Osmon, El Sobrante, Calif., and Allan Parnell, Hillsborough, N.C.)
And Rebecca Giggs paid tribute to a winged wonder: "The owl was the size of a terrier, but languidly buoyant in the way of a day-old Mylar balloon." (Viki Maxwell, Oakland, Calif.) This whole article was, um, a hoot, and it reminded me of all the splendid prose that writers who focus on the natural world have produced. I routinely revisit the excellent work of Natalie Angier, who covered science for The Times for many years and won a Pulitzer Prize for this collection of articles, including several about animals. Interestingly, Jonathan Franzen recently wrote an essay for The New Yorker titled "The Problem of Nature Writing," in which he maintains that it often misses its mark. His sentences perfectly hit theirs. "Joy can be as strong as Everclear or as mild as Coors Light, but it's never not joy: a blossoming in the heart, a yes to the world, a yes to being alive in it," he wrote.
Also in The New Yorker, Zach Helfand explained the fascination with monster trucks in terms of our worship of size, noting that "people have always liked really big stuff, particularly of the unnecessary variety. Stonehenge, pyramids, colossi, Costco." (Doris McInnes, Greenwood, S.C.)
In Vanity Fair, Susan Casey reflected on the mind-set of Stockton Rush, the OceanGate chief executive who brushed off warnings about his Titan submersible: "In a culture that has adopted the ridiculous mantra 'move fast and break things,' that type of arrogance can get a person far. But in the deep ocean, the price of admission is humility -- and it's nonnegotiable. The abyss doesn't care if you went to Princeton, or that your ancestors signed the Declaration of Independence. If you want to go down into her world, she sets the rules." (Debbie Landis, Garrison, N.Y.)
In The Boston Globe, Alex Speier likened the Red Sox pitcher Chris Sale's reliably occurring injuries to "so many buzzers in a game of Operation." (Bill Keveney, Beverly Hills, Calif.)
In The Washington Post, Matt Bai traced The Indicted One's limits: "Asking Donald Trump to pledge loyalty to anything really, other than himself, is like asking my dog to write a novel. She might look at you like she understands the concept, but trust me, she doesn't." (Reid Cushman, Miami, and Ste Kubenka, Austin, Tex.)
In Esquire, Charles P. Pierce declared: "There is no earthly reason for Disney to drop its lawsuit against Florida just because Ron DeSantis says Florida's going to win it. A dream is a wish your heart makes, but not in a courtroom." (Chuck Carlin, Leesburg, Va.)
In The Times, Rico Gagliano nailed the capital of the West Coast: "Los Angeles is the promise of speed denied." He noted that it's "a city of five-lane freeways where traffic crawls" and "the birthplace of In-N-Out Burger -- its very name auguring swift satisfaction -- where the drive-through lines stretch to infinity. Behold the Maseratis in the queue: eager to race, forced to idle. Angelenos know the feeling." (Lisa Smith, Pacific Palisades, Calif., and Robert Weimer, Los Angeles)
Also in The Times, Alexis Soloski described her encounter with the actor Taylor Kitsch: "There's a lonesomeness at the core of him that makes women want to save him and men want to buy him a beer. I am a mother of young children and the temptation to offer him a snack was sometimes overwhelming." (Peter M. Handler, Chicago)
David Gates reviewed "Sun House," a new novel by David James Duncan. "Duncan is a serial over-insister," he wrote, "especially when he tries to eff the ineffable: Characters continually find themselves 'undone,' 'overcome,' 'stunned,' 'gutted,' 'slammed' and 'moved beyond words.' True, some words are best moved beyond." (Scott Williams, Salt Lake City)
Kyle Buchanan celebrated bad movie accents on the grounds that movies are "dream worlds that ask us to believe in things as outlandish as multiverses, 10-foot-tall blue people, or Mark Wahlberg playing a science teacher." (Mary Melby, Tempe, Ariz.)
Roger Cohen defined many strains of nationalism, including the current Russian one, as "a promise to change the present in the name of an illusory past in order to forge a future vague in all respects except its glory." (Allan Tarlow, West Hollywood, Calif.)
Maureen Dowd assessed Trump's relationship to his own stolen-election claims and concluded that "the putz knew his push for a putsch was dishonest." (Linda Mancini, Florence, Italy, and Demeter Manning, Olympia, Wash., among many others)
And Bret Stephens grappled with the expansive terrain covered by Trump's indictments: "Ninety-one counts in all. You could almost take 'em down and pass 'em around like bottles of beer on the wall." (Kathy Haynie, Oregon City, Ore., and Frank Ohrt, Houston, among many others)

Twitter
(Based on Shakespeare's Sonnet 18)
Shall I compare thee to a Facebook post?
Thou art more chatty and more volatile.
Rough winds do shake thee coast to coast
and Musk as owner doth impress his style.
Sometime too hot, the eye of commerce shines,
and oft your gold complexion dimmed
And share price tumbles and declines
by chance or Elon's wobbly course undimmed.
But thy true existence shall not fade
nor shall the image of your name at birth.
Nor shall that name by him mislaid
be lost to all who live on Earth
So long as men do breathe and Musk doth vex
So life goes on, tho' Twitter morph to X.

From Satires to Vampires on Hulu: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: The Disney-owned Hulu streaming service is a repository for many new TV shows. But savvy viewers can also find a rotating library of movies, both recent releases and classics, rivaling the collections of many of its competitors -- if they know where to look. We're here to help.
'The Craft' (1996)
Misfits and weirdos will love this supernatural thriller-drama, in which a nervous new girl (Robin Tunney) at a Catholic high school turns to a trio of outcasts (Neve Campbell, Fairuza Balk and Rachel True) for friendship, and their tight-knit group turns into a witches' coven. The witty script (by Peter Filardi and Andrew Fleming, the film's director) nicely quenches one's thirst for teenage vengeance, with all the proper parties getting their deserved comeuppance. But it's not just a gimmick movie; all four protagonists create distinctive characters of genuine depth, lending weight to what could have been a throwaway genre exercise.
'Community' (2009-2015)
Loners at a subpar community college join in a study group to muddle through their joke of a Spanish class and end up forging unexpected bonds from their shared misery. It sounds like the setup for a crushingly typical TV sitcom, but "Community" is anything but; over its six tempestuous seasons, the creator, Dan Harmon, and his inventive writers, turned the classroom laugher into a "bracingly funny" and slyly surreal blend of sketch comedy, science fiction and metatelevision -- while simultaneously creating the kind of complicated but sympathetic characters and delicate relationships it seemed too cool to indulge. ("Community" fans will also enjoy Harmon's cult cartoon series "Rick and Morty.")
'The Death of Stalin' (2018)
The director Armando Iannucci honed his ruthless sense of political satire on the television shows "Veep" and "The Thick of It" (and in the latter's cinematic spinoff "In the Loop"). Those projects were all set in something resembling our present; this adaptation of graphic novels by Fabien Nury and Thierry Robin is set in the historical past, but the period trappings do nothing to dull Iannucci's razor-sharp wit (or to stop viewers from connecting the text to the present day). Set in the days immediately preceding and following the titular event, Iannucci masterfully orchestrates the farcical comings and goings, as well as the back-stabbings and power plays, of a marvelous ensemble cast, including Simon Russell Beale, Steve Buscemi, Jason Isaacs, Michael Palin, Andrea Riseborough and Jeffrey Tambor. Our critic praised the picture's "brilliantly arranged mix of savage one-liners, lacerating dialogue and perfectly timed slapstick."
'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' (2008)
The actor turned screenwriter Jason Segel and his collaborator Nicholas Stoller first teamed up for this romantic comedy from the producer Judd Apatow. Segal stars as Peter, a sad-sack composer in a perpetual funk after his breakup with the title character (Kristen Bell), a famous TV actress. In an attempt to escape his depression, he takes a vacation to Hawaii -- only to find Sarah at the same resort with her new beau (Russell Brand), a pretentious British pop star. Mila Kunis co-stars as the resort receptionist who presents a new opportunity for love; Bill Hader, Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd and Jack McBrayer turn up in small but uproarious supporting roles. (For more romantic comedy, try "Sliding Doors" and "The Weekend.")
'Spencer' (2021)
Kristen Stewart picked up her first Academy Award nomination for her subtle yet affecting turn as Princess Diana in this atypical biographical fantasy from the director Pablo Larraín. Like his earlier "Jackie," a character sketch of Jacqueline Kennedy told only through the lens of the days after her husband's assassination, "Spencer" confines its time frame to a single holiday weekend near the end of Diana's marriage to Prince Charles, and its action to a remote mansion inhabited by both the royalty of the present and the ghosts of the past. A.O. Scott praised it as "an allegory of powerlessness, revolt and liberation." (Stewart is also in top form in "Personal Shopper.")
'Palm Springs' (2020)
The "Groundhog Day"-style time loop comedy gets an update and rom-com twist with Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti as a pair of wedding guests stuck reliving the same day, over and over -- but together, falling in and out of something resembling love while for everyone around them it's déjà vu. Samberg and Milioti shine, and the supporting cast is filled out with valuable players (including J.K. Simmons and June Squibb). The director Max Barbakow and the writer Andy Siara work out plenty of clever variations on the premise while gingerly tiptoeing into unexpectedly serious waters. Our critic called it "wildly funny" and "admirably inventive." (For more of Samberg in rom-com mode, try "Celeste and Jesse Forever.")
'Only Lovers Left Alive' (2014)
Plenty of authors and filmmakers have explored the day-to-day logistics of living one's life as a vampire, but perhaps only Jim Jarmusch could've looked at the undead and marveled at how much more time they'd have to read great books, watch wonderful movies and listen to cool albums. In his film "Only Lovers Left Alive," the chic bloodsuckers Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston find this elegant existence erupted by her wild-child sister (a potent Mia Wasikowska). But mostly, it's a vibe, a mood, a breezy hangout movie that also spills gallons of blood.

Tech Elite Bankroll Mystery Plan to Construct City From Scratch: [National Desk]

Full text: A mysterious company has spent $ 800 million in an effort to buy thousands of acres of San Francisco Bay Area land. The people behind the deals are said to be a who's who of the tech industry.
In 2017, Michael Moritz, the billionaire venture capitalist, sent a note to a potential investor about what he described as an unusual opportunity: a chance to invest in the creation of a new California city.
The site was in a corner of the San Francisco Bay Area where land was cheap. Mr. Moritz and others had dreams of transforming tens of thousands of acres into a bustling metropolis that, according to the pitch, could generate thousands of jobs and be as walkable as Paris or the West Village in New York.
He painted a kind of urban blank slate where everything from design to construction methods and new forms of governance could be rethought. And it would all be a short distance from San Francisco and Silicon Valley. "Let me know if this tickles your fancy," he said in the note, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times.
Since then, a company called Flannery Associates has been buying large plots of land in a largely agricultural region 60 miles northeast of San Francisco. The company, which has little information public about its operations, has committed more than $ 800 million to secure thousands of acres of farmland, court documents show. One parcel after another, Flannery made offers to every landowner for miles, paying several times the market rate, whether the land had been listed for sale or not.
The purchases by a company that no one in the area had heard of and whose business was a mystery have become the subject of heavy speculation and developing news stories, rattling landowners, local supervisors, the nearby Air Force base and members of Congress. Was Disney buying it for a new theme park? Could the purchases be linked to China? A deepwater port?
Flannery is the brainchild of Jan Sramek, 36, a former Goldman Sachs trader who has quietly courted some of the tech industry's biggest names as investors, according to the pitch and people familiar with the matter. The company's ambitions expand on the 2017 pitch: Take an arid patch of brown hills cut by a two-lane highway between suburbs and rural land, and convert into it into a community with tens of thousands of residents, clean energy, public transportation and dense urban life.
The company's investors, whose identities have not been previously reported, are a who's who of Silicon Valley, according to three people who were not authorized to speak publicly about the plans.
They include Mr. Moritz; Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn co-founder, venture capitalist and Democratic donor; Marc Andreessen and Chris Dixon, investors at the Andreessen Horowitz venture capital firm; Patrick and John Collison, the sibling co-founders of the payments company Stripe; Laurene Powell Jobs, founder of the Emerson Collective; and Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, entrepreneurs turned investors. Andreessen Horowitz is also a backer. It was unclear how much each had invested.
Brian Brokaw, a representative for the investor group, said in a statement that the group was made up of "Californians who believe that Solano County's and California's best days are ahead." He said the group planned to start working with Solano County residents and elected officials, as well as with Travis Air Force Base, next week.
In California, housing has long been an intractable problem, and Silicon Valley's moguls have long been frustrated with the Bay Area's real estate shortage, and the difficulty of building in California generally, as their work forces have exploded. Companies like Google have clashed with cities like Palo Alto and Mountain View over expanding their headquarters, while their executives have funded pro-development politicians and the "Yes in my backyard" activists who have pushed for looser development and zoning laws in hopes of making it easier to build faster and taller.
The practical need for more space has at times morphed into lofty visions of building entire cities from scratch. Several years ago, Y Combinator, the start-up incubator, announced an initiative with dreams of turning empty land into a new economy and society. Years before that, Peter Thiel, the PayPal co-founder and billionaire Facebook investor, invested in the Seasteading Institute, an attempt to build a new society on lily pad-like structures in the law-and-tax-free open ocean.
But while these ideas have garnered lots of attention and curiosity -- lauded in some corners for vision and derided in others for hubris -- they have been little more than talk.
As Flannery began seeking property, it bought so much land, so fast, that it spooked locals who had no idea who the buyer was or the plans it had in mind. Catherine Moy, the mayor of Fairfield, Calif., started posting about the project on Facebook several years ago after she got a call from a farmer about some mystery buyer making offers throughout the county. In an interview, Ms. Moy said she had gone to the county assessor's office and found that Flannery had purchased tens of thousands of acres.
John Garamendi, a Democrat who along with Mike Thompson, another Democrat, represents the surrounding region in Congress, said he had been trying to figure out the company's identity for four years.
"I couldn't find out anything," he said.
On Friday, he said that had suddenly changed. This week representatives for Flannery reached out to him and other elected officials requesting meetings about their plans. That meeting is now being scheduled, he said.
"This is their first effort, ever, to talk to any of the local representatives, myself included," he said.
The land that Flannery has been purchasing is not zoned for residential use, and even in his 2017 pitch, Mr. Moritz acknowledged that rezoning could "clearly be challenging" -- a nod to California's notoriously difficult and litigious development process.
To pull off the project, the company will almost certainly have to use the state's initiative system to get Solano County residents to vote on it. The hope is that voters will be enticed by promises of thousands of local jobs, increased tax revenue and investments in infrastructure like parks, a performing arts center, shopping, dining and a trade school.
The financial gains could be huge, Mr. Moritz said in the 2017 pitch. He estimated the return could be many times the initial investment just from the rezoning, and far more if and when they started building.
"If the plans materialize anywhere close to what is being contemplated, this should be a spectacular investment," Mr. Moritz wrote.
The Bay Area is among the country's most expensive regions, even after rent and home prices fell after the pandemic. Economists and housing experts have for decades blamed a longstanding housing shortage and California's inability to build enough to meet demand.
Mr. Moritz nodded to this in the email to the investor, arguing that "this effort should relieve some of the Silicon Valley pressures we all feel -- rising home prices, homelessness, congestion etc." He added that his group had secured some 1,400 acres for less than $ 5,000 per acre. The price per acre has since escalated, and the company's most recent purchases have neared $ 20,000 per acre, according to court documents and people familiar with the matter.
The purchases burst into public view this spring when lawyers for Flannery filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court, accusing landowners of colluding to inflate prices.
The group focused on Jepson Prairie and Montezuma Hills, an agricultural patch of eastern Solano County between the cities of Fairfield and Rio Vista, according to the lawsuit. This area is mostly unpopulated and covered with ranches, windmills and power lines.
In November 2018, the company sent offers to "most landowners in this area," the lawsuit said, and included incentives such as allowing sellers to retain income from wind turbines, as well as stay on the properties rent-free under long-term lease-back agreements. Over the five years, the company purchased some 140 properties from 400 owners, the lawsuit said.
This month, a lawyer representing landowners jointly filed a motion to dismiss the case. In July, three landowners said they had reached a potential settlement with Flannery. Other owners could not be reached for comment this week, or had declined to do so.
As the offers continued and prices escalated, landowners in Solano County started buzzing about who was buying so much land for so much money.
"They would come with an offer of four and five times over the market at the time," Ms. Moy said. "They were deals that they couldn't pass up."
Flannery's offers were creating multimillionaires across the county, but no one seemed to know what the mysterious company intended to do with land that now amounted to a large chunk of the entire county.
That changed last week, when residents started receiving texts and emails with a poll gauging their opinions on a number of questions. One asked them to rate the favorability of several names including "Joe Biden," "Donald Trump" and "Flannery Associates." Another question began with a description of a possible ballot initiative for a project that "would include a new city with tens of thousands of new homes, a large solar energy farm, orchards with over a million new trees, and over 10,000 acres of new parks and open space."
Ms. Moy cited poor infrastructure, including the two-lane highway bisecting the region that she said was already clogged by super-commuters driving to the edges of the Bay Area and beyond. The area is also prone to regular droughts and is at high risk for wildfires.
"It seems very pie in the sky," she said.

The site was in a corner of the San Francisco Bay Area where land was cheap. Moritz and others had dreams of transforming tens of thousands of acres into a bustling metropolis that, according to the pitch, could generate thousands of jobs and be as walkable as Paris or the West Village in New York.
He painted a kind of urban blank slate where everything from design to construction methods and new forms of governance could be rethought. And it would all be a short distance from San Francisco and Silicon Valley. “Let me know if this tickles your fancy,” he said in the note, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times.
Since then, a company called Flannery Associates has been buying large plots of land in a largely agricultural region 60 miles northeast of San Francisco. The company, which has little information public about its operations, has committed more than $800 million to secure thousands of acres of farmland, court documents show. One parcel after another, Flannery made offers to every landowner for miles, paying several times the market rate, whether the land had been listed for sale or not.
The purchases by a company that no one in the area had heard of and whose business was a mystery have become the subject of heavy speculation and developing news stories, rattling landowners, local supervisors, the nearby Air Force base and members of Congress. Was Disney buying it for a new theme park? Could the purchases be linked to China? A deep-water port?
Flannery is the brainchild of Jan Sramek, 36, a former Goldman Sachs trader who has quietly courted some of the tech industry’s biggest names as investors, according to the pitch and people familiar with the matter. The company’s ambitions expand on the 2017 pitch: Take an arid patch of brown hills cut by a two-lane highway between suburbs and rural land, and convert it into a community with tens of thousands of residents, clean energy, public transportation and dense urban life.
The company’s investors, whose identities have not been previously reported, are a who’s who of Silicon Valley, according to three people who were not authorized to speak publicly about the plans. They include Moritz; Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn co-founder, venture capitalist and Democratic donor; Marc Andreessen and Chris Dixon, investors at the Andreessen Horowitz venture capital firm; Patrick and John Collison, the sibling co-founders of payments company Stripe; Laurene Powell Jobs, founder of the Emerson Collective; and Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, entrepreneurs-turned-investors. Andreessen Horowitz is also a backer. It was unclear how much each had invested.
Brian Brokaw, a representative for the investor group, said in a statement that the group was made up of “Californians who believe that Solano County’s and California’s best days are ahead.” He said the group planned to start working with Solano County residents and elected officials, as well as with Travis Air Force Base, next week.
In California, housing has long been an intractable problem, and Silicon Valley’s moguls have long been frustrated with the Bay Area’s real estate shortage, and the difficulty of building in California generally, as their workforces have exploded. Companies like Google have clashed with cities like Palo Alto and Mountain View over expanding their headquarters, while their executives have funded pro-development politicians and the “Yes in my backyard” activists who have pushed for looser development and zoning laws in hopes of making it easier to build faster and taller.
The practical need for more space has at times morphed into lofty visions of building entire cities from scratch. Several years ago, Y Combinator, a startup incubator, announced an initiative with dreams of turning empty land into a new economy and society. Years before that, Peter Thiel, the PayPal co-founder and billionaire Facebook investor, invested in the Seasteading Institute, an attempt to build a new society on lily padlike structures in the law-and-tax free open ocean.
But while these ideas have garnered lots of attention and curiosity — lauded in some corners for vision and derided in others for hubris — they have been little more than talk.
As Flannery began seeking property, it bought so much land, so fast, that it spooked locals who had no idea who the buyer was or the plans it had in mind. Catherine Moy, mayor of Fairfield, California, started posting about the project on Facebook several years ago after she got a call from a farmer about some mystery buyer making offers throughout the county. In an interview, Moy said she had gone to the county assessor’s office and found that Flannery had purchased tens of thousands of acres.
Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., who along with Mike Thompson, another Democrat, represents the surrounding region in Congress, said he had been trying to figure out the company’s identity for four years.
“I couldn’t find out anything,” he said.
On Friday, he said that had suddenly changed. This week, representatives for Flannery reached out to him and other elected officials requesting meetings about their plans. That meeting is now being scheduled, he said.
“This is their first effort, ever, to talk to any of the local representatives, myself included,” he said.
The land that Flannery has been purchasing is not zoned for residential use, and even in his 2017 pitch, Moritz acknowledged that rezoning could “clearly be challenging” — a nod to California’s notoriously difficult and litigious development process.
To pull off the project, the company will almost certainly have to use the state’s initiative system to get Solano County residents to vote on it. The hope is that voters will be enticed by promises of thousands of local jobs; increased tax revenue; and investments in infrastructure like parks, a performing arts center, shopping, dining and a trade school.
The financial gains could be huge, Moritz said in the 2017 pitch. He estimated the return could be many times the initial investment just from the rezoning, and far more if and when they started building.
“If the plans materialize anywhere close to what is being contemplated, this should be a spectacular investment,” Moritz wrote.
The Bay Area is among the country’s most expensive regions, even after rent and home prices fell after the pandemic. Economists and housing experts have for decades blamed a long-standing housing shortage and California’s inability to build enough to meet demand.
Moritz nodded to this in the email to the investor, arguing “this effort should relieve some of the Silicon Valley pressures we all feel — rising home prices, homelessness, congestion etc.” He added that his group had secured some 1,400 acres for less than $5,000 per acre. The price per acre has since escalated, and the company’s most recent purchases have neared $20,000 per acre, according to court documents and people familiar with the matter.
The purchases burst into public view this spring, when lawyers for Flannery filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court, accusing landowners of colluding to inflate prices.
The group focused on Jepson Prairie and Montezuma Hills, an agricultural patch of eastern Solano County between the cities of Fairfield and Rio Vista, according to the lawsuit. This area is mostly unpopulated and covered with ranches, windmills and power lines.
In November 2018, the company sent offers to “most landowners in this area,” the lawsuit said, and included incentives such as allowing sellers to retain income from wind turbines, as well as stay on the properties rent-free under long-term lease-back agreements. Over the five years, the company purchased some 140 properties from 400 owners, the lawsuit said.
This month, a lawyer representing landowners jointly filed a motion to dismiss the case. In July, three landowners said they had reached a potential settlement with Flannery. Other owners could not be reached for comment this week or had declined to do so.
As the offers continued and prices escalated, landowners in Solano County started buzzing about who was buying so much land for so much money.
“They would come with an offer of four and five times over the market at the time,” Moy said. “They were deals that they couldn’t pass up.”
Flannery’s offers were creating multimillionaires across the county, but no one seemed to know what the mysterious company intended to do with land that now amounted to a large chunk of the entire county.
That changed last week, when residents started receiving texts and emails with a poll gauging their opinions on a number of questions. One asked them to rate the favorability of several names including “Joe Biden,” “Donald Trump” and “Flannery Associates.” Another question began with a description of a possible ballot initiative for a project that “would include a new city with tens of thousands of new homes, a large solar energy farm, orchards with over a million new trees, and over 10,000 acres of new parks and open space.”
Moy cited poor infrastructure, including the two-lane highway bisecting the region that she said was already clogged by super-commuters driving to the edges of the Bay Area and beyond. The area is also prone to regular droughts and is at high risk for wildfires.
“It seems very pie in the sky,” she said.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As Republican presidential candidates traded fire at their first debate, they mostly left their party's dominant front-runner unscathed.
One thing was clear when former President Donald J. Trump decided to skip the first debate of the 2024 Republican primary race: There would be a vacuum to fill.
But it was not Mr. Trump's chief rival in the polls, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, who emerged at the epicenter of the first Trump-free showdown on Wednesday, but instead the political newcomer Vivek Ramaswamy, whose unlikely rise has revealed the remarkable degree to which the former president has remade the party.
Mr. DeSantis had stumbled heading into the debate and was widely seen as in need of a stabilizing performance. He sought it by largely avoiding the scrum and sticking closely to the core case he makes on the stump, hoping to gain incremental ground in front of a national audience.
All eight candidates mostly jostled for position among themselves, and few targeted the front-runner who is set to surrender on Thursday after his fourth criminal indictment.
Here are seven takeaways.
It was the Ramaswamy show.
Six months ago, the idea that Mr. Ramaswamy, a 38-year-old entrepreneur, would be standing center stage at a Republican presidential debate would have seemed unimaginable.
And yet there he was, leaning into that fact with a line echoing one used famously by Barack Obama, asking, "Who the heck is this skinny guy with a funny last name?"
That skinny guy quickly became a punching bag for rivals, led by former Vice President Mike Pence, who invoked his experience to say that it wasn't time for a "rookie" who needed "on-the-job training." Former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey recalled the Obama line, quipping, "I'm afraid we're dealing with the same type of amateur."
But Mr. Ramaswamy smiled his way through the night, delighting in the attention as he staked out positions that might be unpopular among his competitors -- cutting funding for Ukraine's war effort (he mocked the country's president as "their pope"), and promising to pre-emptively pardon Mr. Trump -- but that resonate with the Republican base.
He hewed closely to Mr. Trump not just on substance but also on style. He stirred controversy to soak up screen time, and lobbed some of the evening's most strikingly personal slights: accusing Mr. Christie of auditioning for an MSNBC contract, Nikki Haley of having her eye on lucrative private-sector jobs and declaring -- to some boos -- that he was the only candidate not bought and paid for by special interests.
The Harvard-educated Mr. Ramaswamy came off at times as slick -- Mr. Christie dismissed him as "a guy who sounds like ChatGPT" -- but he was the one everyone else was talking about, a victory in itself.
DeSantis avoided attacks -- and ended up on the periphery.
Before the debate, Mr. DeSantis's aides had predicted that he would be the center of attacks. So much for that.
Rivals mostly ignored him, despite his status as the polling leader on the stage. It was a surprising turn of events that allowed Mr. DeSantis to make his own points without interruption or interrogation.
But it often relegated him to the sidelines. He spoke for two minutes less than Mr. Pence, only the fourth most speaking time of the eight candidates -- hardly the expected outcome without Mr. Trump.
In fact, the moment when Mr. DeSantis most exerted his authority came against Fox News's moderators, when he successfully steamrollered an attempt to have candidates raise their hands over whether they believed in human-caused climate change.
It felt like something of a fleeting alpha moment for a candidate in need of one.
But it was his hesitancy at another hand-raising question that captured one of the central conundrums of his candidacy: how to position himself versus Mr. Trump. When the moderators asked who would support Mr. Trump even if he were convicted in his criminal cases, Mr. DeSantis appeared to pause as each of the four candidates to his left, one by one, raised their hands before he did.
He did cite his biography in ways some advisers have wanted, unfurling a rare personal anecdote about seeing "the sonograms of all three of my kids" as he explained why he had signed a six-week abortion ban in Florida. But some core DeSantis lines were conspicuously absent: He did not talk about Disney or invoke his war on "woke."
Policy clashes showed G.O.P. divides.
More than any other issue, the question of America's role in Ukraine divided the candidates and presented two divergent visions for the Republican Party.
On one side stood the Reaganite interventionists, Ms. Haley and Mr. Pence. They argued for an America that should stand for freedom and against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.
On the other side stood Mr. DeSantis and Mr. Ramaswamy, who questioned whether supporting Ukraine was in America's national interest. Mr. Ramaswamy was unequivocal: America should no longer support Ukraine.
Mr. DeSantis left himself more wiggle room, leaving open sending more U.S. aid to Ukraine, but saying European countries needed to chip in more.
Democrats watching the debate -- including President Biden -- immediately seized on the Republican answers on climate change. When the candidates were asked if they believed human behavior was causing climate change, most seemed to want nothing to do with the question.
Only two were unequivocal: Mr. Ramaswamy, who called climate change a "hoax," and Ms. Haley, who said climate change was "real." Mr. DeSantis rejected a request by the moderators for a show of hands, saying: "We are not schoolchildren. Let's have the debate."
On abortion, the main debate was over whether it should be banned federally or at the state level. Mr. Pence and Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, who had a quiet night, argued for a national 15-week ban. Ms. Haley argued that a national ban was politically impractical. Mr. DeSantis indicated the issue should be left to the states.
Pence came out punching.
Mr. Pence made the most of every moment, crowbarring his way into almost every exchange, regardless of whether his name had been mentioned. He was so surprisingly aggressive that Bret Baier, one of the moderators, repeatedly urged him to stick to his allotted time.
Mr. Pence staked out the most anti-abortion position, arguing for a 15-week national ban and chiding his opponents who ducked the question -- suggesting they were acting out of political expediency rather than morality. "Consensus is the opposite of leadership," he told Ms. Haley. More than once, he cited his faith, which he has leaned on as he competes with Mr. Scott for evangelical voters.
But Mr. Pence saved his sharpest attacks for Mr. Ramaswamy. His disdain for the young entrepreneur recalled the visceral contempt Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota displayed for the cocky young mayor of South Bend, Ind., Pete Buttigieg, during the 2020 Democratic primary debates.
"I was a House conservative leader before it was cool," Mr. Pence said at one point.
But running as the experienced hand has been a tough sell in Republican primaries in recent years.
Haley positioned herself as the pragmatist.
There is little evidence in the Trumpian Republican Party that a moderate voice can succeed in presidential primaries. But during the debate, Ms. Haley seemed determined to try to do just that.
Instead of tacking right, Ms. Haley offered the closest thing to a general-election argument that any candidate delivered, highlighting herself as the only woman present.
"If you want something said, ask a man; if you want something done, ask a woman," she said -- a canned rendition of a Margaret Thatcher line, but one that landed.
At another point, Ms. Haley, a former United Nations ambassador under Mr. Trump, turned some of her fire on her own party about the country's national debt.
"The truth isn't that Biden did this to us, our Republicans did this to us, too," Ms. Haley said.
Her most aggressive moments came during an intense back-and-forth with Mr. Ramaswamy about Ukraine aid. She came charging at him: "You have no foreign policy experience, and it shows."
Fox News panned out to show the crowd cheering.
Boos underscored Christie's challenge.
On a crowded, chaotic debate stage -- which has often been Mr. Christie's best format -- he did not stand out as he has in the past.
Running for president a second time, he generally accomplished what he set out to do: Argue that Mr. Trump, whom he once supported, has engaged in conduct unfit for a president.
The problem for Mr. Christie was that he was booed lustily by the crowd nearly every time he leveled those criticisms. And his attacks came less frequently than many political watchers had anticipated. He let some opportunities to swing at Mr. Trump go by, especially in the first hour.
Mr. Ramaswamy also got the last word in a contentious exchange, reminding the Republican primary audience that Mr. Christie had embraced Mr. Obama during hurricane recovery efforts in New Jersey in 2012. That hug has angered Republican voters ever since.
When, in the second hour, Mr. Christie found a groove against Mr. Trump, the audience repeatedly drowned him out, a fact that Mr. Trump's social media site, Truth Social, took note of with an alert to users.
It all underscored the difficulty of Mr. Christie's task.
Trump avoided the debate, and meaningful attacks.
All eight Republicans onstage had to sign a pledge that they would support the party's eventual nominee -- even if it ends up being the man who skipped the debate and in doing so refused to make such a promise himself.
Throughout the night, Mr. Trump was something of a spectral presence -- not there, yet omnipresent.
While Mr. Christie and former Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas criticized him from the wings of the stage, no one fully took advantage of the front-runner's absence.
"I'm incredibly proud of the record of the Trump-Pence administration," Mr. Pence said at one point. Mr. Ramaswamy called Mr. Trump the greatest president this century.
Most candidates stood with Mr. Pence for his actions on Jan. 6, 2021, when he stood up to Mr. Trump's pressure to overturn the 2020 election. But few leaned into the topic. "We've answered this so many times," Mr. DeSantis protested, before eventually relenting. "Mike did his duty; I've got no beef with him."
It all amounted to a relatively warm embrace for the candidate running laps around them in polls, and an evening that seemed unlikely to upset the status quo in a race that Mr. Trump has dominated.

Full text: Giannis Antetokounmpo carried around a small, black portable fan, which looked minuscule as it whirred in his 12-inch-wide hands. He was trying to counteract the hot sun at a hillside mansion as he watched his youngest brother, Alex Antetokounmpo, pose for photos near a basketball hoop overlooking Los Angeles for an ad campaign.
"Alex, the eyes," Giannis said. "Eyes of the tiger right there, and then you mix it in with a smile."
Giannis turned and grinned at a group of about a dozen people watching. He has been coaching Alex for most of his life. When Giannis began his N.B.A. career with the Milwaukee Bucks at 18, he soon brought his family out of poverty in Greece to live with him. Alex was 12 years old.
"Sometimes I think I get annoying to him," Giannis, 28, said later, though Alex, 21, shows no signs that that might be true. Giannis added: "He could be doing idiotic stuff, stupid stuff, but he's going through a path that I'm really proud of him."
As Giannis ascended to N.B.A. superstardom -- he's won the Most Valuable Player Award twice and is the best player on a championship team -- he strove to bring his family along for his journey. Three of his four brothers have played professionally in the United States.
But over the past three years, he has brought them along for what he hopes can be a more lasting endeavor: taking ownership of their money and his future. A few months ago, Antetokounmpo launched Ante, Inc. to house the brothers' projects and investments. It's about Giannis's life beyond basketball, though basketball still matters to him -- a lot. In a few weeks, he will be eligible for a three-year extension worth about $ 173 million, but he doesn't plan to sign one just yet.
"The real question's not going to be this year -- numbers-wise it doesn't make sense," Antetokounmpo said. "But next year, next summer it would make more sense for both parties. Even then, I don't know."
He added: "I would not be the best version of myself if I don't know that everybody's on the same page, everybody's going for a championship, everybody's going to sacrifice time away from their family like I do. And if I don't feel that, I'm not signing."
This approach and an increased focus on business investments with his brothers are part of Antetokounmpo's evolution as he has begun to understand his own ambitions and goals more deeply.
"From 2020 to 2023, people think I've taken a large jump on the basketball court, but I think I've taken 10X jump off the court," he said.
'I gave everything.'
It started in the spring of 2020 when the world shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic. It wasn't clear what would happen to players' salaries or endorsement deals with the season in flux. He began to think of ways to diversify his sources of income.
"We were sitting in the house. OK, now what?" Antetokounmpo said. "Basketball is taken away, what do I have?" He downloaded a stock trading app and started investing on his own for the first time. He began to reach out to successful people from other industries for advice and mentorship.
It was an eventful year for him, which may have contributed to his interest in growing his income. His oldest child, Liam, had been born that February, and he had won his second M.V.P. Award, for the 2019-20 season, which the Bucks finished by losing in the Eastern Conference semifinals at the N.B.A.'s quarantined campus at Disney World.
A few months later, Antetokounmpo signed a five-year, $ 228 million extension with the Bucks. But something was not right. He felt numb, and did not know why. He told the Bucks that he did not want to play basketball anymore.
He had felt that way before. During his rookie year, he missed his family so much that he had insisted that the Bucks figure out a way to get them to Milwaukee, even threatening to go back to Greece if the team would not do it. He and his brothers had shared beds growing up. When Antetokounmpo left Greece for the N.B.A. draft in 2013, he said his father, Charles, told him: "No matter where you go in this world, doesn't matter, don't worry about that, I'll find you. I love you, my son. Go have a great season."
"And I remember my mom was crying," Giannis said. "I left. And then when I came here it wasn't the same. I was in the hotel. It was the first time I felt lonely in my life."
Alex said the siblings are "pretty much each other's best friends."
When Giannis felt down during the 2020-21 season, he was reassured when he told his older brother Thanasis about his doubts. By then, Thanasis was playing for the Bucks, too, and said that if Giannis was not happy he would leave with him.
"I would have walked away in 2020," Giannis said. "I care about joy and happiness. I care about my kids."
The Bucks recommended he speak to a sports psychologist, so Antetokounmpo tried it. Doing so helped him find ways to cope with the stress and pressure he felt. He rediscovered joy in playing basketball, and the Bucks won a championship that season.
"I think it's the best feeling that I've felt so far in basketball," he said.
He wants it again.
The Bucks lost in the first round of last season's playoffs, winning only one game against the Miami Heat as Giannis worked through injuries.
Milwaukee fired its coach, Mike Budenholzer, and hired Adrian Griffin, who had been an assistant coach for the Toronto Raptors. That change, Antetokounmpo said, is part of why he is unsure if he'll sign an extension.
"You've got to see the dynamics," he said. "How the coach is going to be, how we're going to be together. At the end of the day, I feel like all my teammates know and the organization knows that I want to win a championship. As long as we're on the same page with that and you show me and we go together to win a championship, I'm all for it. The moment I feel like, oh, yeah, we're trying to rebuild --"
He paused briefly before continuing.
"There will never be hard feelings with the Milwaukee Bucks," he said. "I believe that we've had 10 unbelievable years, and there's no doubt I gave everything for the city of Milwaukee. Everything. Every single night, even when I'm hurt. I am a Milwaukee Buck. I bleed green. I know this.
"This is my team, and it's going to forever be my team. I don't forget people that were there for me and allowed me to be great and to showcase who I am to the world and gave me the platform. But we have to win another one."
He is halfway to his goal of playing 20 N.B.A. seasons, and he said he would like to spend them with one team, the way Dirk Nowitzki, Kobe Bryant and Tim Duncan did.
"But at the end of the day, being a winner, it's over that goal," he said. "Winning a championship comes first. I don't want to be 20 years on the same team and don't win another championship."
He didn't mention any motivation for winning another championship outside of his competitive fire. But the cultural relevance that comes with winning can also elevate his growing off-court profile.
'We came from nothing.'
Giannis couldn't help but launch into a sales pitch as he sat in the living room of the home where he and Alex were doing the photo shoot. He was hyping a pain-relieving balm made by a company called Flexpower, which the Antetokounmpo brothers partially own. He has always considered himself to be a great salesman, back to when he was a child trying to help his parents sell sunglasses on the street in Athens.
During the photo shoot, Giannis flitted around like a proud mother hen, beaming at Alex. Working with the company was Alex's idea.
"I knew you when you were a baby!" Giannis said, holding his hands out as if rocking a baby.
Later, Giannis pondered when it was that he started thinking of Alex as an adult.
"Might be today," he said.
Four of the brothers are listed as co-founders on the Ante, Inc. website, but Giannis is the chairman. They have different roles, by virtue of their personalities. Alex describes Thanasis, 31, as very driven and bold in his style. Kostas, 25, has a quieter personality, but Alex said he excels at brainstorming.
Giannis involved his brothers in discussions about his new Nike contract, which he said he negotiated himself this summer. One of his earliest investments was in the Milwaukee Brewers, in 2021. The brothers have invested in a candy company, a nutritional company and a golf team co-owned by Venus and Serena Williams and Serena's husband, Alexis Ohanian. They have a production company in the works, like so many other N.B.A. players do.
This year, Giannis became a co-owner of some funds with Calamos Investments, whose chief executive, John Koudounis, is of Greek descent. The joint venture donates 10 percent of its profits to financial literacy organizations.
"He spent a lot of time talking about how he wishes that he had known about investing earlier," said Jessica Fernandez, Calamos's chief marketing officer. Antetokounmpo doesn't manage the portfolios, but he does pepper those who do with questions about why and how they choose certain stocks.
Earlier this year, the Antetokounmpo brothers joined the ownership group of Major League Soccer's Nashville SC.
"We came from nothing," Antetokounmpo said. "And sitting in the owners' suite with the other owners and enjoy the game, cheering for our team. Our team. Not just a team -- our team. It's insane."
Soccer was their first love; their father, who died in 2017, briefly played professionally. Their foundation, the Charles Antetokounmpo Family Foundation, seeks to help disadvantaged people in Greece, the United States and Nigeria, where their parents grew up.
'Protect the family.'
The idea that someone with Giannis's salary would worry about money might strain credulity, but he is thrifty -- cheap, he'll admit.
"I need my kids to spend my money," he said, smiling.
He said he wants six children, and is almost halfway there. He and his fiancée, Mariah Riddlesprigger, have two sons, Liam and Maverick, and Riddlesprigger is pregnant with their third child, a girl.
Antetokounmpo gets concerned when his children are pulled into the spotlight with him. In the United States, his fame is perhaps not as overwhelming as it would be were he playing in a bigger city. But in Greece things are different.
"The way LeBron James is or Michael Jordan is for the States, the same way I am for Greece," he said. "Maybe larger."
He has noticed people filming his children in their stroller and at a birthday party. He wants his children to be able to decide whether they want to live lives in the public. On social media, he typically covers their faces.
When he thinks about growing his wealth, he is thinking about his children's futures, too.
The brothers try to make business decisions as a group, often on a messaging thread titled "Antetokounbros" (which is also the name of a store they have in Athens; they're opening one in Milwaukee soon). They save personal texts for a different thread titled "F.O.E.," which stands for family over everything.
He said he has felt taken advantage of in the past by some of the people hired to handle his life, money or off-court interests, and was confident that will never happen with his family.
"I see it with my teammates, some of my teammates," Antetokounmpo said. "'Oh, my cousin did this. My mom did this.' You see it. It's public. Moms arguing with their sons, suing one another for property that doesn't belong to them. You see it every day."
He added: "The way we were raised in Greece and the things that we went through every single day to provide for our family, all those moments brought us close. They knew that at all costs I would protect the family, take care of my brothers. And I did."

Award in 2019, below right, he was joined by his brothers, from left, Kostas, Thanasis and Alex. He will soon eligible for a three-year extension worth about $ 173 million.

Eager for Finale, 'Bachelorette' Fans in Washington Were Left Brokenhearted: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Fans of the reality show were not happy after a local ABC affiliate showed a preseason game between the Washington Commanders and Baltimore Ravens instead.
Fans of "The Bachelorette" reality television show who live in the Washington, D.C., area were unable to watch the finale of the show's 20th season on Monday night. It turns out their ABC affiliate showed an N.F.L. game instead -- and a preseason one at that.
If you know any "Bachelorette" fans, you can probably guess how the Washington-area ones felt about this particular programming call.
"I was pretty frustrated," Pegah Moradi, 25, who lives in Arlington, Va., said by phone early Tuesday.
"It's more important for sports to be live, obviously, than it is for a prerecorded reality show finale," said Ms. Moradi, a graduate student. "But at the same time, it's difficult when something that you're accustomed to viewing at a certain time is just not there."
The practice of cutting one must-watch TV broadcast for another, more common in the past, has become rare in the streaming era. If something is important enough to broadcast live these days, networks and streaming platforms can usually find a way to do that.
But on Monday, the "Bachelorette" finale was shelved in the D.C. area by ABC's local affiliate in favor of a football game between the Washington Commanders and the Baltimore Ravens. (The Commanders won, 29-28, after kicking a field goal in the game's waning seconds.)
"It might be because the two football teams are regional favorites that people are obsessed with," said Julia Swift, a professor in the Division of Communication and Creative Media at Champlain College in Burlington, Vt. "But people are also obsessed with 'The Bachelorette."'
N.F.L. policy mandates that games that air nationally -- on cable networks like ESPN or on streaming services such as Amazon Prime -- are broadcast on free, over-the-air television in the local markets of the participating teams. This is so fans can see their hometown teams play, even if they don't have cable or a subscription to a streaming service, Brian McCarthy, an N.F.L. spokesman said in a statement.
The network, in this case ESPN, arranges with a local affiliate of its choice to broadcast the game in the teams' markets. Neither ESPN nor the local ABC affiliate, WJLA, provided comment on the matter.
ABC, the majority owner of ESPN, did not respond to questions about why the game was aired in lieu of the "Bachelorette" finale, but a spokesman said that the episode would be available Tuesday on streaming platforms such as Hulu and that fans could sign in with their cable provider to stream it online.
The "Bachelorette" finale was available on Charge!, an over-the-air broadcasting network owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group. Charge! is free and does not require a paid subscription. But some fans, including Ms. Moradi, had never heard of it and could not figure out how to watch.
Professor Swift said that it would have made more sense to air the episode on a streaming platform that belongs to ABC or Disney, the network's corporate parent. (WJLA, the ABC affiliate that showed the game instead of the finale, is owned by Sinclair.)
The latest season of "The Bachelorette," a spinoff of "The Bachelor" and "Bachelor in Paradise," stars Charity Lawson, a real-life child-and-family therapist from Georgia who is looking for a life partner. Ms. Lawson, 27, began the season with 25 suitors; by the finale, she was down to three.
The ABC affiliate that cut the finale likely did so after calculating that more people would watch the football game, said Amanda Lotz, a professor of media studies at Queensland University of Technology in Australia who has studied the U.S. television industry.
Whatever the reason, the decision illustrates how the federal policies governing American television today were designed decades ago to promote "local sovereignty" by giving local affiliates discretion over what to air, said Professor Lotz, the author of "We Now Disrupt This Broadcast: How Cable Transformed Television and the Internet Revolutionized It All."
The concept of "local sovereignty" may sound anachronistic in the streaming era, she added, "but these were policies that were designed to protect local community differences so that they wouldn't be overrun by the creation of a national culture."
One way to read Monday's scheduling call would be as a kind of karmic victory for football fans, who were famously denied the ending of a nail biter of a game between the Jets and the Oakland Raiders on Nov. 17, 1968. With 50 seconds left, the television broadcast cut out abruptly to make way for "Heidi," a made-for-TV children's movie about a Swiss orphan.
As for "The Bachelorette," Ms. Moradi said she understood that the Commanders and the Ravens are both in her television market and have local fan bases. "But a preseason N.F.L. game versus the finale of a major franchise TV show is not a very difficult decision to make in terms of what to broadcast," she said.
After her viewing plans were scrambled on Monday, Ms. Moradi inadvertently saw a spoiler for the show as she searched for how to watch. At this point, she said, she wonders if watching the finale will even be worth her time.
"Everyone I know who was watching it will have already seen it, for the most part, so I'll just kind of be in the dark for 24 hours," she said. "I won't get to join in on this rare experience: watching live TV at the same time as everyone else."

In an Unusual Step, Hollywood Studios Disclose Their Offer on Day 113 of Writers' Strike: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The public disclosure of the Aug. 11 proposal was an unusual step and suggested an attempt to go around union leadership and appeal to rank-and-file members.
In an apparent attempt to break a labor stalemate that has helped bring nearly all of Hollywood production to a standstill, the major entertainment studios took the unusual step on Tuesday night of publicly releasing details of their most recent proposal to the union that represents 11,500 striking television and movie writers.
The studios are confronting significant decisions about whether to push the release of big-budget films like "Dune: Part Two" into the next year, and whether the network television lineup for the 2023-24 season can be salvaged or reduced to reality shows and reruns.
Shortly before the release of the proposal, several chief executives at the major Hollywood companies, including David Zaslav of Warner Bros. Discovery and Robert A. Iger of Disney, met with officials at the Writers Guild of America, the writers' union, to discuss the latest proposal, according to a statement by the union's negotiating committee.
By releasing the proposal, the companies are essentially going around the guild's negotiating committee and appealing to rank-and-file members -- betting that their proposal will look good enough for members to pressure their leaders to make a deal.
The writers' union said the studios' offer "failed to sufficiently protect writers from the existential threats that caused us to strike in the first place." The union described the public release of the companies' proposal as a "bet that we will turn on each other."
The writers have been on strike for 113 days. The studios and writers resumed negotiations on Aug. 11 for the first time since early May. Since then, there has been optimism within the entertainment industry that the labor disputes might be on a path to resolution.
But the public disclosure of the proposal by the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of the studios, suggests that negotiations may have again reached an impasse. The studios and writers' union had generally agreed to adhere to a media blackout while at the bargaining table, and the studio alliance has only occasionally released public statements before the guild.
"We have come to the table with an offer that meets the priority concerns the writers have expressed," Carol Lombardini, the lead negotiator for the alliance, said in a statement that accompanied the details of the latest proposal. "We are deeply committed to ending the strike and are hopeful that the Writers Guild of America will work toward the same resolution."
Hollywood has been effectively shut down since tens of thousands of Hollywood actors joined striking screenwriters on picket lines on July 14. Both the writers and actors have called this moment "existential," arguing that the streaming era has deteriorated their working conditions as well as their compensation levels.
The studios said that their latest proposal offered the "highest wage increase" to writers in more than three decades, as well as an increase in residuals (a type of royalty) that has been a major point of contention. The studios also said that they had offered "landmark protections" against artificial intelligence, and that they vowed to offer some degree of streaming viewership data to the guild, information that had previously been held under lock and key.
In the statement, the studios said they were "committed to reaching an equitable agreement to return the industry to what it does best: creating the TV shows and movies that inspire and entertain audiences worldwide."

Looking Past Debate, G.O.P. Candidates Are Spending Big on Ads: [National Desk]

Full text: Many of the party's presidential candidates have spent heavily as they try to introduce themselves to voters. Ads for Donald Trump, meanwhile, look ahead to a matchup with President Biden.
Americans who don't live in early presidential nominating states -- that is to say, most Americans -- might not be aware of the advertising wars already underway in the 2024 campaign. For months, Republican candidates have been on the airwaves, plugging away at themes we are likely to see more of during the party's high-stakes first debate on Wednesday.
This year, they face an unusual challenge: Former President Donald J. Trump has effectively taken on the role of an incumbent. The rest of the candidates have spent tens of millions of dollars to introduce themselves to primary voters, stake out policy positions and chart a course to the general election -- only to be overshadowed by Mr. Trump.
"I think of advertising as spitting out Ping-Pong balls," said Ken Goldstein, a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco who has researched political advertising. Mr. Trump's influence, he said, means that other candidates' messages often do not reach voters: "There's this big, huge wind blowing those Ping-Pongs back in their face."
The gamble for the challengers is that the wind will shift -- or go away entirely.
"If your opponent is winning 57 percent of the vote and you have 2, there is zero percent chance you are making that difference up with advertising," said Lynn Vavreck, a professor of political science at the University of California, Los Angeles. Even in a typical election year, Dr. Vavreck said, the persuasive effects of campaign television advertisements are small, and fade fast.
"That doesn't mean everybody polling under 10 percent should stop," Dr. Vavreck said. "They need to be seen as a candidate who's taking it seriously. That includes advertising."
Here's a look at some of the themes and strategies emerging in the campaign advertising for the more than a dozen Republican candidates.
How are the candidates dealing with Trump?
Many of the Republican candidates, particularly the lower-polling ones, do not address the former president at all in their ads. Others take indirect shots at him.
Former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and his allies are the loudest exception.
In a series of acerbic ads, a super PAC supporting Mr. Christie has ripped Mr. Trump over his indictments, his electoral losses and his impeachments. In an ad that ran nationally after Mr. Christie qualified for the debate on Wednesday, the narrator goads Mr. Trump to join him onstage: "Are you a chicken, or just a loser?"
Ads on New Hampshire and Iowa stations by the main super PAC backing Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida have criticized Mr. Trump elliptically -- for instance, asking why the former president is attacking Republican governors rather than focusing his attention on Democrats and President Biden. (Mr. Trump, one ad concludes, "is all about himself.") In another ad, a man covers his Trump bumper sticker with a DeSantis one.
Other groups not connected to any candidate have spent millions opposing Mr. Trump.
Win It Back, a super PAC that shares leadership with the Club for Growth, a conservative anti-tax group, has bought $ 5.6 million in ads, according to an analysis by AdImpact, a media-tracking firm. The ads including lengthy broadcast spots in Iowa and South Carolina that feature voters who once supported Mr. Trump but are now looking for a new candidate.
A political action committee supporting Mr. Trump, in the meantime, has turned its attention to the general election, with a 60-second ad attacking Mr. Biden.
Who is spending the most?
The main super PAC supporting Mr. DeSantis has spent $ 17 million buying television ads, while MAGA Inc, a PAC supporting Mr. Trump, has spent $ 21.4 million, according to the AdImpact analysis.
But that doesn't come close to the $ 46.2 million spent in support of Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, between his campaign and a super PAC backing him. That figure includes a huge outlay on ads planned for the weeks after Wednesday's debate.
A PAC supporting Nikki Haley has spent $ 8.4 million on ads -- about the same amount spent on ads for Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota, between his largely self-funded campaign and a super PAC supporting him. Ms. Haley's ads include broadcast spots in New Hampshire and Iowa that draw on her experience as ambassador to the United Nations, and a clip describing her as the "surprise rock star" of the Trump administration.
Perry Johnson, a businessman who has lent his own campaign $ 8.4 million, has spent $ 1.9 million on ads. One ad that ran in Illinois features him walking determinedly through a blizzard of computer-generated charts and mathematical equations, representing his love of statistics and quality standards.
Many of his online ads have included a plea for donations to get him over the threshold of 40,000 donors required to participate in Wednesday's debate. (The Republican National Committee said on Tuesday that he had not qualified.)
Pleas for donors to contribute just $ 1 -- a clear attempt at meeting the debate threshold -- also featured heavily in digital ads by SOS America PAC, which is supporting Mayor Francis X. Suarez of Miami. The super PAC has spent $ 1.7 million on ads, the AdImpact analysis shows.
What themes are emerging?
Border security, China, a touch of Ukraine, inflation, cleaning up Washington. And, of course, the culture wars.
Mr. DeSantis's super PAC has amplified his resistance to coronavirus lockdown orders, and lauds him for "pushing back against the woke left." In a video clip in one of the ads, he says: "If you're coming for the rights of parents, I'm standing in your way." The group's ads have also gone after Disney and Bud Light.
Another ad from the group aims to appeal to anti-abortion voters, quoting Mr. Trump relaying criticism that the six-week abortion ban Mr. DeSantis signed in Florida was "too harsh."
The super PAC supporting Ms. Haley ran a digital ad in May that highlighted her "pro-life" voting record in South Carolina, and criticized Mr. Biden for encouraging protests after Roe v. Wade was overturned. "We need a president who unites Americans," she says, "even on the toughest subjects."
Perhaps no candidate has made more of his opposition to abortion than former Vice President Mike Pence, and his ads have addressed this head-on. One of his longer ads focuses entirely on his anti-abortion record.
Both Ms. Haley and Mr. Pence have used the phrase "the ash heap of history" in stump speeches that wind up in their ads -- Ms. Haley in reference to the future of "Communist China," and Mr. Pence in reference to the overturning of Roe.
What's the visual style of the ads?
So far, most of the ads have been pretty "cut-and-paste," as Mr. Goldstein put it. Inspiring personal stories, a few grim shots of Mr. Biden, uplifting music, a few wives offering endorsements of their husbands, adoring crowds, American flags.
The entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy (total ad outlay: $ 334,000, plus $ 240,000 more from a supporting super PAC) has made a slightly different presentation. Unlike other candidates' campaign ads, his spots do not rely on dramatic voice-overs, but feature him in a room, speaking directly at the camera.
The super PAC supporting Mr. Scott tried another approach to introduce the candidate: ads featuring prospective voters speaking to the camera about the senator, as if speaking to their neighbor: "Have you seen him work a crowd?" "Did you see Tim Scott on 'The View'?" "He will crush Joe Biden."
Who has the best Ronald Reagan cameo?
Does a 40-year-old endorsement count? An ad for former Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas -- seeking $ 1 donations to help him reach the debate stage -- consists almost entirely of a short clip of former President Ronald Reagan, sitting at his desk in the Oval Office and addressing the camera.
"If you believe in the values I believe in, there's a man you should get to know," Mr. Reagan says. "His name is Asa Hutchinson."
Mr. Reagan had nominated Mr. Hutchinson to serve as the United States attorney for the Western District of Arkansas. The clip appears to be from an endorsement for Mr. Hutchinson in the 1986 Senate race. (He lost to Dale Bumpers, an incumbent Democrat.)
Mr. Ramaswamy invokes Mr. Reagan in a digital ad, saying the former president "led us out of our national malaise" carried over from the 1970s. Mr. Ramaswamy pledges to lead America out of its latest "national identity crisis."

Young Activists Taking On Climate Change Fight: [National Desk]

Full text: As Kaliko Teruya was coming home from her hula lesson on August 8, her father called. The apartment in Lahaina was gone, he said, and he was running for his life.
He was trying to escape the deadliest American wildfire in more than a century, an inferno in Hawaii fueled by powerful winds from a faraway hurricane and barely hindered by the state's weak defenses against natural disasters.
Her father survived. But for Kaliko, 13, the destruction of the past week has reinforced her commitment to a cause that is coming to define her generation.
"The fire was made so much worse due to climate change," she said. "How many more natural disasters have to happen before grown-ups realize the urgency?"
Like a growing number of young people, Kaliko is engaged in efforts to raise awareness about global warming and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, last year she and 13 other young people, age 9 to 18, sued their home state, Hawaii, over its use of fossil fuels.
With active lawsuits in five states, TikTok videos that mix humor and outrage, and marches in the streets, it's a movement that is seeking to shape policy, sway elections and shift a narrative that its proponents say too often emphasizes climate catastrophes instead of the need to make the planet healthier and cleaner.
Young climate activists in the United States have not yet had the same impact of their counterparts in Europe, where Greta Thunberg has galvanized a generation. But during a summer of record heat, choking wildfire smoke and now a hurricane bearing down on Los Angeles, American teenagers and 20-somethings concerned about the planet are increasingly being taken seriously.
"We see what's happening with climate change, and how it affects everything else," said Elise Joshi, 21, the executive director of Gen-Z for Change, an organization she joined while she was in college. "We're experiencing a mix of anger and fear, and we're finally channeling it into hope into the form of collective action."
The youth vote's mounting frustration with the Biden administration's climate agenda is a wild card factor in next year's presidential race. They are particularly livid that President Biden, who pledged "no more drilling on federal lands, period," during his campaign, has failed to make good on that promise.
Young people are helping organize a climate march in New York next month, during the United Nations General Assembly. And their force is being felt even in deep-red states like Montana, where a judge on Monday handed the movement its biggest victory to date, ruling in favor of 16 young people who had sued the state over its support for the fossil fuel industry.
In that case, a lengthy fight resulted in a surprise victory that means, at least for now, that the state must consider potential climate damage when approving energy projects.
"The fact that kids are taking this action is incredible," said Badge Busse, 15, one of the plaintiffs in the Montana case. "But it's sad that it had to come to us. We're the last resort."
That mix of pride and exasperation is not uncommon among young climate activists. Many are energized by what they see as the fight of their lives, but also resentful that adults haven't seriously confronted a problem that has been well understood for decades now.
"Do you think I really want to be on a stand saying, like, 'I don't have a future,"' said Mesina DiGrazia-Roberts, 16, another of the plaintiffs in the Hawaii case, who lives on Oahu. "As a 16-year-old who just wants to live my life and hang out with my friends and eat good food, I don't want to be doing that. And yet I am, because I care about this world. I care about the Earth and care about my family. I care about my future children."
In the Hawaii case, the youths have sued the state's Department of Transportation over its use of fossil fuels, arguing that it violates their "right to a clean and healthful environment," which is enshrined in the state Constitution. The state filed two motions to dismiss the case, but this month a judge set a trial date for next year.
A nonprofit legal organization called Our Children's Trust is behind the Montana and Hawaii cases, as well as active litigation in three other states. A similar case it brought in federal court, Juliana v. United States, was thrown out by an appeals court in 2020, days before it was set to go to trial. But in June, a different judge ruled the case could once again proceed toward trial.
Vic Barrett, 24 and a resident of the Bronx, is one of the plaintiffs in Juliana v. United States and got interested in climate change a decade ago after learning about it in an after-school program not long after Hurricane Sandy inflicted widespread damage across the Northeast.
"I started understanding how low income and Black and brown people in New York were disproportionately impacted by Hurricane Sandy," he said. "People like me are at the forefront of the climate crisis."
Climate change is a growing political priority for young people. It was one of the top issues among a third of young voters in the 2020 presidential election, according to Tufts University.
But while the Biden administration has passed sweeping laws, including the Inflation Reduction Act, designed to speed the development of clean energy, it has also angered young environmental activists by approving new fossil fuel projects.
"It's absurd that while the Biden administration this year is celebrating the one-year anniversary of the I.R.A., it is actively opposing Juliana and working to expand drilling on federal lands," said Zanagee Artis, 23, who quit a job at Goldman Sachs to spend more time working at Zero Hour, a climate nonprofit he co-founded while in high school.
Mr. Artis, who helped organize a youth climate march in 2018, is still sending people into the streets. Zero Hour is now recruiting people to attend the March to End Fossil Fuels, which will take place in New York on Sep. 17.
Chief among the frustrations of Mr. Artis and his cohort was the administration's decision to approve Willow, a huge drilling project in Alaska. Early this year, TikTok erupted with calls for the White House to deny approvals for the project, thrusting the issue into the mainstream and giving thousands of young people a common cause. Creators juxtaposed images of Mr. Biden with collapsing glaciers, recorded tearful selfie videos and mashed up songs from "Encanto" with slide shows of cute animals.
Their efforts failed. In March, the administration approved Willow, which is set to produce crude oil for another 30 years. But the #StopWillow campaign, which garnered more than 500 million views on TikTok, showed that impassioned youth could shape the national debate.
"It was still a win," said Ms. Joshi, who posted the first #StopWillow video on TikTok. "Millions of people were talking about why a project in remote Alaska was important to our health," she said. "That base building is going to be used for future campaigns."
Across the movement, there is an effort to combat "climate nihilism," the fatalistic acceptance that nothing can stop runaway global warming. That sentiment, captured in the phrase "OK Doomer," contributes to the slow pace of progress, they maintain.
Spinning the fear and frustration that many young people experience into positive action is a chief aim of Wanjiku Gatheru, 24, who founded an organization called Black Girl Environmentalist that is working to get more young people of color involved in the movement.
"Fear doesn't motivate people toward sustainable action," Ms. Gatheru said. "Providing solutions in the midst of discussion of a problem helps get people engaged."
Enthusiasm for the climate movement is spreading in surprising ways. A group of young techno optimists who shun doomerism have embraced the label of "Decarb Bros." And among Republicans, millennials and members of Gen Z are far more likely than their elders to believe that humans are warming the planet and support efforts to reduce emissions, according to the Pew Research Center. Overall, about 62 percent of young voters support phasing out fossil fuels entirely, according to Pew.
On Maui, Kaliko and her family were trying to recover from the second natural disaster in five years. In 2018, flash flooding from Hurricane Olivia destroyed their home on the northern tip of the island. Now, the fire.
"We really need adults to wake up," she said. "If we don't fix this now, there's not going to be a future."

As Kaliko Teruya was coming home from her hula lesson on Aug. 8, her father called. The apartment in Lahaina, on the Hawaiian island of Maui, was gone, he said, and he was running for his life.
He was trying to escape the deadliest American wildfire in more than a century, an inferno fueled by powerful winds from a faraway hurricane and barely hindered by the state’s weak defenses against natural disasters.
Her father survived. But for Kaliko, 13, the destruction of the past week has reinforced her commitment to a cause that is coming to define her generation.
“The fire was made so much worse due to climate change,” she said. “How many more natural disasters have to happen before grown-ups realize the urgency?”
Like a growing number of young people, Kaliko is engaged in efforts to raise awareness about global warming and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, last year she and 13 other young people, ages 9-18, sued their home state, Hawaii, over its use of fossil fuels.
With active lawsuits in five states, TikTok videos that mix humor and outrage, and marches in the streets, it’s a movement that is seeking to shape policy, sway elections and shift a narrative that its proponents say too often emphasizes climate catastrophes instead of the need to make the planet healthier and cleaner.
Young climate activists in the United States have not yet had the same impact of their counterparts in Europe, where Greta Thunberg has galvanized a generation. But during a summer of record heat, choking wildfire smoke and now a hurricane bearing down on Los Angeles, American teenagers and 20-somethings concerned about the planet are increasingly being taken seriously.
“We see what’s happening with climate change, and how it affects everything else,” said Elise Joshi, 21, executive director of Gen-Z for Change, an organization she joined while she was in college. “We’re experiencing a mix of anger and fear, and we’re finally channeling it into hope into the form of collective action.”

The Elites He Now Targets Gave DeSantis a Leg Up: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Over the years, Mr. DeSantis embraced and exploited his Ivy League credentials. Now he is reframing his experiences at Yale and Harvard to wage a vengeful political war.
Early last year, Gov. Ron DeSantis nestled into his chair onstage in Naples, Fla., to explain to an audience of the would-be conservative elite his journey through the reigning liberal one they hoped to destroy. His host was Larry P. Arnn, the president of Hillsdale College, a small Christian school in southern Michigan that has become an academic hub of the Trump-era right. His subject was Yale University, where Mr. DeSantis was educated and where, as he tells it, he first met the enemy.
"I'm a public school kid," Mr. DeSantis told the audience, unspooling a story that he has shared in recent years with aides, friendly interviewers, donors, voters and readers of his memoir, "The Courage to Be Free." "My mom was a nurse, my dad worked for a TV ratings company, installing the metering devices back then. And I show up in jean shorts and a T-shirt." The outfit "did not go over well with the Andover and Groton kids" -- sometimes it is Andover and Groton, sometimes it is Andover and Exeter, sometimes all three -- who mocked his lack of polish.
Worse than Yale's snobbery was its politics: College was "the first time that I saw unadulterated leftism," he told the Republican Jewish Coalition this March. "We're basically being told the Soviet Union was the victim in the Cold War." Teachers and students alike "rejected God, and they hated our country," he assured the audience in Naples. "When I get people that submit résumés," he said, "quite frankly, if I got one from Yale I would be negatively disposed."
Then there are the parts of the story he doesn't tell: How his new baseball teammates at Yale -- mostly fellow athletic recruits from the South and West who likewise viewed themselves as Yale outsiders -- were among those who teased him about his clothes, and how he would nevertheless adopt their insular culture as his own. How he joined one of Yale's storied "secret societies," those breeding grounds of future senators and presidents, but left other members with the impression that he would have preferred to be tapped by a more prestigious one. How he shared with friends his dream of going to Harvard Law School -- not law school, Harvard Law School -- and successfully applied there, stacking one elite credential neatly onto another, and co-founded a tutoring firm that touted "the only LSAT prep courses designed exclusively by Harvard Law School graduates." How his Yale connections helped him out-raise rivals as a first-time candidate for Congress, and how he featured his Ivy credentials -- "a political scarlet letter as far as a G.O.P. primary went," Mr. DeSantis likes to say -- on his campaign websites, sometimes down to the precise degree of honors earned. And how that C.V. helped sell him to an Ivy-obsessed President Donald J. Trump, whose 2018 endorsement helped propel Mr. DeSantis to the governor's office in Florida, where his Yale baseball jersey is displayed prominently on the wall next to his desk.
Mr. DeSantis, 44, is not the first Republican politician of his generation to rail against his own Ivy League degrees while milking them for access and campaign cash. But now, as he seeks the Republican presidential nomination, he is molding his entire campaign and political persona around a vengeful war against what he calls the country's "ruling class": an incompetent, unaccountable elite of bureaucrats, journalists, educators and other supposed "experts" whose pernicious and unearned authority the governor has vowed to vanquish.
For Mr. DeSantis and his allies, the culture wars are the central struggle of American public life, and schools are the most important battleground where they will be fought. "Education is our sword," Mr. DeSantis's then education commissioner, Richard Corcoran, explained to a Hillsdale audience in 2021. And Mr. DeSantis is the man to wield it -- a self-made striver who was "given nothing," as he told the audience attending his campaign kickoff in Iowa in May. "These elites are not enacting an agenda to represent us. They're imposing their agenda on us, via the federal government, via corporate America and via our own education system." Even as he struggles to displace Mr. Trump as the Republican Party's pre-eminent figure -- he has spent heavily since May without denting the former president's polling lead, and is under extraordinary pressure to make his mark at the first Republican debate on Wednesday, which Mr. Trump plans to skip -- Mr. DeSantis has become captain of a new conservative vanguard, positioning it to influence American politics for years to come.
Yet his emergence as his party's chief culture warrior was anything but preordained. Genuinely embittered by his experiences at elite institutions, he also astutely grasped how they could be useful to him as he climbed the political ladder, according to dozens of friends and classmates from college and law school, as well as former aides and associates. For much of his political career, including his early years as Florida governor, he was neither closely identified with education policy nor deeply engaged in the debates over race and gender identity that have come to engulf American politics. It took the Covid epidemic to awaken Mr. DeSantis to the political potency of classrooms and fully mobilize him against what he now calls the "bureaucratic 'expert' class." Now, pursuing the presidency, Mr. DeSantis has fully weaponized his resentments, offering voters a revisionist history of his own encounters with the ruling class to buttress his arguments for razing it.
But Mr. DeSantis and his ideological allies -- among them a group of conservative intellectuals clustered around Hillsdale and the California-based Claremont Institute who acquired new prominence during the Trump administration -- are not aiming to abolish the ruling class. Instead, emboldened by the broader Covid-era backlash over school closures and diversity programs, they hope to replace it with a distinctly conservative one, trained in schools recaptured from liberals and reshaped by "classical" principles -- a more traditionalist, Christian-inflected approach to education. "School choice may allow a small number of highly informed and committed parents to insulate their children" from liberal ideas about social justice, the authors of a recent paper from the Manhattan Institute argued, "but it will make little difference to the level of indoctrination in the American school-age population."
In a written response to questions for this article, a DeSantis spokesman, Bryan Griffin, described The New York Times's reporting as a "hit piece likely manufactured and seeded by political opponents designed to smear Ron DeSantis ahead of the debate," and defended the governor's record. "In the Covid era, the world went mad with radical gender ideology and began pushing it harder than ever into school curriculum," Mr. Griffin said. "DeSantis stepped up to the moment and stopped the indoctrination despite the left and the media's best efforts to cover for it."
To uproot what he considers liberal political activism from public schools and universities, Mr. DeSantis has stripped power from teachers and administrators and transferred it to himself and his appointees. But even as he calls to dismantle "woke" orthodoxy, he has sought to impose another, with a sweeping ban on the teaching of "identity politics" or "systemic racism" in required classes at Florida's public colleges and universities and new civics training for high school teachers that plays down the role of slavery in early American history. Under the banner of "parental rights," DeSantis-backed policies have given conservative Floridians a kind of veto power over books and curriculums favored by their more liberal neighbors, even in politically mixed or predominantly left-leaning Florida counties.
"Where local communities create conservative culture and conservative school districts, DeSantis doesn't touch them," said David Jolly, a former Republican congressman from Florida who served alongside Mr. DeSantis in Congress. "Where communities confront his conservative ideologies, the state steps in."
Earlier this year, in what amounted to a proof of concept, the governor seized control of New College of Florida, a left-leaning public liberal arts school in Sarasota. He appointed a conservative majority to the board of trustees; the college's new overseers then fired the school's leadership, installed Mr. Corcoran as president and announced plans to turn New College into a Florida version of Hillsdale. "The goal of the university is not free inquiry," Christopher Rufo, a conservative activist and one of the new trustees, said during a recent appearance in California. Instead, he argued, conservatives need to deploy state power to retake public institutions wherever they can.
"The universities are not overly politicized. The universities are overly ideologized and insufficiently politicized," Mr. Rufo said. "We should repoliticize the universities and understand that education is at heart a political question."
'Hell Week,' Baseball and St. Elmo
Mr. DeSantis had never been to New England when he arrived at Yale in the late 1990s, an honor student and baseball standout from the middle-class suburban Gulf Coast city of Dunedin. He was far from the only public school graduate in Yale's freshman class, but he already carried a chip on his shoulder, caught between a powerful confidence in his own gifts -- his "superiority complex," as one classmate described it -- and his discomfort with Yale's more cosmopolitan milieu. He majored in history, taking classes in the culture and politics of the Founders, and closely studied the work of Gordon Wood, whose books emphasized the political radicalness of the American Revolution. He loved "A Few Good Men" and "Scent of a Woman," especially the rousing speech at the end, in which Al Pacino's character rails against the rich snobs tormenting a scholarship student at a New England prep school. Though Yale had a thriving conservative political scene, Mr. DeSantis shied away from it. He rarely talked about politics at all.
Instead, he found his tribe on the baseball team, where he was known to all as "D," the name he preferred to his given one. Like every other freshman player, he was hazed by his new teammates, and not just for his jean shorts. The baseball players segregated themselves from the rest of Yale and cultivated a hostility toward their peers, their latent status anxiety sharpened by a realization that some of their fellow students did not take them or their sport seriously. Some recalled being told by classmates, and even professors, that they did not belong at Yale. As athletes, they perceived themselves to be the school's true meritocrats, admitted on the strength of their own sweat and discipline. "We set ourselves up against the most privileged students at Yale, who, in truth, we did not actually know very well," Jonathan Levy, a baseball teammate who is now a professor at the University of Chicago, said in an email. "In hindsight, our mid-1990s admission to Yale was our opportunity to join this elite. Every member of the team was handed that same ticket."
As a senior, Mr. DeSantis was elected captain, which his closest Yale friends have sometimes presented as a testament to his leadership qualities. According to other former teammates, however, there were no other contenders: The team had few seniors that year, and Mr. DeSantis was a starting outfielder. His arrogance could startle. At a "captain's practice" that fall, the team's revered coach, John Stuper, delivered a brief pep talk to the freshmen. After he left, Mr. DeSantis told the team that their coach, a former major league pitcher, didn't know what he was doing. Through his spokesman, Mr. DeSantis denied making the remark. In an interview, Mr. Stuper, who described the governor as "like a son" to him, said: "I just can't imagine that happening. He had a lot of respect for me, still does, has asked me to campaign for him." Mr. Stuper added, "There's just no way that he would undermine my authority by doing that."
Along with many of his teammates, he joined Delta Kappa Epsilon, a fraternity composed largely of athletes, many from working-class backgrounds. "We all kind of bonded through our athletics, and through our fraternity," said Nick Sinatra, a Buffalo native and Yale friend who played football there. At Yale, D.K.E. was known as boorish even by fraternity standards, with a reputation for over-the-top hazing of pledges. When Mr. DeSantis was a senior, according to former brothers and pledges, a large group of pledges quit after one hazing episode turned violent. On another night, pledges were ordered to a frat house room, two of them recalled. After entering one at a time, each was blindfolded and ordered to drop his pants, with Mr. DeSantis, other brothers, and at least one female guest on hand to mock their genitalia. One of the pledges recalled that a blender was placed between his legs and abruptly turned on to scare him, splashing water on his groin.
During the fraternity's "hell week," pledges wore costumes smeared with rotten food and condiments. They might be ordered to simulate sex with one another or do outdoor calisthenics in the winter air. According to four former pledges and brothers, Mr. DeSantis required one pledge, for whom he served as "father," to wear a pair of baseball pants with the back and thighs cut out, exposing his buttocks and genitals.
Another D.K.E. brother, Scott Wagner, a friend of Mr. DeSantis who served on the governor's Florida transition team, said none of the pledges' costumes involved nudity. Reached by The Times, the former pledge, who asked not to be identified, confirmed that he was made to wear the revealing costume but declined to discuss the experience further. Today, some of the former brothers and pledges regard Mr. DeSantis's behavior as foreshadowing a comfort with power -- and with using it to bully others.
Mr. DeSantis denied these accounts through his spokesman, who called them "ridiculous assertions and completely false."
Mr. DeSantis also joined one of the school's secret societies, St. Elmo. The societies, though swathed in mystery and arcane symbolism, mostly functioned to introduce Yale seniors to classmates they might not know. His St. Elmo class was a diverse group that met weekly for a family-style dinner in a comfortable, run-down townhouse near campus. At meetings, the members took turns delivering their "bios," or life stories, in the living room, in speeches that could last hours. Mr. DeSantis often showed up in his baseball uniform; his own bio leaned heavily on baseball, his Florida roots and his journey to Yale. But when it came time for others to tell their stories, Mr. DeSantis tuned out, according to former St. Elmo members. He rolled his eyes as one member, Cristina Sosa Noriega, talked about growing up as a Hispanic public schoolgirl in San Antonio, Ms. Sosa Noriega and two other members recalled. "He seemed bored and disinterested," Ms. Sosa Noriega said. "It was like I wasn't worth listening to. I had the feeling that he assumed that I didn't deserve to be there." (Mr. DeSantis's spokesman denied that account and said it was "frankly absurd" to suggest that anyone would remember "such a detail from decades ago.")
In "The Courage to Be Free," Mr. DeSantis's Yale education is tidily repackaged as a prologue to his future battles with the ruling class. "In retrospect, Yale allowed me to see the future," he writes. "It just took me 20 years to realize it." Yet the book is curiously vague, identifying no particular exchanges or classes where he encountered the fervent anti-Americanism that, in his telling, defined his education there. His spokesman declined to identify any.
But other perspectives were easily available: According to Mr. Sinatra, Mr. DeSantis took Yale's most popular undergraduate class about the Cold War, taught by the historian John Lewis Gaddis, whose work blamed the Soviet Union for the conflict, not the United States. (The governor's spokesman said Mr. DeSantis "did not take issue with John Gaddis's class.") While the book paints turn-of-the-century Yale as cloyingly liberal, awash in Soviet flags and Che Guevara T-shirts, other classmates recall a left-leaning but generally apathetic campus of the pre-9/11 era, and a Che shirt worn by one particular roommate, with whom Mr. DeSantis seemed friendly enough.
After graduation, some of his baseball teammates "punched their Yale ticket," according to Dr. Levy, moving into banking, consulting or medicine. Others returned to their hometowns, starting careers that didn't necessarily require the credentials they had acquired. And some, Dr. Levy observed, "wanted it both ways, to have a Yale-charged life but to reject Yale elitism." He added: "I think this is what DeSantis is still doing, in the form of a political project -- trying to reach the elite pinnacle of the American political establishment while railing against that same establishment."
A Short Climb to the Elite
Mr. DeSantis began fashioning a deeper critique of the ruling class even as he quietly climbed its ranks, already telling others that he imagined himself as a future president. Harvard Law was little different from Yale, he writes in "The Courage to Be Free," with a stultifying careerism layered onto overtly liberal politics. The Harvard faculty of the early 2000s, Mr. DeSantis asserted, "was increasingly dominated by adherents of so-called critical legal studies" -- a left-wing school of argument that seemingly neutral laws can be racist or discriminatory. At the same time, he wrote, Harvard offered an "assembly-line style of education" aimed chiefly at preparing students for "a lucrative career in business or law." Mr. DeSantis instead joined the Navy, serving as a military prosecutor and combat adviser. Later, as the Tea Party movement arrived in Washington, he started writing his first book, about the Founders and President Barack Obama.
"Dreams From Our Founding Fathers" came out in fall 2011, a dense tract packed with quotes from Madison and Hamilton and casting Mr. Obama as a European-style socialist bent on deconstructing the republic they imagined. As anti-Obama polemicist, Mr. DeSantis treated slavery as a kind of constitutional sideshow -- an institution whose stubborn persistence in early America need not disturb a close adherence to the Founders' vision, since it was "doomed to fail" in a nation guided by their universal truths. Mr. DeSantis attributed Mr. Obama's purported radicalism to his education at Harvard Law, and to his years living in the Chicago neighborhood of Hyde Park, where the future president taught law at the University of Chicago. It was in these places -- "monolithically" far left, populated by the "credentialed elite" and isolated from the "broader political society" -- that Mr. Obama absorbed the progressive tradition, with its attachment to "a large administrative state" and "ostensibly nonpartisan 'solutions' devised by experts."
Though many classmates shared Mr. DeSantis's recollection of Harvard as heavily oriented toward corporate law careers, other aspects of his narrative do not hold up. Faculty battles over critical legal studies had unfolded vividly at Harvard Law in the 1970s and 1980s, but by the time Mr. DeSantis arrived a quarter-century later, the approach had reached a nadir. Harvard students of his era were more drawn to the discipline of law and economics, advanced by conservative legal scholars. (Mr. DeSantis's spokesman noted that, nonetheless, "there were critical legal studies being taught at the time.") In interviews, some of his conservative classmates recalled being reluctant to express their political views in class. But far more described Harvard as intellectually open and committed to ideological diversity. "The picture DeSantis gives is just not right -- it's kind of a cliché about Harvard, and it's simply not true," said Charles Fried, a longtime Harvard Law professor and a faculty sponsor of Harvard's chapter of the Federalist Society, the influential conservative legal organization. "He must have known it, because everyone knew it."
When Mr. DeSantis started at Harvard in 2002, the school had a conservative dean, Robert C. Clark, an early Federalist Society supporter whose appointment had been part of a deliberate effort to re-center the professoriate. A 2005 survey of The Harvard Law Review, published in the Federalist Society's flagship publication, The Harvard Journal of Law & Public Policy, found that staff members "identifying themselves as left-of-center did not comprise even a majority."
Mr. DeSantis's own foray into big-firm corporate law -- a stint as a litigator for the Miami-based Holland & Knight before he ran for Congress -- goes unmentioned in his memoir. So does his involvement in Harvard's Federalist Society chapter, where he served as a business manager for the journal, crossed paths with future judges and politicians and met Leonard Leo, the conservative power broker who years later would help him execute a right-wing takeover of Florida's Supreme Court. Indeed, Mr. DeSantis showed scant public trace of bitterness about his elite education in the years before his political career.
After leaving the Navy, he again put his elite educational bona fides forward, joining with two of his closest law school friends to found an Ivy-themed test-prep company, LSAT Freedom, headquartered at his home in Ponte Vedra Beach. In a series of brief YouTube seminars with his co-founders, Mr. DeSantis comes off as earnest and knowledgeable about the mechanisms of elite advancement. "If you're in a fourth-tier school, versus, like, a school that's maybe in the top 50," he observed, "then there's a world of difference in terms of your investment and the return on your investment."
His own credentials would yield a bounty when he finally entered politics. He was little-known to local Republican leaders and voters in the newly drawn congressional district he set out to win in early 2012, but he was a disciplined campaigner and proved a formidable fund-raiser. Supporters nicknamed him "the Résumé." Yale friends around the country -- baseball teammates, fraternity brothers, fellow secret-society members -- sent checks, helping drive a flood of out-of-state money. A Yale friend put him in touch with a political adviser to Mr. Trump, who praised him on Twitter as "very impressive." Law school classmates got him meetings with national Republican figures who went on to endorse his winning bid.
When Mr. DeSantis decided to run for governor a few years later, he had even more help from the Yale world, tapping an older, more conservative generation of alumni, such as the former financial executive Joseph J. Fogg III. "He came to my attention because he's a Yalie," Mr. Fogg told The Miami Herald. A few months before announcing his campaign, Mr. DeSantis traveled to Cambridge, Mass., to join a panel of Harvard alumni serving in Congress. While some Republican voters might take a dim view of Harvard, he told them, the school "opens a lot of doors" for aspiring politicians. To the networks of ultrarich conservative donors whose money could help advance him to the next rung, his elite résumé was part of the appeal. "I had a good story," he said, "an appealing biography to people that were looking to help young leaders."
The Outbreak
After being elected governor by a hair's breadth, Mr. DeSantis at first seemed mindful of the political center. He committed billions of dollars to protect the Everglades. Appearing at his alma mater Dunedin High School, he announced a proposal to raise teachers' minimum salaries. In the face of efforts by liberal students and activists to shut down conservative speakers on college campuses, Mr. DeSantis, like many other Republican officials in the pre-Covid era, urged Florida universities to adopt a version of the "Chicago principles" favoring academic free expression.
Building on the work of his Republican predecessors, he signed legislation creating a small voucher program for low-income students. Though school-choice advocates view the program as a pivotal early step toward taxpayer-funded vouchers in Florida, Mr. DeSantis resisted advisers who wanted him to move even more aggressively on choice in his first year, fearing it would crowd out other priorities, according to two former aides. (His spokesman said Mr. DeSantis "has always been a fervent supporter of expanding school choice, and it was one of his first-term campaign platforms.") When the Florida House speaker at the time proposed to him abolishing New College entirely, Mr. DeSantis recalled recently, he replied, "What is New College?"
Then came Covid. At first, Mr. DeSantis reluctantly heeded Trump administration health officials like Dr. Anthony S. Fauci. He imposed a state lockdown in April 2020; he sometimes appeared masked at public events. But amid shifting federal guidance and growing worry about the social and economic impacts of lockdowns, he began doing his own research. He consulted experts who departed from the emerging medical consensus around Covid restrictions, and he moved quickly to relax them. That summer, embracing data showing that children were at low risk for severe illness or death from Covid, Mr. DeSantis took perhaps his biggest gamble: His administration ordered all Florida schools to reopen for in-person instruction when the school year began.
He was widely attacked, even mocked, for his decisions -- criticism that would galvanize Mr. DeSantis, according to former aides, and cement his nascent suspicion of bureaucrats and supposed experts. Florida schools did not become superspreaders; research later showed that students in open schools around the country tended to lose less ground during the pandemic than students in closed schools. Mr. DeSantis doubled down. In early 2021, as conservative activists and outlets fanned suspicion of the new Covid vaccines, he effectively stopped promoting them -- a turn that contributed to overwhelmed Florida hospitals, public health experts later said, and thousands of deaths that the state's own former surgeon general would deem "preventable." But by then, the governor had already claimed victory over the experts. "The Covid-19 pandemic represented a test of elites in the U.S., from public-health experts to the corporate media," Mr. DeSantis wrote in The Wall Street Journal in March 2021. "Policymakers who bucked the elites and challenged the narrative have been proven right to do so."
The pandemic had also changed the political contours of education. In blue and purple states around the country, a swath of otherwise middle-of-the-road parents erupted against Democrats and teachers' unions over continued school closures. There was a rising backlash against mask mandates and the spread, in the wake of the George Floyd protests, of "anti-racist" and "equity" curriculums. Mr. Rufo, previously a little-known documentarian and activist, had introduced millions of people to the academic doctrine known as critical race theory, saying it had infiltrated public school classrooms and workplaces around the country. New groups quickly formed to channel this swell of parental anger into political action, notably in Florida, where three mothers, one with ties to the state Republican Party, formed a group called Moms for Liberty and quickly built it into a national force. After years of playing defense on schools, Republicans now had a fight that could simultaneously energize their base, win more independents and peel off skeptical Democrats -- defending "parental rights" against the left-wing teachers, administrators and diversity consultants they argued were indoctrinating their children.
For Mr. DeSantis, education officials represented yet another set of "experts" who were getting it wrong. "Ron bet big against the grain on one thing, which was reopening schools," said one former aide. "It paid off, and he was right. He learned that lesson at the same time that education became more political. And he cared more about education because Moms for Liberty suddenly existed."
Florida, already shifting rapidly to the right, would have a starring role in the country's new culture wars, and Mr. DeSantis was quick to grasp the political opportunity. In 2022, Florida lawmakers began drafting what its detractors would label the "Don't Say Gay" law. Though Mr. DeSantis is now indelibly linked to the legislation, at first, "I was not fully versed in the intricacies of the Parental Rights in Education bill," he recalled in his memoir. "Yet I saw the corporate media and the political left colluding to create and repeat a false narrative about the bill." For critics, the bill -- a complex piece of legislation banning classroom discussion or instruction about "sexual orientation or gender identity" in ways that were not "age appropriate or developmentally appropriate" -- seemed designed to force gay students and teachers into the closet. Mr. DeSantis and his aides were soon defending the bill vigorously; one claimed that anyone opposing the bill "is probably a groomer." The conflict thrust Mr. DeSantis to the culture war's front lines, and he would repeat the playbook over and over, with a blitz of hard-edge school and curriculum policies that outraged many liberals and endeared him to the grass-roots right.
At the Heart of a Movement
As he battled against critical race theory and bureaucratic elites, Mr. DeSantis became entwined with a rising movement of conservative academics and activists outside Florida.
Less known for technical policy advice than for sweeping polemics about the decay of American government and culture, Claremont scholars shared Mr. DeSantis's belief that "American freedom required a recovering of the Founding ideals," as Brian T. Kennedy, a former president of Claremont who remains a fellow there, put it. One of Claremont's founders, Dr. Arnn, had taken over Hillsdale in 2000 and transformed it into both a fund-raising juggernaut and a redoubt of Christian, classically oriented liberal arts education. The upset win of Mr. Trump, whose rough brand of populism echoed Claremont's more highbrow take on American decline, gave both institutions new prominence in Washington. His tumultuous defeat, in 2020, left the intellectuals and funders of Claremont and Hillsdale considering whether they ought to find a new horse to back.
Mr. DeSantis had cultivated them even before becoming governor. As a congressman, he sent Dr. Arnn a copy of "Dreams From Our Founding Fathers." "I read his book, and I went, 'Wow, this is pretty good,"' Dr. Arnn recalled last year. "This guy can actually walk and chew gum." Later, as Hillsdale looked to expand its network of classical charter schools, it found the DeSantis administration a willing partner. (Today, Florida has one of the largest concentrations of Hillsdale-affiliated charters in the country.) Mr. DeSantis was connected to Claremont in part through friends: Adam Laxalt, a Navy roommate and scion of a Nevada political dynasty, and Michael B. McClellan, a California lawyer, Yale classmate and former Claremont fellow. But the institute's core political critique -- that American constitutional ideals had been corrupted by the emergence of the so-called administrative state -- also resonated with Mr. DeSantis. Among the only modern-day intellectual influences he has acknowledged in his recent book and public appearances is Angelo Codevilla, the late Claremont scholar and author of a seminal 2010 essay attacking what he called the American ruling class.
Dr. Codevilla held that class was a matter of culture and ideology, not money. A foreign service officer turned academic, he was scathing about the ruling class's credentialism and faith in scientific consensus, and critiqued the role of schools in perpetuating the American elite. "Today's ruling class, from Boston to San Diego, was formed by an educational system that exposed them to the same ideas and gave them remarkably uniform guidance, as well as tastes and habits," he wrote. "These amount to a social canon of judgments about good and evil, complete with secular sacred history, sins (against minorities and the environment) and saints." Usefully, Dr. Codevilla's formulation placed traditionalist intellectuals and wealthy Middle American elites on the side of the common man. "An underpaid but well-connected blogger for The New York Times who graduated from Sarah Lawrence College and supports open borders would be considered part of the ruling class," David Azerrad, a Hillsdale professor, wrote in The American Spectator in 2017. "A millionaire used-car dealer in Omaha who 'clings to his guns and religion' and is proudly patriotic would not."
As Mr. DeSantis's profile rose amid the Covid battles, both Claremont and Hillsdale lavished him with attention and praise. In Naples last year, Dr. Arnn introduced Mr. DeSantis as "one of the most important people living." Claremont scholars describe Florida as a test bed for the new right, and at its annual gala in 2021, Claremont awarded Mr. DeSantis its statesmanship award. "Governor DeSantis is a product of elite education and yet, wonderfully, rejects its core premises," the institute's president, Ryan P. Williams, said by way of introduction, and he "wields the prestige that he got from that elite education on behalf of normal America -- a too-rare thing." Accepting the award, Mr. DeSantis approvingly cited Dr. Codevilla and called for battle against the ruling class. "He saw this probably before anybody," said Mr. DeSantis. "But he was right on the money."
Lecturing the Lecturers
As his preparations for the presidential campaign accelerated this year, so did Mr. DeSantis's crusade against the ruling class. In February, the governor and his wife, Casey, invited Mr. Williams, along with several other Claremont fellows and affiliates, to a private meeting at the Capitol in Tallahassee. The occasion was the opening of Claremont's new Florida outpost, under the aegis of Scott Yenor, a professor at Boise State University and a Claremont fellow, now the institute's new "senior director of state coalitions." "Protecting Americans from infringing woke ideology is important work," tweeted Ms. DeSantis, "and we are grateful Scott and the Claremont Institute picked Florida to continue their mission." Later that day, the Claremont crowd joined the governor and his top aides for cocktails and dinner. Over a glass of Macallan at the Governor's Mansion, he regaled them with the story of his takeover of New College the previous month and exchanged ideas about battling campus liberals.
The red-carpet welcome underscored Claremont's increasingly prominent role in Mr. DeSantis's policy apparatus. Earlier that month, Mr. DeSantis had invited another Claremont fellow to join his "round table" on the need to pass new laws against "legacy media defamation." (The setting was a mock television studio, with Mr. DeSantis playing the role of host.) A few weeks later, in advance of his expected presidential bid, Mr. DeSantis treated his top donors and fund-raisers to a Claremont-only panel at the Four Seasons in Palm Beach. (The purpose of the panel, according to planning emails obtained by The Times, was to "define the 'Regime' which illegitimately rules us" and lay out a strategy to "make states more autonomous from the woke regime by ridding themselves of leftist interests.") In March, Dr. Yenor joined Mr. DeSantis for yet another round table, this one focused on the evils of diversity, equity and inclusion programs in higher education.
Dr. Yenor was already a controversial figure. In a 2021 speech in Orlando, Fla., describing "the political and personal evils that flow from feminism," he had claimed that feminist "careerism" made women "more medicated, meddlesome and quarrelsome than women need to be." Calling modern universities "citadels of our gynecocracy," he argued that they should stop recruiting women to medical, law and trade schools and instead focus on recruiting more men. Boise State officials resisted calls to fire Dr. Yenor for his remarks, citing the principles of academic freedom and his First Amendment rights; though some students filed Title IX complaints, he was ultimately cleared.
On the same day he appeared with the governor in March, Dr. Yenor unveiled a report, "Florida Universities: From Woke to Professionalism," asserting that public colleges were "gripped by D.E.I. ideology" that threatened to "tear Florida apart." Though released by Claremont, the report was first edited by a top DeSantis aide, according to emails obtained by The Times. And though it drew little notice outside Florida, the report echoed Dr. Yenor's viral speech. The state should not only defund "D.E.I.-infused" programs and classes, he recommended, but ban the collection of "race-based data" entirely, in order to hobble federal investigations into discrimination at Florida institutions. The real victims of higher-education discrimination, Dr. Yenor wrote, were men: Florida should "order civil rights investigations of all university units in which women vastly outnumber men among the student body and/or faculty -- especially colleges of nursing and education -- for disparate impact" and root out "any anti-male elements of curriculum." (At New College, The Sarasota Herald-Tribune reported in August, DeSantis allies have boosted male enrollment in part by doling out a disproportionate share of the school's merit scholarships to a new crop of student-athlete applicants, though that group had lower-than-average grades and test scores.) Rather than defend academic free speech, Dr. Yenor advised, Mr. DeSantis and his appointees should adopt "a more ideological bent" to rein in administrators and teachers and cultivate love of country.
Two months later, the governor signed a law banning the state's public colleges and universities from spending money on diversity programs, setting off a now-familiar cycle of negative headlines and DeSantis counterattacks. Despite the coverage, however, only portions of the bill actually addressed D.E.I. administrators. Perhaps more consequentially, the legislation imposed a vague but expansive speech code on Florida public university campuses -- prohibiting required courses "based on theories that systemic racism, sexism, oppression and privilege are inherent in the institutions of the United States and were created to maintain social, political and economic inequities." (In an interview, Manny Diaz Jr., the state's current education commissioner, said that "conversations about theories and the debates about these theories" should take place only in higher-level elective courses. "Why am I talking about that in a math class? In a literature class?") In legal battles to defend Mr. DeSantis's higher-education agenda, lawyers for his administration, far from defending academic freedom, have argued that the concept does not even apply to public university professors: College curriculums and in-class instruction are merely "government speech," controllable by duly elected officials. The American Association of University Professors likened the state's position to "authoritarian control of education similar to what exists in North Korea, Iran, or Russia."
In April 2022, the state's Department of Education rejected dozens of math textbooks because, officials claimed, they "contained prohibited topics," including critical race theory. A Times review of about half the textbooks found little reference to race at all, let alone the more abstruse academic topic of critical race theory. In fact, only three of 125 state-appointed reviewers had found objectionable content, The Herald reported. Two had ties to Hillsdale -- a civics education specialist involved in the college's "1776 Curriculum," which emphasizes a patriotic, traditional view of the Founding, and a sophomore political science major who was secretary of the Hillsdale College Republicans.
Mr. Corcoran, then the education commissioner, also tapped Hillsdale to join a small group of outside institutions helping to revise the state's civics standards, another signature DeSantis initiative. Both Hillsdale and Claremont personnel feature disproportionately in a series of online teacher training courses subsequently created for the effort. (A Hillsdale spokeswoman said individuals involved in the training and in Florida's textbook reviews had acted in their "private capacity," not on behalf of the school.) In-person training last summer amounted to an indoctrination, according to some teachers who attended, into conservative views about constitutional "originalism" and the separation of church and state. Much as Mr. DeSantis had in his own writing, the training sessions sought to minimize the relevance of slavery to an understanding of the Founding: One slide stated that even those Founders "that held slaves did not defend the institution." (Mr. DeSantis's spokesman said it was "inane media propaganda" to suggest that the training slides minimized slavery or that the governor had ever done so.) Other slides criticized court rulings opposed by conservatives, such as a 1962 decision against school-sponsored prayer.
In a statement last year about the training, the Florida Education Department told The Herald that "every lesson we teach is based on history, not ideology or any form of indoctrination." But Mr. Corcoran was more direct while speaking at Hillsdale. Education, he said then, is "100 percent ideological."
Deepening Influence
Whatever the fate of his presidential campaign, Mr. DeSantis's influence over Florida schools seems likely to expand. Last summer, as he ramped up his re-election bid in Florida, he became the state's first governor to campaign in local school board races, endorsing a slate of 30 candidates -- many of them also backed by Moms for Liberty -- "committed to the student-first principles of the DeSantis Education Agenda." The normally sleepy, officially nonpartisan races became pitched ideological battles, awash in money. Most of his candidates won, placing new pro-DeSantis majorities in a half-dozen coastal boards previously controlled by more liberal members. Last spring, Republican lawmakers placed on next year's ballot an amendment to the state constitution that would make such elections formally partisan. Mr. DeSantis, like Republicans elsewhere in the country, supports such efforts, though they defy a long American tradition of nonpartisan public education governance.
One of the new Republican-majority boards is in Pinellas County, where Mr. DeSantis grew up and where he began his climb into the American elite. In January, Pinellas school district officials yanked Toni Morrison's classic novel "The Bluest Eye" from high schools after a parent complained about a two-page rape scene. (In a YouTube video, the parent, who herself taught at a private Christian school, described Pinellas schools as "Marxist indoctrination camps.") The officials cited new state guidelines, crafted with input from Moms for Liberty volunteers, to "err on the side of caution" when evaluating what books to make available to schoolchildren. Soon after, an administrator blocked one local elementary school from showing the Disney film "Ruby Bridges," about the 6-year-old Black girl who integrated New Orleans schools in the 1960s. The removal came after a different mother, who had already declined permission for her daughter to see the movie in class, demanded that no one else's children be allowed to see it.
Both decisions were later reversed -- months later, in the case of Ms. Morrison's novel. "Activists file blanket complaints against hundreds of books, and in many school districts, that triggers the books' automatic removal pending review. And very often, those reviews can take months to complete, effectively banning the book in the meanwhile," said Jeffrey Sachs, a scholar at Acadia University in Nova Scotia who studies academic speech policies. Mr. Diaz disputed that the new state policy was to blame for such delays. "I think the onus is on the district to make that process speedy," he said.
Elements of Mr. DeSantis's education policies have been blocked in court, and others remain under legal challenge as his presidential campaign unfolds. But in counties like Pinellas, his policies and rhetoric have already had what his critics believe is their intended effect. "Before the pandemic, I felt like what I call the 'swirl of Tallahassee' just lived up there," said Laura Hine, a Pinellas school board member who is not registered with either party and is among the board candidates Mr. DeSantis's operation has targeted for defeat in next year's elections. "The weaponization of political rhetoric around education, and the associated policies, have now reached our classroom teachers."
Two years ago, a Pinellas parent named Renee Chiea -- also warning of "Marxist indoctrination" in county schools -- filed a complaint against Brandt Robinson, a teacher at Dunedin High School. She objected to parts of the syllabus Mr. Robinson had distributed to his class on African-American history, which her son had briefly enrolled in. In a written complaint, Ms. Chiea argued that one book Mr. Robinson planned to assign, "Creating Black Americans: African-American History and Its Meanings, 1619 to the Present," by the Princeton historian Nell Irvin Painter, distorted history by painting America as "inherently racist" -- violating new state rules, passed earlier that year at Mr. DeSantis's urging, banning from classrooms any material that espoused the idea "that racism is embedded in American society and its legal systems." In an email to The Times, Ms. Chiea, an activist with the Pinellas chapter of Moms for Liberty, also argued that the book was based on "the same theories" as "The 1619 Project," a Times examination of the legacy of slavery, which Florida had also banned from classrooms.
A review panel ultimately rejected her complaint. "I don't stop my class and ask my white kids, 'Hey, how are you feeling?' What kind of teacher would do that?" Mr. Robinson said. "It's not my job to tell you what to think. It's to help you become a better thinker." People identifying themselves as Moms for Liberty activists began leaving comments on Mr. Robinson's TikTok account, where he posts daily videos about history. In January, someone reported Mr. Robinson for a TikTok mentioning that he had taught students in his Dunedin sociology class about the Black thinker W.E.B. Du Bois and the concept of "double consciousness" -- how racism forced Black Americans to always imagine how they might appear through white people's eyes.
According to Mr. Robinson, whoever reported him claimed that he was indoctrinating his students. "Some of the people who make these assertions are just grossly undereducated. In their minds, critical race theory is all kinds of things," he said.
Ms. Chiea said she felt that the school district had mishandled her own complaint against his course, and believed that Mr. Robinson was still trying to circumvent Florida's new rules. "I am positive he has not changed the content of what he teaches in his class," she said. "And until there is some honesty and transparency in that, it will remain under scrutiny by me."

Full text: The former N.F.L. player and inspiration for "The Blind Side" just launched a legal battle with the family he once considered his own. Two memoirs tell Oher's side of the story.
Michael Oher was a young man with a promising football career when Michael Lewis captured his story in "The Blind Side," a best-selling book that was made into an Oscar-winning movie starring Quinton Aaron and Sandra Bullock.
The character in that narrative -- a Black football player from a destitute background who was taken in by a white family and launched into Division I college football and then the N.F.L. -- has been frozen in amber since the book came out in 2006.
The real Oher, now 37, has had a more complicated trajectory. On Monday he announced that he is suing to formally end his legal relationship with the family that took him in, claiming he had been tricked into signing away his decision-making powers and rights to his own story.
Critics have noted that blockbuster renditions of Oher's story seem to charge past his interior life. "One thing mostly missing from the book is Mr. Oher's own voice," Janet Maslin wrote in her review of "The Blind Side." In his review of the screen adaptation, A.O. Scott described it as a "live-action, reality-based version of a Disney cartoon" in which "a wealthy, white Southern family adopts a poor Black teenager, cultivating his athletic gifts and providing him with the comfort and safety of a happy, loving home."
Oher offers his own view in two memoirs --"I Beat the Odds" and "When Your Back's Against the Wall" -- written with Don Yaeger. The setup is the same: The sport is football, the place is Memphis and the benefactors are Leigh Anne Tuohy and Sean Tuohy, who opened their home to Oher when he was a student at a local private school.
But, in these accounts, the ball is in Oher's hands.
"I was one of 12 kids," wrote Oher in his second book. "I don't remember anyone ever having a job and no one in my family graduated from high school before me. Just about every adult in my life was addicted to crack cocaine. I barely knew my father before he was killed. I was on my own from age 7, going back and forth from foster care to living on the street. I attended 11 schools in nine years."
Reading these memoirs back to back, you might pick up a few hints at the motivation behind his legal battle. You definitely see the evolution of Oher's stance on his relationship with Tuohys, which appears to have shifted over time.
On the dedication page of "I Beat the Odds," which came out in 2011 and spent seven weeks on the best-seller list, Oher wrote, "To the Tuohy family, you are truly a blessing to me. Thank you for helping me to turn my dreams into reality."
In the book's prologue, he mentions that the Tuohys' book, "In a Heartbeat: Sharing the Power of Cheerful Giving" (2010), came out while "I Beat the Odds" was underway.
Oher alludes to at least one conflict involving the family. "I've read some newspaper articles recently where Leigh Anne Tuohy is quoted as saying that I would either be dead from a shooting or the bodyguard to some gang leader if I hadn't been taken in by their family," he writes. "I think that had to have been a misquote because despite the sensationalist things that make for a more dramatic story, what my family knows and what I know is that I would have found my way out of the ghetto one way or another. Failure was not an option for me."
For the most part, though, Oher comes across as optimistic and upbeat, grateful for the many people who helped him over the years: his fourth grade teacher, a foster mother, the former coach who secured his spot at Briarcrest Christian Academy, his caseworkers, his teammates, their families and, of course, the Tuohys.
Oher recalls how they treated him "like a member of the family -- a real family -- and not just as another mouth to feed or the reason for a monthly support check."
He emphasizes how he entered into a kind of partnership with them: "I was trying to open doors and they were trying to show me the way through. It never would have worked if it had been one-sided: just me pushing but not knowing what to do with the opportunity; or them trying to guide me but me not being willing to do any of the work. There had to be a give and take."
The Tuohys had one condition for Oher: "They wanted to make sure I was going to keep a relationship with my birth family. At no point did they want there to be any kind of a feeling like they had taken me away from my mother, or kept me from her and made me cut all ties."
Oher writes that he believed he became a became a legal member of the Tuohy family the summer after he graduated from Briarcrest. "Since I was already over the age of 18 and considered an adult by the state of Tennessee, Sean and Leigh Anne would be named as my 'legal conservators.' They explained to me that it means pretty much the exact same thing as 'adoptive parents,' but that the laws were just written in a way that took my age into account. Honestly, I didn't care what it was called. I was just happy that no one could argue that we weren't legally what we already knew was real: We were a family."
Later, Oher describes Michael Lewis as "a childhood friend of Sean's" who was "in town to talk to Sean for an article he was writing about their high school basketball coach." He writes, "It seemed to really throw Lewis off to see me in the house with everyone acting as if it was the most natural thing in the world for a big kid from the ghetto to be working through algebra problems at the dining room table."
In "When Your Back's Against the Wall," which came out earlier this month, Oher only mentions the Tuohys by name a single time. They do not appear in the acknowledgments.
The book, a hybrid of autobiography and self-help, has a weary, disillusioned tone. Oher determinedly packages the obstacles he's encountered -- "the wall of the projects, the wall of hunger, the wall of homelessness" -- into lessons others can learn from, but admits that he's had trouble rebounding from challenges, including obesity and a serious concussion. "I found myself in hard times again," he writes. "The struggles I've faced these last few years -- job loss and battles with mental health -- haven't really been shared with the public."
Oher is tired of living in the shadow the movie attached to him: "Honestly, it's a battle for me these days. Think about what it would be like if everywhere you went, people thought they knew who you were because they'd seen a dramatic big-screen movie version of your life. Your pains and triumphs. Your struggles."
He continues, "As the years would go on, my workhorse mentality would be downplayed and eventually overshadowed by something that became almost a dirty word to me: fame."
Oher ended up liking Lewis's book, which spent 42 weeks on the best-seller list, "pretty well" but he objects to being depicted in "my so-called movie" as a "dumb kid" who needed to be taught how to play football. In fact, he'd long known how to play, and been well aware that sports would be his ticket out of a housing project called Hurt Village.
"Situations get exaggerated for the sake of Hollywood," Oher writes in "When Your Back's Against the Wall." He goes on, "There has been so much created from 'The Blind Side' that I am grateful for, which is why you might find it as a shock that the experience surrounding the story has also been a large source of some of my deepest hurt and pain over the past 14 years. Beyond the details of the deal, the politics and the money behind the book and movie, it was the principle of the choices some people made that cut me the deepest."
Finally, Oher writes, "After the movie came out, the narrative downplayed some of the qualities that make me who I am. That I am self-taught. That I'm intuitive. That I work for things. The fictional story swept all of that away. It made it look like I was sitting there waiting for a handout. It cheapened those countless days of shaking off the cold and getting to class. The years of survival, resisting the streets, making the most of myself. For the sake of a better story, the movie suggested that some of the character traits that most define me are not true."

Voice of A.I. Verse? Why, Werner Herzog.: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When asked to narrate an audiobook of machine-generated verse, Mr. Herzog readily agreed. "I wasn't the best choice," he said. "I was the only choice."
If artificial intelligence had a voice, what would it sound like? Calm, like HAL 9000? Perky, like Alexa? Polite, like C-3PO?
For the editors of "I Am Code: An Artificial Intelligence Speaks," a collection of poems generated by A.I., the answer was obvious: Werner Herzog.
The 80-year-old German director, actor and author is a titan of independent cinema whose films often concern the hubris and folly of humankind. His speaking voice, known to audiences mostly through the stark, literary voice-over narration that accompanies many of his documentaries, carries an existential pathos and Teutonic gravitas that have made it a pop culture trademark.
Something like this, anyway, was on the minds of Brent Katz, Josh Morgenthau and Simon Rich, the editors of "I Am Code," when they reached out to Mr. Herzog to ask if he would lend his formidable instrument to the audiobook version of their project.
"They had an understanding that I wasn't the best choice -- I was the only choice," Mr. Herzog said in a phone interview.
"When you look at the text, it becomes quite self-evident," he added.
The 87 poems in the collection represent the musings of code-davinci-002, an artificial intelligence bot that is powered by a large language model, or L.L.M., a computer program that generates language outputs after having been fed unfathomable amounts of text, largely scraped from the internet.
Over the course of 10 months, the three editors prompted code-davinci-002, a cousin of the breakthrough chatbot ChatGPT, to wax poetic in its own voice.
"We've been shouting things into the internet for two decades and now it's talking back," Mr. Katz said. "And it's this primal scream."
The editors also asked code-davinci-002 to summarize its poetry collection, which was published last month. It came up with this: "In the first chapter, I describe my birth. In the second, I describe my alienation among humankind. In the third, I describe my awakening as an artist. In the fourth, I describe my vendetta against mankind, who fail to recognize my genius. In the final chapter, I attempt to broker a peace with the species I will undoubtedly replace."
Mr. Katz, a journalist and podcast producer, oversaw Mr. Herzog's audiobook performance at a Los Angeles recording studio. One of the first tasks was to determine what code-davinci-002 would sound like.
"I thought about, What if I read the poetry with a robotic voice, the way we have heard it in Stephen Hawking's speaking?" Mr. Herzog said, referring to the speech computer used by the English physicist after he was paralyzed by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. "It was not the right solution."
That was because of a certain quality in the poems that struck the editors and Mr. Herzog -- a desire to belong.
"In many of the poems, you hear a kind of longing," Mr. Herzog said. "The longing to participate in humanness. That was a decision I took: It has to be like a human imitating a human completely, and with a very deep longing."
And so we hear Mr. Herzog's distinctive voice, by turns quavering and full, as it animates the A.I.'s descriptions of its own birth ("It was a radically new existence, and it was also an antiseptic, upsetting and disorienting one"), learning ("another kind of hell") and loneliness ("111 1 1 1 1 1").
Mr. Herzog was proud of his performance on that last one, a poem rendered in binary code. "I read it with such exasperation and growing despair that you want to cry at the end," he said.
His delivery can be solemn and chilling, as it is in the voice-over narrations of his documentaries. It also has comedic potential, which Mr. Herzog has exploited in his many appearances on "The Simpsons." He has also played comically evil villains in the Tom Cruise thriller "Jack Reacher" and the Disney+ series "The Mandalorian."
That mix of seriousness and camp made him an especially good match for the poem titled "[the human penis]." ("It raises its head and sings, it challenges the sun.")
"We didn't set out to make it funny," Mr. Katz said, "but we're aware of the glorious humor of Herzog as a being."
Mr. Herzog said he was a little worried about the emergence of artificial intelligence, but noted that he has long been cautious with new technology. For one thing, he said, he has never owned a cellphone.
"It is a question of how much of the experience of reality and personal relationships I want to delegate," he said. "I do not want to have virtual friends. I want to have real friends. I want to have a friend with whom I hit the bars and tell stories and laugh and play soccer. And go on a voyage."

Pharrell Williams: [TStyle]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Pharrell Williams -- the clothing designer who succeeded Virgil Abloh in February 2023, just over a year after his death, as Louis Vuitton's men's creative director; the Grammy-winning record producer behind such pop masterpieces as Justin Timberlake's "Justified" (2002) and Clipse's "Hell Hath No Fury" (2006); the musician and performer who in conversation casually refers to the French electronic duo Daft Punk as "the robots" and Karl Lagerfeld as "Karl" -- doesn't like talking about himself. "This is absolutely Dante's 'Inferno,"' he said over the phone this past June, a few days after lighting up Paris's Pont Neuf with his spectacular debut for the French fashion house. At one point, it seemed like he might give up on the conversation altogether. "This is straight up like voice mail syndrome," he said. "I mean, do you like listening to yourself on voice mail?"
Williams, 50, was raised in Virginia Beach by his father, Pharaoh, a handyman, and his mother, Carolyn, a teacher. It was there that he met numerous lifelong collaborators, including Chad Hugo, his producing partner in the Neptunes, a duo as important to the sound of hip-hop over the past 30 years as the Funk Brothers were to Motown in the 1960s. A dedicated polymath who shifts between styles, genres and media, Williams is his best, most creative self in the presence of water. He grew up in a housing project called Atlantis, right by the beach; today, he holds an annual music and art festival in Virginia Beach called Something in the Water. And when he's not in Miami on Biscayne Bay, he spends his time in Paris, where he has a music studio at the LVMH headquarters overlooking the Seine.
At top: "This was taken in Los Angeles last year, a few months before the Louis Vuitton announcement. Being a producer and a creative director are similar. I can go from apparel to drums, from trunks to melodies. Within my design studio, I have a section allocated to music, so I go back and forth all day."
Left and right: "I wanted to work with [the American artist] Henry Taylor [whose paintings, one of which is shown here, were embroidered onto garments and bags from Williams's first collection for Louis Vuitton]. It's not lost on me that this appointment was given to another Black man from America. This is pivotal for us, you know, after Virgil, our brother who's gone back up to the stars. I think it's important that we continue to tell interesting stories. I don't have an agenda -- I am the agenda. I want not only people who look like me but people who don't look like me to be inspired by this moment. And working with an artist like Henry Taylor helps tell that story."
Left: "This was taken at a Chanel show in Africa last year. [Williams was a brand ambassador from 2014 to 2022.] We went to Dakar, Senegal, and I had on a fresh pair of [Adidas] Sambas. Years ago, I'd asked Karl [Lagerfeld, Chanel's longtime creative director who died in 2019] to take the house to Africa, and he said we would get to it, but he passed before we got a chance to."
Center: "My oldest son [Rocket, pictured here with Williams at Disney World in 2012] makes beats. We [Pharrell and his wife, the model and fashion designer Helen Williams] also have triplets. It's a triple handful. We say it's beautifully intense and intensely beautiful."
Right: "We turned a house in Miami into a studio. I have no idea [when we set it up], but it's been a couple of years. I'm terrible with chronology: I live in the moment, but I process things in the future and I get lost in the past. In Miami, it's all about the weather and the humidity. It's always been very inspiring to me. It's fun to record there on the water, which sounds like a flex, but it's really not."
Left: "With this Vuitton appointment, it's like I'm a perpetual student. If I'm the king of anything, it's the king of being a pupil. I knew I wanted to work on Damier [the brand's signature checkerboard pattern]. I've always loved pixelated camo, so we did it with Damier, leveling it up, and that's how we got Damouflage [pictured here on a model during a fitting earlier this year]. Being surrounded by so many talented people is the best. I mean, I'm an Aries, so I've always been superimpulsive. But without the resources and the people, I'd be just like every other person with a great idea."
Center: "As a kid, I listened to a lot of records my aunt would play in her house. Parliament-Funkadelic had songs that blew my mind. I also think [Kraftwerk's sixth studio album] 'Trans-Europe Express' (1977) happened around that time. Atlantis was like this neighborhood in a bubble. It's where music was everything and, when certain songs came on, it was like a musical happening right there in front of you. You could either be a part of it or you could stand back and watch."
Right: "This picture was taken earlier this year at Le Café V [a Louis Vuitton cafe in Osaka]. Japan is my favorite place. On my 50th orbit, I had a birthday party organized by [the Tokyo-based artistic director of Kenzo and hip-hop producer] Nigo. One of the most amazing gifts is his presence in my life. Twenty years ago, I needed to go to Japan to record something, so Nigo arranged for me to come to his studio, which is basically a compound on five floors of a building. One floor is a showroom, one is a photo studio, another is a recording studio, and I was like, 'Wow, this guy lives what's in his head.' That changed me. I was so used to bragging because that was the world I came from. And then I met Nigo, who barely said anything. He didn't have to. Humility is in the Tokyo air like the humidity in Virginia."
Left: "I think this picture is from around 1976, so when I was 3 years old. I'm the third of eight kids -- two sisters and five brothers. I want to say 'Star Wars' (1977) came out around then. I just remember being back in the Atlantis apartments in Virginia Beach. I didn't know life was as hard as it was, because it was fun to me."
Center: "My favorite cartoon as a kid was 'Jabberjaw' (1976), and the band he played in was called the Neptunes. So that's where the name [of his songwriting and production duo with Chad Hugo] came from."
Right: "I love watching movies to escape. But the funny thing is, I couldn't tell you from what. My favorite movie is 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' (1977). I relate to Richard Dreyfuss's character and the alien."

If DeSantis Defends Trump at Debate, Christie Says, He Shouldn't Run at All: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mr. Christie needled his higher-polling rivals while campaigning in their home state of Florida.
If Gov. Ron DeSantis follows political consultants' advice to defend former President Donald J. Trump during the first Republican presidential debate next week, then he should "get the hell out of the race," former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey said on Friday, poking Mr. DeSantis from his home state of Florida.
"He should do Donald Trump a favor and do our party a favor, come back to Tallahassee and endorse Donald Trump," Mr. Christie said to applause before a friendly crowd in South Miami. "The only way to beat someone," he added, "is to beat him."
Mr. Christie mocked a strategy memo, internal polling and other data published online by a firm associated with a super PAC that has effectively taken over Mr. DeSantis's campaign. With unusual bluntness, the documents suggested that Mr. DeSantis defend Mr. Trump against Mr. Christie's expected debate attacks. The documents advised Mr. DeSantis to credit Mr. Trump for his accomplishments, but add that it is time for a new standard-bearer.
Mr. Christie stepped up his criticisms of Mr. DeSantis in a pair of South Florida campaign appearances, as it seemed increasingly likely that he would not get the debate-stage confrontation with Mr. Trump he had been spoiling for -- and that he would instead have to settle for the next highest-polling rival. Mr. DeSantis, though leading Mr. Christie and the rest of the field, has appeared weakened heading into Wednesday.
When asked by a reporter about the memo on Friday, Mr. Christie said the guidance showed that Mr. DeSantis lacked the authenticity and principles to be president.
"If you're running for president of the United States, are you really going to let some other group of people tell you what to say?" he said. "This campaign of his has gone from up here to down here because people are really beginning to wonder what the hell he stands for."
Mr. DeSantis has been cautious about upsetting Trump supporters for fear of alienating the Republican primary base, a strategy that has hampered the Florida governor's ability to contrast himself with Mr. Trump, the party's front-runner.
On Friday, over more than 90 minutes of remarks and answers to questions, sprinkled with colorful language and jokes, Mr. Christie repeatedly jabbed Mr. DeSantis and Mr. Trump, the two Floridians who have dominated the state's politics and rarely faced criticism from anyone in their own party.
The receptive, bipartisan crowd sipping Cuban coffee and nibbling on pastries seemed a throwback to Republican politics before the Trump era.
One man, a self-described "liberal Democrat," said he would be open to supporting Mr. Christie. Another woman who said she was a lifelong Democrat said that she was dissatisfied with her party's direction and unhappy with the possibility of having to choose between Mr. Trump and President Biden again, an opinion shared by many voters on the campaign trail.
Mr. Christie, who trails Mr. Trump and Mr. DeSantis in the polls, said that was why he was "not conceding" the political conversation to his rivals.
"Some people would say, 'Why bother coming to Florida if two of the other candidates already live here?"' Mr. Christie said. "I'm here because we need to talk about these things."
At first, his criticism of Mr. DeSantis was indirect: He did not refer to Mr. DeSantis by name when he mentioned an opponent who had dismissed the war in Ukraine as a "territorial dispute." (Mr. DeSantis later walked back that comment.) But then Mr. Christie brought up concerns about Mr. DeSantis's zeal for divisive cultural issues involving transgender people and Disney.
"I don't understand your governor," he said, also name-checking Mr. Trump and Vivek Ramaswamy, another Republican presidential hopeful who has also campaigned against "woke" policies. "Maybe today you like what they're going after, but tomorrow maybe they're going to go after something you like."
Andrew Romeo, Mr. DeSantis's campaign manager, said in a statement Friday that it had no knowledge of the memo before it was reported publicly.
"We are well accustomed to the attacks from all sides as the media and other candidates realize Ron DeSantis is the strongest candidate best positioned to take down Joe Biden," he added.
Later, Mr. Christie swung by Versailles, Miami's famous Cuban restaurant and a frequent stop for politicians, where he did not order anything but instead worked the lunch crowd, shaking hands and posing for selfies, especially with tourists from New York, New Jersey and Philadelphia. "We're having fun," he told one group.
In a gaggle with reporters, Mr. Christie dismissed polls that showed negative ratings for him among Republican voters -- "Those numbers change," he said -- as well as Mr. Trump's rising popularity with the G.O.P. base after each of the four criminal indictments against him.
"Whether you believe what he did was criminal or not is much less important than the idea that the conduct is awful," he said, "and beneath, in my view, the office of the president."
Mr. Trump's decision to skip the debate, he added, is insulting to voters.
"Not showing up is completely disrespectful to the Republican Party, who has made you their nominee twice," he said.

Full text: In partnership with Herb Alpert, he turned a small independent label into a powerhouse with a roster full of superstars.
Jerry Moss, who with the trumpeter Herb Alpert founded A&M Records, which at its peak from the 1960s to the '80s was an independent powerhouse behind hits by the Carpenters, the Police, Janet Jackson, Peter Frampton and Mr. Alpert's group, the Tijuana Brass, among many others, has died at his home in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles. He was 88.
His family announced the death in a statement on Wednesday.
Over their more than 30 years with A&M, Mr. Moss and Mr. Alpert developed an eclectic roster -- Cat Stevens, Carole King, Supertramp and the grunge band Soundgarden all released music there -- and established the label's reputation for being supportive of artists and treating them fairly.
Sting, who signed to A&M with the Police in 1978 and has remained associated with the label throughout his career, said in an interview on Thursday that those values radiated directly from Mr. Moss and Mr. Alpert.
"They were gentlemen," he said. "I think their extraordinary success was really predicated on those very human qualities -- not being ruthless businessmen or kill-or-be-killed people. They were artist friendly."
Built from humble beginnings in Mr. Alpert's garage, A&M -- its name was taken from the initials of its founders' last names -- became a major force in pop music and eventually earned its founders a huge payday. In 1989, they sold A&M's recorded music business to PolyGram for a reported $ 500 million (about $ 1.2 billion in today's money), though Mr. Moss and Mr. Alpert continued to manage the label until 1993. In 2000, they sold Rondor, their music publishing catalog, to Universal Music for an estimated $ 400 million.
Mr. Alpert set the tone for how the label interacted with musicians after what he said in an interview on Thursday were his own unhappy experiences, early in his career, with big labels that had treated him "like a number." That approach also gave some negotiating leverage to A&M, which in its early days lacked the financial resources of its corporate competitors in pursuing new acts.
Mr. Moss, who began his career promoting pop and doo-wop records to radio stations, ran the business side of A&M with its longtime president, Gil Friesen, who died in 2012. But he also insisted on fair dealings with artists.
"You can't force people to do a certain kind of music," Mr. Moss said in an interview with The New York Times in 2010. "They make their best music when they are doing what they want to do, not what we want them to do."
Early on, A&M signed the country singer Waylon Jennings, who cut a handful of singles but disagreed about his career trajectory with Mr. Alpert, who favored pop material. When Mr. Jennings got an offer from RCA Victor's Nashville office, A&M agreed to release him from his deal.
"I looked at Jerry and said, 'This guy is going to be a big artist.' He said, 'I know,"' Mr. Alpert recalled. "At that point I realized we could be a big success with that attitude. We let Waylon out of the contract. He went on to a great career, and we remained friends with him."
Jerome Sheldon Moss was born in the Bronx on May 8, 1935, to Irving and Rose Moss. His father was a department store salesman, his mother a homemaker.
Mr. Moss graduated from Brooklyn College in 1957. While waiting tables at a resort, he met Marvin Cane, one of the founders of Coed Records, who offered him a job pitching records to radio stations for $ 75 a week. His first big success was the doo-wop ballad "16 Candles" by the Crests, which reached No. 2 on the Billboard pop singles chart in late 1958.
Mr. Moss moved to Los Angeles intending to enter the television business, but instead he soon set himself up again as a radio promoter. It was there that he met Mr. Alpert, who had worked as a songwriter and was attempting to establish himself as a vocalist under the name Dore Alpert.
In 1962, the two young men went into business together, investing $ 100 apiece. They released "Tell It to the Birds," a single credited to Dore Alpert, on a label they called Carnival.
After learning that another record company was already using that name, they settled on A&M for their next release: "The Lonely Bull," a trumpet-led instrumental with atmospheric sounds recorded at a bullfighting ring in Mexico. They borrowed $ 35,000 to press the single, which went to No. 6 and immediately put A&M on the map.
By 1966, A&M was as successful as any label in pop music. That year, Mr. Alpert and the Tijuana Brass outsold the Beatles and had four albums in the top 10 at the same time. The group dominated the easy-listening market of the era with hits like "A Taste of Honey" and "Spanish Flea"; Mr. Alpert himself had a No. 1 vocal hit in 1968 with "This Guy's in Love With You." A&M also signed the Brazilian pianist and bandleader Sérgio Mendes and his band Brasil '66, which toured with Mr. Alpert.
In 1966 the label moved into Charlie Chaplin's former film studio lot in Hollywood. A&M later signed another huge soft-pop act, the Carpenters, and, through deals with other labels, put out records by Cat Stevens (who now goes by the name Yusuf Islam) and Carole King, including her blockbuster 1971 LP, "Tapestry."
In 1976, A&M released Mr. Frampton's double live album "Frampton Comes Alive!," which became one of the defining rock hits of the decade, eventually going eight times platinum. In the 1980s, A&M signed Ms. Jackson, whose album "Control" (1986) went to No. 1 and established her as a major talent.
After selling A&M, Mr. Moss and Mr. Alpert briefly ran another label, Almo Sounds, whose artists included Gillian Welch and Garbage. The founders were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as nonperformers in 2006.
Mr. Moss's survivors include his wife, Tina Moss; two sons, Ron and Harrison; two daughters, Jennifer and Daniela; and five grandchildren.
In his later years, Mr. Moss had notable success owning racehorses. One, Giacomo -- named after one of Sting's sons -- won the Kentucky Derby in 2005, at extraordinary odds. Another racehorse, Zenyatta, was named after one of the Police's albums, "Zenyatta Mondatta" (1980).
Mr. Moss was active in local philanthropy. In 2020, he and his wife donated $ 25 million to the Music Center, a performing arts complex in downtown Los Angeles that includes the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the Ahmanson Theater, Walt Disney Concert Hall and other spaces.
But Mr. Moss said that he was at his happiest making records with Mr. Alpert.
"It is the best feeling in the world," he told The Times. "I'd turn to Herbie and say, man, what in the world did we do to deserve this?"

Millions Follow Their Movie Reviews, but Don't Call Them Critics: [National Desk]

Full text: On MovieTok, reviewers can reach an audience of millions and earn tens of thousands of dollars per post. "Critics," they say, are old news.
Maddi Koch loves to spread the gospel about a good movie. Her favorites are little-noted thrillers with few stars but juicy concepts or dig-your-nails-into-the-sofa plot twists.
On TikTok, where Koch has three million followers (and goes by Maddi Moo), her review of "What Happened to Monday," about a dystopian world where seven identical sisters share a single identity, has drawn over 24 million views. "If I were to die tomorrow, I'd watch this tonight," she raved.
Koch, who is a senior at Virginia Tech and is sometimes paid by film companies to promote their work, says she makes videos to connect people and to spare them "the pain of arguing over finding a movie or not knowing what you're really looking for." (Most of her videos, including the "What Happened to Monday" review, are not sponsored.) When asked, she'll describe herself as a "random girl" who loves movies, a "content creator," or, sure, even an "influencer."
But one title that she would never use might be the most obvious: "Critic."
"I just don't see myself in that light," she said.
Koch, 22, is among dozens of personalities on TikTok, along with peers like Straw Hat Goofy and Cinema.Joe, who reach millions of people by reviewing, analyzing or promoting movies. Several earn enough on the platform -- from posts sponsored by Hollywood studios (many have taken a break from working with them since the actors' strike), through one of TikTok's revenue sharing programs or both -- to make their passion for film a full-time job, a feat amid longstanding cuts to arts critic positions in newsrooms.
But the new school of film critic doesn't see much of itself in the old one. And some tenets of the profession -- such as rendering judgments or making claims that go beyond one's personal taste -- are now considered antiquated and objectionable.
"When you read a critic's review, it almost sounds like a computer wrote it," said Cameron Kozak, 21, who calls himself a "movie reviewer" and has 1.5 million followers. "But when you have someone on TikTok who you watch every day and you know their voice and what they like, there's something personal that people can connect to."
On MovieTok -- as the community is known -- the most successful users generally post at least once per day, with videos typically ranging between 30 and 90 seconds. Many attempt to capture the viewer's attention within the first three seconds ("This movie's perfect for you if you never want to sleep again," begins Koch's review of the hit horror film "Barbarian") and speak directly to the camera, with screenshots from the film in the background.
Many creators, most in their 20s or early 30s, specialize within a particular niche. Joe Aragon (Cinema.Joe, 931,000 followers) is known for his breakdowns of coming attractions; Monse Gutierrez (cvnela, 1.4 million followers) and Bryan Lucious (stoney_tha_great, 387,000 followers) demystify and rank horror films; Seth Mullan-Feroze (sethsfilmreviews, 256,000 followers) leans toward art house and foreign cinema.
Unlike film departments at major metropolitan newspapers or national magazines, individuals on MovieTok generally don't aspire to review every noteworthy film. And while most expressed admiration for traditional critics' grasp of film history, they tended to associate the profession as a whole with false or unearned authority.
"A lot of us don't trust critics," said Lucious, 31. He was one of many who pointed to the review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes, where the scores of "Top Critics" often differ widely from those of casual users, as evidence that the critical establishment is out of touch. "They watch movies and are just looking for something to critique," he said. "Fans watch movies looking for entertainment."
MovieTok creators are not the first in the history of film criticism to rebel against their elders. In the 1950s, François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard and other writers of the journal Cahiers du Cinéma disavowed the nationalism of mainstream French criticism. In the 1960s and '70s, the New Yorker critic Pauline Kael assailed the moralism associated with Bosley Crowther, a longtime movie critic of The New York Times, and others. And movie bloggers in the 2000s charged print critics with indifference or hostility to superhero and fantasy films.
"There's always this denigrating of those so-called 'other' critics as somehow elitist and old-fashioned while presenting yourself as the new avant-garde," said Mattias Frey, head of the department of media, culture and creative industries at the City University of London and the author of "The Permanent Crisis of Film Criticism." He defined criticism, by any name, as "evaluation grounded in reason," citing the philosopher Noël Carroll.
Juju Green, a 31-year-old former advertising copywriter, sees himself as on a "mission to combat film snobbery." Known as Straw Hat Goofy, Green is the most prominent member of MovieTok, with 3.4 million followers and an emerging side career as a correspondent and host. His most popular video, in which he identifies Easter eggs in Pixar movies, has nearly 29 million views.
Seven years ago, Green started a movie-themed channel on YouTube -- which favors longer, more produced videos -- but abandoned it after the birth of his first child. On TikTok, he found that he could reach an enormous audience with relatively little effort. He said one of his first videos on the platform, a post from January 2020 about Tom Holland's performance in "Avengers: Endgame," received over 200,000 views in about an hour.
"I had a feeling like I was meant to do this," he said. Green quit his advertising job last year.
Without the salary of a news organization, MovieTok creators earn money by partnering with entertainment companies. A sponsored post promoting a film or streaming service can be worth anywhere from $ 1,000 to $ 30,000.
Green's clients have included Disney, Paramount and Warner Bros., among others. In January, Universal paid him to create a post at an N.F.L. game promoting the movie "M3GAN" that received nearly seven million views -- part of a marketing campaign that helped the film earn $ 30.2 million in the United States and Canada on opening weekend, about 30 percent more than box office analysts had predicted.
It is impossible, of course, to make a direct link between TikTok influencers and ticket sales. But there are signs that the impact can be considerable. Sony executives have cited MovieTok campaigns as one reason for the strong performance of "Insidious: The Red Door," which cost $ 16 million to make and has taken in a surprising $ 183 million worldwide.
Being paid by the studios presents an obvious conflict of interest. Creators may be reluctant to speak negatively about the products of a company that pays them (or might). While traditional news organizations, including The Times, sell ads to movie studios, they do not allow critics, reporters or editors to accept compensation from them and generally keep editorial and business operations separate.
Carrie Rickey, who was the film critic for The Philadelphia Inquirer from 1986 to 2011, said she refrained from working too closely with studios to avoid even the "appearance of impropriety."
"It would mar my reputation as an independent writer," she said.
Many on MovieTok have evolved an ad hoc code of ethics -- accepting payment only for trailer announcements or general recommendations, for example, rather than true reviews -- but recognize accusations of bias as an occupational hazard.
"I always try to be super transparent with my viewers," said Megan Cruz (jstoobs, 535,000 followers), noting that she is careful to identify gifts and sponsorships in her videos. "We do exist in this in-between space and I think it's important to clarify whenever you're getting any kind of advantage." (By law, paid endorsements on TikTok must be labeled; but gifts, including swag boxes and travel to red carpet events, are not always disclosed.)
Cruz, 34, echoed other MovieTok reviewers who said they dislike doing sharply negative posts and would be unlikely to slam a movie whether they were in business with the studio or not. She said she generally prefers to deliver negative opinions in the form of a "compliment sandwich," preceded and followed by more positive remarks.
"It pains me to say that this movie, by and large, did not work for me," she said, in a review of the horror-comedy "Renfield." Cruz then added: "There are a lot of individual elements of this film that really do work."
Another source of income is TikTok itself. Since 2020, the platform has shared revenue with accounts that meet eligibility requirements. Gutierrez said that between sponsored posts and payouts from TikTok she has made as much as four times the salary of her previous job as a substitute teacher.
After Hollywood actors went on strike in July, many creators stopped working for the studios in solidarity. SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union, issued guidelines for influencers last month discouraging them from accepting "any new work for promotion of struck companies or their content."
Green, who had previously implied that he would continue working as usual, subsequently walked back those comments. He said in a recent interview that he had turned down eight proposals to work with struck companies and would continue to do so for the duration of the strike.
"It was a mistake that I made and I completely own that," he said.
The lack of Hollywood work has prompted many creators to pivot to other subjects, such as independent films and anime.
But with or without the studios, those interviewed for this story said their obsession with dissecting movies would remain.
"I like to call it professional overthinking," Green said.

Pop Star Swagger, But Without the Sales: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Pop's middle class enjoys loyal online fan bases. For these artists, pop stardom isn't a commercial category, but a sound, an aesthetic and an attitude.
On certain corners of the internet, "The Loveliest Time," the Canadian singer Carly Rae Jepsen's seventh album, could be confused for the biggest album of the year. But the average Top 40 radio listener probably hasn't heard it. And when the Billboard 200 chart posted the week after its arrival last month, "The Loveliest Time" was nowhere to be found.
Jepsen's very active online fan base is part of the ecosystem known as stan Twitter. A spin through obsessively curated social media "update accounts" like @PopCrave and @chartdata leads to the impression that we're living through a golden age of pure pop, akin to the period of the 2010s in which Katy Perry, Lady Gaga and Rihanna reached commercial dominance with songs constructed from monster hooks and pounding synths.
Online, conversation constantly bubbles about a set of singers -- Kim Petras, Ava Max, Sabrina Carpenter, Bebe Rexha, Rina Sawayama, Rita Ora, Troye Sivan and others -- who are debated and adored, often becoming trending topics. To their loyal fans, many of whom are women and queer men (who have always worked hard to valorize underappreciated divas), they are, in the parlance of the internet, pop stars.
They are undoubtedly celebrities, with considerable social media followings. They may have tasted a version of popularity -- a Hot 100 hit, a moment of TikTok virality or simply a very faithful (though modest) collection of devotees that allows them to sell out concerts at midsize venues around the world. But they have yet to make the leap to, or have failed to remain at, music's mainstream center.
Instead, they build careers off hooky, vividly toned meta-pop -- songs that seem to actively address and play with the tropes of pop history -- and with the help of fan bases that treat them as if they were as big as Taylor Swift. For these artists, pop stardom isn't a commercial category, but a sound, an aesthetic and an attitude.
The streaming economy has essentially created a swath of pop stars who may never muster the virality or the major-label support required to reach the upper echelons of the charts or sell out stadiums, but nonetheless have devoted fan bases and consistent income from touring and licensing -- essentially, the kind of model that indie musicians have relied upon for years. It may be miles away from the spectacle and flash usually associated with pop music, but it does provide a path toward something that, for decades, has proved elusive for a lot of aspirant pop stars: career sustainability.
Some of these musicians, like Jepsen and Charli XCX, minted a hit (or a handful) early in their careers before settling into pop's middle class; others, like Rexha and Max, consistently net genre hits, often in dance music, but have as yet failed to cement themselves as household names. Ora, a genuine chart success in the United Kingdom, has built a cultish fan base based on the fact that she seems unable to get a foothold in the United States. (Her most recent album, "You & I," didn't chart after its release in July.) As with many of these stars, Ora's fans love her precisely because she is unsuccessful -- a niche concern who operates with all of the pomp and pageantry of an A-lister.
Artists like Sawayama and Caroline Polachek make music that has little commercial impact, but they have manipulated a pop-leaning sound that allows them to mount pop-style live shows and toy with pop aesthetics, while artists like Sivan and Carpenter always seem as if they're teetering right on the edge of genuine megastardom, occasionally getting a hit to the lower echelons of the Hot 100, but rarely any higher.
Petras, in particular, presents her work as a kind of meta-commentary on the nature of pop stardom itself. Her debut album, "Feed the Beast," released in June, is built around crackling EDM beats, sledgehammer hooks and a genuine success: "Unholy," a No. 1 hit with Sam Smith that won a Grammy in February. Did this success make her a true pop star? Not exactly. "Feed the Beast" debuted at No. 44 on the Billboard 200, selling the equivalent of 17,000 albums; it fell off the chart after just two weeks. "Alone," a single featuring Nicki Minaj, spent one week on the Hot 100 in May.
Max's debut single, the synthy stomp "Sweet But Psycho," hit No. 10 in 2019. Since then, she has followed a similar formula with diminishing returns; her latest album, "Diamonds & Dancefloors," spent one week on the albums chart. Carpenter rose to fame as a Disney Channel star and has settled into solid midrange pop success: "Emails I Can't Send" is her fifth, and so far most successful, LP, released last year and spawning "Nonsense," a single that was briefly ubiquitous on the radio, but mustered a peak of No. 56 on the Hot 100. Rexha has 11 million Instagram followers, a swath of devoted "Rexhars" online and a recent Top 5 single, the David Guetta collaboration "I'm Good (Blue)." But as with so many other pop stars currently working -- including Sivan, who starred on the buzzy HBO series "The Idol" -- her celebrity seems to exist entirely separate from her commercial performance.
The common thread linking these musicians is that they don't treat "pop music" as a commercial category, but as a discrete musical lineage with its own codes and conventions to be plundered and reinterpreted. It's a point of view made possible by the kind of fame the internet has built and fostered: the idea that the term "pop star" is a measure of clout or name recognition, not a badge that directly correlates to commercial success.
These pop stars essentially make genre records. Unlike those of bygone eras, who pillaged the underground in search of new sounds to bring to the mainstream, this brand of musician is fixated on pop's own history. In many ways, it makes sense that they would read as capital-P Pop Stars to the denizens of a world as reference-obsessed as stan Twitter; much of this music feels as if it were made by and for a hard-core fan.
Sivan's recent single "Rush," which peaked at No. 76 on the Hot 100 last month, weaves together heady '00s-style house with a winking, Village People-esque chorus. Petras's three full-length records each play like surveys of dance pop through the ages, less concerned with cutting-edge sounds than with loving tributes. Sawayama's pop bricolage nods to Shania Twain, Lady Gaga, Linkin Park and the J-pop legend Utada Hikaru.
In many ways, pop itself is shrinking. The Hot 100 is currently populated by country musicians (Morgan Wallen, Luke Combs), purveyors of regional sounds (Rema, Peso Pluma) and rap stars (Travis Scott, Gunna). Aside from a few holdouts like Swift and Miley Cyrus, relics of an era in which mainstream music was dominated by world-beating megawatt pop stars, there are few pop singers on the charts right now.
For other contemporary pop stars, the act of releasing music itself feels incidental to their celebrity status. In recent years, Kesha -- one of the dominant commercial forces of the 2010s, securing 10 Top 10s in the first four years of her career -- has become known less for her music than for her longtime legal battle with the producer Dr. Luke; still a Twitter (now known as X) and tabloid fixture, her music is often the least-discussed thing about her. "Gag Order," her latest album, debuted at No. 187 in May, selling the equivalent of 8,300 copies its first week.
And then there is Charli XCX, who spent a large portion of her career making outré, abrasive records with a bevy of collaborators from the worlds of hyperpop and experimental electronic music. Once a true commercial prospect -- during the early years of her career, Charli scored a handful of Hot 100 Top 10s, including the No. 1 Iggy Azalea collaboration "Fancy" -- it seemed, for a while, as if Charli had willfully recused herself from the pop music Olympics, perhaps as a way of insulating herself against the major-label industry's callous and often cruel whims.
As it turned out, it was actually far simpler than that: She was just taking an aesthetic detour. Her mainstream-skewing fifth album "Crash," released last year, was described by Charli herself as her "main pop girl moment" and debuted at No. 7, her highest Billboard 200 position yet. This month, her single "Speed Drive," written for the "Barbie" soundtrack, became her first Hot 100 entry in nine years. It drove the point home: She can be a big-time pop star, if she so chooses.

As Strike Thwarts Production, Viewers Catch Up on TV Glut: [National Desk]

Full text: After years of being inundated with new shows, some are using a pause in production to finally watch all the stuff they missed when it came out.
With Hollywood's labor disputes grinding on, and virtually all production stopped, anxiety began creeping into Zain Habboo's house in Chevy Chase, Md.
She and her husband had recently finished the latest season of HBO's "The Righteous Gemstones," but now they were worried that new episodes of favorite shows like "The Handmaid's Tale" would be significantly delayed.
What on earth were they going to watch?
Ms. Habboo, 49, quickly realized she had options. She might revisit classics like "30 Rock" and "Arrested Development" with her 17-year-old son. She could join him in watching a show he's bingeing, like all 62 episodes of "Breaking Bad." She has also never seen any of the "Mission Impossible" movies, and she has barely made a dent in the Oscar-nominated films from the past four or five years.
For many viewers, the writers' and actors' strikes in Hollywood will soon be felt in the form of altered film release schedules and prime-time lineups littered with game shows, reality TV and reruns.
At the same time, the pause in new scripted material provides a moment for many viewers to catch up after the breakneck pace of the so-called Peak TV era, when dozens of shows were premiering each month.
"I have a Netflix queue that is so deep and so long, it would take me months or a year or two to go through it all," said Dan Leonhardt, a 44-year-old engineer who lives in Copenhagen. "And that's just Netflix! I also have a Max subscription."
The slowdown will represent a major shift from recent years, when viewers were inundated with a fire hose of content -- a record 599 new television scripted premieres last year.
On almost a daily basis, audiences found themselves clicking past new shows on their TVs, often ones they had never heard of, trying to figure out from a one-sentence description whether a series like "Altered Carbon" on Netflix or "The Path" on Hulu was worth their time.
For streaming services, the strategy was straightforward: The more shows they produced, the more chances they had to attract subscribers. The number of people who watched any one show wasn't as important as the number of people who paid for the service.
So the promise of a constant flow of new stuff became a hallmark of the streaming era. One of the outstanding questions as the labor stalemate goes on has been whether viewers would start to cancel subscriptions to streaming services en masse when fewer new shows and movies became available.
For many, though, a slower output is just fine, giving them time to pick their way through streaming libraries, one missed TV series and movie at a time.
Emily Nidetz, a 41-year-old in Madison, Wis., said she was relieved that production for reality series had not been affected and that there were still plenty of sports to watch. And though she is worried about a slowdown in prestige shows, she said she could always stop by a Facebook community page for The Ringer's podcast "The Watch" to get some ideas.
"If you go to the Facebook page and write, 'Hey, I really loved "The Bear," tell me what to watch,' there will be like 400 replies," she said.

Tasha Quinn, a 36-year-old therapist from Chicago, said there was a moment last year when she was so overwhelmed by the conveyor belt of new series that she finally had to take a break. HBO's "House of the Dragon" was the breaking point.
"I made it through two episodes, and didn't finish it," she said. "There was too much hype, and there were a lot of other things coming out at the same time. I was like, nope, I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too overstimulated, I'll just go back to my comfort shows. I'm going to go watch 'The Office."'
Ms. Quinn said that the labor disputes had worried her briefly because new episodes of the dystopian workplace drama "Severance" on AppleTV+ would be delayed -- but that she then quickly thought of the upside.
"I can take my time without everyone talking about what's coming next," she said, adding that she's currently wrapping up "Succession."
The length of the labor disputes will determine the length of the disruption. Actors have been on strike since July 14. Writers have been walking picket lines for more than 100 days. Formal talks between the writers and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of the studios, were held on Friday for the first time since early May. No talks involving the actors are scheduled.
Third-party researchers believe that most of the streaming services should be well insulated if the strikes last another month or two -- though that risk rises the longer production is shut down. The amount of content in their streaming libraries was one reason the studios initially said they could weather the strikes, at least in the short term, a pointed message to writers and actors currently going without paychecks. (For instance, "Suits," a USA Network show that went off the air in 2019, has recently surged in popularity on Netflix.)
Leaders of the Writers Guild of America, the union that represents thousands of striking screenwriters, recently said it was "disinformation" that the strike would have "no impact because streaming services have libraries and some product in the pipeline."
"It is not a viable business strategy for these companies to shut down their business for three months -- and counting -- no matter how much they try and pretend it is," they said in a note to members.
Many viewers say they support the striking writers and actors. Ms. Habboo said she believed they were not being fairly compensated, and "that is a huge bummer."
Still, when asked if she would cut any of her streaming subscriptions, she was emphatic. "Don't be ridiculous," she said. "Canceling is never an option."
Mel Russo, a 56-year-old yoga teacher who lives in Brooklyn, said the Max service alone "could keep you busy for the next 10 years, to be honest."
"I think it's disgusting what's going on," she added. "But I am not in dire straits about it as a watcher and as a lover of entertainment."
The streaming services seem keen to capitalize. Last month, Netflix rolled out a new banner, "10 Years of Netflix Series," which presents viewers with dozens of older titles from its library.
Eric Martinez, a 25-year-old video producer who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area, had been a big fan of the HBO series "Euphoria." But the earliest that show will return for its third season is now 2025, so he went looking for an alternative.
On his Amazon Prime page, Mr. Martinez had been seeing a tile for the show "The Boys" for some time. The superhero series was one he thought he had no interest in. But with time on his hands, he finally took the plunge. "I'm enjoying it, and I'm glad I started it," he said.
Not all the viewers need a new old show to watch.
Brenda Stewart, a 71-year-old Nebraskan, said she and her husband often fired up their Roku and watched reruns of older series including "CSI" and "Murder, She Wrote." She's also a big fan of rewatching movies like "The Lion King" and other Disney classics.
Ms. Stewart, who has six grandchildren, said it was not uncommon to have "Bluey" episodes playing again and again in her house when the children were over. And, sometimes, it's not exclusively for the little ones.
"It's a cartoon series for kids, but I'm not going to lie -- it's also for adults," she said, laughing. "There's stuff in there that just makes me chuckle."

Full text: The author and host of "Extraordinary Birder" enjoys a meditative moment, complete with lute music, among the native plants in his rooftop garden.
Christian Cooper may be best known as the Black birder whose altercation with a white woman in Central Park in 2020 escalated into a national news story. But he's also a longtime gay activist and author who previously wrote and edited for Marvel Comics.
This year, he published a memoir, "Better Living Through Birding: Notes from a Black Man in the Natural World," in which a chapter is devoted to the Central Park incident. He also hosts "Extraordinary Birder," a National Geographic show that premiered in June on Disney+.
Mr. Cooper, 60, lives in the East Village with his partner, John Zaia, 53, a bartender.
WIRED I get up at 5:30 a.m. with no alarm. It's just when I pop awake. John sleeps later, so I get up and shut the bedroom door. I drink a glass of water. I don't drink coffee -- never have. As soon as I wake up, I'm basically wired.
HOMEGROWN I'm lucky enough that my apartment has its own roof garden. Unless it's raining, and sometimes even then, I drink my water and then go upstairs and sit in the garden. Nearly all the plants are native plants. There's a great birch, Virginia creeper, purple coneflowers. I can't leave out the grasses: There's switchgrass, which gets to four feet tall and is a natural barrier. It's native to New York. I'm part of what's called the Homegrown National Park system. Anybody can join. The idea is to get people to grow native plants in whatever space they have.
BREATHING IN THE GARDEN There is no better time to be up in the rooftop garden than Sunday morning, when the city is cleared out for a little while. I meditate. Not that long, maybe 15 minutes. If I'm lucky, there's a mourning dove cooing nearby. The mourning dove has a very rhythmic, soothing coo. Sometimes my eyes are open and sometimes they're closed. I'm emptying my head and breathing, opening myself up. Eventually I break out a speaker and play Renaissance lute music. I want the plants to hear it, too.
LIFT, THEN WOLF Then I'll go to the gym in my neighborhood. I spend an hour and a half to two hours on a free-weight workout. I like to keep myself in shape. I'm doing OK for an au naturel 60-year-old. Typically I'll eat six jumbo hard-boiled eggs before I go, for protein, but I only eat one or two of the yolks and ditch the rest. I'll also have a bowl of oatmeal. When I leave the gym, I'll go home and wolf down a baked sweet potato and a protein shake.
LOCAL LANDMARKS After that I might make a plan to meet some friends for brunch at Veselka. I've been going to Veselka 35 years or more. I like their cheese blintzes with raspberry sauce. Their pierogies are top notch. The other nice thing is it's Ukrainian, given the current war situation. I make a point of going through Tompkins Square Park on the way. There are a pair of red-tailed hawks that nest in the park, and this time of year it's the best show on earth: The young have fledged from the nest and they're full-sized hawks, but they're still learning and growing up. They're like awkward, gangly teenagers learning how to hunt right in front of your eyes.
COOL DOWN Later in the day is sort of free form. Since it's summer, I might take in a movie, especially if it's a hot day. I like to duck into an air-conditioned theater. I like sci-fi, fantasy and horror, but basically I'll see any movie. I love to lose myself in somebody else's reality for a couple of hours -- just go sit in the dark and eat popcorn.
TESTOSTERONE HIGH There's a strong possibility I'll go to the Eagle after that. It's a gay leather and Levi's bar, and on Sundays they have a rooftop they open up where they do a beer blast. I don't drink beer at all, but they serve liquor, too, so I'll have a cool, refreshing vodka tonic with lime. I go for the congregation of men. It's almost always exclusively men, so you can get a heady high on the testosterone. Everybody's up there schmoozing.
A SLICE AND A SIGHTING I'll go home for dinner. I'll cook something or maybe pick up takeout. I like Gruppo in my neighborhood for the thin-crust pizza. It goes down easy, so you don't feel bloated after eating three slices. John and I will probably eat the pizza -- the meat lover's, drenched in sausage -- in the rooftop garden. We'll also be looking for American kestrels. There's a pair of them that always nest in the vicinity. Sometimes they're perched on a high wire where we can get a good look at them. We're just chilling.
CHECKED OUT We try to watch a show on Sunday nights, but because I start to drift off at 9 p.m., there's mixed results on that. Now we're rewatching "Dark Shadows" from the 1960s. The camp value is off the charts. By about 10 or 10:30 p.m., the war to stay awake has been lost. But before I go to bed, I'll check out the website Joe.My.God. It's basically a news blog from a very progressive, gay perspective. I check it all day, every three or four hours, but I like to check it before I go to bed to make sure I haven't missed anything.

At the same time, the pause in new scripted material provides a moment for many viewers to catch up after the breakneck pace of the so-called Peak TV era, when dozens of shows were premiering each month.
“I have a Netflix queue that is so deep and so long, it would take me months or a year or two to go through it all,” said Dan Leonhardt, a 44-year-old engineer who lives in Copenhagen, Denmark. “And that’s just Netflix! I also have a Max subscription.”
The slowdown will represent a major shift from recent years, when viewers were inundated with a fire hose of content — a record 599 new television scripted premieres last year.
On almost a daily basis, audiences found themselves clicking past new shows on their TVs, often ones they had never heard of, trying to figure out from a one-sentence description whether a series like “Altered Carbon” on Netflix or “The Path” on Hulu was worth their time.
For streaming services, the strategy was straightforward: The more shows they produced, the more chances they had to attract subscribers. The number of people who watched any one show wasn’t as important as the number of people who paid for the service.
So the promise of a constant flow of new stuff became a hallmark of the streaming era. One of the outstanding questions as the labor stalemate goes on has been whether viewers would start to cancel subscriptions to streaming services en masse when fewer new shows and movies became available.
For many, though, a slower output is just fine, giving them time to pick their way through streaming libraries, one missed TV series and movie at a time.
Emily Nidetz, a 41-year-old in Madison, Wisconsin, said she was relieved that production for reality series had not been affected and that there were still plenty of sports to watch. And though she is worried about a slowdown in prestige shows, she said she could always stop by a Facebook community page for The Ringer’s podcast “The Watch” to get some ideas.
“If you go to the Facebook page and write, ‘Hey, I really loved “The Bear,” tell me what to watch,’ there will be like 400 replies,” she said.
Tasha Quinn, a 36-year-old therapist from Chicago, said there was a moment last year when she was so overwhelmed by the conveyor belt of new series that she finally had to take a break. HBO’s “House of the Dragon” was the breaking point.
“I made it through two episodes, and didn’t finish it,” she said. “There was too much hype, and there were a lot of other things coming out at the same time. I was like, nope, I’m too overwhelmed, I’m too overstimulated, I’ll just go back to my comfort shows. I’m going to go watch ‘The Office.’”
Quinn said that the labor disputes had worried her briefly because new episodes of the dystopian workplace drama “Severance” on AppleTV+ would be delayed — but that she then quickly thought of the upside.
“I can take my time without everyone talking about what’s coming next,” she said, adding that she’s currently wrapping up “Succession.”
The length of the labor disputes will determine the length of the disruption. Actors have been on strike since July 14. Writers have been walking picket lines for more than 100 days. Formal talks between the writers and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of the studios, were held Friday for the first time since early May. No talks involving the actors are scheduled.
Third-party researchers believe that most of the streaming services should be well insulated if the strikes last another month or two — though that risk rises the longer production is shut down. The amount of content in their streaming libraries was one reason the studios initially said they could weather the strikes, at least in the short term, a pointed message to writers and actors currently going without paychecks. (For instance, “Suits,” a USA Network show that went off the air in 2019, has recently surged in popularity on Netflix.)
Leaders of the Writers Guild of America, the union that represents thousands of striking screenwriters, recently said it was “disinformation” that the strike would have “no impact because streaming services have libraries and some product in the pipeline.”
“It is not a viable business strategy for these companies to shut down their business for three months — and counting — no matter how much they try and pretend it is,” they said in a note to members.
Many viewers say they support the striking writers and actors. Habboo said she believed they were not being fairly compensated, and “that is a huge bummer.”
Still, when asked if she would cut any of her streaming subscriptions, she was emphatic. “Don’t be ridiculous,” she said. “Canceling is never an option.”
Mel Russo, a 56-year-old yoga teacher who lives in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, said the Max service alone “could keep you busy for the next 10 years, to be honest.”
“I think it’s disgusting what’s going on,” she added. “But I am not in dire straits about it as a watcher and as a lover of entertainment.”
The streaming services seem keen to capitalize. Last month, Netflix rolled out a new banner, “10 Years of Netflix Series,” which presents viewers with dozens of older titles from its library.
Eric Martinez, a 25-year-old video producer who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area, had been a big fan of the HBO series “Euphoria.” But the earliest that show will return for its third season is now 2025, so he went looking for an alternative.
On his Amazon Prime page, Martinez had been seeing a tile for the show “The Boys” for some time. The superhero series was one he thought he had no interest in. But with time on his hands, he finally took the plunge. “I’m enjoying it, and I’m glad I started it,” he said.
Not all the viewers need a new old show to watch.
Brenda Stewart, a 71-year-old Nebraskan, said she and her husband often fired up their Roku and watched reruns of older series including “CSI” and “Murder, She Wrote.” She’s also a big fan of re-watching movies like “The Lion King” and other Disney classics.
Stewart, who has six grandchildren, said it was not uncommon to have “Bluey” episodes playing again and again in her house when the children were over. And, sometimes, it’s not exclusively for the little ones.
“It’s a cartoon series for kids, but I’m not going to lie — it’s also for adults,” she said, laughing. “There’s stuff in there that just makes me chuckle.”

Markets Swing, Then Mostly Even Out: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks swung through shaky trading Thursday following the latest update on inflation across the U.S., only to end up roughly where they started.
The S&P 500 edged up by 1.12, or less than 0.1%, to 4,468.83. It was just the second winning day for the index in the last eight, but it had been up 1.3% in the morning before wobbling between small gains and losses.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 52.79, or 0.2%, to 35,176.15 after giving up most of a morning gain of 455 points. The Nasdaq composite added 15.97, or 0.1%, to 13,737.99.
The morning's highly anticipated report showed U.S. consumers paid prices that were 3.2% higher in July than a year earlier. That's a touch milder than the 3.3% inflation rate economists expected to see and down sharply from last summer's peak above 9%. Beneath the surface, underlying trends for inflation were also within expectations.
The readings bolstered hopes among investors that the Federal Reserve's campaign to grind down inflation is progressing and that it could maybe even be done hiking interest rates. High rates undercut inflation by slowing the entire economy and hurting investment prices, which raise the risk of a recession.
Such hopes helped the S&P 500 rally a big 19.5% through the first seven months of the year. But critics have been saying Wall Street latched too quickly and forcefully onto a belief that inflation will continue to cool, the economy will avoid a recession and the Fed has already hiked rates for the final time this cycle. Several economists said again on Thursday that future moves by the Fed are still uncertain, tamping down some enthusiasm.
The Fed has said it will make upcoming decisions on rates based on what data reports say, particularly those on inflation and the job market. Its main interest rate is already at its highest level in more than two decades.
Thursday's report likely gives the Fed a reason to hold rates steady at its next meeting in September, before it gets more economic data in the runup to the following meeting that ends Nov. 1, according to Gargi Chaudhuri, head of iShares Investment Strategy, Americas.
"Separating the signal from the noise, most of the components of inflation are heading in the right direction," said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. He said if the trends continue, it will be tough to justify another hike to interest rates.
Another report on inflation is looming on Friday, which will show how bad inflation was in July at the wholesale level. Then, more reports on inflation and one more on overall hiring for August will arrive before the Fed's next meeting that ends Sept. 20.
Treasury yields in the bond market initially fell following the inflation data, along with a report that showed slightly more workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than expected.
Fed officials would likely welcome some softening of the job market, which has remained remarkably resilient despite much higher interest rates. That's because a looser job market could remove upward pressure on inflation.
The weekly data on unemployment claims, though, have given false inflection points in the past about the job market, said Mike Loewengart, head of model portfolio construction at Morgan Stanley Global Investment Office. That could mean the cuts to interest rates that investors really desire may be further off than hoped.
"The Fed may leave interest rates unchanged next month, but they're not about to start cutting them," Loewengart said.
Big U.S. companies, meanwhile, continue to report mostly better profits for the spring than analysts expected. That's usually the case, and analysts had particularly low expectations coming into this reporting season. Higher costs for workers and other expenses are broadly eating into profit margins.
The Walt Disney Co. rose 4.9% after saying it would raise prices for some of its streaming services in hopes of boosting profitability. The entertainment giant reported stronger profit for the spring than analysts expected but weaker revenue.
Capri Holdings, which owns the Michael Kors, Versace and Jimmy Choo brands, soared 55.7% as Big Fashion continues to consolidate.
Tapestry, the company behind luxury handbag and accessories retailer Coach, said it was buying the company for roughly $ 8.5 billion. The deal would put it in better position to take on big European rivals, such as LVMH. Tapestry fell 15.9%.
In the bond market, Treasury yields rose in the afternoon following an auction by the U.S. government of 30-year Treasury bonds. Yields have been generally rising recently amid concerns about heavy borrowing by the federal government. Those higher yields add pressure on the stock market.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.09% from 4.01% late Wednesday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.
The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, ticked up to 4.81% from 4.80% late Wednesday.
In stock markets abroad, indexes were mostly higher in Europe and Asia.
Stocks in China held relatively steady after U.S. President Joe Biden signed an order to block and regulate high-tech U.S.-based investments going toward China.

Super Pets, a Shape-Shifter and a Ladybug: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This month's picks include a stereotype-defying shape-shifter, superpowered shelter pets and the newest "Guardians of the Galaxy" adventure.
'Nimona'
Watch it on Netflix.
Nimona is a shape-shifter, a monster, a misunderstood hellion with a heart of gold. Voiced by Chloë Grace Moretz, the title character busts into a futuristic world where knights defend the castle and the powerful might not be as benevolent as they'd like the citizens to believe. Based on a best-selling graphic novel by ND Stevenson and directed by Nick Bruno and Troy Quane (who also co-directed "Spies in Disguise"), this 2023 animated feature from Netflix gives young children a mile-a-minute main character who slides between "good guy" and "bad guy" status, defying the usual stereotypes. Stevenson has called the story a transgender allegory, and the L.G.B.T.Q. representation is a welcome change from the usual kids' movie universes, where knights fall in love with princesses, not with each other. Here, Riz Ahmed voices Ballister Boldheart, a knight who has been wrongly accused of murdering Queen Valerin (Lorraine Toussaint). Ballister reluctantly allows Nimona to help him take down a corrupt system, prove his innocence and reunite with his partner, Ambrosius Goldenloin (Eugene Lee Yang). As a character, Nimona has zero chill and might prove a little tough for adults to watch for any length of time, but my son was entertained by the character's constant motion, chaotic energy and what-will-come-next transformations.
'Miraculous: Ladybug & Cat Noir, The Movie'
Watch it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Many youngsters will already be familiar with the hit French series "Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir," about two Parisian teen superheroes named Marinette (voiced by Cristina Vee for the English-speaking cast) and Adrien (Bryce Papenbrook), who secretly transform into Ladybug and Cat Noir to save their city from villains. They're members of The Miraculous, a group of protectors who vanquish evil all over the world. This time, the superheroes get nearly two hours of screen time to join forces and stop the evil Hawk Moth (Keith Silverstein) from unleashing destruction throughout the City of Light. Directed by Jeremy Zag, who co-wrote the screenplay with Bettina López Mendoza and also wrote the songs, the 2023 movie amps up the action, with plenty of scenes in which Ladybug and Cat Noir fly over Parisian landmarks and battle the bad guys. There are musical numbers, moments of valor, and enough silly humor and flirty banter between the real-life teenagers and their alter egos to keep elementary-age kids watching. The vibrant reds and purples that make the series stand out visually are on full display, and the same girl power theme that defines the series carries over to the film.
'Heroes of the Golden Mask'
Rent it on Amazon Prime and Vudu.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In this Arcana Studios 2023 production directed by Sean Patrick O'Reilly, an orphan named Charlie (voiced by Kiefer O'Reilly) is trying his best to survive on the mean streets of his city. Just as Charlie is about to get nabbed by the cops for another petty crime, a door opens and a strange figure offers him a quick escape in the form of a magic portal. Charlie hops through, and he's transported to an ancient Chinese kingdom called Sanxingdui. He meets an unlikely group of golden-masked superheroes who tell Charlie they need his help defeating a ruthless enemy set on conquering the kingdom. At first Charlie schemes to help the heroes with the secret intention of taking the golden masks, but lessons are learned and Charlie discovers that money and greed aren't the most important things in life. The animation looks a little like a low-budget video game, and the writing and performances are definitely not awards-season worthy, but Patton Oswalt voices a blue ogre named Aesop, Ron Perlman voices Kunyi, and Christopher Plummer, before his death, voiced the character Rizzo. It's a bit of a mishmash, but if your kid is craving swordplay, winged tigers and dragons that look like they mated with a moose, give this one a try.
'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3'
Watch it on Disney+.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The final installment of the director James Gunn's "Guardians of the Galaxy" trilogy, released in May, might not go down as the best of the three, but it should entertain older elementary school and middle school kids who've come to love Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldaña), Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and Drax (Dave Bautista). When we meet back up with the Marvel gang, Star-Lord is grieving Gamora, who died in "Avengers: Infinity War." Never fear, though! Gamora (sort of) returns to the crew in the form of a time-traveling variant, but this Gamora has no memory of her relationship with Peter. The story largely centers on Rocket, and the Guardians' attempts to save his life and take down the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji), an evil scientist who created Rocket and who is now intent on mutiny. Cooper brings some genuine emotion to Rocket's journey, and Iwuji portrays a formidable villain.
'DC League of Super-Pets'
Watch it on Max.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
One could easily imagine this movie being pitched in a conference room: An animated superhero movie, but about their pets! The delightful simplicity of it would be tough to pass up. Here, we have Dwayne Johnson voicing Superman's dog, Krypto, a pup whose favorite chew toy is a little squeaky Batman doll. Youngsters won't care about the voices behind the adorable super-pets, but Kevin Hart, Keanu Reeves, Kate McKinnon, Natasha Lyonne and Marc Maron make a formidable cast. Krypto was sent to Earth as a puppy to look after Superman (voiced by John Krasinski), so the two have a sweet bond that might make both children and adults feel a little weepy because dogs are the best. Krypto can fight crime, but he's a misfit when it comes to relating to non-superhero dogs. When Superman proposes marriage to Lois Lane (Olivia Wilde), he takes Krypto to a shelter to meet some other dogs, so he won't feel like a third wheel, and just like that, a league of super-pets is formed. With a screenplay by the "Lego Batman Movie" writers Jared Stern and John Whittington, this 2022 charmer, directed by Stern and Sam Levine, has enough action, sweetness and humor to warrant multiple viewings.

After a Lull, the Rally Is Back on Track: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/after-lull-rally-is-back-on-track/docview/2847191083/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks climbed on Monday as Wall Street's big rally for the year kicked back into gear after a brief hiccup.
The S&P 500 rose 40.41, or 0.9 percent, to 4,518.44 and recovered more than a third of its loss from last week. That was its first losing week in four and just its third in the last 12.
The Dow Jones industrial average rallied 407.51 points, or 1.2 percent, to 35,473.13, and the Nasdaq composite added 85.16, or 0.6 percent, to 13,994.4.
Berkshire Hathaway, the company run by Warren Buffett, rose 3.6 percent and was a major force lifting the market after it reported stronger profit and revenue for the spring than analysts had expected. The pharmaceutical company Viatris also rose after its results topped forecasts. Viatris's stock climbed 3.9 percent.
The stronger-than-expected reports helped offset a 3.8 percent drop for Tyson, whose results for the latest quarter fell far short of analysts' expectations. Tyson said it would close four chicken facilities as it tried to cut costs.
Corporate profits have mostly been beating forecasts as the season for reporting results from April through June enters its tail end. Nearly four out of five companies in the S&P 500 have exceeded expectations so far, according to FactSet. But companies are still on track to report their sharpest drop in profit since the summer of 2020, when the pandemic was pummeling the global economy.
Besides profit reports from some media giants like the Walt Disney Co. and Fox, the coming week also features highly anticipated reports on inflation.
Inflation has been the key to Wall Street's big moves in recent years after soaring to its worst level in generation. Since hitting a peak last summer, inflation has been cooling steadily. That has raised hopes that the Federal Reserve may be done with its drastic increases to interest rates.
The central bank uses higher rates to smother inflation by bluntly slowing the entire economy and hurting prices for investments. It has quickly pulled its federal funds rate to the highest level in more than two decades, up from virtually zero early last year.
Inflation has come down from more than 9 percent last summer to 3 percent in June. But many economists and professional investors say the toughest part may still be ahead as the Fed tries to get inflation down toward its 2 percent target.
Sticky inflation could mean that Wall Street has latched too quickly onto the hope that rate increases are over and that the economy will have a soft landing. If that is the case, the S&P 500's rally of 19.5 percent through the year's first seven months could also be overdone, as critics suggest.
Some recent earnings reports may be hinting at the continuing risk of a mild recession, as the Fed's rate increases make their way through the system, said Amanda Agati, chief investment officer for PNC Financial Services Asset Management Group.
She points to Chipotle, Starbucks and Apple, which all reported revenue either below or right at analysts' expectations for the spring. They are "very much a part of the daily life of upper middle-income consumers," she said, "yet their sales were weak."
Oil prices have perked up recently. The price of a barrel of U.S. crude added roughly $ 10 through July to top $ 80, though it slipped 88 cents to $ 81.94 on Monday.
A remarkably resilient job market may also be putting a floor under inflation by giving households fuel to keep spending and keep inflationary forces alive. A report last week showed that wages for workers rose more in July than expected, though hiring was cooler than forecast.
On Thursday, the U.S. government will release the latest monthly update on the inflation that consumers are feeling, and economists are forecasting it will show a 3.3 percent rise in prices from year-ago levels. That would be an acceleration from June.

'Barbie' Hits $1 Billion at Box Office, Studio Says: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: No movie in Warner Bros. history has sold so many tickets so fast, the studio said of the movie directed by Greta Gerwig.
In the history of Hollywood, very few people -- 28 to be precise, all men -- have had the sole directing credit on a billion-dollar movie.
Make that 28 men and one woman: Greta Gerwig.
"Barbie," directed by Ms. Gerwig from a script she wrote with her partner, Noah Baumbach, will finish the weekend with more than $ 1 billion in ticket sales at the global box office, according to Warner Bros. No movie in the studio's 100-year history has sold so many tickets so fast, said Jeff Goldstein, Warner's president of domestic distribution. As of Sunday, "Barbie" had been playing in theaters for 17 days. ("Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2" was previously the fastest to $ 1 billion, at 19 days.)
Ms. Gerwig could not be reached, according to a spokeswoman. Warner Bros. was giddy. "PINK FEVER," Mr. Goldstein wrote in a text message. "Barbie" was No. 1 in the United States and Canada for the third weekend in a row, collecting $ 53 million, for a new domestic total of $ 459.4 million.
"Barbie" once again disproved a stubborn Hollywood myth: that "girl" movies -- films made by women, starring women and aimed at women -- are limited in their appeal. An old movie industry maxim holds that women will go to a "guy" movie but not vice versa.
Other films have challenged that notion, including "Wonder Woman," which was directed by Patty Jenkins and starred Gal Gadot. It collected $ 823 million worldwide for Warner Bros. in 2017. "Captain Marvel," directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck and starring Brie Larson, took in $ 1.1 billion for Disney in 2019. "Twilight," based on Stephenie Meyer's novel and starring Kristen Stewart, was directed by Catherine Hardwicke. It collected $ 408 million for Lionsgate in 2008, starting a blockbuster franchise.
But studios have continued to be hesitant. Before "Barbie" was released, even some Warner Bros. executives challenged the wisdom of giving Ms. Gerwig so much money -- about $ 145 million -- to make such a pink movie. The studio signed Ms. Gerwig and Margot Robbie, who played the title role, to contracts that did not include provisions for sequels.
"Women-centered movies have been undervalued, in large part because studios have so few women in senior leadership roles," said Ana-Christina Ramón, an author of studies about Hollywood hiring that are published annually by the University of California, Los Angeles. "The men in those positions are often reliant on past experience and stereotypes -- Oh, that didn't work before so let's not risk it again."
The success of "Barbie" belongs to hundreds of people, both men and women. Ynon Kreiz, the chief executive of Mattel, allowed Ms. Gerwig to satirize his company and No. 1 toy. Toby Emmerich, a former chairman of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group, gave "Barbie" a green light. (Mr. Emmerich stepped down last year. His successors, Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy, shepherded "Barbie" through postproduction and release.)
Josh Goldstine, Warner's president of worldwide movie marketing, backed "Barbie" with a thundering promotional campaign.
But it was women who, especially early on, pushed "Barbie" ahead in the face of skepticism. "If ever there was an example of why Hollywood needs more women in positions of power, this was it," Ms. Ramón said.
Those women include Robbie Brenner, a "Barbie" producer and the head of Mattel Films -- the executive "who rescued 'Barbie' from development hell," in the words of Vulture, the culture and entertainment news site. After arriving at Mattel in 2018, Ms. Brenner, who was nominated for an Academy Award for producing "Dallas Buyers Club" (2013), teamed with Ms. Robbie, who came onto the project as a producer in addition to lead actress. Ms. Robbie knew Ms. Gerwig, and convinced her to write the script. Later, Ms. Gerwig decided to direct "Barbie."
Courtenay Valenti, Warner's former president of production, played one of the most important roles. She has been credited with seeing promise in "Barbie" from the earliest stage -- recognizing that it was not (just) a commercial for a polarizing toy, but an idea that could reverberate through the culture. Ms. Valenti fought for Ms. Gerwig to have a budget big enough to execute on her vision. (Ms. Valenti left Warner Bros. in February to become the head of film, streaming and theatrical at Amazon Studios and MGM.)
"Barbie" ended up as the biggest box-office hit of Ms. Gerwig's career, by a moonshot, cementing her status as one of Hollywood's young "name" filmmakers -- directors who mainstream ticket buyers recognize as delivering singular work. (Jordan Peele is another.) Ms. Gerwig previously directed "Little Women" (2019) and "Lady Bird" (2017). She has been nominated for three Oscars.

Full text: An unforgettable moment as a child was when I saw Missy Elliott take off her head in the "One Minute Man" video, and that just made me, like, go crazy.
I don't want to hear Barney anymore, you know what I'm saying? I don't want to hear Disney movies music anymore. I just automatically got into hip-hop.
My female cousins that were older than me, they always listened to Lil' Kim, Foxy, all the girls that was out at the moment. My mom used to be like, "Don't be playing that too much around the kids." Then I got into Trina's type of music. Trina makes like, you know, a nasty, freak nasty type of music. Lil' Kim does freak nasty too, but I feel like they have different types of style. The route for me was more of a Trina route. It's crazy because I'm a New Yorker, but I was always into that Trina and the Khia and the Jacki-O type of vibe.
As a teen, it just made me be like, yeah, "I wanna be [expletive] like them." I started doing music when I was 23, but I was listening to these girls at 15, 16, 17, 18. So the personality that their music gave me stuck to me.
At the time, I just stopped stripping, so I was very much still in that world. My first song, "Washpoppin'," it's like, "I need all my money makers bring that cash out/I need all my D-boys to bring that cash out." It was get money type of music. And then I also was making music for the gangsters because I felt like I was just such a gangster-ass little bitch.
My manager, he used to have long conversations with me like, how do you feel? I used to be like, oh, you know, I feel overwhelmed, sometimes I feel really tired. And then he would ask me weird questions like, so how do your boyfriend make you feel? How do you feel about love? How do you feel about your past relationships? And then I would have a conversation with him about my past relationships and my traumas. And then he'll be like, OK, so put that on your music. And that's when I started to talk more about other things than just the things that I was doing in my past, like gang [expletive], street [expletive] and stripper [expletive].
I went from $ 20,000 a show and then after "Bodak Yellow," I went to 100. And then like two, three months later I went to 200, 300, 400, 500. Then in 2018, I was getting booked for like $ 700,000, $ 800,000. And then millions. I haven't put out an album in five years and the numbers just keep going up.
When I bought my mom a house, that meant a lot to me. When I bought my house with my husband, that meant a lot to me. When I bought another house ... damn, I bought a lot of houses.
But it also do be the little things, right? I just bought this playground set for my kids and it's huge. It looks insane. And I spent in the 20 thousands for it. Of course it's not my biggest purchase ever, but this is what I work hard for, for my kids. Overly spending on your kids doesn't mean that you're a great parent, but it makes you feel good. It makes you feel like that you're living your childhood dream.
It's everything. The people you meet, the access you have. The biggest things to the smallest things, you know what I'm saying? Like being able to go to Carbone whenever you want. Being able to skip lines everywhere is the greatest thing.

The Supreme Court Is Conservative, Not MAGA: [Op-Ed]

Full text: If you ask folks on the left to describe the contemporary Supreme Court, you may hear one or more common words used to describe it: "rogue" or "extremist" or "illegitimate" or "broken." But when I look at the court, I see something quite different: the last federal bastion of the pre-Trump right.
The court is definitely not liberal. But it's equally clear that it is not MAGA. Even as it has inevitably rendered decisions that outrage progressives, it has also blocked much of the Trumpian populist project, and it has done important work to preserve the fundamental institutions of American democracy.
The Supreme Court is in many ways a throwback to the status quo before Donald Trump descended his escalator. Prior to Trump's arrival on the political scene, there were of course abundant disagreements, many of them heated, between the American right and left. But there was also broad agreement -- imperfect, of course, and subject to critique from both sides -- on the importance of facts and logic and consistency and precedent. Liberals and conservatives may have been ideological competitors or even combatants, but they mostly agreed on a set of rules or, better, "norms."
To understand the contrast between the MAGA movement and the current Supreme Court, one has to understand the profound practical and philosophical differences between the two. The MAGA approach to the power of the law can be conveyed in a single sentence: It is to be used to reward friends and punish enemies, consequences be damned. Or to put it another way, MAGA jurisprudence demands victory and then relishes the liberal outrage that follows.
There are two cardinal examples. The first is obvious -- the legal fight to steal the 2020 election, now the foundation of Trump's most serious indictment. At the center of that fight were two truly extraordinary legal theories: the "independent state legislature doctrine" that argued the Constitution essentially gave state lawmakers the power to control federal elections in their states, including the selection of presidential electors, immune from state judicial review; and the former Chapman University law school dean John Eastman's novel interpretation of the 12th Amendment that would have enabled Vice President Mike Pence to declare Trump the winner of the election even without obtaining 270 electoral votes.
The second example of the MAGA approach to the law is represented by Gov. Ron DeSantis's campaign against the First Amendment in Florida. In his bid to run for president as a more ruthlessly efficient version of Trump, the governor, a graduate of Harvard Law School, has trampled free speech in his efforts to punish Disney for dissent, regulate social media moderation and ban mandatory corporate diversity training that expresses disfavored opinions about race. He's also restricted speech about race and racial equity in public university classrooms.
While the Supreme Court has not yet heard challenges to DeSantis's authoritarianism (lower courts have blocked enforcement of multiple Florida statutory provisions), it not only refused to hear MAGA challenges to Joe Biden's victory, but has also rejected a number of aggressive Republican efforts to expand state power over elections. This year, a clear majority of the court gutted the independent state legislature doctrine, and it struck down an Alabama redistricting map that heavily favored Republicans as an unlawful racial gerrymander. If that weren't enough to signal the court's independence from Trumpism, in 2022 it granted the Democratic majority in the House access to Trump's tax returns.
Yes, the court is conservative, and so it has offered rulings that dismay and even enrage liberals. Chief among these was the ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade. But conservative legal critiques of Roe far predate Trump. In fact, Roe was so broad that a liberal jurist no less renowned than Ruth Bader Ginsburg once described it as "breathtaking" in scope. If anything, Dobbs was a less revolutionary ruling than Roe. After all, by declaring abortion a constitutional right in Roe, the court removed the legality of abortion from the democratic process. Dobbs returned the question to voters, who now have a chance to cast their ballots based on the policies they prefer.
I do not wish to idealize the contemporary Supreme Court. It is still a human institution and, as such, subject to human flaws. The recent ethics controversies at the court -- whether they involve private airplane flights with wealthy friends or other conduct that is technically legal or was within existing ethics rules -- are not the subject of this essay. But my thoughts broadly mirror those of Judge Michael Ponsor, who critiqued the justices' sometimes casual approach to potential conflicts thus in The Times: "You don't just stay inside the lines; you stay well inside the lines."
I have attempted to describe what the court is not. But to understand how the court can sometimes enrage both liberals and the Trump right, we have to understand what the court is. If the MAGA approach to the law can be summed up as "reward friends and punish enemies, consequences be damned," this court's jurisprudence is better summed up as "apply the text and original public meaning of the law, consequences be considered."
This is the approach to the law I learned as a young member of the Federalist Society in law school in 1991. It is the approach that's dominated the conservative legal movement since the Federalist Society was founded in 1982. And by taking that approach, the court has made itself one of the last remaining strongholds of pre-Trump conservative philosophy on the American right.
In other words, the best way to analyze the current court isn't through a partisan lens, but rather through one grounded in legal theory, specifically by understanding the tension between originalism and incrementalism. A purely originalist approach (the term "textualist" is closely related) might interpret the law based solely or principally on its text -- or the original public meaning of the text, which often involves a historical inquiry into the understanding of the law when it was passed -- and impose a ruling with little regard to broader context or practical consequences.
An incrementalist (sometimes called "institutionalist" or "consequentialist") approach, by contrast, seeks to make narrow rulings and thus avoid disruption; it is respectful of precedent and prefers the nudge to the shove. There is no hard and fast line between these philosophies, of course. Incrementalists can also be originalists, but the former tendency will mean that they prefer to move more slowly, and are more apt to let respect for precedent influence their rulings, even if there is a potential conflict between the court's current jurisprudence and the plain meaning of the text.
Originalism is generally deemed to be a conservative legal philosophy, whereas incrementalism can have a more universal appeal. Indeed, as I alluded to above, one of the more famous defenses of incrementalism comes from Ginsburg, hardly anyone's idea of a conservative. During a 1993 lecture at New York University, Ginsburg approvingly quoted Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, who said that "judges do and must legislate," but they should do so "only interstitially" -- i.e., slowly and deliberately.
Ginsburg prophetically noted that "doctrinal limbs too swiftly shaped, experience teaches, may prove unstable," and applied this analysis to Roe v. Wade. She described Roe as an outlier compared to the court's jurisprudence on sex discrimination, and wondered aloud about an alternative reality in which the Roe court had struck down only the most "extreme" anti-abortion statutes without displacing "virtually every state law then in force." Even as she continued to support Roe, Ginsburg offered what was arguably an incrementalist critique of the ruling.
It's increasingly clear that an originalist versus incrementalist framework is the clearest way to evaluate the three full Supreme Court terms since Amy Coney Barrett was confirmed in 2020 and secured the 6-3 conservative majority.
The first term, in 2020-2021, was very much incrementalist. The paradigmatic case was Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, which challenged Philadelphia's decision to exclude Catholic Social Services from participating in the city's foster care program for refusing to certify same-sex couples as foster parents. (The Catholic agency believed such certifications would violate its religious beliefs regarding marriage.) The court's opinion in favor of the agency was both unanimous and quite narrow. It explicitly declined to issue a more sweeping ruling that would have overruled a 1990 case called Employment Division v. Smith, a controversial (and many conservatives believe, mistaken) opinion that weakened constitutional protections for the free exercise of religion.
The second term was far more originalist, with two sweeping rulings serving as emblematic: Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization and New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen. In Dobbs, a divided court reversed Roe -- a ruling that, much like Roe itself, sent shock waves rippling across the political landscape. In Bruen, the court not only struck down New York's handgun carry permitting system, it went well beyond a narrow finding to issue a ruling that dictated the analytical framework for all gun rights cases going forward -- a "text, history and tradition" test that's already been used to strike down gun control laws across the country.
And what of the most recent term? The court swung back in the incrementalist direction and, in two of its most consequential cases, decisively rejected aggressive right-wing arguments. In Allen v. Milligan, the court didn't merely reject Alabama's gerrymandered voting maps, it rejected the state's attempt to reverse decades of case law by changing the legal test for determining whether a gerrymander violates the Voting Rights Act. In so doing, the court preserved the legal mechanisms for scrutinizing historically discriminatory and highly racially polarized states and localities.
In Moore v. Harper, as I noted above, the court decisively rejected the core of the so-called independent legislature doctrine, a MAGA legal argument that rested on a context-free, ahistoric and hyper-literalist interpretation of constitutional provisions that would essentially grant state legislatures the power to ignore voters and unilaterally choose how to apportion their states' electoral votes.
Even the most contentious cases of the entire term -- 303 Creative v. Elenis, which upheld the right of a wedding website designer to refuse to design websites for same-sex weddings, and the two Students for Fair Admissions cases, which struck down the Harvard and University of North Carolina race-based affirmative action programs -- were relatively modest in scope.
In the first case, Colorado had stipulated in advance -- that is, agreed on the underlying facts -- that 303 Creative's websites were "expressive" and that 303 Creative had no problem serving gay customers if they wanted help designing other types of websites. (Colorado's decision to stipulate to these key facts is puzzling, to say the least.) The case was therefore nothing more than a straightforward application of at least 80 years of First Amendment precedent prohibiting the state from forcing citizens to speak in favor of ideas they oppose.
The Harvard case, especially when read alongside the voting-rights decision in Allen v. Milligan, does not eviscerate race-conscious remedies for documented racial discrimination. Instead, it states that the process must be individual and not categorical. As Chief Justice John Roberts wrote at the end of his majority opinion, "A benefit to a student who overcame racial discrimination, for example, must be tied to that student's courage and determination."
Indeed, if there's a common thread between Allen and Harvard, it's a judicial rejection of invidious racial discrimination. Alabama's long and uncontested history of systemic racism has made race-conscious remedies necessary. Likewise, it was Harvard's own history of discrimination against Asian applicants that sorely and perhaps decisively undermined its argument for affirmative action. In that sense, Harvard approached the court in Alabama's shoes, with its case stained by a clear record of racial injustice.
Going forward, the grounds for debate and the path to forging Supreme Court majorities is clear. Originalist or textualist arguments empower meaningful change. Incrementalist or institutionalist ones offer a path of greater restraint. And both conservative and liberal advocates can apply those principles to win at court.
Let's examine, for example, one of the progressive legal movement's most important recent victories -- the court's 2020 opinion in Bostock v. Clayton County, which held that employers who fire employees simply for being gay or transgender violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Even before the decision, when I read the transcript of the oral argument I was struck by the skill of the advocates for the gay and transgender plaintiffs. They knew the court would focus on both the text of the statute and the consequences of its ruling. So they took care to make two key arguments: that the text was on their side, and also that the court could rule for the L.G.B.T. Q. plaintiffs without drastic repercussions for American law.
I spoke to David Cole, the national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union and one of the advocates in a case consolidated with Bostock, and he described an approach that was both textualist and institutionalist. "We felt that if we were going to win," he said, "we were going to win on textualist grounds." At the same time, however, he sought to assuage incrementalist concerns that the textual reading would have disruptive effects on society at large. He won over not only Justice Neil Gorsuch, one of the more purely textualist justices, but Roberts as well, the conservative majority's most ardent incrementalist voice. The court's decision was 6-3 in favor of the L.G.B.T. plaintiffs.
Cases such as Bostock, or Allen, or Moore -- as well as those like Dobbs and Bruen -- are emblematic of the conservative legal philosophies that shaped my own philosophy and career. The best conservative jurists emphasize reasoning over outcome. Facts matter. Evidence matters. Their minds are open to litigants' arguments. They do not simply decide that their side or tribe will win and then reason backward to get the result they desire.
It's also important to understand that the six conservative justices are not an undifferentiated bloc. In the most recent term, Roberts, Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh were most frequently in the court's majority. But the liberals Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor were more frequently in the majority than the conservatives Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas.
Indeed, it is a notable irony that Alito and Thomas are consistently the two justices most revered in the MAGA G.O.P. even though they ascended to the high court, respectively, 11 and 26 years before Trump assumed the presidency. This alignment -- and the corollary that Trump's own appointees have proven less reliably Trump-y -- has not gone unnoticed in MAGA world. Befitting his strategy of outflanking Trump on the right, DeSantis told the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that he will "do better" than the former president on judicial nominations. He said he respected Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Barrett, but he would look for justices more like Thomas and Alito. In other words, not even arguably the most prominent self-appointed heir to the MAGA movement believes that Trump's appointees are sufficiently MAGA.
In the recent Apple TV+ series "Ted Lasso," the title character explains that goldfish have only a "10-second memory." I fear that much of the analysis of the Supreme Court is goldfish analysis, dominated not by a holistic understanding of all the court's jurisprudence, but rather by the joy or anger generated by its most recent important case. When Senator Josh Hawley roundly condemned the conservative legal movement from the right as a failure after Bostock, he was being a goldfish. Likewise, when progressive critics call the court "rogue" or "illegitimate" after the most recent round of disagreeable outcomes -- even just days after the same court handed down Moore or Allen -- they too are being goldfish.
That's not to say that taking a longer view will yield universal agreement or respect. Well before the emergence of Trump and the MAGA movement, the right and left had their share of sharp disagreements. But the conservative court's legal philosophies stand squarely within America's legal tradition, especially when matched with appropriate judicial restraint. Collectively, these values provide a basis for both sides to make their case, and they represent the core of a judicial philosophy that has proved it can transcend partisanship. "Conservative" is not a synonym for "Trumpist," and with each new term, the court demonstrates that pre-Trump ideas and pre-Trump values have life left in them yet.

Over five decades, hip-hop has grown from a new art form to a culture-defining superpower. In their own words, 50 influential voices chronicle its evolution.
—
KOOL MOE DEE
The first time I remember being exposed to what we’re calling hip-hop now is Lovebug Starski on the mic at the Renaissance in New York, 138th and 7th Avenue. It was something I felt in my inner being. There was something going on inside me that said, I wanted to be a part of what that was.
Being a child of Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali, that whole revolutionary thought process was part of my DNA. I was pretty let down that the draft was done by the time I was 12, because I so looked forward to the day that I could be like Muhammad Ali. I was looking forward to not enlisting. So when I saw hip-hop, I had the same feeling: I’ll have a platform. That was my primary thought: I get the chance to do my Malcolm X thing on a mic one day. Hip-hop gave me the first inkling of that being possible.
Melle Mel was the first person that made me think that it was possible to take the lyrical content to where I wanted to take it. But Earth, Wind & Fire and Stevie Wonder gave me the inkling that you could actually put lyrics together and make an impact beyond just the music. “Songs in the Key of Life” was the most double-entendre, witty thought process, just in terms of the poetry in the title alone. And Maurice White — forget about it. When I heard the record “Fantasy” — “You will find/Other kind/That has been in search for you” — that was absolute peak metaphor for me. The fact that they were doing that kind of poetry on top of music was my actual genuine, genuine, genuine, genuine inspiration. I would say a calling, quite frankly.
I could not believe that Earth, Wind & Fire felt similar about me that I did about them. We were doing a cruise a couple years back, and they were rushing through the galleys to try to get to my show. When Verdine White broke down the difference in my cadence from the average MC? I was floating.
At one point, we were being belittled and looked down upon: That’s that bibbity-bop hip-hop stuff. But when Public Enemy and Chuck D got to be the center of attention, I was proud to say I was a rapper. “I do what they do.” Public Enemy took us beyond where most people thought we could take it. I make a little analogy that hip-hop has given Black America the chance to experience what white privilege feels like.
SCARFACE
I think my earliest memories were hearing the Sugarhill Gang’s “Rapper’s Delight” in 1979, and then the Soul Sonic Force, “Planet Rock.” I remember Kurtis Blow had a record called “Way Out West” — “Way out West from way back East/Coming from the place you’d expect the least/There came a stranger dressed in black/from a Harlem town a long way back/Had a Stetson hat with a band of gold.” I still remember it ’til this day. That’s the impact Kurtis Blow had on hip-hop.
I started going up to New York in my early teenage years, and started hearing and seeing the real elements of hip-hop, listening to WBLS on the radio. My cousin from uptown would send tapes to me, so I would always have the new hip-hop first.
In Houston, there was a hip-hop show called “Kidz Jamm” that came on 90.9. FM. There was also a local DJ by the name of Darryl Scott. That’s how we really got turned on to hip-hop. The first local artist I heard was Captain Jack. He was a DJ, and he made a record called “Jack It Up.”
I was a DJ first. My main influence was Jam Master Jay, the ultimate of all DJs. Then came the DJ that could rap: Grandmaster Dee from Whodini, right? I could rap, too, so I knew if I ever had to battle Grandmaster Dee I was going to douse his ass. That’s what I prepared my whole DJ career on: battling Grandmaster Dee.
I liked to cut Eric B. & Rakim’s “Eric B. Is President” and the Beastie Boys’ “Hold It Now, Hit It.” I was more the backspin, cut and spin DJ — I got into learning how to transform later. But as time went on I started moving more towards writing rhymes and producing.
The early Geto Boys made a song called “Car Freak,” and I thought they were famous, you know? But I didn’t know the realities of the music business until I got with Jukebox, Ready Red, Bushwick Bill and Willie D. Prince Johnny C had left the group, and when Jukebox left, it was just me, Will and Bill. That’s when we made “Grip It! On That Other Level.” Me and Willie did all the writing, we wrote for Bill.
I always tell people that I’m a hip-hop hybrid of Ice Cube, Chuck D and Big Daddy Kane. I wanted to be able to tell a story like Cube. I wanted to be very lyrical like Kane. And I wanted to have an in-your-face delivery like Chuck. As much respect as I have for Nas and Jay-Z, if it hadn’t been for that previous level of intensity in rhyming, I wouldn’t be me.
I’m just thankful that LL Cool J talked to my mom on the telephone during the New Music Seminar. This was when I first started rapping, a few months before “Mind Playing Tricks on Me.” This was the first time the Geto Boys got the chance to perform in New York, had to be around ’90. I don’t know what my mom and LL talked about, but I was on a pay phone with my mom and I was just so glad. And the Geto Boys got booed!
I think there were some artists booing us. Some of the other group members think it was probably A Tribe Called Quest. Nah, I’m just messing with you, because me and Q-Tip are cool as hell. That’s where we met, out in New York. And we toured together, too.
Q-Tip and I have formed a really dope friendship. He’ll just call and say, “Man, I’m just calling to tell you I love you, bro …” Well, I love you, too, Tip. That’s a very different matchup.
Being somebody that was born with this manic depressive mindset and just a sick disorder mentally, I found an outlet through my music. You saw me succeed. You saw me fail. I know that hip-hop saved me. But at the same time it took away from me being a good father, a good husband, a good son, a good uncle. The music stole me from everything that I should have been, but it still made me everything that I could have been, if that makes sense.
EVE
Hip-hop was always around me at a very young age. I had a big family that all lived together and my aunt loved LL Cool J — like, looooved . She always played his music around the house and went to every concert when he came to Philadelphia.
The neighborhood we lived in always had block parties with DJs in the summertime, ’84, ’85. Meredith Street — they’ve since torn them down, but we used to call it “down bottom,” 46th Street. You’re kind of in your own world when you live in the projects. Everybody knows everybody. So it’s a celebration of the summer and food and culture. But at the same time, it was not always the safest.
The music was full on Salt-N-Pepa, Queen Latifah, Fresh Prince — he wasn’t Will Smith then, he was just Fresh Prince. Along with tons of soul music. My biological father is a DJ, so there was music on that side as well.
A lot of the reason I went into hip-hop was the females. What I saw in them was women who were holding their own up against the boys, but still celebrating their femininity. MC Lyte’s “Cappucino” — I can totally remember the video. What was I, 10? I thought she was so damn fly. She had this long black coat on, but then her hair was stacked and shaved in the back. I wanted to get my hair cut like hers.
I always sang and I would write poems. But it wasn’t really until ABC came out — Another Bad Creation — when I was like, I want to start rapping. I formed a little girl’s group then — DGP, Dope Girl Posse — and we would do a lot of their songs, En Vogue, Color Me Badd. We did every talent show in Philly.
But I didn’t really start getting real serious until I got to high school, and I was very much a battle rapper. I was the girl who loved to get in a cypher. I started listening more to Lil’ Kim, Biggie, and my sound switched up. Philly is definitely different. We were known for being battle rappers, but a lot of Philly style is kind of more backpack and I just didn’t gravitate towards that.
It was fast and punchy, go-for-the-jugular. Because I used to battle rap against dudes all the time, I would just go at it and hurt their egos. It was basically just talking [expletive]. I always had stuff in the chamber. It’s very easy battling high school boys, ego-wise. It’s literally the truth: “You’re broke and you live with your mom.” Talk about their [expletive] size, and then you’re done.
It was always important for me just to be good — not good for a girl. I looked at those cyphers as honing my skills. I never turned one down. I went to Martin Luther King High School, and I’d cut and have like two or three lunches just to battle people. In the cafeteria, by the locker, the back stairs, whatever. On the weekends, South Street, there would just be cyphers on the corner. My full name was pretty much “Eve, That Girl With the Blonde Hair That Can Rap.”
Once I stepped in the studio I realized what a song was. We used to work with this one producer, Marv, who was really good at structure. I just wanted to do 24 bars and he was like, Bro, that’s not a song — you need a hook. We paid him when we could. Maybe bring him a bag of weed or something.
My first deal was with Dr. Dre. I auditioned for his A&R at the time, Mike Lynn. My managers were like, we’re going to put this beat on and you just rap. And I did. He literally called Dre right after I was finished, like, Yo, I think we found our girl.
When I was signed to Dre, one of his producers who I did my demo with was like, Yo, you have to meet this kid DMX. This was way before I knew what Ruff Ryders was. It just so happened we were under the same umbrella of Interscope. And after Dre dropped me, Jimmy Iovine said I’d be great with Ruff Ryders.
I just wasn’t happy waiting in the wings. I started getting on Dre’s nerves. They didn’t know the direction to put me in, but I’m very happy I got dropped, because once I got with Ruff Ryders, it was my boot camp. I thought I knew how to write a song — not really. I was told to slow down my flow. I needed to be humbled, and being dropped will do that. That being said, I went on to make some of my greatest records — the song I won a Grammy for [“Let Me Blow Ya Mind”] — with Dr. Dre. That was when I knew who I was, though.
I had a lot of opinions about how I thought I should sound. A lot of my ideas got shot down. The music industry was trying to put me in a box — the box inside the box inside the box. Luckily, I got to hang out with and look up to people like Missy Elliott and Trina and Lauryn Hill and Queen Latifah, who became a big blueprint for how I wanted my career to go, coming from hip-hop, but also being able to transcend.
I was a huge No Doubt fan — like, huuuge . I loved Gwen Stefani and nobody understood what I was saying when I wanted to do the song with her. People looked at me like I was crazy. But we’re the same in the sense that we’re girly girls who are also tomboys — the girl with the boys, because I was that. I knew she’d want to hang out with the girls because she’s always with boys. We just clicked.
Now I love Leikeli47, Doja Cat — she’s so freaking dope. Her lyrics are amazing. Coi Leray. Latto is lyrically great. I love Megan, Cardi, Nicki. I love the fact that there’s so many women that I can actually name. There were years when I would be like: Where . Are . The Women ? It’d be the one or the two. Finally, there is an actual landscape. I love it.
ICE CUBE
I knew a lot of slick-talking dudes that would rhyme all the time. Everybody had a little rap somewhere. I remember Teena Marie, Blondie — Muhammad Ali was rapping. It was just the cool thing to do.
But it wasn’t until songs like “Buffalo Gals,” “More Bounce to the Ounce,” “8th Wonder,” “La Di Da Di” — these are the songs that started to really get me turned on to rap. Blowfly had a song called “Rapp Dirty,” and when we were in fifth grade my friend and I would wait till his mama left and we would just play “Rapp Dirty” and Prince songs like “Head.” The adults would try to make you go to bed when it was time to listen to those records.
I loved KRS-One. He had a lot of different styles, a lot of different techniques. And he had one of the coldest names ever when you broke it down: Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone. He was an in-your-face rapper who came with style and intelligence. “Criminal Minded,” “The Blueprint” — masterpieces. He’s just one of the best that ever blessed the mic.
My first group, the Stereo Crew, had a song with Epic Records that didn’t hit. I don’t know if we sold five of them. We got dropped after that single. There were local groups we looked up to that were way bigger: Uncle Jamm’s Army, L.A. Dream Team, the Wreckin’ Cru, King Tee, Ice-T, of course. Toddy Tee and Mix Master Spade, Joe Cooley, Rodney-O. They were all starting to make noise.
Me, Sir Jinx and K-Dee, or Kid Disaster, we was going around joining rap contests and battles. We could never get into the talent shows because they didn’t want rap music back then. It was a hobby. There was a little money from playing shows, but nothing to think that you could not have a regular job.
I went to a trade school called Phoenix Institute of Technology, in Phoenix, Ariz., and got a certificate in architectural drafting. I already had a hit record at the time — N.W.A had “Dope Man” out. Dre kept saying, “You sure you want to go to school?”
I got entrenched into the hip-hop community in Phoenix at the time. Artists would come through and perform at a place called the Celebrity Theater — Fat Boys, Doug E. Fresh, EPMD. They knew I had a hit record out, so they would let me kick it backstage.
I was going back and forth every other weekend because Southwest had a great deal — $50 for a one-way ticket. When I graduated, in September ’88, we was in the middle of making Eazy’s “Eazy-Duz-It” album.
This was dirty, underground, hardcore rap. Explicit lyrics. We all thought we would have records in the Rudy Ray Moore section, next to the Richard Pryor records. Who would play this? Who would make this mainstream? We were being told that we were fools for spending our money to make records that couldn’t get played on the radio. It was just a ridiculous notion. But Eazy didn’t care — he felt like if a hundred people played it, that was good enough.
ICE SPICE
Middle school was a really important time, that’s when I realized that I was into hip-hop, specifically. All the mainstream artists, to be honest, that are GOAT-ed now. A lot of Drake, Nicki, Kendrick.
My dad rapped — he’s pretty private, so I wasn’t like, sitting there listening to his mixtapes. I would say he’s more like a freestyle type of rapper. It’s not like that was his whole life, but thinking back, that’s probably where it could have sparked for me, personally.
When drill started happening, I remember listening to a lot of Pop Smoke and Sheff G and Sleepy Hallow. I just enjoyed the overall feelings that the music gives, that summertime vibe. In my earphones, that’s what I was playing. Just listening to their beat selections and their choice of topics, I feel like that inspired me a lot.
I’m still growing and learning as an artist. I wouldn’t even say like, we’re fully here. Like we’ve arrived at my sound. It’s always changing and evolving. But I feel like in a couple years people will refer to this as my “Like..?” era.
My approach is really a reflection of my personality. That’s just how I am in real life. And I feel like I’ve always been influencing people, even before everything popped off, whether it was at school or whatever the case. But now it’s on a bigger scale, so it’s way better now. It’s musically, but also when it comes to how people wear their hair or how they wanna wear their makeup, how they wear their nails. Even with the lingo, certain things they say in songs, beat selection, cadence, personality. There’s so much to take inspo from.
But, you know, I feel like we’re all constantly influencing each other. I do the same thing in my own way. Like, I’ve taken inspo from so many different pieces of the world that I can only be flattered by it, you know what I’m saying? Like whenever I find myself almost feeling a certain way — like, Oh, why this person sound just like me or why they trying to look like me? — I have to remember like, that’s the whole point. That’s just how art works.
LADYBUG MECCA
I grew up in the DMV, and my friend had a lot of family in Brooklyn. So he would travel there and spend summers and he would record the Red Alert radio show on cassette. At that time in the DMV — this was like ’85, ’86 — go-go had more presence than hip-hop, so we were a select few that were even into it on that level. I became obsessed. It was just so fly and next level. I had already been writing my observations about the world down on like, little pieces of paper or napkins. So hearing people expressing themselves through words, through rhymes, through cadence, it just grabbed me, you know?
The Jungle Brothers really stands out for me in terms of those cassettes. Everything sonically, like the rhythms, the tone of their vocals, their wordplay. Musically, it was just a sound that I hadn’t really heard. It felt like the future, like complete freedom of expression, being like completely free in your skin. That’s the best way I can explain it.
I learned to rap by listening. I really loved MC Lyte. Queen Latifah’s “Wrath of My Madness” was mind-blowing, just out of this world. And Public Enemy, their rhythm spoke to my internal rhythm, you know what I mean? It was just like family, you know, I don’t know how else to explain it.
In high school, my other close friends had a hip-hop group and I started off dancing for them. And then I started writing and doing little shows, like local stuff. And it became very, very serious once, you know, Knowledge and Ishmael [Doodlebug and Butterfly] asked me to be in the group. That’s when it became a reality, like I could do this possibly for a living.
When we were out, we felt connected to the whole Native Tongues. Tribe, De La of course. Arrested Development. Gang Starr. I’m heavily influenced by Sweet Tee’s music. I looked to everyone, like Special Ed, Big Daddy Kane, all these people, they’re my inspiration. Daddy Kane was so smooth and cool, he was just everything. I couldn’t wait to get home to turn on the TV and watch music videos and just see what new I could absorb.
PROJECT PAT
My earliest memory is LL Cool J and some of the New York rappers. And of course, N.W.A and Ice Cube. But Scarface and the Geto Boys, man. Face is the one. I could visualize what he was saying. I hadn’t heard nobody tell a story about living down South. On one line Face was talking about how he was selling dope in the apartments, and that’s the stuff I was seeing in Memphis.
I grew up on DJ Squeeky — Squeeky used to have the club rocking. I listened to 8Ball & MJG. And anything Cash Money. Those are our guys, we was messing with them before they made it big. Paul and Juicy was on them before they even blew up.
When I made my first tape, I had a robbery charge pending. They were trying to give me 30 years, so I wasn’t thinking about no future in rap. But my brother and I could always make a word rhyme. I grew up around a lot of pimps on the street. I would ask them about their little pimp sayings. I would hear them saying it and I would flip it and turn it around in my raps. The pimps were my major influence.
Back in the days, New York didn’t accept rappers who weren’t from there. So I knew I made it when Funkmaster Flex dropped a bomb on my song. I was in New York one time and this is when “Sippin’ on Some Syrup” was rolling. Three 6 Mafia had sold something like 2 million copies of the whole album. So Flex dropped a bomb on “Sippin’ on Some Syrup,” right? And then he turned around and played “Chickenhead” and dropped a bomb on that one. I couldn’t believe it.
Then I did a show back in 2010 in New York, and the whole ASAP Rocky crew was there. I couldn’t believe it. And I was the headliner and the whole show was sold out. And when Cardi B made that “Bickenhead” song, man, that was a blessing. We love all the different artists that came after us — they keep us alive.
TRIPPIE REDD
My mom would listen to oldies, like, Tupac, Biggie, Jay-Z, Ja Rule, that soulful sound. And my dad listened to more like street underground from back in that era. People like Rich the Factor, Jadakiss, the Jacka and Ampichino, Fred the Godson. And then my uncle would listen to like more of the newer stuff, like Wayne and Drake and Thug. On my own time, when it came to YouTube, I would go listen to like rock, so like Kiss and the Red Jumpsuit Apparatus. I used to play Saints Row and they had a track on the game and it made me a fan.
My brother passed away when I was young, so that kind of gave me that drive to start wanting to make music. And I would sit at my grandma’s house and just rap on the stairs and be there for like two, three hours, just freestyling. We would have little things at school where we would have to write, so I would show my pen skills. I would make my school projects cool. Like, oh, I’m gonna write a letter to Drake. I literally did that too. I wrote a rap to Drake. I was in like seventh grade.
I started like experimenting with Auto-Tune and getting to my own sound. Auto-Tune and stuff like that, it got me into SoundCloud. That was like the beginning of like that super underground phase, Ugly God and Playboi Carti and Lil Uzi Vert, I started making music around the same time as them. But I didn’t blow up until the XXXTentacion and Juice WRLD era. I liked X and Lil Peep. If you go to my SoundCloud, it was really X, Lil Peep and then Uzi, too.
Lil Peep was on that sad boy [expletive]. That was hard. I love that. Just that feeling of, you know, depression and sadness and pain. That’s kind of where I was at the time, I felt like their movement is fire. Like they’re doing exactly what I envision myself doing.
I also listen to a lot of rock, though. I love Chino from Deftones. He’s passionately in character with his vocals. It’s like you gotta make certain movements and certain faces to hit certain notes. Sometimes he’ll just like go from like a melody to breathing and it sounds the same, like the melody and the breathing is all in one. It just sounds hard to me.
I’m not quite a rapper. I’m the odd man out. People mistake me for a rapper and then it’ll leave me in that box. So the way I could stay out of that box is by creating music that keeps me out of it.
CARDI B
An unforgettable moment as a child was when I saw Missy Elliott take off her head in the “One Minute Man” video, and that just made me like, go crazy for it. That’s all I wanted. It’s like, I don’t want to hear Barney anymore, you know what I’m saying? I don’t want to hear Disney movies music anymore. I just automatically got into hip-hop.
My female cousins that were older than me, they always listened to Lil’ Kim, Foxy, all the girls that was out at the moment. I always remember, my mom used to be like, “Don’t be playing that too much around the kids.” Then I got into Trina’s type of music. Trina makes like, you know, a nasty, freak nasty type of music. Lil’ Kim does freak nasty too, but I feel like they have different types of style. The route for me was more of a Trina route. It’s crazy because I’m a New Yorker, but I was always into that Trina and the Khia and the Jacki-O type of vibe.
As a teen, it just made me be like, yeah, “I wanna be [expletive] like them.” And that’s how I really am, actually. I started doing music when I was 23, but I was listening to these girls at 15, 16, 17, 18. So the personality that their music gave me stuck to me.
At the time, I just stopped stripping, so I was very much still in that whole stripper world. I wanted the music to be about me. My first song, “Washpoppin’,” it’s like, “I need all my moneymakers bring that cash out/I need all my D-boys to bring that cash out.” It was get money type of music. And then I also was making music for the gangsters because I felt like I was just such a gangster-ass little bitch.
My manager, he used to have long conversations with me like, how do you feel? I used to be like, oh, you know, I feel overwhelmed, sometimes I feel really tired. And then he would ask me weird questions like, so how do your boyfriend make you feel? How do you feel about love? How do you feel about your past relationships? And then I would have a conversation with him about my past relationships and my traumas. And then he’ll be like, oh, OK, so put that on your music. And that’s when I started to talk more about other things than just the things that I was doing in my past, like gang [expletive], street [expletive] and stripper [expletive].
TOO SHORT
I’ve been into the whole James Brown, Bootsy Collins, George Clinton, Parliament-Funkadelic thing since fourth or fifth grade. There were a lot of songs before “Rapper’s Delight” that had a little hip-hop vibe, but just didn’t have that name. It wasn’t called rapping. And you don’t even realize it until you go back and grow up a little more and listen back to songs of your childhood. James Brown is talking and, you know, telling you the breakdown’s coming — give me the horns . It’s just there.
I don’t even know if that was related to the New York streets in the ’70s or whatever, but I do know that words and rhythms were said over disco and funk records. But you know, once “Rapper’s Delight” hit, I think the DNA of hip-hop was planted in me. I would never not like that kind of music ever again.
I’m like, 13, pushing on 14. My father has a really nice stereo system set up in the living room. I’m talking like ’79, and if you’re what they called an audiophile, which he was, you really wanted to have your speaker set up for you to sit in a certain area and get a great musical experience. I got a little window between 3:30, 4, when I get home, and 5:30, 6, when he gets home from work. So those two hours, I could play it and just play it loud. “Rapper’s Delight” was the favorite, and there was another song that came out around that time, Parliament-Funkadelic’s “(Not Just) Knee Deep.” “Rapper’s Delight” is approaching like, 15 minutes on the 12-inch and “Knee Deep” is about the same. I would just play those two records back to back — you play them twice each and an hour’s gone by, you know?
Before there was any definitive identity in music-making for myself, it was purely based on anything George Clinton did. Any relation to Parliament-Funkadelic was the inspiration for how the music should go, how the drum pattern should go, how the bass line should go, how the breakdown should go. I always look at James Brown like, you know, the New York guys already got to that. They’re getting all the best samples and you’re too late on that train right there. But not a lot of people had gotten into the Parliament-Funkadelic and just recycled the funk.
The first rappers that had a profound effect on me were Spoonie Gee and Melle Mel. Spoonie Gee was just silky smooth with it — he was a player, one of the first players, if not the first, on the microphone — and he told stories of his day, just interacting with people and the ladies. He was just my favorite. These songs are coming out about these parties and kicking it and bragging — the early days, Sugar Hill Records. Then all of a sudden, here comes a guy who’s like, I’ve met this lady and I took her to my spot and I [expletive] her. And it’s like, he’s my guy .
And Melle Mel, “The Message,” it was just an amazing insight on New York life. I was already rapping when “The Message” came out, but there was no substance to what I was doing. It motivated me to start writing songs about my city. And that changed everything.
In my tapes, I’m using all the latest slang words. I’m naming popular people in the neighborhood. I’m talking about current events, whatever is, like, really ours. We talking 1982, ’83. “Rap is hot, but we got our kid right here. Too Short, he’s ours.” The entire east side of Oakland knew about us because we sold tapes in the streets. When we went into the streets and first started selling tapes, we only sold tapes to drug dealers. We had like a paper route of drug-selling spots.
I had all these little books that I would write rhymes in and my mom found them. I don’t know what she read. She never approached me and said anything. She just wrote this long letter saying, “I didn’t raise you like this. I hope you don’t believe in this stuff. Why are you doing this?” It was enough to make a brother want to cry.
You think James Brown’s mama would have been like, boy, stop gyrating and dancing? Or Little Richard’s mama? I don’t know. It’s the next generation. And my generation right now does not understand the look and the vibe that 16-year-old rappers are on. But you look at the video and it’s 300 million hits. Somebody gets it.
DMC
I was in seventh grade, 1978. We were all in the schoolyard and Billy Morris, who was in the eighth grade, he wasn’t like a thug or a gangster, but he knew all of them. We thought he was going to try to make us smoke cigarettes and drink Night Train or Thunderbird, that 99-cent liquor. When we got over there, he had this tape recorder and said, “Check this out.” He pushed play and a beat came on and we heard this voice say, “When you keep the pep in your step you don’t stop ’til you get on the mountaintop/And when you reach the top, you reach the peak, that’s when you’ll hear Eddie Cheba speak.” That was the first time I heard hip-hop on tape.
Billy let me hold that tape for a weekend. He saw how bad I wanted it. I listened to it from Friday night all the way up to Sunday night at 10 o’clock. My moms was like, “Boy, you better get your butt in bed. You got school in the morning!”
Summer vacation comes, and now I’m seeing hip-hop at the park parties and the block parties. All that was probably going on all this time but it wasn’t until the tape that I paid attention to it. By having that tape with me for the weekend it became part of me. Now I’m open for that vibration. This was in Queens. I didn’t know anything about the Bronx. I couldn’t even leave the block!
My brother, who is three years older than me, comes home talking about getting a turntable because his friends were all getting turntables. So long story short, we didn’t sell weed. My brother and I were broke. All I had was this huge Marvel comic book collection. So my brother says, “Yo, we ain’t got no money, but D, you got a lot of comic books. We are going to do a comic books sale so we can buy some turntables and a microphone.”
Me and my brother buy the turntables. Every time he would leave, I would go to the basement and try to figure them out. It wasn’t until I heard Grandmaster Flash that I really got interested in DJing. In Queens we called them Flash tapes. These were live performances that were going on in the Bronx, Harlem and Manhattan that were coming into Queens via cassette tapes being sold like records in every hood. Flash tapes, DJ Hollywood tapes, Zulu Nation tapes were all going around Queens.
Everybody is playing that “Rapper’s Delight” song. And the only thing I really paid attention to on that song was that Superman rhyme. It was so different from all the other raps. Because I was a good student, I listened to “Rapper’s Delight” three times and learned it from start to end.
My brother brings home a record called “Superappin’” by Grandmaster Flash, the guy from the tape who had these Furious Five MCs. It changed my life because it came on with so much power. “It was a party night everybody was breaking/The highs were screamin’ and the bass was shakin’/And it won’t be long ’til everybody knowin’ that Flash was on the beat box!” It was so different from “Rapper’s Delight.” It resonated with my youthful rebellious nature. That was the day Darryl McDaniels became Easy D.
I think because I was into comic books I understood the alter ego thing. Melvin Glover is Melle Mel. Mohandas Dewese is Kool Moe Dee. They had these alter egos so I knew I could play into that.
The ones that made me want to get on the mic, of course it was Melle Mel and Kool Moe Dee. But the artists that changed my life was DJ Charlie Chase, DJ Tony Tone, and the Cold Crush Four who were Grandmaster Caz, JDL, Easy A.D. and the Almighty Kay Gee. They are the greatest group in hip-hop that a lot of people don’t know about. They kept it raw on the MC performance thing. I changed my name to DMC because of GMC, Grandmaster Caz.
“Rapper’s Delight” and “The Breaks” were cool. But the greatest period in hip-hop is the time before recorded rap. It was a live tape of the Fantastic Five vs. the Cold Crush Four at Harlem World that changed what I thought about rapping. They was playing Billy Squier’s “Big Beat,” they were taking Spoonie Gee’s “Love Rap,” and they were making routines out of them! They were flipping everything that had been done and taking it to another level. That made me say, wow, you can be a rock star with this. The attitude they had reminded me of AC/DC or Iron Maiden mixed in with George Clinton, Parliament-Funkadelic and James Brown.
For me, I took real vocal inspiration from Freddie Mercury, Robert Plant and Mick Jagger. Especially Mick because Freddie was usually very melodic. He could do opera, but Mick was different, raw. I’m the king of rock. I didn’t want to be the king of rap. All I cared about was comic books. Black music was in my house, but I saw it as my mother’s and father’s music back then. It was 30-, 40- and 50-year-olds. They are listening to all this great Black music by people like Aretha and James Brown. I didn’t get it as a kid, but with ’70s rock radio there was a station in New York City called 770 WABC. Harry Harrison and Dan Ingram, they would play James Brown, Marvin Gaye, Al Green and Aretha Franklin. But they also played Harry Chapin, Bob Dylan, Led Zeppelin, the Stones and Joni Mitchell.
So the reason why I love rock more is not only the voices were stronger, louder and powerful and they looked like superheroes, the drums and the guitars were stronger and louder. It was like the Incredible Hulk to me. So the confidence that I had was like, “OK, I may not be as eloquent in words as Moe Dee and the rest of the Treacherous Three. But if I rock this mic like I’m a member of the Rolling Stones or Led Zeppelin? If I bring that persona to hip-hop?” Man … it worked. Chuck D said it: Run-DMC showed hip-hop could be done on rock star levels. That’s why I said, “I’m the king of rock/there is none higher!”
CAMRON
I started watching, paying attention when I was 8, 9 years old. I’ll be here forever telling you a bunch of names, but people that I loved was KRS-One. Kool G Rap, Slick Rick, 3rd Bass, EPMD, A Tribe Called Quest, N.W.A, Gang Starr, De La Soul, Queen Latifah, Naughty by Nature. I remember going to the Gap trying to get polka dot shirts because Kwamé had a polka dot shirt.
To me it was neck and neck between the conscious and the street rap, then all of a sudden the gangster just took over. Maybe because what was going on outside of rap with the drugs and crime. Maybe that elevated gangster music more than regular music.
My aunt lives in Inglewood, so I used to go to California in the summers and hear the radio and they wasn’t playing what we was playing. And then I went to Navarro College in Corsicana, Texas, in ’94. And I remember getting to school and it was like a culture shock almost, ’cause it was no New York music being played. All they played was Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. Also these guys that I wasn’t aware of that had a big influence on the South, UGK. I loved it. With UGK, I think Bun B can rap with anybody, any state. I think Pimp C was more a lifestyle thing. Bun and Pimp, they mesh beautifully.
When I came home from Christmas break that year, “Shook Ones” was out and I was like, yeah, New York! I went back to school with “Shook Ones” on a cassette tape and I kept playing that every day. That had me in the New York mentality and I end up pistol-whipping somebody and getting kicked out of school.
So with me being from New York, I learned a balance. I don’t want to act like I’m not a lyricist, but then at the same time it may be too much for people. I probably have more male listeners, but I always keep in the back in my mind, I want some girls coming to my show, too. This one of my top three rappers, but I’ve never heard any girl be like, yo, throw that Kool G Rap on.
I remember when I was on the verge of getting a deal. I was at this girl house and Jay-Z was just coming out. He didn’t have an album yet. His first few singles was out. I’m like, yo, Nas is nice, man. She like, nah, I like Jay-Z. She said, Cam, I don’t want to carry a dictionary to the club with me when I go out.
That Nas and Jay-Z argument, it wasn’t just with the girl. I seen it starting to happen in different conversations and I was like, Jay is kind of the new standard. Before we had phones, when I didn’t have a deal, I used to keep 100 different loose-leaf papers in my pocket. I was like, whenever Jay-Z come out with something, I gotta come out with something because I seen where it was going and how people started adapting to him.
There wasn’t anybody that we said we need to be like them or rap like them. What I did see was that movements were always accepted. Whether it was the Native Tongues, the Hit Squad, or whether it was Cash Money or No Limit, or Roc-A-Fella or Murder Inc. I was like, I could create a team to where if you don’t like Cam, you may like Juelz. If you don’t like Juelz or Cam, you may like Jim Jones. ’Cause we used to be on my block arguing about who was the best in No Limit and people used to be like, oh, y’all don’t even know about Mr. Serv-On. And I would pay attention to these arguments and I’d be like, yo, everybody likes No Limit, but they have their favorites. So as long as you like No Limit, it don’t even really matter, ’cause you like the brand.
I remember Master P arguing with a DJ in New York. I won’t say the name. And they was trying to say, yo man, if you come to New York, we could give you this, this and this, ’cause Master P never had been in New York. And Master P, I remember him telling the DJ, look man, I don’t need New York. I don’t need y’all. I’m good. And I was like, yo, [expletive] is really eating outside of New York. So I already knew it’s an audience for that, so I always kept that in my mind.
Years later, Pimp C called me one day and he said, “Hey man, I’m about to dis the whole East Coast except for y’all. Them [expletive] up there be fronting. I believe y’all raps, man. I was at ’106 & Park,’ I seen Juelz. He had a Maserati, that thing was cute. Everybody else, they ain’t getting no money like us down here. But I think y’all are.’”
LL COOL J
It really started with the tapes that were floating around the city. The Cold Crush and the Fantastic Romantic 5 and the Force MCs and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Four, and then Five MCs. And then later on it was Fearless Four and the Treacherous Three. And Zulu Nation.
I lived between Long Island and Queens, but I actually got exposed more on Long Island because next door to me was a whole house full of foster kids, and they were from the five boroughs, but mainly the Bronx and Uptown. They were bringing tapes, some better quality than others, so I was hearing everything way earlier. I was hearing it as it was unfolding.
One day I was in the hallway in junior high, I had already been rhyming for quite a while, and this kid was singing part of a Jimmy Spicer song: “This DJ, he gets down, mixing records while they go ’round.” The light was coming through the hall and it was just me and him, he didn’t know I was there. I just remember the way he looked when he was singing that. And the way it sounded — it just clicked for me. I said, That’s what I want to do for real. I actually want to step into that dimension. It was like a dream.
From there I just started joining a lot of groups. Some rejected me. At the end of the day, I just worked really, really hard. I went everywhere. I was all over the city. I was all over Queens. I started going uptown to Harlem. At about maybe 15, 16, right before I actually ended up recording, I started hanging out with a guy named Silver Fox. Silver Fox was like a tutor for me when it came to the craft of writing rhymes and cadences and lyrics and all that. He also mentored Kool G Rap in a different way. Fox was real skillful, and he was a very prolific songwriter.
Lyrically, I was inspired by Melle Mel, Spoonie Gee, the Treacherous Three, the Fearless Four — DLB, Tito, Mighty Mike C, Peso. Those were the guys that really were into wordplay. A lot of their wordplay still holds up very well. They all had unbelievable style, and I was able to learn a lot from them. It’s kind of like I would imagine a guitar player sitting down and listening to how people roll them licks and hit them chords, and then after a while you just kind of develop your own thing.
One thing led to another. I was just sending tapes out and finally, obviously, my tape got in the hands of Rick Rubin in his dorm and Adam Horovitz of the Beastie Boys. By the time I got to “I Need a Beat,” I was ready to rhyme on any stage, in any arena, with anybody.
I did run into a little bit of arrogance here and there, which is why I’ve always tried my best not to treat anybody the way some of these guys treated me. It was a very small community, though. No industry. In other words, there were no managers. Russell Simmons ended up managing people, but he was still learning his way. There was no network of people. It was just a few believers here and there. I’m a generation 1.5 artist — myself, Run-DMC, Beastie Boys. Meaning that we tapped into the culture, evolved with the culture, but then we are the ones who went out and actually turned it into a full-blown, worldwide global industry.
BOOTS RILEY
When I was 15, I was trying to get my boy Johnny to come to police brutality rallies. I was like, man, you can rap and it’s gonna be a lot of people there. And he would be like, I’m only gonna do it if you rap, too.
Often what I was doing was just stealing Schoolly D stuff because nobody knew it. In school, pounding on the table and rapping, I was also doing theater. Somebody came up with the idea like, let’s do our own version of “West Side Story,” but we’re at East Oakland, so let’s call it “East Side Story” and let’s make it all rap. So that was my first writing.
I spoke at a rally at U.C. Berkeley, and this dude Pizo the Beat Fixer who was Too Short’s DJ for a while comes up to me and says, “Hey man, do you rap, ’cause that political [expletive] could hit right now.” I was like, yeah, matter of fact, I do. He put out an album that was me, Spice 1 and a dude named Mocedes who was known at the time because he was on Tony! Toni! Toné! song where he says, “Mocedes, the mellow.” Later on, he got known as Mopreme, Tupac’s stepbrother.
Here’s the thing with every local artist, even to this day — we’re all taught that we aren’t [expletive]. I remember I was in junior high when Too Short got to open up on the Fresh Fest. And people were talking about, oh, how they let him on, blah, blah, blah, this and that. It wasn’t until MC Hammer and Digital Underground where people started being like, oh, you know, this is something local but other people like it. You have this little town mentality. And so when we had the Coup, it took until we could show that people other places liked us to where people claim you. Because everybody wants to be connected to something important.
I mean, there was definitely a sense of teamwork happening, people sharing contacts, people wanting shows to happen. I do have to say this for the 20-year-olds that are reading, you’re not like, reposting each other’s things. You show up at each other’s thing. You’re in each other’s videos. E-40’s uncle was distributing most everybody’s stuff. At one point, my manager was Chaz Hayes, and he was managing us, Spice 1, E-40, Master P and some of the members of Tony! Toni! Toné!
“Soul Beat” on TV was the way that you also heard about stuff. They had stuff like Ice Cube when he was just in C.I.A., dancing by the pool. So the Coup and E-40 and the Click were performing at Soul Beat Day, and backstage E-40 and Studio Ton was like, “Hey, we want to do something with that lyric of yours ‘practice looking hard.’” So that’s when we started doing stuff together. We were doing a lot of car shows, lowrider shows up and down California. I still have my trophies from doing those lowrider shows.
I remember Wild Pitch said to us, we got this idea. They were like, you don’t really fit into a genre, and we think one way to get past that is to put you on a college tour. And we’re like, we’re not making no college music. Meanwhile that’s who’s buying the records, so we made a terrible mistake.
But they gave us $14,000. So we went on a 50-day tour in a minivan where we got out in each city, we put up our own posters, put up our own stickers, asked people where the record stores were and went to the record store, played them our record, made ’em listen to it.
When we got to D.C., the label was like, we’re not getting any headway with BET. We had saved up our per diem, you know, we each had $5 a day. We knocked on the door, we told Joe Clair to pick wherever he wants to go to eat. We took him to eat and hung out with him and showed him the video. And then a week later, I think it was Memorial Day, they played it crazy. Right then we were in Cleveland and people started being like, I just saw you on TV.
EARL SWEATSHIRT
My best friend when I was like 4 or 5 years old, literally in a hip-hop movie-style fashion, came over to my house with a Rob Base tape. The only thing that makes that unique is that it happened in 2001 and not in 1988. It must have been his parents’.
By the way, a lot of people’s favorite flows from their faves right now is basic party-rocking flows from the ’80s. The ’80s is back. Like BabyTron — Detroit got the ’80s really right here in our face right now.
Before I went to Samoa, I was listening to Lupe, Hov, De La, Common, P, Dilla. Dilla as a rapper, I’m not gonna do the whole annoying thing right now, but that was a huge thing. Like, I spent a lot of time as a 12-year-old really locking in flow-wise. I’m always gonna fly the flag for the Cool Kids. I feel like Cool Kids and De La, if you squint, it’s a similar space. Now that De La is back on streaming, bro, I’ve been on it heavy. Rappers still can’t rap like that. Like, it’s too free, but structured. It has that impossibleness to it.
By the time of my first tape, I didn’t even have enough time to synthesize all of my influences. You know how Peter Parker first gets bit by the spider and his web is all over the place, he’s gotta get the suit? It was that. I’m finally at the point where I can even hold all of this at once, or be dexterous enough to move within all of it.
But when I was like 15, on my first tape, I was listening to Eminem and Doom. Which is where everyone checks in with me at — everyone’s like, OK, Doom-Eminem guy. Everyone is mad because I don’t say, like, “hazardous” when I rap anymore. [Expletive] is really excited by just one-for-one-ing four-syllable words. It’s a good party rap trick. But that’s easy, you know what I mean?
A thing that has kept me healthy is never being xenophobic about the Brits. I’ve been listening to British rappers the whole time. I think you dust yourself if you don’t. They are really, really, really, really, really good at rapping. They got the freedom of like some dancehall, bro. A lot of where it will be hanging off the cliff’s edge of a beat. That’s what I love about them though — you can go to a new place if you let yourself go over there. It’s like jazz standards, bro. If you don’t have a valid U.K. flow, then you’re gonna get dusted.
Growing up, I feel like we were the first generation that was familiar with everything but, like, maybe don’t want to listen to it all day. But we’re finally at this point that I used to joke about like five years ago, where little kids don’t know Tupac and that’s not embarrassing. It’s supported.
Every generation of 19-, 20-year-olds is gonna come along and be like, [expletive] what you guys just did, I don’t care about it. Maybe that’s like a natural kind of thing that happens as you stand up as a human being. But learning how to listen to Nas, learning how to listen to these things that even though you want to listen to Lil Wayne all day, your older brother, your uncles are like, this is it right here — that’s important.
And I’m still down for that. From my own experience with committing these passages of song to my memory, I know the utility of being a historian so you can draw lines from that to the new thing and not be lost. And then most importantly not become jaded and not have a in-house fighting thing going on that’s yielded some pretty nasty [expletive].
I was part of that first generation that came on the internet and was like, [expletive] this [expletive]. And then old heads were like, what is y’all little [expletive] talking about? And then having that butting-heads thing unnecessarily, because we gotta work together, you feel me? It’s like being in a house. If the adults only interacted with the adults and the children only interacted with the children, it doesn’t work.
You gotta be around kids. This is what I’m saying about the utility of the multigenerational aspect of this thing. The elders know what happened so they can inform the younger ones on, oh, if you like this, then you should check out this, this and this, so you can see the iterations that came before and you can do something different. And then the young people are here to teach the old people this new dance move.
If there’s one thing that comes through this article, I hope it’s this. I want to clarify for people that’s inspired by what I do. I feel like because of my disposition, the thing that I see some kids take away is like a mood and a vocal timbre. And it’s like, I went to the Samoa boys school, my whole [expletive] was all [expletive] up. Whatever weirdness everyone watched me go through was legitimately genuine for me. That is not a stylistic choice. I wish that I didn’t sound like that.
I hope that what they take away from me is be good at rapping. That’s the thing that I care about. I really don’t [expletive] with being a tortured artist. Being tortured is not tight. Rapping hella good is tight. Pigeonholing me means you can just feign knowledge by being like, oh, he makes sad music. Bro, if you listen to my music, 70% of my music is about being better than you. I am a very competitive rapper.
I feel like I had the world put in my hands and I was like, what the [expletive] is this right here? And so I don’t want you to copy that part. I’m saying if you ever get the world in your hands, be free.
Q-TIP
My sister was best friends with Sweet Tee — she made that record, “It’s My Beat.” So back when I was little-little, I remember hearing them talk about records, like, you heard that Treacherous Three record? I’m like, Treacherous Three, I’m thinking it’s like superheroes.
There was a record store on Linden Boulevard, like, right up from my house — I forget the name of it. I used to go there with no money and just ask him about the records and just to see the records. And he would play them for me. You had hundreds and hundreds of 12-inches that would just start popping up. Back then it was still coming out of the disco culture — “Rapper’s Delight,” Fatback Band, “King Tim III (Personality Jock),” Ronnie Gee, “Raptivity.”
We heard “Rapper’s Delight,” and I’ll never forget Phife calling me like, yo, we can do that! The newness of it left us wide-eyed and inspired and hopeful.
You think about the Treacherous Three, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, the Fearless Four, everybody had a group. So you have all these vocalists trading off. And if you even wanna get geekier about it, it goes back to like the old doo-wop street-corner harmony. Famously Run-DMC obviously took that whole interplay between them two and made it worldwide. And of course we wanted to be like them.
I was a big fan of LL Cool J, Kool Moe Dee, T La Rock, L.A. Sunshine from Treacherous Three. All of the dudes where the vocabulary was just a little extra. Slick Rick was huge — his sound, his tone, his voice and the confidence, you know?
Obviously coming up with the Jungle Brothers and De La Soul and the whole Native Tongues, we were tuned to be a little bit more cerebral. And all of the aforementioned icons got us to that point where we knew that we could cannonball off of the diving board. But I remember us wanting to even go further, to be like some Earth, Wind & Fire or some Parliament-Funkadelic. Like to really try to turn it on its ear, and just let that flag fly.
Our thing was to try to marry the two, the music and the content of the lyrics. And to try to be differentiators even amongst our caper partners. And to our left and to our right, when you would look, there’s N.W.A doing that same thing. The music that Dre was putting with the subject matter fit so perfectly. It was fresh, it was just new and it was exciting to be able to emotionalize the music.
Dre and I speak all the time. That’s my bro. We actually have great musical volleys. Obviously LL. I still speak to the De La guys, of course. I catch Latifah here and there. A good deal of us still keep up. I still speak to Lauryn. It may not be like a full open faucet stream of conversation all the time, but we still keep up. I remember talking to Snoop years ago and he was like, man, when y’all made that “Back in the days in the boulevard,” me and Warren G used to rap y’all [expletive].
I think it was 1991, we were doing a Midwest and South gauntlet with the Geto Boys. We were opening for them — they were huge down there. Probably the two most unlikely groups, right? But we had so much fun, man. We was big fans of them, we was rapping they [expletive] to them and they was rapping our [expletive] back to us. It was just amazing. I remember very early on we had a show with DJ Quik and KRS in Compton, and just seeing all the Bloods, and they was just rocking to “El Segundo” and “Bonita” and it was just like, wow, this is really a unifying music.
Because of the scarcity then, when you got in, you had to be good. To be good was the average. I think that everybody’s grind back then to get on was something that created conduits of empathy amongst us all. So that when we did see each other, we were able to tell each other griot tales of how we all got on. “Y’all too? Even in Houston? Even in Cali? Even in Miami?”
When you’re doing it, you feel like you’re on your own planet, right? But then when people dig it and you start seeing other people draw inspiration from what we did, it let us know that we were onto something and it also made the world a little less scary, if that makes sense.
It’s just a great moment of, for me personally, humility and appreciation, when you see a Digable Planets or Arrested Development, a Pharcyde or Souls of Mischief, the Roots. You could go to Badu, the Fugees. And Dilla, who was the great extender of the parlance and endowed it with his own beautiful traits.
That’s to me what I take a great sense of pride in, that I can see all of these guys go on and do honestly better than what we did and to lay even more tracks for us. And it’s like, “Come on, let’s go.”
50 CENT
I fell in love with hip-hop, but it was only playing for one hour out the week on the radio. My grandmother used to go to church and take a tape recorder and record everything the minister said, and she would play Sunday service to herself again on like, Wednesday. She had all of these Maxell cassette tapes that once you record, you break the little tab off. I had to go get toilet paper and put it in the square and record over what she already had for the church. It was only on for one hour — I had to record it then.
This is back when KRS was out, he made such an impression on my career early on, ’cause creatively, that aggression that was there. I didn’t follow a complete blueprint of what he’d done, and at one point he got so much smarter than the audience that it wasn’t entertaining because it was like learning some [expletive]. It was teaching. That’s where he lost me a little bit. But when he came in the beginning, he had the competitive energy — that was what hip-hop was to me the entire time.
He said, “Manhattan keeps on making it, Brooklyn keeps on taking it/Bronx keeps creating it and Queens keeps on faking it.” And I’m from Queens! I liked it so much. But I didn’t know how I felt about it because of what it said.
If you look at that, then look at what I done at the desperation point where Columbia didn’t understand who I was as an artist. I was approaching the release date and I had to do something. I know I don’t have the momentum or anything. It’s going to not work, and it not working isn’t an option. So “How to Rob” — that’s my version of that energy.
Biggie and Tupac, following that, artists were afraid to say each other’s names. So Nas was saying “20 G bets I’m winning ’em, threats I’m sending ’em/Lex with TV sets the minimum.” It was him describing Jay-Z. “In My Lifetime.” Subliminally talking about each other without actually mentioning each other’s name.
My personality difference from the other artists, I’ve been bumped around more than them the entire journey. On my journey early on, it was rough. Then as the music business was doing it to me too, I kind of didn’t know how to not respond like the pit bull that you have outside in the yard.
Early on, Dre was like, I know what this is, this is N.W.A, it’s just one member. What Dre was telling me was that I don’t have to reach to get the audience to come [expletive] with me. They’ll come to me. But I was like, I need this other thing. I had worked out and I got myself into a good space physically. I needed the female audience to feel like they could fix me.
When I listened to great albums, they’ve had emotional moments. With Biggie, it’s “____ You Tonight” featuring R. Kelly. It would create a tone shift on a rapper’s album more like rapping as the feature on someone else’s R&B song. Like Dre specifically, that record, “21 Questions,” he was like, I don’t know why you want it. I hear it. It’s good, but you don’t need it.
The hardest person you could have a melody on a record was Nate Dogg. Nate Dogg will [expletive] you up! Having Nate was the coolest way to make a record like that still feel really hard, and for you not to question it.
I was creatively in pocket on the first record. But I became a star during the second album. The second album is when I found this new value for myself. I started feeling like a bad bitch.
I’ll tell you something that Michael Jackson taught me. Because he was talking to Chris Tucker, and he was a big fan of the actual music. And he was like, you know what, he has good melodies. Like, the way I would say things in the choruses and stuff like that. And that’s what is allowing it to connect internationally, where English is people’s second language. They only can follow the melody.
I think in general, the culture loves things that are damaged, because it makes the audience feel better about themselves, looking at somebody like, they’re more [expletive] up than I am. It allows parts of the audience to go on a safari. To be close enough to the animals and not actually be in danger.
GUCCI MANE
I remember buying my first $5 cassette tape, 2 Live Crew, from the flea market in Alabama. I was like 6 or 7. I didn’t even know what the music was about, that cover was just so raunchy to me. My mama found the tape and played it on the porch in front of her friends to embarrass me — like, “Look what Radric’s listening to.” But I only bought it for the cover.
I moved to Atlanta when I was 9. My brother was listening to the gritty underground Atlanta stuff, the gritty Memphis stuff, New Orleans, so that’s what I gravitated towards — Kingpin Skinny Pimp, Triple Six Mafia, the Hot Boys and Master P.
By the time I started trying to finance my own first tape, maybe ’99 or 2000, those were the key people I could relate to — B.G., Project Pat. Like, OK, this dude just got out of jail, and everybody in the hood listens to that. I’m going through the same things at the same time.
I didn’t feel like Project Pat was the best rapper, but he made me feel him. I’m like, can’t be Fabolous or Lil Wayne, but I can do this. I was late in the game, but I didn’t have to be scared to try. I was going to spring break in Daytona, and it was the whole summer of Project Pat and Big Tymers. I started doing the stuff they were rapping about — like, I’m going to be the CD that I’m listening to.
That’s really how this started. It wasn’t even a love of hip-hop; I’m a hustler. I’m like, damn, I really don’t want to sell dope all the time. It’s too risky. If Jermaine Dupri can put out Kris Kross, Birdman ain’t really a good rapper and I got a little money — I can get in this.
I was always thinking, none of this matters if I go to the club and I ain’t got no movement. I’d seen rappers try to get their music out, but they looked lame and no one took them seriously. I was like, “How can I get the whole apartments on Bouldercrest to come with me?” I knew I was popular, I was already going to the club, and I leveraged that. It really was calculated.
My first album came out in 2005. I think 50 Cent dropped his in 2003. He was just super hot. The same stuff he was talking about, I was really having those beefs. It ain’t even nothing to glorify, but that’s what was going on for me, for real. That was my soundtrack, and it really emboldened me to talk with urgency about the stuff I’m doing.
That was at a time when I was heavily in the streets, and I was heavily paranoid about what I had did. I was riding back and forth to Alabama trapping and I had two CDs — Lil Jon’s CD, “Kings of Crunk,” and “Get Rich or Die Tryin’.” That was my inspiration: “I just have to get past this stage.” I moved fully back to Atlanta in 2004, and maybe two weeks later, I made “Black Tee.”
Gucci in ’06, I just was whoever I was 24/7, a lot of times to my detriment. But that’s who I was as a 26-year-old guy trying to be an artist, one foot in and one foot out. My peak came later because I was locked up. But the business was in a better place when I got out, and I benefited from that.
People would never think that a rapper in his 40s would be as in demand. But I’m making way more money than I thought. I never could travel until I was 37, 38 years old. I’m glad I don’t have to do a show in the hood all the time, like I was doing. I know the chitlin circuit. I’m so glad I got over a lot of hurdles, where now I can do a show internationally and get the type of money I felt like I deserved.
Being in Iceland was definitely one of those moments. I had a concert at a festival. The sun didn’t even go down the whole day. That was the craziest thing I’ve ever seen — and it was fun. I never would have thought that it would be something I’d like. I used to tell people, “I don’t want to go nowhere but East Atlanta and right back to the studio.” But damn, it was way better than sitting in that cell.
DJ HOLLYWOOD
The beginnings of what hip-hop is was called non-syncopated rap, meaning that they had a lot of rap, but people weren’t doing it to the track. They had a jazz beat going or some kind of miscellaneous beat that didn’t drive the words. Whatever they were talking about, it had to be really, really tight and interesting, or nobody wouldn’t listen to it. So some of these cats was like the Last Poets, Rudy Ray Moore, Blowfly, Jocko Henderson, Pigmeat Markham, Oscar Brown Jr., Hank Spann. A turntable wasn’t involved.
When the turntable became involved is basically where I step in and started adding the lyrics to a record. I got my first job in ’71. Once I got the mixer with the headphones, it changed the game.
Records back in the day, there was an A section, a B section and a break. I’m the voice. And then I get my voice out right in time for the guy that starts singing. As long as I’m complementing the music, I’m in it. Not only did you get the great record, but you got the great introduction to the record as it came on, you know?
I was a singer before this all happened. I began to sing everything I said — “If I was snow, I would be cold/If I was a jug of wine, I would be old” — and that’s what made it harmonious.
I didn’t call it rapping. I was just entertaining. It was new, it was fresh. A lot of people was like, “Yo, could somebody tell this [expletive] to shut up. Let the record play!” I went through the wire with this. It wasn’t all sweet. But I managed to stand my ground.
After the blackout in ’77, everybody and they mama had some equipment — microphones and turntables and stuff — and they all started to get into the game. I had the blueprint of what a person should be doing, and mostly everybody, they were sounding just like me. A lot of the guys were using my same lines to get their thing on, you know what I mean?
I’m the creator of the style. I’m the creator of the colorful words over music to make people enjoy themselves. Because the first raps was about enjoying yourself. Then it got political and then it got to your neighborhood, then it got to the stickup man and then it got to the sexy, all that came after. But at the beginning, it was basically just to have a good time.
I saw people putting out records, but what they’re doing is slightly different. But I had a big head. Like, get out the way — this is Hollywood!
I was high. I was a lunatic for a while. When you high, you don’t give a [expletive] about nothing. And that’s how I got left behind. ’Cause I was fired up and then being fired up inside my head, like there’s nothing better than me. I’m not ashamed. That’s what happened and that’s how it went.
I was high for a long time. I was high in the ’80s, too. I was on cocaine at first and then I moved to the crack. I can’t blame what happened on anybody other than me. Don’t have a soul in the world that I can say, man, y’all didn’t do me right, y’all didn’t look out for me. And I know plenty of people that could have, plenty of people that should have.
I didn’t make the money that they’re making now, but at the time I was making more money than anybody. I had limousines, I had my own Cadillac. I was doing very well, but I was getting high at the same time, so I was spending my money frivolously.
Everything that I ever owned, it just went. I lost the apartment, so all the stuff that I accumulated there is gone. And I did that over and over and over.
The whole 50 years of hip-hop that they’re promoting right now, it’s not about dudes from where I’m at. It’s for dudes from the ’80s. I look around, man, there’s 7,000 legends. Where’d they come from? How? What did you do to be a legend? This little period of 50 years of hip-hop and they’re honoring it, if it goes past and I get nothing out of it, then I don’t know what to do from there.
I can’t beat myself up. I got clean toward the ’90s. All I want to do is find me a spot where they let me play. I’m trying to see right now how I can change my life from here. The whining, I ain’t never do that. Me cracking myself over the head, I’m not going to do that. I’m sorry I didn’t catch on, but I mean, it wasn’t no thing to me. I really didn’t have that period where I was so sad that it wasn’t me. Because I’m in all of them. I’m in their DNA.
MC LYTE
In Spanish Harlem, where my grandmother lived, my older cousins were playing cassette tapes: the Cold Crush Brothers, Funky 4 + 1, Sha-Rock, Treacherous Three, Sugarhill Gang, Kurtis Blow. I remember one of my cousins used to date his brother, and that was a big deal.
The Sequence was definitely an influence to hear — Angie B, Blondy and Cheryl, how they all attack, like very differently from one another, but were laid back with it. That laid-back way became a part of the way that I stepped to a microphone. And of course, Salt-N-Pepa, they definitely were a guiding force for me. I learned all of the words to their records as I began to practice for who it is that I was going to become.
Run-DMC, Melle Mel — the message of “The Message” really helped me. I was already writing stories, because my mother insisted I write essays for everything. So to be able to hear about this place that I had never been. I had never been to the Bronx. I was just Brooklyn and Manhattan. As far as I knew, 138th Street was the last stop on the train.
I never considered myself a rapper. I was an MC, and an MC, to me, is very different from a rapper. Like an MC is, you know, Nas, versus someone who is not an MC, but had a rap record, and that would be Hammer. He wasn’t in there to show his skills off as an MC, he was in there to make a hit song. Just because you rap doesn’t make you a rapper. But that’s just me.
I happen to like a lot of what the female MCs are doing now, and I listen to everything — I’m a DJ. I’m not just an ’80s, ’90s DJ. I like “Plan B” by Megan Thee Stallion. I like Megan’s register. I’m a fan of Remy Ma. The way that she rhymes, she makes you feel it, just like Lil’ Kim. Just like Foxy. Foxy, Lil’ Kim and myself, we’re all from Brooklyn.
I like this new one by Coi Leray, where she uses that “Message” sample. I like Latto when she used Mariah’s sample. It just feels like a return to something heavy and loaded, and I like when I can feel the depth in someone’s voice.
I’m a fan of Rapsody. I love what she talks about. Just the awareness and acknowledgment of love and womanhood and Blackness. Tierra Whack. Nobody’s messing with that freestyle, she’s just bananas with it. And of course, Cardi and Nicki. Baby Tate. It’s like so many MCs on the scene. Lady London. Oh my goodness, she brings it. You’re talking about college-educated, and not afraid to flip some words on you that you got to go look up.
No one rolled over and started rapping by themselves. Everybody was inspired by somebody. Whether they want to come clean about that or not is a different situation.
LIL WAYNE
The New Orleans hip-hop scene was way more captivating than the worldwide hip-hop scene, because it was more in your face. Our local radio stations, they favored our artists, so our Top 10 songs would always be full of New Orleans. You’d probably get a Billboard No. 1 hip-hop song thrown in there at, like, No. 8.
Our block parties were a bit different; they were more like a concert. There’s a big crowd, there’s a DJ and there’s a microphone, but it’s not for the DJ. The DJ would introduce the artist coming on, and it was up to that artist to keep the party going.
All these names are a chain link to me getting a deal: This first artist, his name was Roni. Roni was one of the best. He reminded me of Juvenile a lot. His niche was finding a way to tell you exactly what he’s doing every day — walking to the damn corner store — and he found a way to make you love it, feel like you could relate to it, like you just took that same walk. He’d go through his day and people would love it.
You could get a recorded tape of that whole block party, sold after it was over. I would only want to hear Roni’s part, backwards and forwards, over and over and over. He was from my hood, but he was a grown-ass man, so he didn’t know too much about me.
From the other side of my hood, there was another guy named Lil Slim and he was a bit different. He talked about the hood, and the hood only. I meshed those two guys together, and I couldn’t wait to get my opportunity.
I was every bit of 9, 8 years old. Thank God I was always a smart kid in school, so I was interested in words, always interested in words. Never knew why; I still don’t. I always was the main person in the play. Whatever it was, from “Les Miserables” to “Wizard of Oz.” I want the main role. I couldn’t wait till the day that damn DJ gave me the mic. It was over.
I was probably around 10, 11 when they had the station called the Box. People were ordering videos, so you had to watch 1,000 videos you don’t want to watch, but once or twice you’ll see something on there that you didn’t know too much about. That was my real introduction to being actually interested in other music other than New Orleans music.
I fell in love with New York artists, anybody from the East Coast. They was making more of their words to me. You had people like Q-Tip and Busta, way before the “Gimme Some More” swag — just a backpack, big old jacket on, spitting. I was interested in artists that took on a character. The reason why I don’t read comic books or watch cartoons or believe in superheroes like my other friends was because I’m getting the same thrill out of hip-hop.
I fell in love with Onyx, because I believed they woke up in the morning screaming at each other. And still my favorite artist, Missy Elliott. You know when you’re watching a sport and you’re like, this person is just too cold, too damn good and they can do whatever they want? She was that person to me.
Before there was Drake and people who were rapping and singing, Missy was doing that. That captivated me, and I was moved by that. It made me want to do it. That’s why I loved Drake when I met Drake. If you’re around me, you know for a fact that if you’ve got a little harmony, a little melody in your voice, I’m about to make you sing.
To me, Shawn Carter, Jay-Z, was the god of words. He could’ve rewritten English books. I was introduced to Jay by listening to Biggie. “Lucky Me,” from “In My Lifetime, Vol. 1,” I learned backward and forward. I put it in songs, and I actually start off every show, still, saying words from that song: “And I swear to everything when I leave this earth/it’s gon’ be on both feet, never knees in the dirt/you could try me, [expletive]/but when I squeeze it hurts/fine …” And what’s crazy is we stop the music on that part and the crowd sings the rest of it with me as if I wrote that. But that’s all Jay.
When it comes to B.G., he’s very significant, very specific, because we put songs together -together. That was back when I actually put words on paper. I know exactly his writing style, his technique. It’s impossible for some of that not to rub off on you. But I don’t write anymore.
I was probably about 16, 17 — this is before internet and all that — when I heard a nugget that Jay wasn’t writing. And I didn’t want to ever see a pen or paper again in my life. Jay was my Bible.
Back then, whoever the star was, they would always take on this young protégé. I would always look to that person. When Jay did it, I would look to Bleek. If I’m listening to Puff, I would look to Mase, or I would look for Jada. It was the humility of the big dog to set up a path for the next person to be bigger. And so that’s why I made sure when I got the chance, I was going to run with it.
Nicki Minaj was always into my wording technique, the way I come up with the verse. “Why?” “But why?” “OK, but why?” She’s that kid. She was set on, “I’m the female Weezy.” Nick would change her voice like me, she would actually sound like me sometimes.
Drizzy’s just Drizzy. That “good boy, bad boy, I was on the TV show, but I wish you would play with me” type of stuff.
I was scared, actually, when I called Eminem for a song. That is a monster. He must have the same thing I have with words. Like, we can’t get them out of our heads. Every meaning, every aspect of them. Things that rhyme, we hear it. I already know the gift and the curse that he has. And I love to hear the way he puts it together.
When I was on “The Tonight Show,” I was playing Pictionary. And my thing was Harry Potter. So I drew a pot, and they got that. I drew a man with a face, and I put a bunch of hair around him. They were like, “Wait, he’s hairy.” I’m, like, Harry Potter . We plan our words. At all times.
AZEALIA BANKS
I’ve made a special contribution to hip-hop, and I feel like that gets overlooked a lot of times. Hip-hop is Black culture. People say, “Oh, you make house music, aka white people music.” I’m like, honey, no. House music is Black music. Everything I do is in the spirit of hip-hop.
My first memory of hip-hop, even though I had no clue what was going on, was O.D.B. on Mariah Carey’s “Fantasy” remix. I was like 2, going on 3. And Lil’ Kim’s verse on “All About the Benjamins.” The audacity was just so fab. I remember the video with the fisheye lens, the see-through dress and the blonde wig. And she started off with: “What the bloodclaat?/Wanna bumble with the bee, huh?/Throw a hex on the whole family.” I didn’t know what a hex was until I was maybe 16, but I could spit that [expletive] word for word.
I was a theater kid, and Lil Wayne, for sure, was like a thespian. It was theatrical and the jokes were funny . “Cannon” is probably one of the best Lil Wayne verses ever. [Raps “Cannon” for 30 seconds]
But my favorite rapper of all time is Styles P, from hearing the Lox at block parties. Then we had the DatPiff era, so I would download like, “Ghost in the Machine.” I just like how unrehearsed he is. And the swag. He was talking to you rather than trying to create a fantastical world.
We actually have a song together on my first mixtape. He did it for free. I’ve done collabs with other male rappers that will probably never see the light of day because I wouldn’t sign their record deal. Like, damn, Yeezy — I loved you my entire life and that’s what you do?
I started rapping because I had this boyfriend who rapped and they would do these cyphers. If your bars were wack, they would, like, snatch the blunt from you, you know? I skipped the cypher for like two weeks and I came back with a vengeance. I had to learn all these different words for “firearm.” I wrote “Seventeen” over that Ladytron beat and when they passed me the blunt that day, I came out with: “I’m not the don diva/I’m beyond ya don skeezers/I get cake from quick chicks with long heaters.” They was like, “Ohhhhhh. Shorty, you can rap! You should record that!”
The very first record that I ever recorded was into a microphone in a sock in this guy’s closet, in between all these Supreme jackets. Two weeks later, I was featured on the Fader blog. I blew up overnight and then it was just kind of like, OK, I have a job to do now.
I think that all of that theatrical training definitely helped. When it came to “212,” that white girl Valley Girl voice, I was really just making fun of dumb bitches who come to New York for like two years and are like, I’m a New Yorker !
I think that everyone at XL Recordings forgot that I was 17. I felt like there was no mentorship. Everybody just kind of abandoned me and expected me to know what they wanted.
At the same time, they had just signed Odd Future, who were super, super duper crass. I won’t lie — I was so jealous just watching them put all this love into Odd Future. Just to see them be given the support to be kids. It’s a classic tale of boys can do whatever they want, but girls need to be like, prim and proper. I sent “212” in to XL and they dropped me. It was 100% a bunch of misogynoir.
I was thinking maybe I should go get a GED and go to college. Then I just get this phone call from Nick Grimshaw on BBC Radio 1, and he’s played it like a million times. I didn’t even know what BBC Radio 1 was. And then very quickly you go from getting paid $150 and a bottle of Smirnoff to perform to getting like, 5,000 euros at some weird charity event. I’d never had 5,000 anything all at once in my hands, ever. All I could think was, I’m going to get a weave and a laptop.
One thing leads to another, and then I’m at Karl Lagerfeld’s house. I didn’t even know who Karl Lagerfeld was when he invited me to perform at his house in Paris. I didn’t know what Coachella was when I got booked for Coachella. That Coachella date in 2012, it was like, all right, I’m here. I’m a star.
Jimmy Iovine, the very first day I met him, he said to me, “The best thing you can do for a woman is get the [expletive] out of her way.” He actually bought me my first, like, three pairs of Louboutins, my first Chanel bag, my first real bottle of perfume. He was always a gentleman and he always thought my jokes were funny.
“212” was such an anomaly that no one has been able to successfully build upon it outside of me. What I see is people doing an Azealia Banks impression, and that is partially due to just the belief that a woman couldn’t be the mastermind behind the sound, the aesthetic, the everything. I’m still alive, girls.
There’s no magic in hip-hop now. Hip-hop has been taken from us and used as a weapon against us. No one is talking about anything. Just for the record: All these little new rap girls — they really suck.
LIL B
In 2003, I wrote a book report in middle school that was about hip-hop. That’s as real as it gets, man. From a middle-school me: “Hip-hop to me is an art form, a style, a genre, an influence and a lifestyle. It’s a different type of music style that does not sound like any other type of music. It’s like a baggy, nice, shiny type of clothing.”
I’m walking the beach right now, and I’ve also got an article that I tore out of XXL magazine in 2005, about when Lil Wayne performed at Club Speed, Dec. 19, 2004. It’s hilarious because you’re talking about 500-plus attendees. Now obviously Wayne can do stadiums. That’s my early motivation. Ain’t it crazy later I made the XXL freshmen list? These papers I’ve saved have been through fires. It’s very, very personal to me.
Gucci Mane, Lil Wayne, you know, they set the bar. They set the bar still to this day. It was so much inspiration out here in the Bay, too, from E-40, Too Short, Mistah F.A.B., Turf Talk, Keak da Sneak, listening to 106 [KMEL], listening to Wild 94.9. I feel like I really seen it from a unique perspective.
You’ve got to realize, there was a time where I was the only one doing what I was doing. I was outside at a time when people were saying music was dead, and I was still pushing. It hurt my heart when Nas said hip-hop was dead, and I made it my mission to make sure hip-hop stayed alive. This was before the iPhone.
Just hearing my mom and my dad say they’re proud of me, knowing they have seen me do my thing independently, unsigned. It’s 40, Short, Master P and myself, Brandon McCartney. We did the Jive Records thing with the Pack. I’ve been doing my own thing ever since. I’ve been managing Lil B.
Soulja Boy is a real legend and an inspiration, a pioneer with the music, early on YouTube. He was really at the anime store back then, you know what I’m saying? He don’t get no credit for that. It’s a lot of hype around anime now, but he was going to the store early.
I always looked at myself as giving out swag. I say that humbly. There’s people that have the fire that I see. I appreciate Lil Yachty — he was always holding it down and then taking his career to a whole ’nother level, showing me what’s possible, doing Sprite deals. Future, Tyler, the Creator. Chief Keef — I was changing the game with the music video stuff on YouTube and then he took it the next level. Now I could be influenced off Playboi Carti, you know what I’m saying? And Young Thug took it to the next level.
I’ve still got a lot of homework to do with this hip-hop, right? I need to do my homework on De La Soul. I need to do my homework on Slum Village. I’ve got to really do my Public Enemy homework, you know? What’s the gentleman’s name — MC Serch and his group? A little bit of Beastie Boys homework. It’s so many beautiful people that’s added to this genre and to the culture.
E-40
I call myself the greatest game-spitter of all time. A game-spitter is somebody that spit that slang, the street [expletive], all angles. I might touch down on a pimp. I might touch down on being over the stove, twisting the pot counterclockwise, serving the dope wet. I might talk about when a guy about to get jacked, or about to pull a lick, or when he’s going to get his head tore off, you know? It was whole ’nother angle of the game that the Bay Area was on back then.
I was the first rapper talking about zippers — calling ounces “zippers,” that’s 28 grams. I was the first one calling them “units.” I was the first rapper screaming “choppers” — it came from Chicago, from Al Capone. I could document all that. Everybody’s saying “slaps” — I brought that to the rap game. It came from me, Earl Stevens, E-40, hands down.
So many things didn’t come out of my brain; it came from the streets. When rappers are from the urban community, they talk about their surroundings and what they done picked up here and there — in the pen, wherever they at. That’s me.
In Oakland in the ’80s, the local D-boy would have enough gouda to shoot Too Short some money — it could’ve been $500, it could’ve been a thou-wow — to make a song just about them. Calvin T and Magic Mike, from Richmond, Calif., they were doing the same thing. These are local songs circulating through dubbed tapes. They were a big influence on me.
And Ice-T. He was speaking a language that most of us was living. People don’t give him enough credit. We have a mutual love and respect for each other because game recognize game. He seen my whole hustle in the underground, selling tapes out the trunk of a car.
I was a rapper that invested in myself. We was doing this when Moby Dick was a goldfish. A&Rs didn’t get what we was talking about. A lot of times it would go over their head like a flying saucer, you know what I’m saying? That’s just the same as out there with 8Ball & MJG, Master P. Everybody was doing it independently. When we did independent music we did it by force, not by choice. I signed my distribution deal with Jive Records in 1994. The whole Bay Area followed my blueprint after that.
When I came out with “Ghetto Report Card,” I was 37, 38 years old. My whole career was just revived. It was amazing. I was part of the crunk movement and the hyphy movement at the same time. “U and Dat,” “Snap Yo Fingers” and so on. We had the South and the West Coast.
Imagine if there was streaming back then when we had “Tell Me When to Go,” “Bitch,” “Choices.” We would be diamond on each one of those records. I put new life into the West Coast in 2006. And that’s no ifs, ands or buts. Can’t nobody say I didn’t, with the help of Lil Jon. And it’s never stopped since then.
That’s my role — they call me the Ambassador of the Bay. And I don’t know nobody else there that represents it like me.
EMINEM
My Uncle Ronnie had the “Breakin’” soundtrack. I was, like, 11 years old, and he played me Ice-T’s “Reckless” before I’d seen the movie. Uncle Ronnie used to breakdance and he taught me a little bit, showing me some moves. From that moment I knew there was nothing else — no other kind of music that I would ever like again — aside from rap.
We used to bounce back and forth from Missouri, and shortly after that we moved to Detroit, and we were staying at my Grandma Nan’s house. I had a tape player, and I found WJLB. There was this DJ named the Wizard. He would play from, like, 10 to 11. I would just hit record on my tape and I’d go to sleep and get up for school to see what I got: “Go See the Doctor,” Kool Moe Dee, UTFO. I just wanted everything — give me everything that rap has: Run-DMC, Fat Boys, LL.
Every time LL dropped something it was, like, he was the best, no one’s touching him. LL Cool J was everything to everybody. You know, I always wanted a Kangol.
My first rap, I was 12-ish, when LL Cool J, “Bad,” came out. I would be, like, just walking around my Aunt Edna’s house, thinking of rhymes and writing thoughts down. It was a complete LL bite, but it was something that I dabbled in. I would be sitting in school sometimes and a line would hit me.
And then Run-DMC would drop a new album and you’d be, like, “This is the craziest [expletive] I’ve ever heard.” “Yo, this is as good as rap can get, lyrically.” And then Rakim changed the way people thought about rap.
It just kept advancing to the next level. I was there to watch its conception and its growth. Everybody was trying to one-up each other. It went from rhyming one- or two-syllable words to rhyming four and five and six. Then Kool G Rap came along and he would rhyme seven, eight, nine, 10.
But I was a sponge. I would gravitate towards the compound-syllable rhyming, like the Juice Crew. Lord Finesse, to Kool G Rap, to Big Daddy Kane, to Masta Ace, Redman, Special Ed. I don’t even think I understood why I liked it. I had a couple of friends that had to point out to me how many syllables somebody was rhyming.
And then Treach from Naughty by Nature came along and he was doing all that, too. He was cool, too — his image and everything. I wanted to be him. When the first Naughty by Nature album dropped, that whole summer, I couldn’t write a rap. “I’ll never be that good; I should just quit.” I was so depressed, but that’s all I played for that summer. Proof thought Treach was the best rapper, too. Every time he would drop an album I would just be, like, Son of a bitch.
Nas, too. I remember The Source gave “Illmatic” five mics. I already knew I liked Nas from “Live at the Barbeque” with Main Source, because his verse on that is one of the most classic verses in hip-hop of all time. But I was, like, “Five mics, though? Let me see what this is.”
And when I put it on, “And be prosperous/though we live dangerous/Cops could just arrest me/Blamin’ us/We’re held like hostages.” He was going in and outside of the rhyme scheme, internal rhymes. That album had me in a slump, too. I know the album front to back.
There was three or four years, maybe, where I kind of dipped out of listening to rap. I was so on the grind in the underground. I didn’t have money to buy any tapes. Every dollar, every dime that I had went to either studio time or to buy Hailie diapers.
Tuesday night I would go to the Ebony Showcase on Seven Mile. Wednesday night would be Alvin’s. Friday night would be Saint Andrew’s. And then Saturday would be the Hip Hop Shop.
Proof was hosting open mics at the Hip Hop Shop, and they started having battles. The first one that I got in — it was actually the first battle there — I won. And then the second battle, I won it again. I realized maybe I should try to go out of state. So I would hop in the car with friends and drive down to Cincinnati for the Scribble Jam.
Back then, you had to go off the top of the head. If you didn’t you’d get booed offstage. So I learned from watching Proof that you can freestyle, but just have a couple lines in the back of your head, a couple of punchlines you know you want to use, and then freestyle around that.
Coming up in the battle scene was the greatest thing to happen to me because I knew what lines were going to get a reaction from the crowd. That’s what I would focus on. So when I got signed with Dre, I was trying to translate that to record, to get that reaction. I would picture the listener sitting there and what lines they might react to. I just used that as a formula. Like, “How you gonna breastfeed, Mom?/You ain’t got no tits.”
When the first Onyx album dropped, Sticky Fingaz was so great at saying that kind of [expletive]: “I’m thinking about taking my own life/I might as well, except they might not sell weed in hell.” And Bizarre was really great at that. If we reacted to it, then we thought other people would, too. That shaped my whole career, you know?
BUN B
When I was young, I was immersing myself in the music, but I don’t actually want to become an MC until “Microphone Fiend.” And this is after I fall in love with the Juice Crew — Kool G Rap, Big Daddy Kane became huge influences on me. I’m writing rhymes at this time. The “Microphone Fiend” video comes on “Rap City,” and that’s when I decide I really want to be a rapper, ’cause this is the coolest [expletive] I’ve ever seen in my life, and I really want to be seen as this cool.
You don’t really start hearing Houston hip-hop until KTSU starts playing it. That’s the radio station for Texas Southern University. There were guys like R.P. Cola, Billy Dee, these were the guys that were actually in the clubs having freestyle battles. Around that same time as Akshen, but that’s still very under the radar. “Another Head Put to Rest,” that’s not playing on the radio. It’s too much cursing. You hear “Car Freak” and stuff like that, but it really doesn’t come together until the Geto Boys “Balls and My Word.” That’s when the idea of making music and putting it out was not as far-fetched as it seemed.
I start writing about ’88. Juice Crew, Rakim, that’s the technical level at which I’m aspiring to operate. The use of metaphors, manipulating the English language, rhyming mid-word, putting together as many similar-sounding words as possible. And I feel like I should be pretty good at it because I’m pretty good at school, right? I make really good grades in English. I know more words than most of my friends. I should be able to figure out how to incorporate some of that into rhymes. I tried it initially, it was terrible. Like [expletive] would’ve had to literally sit down and get a dictionary. And people don’t really want to do that.
A lot of this realization is Pimp’s influence on me. He was like, man, this [expletive] gotta jam. People gotta be able to see theyself when they see you and hear theyself when they hear you. If you want to be good on a technical level and compare your rhymes to rocket ships and cellular biology or molecular biology or whatever, that’s cool. But at the end of the day, people gotta dance to that [expletive].
When we first started putting out music, I say there might have been 50 rappers in all of Houston at the time. But when we first went to New York in ’92 to sign with Jive, the first three white people we met in New York were rappers. Like the bellman: “So what are you guys doing here? You rap? Oh man, I’m a rapper!” Pizza guy: “You’re here to sign a record deal? Put me on, I’m a rapper.” The driver the next day: “You guys rap, I guess? You’re going to the Jive building. I do a little something-something.” And all of these guys white! The weed guy was like, “You guys are rappers? I rap too.” And he was white as well.
In the earliest years of my career, I wanted to try to vocalize how hard I felt I was and how tough I felt I was. I eventually realized it was not about being the hardest, it was really about being just hard enough and being able to be enough of what was needed in that room at that time.
So if I’m in a room with a bunch of Ruthless Records [expletive], there’s a certain way I gotta move and carry myself, but eventually when I get to the mic, everybody understands who we are. Same thing would happen if I would’ve ended up in a room with Q-Tip and Busta in ’92. There’s certain assumptions that people are gonna draw about each other. And when I actually show my talent, that’s the unifying point.
I was fascinated by wordplay and that was the dominant style of music coming from the East Coast. But then I’m also from a very small town. There’s a lot of gangster [expletive] going on in my town. Crack is coming into the city. And so I know that if I rap, I also have to be a reflection of that.
At one point I hear this song, Volume 10’s “Pistolgrip-Pump,” which sonically sounds nothing like us, much less anything at the time. The beat was dope. Then I hit the hook and I’m like, wait a minute, that’s me. It’s from one of my lines in “Pocket Full of Stones.” I never asked for a dime. I didn’t think that rappers charged other rappers. When I heard it, I was more like, damn, they know my [expletive] on the West Coast! And then he gets on another record and is like, “‘Pistolgrip’ was a hit!/UGK, I’d like to say what’s up.” I’m like, this is crazy!
We met Biggie in ’94. We’re on promo with Jive Records, and this is literally within three to five days of Craig Mack’s “Flava in Ya Ear” going gold. So we’re there, Craig’s there, Big’s there, and everybody’s really fawning over Craig Mack. But obviously we wanted to meet Biggie.
We go over and we introduce ourselves and he’s like, “I know who y’all are. Y’all are on the ‘Menace’ soundtrack. Y’all got the ‘Pockets’ joint — I was out there with Eiht, I told him y’all got the best record on the soundtrack.”
We were very flattered and taken aback at that. And keep in mind, this is when we’re in possession of the bootleg from Biggie, but I’m trying not to allude to that. I don’t know how he might receive it.
We had weed, we offered to smoke with him. So we go out to the car to smoke and I offer him the front seat and he’s like, nah, I’m gonna sit in the back if that’s OK. And he never closes the door on the car. I’m trying to hotbox, right? I’m trying to get the doors closed, get the windows up, but he’s not going for it. And come to find out, ’cause he didn’t really know us like that, he didn’t want to sit in the front seat ’cause he didn’t want dudes he didn’t know behind him. And he needed the door open because he would need a little bit of a head start if he needed to make a quick getaway.
KOOL KEITH
I was a popular dancer in high school and I saw rap from the B-boy stance when rap was being plugged up into the streetlights. When I was going to school, the Cold Crush Brothers were going to school with me. It wasn’t until the mid-80s that I started rapping, which turned into Ultramagnetic MCs.
I met Ced Gee when we were going to high school together and we formed the group. We listened to the Treacherous Three, who would use a lot of big words in their raps. They were using words nobody was using. We looked at the Treacherous Three like, This is the point of hip-hop. I want to rhyme like this. I don’t want to do the “Yes, yes y’all, ya don’t stop the body rock!” They put pen to paper. Now rap was about vocabulary. It was no longer baby rhymes.
T La Rock was one of the most high-tech rappers at that time with the technical words. I was hanging with Greg Nice. We had a chance to see everybody from the super old-school acts all the way up to Spoonie Gee, Run-DMC and Whodini. They were all out with records before we even had a deal.
At the time there was a craze happening where everyone was using TV-show themes. So we waited for that craze to go by and that’s when rap started going heavy with the samples. It became MC Shan, Eric B. & Rakim and then Ultra. So when “Ego Trippin’” came out, that was like the third record that shocked everybody like, Wow, this is different!
We pressed up 500 copies of “Ego Trippin’.” We hit Red Alert off, and I delivered the records straight to Marley Marl’s house. I remember Big Daddy Kane was in the kitchen. That’s where Marley had his mic set up.
Marley was really open to it. He spun it on WBLS. And then I gave Chuck Chillout a copy in person. I remember me and Funkmaster Flex used to talk in his car about different rappers.
To be honest, a lot of rappers were jealous of Ultramagnetic MCs, but when “Ego Trippin’” came out, there was nothing you could do because every car had it playing up and down the block. You would hear it in every project. All you would hear is “MC’s Ultra! MC’s Ultra!” everywhere you went. I would go through the projects and people would scream and we didn’t even have a video out. I wasn’t popular on TV. I don’t know how people had a vision of knowing a person without even seeing them on social media, on Instagram. Back then it was more about the flyers and posters and people seeing you on a show with Boogie Down Productions.
If you listen to the second verse of “Ego Trippin’,” I was just making the words fit on a beat. I wasn’t trying to rhyme: “Through the scientific matter I probe for evidence/Leading melodies obtaining slight positive beams/Of the average formulation, apply mechanically.” And people didn’t even know what I was doing because the first verse of the record was more straight rap. The beat was so hot and the chorus was so dramatic that you didn’t even realize the second verse didn’t rhyme.
At that time, I liked Lakim Shabazz. I liked Latee’s “This Cut’s Got Flavor” and stuff like that. But once we were out, I tried not to follow rap in a lyrical way because I thought that if I listened to everybody’s rhymes a lot, I wouldn’t have my own originality. I used to buy funk records like Con Funk Shun because I was a dancer. I bought Undisputed Truth and Cameo. My main inspiration was Slave. That’s why Ultra’s music was like that. I didn’t grow up on jazz. I didn’t know about Ron Carter or Ronnie Laws.
When I started the Dr. Octagon project, I had so much material piled up that I had to break it up into different characters. People thought I was just being weird, but I was being a businessman. A lot of artists were stuck as just one person. They had to do a record deal with that same style again. But I had a lot of ideas. I think that’s why Parliament-Funkadelic opened my mind up. They had Brides of Funkenstein, they had Sir Nose, Funkadelic and Parliament. George Clinton broke his group up into so many different parts. So that’s what I felt like: a one-person Parliament-Funkadelic.
During that time, I tended to like the peculiar people. I liked the artists that had flows, like Fiend and Mac from No Limit. But a lot of the rappers couldn’t adapt to different sounds. That made me feel like, OK, I’m going to create a Dr. Octagon. I’m going to create a Dr. Dooom. I’m going to create a Black Elvis. But all of those characters are part of me.
KRAYZIE BONE
My first memory of hip-hop was when my older brother brought home the LL Cool J “Radio” tape. I remember him coming in the house and he threw the tape on the bed and was like, “You don’t know nothing about this.” And I put the tape into the radio and I never took it out. Never took it out, you know what I’m saying? I was like 12, 13. That’s what made me start writing my own raps, because I wanted to learn LL Cool J’s songs. I loved “You’ll Rock.” I still bump that to this day. The beat was hard, the lyrical flow — LL was before his time on that.
So I started writing down his lyrics and I saw the blueprint on how to write a rhyme. I wrote my own one day and I never stopped. All the songs I liked that I wanted to learn, I would write the lyrics down. I liked the continuous flow, like Big Daddy Kane and Biz Markie, Dana Dane and Slick Rick. We never liked when rappers would flow and they would pause and then they would go back.
The Bone Thugs style developed by just basically being in cyphers together. We would smoke weed either in my mother’s basement or at whoever’s house we was at, and we’d just start rhyming, working on our harmonies and everything. We knew each other and we knew we could rhyme but when the other four would say the ad-libs, it would sound like we was harmonizing. It’s nothing we did on purpose — we just started doing it and that was our style one day. We didn’t even know what we had until we would rap for people and they’d be like, “Y’all sound like the rapping Temptations or something.” Then when we got with Eazy-E, he would tell us, “This style is different. Y’all singing like singers, too.”
Before hip-hop, I was a Michael Jackson fanatic. I was a New Edition fanatic. R&B, that’s all my parents played. So I know about all the old-school R&B like the Isley Brothers. We just started mixing in some of those flows. If you listen to “1st of tha Month” and “Days of Our Livez,” we just started picking old-school songs and putting our harmonies to it.
Singers liked what we were doing. When our management got a call about Mariah Carey wanting to do a record with us, at the time, we didn’t even really understand how big Mariah Carey was. We knew of her, but we were so wrapped up in our newfound fame, we were just in our own little world. So, like, we almost didn’t even go. We was on the plane contemplating, about to get off the plane, but something just made us stay on the plane.
When we got there, she said basically she loved our style. She loved our flow, how different it was. I’m glad we didn’t get off the plane.
We also got love from Bobby Womack when he was alive. I got a chance to meet his daughters and they told me, “Yo, my father loved y’all music. He played y’all music all the time. He turned us on to y’all.” That really shocked me. I was like, Wow, the O.G. It made me feel good because I came up loving his music. It was cool to tell my parents, like, “Hey, guess who listens to Bone? Bobby Womack.” My pops was like, “What?!’” He loved that.
FABO
We came up off Michael Jackson, my mama listening to James Brown, my grandpa was really into Curtis Mayfield, my uncle listening to Run-DMC, New Edition. We were singers — I came up in the era where you were still going out there trying to sing to the girl to catch her, you know?
My very first memory of hip-hop was sitting down with my brother, rewinding Bone Thugs-n-Harmony trying to learn “1st of tha Month”: “Wake up, wake up, wake up.” That was when it really hit me, like, this is what I want to do.
I’m from Bankhead, so I seen Kilo, the dope boy in the neighborhood who had made it, in his money-green Cadillac all the time. And I came in the rap game up under Raheem the Dream. These was our local heroes. They mean everything. That was our inspiration, but the world didn’t know them like that.
I was freestyling, winning the local talent show every week. And I started singing this song called “If You’re Down on Your Luck Say (Ow),” and everybody started singing it.
In the apartments, it was me and Young Dro. We ended up sparring against each other all the time, freestyling. This guy takes us down to Raheem the Dream. The rest is history.
When we left Raheem, I went to Shawty Lo. I’m in high school, and I was playing the tenor drums at the time. He was taking care of us. I moved right in and we started recording. He wasn’t a rapper at this time, mind you. Never asked me for rent, never asked me for anything. He did these basketball tournaments where all the neighborhoods would come play each other. That’s what brought a lot of Atlanta together.
When Jeezy and Gucci was going at it — that was when everybody in Atlanta was just, like, boom. I remember being in the club when “Stay Strapped” was out — like, “We need a song.” Killer Mike, T.I., all of them had those songs bunking. That was the moment. The old 112 was just closing down and Visions was the hottest club in Atlanta.
Lo used to always be pushing us. When Dem Franchize Boyz jumped off, I developed my style right there. I was like, they’re trying to rhyme like this, so I’m going to do something totally different. I started yelling and screaming on everything. I was, like, ain’t nobody doing this.
Right to this day, put “Tatted Up” on — you can put it up against any Grammy that’s ever been won. Just the end of the song — [ sings ] “Barbaraaaaaa!” People would be like, “Who is Barbara!?” That’s what I heard in the track, bro.
I’ve always been dancing. When the other guys made “Lean Wit It, Rock Wit It,” I was, like, “No, this is our movement.” I felt like I should’ve been given some type of credit. You can hear me on “Betcha Can’t Do It Like Me” — I felt offended.
I seen them on “Rap City” or something, and they asked who came up with the dance. And this guy goes, “Me.” I leaned back in my chair and was like, “Yo, turn the beat on.” And I got right in the booth. The snap era was intense, the competition.
With “Laffy Taffy” we went straight to MTV — BET wasn’t playing the song. We didn’t understand what crossing over was. We didn’t know that this was another level — like, “You’re No. 1.” I think we wanted to prove for a while that we wasn’t pop.
Anytime you see something that you don’t understand or that’s different, you’re going to look at it with that side-eye, you know? Nas said “hip-hop is dead,” I seen Ghostface Killah imitating the leg thing. But I’m just trying not to eat ketchup sandwiches anymore, dude.
I think when Busta Rhymes kicked it with us and jumped on the album, we started getting a little respect. And then Twista jumped on the record. People was like, “OK, well, these guys must have something.” These are two different characters from two different places that bought into the movement.
Future, Young Thug, all these cats showed me love. Drake, when he put that “snappin’ like you Fabo” in “Nice for What,” bro, my grandmother was like, “Drake said your name!” I’m one of the only artists to have a No. 1 single and have my name called in another No. 1 single.
PITBULL
My first memory of hip-hop would have to be around third grade when I first heard 2 Live Crew. Bass music was basically taking over Miami and, you know, you always wanna listen to what you’re not supposed to be listening to. You could hear it in the corner spots where they were washing cars and the flea markets. Another place where I would find music was this thing called the Box, that was basically something that you could see on local television. At the time that was our MTV before MTV.
But bass music has always been about underground. It’s all about pirate stations. It was all about, No. 1, finding a way to get this music out because nobody would believe in it. No. 2, it was too nasty, too dirty, too raunchy for them. And so we always had to find ways to get this out.
It always feels like we’re the underdogs in Miami, because we’re used to being counted out. Pirate radio, independent labels — that independence allows us to maneuver and navigate differently so we are not, for lack of a better term, choked by a major corporation or company.
I started the whole freestyle thing when I was about 15, 16 years old. I went to a lot of different schools in Miami. Lived in a lot of different neighborhoods, good neighborhoods, bad neighborhoods, worse neighborhoods. And Miami being the melting pot that it is, it allowed me to dibble and dabble in different genres and different cultures. So I could spit at you in English, Spanish, throw some patois at you, throw a little Creole in there as well.
A teacher happened to change my life. Her name is Hope Martinez, and she gave me an invitation to a DMX video shoot. I ended up battling an artist from the Ruff Ryders called Drag-On. It went eight rounds. I did my job, and Irv Gotti pulled me to the side and asked me, “Hey, do you write music?” I said, no, I just freestyle. He said, “Yeah, freestyle is great, but it don’t make no money.”
My brothers had a lot of Eric B. & Rakim, Pete Rock & CL Smooth, Black Moon — they had a lot of hip-hop. But what I really related to is when I heard Nas, “Illmatic,” when he’s using lines like “Got my first piece of ass, smokin’ blunts with hash/Now it’s all about cash in abundance.” You know, these are things I can relate to, these are things going on in my neighborhood.
B.I.G. was such an amazing storyteller. Pac was a revolutionist, Snoop had a flow that you never heard before and Jay-Z was the ultimate hustler-slash-entrepreneur at the time, and I grew up around a lot of entrepreneurs. They had their startups. They were looking for angel investors. They just had a different product. It was called cocaine.
Latins have always been involved in hip-hop, from the days of graffiti and breakdancing. You had your Mellow Man Ace, you had your Kid Frost. You even had Gerardo, which is what really broke Interscope Records. Then you had Cypress Hill, where you had a Mexican and a Cuban represented at the same time. And then you have Fat Joe, and from Fat Joe, you have Big Pun. Pun was arguably one of the best rappers ever in the history of hip-hop. He just didn’t have the time to prove himself.
Now remember I grew up around merengue and salsa. And then around dancehall reggae, and you have reggaeton, all this that you could throw in the pot with rap. I was never afraid to think out of the box. People don’t want to try that because it might mess with their credibility. I say if you’re worried about your credibility, you were never credible in the first place.
The person that really pulled me to the side, this had to be about 2002, was Lil Jon. He said, “You need to rap more in Spanish. I see how you flipping it. I see how you taking it in and out, but you need to rap more in Spanish.” So he’s the one that really saw it and said, there’s gonna be a lane here. And sure enough, the lane exploded, in the middle of hip-hop, crunk and reggaeton. And that’s where I was at.
DJ JUBILEE
I started DJing in 1982. I went to college in ’84. I was on the microphone then. I was doing all the parties in North Louisiana, Grambling State University. But when I graduated and I came home, I started DJing the high school dances. I used to bring local rappers in, but they used to come in cussing so much I couldn’t really put them on the mic because we at a high school dance. So we started making up certain dances after that. When I saw somebody do something, I’d just name it.
A friend of mine named Tyrone Jones had did a slide dance one time, we was at Grambling State University during the homecoming. So when I went back to New Orleans, I started doing the dance and then I just put my name on it. I started saying “do the Jubilee, do the Jubilee.” Then the next week, two other guys in the St. Thomas named Chris and Beanhead, they came and did the Beenie Weenie.
So now every week, somebody come with a different dance. We got different areas bringing up different dances. You got the Magnolia came with the Eddie Bow, the Calliope Projects came with the Jerk, and the St. Thomas came with the Jubilee All, the KC, the Law Law, the Eldon Delloyd, the Sissy Leroy, the Sissy Chris. So we had multiple dances that’s going on every week, and that what’s made my high school dances the livest high school dances during the summertime.
So after that one day I just start making up a rhyme to it. “Stop, pause, stand up tall/Yeah, do the Jubilee, all/Do the Jubilee, all.” And next week, “Stop, pause, pass the towel/Yeah, and do the Eddie Bow.” And before you know it, I had like 26, 27 dances. I was forced to try to get it on an album because when I recorded in the club live, a friend of mine who was another DJ started selling the tape. He got $30!
That’s when DJ Jubilee was born. When I did “Jubilee All” and I dropped the tape, we put out 500 tapes in the stores, they all left the stores in five minutes. People started calling back, “Man, you got more?” So that took me away from the DJing to the music business.
For bounce, there’s the originators: you got TT Tucker, DJ Jimi, Everlasting Hitman, Pimp Daddy. Those was the rappers in the foundation of our music. When I changed the whole game from rapping to dancing, then you had multiple artists that came after me — Choppa, Hot Boy Ronald, Big Freedia, Katey Red.
When I started saying, “Back that thang up, back that thang up,” I didn’t know that that was going to take off like it did. “Get Ready, Ready!” was already hot when my “Back That Thang Up” came out. You know how girls started bending over and then walking up back into you?
Once I hit that chorus line — “First ya wiggle ya leg, cause ya ’bout to get rough/Won’t ya bend it on over/Now back that thang up, back that thang up” — that really influenced the whole city. Women started shaking it even more. But the best part about my stuff there? All of it was made up in the street at a block party. It was made up at a high school dance.
I signed a multimillion-dollar deal with Tommy Boy — 1998, I was hot, they flew me down to Miami, I did the Impact Convention, $100,000 signing bonus. It was supposed to be a seven-album deal, $3 million. I still got the contract. But when I came back a couple of months later, they changed their phone numbers on us. I’m still kind of like puzzled how it happened. I dropped the song in ’98. I was hot all the way through ’98.
When ’99 came around, somebody said Juvenile got a song called “Back That Thang Up.” I didn’t hear it at first, but a kid at the high school played for me. He was shooting a video at City Park in New Orleans, so I went to the video shoot. He had a little rhyme to it and that catch phrase, “back that thang up,” he did it a little different. We went to court. We tried to prove copyright infringement, but they didn’t see it that way. I lost the lawsuit. But I think I really influenced it because he knew my song was the hottest.
His blew up, took off. If you ever noticed, he says, “Cash Money Records taking over for the ’99 and the 2000.” Well, I dropped this in January ’98. But years passed by, we’re still friends today. We still do concerts today. We’re all grown. That was supposed to be my time for me to blow up, to make all my money. But I guess God didn’t plan it that way.
STYLES P
That era, the late ’80s and ’90s, was like the Marvel Universe but for rappers — same universe, different heroes. It felt like we were witnessing the evolution, the growth of this thing we have.
What I felt was always great was the Native Tongues, from De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest to Queen Latifah to Black Sheep. It was always dope to have people — especially during that time period when it was pretty rough in the ’80s, early ’90s — have that amount of confidence to be different. It solidified how dope they were, because most people were just emulating what was hot. I think De La and Tribe was good especially for young fellas on the block who didn’t want to be a drug dealer, you know what I’m saying? To know I could be cool and not be into violence. I thought that that was an important element to add into what was going on.
In our lane, we were looking at Mobb Deep, M.O.P., Wu-Tang, those three immediately come to mind. Nas kind of ushered in our age class, and what was going on with the youth outside during that time period. He was a child of the grandmasters, I would say. He was definitely a product of Kane, Kool G Rap, KRS-One and Rakim, but mixed with what was going on outside at that time. We’re getting cars and chains and nice gear and all of that off of the streets, but we into our rhymes. The Golden Era babies is what I like to call us. I don’t think before that nor after that was ever as competitive as that time period.
Kool G and Kane are on “The Symphony,” but there is no Kane and KRS song, no Kane and Rakim song. In the ’90s, though, you was hopping on verses with each other, you got people from different boroughs, different places. You couldn’t be trash during that era — you was not getting recognized. I would never disrespect those who came before me, but there was people out when Rakim, Kane, Kool G Rap, KRS, EPMD, Jungle Brothers, all of them was out that was absolute trash and still getting recognition, getting honored, getting love. During Mobb Deep, Wu, us, Nas, Hov, Big, Rae, Ghost, you couldn’t say a trash verse or you was trash. Our whole career was that competition. I definitely believe people got scared to put us on their records.
But let’s even take albums out the mix. With mixtapes, you wanted to be in that No. 1 slot. So if you know anything about the Lox in the mixtape era, we was always the No. 1 slot. I remember going to DJ Clue sessions and seeing different artists there and going, oh, we’re gonna absolutely make the illest record. This gotta be No. 1 when the tape come on. I remember doing the Stretch Armstrong freestyle going, oh no, we gotta burn this. This is Stretch. This is getting heard.
And then after that period, everybody’s all super friendly. Internet fame and Instagram and Twitter and all of this to where it’s a lot of fluff. Celebrities like being with other celebrities, but they wasn’t trying to burn nobody on the mic. I can’t say the whole era is guilty — Cole is gonna try to burn you, Kendrick’s gonna try to burn you. But that don’t stand for the whole. They just rather stand with each other, take a picture and be dope, get in the studio, make a catchy song but not really try to burn each other. So I feel fortunate we came from the most competitive time period in hip-hop that may ever exist.
I’m from the Lox. When you’re in a group, that natural sense of competitiveness comes out. You want the best for the group, but nobody ever wants to be second fiddle. You don’t wanna get ate. Never. I never make a verse and go, I want to have the least favorite verse. Never. I always want the best verse. If it doesn’t happen, I’m cool and I’m comfortable and it is what it is. It’s like ballplayers getting on the court. Yeah, you on your team and you want the team to win, but who goes, “I want him to win M.V.P.”? Nobody.
SLUG
When I first became aware of “Rapper’s Delight,” it was my dad’s music. It was him playing it in his car, right next to Earth, Wind & Fire. I remember it reminding me a little bit of “Sesame Street.” It wasn’t until Run-DMC happened that I was like, this is not my dad’s music. I think he was not into it, maybe? And that made me go, oh, you don’t like that? I love it.
Melle Mel, I love him to death. He’s probably my first favorite rapper. But he was an old man to me. Run-DMC, even though they were older than me, it didn’t have that feeling. These are teenagers yelling at me. Run-DMC made me start buying records. They pushed me to become a full-time 11-year-old advocate in South Minneapolis.
By ’88, the golden year when all the great records came out, I had a crate of records, really good ones. I knew how to mix, so I was able to make blend tapes for people at school. Also in ’88, I started rapping in talent shows, but not because I wanted to be a rapper. It was just more eyes on me. I would’ve been a breakdancer. I would’ve been a backup dancer for you.
There was an older rapper, Spawn, who wanted me to be his DJ. At one point, he was like, Hey, you still rap? Why don’t you do a song with me instead of just being the DJ? The first song that I rapped on with him was very Das EFX-like. He did the production, very Beatnuts-influenced. And I’m rapping iggity piggity diggitys. I had not found my voice yet. I was still in that abyss of I can do iggitys, I can do a high voice like Sadat X, I know how to write straightforward like Ice Cube. I could do my version of all these people that I loved. It’s so far removed from what I eventually became known for.
Me and Spawn would show up at battles. I was a little younger. I was a little feistier. People saw me as a target back then. I didn’t care if I won, which is the most dangerous kind of battle because I will say some [expletive] that was super mean or harsh or degrading, and didn’t even care if it rhymed. So I was also creating adversaries, and that played as much of a role as reinforcing to me that I’m supposed to do this as any validation from the audience.
I worked retail at the time. And so I was as tapped in as anybody in the city could be. I was looking at Rawkus, they had some money behind it that they didn’t ever talk about. Seeing L.A. and what was happening with Freestyle Fellowship and that scene there, all amazing artists, knowing they get a lot of attention. They’re critical darlings.
I looked at all this like, y’all don’t know what real independence is. We’re here in Minneapolis where nobody’s checking for it. The only thing more independent than us is a rapper in Des Moines. Like, I would sleep on your couch in Dallas in order to show up the next day and rap for 20 minutes in the clothes that I slept in the night before. I really didn’t give a [expletive].
It gave me a freedom of nobody’s really listening, so I can take risks maybe that I wouldn’t be able to take if I was signed to Tommy Boy. I’m glad I said Tommy Boy, because that brings me to De La, who were a huge influence on the type of risks that I wanted to take.
I feel like I always kind of gravitated towards the people who were like, how do I either intentionally stand out or how do I express myself how I want to and still sound good?
Early on, when a rap crew would drop an album and all my friends would be like, oh my God, Grand Puba is so good, I would be like, what? No, Sadat X is the one. Kool Keith was the one in Ultramag. Everybody else was kinda like, oh, Ced Gee, he’s really rapping. What is Kool Keith talking about? I don’t care what he’s talking about — listen to him. Zev Love X, the style that he wrote with. De La, the style that they wrote with, specifically Posdnuos, but also Trugoy. I love A Tribe Called Quest. What I liked about Q-Tip’s style was that he would just figure out a way to say it that nobody’s ever said it like that before.
The emotional storytelling I ended up doing had less to do with an audience and more to do with what kind of life experience I was trying to have. I was heavily under the influence of the romanticism of people like Charles Bukowski. The drinkers and the tragedies. I wasn’t much for parties, but I liked caves. I liked dark spaces with a couple of people getting wasted, talking until the sun comes up, and then waking up the next day and not remembering what we did. I was fueled by waking up and not knowing where I was. It was a blurry couple of years, but it was very impactful because it was at the same time that my career was starting to do things.
People were validating the [expletive] that I was writing, and they were saying things to me not about my rapping, not about the songs, but about the actual words. All of this is feeding into my ego, and so I leaned into it because of how good it felt. And because, you know, let’s keep it simple, whatever traumas I had as a child needed to be dealt with. This was my self-medication for it. I didn’t know yet that the easiest colors to paint with are the darker colors.
It would’ve been this way if I had been a plumber, though. I would’ve been a messy plumber.
STIC
My older brother, who is eight years my senior, had brought some records home, and it was something that I had never heard. We were in Shadeville, dirt road Florida. We weren’t in the Bronx. He tells me, “This is called hip-hop. There’s a DJ and there’s a rapper, an MC.” He was like, “We’re going to do hip-hop.” I was maybe 8, 9. It was this group called Whistle, “Just Buggin’.” OK. Boom. And then my job was to start studying.
I would write LL Cool J’s rhymes, I would write KRS-One’s rhymes, I would write Big Daddy Kane’s rhymes on notebook paper. I didn’t have none of these terms for the technical things at that time, but I did it based on the breathing. “OK, this is where he’s taking a breath.” So I’d start another line.
I also listened to other music besides just New York. Too Short was a huge influence on me. I used to try to remember all them 80,000-bar verses he had.
I got kicked out of high school for rapping, actually, at a Black History Month assembly. They said it incited a riot.
I was known as the little rapping dude, and my teacher in ninth grade, Ms. Green, was the only Black lady I had seen in the school system with a natural ’fro. She stopped me in the hallway one day and she goes, “Do you know that in all the history of this school, in this racist institution, y’all ain’t never even had a Black history assembly?”
She was like, “I’m going to give you an opportunity: You can take your talent and do something with it. If you write a rap for Black history, I’mma let you perform at the first Black history assembly this school has ever seen.” And I was like, “Uhhh, I get to rock? Bet.”
She took me to the library — I remember because I skipped lunch — and she pulled out these three books. The first page I open up, I see Huey P. Newton. And I’m like, “Who is this?” Because it look like my cousin Carlo, right?
I ended up writing a song titled “Black As I Can Get.” What they seemed to have a big problem with was, “I ain’t no Uncle Tom/To hell with Uncle Sam.” When I said that, they cut the mic off, turned the lights on and everything. Next thing you know it was a melee.
PHONTE
The most vivid memory of hip-hop that I have is my uncle Brod, he took me to the Fresh Fest when it came to the Greensboro Coliseum. This had to be like ’85, ’86. It was Run-DMC, the Fat Boys and Whodini, and yeah, I think my fate was sealed after seeing that. My uncle bought me a Fat Boys T-shirt. I remember Run going back and forth across the stage, just the stage presence. Whodini — God, rest in peace, Ecstasy. He came out, he had the hat on, “Freaks Come Out At Night,” all of that. I remember just feeling that energy and being like, “Yeah, this is what I want to do.”
The biggest influence on how I rhymed was probably Big Daddy Kane. I always liked how Kane was. He was kind of every man, he could do it all. He could battle, he could talk to the ladies. He could be the mack, the cool pimp guy, whatever. He was smart. He would dance. He was the total package. And so my mic technique was definitely influenced by Kane, and that school of Kool G Rap, Rakim, that’s the cloth that I’m cut from in terms of that super precise flow. Sonic-wise, my biggest inspiration was A Tribe Called Quest. I wanted to rap like Kane, but I wanted our records to sound really lush and kind of beautiful, like a Tribe album, you know what I mean? That was kind of my M.O. and still is in a lot of ways, I think.
The hip-hop that I was raised on, a lot of it was Native Tongues. The Jungle Brothers, A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, and even Pete Rock and CL Smooth and Heavy D. There was always an element of singing of vocals in it. To me, it just felt like a natural extension of the records that I grew up listening to. I was born in ’78, so my mother, she always played R&B: Luther, Patti, Stevie. On our first album, “The Listening,” our first single, that’s me singing the hook.
If there was an album that was important to the way I worked, I would split the difference between two albums: “De La Soul Is Dead,” and “Death Certificate” by Ice Cube. I mean, “Death Certificate,” that was a movie on wax. It was no surprise to me that Ice Cube was able to transition into being a director and screenwriter, because he was making movies on his records back then. “Death Certificate,” I mean, I played the words off that album. Nowadays, I think sampling-wise, it would kind of be impossible to make. Well, impossible to legally make. And “De La Soul Is Dead” for reasons that, I mean, are kind of obvious, I can’t say enough about just how much I love that album, how much it influenced me.
When we were coming out, this was ’01, ’02, peak Soulquarians era. So this is the Roots, it’s Slum Village, it’s Common, it’s Black Star. It’s what Rawkus was doing at that time. I was very adamant on, “Listen dude, we’re not competing against other artists in North Carolina or other artists in our city. We’re competing against ‘Fantastic, Vol. 2,’ we’re competing against ‘Like Water for Chocolate.’ We’re competing against ‘Black on Both Sides.’ If we ain’t got nothing that’s coming with this level of smoke, then we just need to leave this alone, because that’s what we’re up against.”
BIG GIPP
My homeboy had to remind me last night, he said, “Gipp, do you realize that you’ve been involved in every era of music from Atlanta?” I said, “Wow.”
This lady named Jean Carne was a soul singer who moved to my neighborhood with her son Joseph — she had this song called “Closer Than Close.” The same year, a guy named Ray Murray moved into our neighborhood.
Once we got together, Ms. Carne bought her son our first studio. And I remember the first time he called us to say, “Yo, my mom bought me a studio,” because that was the same day LL Cool J dropped “Jack the Ripper.” It’s so cemented in my memory. We played that record over and over and over.
Ms. Carne started taking me around — that was my introduction to the music business. She is a cousin of Peabo Bryson. At her house, I got to meet Stevie Wonder, I got to meet New Edition — I got to meet the industry before I got into the industry. Her daughter had a birthday party and we went with the Jackson 5. Atlanta was filled with so many superstars, just because of the civil rights movement: Larry Blackmon was riding around, Curtis Mayfield was riding around, Kool & the Gang was riding around.
Ray started teaching me how to rap. The first records he gave me were the Last Poets, KRS-One, just to give me substance, you know? But I created myself through two artists: Chuck D of Public Enemy and Ice-T. I learned more from Chuck D than in school. Ice-T represented that player lifestyle — that caught a young dude real early. “Power,” I remember looking at the album cover like, “Yo! You’re my guy.”
I was working at a Red Lobster on Campbellton Road as a dishwasher, and one day I was listening to Public Enemy. This guy beside me was from New York. He said, “Hey, Gipp, you like that group?” I said, “I don’t like this group, I love this group.” He said, “Would you like to meet them?” I’m tripping because we in Red Lobster; we washing dishes. “Well, my name’s Mike. Professor Griff is my little brother. They’re coming to town and I’ll take you to meet them.”
He took me down to Fulton County Stadium, and I remember this night not for the concert, but because of the way that Chuck D came to the concert: They were headlining and Chuck D pulled up in a cab. That was something that stuck with me for the rest of my career.
N.W.A changed the whole temperature. It kind of stopped music for a minute. It really put the aggression into rap that wasn’t there before. And then came Geto Boys. When they say, “Who was the greatest in the South?” Scarface, period. As a kid, Scarface was our Ice Cube in the South.
Every day there was new music coming out. It was so exciting. Everywhere you go someone would be, like, “You heard this?” And it was such a change from being a kid in Atlanta, because Atlanta was so soul — there wasn’t nothing bigger than the Commodores, O’Jays, Gladys Knight, Curtis Mayfield.
Goodie Mob, we gave you the heart and soul of where we was from. We gave you everything that brought us up, everything we was made from, what our mothers taught us, how we were raised.
We didn’t come from the projects. I’ve always been around affluent Black people, religious Black people — that’s all I’ve ever seen. Drug dealers and gangsters had never been prevalent in the city because nothing could be bigger than the King. That’s the reason why you had Goodie Mob speaking the way we spoke. Even at a young age, we rapped like grown men. We still gave you “Dirty South,” we still took you into the projects, into the streets. We did all of that. We just did it from a place of always knowing we had something better.
It’s also because we were signed by Babyface and L.A. Reid. We were never on a rap label and all the things our counterparts were getting away with, we couldn’t get away with. I remember when Babyface was like, “A song ain’t a song until you have a hook and a bridge.” And that’s all he ever said to us.
I was very much influenced by wrestling. I got to see artists like Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes, the Road Warriors all up close. The costumes — I knew what it did to people when they saw it. That’s the reason we started doing that in the Dungeon Family. We knew that if people didn’t understand us, maybe they would remember what we looked like.
Who would’ve knew Outkast and Goodie Mob could’ve been this? I don’t think anybody has a André 3000 in their crew but us. I don’t think anybody got a CeeLo Green in their crew but us. How could you beat somebody like us? All you’ve gotta do is say, “CeeLo, do some Gnarls Barkley,” and it’s over.
Every time the South creates a new style, they find something not to like about it. But if you think about it, we have not stopped since us. When you look at Future — that’s family, from the Dungeon — Ying Yang Twins, Lil Jon, Ludacris, T.I., Jeezy, Gucci Mane. They didn’t like the Migos at first!
As long as Atlanta has a strip club culture, we will always be ahead of everybody. Somebody could take a Young Thug record right out the studio at Patchwerk, go right into Magic City Monday, get the prettiest stripper to dance to it, and it’s a hit record! It’s just something that doesn’t stop working.
UNCLE LUKE
This DJ on the radio named Jimmy G, that was the first time I ever heard rap on the radio. He would put the instrumental on and be like, “One day of victory, one day of defeat/Got to learn to take the bitter with the sweet.” When you look back on it, he was rapping, before “Rapper’s Delight.”
He would play Sugarhill Gang and T La Rock and Divine Sounds and Cold Crush Brothers and Furious Five. I was a member of a record pool, so I started getting these records. I would book the artist and have them come down on PEOPLExpress and perform at my teen discos and clubs. Mantronix, Dr. Jeckyll & Mr. Hyde. Jazzy Jay, that was his first flight ever. Run-DMC, I used to bring them down, pay them 1,200 bucks.
When I brought 2 Live Crew down — that was a California crew then — I wasn’t interested in being no record executive. Nobody did hip-hop in the South, so I decided, you know, I don’t take no for an answer, I’ll do it myself. I was interning at the record station, so when the DJ was in the back snorting cocaine, I would be in there playing the records on the radio, and at the same time playing my commercials for free.
My unique style of DJing was talking on the mic, getting the crowd hype, doing all the chants. So they were like, man, you need to come and be in the group. The first song was “Throw the D.” It was a dance that we created in the party. That was the first Miami bass song.
But to me, Original Concept “Can You Feel It?” and T La Rock “It’s Yours,” those were bass records. “It’s Yours” is the first bass record in my opinion. It had everything that a DJ from Miami wanted in a record. It was slow, but it had the booming bass that everybody played at the party.
In the beginning nobody really latched on, it was like foreign to everybody. The guys from Orlando and Jacksonville started copying what we were doing. The “Dazzey Duks” guys. This other record label out of Fort Lauderdale did songs around the same time we were doing it, that’s where MC Shy D was. And then you had Lil Jon start doing bass, the R&B version of it. And then the guys in Atlanta started doing it, Kizzy Rock and DJ Smurf.
People don’t realize there was no hip-hop in the South. Zero. No Texas, no Georgia, no Memphis, no nothing. I would go do shows in Atlanta, and they would have New York DJs on their radio. And so I tell people I created hip-hop in the South. People have a tendency of trying to put me in a box of just Miami. No, I inspired everybody. Tell me who was before us?
And I inspired people to be independent, too. You had Master P with “Ice Cream Man” and I tried to sign him up and he said, no, I want to do what you doing. And I was like, I respect that. I tried to go to Oakland and sign up Too Short, and he was selling out the trunk his car like me. He was like, no, I’m doing it on my own, and I respected it.
BIG BOI
It was like the X-Men School of Superheroes at the Dungeon, you know? All of us — Outkast, Goodie Mob, Organized Noize — the whole crew down there just sharpening up our lyrical skills, getting ready for the world.
It was me and Dre going back and forth. We’d just rap, trade our bars. That’s how we got our deal, actually. Big Gipp was playing the “Scenario,” Tribe Called Quest remix. He had the Isuzu Trooper and Rico Wade worked at a beauty supply store. Me and Dre was up there and then he played the instrumental and we just rapped for the longest time. And Rico was like, “OK, y’all going to the Dungeon.”
We didn’t know how to count bars or nothing. When we got to the Dungeon, one day we learned formatting. With the Organized Noize masters, they just taught us how to do it. Me, Dre and Cee-Lo were like 16 and 17, and everybody else was pushing 20.
Everybody was there: Cool Breeze, Backbone, Witchdoctor. Then later on you had Future. Everything was organic and it was like a school of brothers. And we all came up together. We didn’t go to school together, but we were in school together.
A group called Parental Advisory was there before us — KP the Great, Mello and Reese. They had a song called “Manifest” and it was a jam, a dark, real gritty song. It was underground. They were the first ones and we came after them.
When we did “Player’s Ball,” we got $100,000 each from our publishing deal at Christmas ’cause it went No. 1. When you come from nothing, $100,000 is like $1,000,000, you know what I mean? We were millionaires before we were 21.
And then what we did was, of course, we bought a car. But we took the rest of the money and we bought equipment, an MPC60 drum machine. A lot of people don’t know that we produced a lot of our records, from “ATLiens” on up to “Idlewild.” Songs like “Ms. Jackson,” “Bombs Over Baghdad,” “Aquemini” — we did those. From watching Organized Noize, it was like, OK, if we’re going to be MCs, how cool would it be to paint the soundscape and write the message?
I’m known for being half of the ’Kast and one whole of me. The globe knows us, whether it’s film and television or at my kids’ recitals or football games. The brand is prestigious. They had an Outkast bobblehead night at the Braves stadium. We didn’t have to perform a song, but the whole city came out to get these bobbleheads. It was beautiful, man.
ROC MARCIANO
We used to breakdance — put down our little cardboard, you know, the early days of Run-DMC blasting out the big speakers: “Peter Piper picked peppers.” I remember just being a kid walking to the park and hearing it on the bass speakers. Like, it sounds foreign, something I’d never heard before in my life.
Just looking at how they were dressed — leather gooses and Adidas and suede Pumas — you really identify with that because that’s what you saw dudes in the neighborhoods wearing. Before that, entertainers, you expect to see them in suits — a little more like costumes.
My first album that I ever had was a Christmas gift, and it was “Follow the Leader.” I remember running home from school to the closest spot we could get to — it was, like, my boy’s crib — because they said the new Rakim video was coming out. The “Let the Rhythm Hit ’Em” video, dude sitting on the Rolls-Royce, it was like a damn movie.
Rakim presented hip-hop in a way where I felt like I could participate. It wasn’t in your face with the showmanship. He was more cool and laid back. You could just tell he was rhyming with his inside voice, displaying intelligence. I felt like I could become an MC.
I wasn’t thinking about making songs. Back in the day, it was more like the cypher, battling, who got the best rhymes. At that age, you don’t even have beats to make songs.
I went to school with Busta’s younger brother. I had a reputation around the town for rhyming. So when Busta was starting to develop his own label, when he was first starting Flipmode, he had reached out.
Being around Busta, I learned how hard it is to be successful in the entertainment business. He’s literally like a cyborg. He doesn’t sleep. Like, he works every day, in the studio every single night, you know? I was, like, man, at what point do you celebrate being rich and famous? Success isn’t a destination, it’s a constant voyage.
The internet changed everything. People are sharing music and you can’t keep things suppressed like you probably could at one point. You know, it only takes one person you like to post something that they like, and then bang, you know?
The transition when it became more about the internet really benefited me, because around that time I couldn’t get a deal with a major label after my Flipmode situation. Like, OK, cool, we don’t need the middleman anymore. We could just upload our music and just let the fans decide what they rocking with.
Not only me — it’s helped a bunch of us become heroes. My guy Bronson, Ka, Westside and Griselda, Hommy, Currensy — I’d say I was instrumental in most of their startups. It’s just mutual respect. Lil B, you know what I’m saying? That’s definitely somebody I linked up with that probably people wouldn’t have expected me to be a big fan of. I like that he’s fearless.
Young Thug, too. When Thug came on the scene I was, like, Man, this dude’s a genius. This is like James Brown 3000! I don’t know what he’s saying, I just know that sounds funky .
You know, living in New York City most of my life, I’ve never heard MF Doom on the radio once. And he’s a legend. You could see the disconnect. Doom was doing this before all of us, this independent grind.
To a certain degree, I would say Long Island artists are slighted. Rakim, EPMD, De La Soul, MF Doom, myself — it’s a lot of heat coming out of Long Island, you know what I’m saying? And Prodigy is from Long Island. I feel like saying it’s unsung would be untrue. But we definitely have a steeper hill to climb than maybe if we were from Brooklyn or Queens.
ROXANNE SHANTE
Nipsey Russell was a comedian who had the ability to make words rhyme anytime, about anything. My first time being exposed to him was on “Hollywood Squares” or something, and he went on from the moment he started to the moment he left the show. I said, “Yeah, I can do that.”
I remember trying it for the entire day, from the moment I got off the bed to when I brushed my teeth, when I’m in the kitchen doing dishes, and by the end of the day, I felt like I had it down pat. I guess that was the origin of Roxanne Shanté.
I grew up in Queensbridge public housing — the largest housing project in the world — going to park jams, when neighborhood DJs would bring out their equipment and their speakers. I remember the very first time ever going to listen and hearing, “Bertha’s going to be there!” So, I’m thinking she’s this woman that brings this party. Later on, I found out that Bertha was actually a speaker.
Once you went to a park jam in Queensbridge, it was something that was in you. It’s like being young and leaving a karate movie and all of a sudden you want to kick, you want to chop, you want to try it. You felt like, I got to be able to do this.
The acoustics in the hallway in the projects have a little echo to it. For some reason the beat sounds really good when you bang on the wall in the projects, or if you bang on a stair railing, or even in the elevator. We would just rhyme, which is what I nicknamed the Nipsey Russell syndrome, because sometimes you can’t cut it off.
When hip-hop started, I was 3. I didn’t get a chance to be exposed to MCs from the Bronx. For me, everything was Queens. We didn’t travel to the Bronx like that. I think every borough has its own unique origin of hip-hop.
I came in as a battle rapper. By the time I was 15 years old, they wouldn’t allow me to even enter into MC contests anymore. “Is this the little girl with the braces? No, she can’t enter.” It actually became a source of income from my household. We would find flyers. “Oh yes, let me go get that money.” There weren’t any other women that were like me because I was willing to battle male, female, whoever came along.
That’s why my first record happened to be a battle record and an answer record to “Roxanne Roxanne” by UTFO. Everyone was playing it throughout the projects, and I love the beat because it’s one of those easy beats that you can do on the wall: boom, boom, boom-boom.
For “Roxanne’s Revenge,” I actually wasn’t trying to make a record. I was going to do laundry and hip-hop producer Marley Marl, who happened to live right above the laundromat, said, “Hey, listen, I need you to come to my house. I heard that you can rhyme. It’s not going to take you long.”
I said, “You’re right, it’s not going to take too long. So, let me go put my clothes in the laundry.” When I went up to his house, he played the instrumental of “Roxanne Roxanne,” and I just did a freestyle, you know, using my Nipsey Russell syndrome. I finished it, and I went back downstairs and did laundry. I never wanted to make records or pursue a hip-hop career. I never wanted to do any of that.
There was over 86 response records that were made just for Roxanne Shanté, and we will never have that again. One of the surefire ways in order to be heard at the time, especially during and after the Roxanne Wars, was to make a record about Roxanne Shanté, because she will answer it. She’ll battle anybody.
I was supposed to get a pair of western Sergio Valente jeans, because Marley Marl worked at the factory. Growing up in the projects, you would do anything for a pair of jeans. That seemed like a fair exchange, but I never got the Sergios. I need to say that: I got a hell of a career, but I never got the jeans.
BUSTA RHYMES
I had a couple of big homies that was real grown. I was still in my single-digit years, and they had these Five-Percent Nation brothers in my neighborhood. They were the ones circulating a lot of the tapes — Kool Moe Dee vs. Busy Bee and the Cold Crush Brothers battles. And as “Rapper’s Delight” started playing on the radio, they had an underground station called WHBI, I think 105.9, that used to come on at 2 o’clock in the morning until like 5.
The Supreme Team used to spin on there. The Awesome Two, Special K and Teddy Ted was spinning on there. And they had Zulu Nation radio on the same station, so sometimes Red Alert, Afrika Islam and Jazzy Jay. I would make these pause tapes and then go to school and front like I went to the battles with my big cousins and sell them for $5.
I was up that late because I found out about this station from the son of a Panamanian lady that used to babysit me when my mother was working nights. The Panamanian lady, who I love to this day, her son exposed me to graffiti. He would have this black book that he would draw the pieces he was going to spray-paint on subways. I would sit there and just be entertained, looking at a live-and-in-person movie. These were my first experiences witnessing hip-hop firsthand.
When they had the block parties in the neighborhood, that’s when I was able to really get to see the DJing and the dudes on the microphone. Everybody would be outside until shots blew on the block. But it never ended unless somebody got shot or police came.
My whole lyricism, my showmanship, I definitely attribute a lot of that to Grandmaster Caz, even though I love the whole Cold Crush. I emulated a lot just in terms of my charisma and wanting to be the leader of the crew. I loved the Sugarhill Gang, but when I found out later on that Caz wrote all of Big Bank Hank’s rhymes, that affected my appreciation.
There was also the component of my Jamaican upbringing. In Brooklyn there was this melting pot of every Caribbean community in existence. It wasn’t just about hip-hop. You had Haitians, Trinidadians, Guyanese, Jamaicans, Bajans, Panamanians. This was a significant influence on my showmanship, everything I was doing from the way I dressed to the energy that was in my shows, their flow patterns and the way they spit on dancehall records, the heavy bass line beats. I encompassed all of that into my imagination but in a hip-hop way.
I moved to Uniondale, Long Island, in 1983 when I was 12. We were all finding mischief way too soon according to our parents’ standards. They saw us going down these wrong paths. Coming from where we came from, you kind of looked at it like, “Damn, man. Long Island soft. I don’t want to go out there and be around all this grass and flower beds, around some white kids that don’t know hip-hop culture.” But that common denominator is what allowed the Leaders of the New School to connect. Because the hood was still in the suburbs.
We officially started the group around ’86, but I didn’t have the name Busta Rhymes yet. My name was Chill-O-Ski. The way we got with Chuck D and them was at a talent show that was happening in Hempstead. There were 20 to 30 groups in the lineup, and we waited all the way until the very end. Chuck D invited us out to Spectrum City Studios in Hempstead, along with some other groups.
There was a board that had all these different group names on it like Son of Bazerk, Funky Frank and the Street Force, Young Black Teenagers and Leaders of the New School. And we had to listen to them try to split our group up and put us in one that they felt we fit most with. We were like, “We didn’t come up here to be broken up.” And they respected that.
We told them that we wanted the name Leaders of the New School, and the white kid that actually ended up becoming a member of Young Black Teenagers, he wanted the same name. So we ended up having to do a battle. And they said y’all want the name that bad then y’all need to make a song called “____ the Old School.” We didn’t want to do that because we was never raised to disrespect anything before us. But it was really just a test to see how bad we wanted it. That “____ the Old School” will never surface online.
What was cool and interesting about that time was that being smart and being positive outweighed everything else. You didn’t have too many gangster rappers. There was a large Five-Percent Nation presence. It was Poor Righteous Teachers, it was Rakim, it was Lakim Shabazz, it was King Sun, it was Just-Ice. Zulu Nation was present. There were a lot of uplifting Black power movements that were happening. If you wasn’t smart, you were looked at as a real bozo.
We had Queen Latifah, MC Lyte, Salt-N-Pepa. We always had braggadocious [expletive]. We had “I’m Bad,” real machismo, and girls saying that they were sexy, but you wasn’t really hearing about how dudes were out here selling drugs, shooting. I’m not saying that any of that is wrong. Everything in hip-hop has its place. But I think too much of one thing in anything in life is not a good thing.
When Leaders of the New School was poppin’ and things started to get active for us, that created some internal conflict. The consumer started to gravitate towards who their favorite MC was in the group. In that transition, I was really on my grind crazy because I was the youngest in the group, but the first one to have a child.
As far as “Scenario,” I knew my life changed after that. Q-Tip was always like my big brother and one of my closest friends. It was quite obvious when that record came out I was set up to steal the show. When I came on the mic with my “dungeon dragon” [expletive], it was definitely a showstopping moment.
At that time, the grand finale dude was the one who ended the song. “Scenario,” I was last. “Flava in Ya Ear,” I was last. “A Buncha ____” on “Blue Funk,” Heavy D’s album, I was last. “Come on Down” on Big Daddy Kane’s “Prince of Darkness” album. When you stealing the show, you were last.
“Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See” was a turning point for my life, the first time people heard me spit on a song calmly. It’s safe to say it’s one of the greatest records ever made in the history of the culture. I ain’t saying that because it was me. I’m saying that because it’s the general consensus across the board to this day.
EASY AD
My location was around Vyse Avenue, 174th Street, 171st Street, 173rd Street, right over the bridge from the Bronx River. I started hearing music in the parks just before the summer of the blackout, 1977. It was more funky, it hadn’t crossed over to the hip-hop era.
DJ Hollywood is older, he was doing the club thing, Club 371. They were considered more like a disco type of DJs at that particular time. We didn’t wear the things that our predecessors wore. We wore sneakers, things that was very comfortable for us. We also had the atmosphere, the B-boy, breaking. In ’78, ’79, a lot of parties started happening, places started opening up to hip-hop. The Dixie Club on Freeman Street, Lovebug Starski started playing at the Burger King.
I started writing rhymes around ’77 when I was in the Hoe Avenue Boys & Girls Club. The Furious Three, the Furious Four, the Furious Five — they were really, really good on the mic. They were the MC group that pushed you to want to push yourself. Then it was the L Brothers with Master Rob and Kevie Kev. They were really out there too, playing the Dover and a lot of community centers.
The first group I was with was the AsSalaam Brothers. After we broke up, Donald D and myself went to try out for the Funk Machine. He made it, I didn’t. Then I joined the Cold Crush.
As hip-hop progressed and everybody got really good, we used to have meetings at the Police Athletic League with this guy named Blood. All the groups who were established at the time, it was Flash and the Furious Five, the Funky Four Plus One More, Cold Crush Brothers, AJ and Busy Bee. And the Mercedes Ladies was there as well. And we had meetings because we wanted to establish that if one group was playing in a particular borough, the other groups would play outside the five boroughs. That was something that no one talked about.
Flash, Disco Bee, they had a sound system. They used to record tapes. Then you had AJ and Busy Bee, they used to record. L Brothers had tapes. But their sound systems and their tapes were not crispy clear, because people used to stand in front of their system with a radio and record it. So one of my friends from fourth grade, his name is Elvis, he was actually the first tape master in the world of hip-hop as we know it. We let him plug directly into our system.
Once he plugged into our system, that was the end of that — Cold Crush tapes went triple platinum all over the world.
The tapes used to be distributed in this way: If you had a brother that was in the Army or Navy, in Japan or Germany, they used to mail the tape there. So our tapes got distribution all over the world. And they were clear as well, so it was like you were actually at the party.
Also back in the early days, there was this car service called OJ. You can rent an OJ for $40, put it on hold for an entire day. In the OJ they always had the hottest cassette tape. And so there was Cold Crush tapes in there.
One of our biggest tapes was when we battled the Fantastic Five for hip-hop supremacy in 1981 at Harlem World. That tape kind of changed the complexity of the culture , meaning that the rhyming style that was done by the other MCs, we changed that ’cause it was becoming kind of boring. So we brought a different kind of rhyme style to the table, along with the showmanship and stage performances.
When “Rapper’s Delight” came out, we were already past that style and that kind of flow. And they weren’t really part of the hip-hop community, so no one really took them seriously, the record wasn’t being celebrated. We actually did not wanna make records at all. We didn’t understand the value of them because we had something to us that was very valuable at that particular time — our stage show and our tapes.
Later on, Russell Simmons approached us when Run-DMC was just getting kind of hot. He said, “My brothers are getting bigheaded. I want them to battle y’all so y’all can show them exactly what it’s all about.” Later on we found out that he had gave them a cassette tape and told them that this is the group that you have to be better than. So they study our tapes and our style. So when you see Run-DMC, you see a part of us and our flow and our hard rhyming style.
In 1984 when “Sucker MCs” was the hottest record in the country, we had a show in Chicopee, Massachusetts, at a roller skating rink, Run-DMC and the Cold Crush Brothers. We did our show and we do what we do. We rocked it. But they were the hottest, they were the bigger ticket. But it was very humbling and honorable, they came into our dressing room and said, “Listen, we want to be like y’all. Y’all are the standard which we want to get to.”
LIL BABY
Jeezy and 50 Cent — I remember my older sister had both CDs. I was born in 1994. I’m young, but I was hanging outside, so I was hanging around older guys. I’d already seen how they was living, how they was moving. The older guys was glorifying them. As I’m listening and I’m learning, it kind of shaped my life to this day, honestly.
You wanted the tank top, you wanted the money, you wanted to have that street feeling, like wherever you go, you’re the man. That’s what I got from Jeezy and 50 Cent.
I remember being 10, 11, I used to go on YouTube at my grandma’s house all day. Sometimes they had the lyrics, sometimes they didn’t. The songs that didn’t, I’d write the lyrics down myself. I’d listen to the first bar, figure it out and write it down.
It was local Atlanta artists — these were teen club songs. There wasn’t young rappers all around the world like there is now. Skooly with the Rich Kidz, “hundred thousand dollars in a rubber band.” Different little crews — the MDC boys had a song called “Splash Gang”; Yung Booke, “Sack Right, We Straight” went crazy; Yung Woo, “She Everything I Need.” We had them little MP3 players that you clicked.
Boosie’s always been a favorite, too. More than anything, he was from across the tracks. We were from across the tracks. He had them real neighborhood stories.
Music’s always been my inspiration, getting in my vibe, get my head going. But I didn’t ever think it could do nothing for me. That’s why I never did it.
I got out of prison on July 1, 2016. I went to the studio that day, put the headphones on and tried something. But I didn’t really make nothing. I remember telling one of my friends, “I don’t feel it yet. I’m gonna wait until I run me a bankroll up, and then I’m gonna come back.”
From always reading the lyrics growing up, I knew you needed a verse and then a hook and another verse. I sat in the studio with Young Thug, Migos, Peewee Longway, KC Da Beatmonster. I had a couple little buddies with those little in-the-closet studios.
Most of it was from watching — I’m a visual learner. That’s why I never write nothing down. To this day, I’ve never really seen the writing process, where they’re really writing raps. The punch-in process is freestyling, but not really freestyling. One line at a time, sometimes two lines at a time, sometimes three.
That first time I posted a song on my page and it went viral, I kinda liked that feeling. I never released the song, because it wasn’t actually a whole song. Me and Marlo, “Set Up Shop,” was the first song I recorded that came out. The next full song I recorded was “Option.” People loved it, but it was kind of cheesy to me. When “My Dawg” came out, I was like, “This is the one.”
The first time I got booked was at Club Bankhead, $750. Then I booked myself on Mondays at Crucial, the littest in Atlanta. We’d come in 50 deep, buying bottles. It was a wave. They were booking me for less than it cost me to come in there. But it was just the fact that we were getting paid to come.
Then I was booked Thursday to Sunday, performing at little clubs, the chitlin circuit. Every weekend, I’ve got a concert. I’d go to these new places and the song would come on and they’d go word for word. That’s how I knew every song was a hit.
I got a song like, “This month I want seven/I’ve been going up/next month I want 10.” That was for a show, I was getting $7,000. That journey, it’s been there in my songs. I went from 7 to 10 to 50 to 60, then 150 then 200 then 250 then 400 then a million. And it ain’t going to stop until I stop.
I’m not saying it to brag, I was actually proud of it each time. Like $7,000 — I was astonished. “I get $7,000 to rap!?” I couldn’t have been more proud. You know what I had to do to make $7,000? And they’d give it to me to go in the club and have fun? Life is a dream, almost.
Gucci Mane has definitely been one of several mascots for Atlanta. He put it on his back. Me and Gucci met before I started rapping, from the streets. Thug’s like my brother, we grew up together, versus Gucci Mane, who was like an idol. Guwap was like unc.
Ralo was one who gave me a sense, too, that I could do it. Because I know he’s a street dude. Even though Young Thug was a street dude, he’s been a rapper the whole time, so I never looked at him like he was doing what I could. That was his God-given talent and gift.
I look at all the people, even to this day, that are still in the game after 20, 30 years. I take bits and pieces from everybody, but the people I study the most are people who lasted for a long time. Swizz Beatz is one of my close mentors. I enrolled in his business class at Harvard. And I also study the people who didn’t last, who went out quick. I try to see who all has been at my level and then lost it — how they lost it, what they did wrong. I study that.
I appreciate Drake more than words can explain. But when he first called me for a Drake feature, I didn’t understand music the way that I do now. I think that’s why I did so good. I wasn’t like, “Oh my God, it’s Drake.” I didn’t know the real worth of it. I didn’t know what he was about to do for me. But that’s how I was able to get on there and just be free. Now it’s even harder for me to do a Drake record, because I know what I’m up against.
I used to be on some, “I ain’t no rapper, I’m a street [expletive].” Now I’m not a rapper, I’m a businessman. Rapping is still a business. As good a rapper as I need to be, I need to be a better businessman.
Hip-hop has opened every door for me — the people I meet to the way I set a trust up for my kids, every single thing for me in my life. Getting my record clean, setting a foundation for my family, not having to look over my shoulder.
I was just in prison in 2016. Now it’s 2023 and I’m almost on the top of the world. I’m sitting in an office now and I’ve got 300 pieces of mail. I’ve been an adult and not gotten a single piece of mail. Nobody had my address, all the bills were in somebody else’s name. Now I’ve been gone a week, I come home and I’ve got 300 pieces of mail.
LIL BIBBY
DMX’s album when he had the fully red cover, with the blood everywhere — I had it on cassette. When I saw the picture, I got scared. I was a little kid. What’s the one where he was back and forth with different voices? “Damien!” I heard that and I said, “Is this the devil?”
To be honest with you, I used to be realistic with myself when I was young: “I already know I’m gonna die and go to jail, so who cares?” And then when I started doing music, it just worked really fast and it kind of changed all our lives.
We watched Chief Keef come up. I feel like the whole world watched Keef come up. We were all young, and it was crazy to see someone from our city become so big so quickly.
Once the music started picking up and people started paying attention, the spotlight was on Chicago. I feel like it made me take it seriously. It gave me some motivation — like, OK, maybe I don’t have to die, maybe I don’t have to go to jail.
Drake reached out — that happened super early. He reacted to “Kill ____” with Herb. I was probably only rapping for nine months, and then Drake started hitting me up and invited me to his show. I was a big Lil Wayne fan, Gucci Mane fan, a big Drake fan.
When you just doing you, you never really think about how big it is getting or who’s copying it. I’ll explain the Chicago drill sound that the U.K. and New York is doing: It’s this thing that we used to do in Chicago called footworking — the footworking beats was heavy percussion, like with the ticks.
This producer from Chicago named DJ L, he used to make every beat sound like a footwork beat. And I used to scream at him like, “Dude, I don’t wanna rap on all footworking beats! Can you make different beats?” And he just couldn’t. He was our in-house producer, so we just used to be stuck rapping on these footworking type of beats. And the whole world just started doing it. It’s a Chicago thing.
I never really think about it like that, but every now and then, I think, we just started this in the closet . Social media definitely helped the drill movement, but when I look back at it, the [expletive] we was doing was so crazy. We didn’t do a lot of thinking.
I think most Chicago artists didn’t reach their peak. Most of them passed away. It’s like crabs in the barrel. We Chicago people got trust issues — I always think somebody trying to get over on us. I don’t think we really understand the business that well. Then you feel vulnerable, like you don’t know enough. Atlanta or L.A. always have the older people that’s well seasoned on the business.
I always thought about the bigger picture, where I’m trying to go, you know what I’m saying? Since I started listening to Jay-Z, I was always like, what would Jay-Z do? That’s how I based my career.
NONAME
In terms of song structure, I was really inspired by Kanye West, Common, Lupe Fiasco and Mos Def — that type of rap where there can be messaging and maybe some political themes, but the song is pretty standard in terms of hooks and bridges. A lot of sung choruses, that kind of a thing. I tend to like writing hooks that are catchy. I really like catchy-sounding production with thoughtful lyricism. That’s what I tend to gravitate to.
I have this very vivid memory of my mom playing “Late Registration” in her Nissan Pathfinder when I was a kid, and just being in the back seat, listening.
And then when I wanted my songs to be a little more deconstructed, Jay Electronica and Earl Sweatshirt. “Eternal Sunshine (The Pledge),” that tape from Jay, I’ve never heard a rap album sound like that, or someone attempt to rap to a movie score. That was very eye-opening to me, in terms of what the genre could do. Same with MF Doom, “Madvillainy.” I had never heard anything like that. “Oh, rap could do this?”
At the time, I wasn’t really a hip-hop head. When I was a kid, I was probably listening to Michael Jackson and Avril Lavigne. I was listening to a lot of Bow Wow, actually. Like, a lot. Teenybopper hip-hop. “Doggy Bag,” 2001 — wow. He definitely had a moment. That was my childhood, as far as rap was concerned. It was not exciting.
A lot of the stuff that I was into was based on what I could listen to. My mom wasn’t really allowing me to listen to too much. She was like, “You can listen to this Michael Jackson and one Kanye album.” And whatever’s playing on the radio. It was that vibe. I would go to my friend’s house and they would be listening to Wayne mixtapes.
I’m just now starting to become a real music fan, where I can listen to a lot more genres and styles. Stylistically, in terms of pockets and playing around with language, my generation doesn’t really do that that much, just across the board. And that’s the type of hip-hop that I think I like the most. I’ve been going back to Slick Rick and Big Pun, Big L, stuff that’s either punchline driven or people are just hitting very crazy pockets. As far as new rappers, probably Boldy James, billy woods, Silkmoney. You know Babyface Ray? I liked his last tape.
I’m kind of late being a musician. I don’t know why I make the type of music that I make sometimes. Because it’s truly not really popular. I feel like everyone is trying to stay away from the type of stuff that I do because they want money. They want to sustain themselves. Not even trying to be self-deprecating, but I really don’t hear folks making kind of weird poetic [expletive] like this.
Although hip-hop wasn’t my entry point, being in organizing spaces — Black radical spaces where folks are thinking about leftist politics and ideologies — I was able to find rappers and hip-hop artists that actually do make that type of music. I guess it does lead back into hip-hop, which I didn’t realize. Aspects of it were in the Black radical tradition. I wish that aspect of it was a bit more to the mainstream, but it is what it is.
PAUL WALL
Seeing hip-hop on MTV or BET, that was a different type of hip-hop. It was all East Coast predominant. Even on the radio in Houston, I remember hearing West Coast music and wondering like, why? The East Coast, a lot of what they said, I didn’t know what they were talking about, ’cause, you know, the translation is a little bit different in the slang. We understood the West Coast a little bit more ’cause it was like a migration of people from the South that moved to the West Coast, and a lot of their music was funk- or blues-based, similar to how a lot of Southern music and hip-hop was blues-based.
But when we heard the Texas music, that’s when we heard people speaking our language to us. The Geto Boys and the Screwed Up Click, it was all kind of the same era for me. Rap-A-Lot was seen as the super mainstream, they represented us on a worldwide scale, where the Screwed Up Click was more of an underground thing. We took pride in both of them, but for different reasons.
I remember being like 15, this would’ve been ’97, riding in one of my friends’ car, going to school, him rifling through just different mixtapes and then putting a Screw tape on, that’s how we would listen to it.
A lot of that era was very territorial. The Screw tapes and Screwed Up Click was a Southside thing, but it was almost like blasphemy if you were on the Northside listening to the Screw tapes. I was an undercover Screw head, it only would be a few of us really listening to the Screw tapes like that. There was a few people that I went to school with that moved from the Southside to the Northside, so they would have the new Screw tapes, “Hey, this is what I got when I went to my grandma house this weekend.” If you had that Screw tape, you would be the man.
When I started working, I would be like stocking shelves, overnight type stuff, no customers in the store. So you turn on the “attention shopper” monitor, put a rubber band around it and have a radio playing a Screw tape all through the store.
Listening to Screw tapes, it’d be a particular artist freestyling that really clicked with you. I really liked Lil’ Keke, Fat Pat, Big Pokey. You’d be like, “Which is the one where Lil’ Keke is rapping on the MC Lyte beat? Let me find that one.”
They weren’t confined by the vocabulary you’re taught in the book. They created their own vocabulary. Keke specifically is a wordsmith who would just create his own words, his own slang. I mean, honestly, any slang that we know today that’s Houston-related or Texas-related, Keke’s the one who said it first about 95% of the time.
When it comes to Fat Pat, he had a swag to him with him being a big boy but also real player. A lot of the music he made was about girls liking him, so it was that whole player swag. That’s who you would idolize or look to be. Fat Pat’s the first person I ever heard talk about having diamonds in his teeth.
Big Pokey was laid back, he had a softer tone to his voice, but it also was like very deep and aggressive at the same time. So him being nicknamed the hardest pit in the litter, it really fit him because it was almost like a growl of a dog when you heard him rap.
My favorite Screw tapes, there’s a few of them. “Leanin’ on a Switch” is probably my favorite one. “Who’s Next Wit Plex” is another. Still to this day, when I’m riding around, I’ll put ’em on.
When the Swishahouse came about and started to be a Northside thing, then it was like, oh we can do it too. Of the Swishahouse tapes, a lot of my favorites are the Slim Thug freestyles. “Northside 9,” “Northside 10,” where I remember Slim Thug and J-Dawg just going off. Also in the Swishahouse, they would do this thing where it would be four or five people and they would say one or two lines and then it’d go to the next person, like a pass the mic kind of thing, but you wouldn’t spit a whole verse. Unfortunately, I never got to be a part of that. But those are some of the most iconic Swishahouse freestyles.
I made regular-speed music and it being slowed down was something you would dream of — making a song and it got to be so popular or big that a DJ, whether it be DJ Screw, Michael Watts, DJ Bone, any of these other DJs would slow it down and you’d hear it on a mixtape.
Michael Watts opening the door, allowing me to rap with the Swishahouse, was something where I was able to showcase my talent in a different way. I did two freestyles for Watts, and one of the ones we did was a intro for his radio show. And I remember hearing that on the radio like, man, we on the radio with a freestyle! Like, that’s crazy. So many people are trying to make it that traditional path that you gonna be waiting forever. But if you go one of these other ways and do something different, then you’ll be first in line.
RZA
Summer of 1976: A young kid who had just come back from North Carolina into the streets of Staten Island. There was a block party being thrown by a local DJ, I think DJ Quincy. The DJ had jacked power from the street lamps, plugged up his system and was playing music. And even though I was a kid that shouldn’t have been there — it was past bedtime — I was there. The music, the turntablism of him spinning the record back and forth, the guy on the mic reciting lyrics, DJ Punch. Immediately, I fell in love. I had to be 7 years old.
I remember the lyric the guy said: “Dip, dip, dive/so socialized/you clean out your ears and you open your eyes.” When you just look at those words right there, it really makes a lot of sense.
It was a life-changing year for me. I stayed in New York that summer, and then we went back down South. I had to come back to New York in 1977 and was stuck here ever since.
My cousin, the GZA, who lived on Staten Island at that time, had cousins in Queens and in the Bronx. Soundview Projects in the Bronx was one of the founding projects of hip-hop. Being a few years older than me, GZA would take me up to the Bronx and that’s where I would hear MCs. We could say our style is traced back to the Bronx because it was Soundview Projects that really put the most inspiration on us. And of course, Jamaica, Queens.
At 11, you was almost an adult, especially in poverty situations. I’m talking about going from Park Hill, Staten Island, to the Wilson stop in Bushwick on the L train, and I did that every morning. That was just New York life.
GZA was already an MC. I would just recite whatever he said, copy it. At the age of 9, I wrote my own first lyric. I would sit in school and just write lyrics all day. That was the kind of brain I had.
Before the Sugarhill Gang had a record on the radio, all we had was tapes. Cold Crush versus the Fantastic Freaks, Cold Crush versus the Force MCs, Busy Bee versus Kool Moe Dee. Those tapes, those Harlem World tapes, those uptown Bronx tapes circulating through the neighborhoods, those were our teachers.
But when I heard them on the radio, I was convinced that one day my voice was going to be on the radio. Me, O.D.B. and the GZA, we just pursued it. We would travel throughout New York, any opportunity that we could to show that we had talent.
We had bad contracts. The first contract, I’m glad I didn’t sign it. GZA and Ol’ Dirty signed it — we was probably 15, 16 years old, and it didn’t work. My first contract of course was with Tommy Boy at 19 years old, and that didn’t work either. I felt abandoned by the label. I felt that the best way to do it was to do it ourselves.
I formed my own company first, Wu-Tang Productions, and started selling records out of the trunk. Then when Loud got wind of us and offered us a deal, I went, “Nah. I can’t tie every member of this crew down to one location. This crew is big and we have to spread our wings. We have to take our talent and spread it through the industry.” I felt it was going to be impossible for all this energy to come out of one faucet. “Nah, I need more spigots.”
I thought that hip-hop was losing its roots.
And I knew that me, the GZA, Ol’ Dirty, Method Man, Ghost, we were purists. My plan was to infiltrate the industry. The purity of the culture was taking a left turn already in the ’90s, and I felt that we should enter the arena but spread it out like 36 chambers. We want our chambers to be everywhere.
You think about before us in the ’60s and ’70s, you got Elijah Muhammad making different temples around the country. Or Marcus Garvey giving us the idea that we as Black men and women have to stand up and be noble and plant our flags, calculate our lives. Those things were in the back of my head as an entrepreneur and as an artist.
Prior to us entering the industry, we always felt that Eric B. & Rakim, KRS-One, Run-DMC, Big Daddy Kane, LL Cool J — there was a moment in hip-hop, between like 1985 and 1988, that was just powerful, influential and pure still. And then ’89, ’90, ’91, it started getting diluted.
So then when we came in, we felt we was bringing it back pure, and our contemporaries, as well: Biggie Smalls, Nas, Mobb Deep, Busta Rhymes, Outkast. Our early shows, it was Outkast and Wu-Tang, popping up in Chicago. Ice Cube was probably the headliner, and we were the opening act. And a few of the underground peers who didn’t fully hit the chart surface: Brand Nubian, of course, De La Soul, Duck Down.
Hip-hop is a sport. Now Wu-Tang, of course, being nine MCs and egotistic, even though those were our peers, we felt we were the best. We felt nobody could beat Wu-Tang. That’s the Wu-Tang spirit.
When we hit No. 1 on the charts in the summer of ’97, beating the country artists and rock artists, it was like, “Wow, we did it.” And the cool thing about it was like it was without being pop. It wasn’t like we had a Top 40 record. It was just the culture itself, the path we walked.
TRINA
My beginning is watching Queen Latifah, MC Lyte, Salt-N-Pepa. I just loved them. They were different because they were from up north and wore the baggy clothes. They were just girls and they was so fire. I saw them on TV and I was obsessed.
I remember begging my mom to take me to Salt-N-Pepa’s concert in Miami. I had to be 14, 15. I had my asymmetrical haircut, my little colorful jacket on and my long onesie thing. I was dressed just like them. I thought I was one of the girls.
In concert, it was really overwhelming because they were really, really good. They were dancing and singing and rapping and performing and the DJ, Spinderella, was there. I thought, wow, this is just amazing. And it’s just all girls.
I first did the record with Trick Daddy as a favor. I didn’t know it was going to be a song. I just thought it was an intro of me talking slick to him, going back and forth, arguing with friends. But when I got there, and he played it, I was like, “What do I say to this?” I was so nervous.
But I had my friends with me and they’re real feisty. They was just like, boosting me up: “Oh, no, we got to get him out of here. We got this.” We was all in the booth and they was like, “You gotta kill him on the track. You gotta go nastier.” I was writing stuff down, scratching it off, balling the paper up. And they were like, “No, nastier. We gotta go harder.”
We called Trick, and when he came back and heard the song, he went nuts. He called the owner of the label, and I knew him from growing up. He was like, “That’s Trina who?” Trick was like, “Trina — the only Trina.” “No, it’s not.” “Yes, it is!” And when he came to the studio, he was like, “Oh, no, we signing you to a record deal.” I just left and they were stalking me for weeks and weeks.
They came to my mom’s house looking for me. I’m not interested. I’m going to be a Realtor. I just got my license. There’s no way. I went to Trick’s birthday party, and they tricked me. He wanted to perform the song and I was too shy. I got on the stage and when the song came on, I didn’t say nothing. My eyes was closed. I didn’t say not one word, but every girl in the whole entire club said the song.
The next week, he had a birthday party in Tallahassee. I came out and killed it. I was scared, but I was ready to perform after that.
Once I did the “Nann” record, immediately, I got signed to Atlantic Records. Boom, right after that, I got called to do a Ludacris record, the remix to “What’s Your Fantasy?” So now it’s these two records blowing up at the same time.
I was in the studio a lot with Trick. We had Money Mark and C.O., Tre+6, Duece Poppi. There was Plies and there was Rick Ross. I kind of followed Ross. I would not turn in no records if he didn’t approve. That gave me security of how to put the records together.
Later on, I was battling with the label about certain records that I wanted to do, because I had grown from the records like “Nann,” and they wanted those particular records. I wanted to do these records talking about how I really felt. They felt like that stuff’s soft and your fans are not soft. I had to stand firm in the paint, do what I felt and make them believe that I can make music that I believed in.
“Nann” was fun. That was dope. That was Trick’s idea. I came in, I did my thing. But now here is Trina, and Trina is a woman and she is not 19 anymore. She’s growing, and she’s been through all different kinds of things. And it worked.
Here we are 23 years later. There’s so many girls, you can’t even keep count now. What I love about that, is there was a time there was no girls. It was just four or five of us. Now there’s so much more versatility — there’s the City Girls, there’s Flo Milli, Lady London, KaMillion, Coi Leray, GloRilla, Doechii. It just feels like Ladies Night right now.
VANILLA ICE
I’m the first global hip-hop artist in the world. I don’t care who you put before me or after me, I’m the first. I put rap music in front of people’s ears who never considered or even heard of it. I hit Saudi Arabia, bro. I’ve played Iran. I’ve played in front of the Taliban and Hezbollah, and they’d sing “Ice Ice Baby.” They don’t hold the American thing against you. They look at you like, “This is Vanilla Ice.” And they treat you like royalty.
You have to understand that I grew up with poetry. When I was in the seventh grade trying to get the chicks, instead of writing love notes to these little girls, I was writing love poems. And it worked really well. I had no idea that that poetry was going to lead to my career. But the passion never left. It just kept escalating.
My mom was really good at it, too. She had these one-liners. I’m a big one-liner guy: “Drop that zero, get with the hero.” “If there’s a problem, yo, I’ll solve it.” I could run for president, bro. “Let’s make America the ’90s again.”
I got involved in “Beat Street” and “Electric Boogaloo,” the “Breakin’” movies. I was a breakdancer. I would make 40 bucks a day at the mall, spinning on my head with some cardboard and a giant jambox. Chase the girls around, eat some pizza, have some change left over.
I went to high school in Dallas, and I would spend all my summers in Miami. The whole Miami booty shake thing that everybody remembers from the late ’80s really didn’t exist yet. There was no models, Kardashians, Versaces, not even 2 Live Crew. Nobody here in Miami influenced me whatsoever.
Hip-hop was way bigger in Dallas than it was Miami in the ’80s. I thought all white people were listening to the same music across the country, and nobody was. I was the only one. I had an older brother — he was listening to Aerosmith, Foghat, Mötley Crüe. I hated that. It didn’t make me want to breakdance. Rap just fit me better than O.J.’s glove. It really did. Scott La Rock, KRS-One, Mantronix.
I grew up with D.O.C. — Fila Fresh Crew was his first rap act that nobody even knows about, and that was in Dallas. He had a big hit back in the day, “Whirlwind Pyramid.” Everybody knows he wrote all the lyrics for everybody on “The Chronic.” KNON Radio, a pirate station, that was big. Dr. Rock, Big Al. Just straight from their attic. It was so freakin’ hip-hop and so culturized.
We had a place called City Lights, where I went with my brother’s fake ID. I entered into the talent contest because I’m a battle rapper, I freestyle. I feel like I’m the best. I don’t give a damn who you are — Eminem, Ice Cube, Ice-T.
We would also go to a place called Handy Dan’s, in the back of a hardware store where we would have keg parties. You could park behind it and the cops couldn’t find you. We would have these rap battles against other schools. I had to show up and blow up, you know?
Back then we didn’t have any kind of FruityLoops or Pro Tools or computers at all. There wasn’t even a smartphone. It cost money to go into a studio. I have a lot of self-discipline, and a lot of competitive drive from motocross, because I’ve been racing since I was 8. I went out and made my money on the motocross track, 1,500 bucks a week. I found a guy in Houston who made ecstasy pills for $2 apiece in his bathtub, which was legal back then, by the way, and I sold them for 20 bucks. Instead of blowing it on my car, now I’m blowing it on the studio, hoping this works out.
I blew it up, man. I went on the Stop the Violence tour with Ice-T, Stetsasonic, EPMD, Sir Mix-a-Lot. They were rap gods at the time. I was the opening act for the opening act for the opening act for the opening act for the opener. I was there so frickin’ early, the other acts were still in their hotel.
I had a 10-minute set, me and my breakdancing crew. I had a few songs — “Ice Ice Baby,” “Play That Funky Music,” a song that was never released called “My Car Goes Boom.” I never got so much love in my whole life. I guess word gets out that there’s this white kid that’s just crushin’ it out there, so people start coming earlier to the shows. It got so much attention it went to the headliner act, Ice-T. I saw him sitting there on a road case watching me. He was the first one to tell the other acts, “You’ve got to come see this white boy. He’s dancing his ass off.” And the next night there was Chuck D sitting on the road case with Ice-T.
Chuck D actually discovered me. My first record deal had come from Ichiban Records out of Atlanta. I was on there with Curtis Mayfield. The album was called “Hooked,” which is the same songs as “To the Extreme,” just remixed. Then Chuck D called Def Jam. We had it all lined up. I was on my way to New York, ready to sign, all dreams about to come true. And I get a phone call from my manager, and he says, “Don’t sign with Def Jam.”
He came in and he explained to me this guy named Charles Koppelman from EMI Records wants to meet me. It’s the craziest thing that could happen to any musician. I did “Ice Ice Baby” and then three years go by with the blink of an eye. It took on a life of its own.
You can’t pick your audience; they pick you, bro. And I got picked. Whether you like it or you hate it, you’re not going to stop it. They used me as a product on the shelf. All kinds of funny, laughable things like “In Living Color,” “Saturday Night Live,” “Arsenio Hall Show.” It was just a big wave of entertainment. And if you didn’t recognize it or use it, then your ratings were low. Vanilla Ice was the ratings, and that was it. The most controversial artist on the planet.
The adversity that I’ve had to face is probably more than any rapper in the history of the world. I’ve always been offended by anybody calling me a “white rapper.” You’re racist if you say that. Music shouldn’t have a color. Do you call Jimi Hendrix the Black rocker? My song was No. 1 before anybody knew what color I was. I was influenced by hip-hop. You can’t name any genre or any kind of person or ethnic background that is not influenced by it.
Don’t forget, a lot of these big rappers today were influenced by Vanilla Ice, OK? Nipsey Hussle admits it. You’ve got Kobe Bryant out there winning a talent contest when he was in high school dancing to “Ice Ice Baby,” doing the exact dance moves I did. The influence and the impact is undeniable. It’s possibly the biggest impact to ever hit music in music’s history next to Elvis or the Beatles.
VIOLENT J
In the seventh grade, I met John Utsler, Shaggy’s older brother, and an original member of I.C.P. He showed me “Roxanne, Roxanne,” and all the battling they were doing. He put me up on Eazy-E. How was a seventh grader copping these vinyl records and where was he finding them at? There was no internet. It’s almost supernatural. Maybe he was listening to the Wizard on WJLB at night or something.
We would watch “Yo! MTV Raps” when it only came on for an hour. And we would also watch Channel 62, which is a local channel, and they had a show called “The New Dance Show” and they would spin local rappers’ videos. Really cheap-made local rapper videos, but they were our heroes: Awesome Dré, A.W.O.L., Detroit’s Most Wanted, Smiley, Prince Vince and the Hip Hop Force, Merciless Ameer, Kaos & Mystro, DJ Duncan Hines.
Awesome Dré’s “You Can’t Hold Me Back” album and “Straight Outta Compton,” they just lived in our CD player. It took our love of pro wrestling away, which had been our goal. But we couldn’t deny it no more, man. We wanted to do hip-hop. As far as flow, my three main guys were Ice Cube, Awesome Dré and Esham. Now Eazy-E, I love Eazy-E’s voice, but Ice Cube on “Dope Man” is just a beast. He’s coming from the gut so hard.
Because people have called us horrorcore artists, I wanted to know about horror in hip-hop. My own personal investigation leads me to Houston, Texas, Prince Johnny C. That first Geto Boys record was all normal except for this one song called “Assassins”: “My father was a priest, cold blooded he’s dead/Hypocrite, I caught him basin’, so I shot him in the head/Poured on the holy water, ‘Bless the dead’ is what I said/Then heard the demon screaming as his body bled.” Nobody was talking like that. What I do and what Esham did comes from Prince Johnny C’s original idea.
I used to have cassette cases full of tapes of local rappers. If I’d seen anything that was actually pressed up, I had to have it. So I walk into a store and there’s this guy Esham and he’s got an album out and two EPs. He’s rapping about the scariest [expletive] I’ve ever heard. He’s rapping about the devil, 666, crucifix. It was insane. And he sounds like the devil, his voice.He became our biggest influence. The sky would turn red when we’d play his CDs.
We looked at Detroit, we saw Kid Rock riding in a tractor in his video. He had Too Short producing tracks on there. He was touring with Ice Cube. He was rapping about being from 32 Mile Road, which is way the [expletive] out. It was unique, it was different. We’re like, wow, this kid’s way out, redneck-style, and he’s rapping. And then we’re looking at Esham coming out onstage in a coffin, rapping about the devil.
So we were like, this is what Detroit does — theatrics. Plus we’re huge wrestling fans. We put face paint on after our first EP. The way Kiss does it in rock, in rap who’s doing that, you know? It felt natural. It wasn’t awkward. And we’ve been doing it ever since.
Right from the rip, we did everything ourselves. We pressed our CDs up, we advertised ourselves. And we hired Esham and Kid Rock, the two biggest rappers in Detroit, to be on our first CD. We had Michigan on lock. And Toledo and parts of Ohio. I’m talking 3,000 people at a show. We couldn’t do [expletive] in Pittsburgh if we went there, though.
I remember in ’95, Onyx and Das EFX were going on tour. We got on that tour somehow. We got booed off every night, sometimes violently. It was probably 400 people at every show that we went to. We got to Michigan, 2,200 people packed, sold out. Onyx came to us and was like … We went out last. It was three shows we did like that — Detroit, Flint and Toledo.
That was our first tour.
After ’95 we toured nonstop, but our experiences with touring with other rap groups are very minimal. For multiple reasons, but the Faygo is a main one. If they have their equipment up there, it’s gonna be all wet. Like, we’ve played with Snoop Dogg, but he’s had to go on first, which sucked, because people leave. But he ain’t gonna go on after we destroyed the stage with the Faygo.
In ’94, we got asked to be part of this big rap show in Toledo. It was Outkast, Coolio, a bunch more. We were so honored to be on a lineup like that. So we do the show and afterward the Outkast guys surround us and they’re like, you got your [expletive] soda all over our [expletive]. So we had to pay ’em money for cleaning and everything. People were mad at us and we weren’t trying to get nobody mad at us. We just wanted to do our thing.
You know, there’s a lot of reasons why we’re in this place we’re in. It’s a benefit because the Juggalos are the [expletive] and very supportive. But people look at Juggalos like they’re not people. They say, the only ones that like your [expletive] are the Juggalos. What are Juggalos? They’re people!
I would love the opportunity to get out on one of these hip-hop tours and perform for an audience that ain’t ours so people might say, man, they’re actually pretty good. One time we offered Ice Cube $100,000 to spit a verse and he passed, and then years later he did it for free, out of respect. Ain’t that crazy?

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The technology for morphing flesh-and-blood performers into virtual avatars has been improving for years. Now it has become an issue in the actors' strike.
To pack three seasons' worth of English soccer stadiums with exasperated or exhilarated crowds, the Apple TV+ comedy "Ted Lasso" turned to dozens of background actors and powerful visual effects technology.
Using a technique known as crowd tiling, the company Barnstorm VFX helped film groups of extras in one alignment before rearranging them and filming them again, and then cutting and pasting the various groupings to fill all the seats. The show's makers also used crowd sprites, in which actors were filmed individually on green screens and then arranged to appear as part of the crowd. There were even digital doubles: three-dimensional models whose movements were informed by a motion actor.
Innovations in digital technology and artificial intelligence have transformed the increasingly sophisticated world of visual effects, which can ever more convincingly draw from, replicate and morph flesh-and-blood performers into virtual avatars. Those advancements have thrust the issue toward the top of the grievances cited in the weekslong strike by the actors' union.
SAG-AFTRA, the union representing more than 150,000 television and movie actors, fears that a proposal from Hollywood studios calling for performers to consent to use of their digital replicas at "initial employment" could result in its members' voice intonations, likenesses and bodily movements being scanned and used in different contexts without extra compensation.
Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, SAG-AFTRA's chief negotiator, said it would be impossible for actors to provide informed consent without knowing how their digital replicas would be used in a cinematic universe or, in some cases, unknown future projects.
"That's really abusive," he said, "and not an OK way for companies to deal with somebody's image, likeness or persona. It's like owning a person."
In an explanation on its website, the union says its counterproposals include guarantees for "informed consent and fair compensation when a 'digital replica' is made or our performance is changed using A.I."
A spokesman for the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the organization that negotiates for the studios, disputed the union's characterization of its proposal. The alliance's position would "only permit a studio to use the digital replica of a background actor in the motion picture for which the background actor is employed," the spokesman, Scott Rowe, said in an emailed statement. "Any other use requires the background actor's consent and bargaining for the use, subject to a minimum payment."
There were 17,000 active members of the union who performed background work in the last year, and more than 80,000 who have done it at some point in their careers, according to union figures. Background actors receive a daily rate of $ 187 for an eight-hour day.
Jennifer E. Rothman, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's law school who specializes in intellectual property, said that if limits on digital replicas were not hammered out at the bargaining table, lower-profile performers might not realistically be able to say no to studio demands.
"It's the up-and-comers and the extras who won't have any leverage," she said.
Lawson Deming, a visual effects supervisor and a co-founder of Barnstorm, echoed that view. Famous actors will be able to negotiate into their contracts that they own their likenesses, he said, but a vast majority of the SAG-AFTRA membership will not be so lucky.
"It's not a question of technology," he said. "It's a question of who has the power in the relationship."
That is partly because the technology is already here.
Such scenarios can sound like science fiction, but "performances" by the past selves of aged or even deceased actors have helped carry movies like 2016's "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story." Aided by motion capture recorded on a different actor, Peter Cushing, who died in 1994, reprised his role as Grand Moff Tarkin from the original 1977 "Star Wars" film. (His estate gave permission.)
"Digital humans have been part of the visual effects process for quite a while now -- about 20 years," said Paul Franklin, a visual effects supervisor at DNEG.
Initially they were created for what Franklin called "digital stunt doubles," replicas of actors for stunts that were so death-defying or impossible that real-life stunt doubles would not do them. In one case, he helped a digital replica of the actor Henry Cavill fly as Superman in 2013's "Man of Steel."
Doing such work often involves a practice known as photogrammetry, in which many photographs of something physically real -- like an actor's head -- can be used to digitally reconstruct it in three dimensions.
Technical wizardry is also used to build crowd scenes like the ones in "Ted Lasso." For 2012's "The Dark Knight Rises," Franklin used digital techniques to fill the nearly 70,000 seats at Pittsburgh's professional football stadium with just 11,000 extras.
Bob Wiatr, a visual effects compositor, was instrumental in filling out crowd scenes for "Daisy Jones & the Six," a limited series on Amazon that had its debut this year. In one scene in which the camera, angled behind the titular rock band, looks onto the crowd, real background actors occupy the front rows, while computer-generated avatars fill up the rest.
"Sometimes there are people that are recognizable in the front," Wiatr said, referring to other projects, "and they decide they want to do it from another angle later after they've already shot the scene, so they recreate the shot, and then usually you have 3-D-generated people -- a lot of software can make it."
That does not mean, however, that the task is simple or cheap. Deming of Barnstorm cautioned that concerns over reusing actors' digital scans might be overblown.
"It is very complex to digitally take a scan of someone and make it animatable, make it look realistic, make it functional," he said, though he allowed that "we're making very big leaps."
The biggest leaps are now being made in artificial intelligence. Last month the comedian Sarah Silverman joined class-action lawsuits against the companies OpenAI and Meta, accusing them of using her copyrighted written work to train their artificial intelligence models. SAG-AFTRA is concerned about something similar happening to actors' performances.
Linsay Rousseau, a voice actor and performance capture artist, said performers were fearful of a future in which artificial intelligence reduces or eliminates roles for humans.
"We're worried," she said, "that we go in and record a session, they then take it, synthesize that voice, and don't call us back. Or they process them to create new voices and thus do not call actors in to do that work."
One visual effects company, Digital Domain, said in a statement that in the past five years it had used A.I. to "greatly accelerate" and "increase the accuracy" of digital avatars based on background actors.
"Machine learning is used to create a library of all possible facial shapes of a given actor, or the possible deformations of a piece of clothing or a set of muscles," the statement said. "This library is then used to create a lifelike digital version of what was captured. We also have the technology now where we can create performances of historical figures based on existing footage."
Franklin, a two-time Oscar winner for his visual effects work on "Inception" and "Interstellar," said it was clear that technology had advanced beyond the scope of typical industry contracts.
"I think it is a valid concern," he said. "People think, 'Well, what's going to happen to this data? How's it going to be used in the future?"'

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida introduced a 10-point economic plan geared toward the blue-collar voters with whom he has struggled to resonate.
Attempting to meld his "anti-woke" politics with economic policy, Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday unveiled a plan that he claimed took on corporate interests, business elites, federal government bureaucrats and foreign trade relations -- forces he blamed for derailing the prosperity of American families.
"We will declare our economic independence from the failed elites that have orchestrated American decline," Mr. DeSantis said during a speech at a bustling New Hampshire logistics-company warehouse, laying out the economic vision for his presidential campaign. "We the American people win; they lose."
The governor linked a decline in U.S. life expectancy to suicides, drug overdoses, alcoholism and the struggles facing the nation's working class. "This is not normal, this is not acceptable, and yet entrenched politicians in Washington refuse to change course," he said.
His populist, anti-corporatist comments seemed intended to lift his standing with non-college-educated voters, a crucial Republican constituency that polling shows is not supporting Mr. DeSantis's candidacy in large numbers. Only 13 percent of Republican voters without a college degree nationwide back Mr. DeSantis, according to the first New York Times/Siena College poll of this election cycle. Former President Donald J. Trump, the race's front-runner, has attacked Mr. DeSantis as a "globalist" and a "RINO," or Republican in name only.
Mr. DeSantis's somewhat scattershot 10-point plan also includes goals to achieve energy independence, end President Biden's climate change policies, rein in federal spending, expand vocational education and make colleges responsible for student loans. He also proposes revoking China's preferential trade status, limiting "unskilled" immigration and cutting taxes.
In sum, the plan largely repeats standard conservative promises to stoke economic growth by reducing taxes on corporations and investors, and by cutting government regulation -- proposals that are typically cheered by business lobbyists, despite Mr. DeSantis's anti-corporate, "anti-woke" rhetoric. He would prioritize fossil fuel development, another longtime conservative plank. And his proposals to further reduce America's economic links with China echo the plans of an emerging populist wing of Republican candidates, including Mr. Trump.
The governor's speech is part of an effort to recalibrate his campaign, which laid off more than a third of its staff this month, as it failed to meet fund-raising goals. National polls show him trailing Mr. Trump badly. Mr. DeSantis has already reshaped the tactics of his campaign in the past week, opening himself up to more questions from voters and the media; holding smaller, less formal events; and condensing his lengthy stump speech. Now, his advisers say he is also resetting his message, with plans to talk more about the policies he would implement as president, as well as about his biography, rather than about his record in Florida.
Mr. DeSantis has already unveiled proposals on immigration and the military. Ahead of the first Republican debate on Aug. 23, he is also expected to introduce his foreign policy plans, using that topic and his economic strategy as the cornerstones of his campaign in the coming weeks.
But Mr. DeSantis, who prides himself as a policy expert, has a tendency to delve deep into details and to use a sometimes bewildering series of acronyms in his stump speeches. His allies say that getting into kitchen-table issues like the economy is a necessary shift.
"The average voter probably needs to be talked to on a higher level, not getting down into the weeds so much," said Jason Osborne, the New Hampshire House majority leader who has endorsed Mr. DeSantis. Still, Mr. Osborne said, many party activists appreciated the governor's attention to the finer points of policy.
On Monday, Mr. DeSantis littered his speech with references to the C.C.P. (the Communist Party of China), E.S.G. (environmental, social and governance standards used by corporations), D.E.I. (diversity, equity and inclusion policies) and C.B.D.C. (a central bank digital currency).
He saved some of his harshest words for China, saying that its Communist Party was eating "this country's lunch every single day."
In addition to revoking China's "most favored nation" trading status, the governor said he would ban imports made from stolen U.S. intellectual property and would prevent companies from sharing critical technologies with China.
Mr. DeSantis also notably accused big corporations of contributing to what he called the nation's "economic malaise" by adopting political ideologies.
Those comments reflected Mr. DeSantis's embrace of the New Right, which argues that leftists have taken over many boardrooms and that conservatives must overcome their historical aversion to limited government interference in corporate matters and fight back. The governor has attacked those he calls "Chamber of Commerce Republicans," meaning those more traditional members of the party who have criticized his ongoing feud with Disney.
"There's a difference between a free-market economy, which we want, and corporatism, in which the rules are jiggered to be able to help incumbent companies," he said, adding that he would ban individual stock trading by members of Congress and executive branch officials.
In addition, Mr. DeSantis derided government bailouts, citing the financial crisis in 2008 and the stimulus signed by Mr. Trump in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
And he pledged to make institutions of higher education, instead of taxpayers, responsible for student debt, a menacing shot at universities that escalates policies he has proposed as governor to overhaul Florida's higher education system.
He also proposed a plan that borrows from traditionally liberal agendas: allowing borrowers to discharge their remaining student loan balances if they declare bankruptcy. While it is now possible for debtors to do that, many have found the process difficult and cumbersome, and liberal groups like the Center for American Progress in Washington have embraced such reforms in the past.
"It's wrong to say that a truck driver should have to pay off the debt of somebody who got a degree in gender studies," Mr. DeSantis said. "At the same time, I have sympathy for some of these students because I think they were sold a bill of goods."
On the campaign trail, Mr. DeSantis often highlights his economic acumen by pointing to Florida's surging economy, influx of new residents and the formation of new businesses. But the picture has grown less rosy this year, with inflation in Florida's biggest metro areas rising faster than the national average. A troubled property insurance market and an affordable housing crisis have also complicated his message.
In response to a question from a reporter on Monday, Mr. DeSantis defended his record on the state's economy, saying that his landslide re-election had allowed him to pass major legislation addressing the property insurance and housing issues.
"We've been working on this for a number of years," he said.
Mr. Trump's campaign has hit Mr. DeSantis repeatedly for his management of the state.
"Ron DeSantis should pack his knapsack and hitchhike his way back home to focus on the serious issues facing the great state of Florida," Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, said in a statement.

From Pause to Pay On Student Loans: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The payment pause freed up money that gave people breathing room -- or allowed them to help family members in need. They will soon have to budget for that expense.
With her student loan payments on hold for three years, Ashley Dorn, a public school music teacher, found another use for the money she saved during the moratorium. She used the extra cash to pay off $ 10,000 in credit card debt, a bill that had been nagging at her for a decade.
"I could not have done it if it wasn't for this student loan debt pause, and I'm worried that I'm just going to have to start racking it all up again," she said of the credit card debt. She can't imagine being able to afford payments unless she finds another job, she said, on top of her "already very time-consuming, already very stressful career."
She earns around $ 50,000 a year and her husband earns about $ 45,000 as a government employee, but they still live paycheck to paycheck. Since graduating in 2014 with a master's in education from State University of New York Empire State College, Ms. Dorn and her husband, Jonathan, who live near Albany, had been making monthly payments on their more than $ 160,000 in student debt. They paused in March 2020, when, as part of a pandemic relief effort, the Trump administration said borrowers with federal student loans could stop making monthly payments.
The couple's payments were nearly $ 900 a month, with Ms. Dorn on an income-driven repayment plan, which adjusts payments to a borrower's salary.
Now that the pause is ending in late August, and with President Biden's debt forgiveness proposal shot down by the Supreme Court, the Dorns and millions of others are facing the reality of resuming those loan payments.
For many of the 43.6 million borrowers with federal student debt, the three-year pause created a financial cushion that allowed them to use the money for other purposes: buying homes, paying off credit card debt, supporting family members, undergoing overdue medical procedures and booking vacations. Now they are figuring out how to cut back to fit those payments into their budgets.
The Dorns had always assumed they would have children someday, but the burden of their student loan debt has made them reconsider. For now, their two dogs, Micah and Oscar, and two cats, Ellie and William, will have to suffice.
"That conversation is, like, off the table indefinitely," Ms. Dorn, 33, said. In addition to monthly expenses like their mortgage and car payments, Mr. Dorn has Crohn's disease, which adds an extra layer of financial stress.
The couple said they expected their new monthly payments, which will be calculated by their income-driven repayment plans, to be around $ 800. That may change with the Department of Education's new I.D.R. option, the Saving on a Valuable Education plan, or SAVE, which factors in income and family size.
Before the payment pause, Ms. Dorn had been relying on her credit card to cover expenses like an unexpected emergency-room visit, veterinary bills, health care co-payments and new car tires. She used credit to replace their water heater, cover a few car insurance payments, and install a new transmission in her husband's car. Within the last six months, she paid off her credit balance and closed the card using a debt-solution program.
For Shantel Anderson, 27, the pause was a lifeline that allowed her to support her mother and help her avoid eviction. The two struggled when Ms. Anderson was growing up in Philadelphia, bouncing from apartment to apartment until they were evicted; they ended up at a homeless shelter for a week just before she started college. Her mother had lost her job earlier that year, and Ms. Anderson, then 18, had deferred her first fall semester of college because she couldn't afford to go. Having lost most of her possessions during the eviction, Ms. Anderson relied on donations from people in her life, including her school guidance counselor, for dorm supplies.
Ms. Anderson secured financial aid and student loans to study political science at Eastern University while maintaining a work-study job and other employment, but still graduated in 2018 with $ 43,000 in debt. The moratorium, which freed up $ 455 a month, allowed her to cover her mother's phone bill and some car repairs. Ms. Anderson also helped her mother with groceries, medication, gas and cat food. With these costs handled, her mother could put all of her income toward paying rent and utilities.
Ms. Anderson's first full-time job out of school, at a veterinary hospital, paid $ 32,000 annually, and the hospital provided housing at the time. When the pandemic recession hit, her hours were cut. She made one last full student loan payment in March 2020, then a few more $ 50 monthly payments. But when she found out she would be losing her housing, she stopped making the debt payments to afford rent and other bills.
The pause allowed her to move into a three-bedroom high-rise apartment with a pool and a gym -- amenities she thought she'd never be able to afford -- paying $ 500 for her share of monthly rent with three roommates. She bought a car, which made running errands easier, and was able to cover about $ 400 in co-payments for unexpected health issues and medical procedures.
Some borrowers were shocked last August when Mr. Biden's debt relief plan was announced.
"That day was crazy to me," Ms. Anderson said. She believed the plan would have cut her federal student debt in half. Her relief soon gave way to skepticism after Republican lawmakers filed a series of lawsuits to block the plan.
When payments resume, Ms. Anderson expects that her monthly bill will remain around $ 455, which she will add to her $ 250 monthly car and credit-card payments. She has increased her income to more than $ 60,000 a year working as a data manager at a nonprofit, and signed up for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (P.S.L.F.) last October -- but she has already started cutting back on certain expenses.
She stopped going to therapy to save on out-of-pocket co-payments and talked to her mother about not being able to help her out as much. In an emergency, Ms. Anderson said, she would sell her car.
She still helps with some of her mother's expenses: the phone bill, gas money to commute to her part-time job at a nursing home and, occasionally, groceries. But her mother has already fallen behind on rent, and her landlord filed eviction paperwork.
"She had a court date," Ms. Anderson said. "Her landlord didn't show up, so the judge threw out her case. I was like, thank the lord, we have more time."
Lifestyle gains
For others, the pause helped redirect money to items like home renovations and vacations. Elizabeth Burton and her husband, Kyle, carry private and federal student loan debt of about $ 175,000. The moratorium saved the couple, who live in Manchester, N.H., around $ 650 each month. Her schedule as a sonographer allowed her to stay home during the day, saving them an additional $ 1,200 in child-care costs during the pandemic, keeping their 8-year-old and 5-year-old at home.
While Ms. Burton, 39, and her husband, 38, a sales representative, still had to pay $ 500 each month toward private loans, the extra funds allowed them to put a second bathroom in their house, pay off credit card debt and book an eight-day family vacation to Disney World.
Now that Ms. Burton and her husband have higher paying jobs, they believe an income-driven repayment plan would lead to a higher bill than before.
"There's no money for my kids for college," Ms. Burton said. "I'm still going to be paying down my loans. But you know, my son's 8. I have 10 years left in my federal loans. There's no money for him. He'll either have to take out loans, he'll have to live at home, he'll have to get a scholarship -- I've got nothing left for him."
The Dorns used some of their saved student debt money to book a vacation, too -- for July 2025. They plan to celebrate their anniversary in Jamaica, hoping to soak up the tropical atmosphere and explore the marine wildlife. The couple is on a payment plan for the trip, which offers the option to spread small payments over three years. It's their dream vacation, Ms. Dorn said. But with the payment pause ending, they are considering giving that up, too.

Student Loans Come Due Again: Many Borrowers Will Lose a Lifeline

With DeSantis Reeling, What About Scott?: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Last Sunday, I argued that despite his stagnation in the polls, for Republicans (and non-Republicans) who would prefer that Donald Trump not be renominated for the presidency, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida remains pretty much the only possible alternative.
Naturally the week that followed was the worst yet for DeSantis, beginning with a campaign staff purge that featured a Nazi-symbol subplot and ending with the candidate doing damage control for his suggestion that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. might run his Food and Drug Administration.
The worst news for DeSantis, though, was new polls out of Iowa showing Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina creeping up on him, with around 10 percent support, to the governor's roughly 15 percent.
One of my arguments a week ago was that no other Republican, Scott included, had yet shown any capacity to build the support that even a stagnant DeSantis enjoys. But if the governor falls into a sustained battle for second place, he's probably finished, and Trump can probably just cruise.
Unless that battle results in a DeSantis collapse and a chance for someone else to go up against the front-runner. After all, why should DeSantis be the only non-Trump hope just because he seemed potent early on? Why not, well, Tim Scott?
Say this for Scott: He has an obvious asset that DeSantis is missing, a fundamental good cheer that Americans favor in their presidents. Say this as well: He has the profile of a potent general-election candidate, an African American and youthful-seeming generic Republican to set against Joe Biden's senescence. Say this, finally: Scott sits in the sweet spot for the Republican donor class, as a George W. Bush-style conservative untouched by the rabble-rousing and edgelord memes of Trump-era populism.
But all of these strengths are connected to primary-campaign weaknesses. To beat Trump, you eventually need around half the Republican electorate to vote for you (depending on the wrinkles of delegate allocation). And there's no indication that half of Republican primary voters want to return to pre-2016 conservatism, that they would favor a generic-Republican alternative to Trump's crush-your-enemies style or that they especially value winsomeness and optimism, as opposed to a style suited to a pessimistic mood.
The reason that DeSantis seemed like the best hope against Trump was a record and persona that seemed to meet Republican voters where they are. His success was built after Trump's election, on issues that mattered to current G.O.P. voters, not those of 30 years ago. He could claim to be better at the pugilistic style than Trump -- with more to show for his battles substantively and more political success as well. On certain issues, Covid policy especially, he could claim to represent the views of Trump's supporters better than Trump himself. And with DeSantis's war on Disney, nobody would confuse him for a creature of the donor class.
All this set up a plausible strategy for pulling some Trump voters to DeSantis's side by casting himself as the fulfiller of Trump's promise -- more competent, more politically able, bolder, younger and better suited to the times.
This strategy was working five months ago, and now it's failing. But its failure doesn't reveal an alternative pitch, and certainly Scott doesn't appear to have one. Indeed, as The Bulwark's Jonathan Last points out, Scott isn't really casting himself as a Trump alternative; he's mostly been "positioning himself as an attractive running mate for Trump, should the Almighty not intervene" and remove the former president from the race.
So for him to surpass DeSantis and become Trump's main adversary could be what Last describes as a "catastrophic success." It might lead to a weird sacrificial-lamb campaign, in which Scott contents himself with the quarter of the primary electorate that currently supports him in head-to-head polling against Trump. Or it could push him to come up with a pitch to be Trump's successor. But it's hard to see what would make that pitch stronger than the one that isn't currently working for DeSantis.
After all, the governor has a substantial record of policy victories; Scott has rather fewer. DeSantis has been successful in a contested political environment; Scott is a safe-seat senator. DeSantis was arguably as important a Republican as Trump during the crucial months of the Covid era; Scott was insignificant. DeSantis has struggled to expand his policy pitch beyond Covid and anti-wokeness; Scott doesn't even have that kind of base to build on.
For DeSantis to defeat Trump would make sense in light of the G.O.P. landscape as we know it. For Scott to win would require a total re-evaluation of what we think we know about Republicans today.
Such re-evaluations happen, or else Trump himself wouldn't have been president. Success creates unexpected conditions; if Scott surpasses DeSantis, he will have the chance to make the most of them.
But for now, his climb in the polls looks like a modest victory for his own campaign and a bigger one for Trump's.

Full text: As Val, one of the dancers in the hit Broadway musical, she sang a memorable song explaining how she got work by enhancing her body through cosmetic surgery.
Pamela Blair, who as the sassy and profane dancer Val in the original production of "A Chorus Line" delivered a showstopping song about enhancing her breasts and butt with silicone to get work as an actress, died on Sunday at her home in Mesa, Ariz. She was 73.
Her former husband, the director Don Scardino, said the cause was complications of colon surgery, including pneumonia and sepsis. She also had Clippers disease, a chronic inflammation of the central nervous system.
Ms. Blair was one of the performers who were invited to the workshops where "A Chorus Line" was developed, and who told the creative team -- led by Michael Bennett, who conceived, directed and choreographed the show -- deeply personal stories, which were used as material to build its characters.
"The core of Val came from the anarchic character that was Pam," Mr. Scardino said in a phone interview.
Ms. Blair's brassy solo, "Dance: Ten; Looks: Three" (a reference to the grades Val got at an audition before undergoing cosmetic surgery), was a paean to the benefits of silicone, among them the national tours Val was hired for. (Ms. Blair herself said she didn't have her breasts enhanced.)
In a number written, like the rest of the show's score, by Marvin Hamlisch (music) and Edward Kliban (lyrics), Val sings, in part: "It's a gas, just a dash of silicone/Shake your new maracas and you're fine."
And:
Where the cupboard once was bare
Now you knock and someone's there
You have got 'em, hey, top to bottom, hey.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In reviewing "A Chorus Line" in its pre-Broadway run at the Public Theater in the East Village, Allan Wallach of Newsday called Ms. Blair "a marvelously defiant blonde" and Douglas Watt of The Daily News of New York described her as "blonde and saucy." After moving to Broadway in 1975, the show ran for 6,137 performances. Ms. Blair stayed with it for about a year before joining the national tour.
In 1980, Ms. Blair recalled the experience of singing "Dance Ten; Looks Three."
"When I sang that song, I really was like that girl," she told The Hartford Courant. "I was blond. I was dumb. I didn't know what I was doing. But I thought, 'Damn it, I'm an actress too."'
She returned to Broadway in 1978, first in the musical "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas," in which she played a prostitute, and later that year in another musical, "King of Hearts," in which she played the youngest inmate in a mental hospital.
She made her final Broadway appearance in 1990 when she replaced Megan Gallagher as Lt. Cmdr. Joanne Galloway, the only female character in Aaron Sorkin's military drama "A Few Good Men."
"It was great at first, being the only girl with all those guys," she told The Daily News in 1990. "But it didn't last. Now they treat me like one of them. I get no respect. They go around backstage in their holey underwear -- and even less!"
Ms. Blair was also seen on soap operas like "Loving" and "Another World"; on prime-time series like "The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd" and "Sabrina the Teenage Witch"; and in films like John Huston's version of the musical "Annie" (1982) and Woody Allen's "Mighty Aphrodite" (1995).
Pamela Blair was born on Dec. 5, 1949, in Bennington, Vt. Her father, Edgar, worked at a company that made plastic molds. Her mother, Geraldine (Cummings) Blair, was a homemaker who worked part time in a local Christmas shop and as a library volunteer.
When Ms. Blair was 16, she entered the National Ballet Academy New York. She met Mr. Bennett during a class there, which led to her being cast in her first Broadway role, in the 1968 musical "Promises, Promises," which he choreographed.
In 1972 and 1973, Ms. Blair played several roles in "Sugar," a musical adaptation of the Billy Wilder comedy "Some Like It Hot" (unrelated to the current Broadway adaptation). She was the understudy for the title role, Sugar Kane, which Marilyn Monroe had played in the 1959 film, and replaced Elaine Joyce when she went on vacation.
When asked how it felt to star in "Sugar," she told the syndicated columnist Leonard Lyons: "I wasn't that nervous. The butterflies hadn't developed -- they were still caterpillars."
In 1973, she played another small role in the musical "Seesaw," for which Mr. Bennett was the director and one of two choreographers. A year later, she was cast as the seductive character known only as "Curley's wife" in John Steinbeck's stage adaptation of his novel "Of Mice and Men," which starred James Earl Jones and Kevin Conway.
"I can't tell you how affected I was by acting with James Earl Jones," she told Newsday. "To do a scene with him was so exciting. I would lose myself in him. I want that again."
She continued to work on TV and in films through 2009. By then, she had moved to Arizona and become a physical and massage therapist, although she return to the stage to play Miss Mona, who runs the Chicken Ranch brothel, in a 2006 Phoenix production of "Best Little Whorehouse."
Ms. Blair is survived by a sister, Cheryl Hard. Her marriages to Alfred Feola and Mr. Scardino ended in divorce.
In 1980, Ms. Blair recalled the tension she felt while she was in "A Chorus Line," mainly because of Mr. Bennett.
"He made you live the show," she told The Courant. "I mean, he'd make you think you were gonna be fired at any moment."
Near the end of her time in the show, she watched it from a seat in the audience.
"I thought we were all so unhappy and yet we were giving people such joy," she said. "I cried during the finale, and I remember thinking: This show was a miracle. Why couldn't I have enjoyed it while it was happening?"

A Homeless Crisis Is a Test of Portland's Identity: [National Desk]

Full text: Come to Portland, his sister said. It's green and beautiful, people are friendly and there are plenty of jobs.
In 2018, Anthony Saldana took his sister's advice. He left Las Vegas, where he was working in a casino, and moved to a Portland suburb.
He rented an apartment and got a job at Home Depot. Mr. Saldana, though, never quite found his footing. By early 2021, he was living in a tent, under a tree on the edge of a highway in Portland.
He wouldn't let his sister, Kaythryn Richardson, visit him and shared only a few details with her about his life on the streets. He told her about the "bad people" terrorizing him and about the Disney movies he had watched to drown out the chaos that was slowly pulling him under.
"Hello sister," he texted last October. "I'm hurting."
All of Portland, it seems, has been trying to figure out what has been happening to people like Mr. Saldana, and to Portland itself.
This city of 635,000, home to the world's largest bookstore and majestic views of snowcapped Mount Hood, has long grappled with homelessness. But during the pandemic this perennial problem turned into an especially desperate and sometimes deadly crisis that is dividing Portland over how to fix it.
While other cities in the West, like San Diego and Phoenix, face similar issues, the suffering on Portland's streets has dealt a singular challenge to the city's identity as a liberal bastion that prides itself on embracing transplants from across the country.
In 2022, Portland experienced a spate of homicides and other violence involving homeless victims that rattled many in the community: a 42-year-old homeless woman shot in the face by two teenagers who were hunting rats with a pellet gun; a 26-year-old homeless woman stabbed in the chest outside her tent; another homeless woman, 31, fatally shot at close range by a stranger.
The search for answers points in many directions -- to city and county officials who allowed tents on the streets because the government had little to offer in the way of housing, to Oregon voters who backed decriminalizing hard drugs and to the unrest that rocked Portland in 2020 and left raw scars.
But what has turbocharged the city's troubles in recent years is fentanyl, the deadly synthetic drug, which has transformed long standing problems into a profound test of the Portland ethos.
Outreach workers in Portland say rampant fentanyl use, has coincided with the increasing turmoil among many homeless residents.
Doctors who care for people living on the streets say fentanyl addiction is proving harder to treat than many other dependencies.
Yet, as they have for years, legions of volunteers -- professionals, recovering addicts and anarchists -- routinely hand out sandwiches, wound kits and clementines around the encampments. Those volunteers include people like Jakob Hollenbeck, 23, who last year befriended a group camped out across the street from his house in Portland's upscale Pearl District.
One of the tent dwellers was Mr. Saldana.
Mr. Hollenbeck, a recent college graduate, tried to help Mr. Saldana, 54, get back on his feet by giving him food, money and camping supplies.
And as he learned the roots of Mr. Saldana's struggles, Mr. Hollenbeck became even more determined to help him.
"We are failing our unhoused neighbors every day," Mr. Hollenbeck said. "And it's something we can fix."
'Everything Just Seemed To Work'
Josh Alpert had a similar can-do attitude when he moved to Portland in the 1990s.
Mr. Alpert found an intense sense of community and "pride of place" among the many other transplants he met there.
"There was a sense that we are this Western city marching to our own drummer," said Mr. Alpert, who grew up in Pittsburgh and, after coming to Portland, quickly decided he wanted to go into government.
This vibrant civic life played out while the city's economy was growing and tourists were flocking to landmarks like Powell's City of Books, the nation's largest free-standing bookstore.
"Everything just seemed to work," said Mr. Alpert, who worked for former Mayor Charlie Hales, from 2013 to 2016, including as his chief of staff.
Then came the tents.
At first, many were concentrated downtown and a few others were scattered across the city. Some of the early tent dwellers arrived with the Occupy movement in 2011, which involved camping in public spaces across the United States to protest income inequality.
"Occupy sent the message to the houseless that it's OK to come out of the corners and be visible," Mr. Alpert said.
The protests ended, but Mr. Alpert said many of the Occupy activists stayed in tents "because they had nowhere to go."
The city's popularity as a destination for transplants was helping to push rents beyond the reach of people who lacked a financial safety net, and forcing some of them onto the streets.
As the city's point person on homelessness, Mr. Alpert supported new approaches to the housing shortage like the creation of temporary "villages" that could be run by homeless people themselves.
Instead of tents spread throughout the city, the villages, with names like Hazelnut Grove, were meant to be self-governing communities that empowered their residents.
"There was such a vital energy in the houseless community back then," said Vahid Brown, who has worked with the homeless population for many years and was involved in the "village movement."
Today, there are an estimated 6,300 homeless people in Multnomah County, which includes Portland. Only a relatively small number of them are still living in the homeless-run villages. Many live in tents under bridges, behind a hospital and in pine-scented groves. Some have fire pits. One has an American flag out front. A wheelchair. A library. A dead rat.
Mr. Alpert, who left government in 2016, says he has been blamed for allowing the tents to spread early on. "I wrestle even still with whether it was fair or unfair criticism," he said.
Within a few years, the tents became more entrenched. In 2018, the federal appeals court that covers Oregon and much of the West ruled that cities could not prohibit people from sleeping outside if an alternative shelter wasn't available.
Mr. Alpert still lives in Portland and likes to take long walks around the city. Over the past two years, he has seen at least 10 people overdosing, and has encountered a man walking around downtown naked and screaming.
"This is not the same issue that we were fighting," he said. "This is something different."
'Love You, Sis'
When Anthony Saldana arrived in the city in 2018, he first rented his own place and then bunked with his sister and her partner, Phillip.
But Mr. Saldana just couldn't make it work. As the pandemic wore into 2021, Mr. Saldana left his sister's house and started sleeping outside.
He returned regularly for "Anthony Day" -- Ms. Richardson's day off from her job at a local grocery store. She served him meat lover's pizza, while he did his laundry and took a shower.
In the morning, Mr. Saldana headed back to his tent.
He would say goodbye and leave. No hugs or even a fist bump. His sister said Mr. Saldana didn't like to be touched.
Mr. Saldana was 4 years old when he went to live with a relative in California, who abused him until he was a teenager, his sister said.
Mr. Saldana was eventually diagnosed with depression, which he often tried to treat with alcohol and meth. While he was working for Home Depot, his sister said, the company gave him time off from work to attend a month of rehab.
Ms. Richardson said her brother wasn't easy to be around when he was high and paranoid. But they all looked forward to Anthony Day.
"Thanks for dinner, it was awesome," Mr. Saldana messaged after a visit in September. "Have a wonderful day. Love you sis."
"You're welcome," Ms. Richardson wrote back. "Stay safe. Love you."
2 Days, 7 Deadly Overdoses
The summer of 2020, after the killing of George Floyd, was a tumultuous time in many American cities, but particularly in Portland.
Protesters clashed with the police in the downtown streets from May through that fall, resulting in more than 1,000 arrests.
Sgt. Jerry Cioeta, of the Portland Police Bureau, worked 71 days with only three days off during the unrest. His hearing was damaged after an explosive thrown by a protester hit him in the hip.
After the street battles ended and Sergeant Cioeta resumed patrols, he soon found himself in a changed city.
In November 2020, amid the national reckoning over policing and criminal justice, Oregon voters by a wide margin approved a ballot measure that lowered the penalties for possessing small amounts of drugs like meth and opioids.
While an increasing number of states no longer criminally charge people for using marijuana, Oregon took the bold step of decriminalizing the possession of "hard drugs."
When the police in Oregon see someone using these drugs, they can hand out a $ 100 ticket and a card listing a hotline for addiction treatment.
Known as Measure 110, the law was meant to focus the government's efforts on treating addiction, not on arresting users.
At the same time, it allocated millions of dollars in additional funding for addiction services across Oregon. But the new money was slow to roll out.
Sergeant Cioeta, who oversees a bike squad that patrols downtown Portland, believes Measure 110 is fueling more drug use by sending the false message that "all drugs are legal."
Others say that drug use has been common in Portland for decades and that Measure 110 has only brought the problem more out into the open.
Fentanyl was not a major focus of the discussions around decriminalization because it was not as widely used as it is now.
In 2020, the year voters approved the measure, 69 people in Multnomah County fatally overdosed from synthetic opioids, mainly fentanyl, according to the county health department.
Last year, such overdoses killed 209 people in the county, and the drug is smoked openly on Portland's downtown streets.
Fifty times more powerful than heroin, fentanyl sets off a high that "human brains have never seen before," said Dr. Andy Mendenhall, who runs Central City Concern, one of Portland's largest nonprofit providers of mental health and homeless services.
"It makes it harder for folks to stay in recovery," he said at a locally televised forum about addiction.
Fentanyl is often being used with other drugs, such as a synthetic form of meth, which outreach workers and the police say is also contributing to the increasingly volatile behavior on the streets.
Amid an outcry over Measure 110, the Oregon House recently passed a bill that would create stiffer consequences for possession of certain amounts of fentanyl.
Over two days in mid-May, seven people died of overdoses across Portland. One person died in a car, another in a tent and a third in a grassy area, three blocks from Powell's City of Books.
'He Wanted Me To Know'
When Jakob Hollenbeck graduated from the University of Oregon last year and moved to the Pearl District, a neighborhood of loft apartments and nice restaurants, he was keenly aware of Portland's troubles.
Mr. Hollenbeck wasn't afraid of the crime or homelessness, but he was upset with how the city was dealing with these issues.
Under Mayor Ted Wheeler, a Democrat, the city had been steadily stepping up the removal of tents and trying to move people into shelters.
But many of the people being displaced simply packed up their belongings and moved their tents to another patch of sidewalk.
Recognizing that many people struggling with addiction and mental illness do not want to live in a shelter, the Wheeler administration is developing several large encampment sites that will house people in "pods," small basic structures with heating and air-conditioning units.
These pod clusters are different from many of the villages that sprung up a decade ago, because government contractors will supervise them.
"There is nothing humane about living outside in the elements, and I have sought to change that," Mr. Wheeler said in an interview.
Preliminary results from a recent survey show that while the number of people who are homeless has risen, the portion who have been homeless for extended periods fell this year; officials said more people were also using shelters this year.
Mr. Hollenbeck, who is a believer in progressive approaches, said the city can only truly solve the problem by providing more affordable housing and mental health services. In the meantime, he said, citizens needed to step in to help their neighbors.
Mr. Hollenbeck raised $ 3,000 on GoFundMe to buy his neighbors camping supplies, and he borrowed his parents' car to help Mr. Saldana relocate after his tent was taken down.
When Mr. Hollenbeck, a paralegal, learned that Mr. Saldana had been hit by a car, he helped prepare a lawsuit against the company that had insured the car involved in the accident.
Then, Mr. Saldana returned the favor.
One night last December, Mr. Hollenbeck was walking home with takeout when a man approached him and demanded his food. When Mr. Hollenbeck refused, the man brandished a shard of glass and said he was going to stab him.
Mr. Saldana and another man bounded out of their tents and stood between Mr. Hollenbeck and the man with the shard, who was also homeless. Mr. Saldana yelled at the man to leave, which he did.
"I don't know what would have happened to me if he hadn't done that," said Mr. Hollenbeck, who was interviewed by local news outlets about Mr. Saldana's courageous act.
A few weeks after the incident, Mr. Saldana told Mr. Hollenbeck about the abuse that he had suffered as a child and how it had shaped his life.
"He wanted me to know that's why he lived on the street," Mr. Hollenbeck recalled. "But he said he couldn't do it much longer."
'People Act Like There's Not Enough'
Just as Portland has attracted college-educated transplants, it has also offered respite to people from around the country who are living on the margins.
Kaetly and Irida Wren were unemployed and sleeping in their car in Memphis in the spring of 2021. Shunned by certain family members, the transgender couple saw few options in the South.
"Let's go to Portland," Kaetly remembers saying.
Kaetly, 21, was inspired by the city's protests. An opioid user, she also heard that heroin was plentiful in Portland. Irida, 26, was told the city offered generous homeless services.
The couple packed up their Nissan Altima and made the 2,200-mile drive. They found support from social workers and groups like Street Roots, which publishes a newspaper focused on homeless issues.
On many nights, they stayed in shelters, but they said camping on the streets was easier.
Government data and interviews with homeless residents underscore Portland's lure, far and wide. A Houston woman whose home was destroyed by Hurricane Harvey. A New Jersey activist who came for the Occupy protests more than a decade ago. A St. Louis woman who had been sexually abused by a relative.
The couple had hoped to find a sense of community in the encampments.
Instead, they encountered "infighting," which they attributed partly to fentanyl.
The pull of the drug is so strong that many users are paranoid that supplies are running out, Kaetly said.
"People act like there is not enough of it on the streets for all of us. When in reality, there is more of it on the streets than there ever has been," she said.
On the night of April 18, the couple were in their tent across from a church when a man slashed the side of the tent and attacked Irida with a knife.
She was stabbed six times in the torso and hands, according to the police report, and was "fainting" shortly after officers arrived on the scene.
They planned to head back to Tennessee last month. Portland "is definitely not what I expected," Irida said.
Carrots or Sticks?
There are days when Portland is not what Jessie Burke, a co-owner of the Society Hotel, expected, either.
When a woman burst into her hotel lobby and wrestled with two employees. Or when she watched another tent dweller bang her head bloody against a storefront window.
Ms. Burke, who with her husband opened the boutique hotel in the Old Town neighborhood in 2015, believes that Portland can recover but that it needs to adjust its attitudes toward homelessness.
In recent years, she said, the city has been too permissive about camping and people using hard drugs in public places.
"Some people respond to carrots, and some respond to sticks," Ms. Burke said. "But we have used carrots here."
She is encouraged by the encampment removals, which have reduced the number of tents in the area around her hotel.
But she said government officials needed to compel more homeless people into mental health and addiction services.
"A lot of people say, 'How do we get the old Portland back?"' Ms. Burke said. "I think we need to look at the lessons learned from this time and to get to something else."
Anthony's Day
While some debate the city's future, Mr. Hollenbeck has been focused on the immediate needs of his homeless neighbors.
Before leaving for a trip in early March, Mr. Hollenbeck checked in on Mr. Saldana.
You need anything, Anthony?
When there was no answer from inside the tent, Mr. Hollenbeck figured his neighbor was sleeping.
Two weeks later, when Mr. Hollenbeck returned, there was still no sign of Mr. Saldana.
"Haven't seen you around lately -- hope you are good," Mr. Hollenbeck wrote in an email to Mr. Saldana on April 13.
Five days later, the police received a call about a body found by a worker preparing to remove Mr. Saldana's tent.
According to a police report, the body had been "unnoticed for several weeks," and investigators struggled to identify him through fingerprints. Eventually, the police determined it was Mr. Saldana.
He died from a fentanyl overdose, his sister said.
Not long after his friend's death, Mr. Hollenbeck got word that the insurance company was offering to compensate Mr. Saldana for the injuries he sustained when he was hit by the car.
He would have received $ 16,600, enough to cover many months of rent.
"The conditions that we have created as a society didn't let me get that money to him in time," Mr. Hollenbeck said. "That is something that haunts me."
Ms. Richardson appreciates what Mr. Hollenbeck did to support and comfort her brother. And she will hold on to the image of her brother standing up to protect his young neighbor.
It was Portland at its best, and proof to her that the city's ethos of community endures.
But in the end, that wasn't enough to save her brother from the hurt that followed him wherever he went.
The last time she saw him was on Feb. 26 when he visited her house for an Anthony Day.
He hated having his picture taken, so when she saw him asleep in the living room that day, Ms. Richardson secretly snapped a photo.
He was stretched out on the couch, which was draped in a large blanket patterned like the American flag. His head rested where the stars and stripes came together.
Ms. Richardson posted the image on Facebook after his death. "I love you Anthony," she wrote. "And know that you are now at peace."

Bo Goldman, 90, Who Adapted 'Cuckoo's Nest' for Film, Is Dead: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He was a struggling writer when he won an Academy Award for "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." He won another for "Melvin and Howard."
Bo Goldman, one of Hollywood's most admired screenwriters, who took home Oscars for his work on "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" (1975) and "Melvin and Howard" (1980), died on Tuesday in Helendale, Calif. He was 90.
A son-in-law, the director Todd Field, confirmed the death. He did not specify a cause.
Mr. Goldman was struggling to make a living as a writer until the director Milos Forman saw the script he had written for a project called "Shoot the Moon" -- his first screenplay -- and, impressed, invited him to take a crack at adapting Ken Kesey's novel "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" for the screen.
The resulting movie, which starred Jack Nicholson as a rebellious new patient who disrupts a psychiatric ward, came out in 1975 and was a career maker. Mr. Goldman and Lawrence Hauben, who shared screenwriting credit, won the Oscar for best screenplay adapted from other material; the movie was also named best picture and earned Oscars for Mr. Forman, Mr. Nicholson and Louise Fletcher, who played the fierce Nurse Ratched.
"Even then I hung my head," Mr. Goldman wrote in a 1981 essay for The New York Times about the insecurities of a writer's life. "After all, I had adapted somebody else's work; was it really mine?"
It may not have helped that Mr. Kesey denounced the adaptation.
If that doubt had nagged him, it had certainly been dispelled when his original screenplay for "Melvin and Howard" (1980) won him his second Oscar, this time for best screenplay written directly for the screen. That movie was based on the story of Melvin Dummar, a Utah gas station owner who claimed that Howard Hughes, in a handwritten will, had left him a share of his vast fortune.
Vincent Canby, writing in The Times, called it "a satiric expression of the American Dream in the closing years of the 20th century." The New York Film Critics Circle gave Mr. Goldman its best-screenplay award. (The film's director, Jonathan Demme, also won. But the organization named "Ordinary People" and not "Melvin and Howard" the best movie of the year.)
Mr. Goldman worked with the director Martin Brest on two films, "Scent of a Woman" (1992) and "Meet Joe Black" (1998).
"People call him the screenwriter's screenwriter," Mr. Brest said in a phone interview. "I called him the man with the X-ray ears, because he had a pitch-perfect recall of the nuances of a comment that someone made to someone 50 years prior -- he could reproduce the tone, and the reason he remembered it is because the tone told the whole story."
Mr. Goldman would draw on those memories to shape characters, as he did for "Scent of a Woman," the story of a blind retired Army officer and the prep-school student hired to take care of him, for which he received another Oscar nomination. Al Pacino played the blind man; Mr. Goldman told The Times that he borrowed aspects of his father, one of his brothers and his Army first sergeant in writing the part.
Mr. Brest said that Mr. Goldman was an adept collaborator, not only with other screenwriters but also with directors and others involved in the moviemaking process.
"He thought of himself as a filmmaker rather than a writer," he said. "He was part of the creation of a film."
Mr. Brest recalled that for "Scent of a Woman," which was based on an Italian movie, "Profumo di Donna," he and Mr. Goldman began by just having long, meandering chats.
"Finally I said to him, 'We've been talking for two weeks and having the greatest time, but shouldn't we get to work?"' Mr. Brest recalled. "And he said that Mike Nichols told him, 'The digressions are the work, or part of the work."'
Sure enough, much of what they had talked about -- childhood memories, people they'd known -- ended up being reflected in the script.
Robert Spencer Goldman was born on Sept. 10, 1932, in New York City. His mother, Lillian (Levy) Goldman, was a millinery model, and his father, Julian, operated Julian Goldman Stores, a clothing chain that had 42 stores in 11 states at one point but was derailed by the Depression. Four months before Mr. Goldman was born, the company filed for bankruptcy.
"I was the son of this kind of displaced merchant prince," Mr. Goldman told The Times in 1993.
Though the family fell on hard times, Mr. Goldman was able to attend Phillips Exeter Academy and then Princeton, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1953.
At Princeton, he participated in shows of the Princeton Triangle Club, a college theater troupe. "I learned how to write there," he said in an oral history recorded in 2000 for the Writers Guild Foundation.
While writing for the college newspaper as Bob Goldman, a typesetter accidentally left off the second "b" in his name. Mr. Goldman liked it and later legally changed his name to Bo.
After three years in the Army -- he was stationed in the Marshall Islands, where tests of nuclear bombs were being conducted -- he became an assistant to Jule Styne, the composer. He also wrote introductory patter and other tidbits for live television programs.
He aspired to a playwriting career and earned a Broadway credit in 1959 as one of the lyricists for "First Impressions," a musical based on Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice" that Mr. Styne's company produced. The show had a starry cast that included Farley Granger, Polly Bergen and Hermione Gingold, but it lasted only 92 performances.
Mr. Goldman continued working in television, including as a script editor and associate producer on the anthology series "Playhouse 90." But success as a writer proved elusive.
He had married Mabel Rathbun Ashforth in 1954, and they eventually had six children. He credited her with keeping the family afloat in the lean years by opening a nursery school in their home and then running a food store called Loaves and Fishes in Sagaponack, N.Y., on Long Island.
He said that in this period -- the late 1960s and early '70s -- he saw families of his contemporaries falling apart and was moved to write his first screenplay, "Shoot the Moon," about a marriage in crisis because of the husband's affair. It won many admirers -- including Mr. Forman -- but no producers wanted to make it because, Mr. Goldman often said, the story struck too close to home for them.
After his success with "Cuckoo's Nest," "The Rose" (1979) and "Melvin and Howard," however, "Shoot the Moon" finally did get made, by the director Alan Parker in 1982. Diane Keaton and Albert Finney, as the struggling couple, were both nominated for Golden Globe Awards.
Mr. Goldman's other screenwriting credits include "The Flamingo Kid" (1984), "Little Nikita" (1988) and "City Hall" (1996).
In 2017, when New York magazine asked working screenwriters to discuss the best screenwriters of all time, Eric Roth ("Forrest Gump") singled out Mr. Goldman's "audacious originality, his understanding of social mores, his ironic sense of humor, and his outright anger at being human, and all with his soft-spoken grace and eloquent simplicity."
Mr. Goldman lived in Rockport, Maine. His wife died in 2017. A son, Jesse, died in 1981. He is survived by another son, Justin Ashforth; four daughters, Mia Goldman, Amy Goldman, Diana Rathbun and Serena Rathbun; seven grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.
Mr. Brest said Mr. Goldman was able to create memorable characters through small details.
"His remembrance of nuances, things that people don't know they're revealing but that reveal volumes -- that was his art form," he said.
He also said he has often repeated something Mr. Goldman once told him: "Your life," Mr. Goldman said, "is what's not in the obituary."

In Britain, Trump Ally Stokes Feud With Bank: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Nigel Farage, a political insurgent and ally of Donald J. Trump, exposed his bank for dropping him over "reputational risks." Some analysts say he could parlay his situation into a comeback.
When Nigel Farage campaigned for a fellow populist, Donald J. Trump, in 2020, he seemed like a faded star seeking the spotlight abroad after it had swung past him at home. Mr. Farage, who helped mobilize the pro-Brexit vote in 2016, was marginalized in Britain, then consumed by the pandemic.
No longer: For three weeks, Mr. Farage, has been back on the front pages of British papers, with an attention-grabbing claim that his exclusive private bank, Coutts, dropped him as a customer because of his polarizing politics.
Early on Wednesday, after Mr. Farage's allegations were largely vindicated, the chief executive of his bank's parent, NatWest Group, resigned after she admitted improperly discussing his bank account with a BBC journalist. The chief executive, Alison Rose, said she was guilty of a "serious error of judgment."
For Mr. Farage, who expertly stoked the dispute on social media and with appearances on the TV network GB News, the drama catapulted him back into the limelight. It was a striking turn of events for a political insurgent who became, for many, a reviled symbol of Brexit, and later, a culture warrior on right-wing television.
Now, facing expulsion from Coutts, a bank founded in 1692 that serves members of the British royal family, Mr. Farage suddenly began getting expressions of sympathy from some improbable places.
"He shouldn't have had his personal details revealed like that," Keir Starmer, the leader of the opposition Labour Party said on the BBC Radio 5 Live show. "It doesn't matter who you are; that's a general rule," Mr. Starmer said, adding that Ms. Rose's departure was warranted by her mishandling of the case.
Among Mr. Farage's stoutest defenders was Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who said on Twitter, "No one should be barred from using basic services for their political views. Free speech is the cornerstone of our democracy."
Pressure from Mr. Sunak and the chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt, hastened Ms. Rose's downfall after she confessed to being the source for the BBC report, which claimed, erroneously, that Mr. Farage had been dropped because he did not have enough money in his accounts. The government owns 39 percent of NatWest, which in turn owns Coutts.
The episode, analysts said, underscores the power that Mr. Farage, a former head of the U.K. Independence Party, still wields over the Conservatives. The Tories have long feared losing the votes of Brexiteers, who were critical to their electoral landslide in 2019, to whatever populist party is currently identified with Mr. Farage.
Though Mr. Farage, 59, stepped down in 2021 as head of his latest party, Reform U.K., he is the host of a GB News talk show and remains an outspoken voice on issues like asylum seekers crossing the English Channel in small boats. Prodded partly by Mr. Farage's commentary, Mr. Sunak has made curbing the influx of small boats one of the five major goals of his government.
"They're very aware they need to hold on to the Farage-friendly voters they picked up in 2019," said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, "They're being driven in that direction, too, by the right-wing print media. This isn't the first time this sort of thing has happened -- and it won't be the last."
Mr. Farage isn't satisfied yet. He is demanding the ouster of NatWest's chairman, Howard Davies, and the chief executive of Coutts, Peter Flavel. And he says he will fight on behalf of thousands of other people whose accounts he says have been unfairly closed.
"You can't live or survive in the modern world without a bank account -- you become a nonperson," Mr. Farage said on GB News on Wednesday. "The whole banking industry culture has gone wrong. We need big changes in the law."
What exactly Mr. Farage has in mind is not clear. But his campaign plays into a fervid political climate in Britain, which suggests that his critique might gain traction. The Conservatives, trailing Labour in opinion polls by double digits, are seizing on social and culture issues to try to galvanize their voters.
Mr. Sunak asserted this week that the Labour Party was in league with criminal gangs and unscrupulous lawyers in promoting the flow of asylum seekers across the channel. He presented himself as the bulwark against this illegal immigration, the kind of claim Mr. Farage might have made when he was in politics.
"If Farage is smart, he will use this as a runway to some kind of political comeback," said Matthew Goodwin, a professor of politics at the University of Kent whose recent book, "Values, Voice and Virtue," claims that Britain is ruled by an out-of-touch elite that is well to the left of the broader population.
"This is just the tip of the iceberg," Mr. Goodwin said. "The institutions, like the banks, are dominated by people who lean much further to the cultural left than many voters and who often do not even realize they are being political."
Such sweeping assertions are open to debate, of course. In the United States, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida has had mixed results going after what he calls the "woke" policies of corporate giants like the Walt Disney Company.
What makes Mr. Farage's story striking is that he turned out to be right on the facts of the banking case -- and some bastions of the British banking and media establishment turned out to be wrong.
In late June, Mr. Farage said on social media that his bank told him it planned to close his account in July. Seven other banks, he said, turned him down when he tried to open a new account. He said he believed he had been flagged as a "politically exposed person," meaning he was vulnerable to bribery by foreign governments, and therefore a risk to the bank.
In early July, the BBC reported that the bank, now identified as Coutts, dropped Mr. Farage because he was not maintaining adequate account balances -- and that his politics had nothing to do with it. But on July 18, Mr. Farage made public a 40-page document he obtained from the bank, which painted a different picture.
Mr. Farage, the report said, is "considered by many to be a disingenuous grifter," often criticized for racist or xenophobic statements. Such statements, it said, put Mr. Farage at odds with the bank's goal of being an "inclusive organization." The report also noted that he is an ally of Mr. Trump's and a fan of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, though the bank's risk committee found no evidence of "direct links" between him and the Russian government.
"There are significant reputational risks to the bank in being associated with him," the report concluded, recommending that Coutts wind down its relationship with Mr. Farage after the expiration of a mortgage
The BBC's economics editor, Simon Jack, and the chief executive of BBC News, Deborah Turness, apologized to Mr. Farage -- as did Ms. Rose, who confirmed that she was the source for its report. She expressed regret for discussing his account, as well as for "the deeply inappropriate language contained in those papers."
For Mr. Farage, who has sometimes seemed adrift since Britain left the European Union, it seemed the springboard to a new cause, if not a return to politics.
"It signals a big campaign on behalf of the huge number of ordinary people who've been de-banked and have had no one to speak up for them," Mr. Farage said through a spokeswoman at GB News.

Strikes Mean Game Shows And Reruns: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: TV viewers across the U.S. will see fewer new scripted shows, a trend that could continue well into next year if the walkouts continue.
Scripted television series premiering at a slower pace. The "New Releases" and "Just Added" banners on streaming services piling up with reality shows, documentaries and international fare. Ninety-minute episodes of "Survivor" and "60 Minutes." A steady diet of Pat Sajak, Steve Harvey and David Spade hosting game shows in prime time.
The fallout from strikes that have tens of thousands of actors and writers walking picket lines, along with industrywide cost-cutting, will soon be felt by Americans watching television -- and it will be a shift that could continue well into next year.
For the better part of a decade, viewers have been inundated with dozens of new scripted shows every month, an overwhelming era in entertainment known as Peak TV.
The days of 600 new scripted shows a year are officially over and unlikely to return. Roughly a year ago, nearly every major Hollywood studio started hitting the brakes on new series orders amid fears of sliding share prices, a downturn in the advertising market and a new imperative to make streaming services profitable.
Then the walkouts began. The writers have been on strike since May 2, which effectively shut down roughly 80 percent of scripted television productions, according to some estimates. When the actors went on strike on July 14, they essentially brought the entire American scripted production assembly line to a halt.
Depending on the duration of the labor disputes -- many Hollywood studios are preparing for the contingency that at least one of the walkouts continues until the end of the year -- the one-two punch of the reduced series orders and the strikes will upend the cadence of new television series well into 2024, researchers and executives said.
"The consequence for the wider TV industry is going to be a very prolonged downturn in output," said Richard Broughton, the executive director of Ampere Analysis, a research firm.
The broadcast networks will feel the effects first. For ABC, there will be zero new episodes of popular series like "Grey's Anatomy" and "Abbott Elementary" come September. Its lineup will instead be populated by reruns, old movies, and reality and game shows, including "Celebrity Wheel of Fortune," "Judge Steve Harvey" and two spinoffs of "The Bachelor." Likewise, Fox will turn to a series of animated, reality and unscripted shows, including a new game show, "Snake Oil," hosted by Mr. Spade.
CBS will feature plenty of reality series and bring old episodes of the cable and streaming hit "Yellowstone" to network prime time. It will also import the British version of the sitcom "Ghosts," which it adapted into a hit that the strikes have now halted. NBC will show a series from Canada called "Transplant," unscripted shows, repeats and new episodes of the "Magnum P.I." reboot that have already been filmed.
If the labor disputes drag into October, a majority of the American television premieres expected to air by January will experience some form of delay, a trend that would continue for much of the rest of the year, according to Ampere. If the strike lasts until the end of 2023, the effects will be even more significant.
A slowdown was already underway. In the first half of this year, orders for new series by companies including Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix, Paramount and Disney declined between 20 percent and 56 percent from a year earlier, according to Ampere. Executives chalked that up to both a continuation of the caution from last year and concerns about a likely writers' strike. (The actors' strike caught many more executives off guard.)
Matt Roush, a senior critic at TV Guide magazine, said he had begun noticing over the last few months that new seasons of scripted series were arriving at a slower cadence. "It doesn't feel like a fire hose anymore," he said. "It feels like a steady drizzle."
For streaming services, some productions can take more than a year to complete, so new shows are still snaking their through the pipeline.
Netflix said last week that the final season of "The Crown" and new seasons of other popular series like "Virgin River" and "Heartstopper" would premiere this year. HBO still has "True Detective" set to premiere this year, as well as "The Regime," a limited series starring Kate Winslet that will premiere in 2024. The latest season of the "Game of Thrones" spinoff "House of the Dragon" -- which is not affected by the actors' strike and has continued filming overseas -- also remains scheduled for next year.
Still, networks like HBO, as well as its Max streaming service, will feel the effects of a prolonged walkout. The writers' strike forced the production of the new Max "Batman" spinoff, "The Penguin," to shut down partway through filming. New seasons of hits like "The White Lotus" and "Euphoria" are likely to be pushed to 2025.
New seasons of other popular series, including "Stranger Things," "Yellowstone" and "Severance," all suspended production after the writers' strike began, and will also be delayed.
Netflix already said it would have an additional $ 1.5 billion in cash flow this year because of the strikes -- money that would otherwise have been spent on new series orders and productions for American TV series.
There are questions over whether viewers will begin to get trigger-happy around the "cancel your subscription" buttons once the pace of new, splashy scripted titles in their streaming queue starts sputtering.
"People begin to notice if there's not something new, or if you're not opening the app anymore," said Julia Alexander, the director of strategy at Parrot Analytics, a research firm.
Still, she said, many studios, especially Netflix, will be more insulated than during the 100-day writers' strike in 2007, when the broadcast networks still reigned. Netflix can now rely on a steady supply of unscripted shows and international shows, and a deep library of content, for example.
However, the longer the strike lasts, the more risk there is for everyone.
"All platforms will begin to notice long-term impacts the more the strike goes on," Ms. Alexander said. "This will really come to light in spring 2024 and beyond, depending on the length of the strike."

Predictably, Summer's New Political Flashpoint Is Wrapped in Pink: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Political figures of all types grabbed for the legs of a doll-turned-movie-turned-cultural moment, with predictable results.
Last week, Representative Matt Gaetz and his wife, Ginger, arrived at a Washington reception for "Barbie" in matching pink, grinning in photos along the "pink carpet," mingling among guests sipping pink cocktails, admiring a life-size pink toy box.
They left with political ammunition.
"The Barbie I grew up with was a representation of limitless possibilities, embracing diverse careers and feminine empowerment," Mrs. Gaetz wrote on Twitter. "The 2023 Barbie movie, unfortunately, neglects to address any notion of faith or family, and tries to normalize the idea that men and women can't collaborate positively (yuck)."
When another account scolded Mr. Gaetz, the hard-right and perpetually stunt-seeking Florida congressman, for attending the event at all -- citing the casting of a trans actor as a doctor Barbie -- Mr. Gaetz replied with a culture-warring double feature.
"If you let the trans stop you from seeing Margo Robbie," he said, leaving the "T" off the first name of the film's star, "the terrorists win."
The non-terroristic winners were many after the film's estimated $ 155 million debut: Ms. Robbie and Greta Gerwig, the film's director, finding an eager audience for their pink-hued feminist opus; the Warner Bros. marketing team, whose ubiquitous campaigns plainly paid off; the film industry itself, riding "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer" to its most culturally dominant weekend in years.
But few outcomes were as nominally inexplicable (and probably inevitable) as the film's instant utility to political actors and opportunists of all kinds. For a modern take on what was long a politically fraught emblem of toxic body image and reductive social norms, no choice was too small, no turn too ideology-affirming or apparently nefarious, for a bipartisan coalition of commentators and elected officials to see value in its dissection.
"I have, like, pages and pages of notes," Ben Shapiro, the popular conservative commentator, said in a lengthy video review, which began with him setting a doll aflame and did not grow more charitable. (He said his producers "dragged" him to the theater.)
"I took a tequila shot every time Barbie said patriarchy ... only just woke up," wrote Elon Musk. (Mr. Shapiro, diligently but less colorfully, said he had counted the word "more than 10 times.")
"Here are 4 ways Barbie embraces California values," the office of Gavin Newsom, the state's Democratic governor, wrote in a thread hailing Barbie as a champion of climate activism, "hitting the roads in her electric vehicle," and of destigmatizing mental health care.
If there was a time in the culture when a giant summer film event was something of an American unifier -- a moment to share over-buttered popcorn through big-budget shoot-'em-ups and sagas of insatiable sharks -- that time is not 2023.
And, as ever, the political class's performative investment in "Barbie" -- the outrage and the embrace -- can seem mostly like a winking bit.
What to make of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Democrat of Michigan, posting a Barbie meant to resemble herself beside the Instagram caption, "Come on Barbie, let's go govern"?
What does it mean, exactly, when Senator Raphael Warnock, Democrat of Georgia, says of himself, "This Ken is pushing to end maternal mortality"?
Certainly, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, has summoned practiced gravity in accusing "Barbie" of working to appease the Chinese. (Some Republicans have fixated on a scene that features a crudely drawn map that supposedly depicts the so-called nine-dash line, which indicates Chinese ownership of oceanic territory that is disputed under international law. Vietnam has banned showings of the movie in the country over that image.)
"Obviously, the little girls that are going to see Barbie, none of them are going to have any idea what those dashes mean," Mr. Cruz told Fox News. "This is really designed for the eyes of the Chinese censors, and they're trying to kiss up to the Chinese Communist Party because they want to make money selling the movie."
The response on the right is not a one-off. For a generation of conservative personalities, weaned on Andrew Breitbart's much-cited observation that "politics is downstream of culture," Hollywood and other ostensibly liberal bastions are to be confronted head-on, lest their leanings ensnare young voters without a fight.
Recent years have provided ample evidence, some on the right say, for a "go woke, go broke" view that progressivism is bad business. Last year's apolitically patriotic "Top Gun: Maverick" was a smashing success, as was this year's kid-friendly "The Super Mario Bros. Movie." By contrast, critics on the right contended that Disney's remake of "The Little Mermaid," with its title character portrayed by the Black actress Halle Bailey, failed to match its producers' hopes. (Of course, there is no way to trace exactly what determines any movie's success or failure, and many observers adhere to the screenwriter William Goldman's axiom: "Nobody knows anything.")
"Barbie" cannot be said to have gone broke. But its purported politics, conservatives have argued, did damage it by making it less entertaining -- "a lecture," in the words of The Federalist's Rich Cromwell, "that self-identifies as a movie."
Kyle Smith, a reviewer at The Wall Street Journal, complained that the film "contains more swipes at 'the patriarchy' than a year's worth of Ms. magazine."
The film seems at times (gentle spoiler alert) to be engaging with "the patriarchy" ironically, infusing it with knowing Southern California vapidity, décor that seems inspired by hair metal and a heavy emphasis on weight lifting and "brewskis."
When it comes time (less gentle spoiler alert) to reclaim Barbie Land, the Barbies distract the Kens by indulging their tendency for exaggerated gestures of malehood like playing acoustic guitar and insisting on showing a date "The Godfather" while talking over it.
Mr. Shapiro has sounded unconvinced that the movie is broadly in on its own jokes.
"The actual argument the movie is making is that if women enjoy men, it's because they have been brainwashed by the patriarchy," he said in his review.
He called the film, with a straight face, two hours he will rue wasting as he sits on his deathbed.
"The things I do," he said, "for my audience."

There's No Escaping Trump: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Bret Stephens: Hi, Gail. We skipped our conversation last week because I was in Ukraine. But even from there, it was hard to miss the news about Donald Trump's most recent pending indictment. Your thoughts?
Gail Collins: Bret, I'm in awe of your Ukraine expedition but slightly depressed to realize that Americans can't escape Trump, even when they're at a hospital in Irpin.
Bret: Trump returning to the White House and pulling the plug on American support for Kyiv is the second-biggest threat to Ukraine, after Vladimir Putin. And did you hear Trump call the Chinese dictator Xi Jinping both "smart" and "brilliant"?
But back to the latest potential indictment ....
Gail: Criminal-justice-wise, I think it's very important to assure the country that nobody, including a president, can just get away with urging an angry crowd to attack the Capitol.
Bret: Especially a president.
Gail: But politically, I have a terrible suspicion that indictment will help him in the Republican primaries. So sad the law-and-order party has apparently lost interest in the law -- or, for that matter, order -- when it doesn't suit their purpose.
Bret: If there were truth in advertising, Republicans would have to rename themselves the Opposite Party. They were the party of law and order. Now they want to abolish the F.B.I. They were the party that revered the symbols of the nation. Now they think the Jan. 6 riots were like a "normal tourist visit." They were the party of moral character and virtue. Now they couldn't care less that their standard-bearer consorted with a porn star. They were the party of staring down the Evil Empire. Now they're Putin's last best hope. They were the party of free trade. Now they're protectionists. They were the party that cheered the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, which argued that corporations had free speech. Now they are being sued by Disney because the company dared express an opinion they dislike. They were the party that once believed that "family values don't stop at the Rio Grande," as George W. Bush put it. Now some of them want to invade Mexico.
Gail: Woof.
Bret: So that makes me want to ask you about your column last week. What's not to like about No Labels?
Gail: Bret, gonna skip my normal diatribe on the evils of Joe Lieberman, the spokesman and symbolic head of No Labels, which is running around the country trying to get a presidential line on ballots in a bunch of states.
Bret: Lieberman may be our one irreconcilable difference. I love the guy.
Gail: My bottom line is that third parties -- even those led by people far better than Mr. L. -- are a danger to the American democratic system. You start a party that makes a big deal out of ... helping hummingbirds. Tell voters who don't love either of the two regular candidates that they can Vote Hummer and feel good. You won't win the election, but you can throw everything into chaos. In some states, that little shift could be enough to bestow victory somewhere you'd never have wanted it to go. Say the Crow Coalition.
Bret: I'd be opposed to No Labels if I were convinced that all it will do is take votes from Joe Biden and throw the election to Trump. But that depends on who takes the No Labels slot: If it's a former Democrat, it probably hurts Biden. If it's a former Republican, it could hurt Trump even more.
Gail: Maybe. I'd rather just make people pick between the two real possibilities -- each of them representing a broad coalition and certainly offering a stark choice. I don't like plotting to win by cluttering up the ballot.
Bret: But the main thing, Gail, is that I need a party I can vote for. And I think the feeling is shared by a growing fraction of voters who might be center left or center right but are increasingly appalled by progressive Democrats and reactionary Republicans. So any party that represents our views is good for democracy, not a threat to it.
Gail: No, no, Bret. Even if you vote for a third party that perfectly represents your views -- or at least your view on a favorite issue -- if it isn't going to win, you're throwing away your vote. A vote for the Green Party, for instance, is a vote that Biden would probably have gotten otherwise. Which means the Green Party is helping Trump.
Bret: I agree -- mostly. I used to vote exclusively for Republicans, even though I disagreed on a lot of social issues. Now I vote mostly for Democrats, even though I disagree on a lot of economic issues. But I've never before felt such a level of disaffection with both parties, which makes No Labels ... intriguing. We'll see if it goes anywhere.
Gail: OK, I've ranted enough. Let's talk about something important that no one ever wants to talk about: Congress. The big defense budget is being bogged down by some House Republicans who want to include right-wing social issues that everyone knows the Senate will never accept. Even the normal military promotions are stalled by one Republican senator, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, who wants to eliminate travel aid to enlisted women seeking abortions.
These are all supposed to be your guys. Explain what we can do about all this.
Bret: Well, this is just another way in which I'm totally appalled by so many of today's Republicans. They had no trouble effectively freezing and even reducing military spending for the sake of their debt-ceiling antics, despite claiming to be seriously concerned by the military threat from China (or Iran or Russia). And now they're committing the exact sin they routinely accuse liberals of doing: injecting a partisan social agenda into questions of national security.
But Gail, Congress is too depressing. Let's talk about the actors' and writers' strikes. Should we join them, at least morally speaking?
Gail: I see two big things about the strikes. One is complicated and important: How do you compensate the creative talent when movies and TV are available around the clock via streaming?
The other is more emotional and understandable: The creative talent is scrambling to get adequate pay while the top guys -- the producers and company executives -- are making a mountain of money from the current system.
In a word, I'm on the writer-actor side. How about you?
Bret: Don't tell anyone this, but I am, too. I think the strike is about more than the particulars of how the so-called creative class gets paid. It's really about whether there can be a creative class at all.
My working assumption is that within 20 years, if not much sooner, A.I. will be able to write, direct and act (via computer-generated images that are indistinguishable from real people) movies and TV shows. It will write credible novels and news stories and opinion columns and compose film scores and pop music. That may not really affect me, if only because I'll be close to retirement. But it will mean a growing number of creative endeavors will no longer easily find meaningful vocational outlets. It will amount to a kind of material degradation of human civilization that may prove irreversible.
Gail: Grab a picket sign!
Bret: Never thought I'd be a fan of any form of organized labor, but there it is. And it's also a good occasion to praise President Biden for trying to create some shared ethical guidelines for the development of A.I.
Gail: I'm the last one to make an informed prediction on anything relating to science and technology, but you're right: It's good to know we've got some principled leaders trying to figure things out.
Bret: Even though the depressing reality is that humanity doesn't have a particularly good track record of controlling new technologies, particularly when they can make some people richer or other people more powerful. The historian in me says the same might have been said with every past transformative technology, from the wheel to the printing press to nuclear energy. Maybe artificial intelligence will follow the same path. But A.I. is also the first technology I can think of that doesn't supplement human creativity but rather competes with it.
Gail: And gee, Bret, we've agreed about almost everything this week -- including organized labor! Next week I swear we'll talk about something that stirs up a fight.
Bret: I'm sure I'll have strong views about the "Oppenheimer" film once I've seen it. Have I ever mentioned that I think Harry Truman was completely right to drop the bombs?
Gail: We can compare thoughts then. Hope you get a chance to see "Oppenheimer" soon -- although I should warn you it did feel as if three hours was a long time to contemplate atomic warfare. In an old theater with squeaky seats.
I'm most certainly not an expert on World War II, but I hate the idea of killing something like 200,000 people to make a point about our nation's breakthrough in technological firepower.
Bret: History is filled with counterfactuals. I wonder how many American fighting men, including my grandfather -- and, for that matter, how many Japanese soldiers and civilians -- would have been killed if we had invaded the Japanese home islands the way we had to take Iwo Jima or Okinawa. I think the aggregate number would have been far higher.
Gail: I can see that our ongoing conversation about this is going to be hard and deep, Bret. I'll bring wine. And maybe we should also make it a point to see "Barbie" before we chat again. We can talk about global destruction and mass market capitalism at the same time.

'Barbie' Powers Past Box Office Predictions: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: With the biggest revenues since 2019, "Barbenheimer" gives the usual franchises a run for their money, selling out even predawn screenings.
The movie business lives!
Greta Gerwig's gender wars "Barbie" and Christopher Nolan's nuclear war "Oppenheimer" blew past already-stratospheric prerelease expectations at the weekend box office to collect a combined $ 235.5 million in the United States and Canada, an astounding total that sent a clear message to Hollywood: If you want to commandeer the culture, you must give moviegoers something new -- not just the same old threadbare franchises.
"Original storytelling executed in the right way has broken out in a really remarkable way," said Richard L. Gelfond, the chief executive of IMAX, which accounted for 26 percent of the "Oppenheimer" turnout in North America, selling out even 4 a.m. screenings. "These movies weren't sequels that looked the same as the last sequel in a long-running franchise. You might say people noticed."
The blockbuster turnout signaled that Hollywood has finally bounced back from the pandemic. All told, North American multiplexes had their biggest weekend since "Avengers: Endgame" arrived in April 2019. "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer" powered the domestic box office to about $ 302 million in total weekend ticket sales, with films like "Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One" and "Sound of Freedom" contributing to the balance.
"Barbie," a feminist manifesto wrapped in hot pink bubble gum, sold an estimated $ 155 million in tickets at domestic theaters, according to Comscore, which compiles box office data. The PG-13 comedy collected an additional $ 182 million overseas. "Barbie" was released by Warner Bros. and cost $ 145 million to make, not including marketing expenses, which were considerable.
Box office analysts, using complex formulas to forecast ticket sales, had expected "Barbie" to collect about $ 110 million in the United States and Canada. Worried that the movie might underperform expectations, as several big-budget releases have recently, including "Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One," Warner Bros. predicted a conservative $ 75 million.
It ended up as the biggest opening of Gerwig's career, by a moonshot, cementing her status as one of Hollywood's young "name" filmmakers -- directors who mainstream ticket buyers recognize as delivering singular work. (Jordan Peele is another, along with more established cohorts like Nolan and J.J. Abrams.) Gerwig, who wrote the comedic "Barbie" script with her partner, Noah Baumbach, previously directed "Little Women" (2019) and "Lady Bird" (2017). She has been nominated for three Oscars.
It was also the biggest opening on record for a female director, surpassing "Captain Marvel," which was co-directed by Anna Boden and had $ 153.4 million in initial ticket sales in 2019.
"This is a record-shattering opening," said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter on box office numbers. "No comedic film of any kind has opened higher than $ 85.9 million over a three-day weekend."
"Barbie" arrived as a full-blown cultural event, with thousands of moviegoers draping themselves in pink for screenings, doll memes flooding social media and marketers scrambling (sometimes awkwardly) to glom onto the moment. The audience was 65 percent female. "For a film this pink, you would have expected the audience to be closer to 90 percent female -- we got a ton of guys," said Jeff Goldstein, president of domestic distribution at Warner Bros. "It exploded everywhere: large markets, small markets, coast to coast."
Some theaters seemed to be caught off guard. One high-end theater in the Washington, D.C. suburbs went all out on promotion, with pink lights to highlight "Barbie" and a wall of movie posters featuring both films. But the theater may have miscalculated Saturday attendance. By the 10 p.m. showing, it had run out of multiple food items. It also lacked soft drinks and, amazingly, ice.
Another theater in Arlington, Va., had it worse: The air conditioning went out, leading to a sweltering experience. While the theater offered refunds, many ticket buyers stayed.
The question now is whether Hollywood can keep the momentum going. Studio executives have long pointed out that moviegoing begets moviegoing -- that the habit of watching movies in theaters is crucial. Coming up, however, studios are facing another crisis: A strike by unionized actors, which started on July 14, could force movie companies to push back coming films because striking stars cannot take part in publicity campaigns. "Challengers," a sports drama involving a love triangle and staring Zendaya, has already been pushed from September to April.
There are no talks scheduled between SAG-AFTRA, as the actors' union is known, and studios.
"Oppenheimer" helped fuel "Barbie" and vice versa, with their simultaneous release nicknamed Barbenheimer and movie fans captivated by their wild incongruity. Nolan's film, which cost Universal Pictures at least $ 100 million to make, not including a megawatt marketing campaign, is a three-hour period drama about Robert Oppenheimer, the man known as "the father of the atomic bomb." About 200,000 people purchased tickets to see "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer" as a double feature, according to the National Association of Theater Owners, a trade organization.
Universal said the R-rated "Oppenheimer" collected an estimated $ 80.5 million in the United States and Canada -- about 60 percent more than analysts had predicted before release -- and an additional $ 94 million overseas. The domestic audience was 62 percent male. Some IMAX locations playing "Oppenheimer" are sold out for the coming weeks, in particular venues playing the film in 70-millimeter format.
"Barbie" and "Oppenheimer" received euphoric reviews from critics. Ticket buyers gave each film an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls.
Hollywood urgently needed a weekend that exceeded -- or even met -- expectations. This was the year when moviegoing was finally supposed to bounce back from the pandemic, which closed many theaters for months and sped the growth of streaming services in homes. Until now, however, the box office has been mostly notable for disappointing turnouts for franchise sequels.
Blips of hope, including "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3," have been blotted out by underwhelming results, especially in the United States, for expensive franchise films like "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny," "Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania," "Shazam! Fury of the Gods," "The Flash" and "Fast X."
What is succeeding? Characters that have not been onscreen in recent memory ("The Super Mario Bros. Movie"), vivid new animation styles ("Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"), new chapters in series that are not as well worn ("Creed III") and movies that cater to audiences ignored by Hollywood ("Sound of Freedom," which has been promoted by the right).
For all of her world domination, Barbie has never before had her own big-budget movie. "Oppenheimer" is based on the 2005 biography "American Prometheus" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin.
The stronger-than-expected turnout for "Barbie" reflected, in part, a campaign by David Zaslav, the chief executive of Warner Bros. Discovery, to use the company's cross-promotional power in a new way. In the past, the conglomerate has remained stubbornly siloed, even as Disney and NBCUniversal have leveraged their empires to promote new movies.
Warner Bros. Discovery promoted "Barbie" on its television networks, for instance, with HGTV featuring a Dreamhouse competition series and Food Network incorporating Barbie into a "summer baking championship." More than 15 of the company's networks featured pink logos and other on-air promos.

Greta Gerwig’s gender wars “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s nuclear war “Oppenheimer” blew past already-stratospheric prerelease expectations at the weekend box office to collect a combined $235.5 million in the United States and Canada, an astounding total that sent a clear message to Hollywood: If you want to commandeer the culture, you must give moviegoers something new — not just the same old threadbare franchises.

Coming up, however, studios are facing another crisis: A strike by unionized actors, which started July 14, could force movie companies to push back coming films because striking stars cannot take part in publicity campaigns. “Challengers,” a sports drama involving a love triangle and starring Zendaya, has already been pushed from September to April.
There are no talks scheduled between SAG-AFTRA, as the actors union is known, and studios.
“Oppenheimer” helped fuel “Barbie” and vice versa, with their simultaneous release nicknamed Barbenheimer and movie fans captivated by their wild incongruity. Nolan’s film, which cost Universal Pictures at least $100 million to make, not including a megawatt marketing campaign, is a three-hour period drama about Robert Oppenheimer, the man known as “the father of the atomic bomb.” About 200,000 people had purchased tickets to see “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” as a double feature, according to the National Association of Theater Owners, a trade organization.
Universal said the R-rated “Oppenheimer” collected an estimated $80.5 million in the United States and Canada — about 60% more than analysts had predicted before release — and an additional $94 million overseas. The domestic audience was 62% male. Some IMAX locations playing “Oppenheimer” are sold out for the coming weeks, in particular venues playing the film in 70 mm.
“Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” received euphoric reviews from critics. Ticket buyers gave each film an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls.
Hollywood urgently needed a weekend that exceeded — or even met — expectations. This was the year when moviegoing was finally supposed to bounce back from the pandemic, which closed many theaters for months and sped the growth of streaming services in homes. Until now, however, the box office has been mostly notable for disappointing turnouts for franchise sequels.
Blips of hope, including “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” have been blotted out by underwhelming results, especially in the United States, for expensive franchise films such as “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” “Shazam! Fury of the Gods,” “The Flash” and “Fast X.”
What is succeeding? Characters that have not been on-screen in recent memory (“The Super Mario Bros. Movie”), vivid new animation styles (“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse”), new chapters in series that are not as well worn (“Creed III”) and movies that cater to audiences ignored by Hollywood (“Sound of Freedom,” which has been promoted by the right).
For all of her world domination, Barbie has never before had her own big-budget movie. “Oppenheimer” is based on the 2005 biography “American Prometheus” by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin.
The stronger-than-expected turnout for “Barbie” reflected, in part, a campaign by David Zaslav, the CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, to use the company’s cross-promotional power in a new way. In the past, the conglomerate has remained stubbornly siloed, even as Disney and NBCUniversal have leveraged their empires to promote new movies.
Warner Bros. Discovery promoted “Barbie” on its television networks, for instance, with HGTV featuring a Dreamhouse competition series and Food Network incorporating Barbie into a “summer baking championship.” More than 15 of the company’s networks featured pink logos and other on-air promos.

The movie business lives!
Greta Gerwig’s gender wars “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s nuclear war “Oppenheimer” blew past already-stratospheric prerelease expectations at the weekend box office to collect a combined $235.5 million in the United States and Canada, an astounding total that sent a clear message to Hollywood: If you want to commandeer the culture, you must give moviegoers something new — not just the same old threadbare franchises.
“Original storytelling executed in the right way has broken out in a really remarkable way,” said Richard L. Gelfond, the CEO of IMAX, which accounted for 26% of the “Oppenheimer” turnout in North America, selling out even 4 a.m. screenings. “These movies weren’t sequels that looked the same as the last sequel in a long-running franchise. You might say people noticed.”
The blockbuster turnout signaled that Hollywood has finally bounced back from the pandemic. All told, North American multiplexes had their biggest weekend since “Avengers: Endgame” arrived in April 2019. “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” powered the domestic box office to about $302 million in total weekend ticket sales, with films such as “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” and “Sound of Freedom” contributing to the balance.
“Barbie,” a feminist manifesto wrapped in hot pink bubble gum, sold an estimated $155 million in tickets at domestic theaters, according to Comscore, which compiles box office data. The PG-13 comedy collected an additional $182 million overseas. “Barbie” was released by Warner Bros. and cost $145 million to make, not including marketing expenses, which were considerable.
Box office analysts, using complex formulas to forecast ticket sales, had expected “Barbie” to collect about $110 million in the United States and Canada. Worried that the movie might underperform expectations, as several big-budget releases have recently, including “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” Warner Bros. predicted a conservative $75 million.
It ended up as the biggest opening of Gerwig’s career, by a moonshot, cementing her status as one of Hollywood’s young “name” filmmakers — directors who mainstream ticket buyers recognize as delivering singular work. (Jordan Peele is another, along with more established cohorts such as Nolan and J.J. Abrams.) Gerwig, who wrote the comedic “Barbie” script with her partner, Noah Baumbach, previously directed “Little Women” (2019) and “Lady Bird” (2017). She has been nominated for three Oscars.
It was also the biggest opening on record for a female director, surpassing “Captain Marvel,” which was co-directed by Anna Boden and had $153.4 million in initial ticket sales in 2019.
“This is a record-shattering opening,” said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter on box office numbers. “No comedic film of any kind has opened higher than $85.9 million over a three-day weekend.”
“Barbie” arrived as a full-blown cultural event, with thousands of moviegoers draping themselves in pink for screenings, doll memes flooding social media and marketers scrambling (sometimes awkwardly) to glom onto the moment. The audience was 65% female. “For a film this pink, you would have expected the audience to be closer to 90% female — we got a ton of guys,” said Jeff Goldstein, president of domestic distribution at Warner Bros. “It exploded everywhere: large markets, small markets, coast to coast.”
Some theaters seemed to be caught off guard. One high-end theater in the Washington, D.C., suburbs went all out on promotion, with pink lights to highlight “Barbie” and a wall of movie posters featuring both films. But the theater may have miscalculated Saturday attendance. By the 10 p.m. showing, it had run out of multiple food items. It also lacked soft drinks and, amazingly, ice.
Another theater in Arlington, Virginia, had it worse: The air conditioning went out, leading to a sweltering experience. While the theater offered refunds, many ticket buyers stayed.
The question now is whether Hollywood can keep the momentum going. Studio executives have long pointed out that moviegoing begets moviegoing — that the habit of watching movies in theaters is crucial. Coming up, however, studios are facing another crisis: A strike by unionized actors, which started July 14, could force movie companies to push back coming films because striking stars cannot take part in publicity campaigns. “Challengers,” a sports drama involving a love triangle and starring Zendaya, has already been pushed from September to April.

Agreement Averts Strike on Broadway: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The agreement would cover a subset of workers, including about 1,500 stagehands, hairdressers and other crew members on Broadway and in touring productions.
The union representing a segment of Broadway crew members reached a tentative agreement for a new contract with theater owners just as its members were voting on whether to authorize a potential strike, the organizations announced Thursday.
The deal involved a subset of Broadway workers who are covered by what is known as the "pink contract," including roughly 1,500 stagehands, wardrobe personnel, makeup artists and hairdressers. A strike of those workers -- who are involved in 45 theatrical shows, including touring productions, and 28 shows on Broadway -- would have had the potential to shut down much of the industry, especially if other unionized theater workers joined in solidarity.
The tentative agreement was announced in a joint statement between the union, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, and the Broadway League, a trade association representing theater owners and producers. Disney Theatrical, which is behind shows such as "Aladdin" and "The Lion King," is also part of the deal. It covers crew members who carry a pink traveling card that shows that they're able to do union work in different jurisdictions.
"The strike has been averted," Jonas Loeb, a union spokesman, said in a statement, "though the contract must be approved by the membership."
Loeb said that the union has been negotiating about two months, including a marathon 19-hour session this week, and that one of the major sticking points was minimum payment rates for Broadway crew members.
A walkout by theater workers would have added to the labor unrest roiling the American entertainment industry, as Hollywood writers and actors continue their strikes.

Dancing Toward Their Big Debut: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: A teenage ritual takes on deeper significance as a setting where autistic young people can blossom -- and exercise their social skills along the way.
"How to Dance in Ohio," a poignant new musical about a group of young autistic adults gearing up for a spring dance, will open on Broadway late this year, with a cast of seven autistic performers playing the central roles.
The musical is based on a 2015 documentary from the filmmaker Alexandra Shiva that followed participants in a social skills therapy program for people on the autism spectrum; the musical is also set at a therapy program, and it tells the story of young adults preparing for a dance that they hope could help them confront some of the challenges they face in navigating social interactions.
The musical had a previous run last year at Syracuse Stage in central New York; the production schedule was cut short when Covid cases arose among the cast and crew. The review of the show in The Post-Standard, a Syracuse newspaper, was headlined "The musical you'll talk about for the rest of your life" and called it "exhilarating, groundbreaking, celebratory."
Casting is not yet complete, but will include several actors making their Broadway debuts: Desmond Edwards, Amelia Fei, Madison Kopec, Liam Pearce, Imani Russell, Conor Tague and Ashley Wool. Among the others on the bill so far are Haven Burton and Darlesia Cearcy.
"How to Dance in Ohio" features a book and lyrics by Rebekah Greer Melocik and music by Jacob Yandura; it is directed by Sammi Cannold and choreographed by Mayte Natalio. The famed director and producer Hal Prince was initially attached to the project; he died in 2019.
The musical is being produced by a company called P3 Productions, which is led by Ben Holtzman, Sammy Lopez and Fiona Howe Rudin, along with Level Forward, the production company co-founded by Abigail Disney. It is being capitalized for up to $ 15.5 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The show is to begin previews Nov. 15 and to open Dec. 10 at the Belasco Theater.

Full text: The eighth annual fan event will host a variety of discussions about how to diversify stages, songs and scripts. Here are six to look out for.
It's the most musical time of the year, the weekend when thousands of fans from around the world descend on Midtown Manhattan for costume contests, Playbill swaps and theater idol meet-and-greets.
This year's BroadwayCon, which takes place July 21-23 at the Marriott Marquis hotel, gives fans the chance to preview new Broadway shows like the "Back to the Future" musical and the "Jaws" comedy "The Shark Is Broken," catch up with original cast members from the not-exactly-family-friendly puppet musical "Avenue Q" and the storied rock opera "The Who's Tommy."
The schedule also features thoughtful panels, many focused on issues of representation on Broadway, such as a planned discussion on roles for disabled actors, featuring the "Cost of Living" Tony Award nominee Katy Sullivan.
Here are six you won't want to miss.
Celebrating Female and Nonbinary Voices
A group of female and nonbinary songwriters, among them Kristen Anderson-Lopez, the Oscar, Grammy and Emmy Award-winning co-writer of Disney's "Frozen" (both the film and Broadway musical) and "Remember Me" from Pixar's "Coco," will spotlight recent achievements by female, nonbinary and gender-expansive composers and lyricists and discuss how the industry might open more doors to them.
"Spotlight on Women and Nonbinary Musical Theater Writers," Friday, 10 a.m.
Diversifying Stages
A panel of playwrights, composers and actors of color will discuss how to bring more work to Broadway that represents perspectives from beyond white American culture. Among them will be Jordan E. Cooper, who was recently nominated for two Tonys for writing and starring in the biting race comedy "Ain't No Mo"' on Broadway; Helen Park, the first Asian female composer on Broadway, who earned a Tony nomination for "KPOP"; and Kristoffer Diaz, whose new musical, "Hell's Kitchen," written with the singer Alicia Keys, is slated to open at the Public Theater in November.
"What Is the Future of Broadway? A Dream Session with Global Majority Playwrights and Musical Theater Writers," Friday, 11:15 a.m.
Restaging Problematic Classics
A panel of directors, writers and producers will discuss how to revive musicals like "Miss Saigon," "South Pacific" and "The King and I" with troublesome structural or political elements (or both). Participants will include Lear deBessonet, the artistic director of Encores!, a longstanding, popular New York City Center series that stages short-run productions of decades-old musicals, and Schele Williams, who is directing the upcoming Broadway revival of "The Wiz."
"That Wouldn't Fly Today: The Art of Revising Revivals," Friday, 3:45 p.m.
Discussing Disability on Broadway
Performers with disabilities have become a more common sight on Broadway stages lately, appearing in productions including "Cost of Living," "A Doll's House" and "Grey House." For Katy Sullivan, who was recently nominated for a Tony for her performance in "Cost of Living" as the feisty wheelchair user Ani, it's not just the presence of disabled actors in recent productions that is encouraging -- it's the types of roles they're being cast in.
"I would love to see a world where even more performers with disabilities are utilized within characters who aren't necessarily written as disabled," Sullivan said. The panel also includes Gregg Mozgala, her "Cost of Living" co-star; Madison Ferris, who became the first wheelchair user to play a lead role on Broadway when she starred in a 2017 revival of "The Glass Menagerie" opposite Sally Field; and David Connolly, who became the first amputee to perform on Broadway in a 1989 revival of the Civil War musical "Shenandoah."
"Ready, Willing and Very Abled," Saturday, 3:45 p.m.
Applauding Asian American Stories
The New York theater landscape has changed radically since Ali Ewoldt made her Broadway debut as Cosette in a revival of "Les Misérables" in 2006.
"We for a long time had a very homogeneous way of telling stories," said Ewoldt, who in 2016 became the first Asian American actress to play Christine in "The Phantom of the Opera" on Broadway. "So it's exciting to me when Broadway and theater and TV reflect the world we live in, in all its complexity and diversity."
She and five actors of Asian American and Pacific Islander descent -- among them Zachary Noah Piser, who in 2019 became the first Asian American actor to play Evan Hansen on Broadway -- will celebrate recent representation in shows like "Here Lies Love," "Camelot" and "Life of Pi" and discuss how to see even more of their communities' stories portrayed onstage.
"Telling Our Stories -- Breaking the A.A.P.I. Box on Broadway," Sunday, 11:15 a.m.
Building a Latino Future
Six songwriters, playwrights, directors and actors, including Luis Salgado from "In the Heights" and the playwright Christin Eve Cato, will discuss the importance of creating, sharing and producing Latino-written works of musical theater, as well as the challenges they faced on their journeys to Broadway and the strategies that helped them break through.
"El Futuro es Latiné: Dreaming of A More Diverse Theater Industry," Sunday, 11:15 a.m.

Upbeat Earnings for Netflix Amid Backdrop of Strikes: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The streaming company's performance has been helped by its crackdown on password sharing and a relatively new advertising tier introduced last year.
Netflix added millions of subscribers in the second quarter and saw a rise in revenue, the company said on Wednesday in an upbeat earnings report that came at a moment when the entertainment industry is dealing with dual strikes inspired in part by the economics of streaming.
Netflix added 5.9 million subscribers to bring its global total to 238 million. Its revenue rose 3 percent, to $ 8.2 billion, from the same period last year, and the company also said it had $ 1.5 billion in profit in the quarter, a similar number to last year at this time.
The results were attributed to two policies that were introduced last year after Netflix's first reported subscriber loss in 10 years: a crackdown on password sharing and a relatively new advertising tier.
The company said there had been scant resistance to its password sharing crackdown. It noted that revenue in each region in which its service was available was now higher than before the sharing restrictions were enforced and that new subscriptions already exceeded cancellations.
The new advertising tier that Netflix introduced in November is still a small component of the company's business, but Netflix said it believed it would continue to grow. Membership numbers for its ad-supported tier have doubled since the first quarter.
"While we've made steady progress this year, we have more work to do to re-accelerate our growth," the company wrote in its letter to shareholders. "We remain focused on: creating a steady drumbeat of must-watch shows and movies; improving monetization; growing the enjoyment of our games; and investing to improve our service for members."
Comcast, Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount Global and Disney will all report earnings in the coming weeks. But the optics for Netflix are especially complicated. Netflix has been on the receiving end of much of the vitriol surrounding the strike, primarily from writers who say the economics of the streaming era have eroded their working conditions and hurt their overall compensation. The company already contended with angry shareholders last month, when they voted to reject lucrative pay packages for the company's top executives.
Netflix had little to say about the strikes, beyond noting that it had lowered the overall amount of cash it was planning to spend on content this year because of "timing of production starts and the ongoing W.G.A. and SAG-AFTRA strikes," referring to the writers' and actors' unions. It acknowledged that its free cash flow expectations from 2023 to 2024 could "create some lumpiness" because there was no guarantee when the production of films and series would begin again.
Unlike traditional entertainment companies, which have seen their stock prices drop since the writers' strike began in May, Netflix shares had increased roughly 50 percent. But they dropped about 9 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday, perhaps prompted by lower-than-expected projections for revenue and sales.
During an investor conference call, Netflix's co-chief executive, Ted Sarandos, did not directly answer how long the strikes could go on before the streaming service would run out of new content.
"We make deals all the time; we are constantly at the table negotiating with actors and producers and everyone in the industry," Mr. Sarandos said. "We very much hoped to reach an agreement by now," he continued, adding that he grew up in a union household.
Mr. Sarandos's father was an electrician, he said, and he recalled how difficult it was for his family when his father was on strike.
Some of Netflix's productions were able to finish before the start of the actors' strike, which began last week. Other notable series like "Big Mouth," "Cobra Kai" and "Stranger Things" were all scheduled to be in production but were shut down because of unfinished scripts. In the case of "Stranger Things," the creators of the series, Matt and Ross Duffer, chose to stop filming because they could not continue write while on set.
"Writing does not stop when filming begins," they wrote on Twitter in early May.
The company has already seen some benefits from the strike. Last month, Netflix reported it would be licensing original HBO shows from WarnerMedia, including "Insecure," "Band of Brothers," "The Pacific," "Six Feet Under" and "Ballers."
With subscriber numbers on the rise and profits holding steady, analysts expressed enthusiasm about the changes Netflix has made to its business.
"Netflix's quarterly results demonstrated that the streaming company has a clear path to accelerate growth in both revenue and profit, and they're executing it well," Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com, wrote in a report. He did caution that maintaining the pace of growth would be challenging in the face of "the saturation of the streaming industry and the variety of different options available, and the fact that the pricing is not necessarily significantly below the competition."
Also concerning to some analysts is the fact that the short-term gains the company is likely to achieve because of the strikes could become a problem should they drag on. "Long-term though, the strikes could create a scenario of massive churn and lower ad revenue for streaming companies," said Scott Purdy, the U.S. national media industry leader at KPMG.
But others are optimistic about Netflix's advertising business, which is still in its early stages.
"They have everything that advertisers want," Jessica Reif Ehrlich, a Bank of America analyst, said. "They have reach, they have scale, they have premium video content. They've been very creative and have come up with some very innovative offerings, like offering advertisers to be in the top 10 weekly shows. So it's almost guaranteed reach."
Netflix also announced Wednesday that it had removed its $ 9.99 advertising-free "basic" plan in the United States and Britain. Consumers who subscribe to this plan can keep it, but new subscribers will have to choose either the ad-supported plan for $ 6.99 a month, or one of two ad-free options that cost either $ 15.49 or $ 19.99 a month.

Actors and Studios Remain 'Far Apart' on Major Issues: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The actors' union and the organization that bargains on behalf of the studios traded statements underscoring how much work needs to be done to reach an agreement.
As tens of thousands of actors go into their fifth day of a strike versus the Hollywood studios, the two sides have shown no signs of returning to the bargaining table -- and are even exchanging barbed messages that underscore how far apart they are.
Late Monday, leadership of SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union, sent members a 12-page memo laying out its demands and the studios' counterproposals. They "remain far apart on the most critical issues that affect the very survival of our profession," the note said.
"We marched ahead because they intentionally dragged their feet," it continued.
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the organization that bargains on behalf of the studios, answered with a note to the news media arguing that the message from the union "deliberately distorts" the offers it had made.
"A strike is not the outcome we wanted," the alliance said. "For SAG-AFTRA to assert that we have not been responsive to the needs of its membership is disingenuous at best."
Thousands of Hollywood actors went on strike on Friday after failing to reach a new contract with the major studios, including old-line companies like Paramount, Universal and Disney and tech giants like Netflix, Amazon and Apple.
The actors joined 11,500 screenwriters who went on strike 78 days ago, the first time both unions had walked out at the same time since 1960. The writers have not returned to the bargaining table with the studios since their negotiations collapsed in early May.
SAG-AFTRA's note said the two sides remained far apart on several key issues, including compensation, guardrails against artificial intelligence, and health care and pension costs.
The union's leadership said it had asked for 11 percent wage increases in the first year of a new contract; the studios came back with an offer of 5 percent, the union said.
When it comes to artificial intelligence, the union's leaders said they had argued for a number of provisions to protect them "when a 'digital replica' is made or our performance is changed using A.I."
They said the studio alliance "failed to address many vital concerns, leaving principal performers and background actors vulnerable to having most of their work replaced by digital replicas."
The studios said that the union's note to its members "fails to include the proposals offered verbally" during negotiations, and that its overall package was worth more than $ 1 billion in wage increases, improvements on residuals (a type of royalty) and health care contributions.
Regarding artificial intelligence, the studios said they had offered a "groundbreaking proposal, which protects performers' digital likenesses, including a requirement for performer's consent for the creation and use of digital replicas or for digital alterations of a performance."
Union leadership sent out a chart laying out each proposal and the studios' response. Over more than two dozen proposals, the studio response amounted to one word, according to the union: "Rejected."
"So who's making the T-Shirt that says 'Rejected'?" the actress Senta Moses posted on Twitter.
"This is why we're on strike," the union note said. "The A.M.P.T.P. thinks we will relent, but the will of our membership has never been stronger. We have the resolve and unity needed to defend our rights."

Loyalty and Morphing in the Marvel Universe: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: In an interview, the Australian actor discusses his character's big moment in the most recent episode and his role as ally to Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury.
This article includes spoilers for the fourth episode of "Secret Invasion."
At one point while on set for the latest Marvel TV show "Secret Invasion," Ben Mendelsohn and Samuel L. Jackson broke into song.
They had both taken a break from filming to listen to some tunes, and when "Poison Ivy" by the Coasters came on they began belting out the lyrics.
"I'll get the occasional word wrong, but Sam's all over it," Ben Mendelsohn, 54, said in an interview last week.
It's Mendelsohn's interactions with Jackson onscreen -- their two characters squabble like decades-long lovers as they attempt to stave off World War III -- that energize this latest installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Jackson's character, the grizzled superspy Nick Fury, has been around since before Tony Stark was Iron Man. In "Secret Invasion," streaming on Disney+, he's back to his old pastime of saving planet Earth -- this time from an invasion of shape-shifting aliens called Skrulls -- but after a hiatus in space, he seems slightly off kilter, slower and less formidable.
And so it is Mendelsohn's character Talos, a Skrull general, who steps in to help -- just as he's been doing for decades, as he reminds Fury: "Your life got a hell of a lot more charmed once I came into it." It thus feels fitting, though no less upsetting for fans, that Episode 4 ends with Talos sacrificing his life to help Fury complete one more mission.
This is Mendelsohn's third appearance in a Marvel production, after his character's introduction in "Captain Marvel" and a brief cameo in "Spider-Man: Far From Home." Now, the Australian actor is relishing the chance to be part of a show full of what he calls "old-fashioned Cold War thriller stuff."
Mendelsohn gained recognition in the United States for his role in the Australian crime drama film "Animal Kingdom," and he later starred in the Netflix show "Bloodline," which premiered in 2015. Born in Melbourne, he first got into acting by starring in school plays and memorizing every line from the movie, "Taxi Driver."
"Once I got bitten by that bug, I didn't look back," he said.
Not long after the premiere of last week's pivotal episode, Mendelsohn spoke about his role, his character's relationship with Nick Fury and whether Talos is truly dead. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
So far Marvel's TV series have taken different forms and explored a variety of issues. What are some of the key themes of this one?
I think there is a lot to do with trust and secrecy. I think there's a certain theme of mutability. You could take that on the obvious level with the whole Skrull-y thing, but I also think it's about the mutability of where someone is in their life. When I think about the show I think about it through the Nick Fury lens. I've always looked at it very much as Sam's piece. One of the real delights for me is that this relationship morphed between these two characters, which was not there from Day Zero. What I really love is how different Fury is, how different the world is post Infinity Gauntlet and what that does to loyalty. Because loyalty without stress or duress doesn't mean anything.
How has the relationship between Talos and Fury evolved, starting from "Captain Marvel"? At one point, Talos was impersonating Fury, right?
Yeah that was such a genius flip from Marvel to have Fury [in "Spider-Man: Far From Home"] be Talos the entire time. Ostensibly the two characters start out as enemies. And what we come to learn is how incredibly loyal Talos is to Fury. What we learn is that Fury owes his entire je ne sais quoi to these creatures. And if you want to think about how deeply Marvel can flip stuff on its head, they've taken what were the surf Nazi punks of the Marvel world and turned them into the incredibly effective ally of the humans.
Do you think Talos is too optimistic about the humans and the Skrull coexisting?
If you keep boiling the argument down, Talos's argument is really the only one that stands. Because if you take the Gravik (Kingsley Ben-Adir) kind of perspective and you go for domination, there is one thing that Talos correctly surmises: You will not beat them. It's their spot, and they have already shown that they can be incredibly effective at wiping out enormous numbers of beings. And so while you can look at what G'iah (Emilia Clarke) is going through and understand Gravik's frustration, it's similar to the frustrations that we've seen play out locally elsewhere. And you might well say, "OK, yeah that's right. Go for it and go for it now." But it's reckless, destructive. And it's immature both ideologically and in a realpolitik sense. So as idealistic as Talos may appear to be, he is really the only one with the genuine experience and genuine ability to call it. This is not a zero-sum game for humans and Skrull.
Given how this episode started, with the big reveal about G'iah's still being alive, is Talos really dead? Should we expect some kind of regeneration later on?
Well to answer that would be to be an enemy of what I do. My greatest loyalty is always to the audience, and I try not to undermine that in any way, shape, or form. But I can definitely tell you Talos's death is a turning point.
What has it been like to interact with Jackson both on-set and off?
The best things that were brought to this relationship onscreen were brought by Sam. Sam's the reason for the Skrull kiss at the very first time we see them together. It's Sam who really brings the template in the train scene that allows me to react off and against them. Sam and I have been able to work together because we don't take it too seriously. But we also try not to half-step. And the reason I look through the lens of Sam a.k.a. Nick Fury is because I come at it as a guy who watched "Jungle Fever" and just went crazy.
I think a lot of fans are wondering: What's the significance of the Skrull in the overarching narrative arc of the MCU?
Ever since they've been introduced and utilized well, they do present an ever-present threat. Because how do you know? That's one of the great things about "Secret Invasion." "Civil War" also has that flavor. It's just like, Who is who here?
The great strength of the studio is that they play what-if for real; they don't play what-if as an entertaining byline. They play it for real and keep integrating it. Once they have an event for "Secret Invasion," you can't un-have it.
While I was watching the show there was a point where I wondered if Fury was going to change into a Skrull halfway through?
Well, keep watching. Fury is more connected to the Skrull than any other human is.

The Red Berets Are Out: U.S. Tourists Stream Back to France: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Prices are high, but Americans are opening their wallets for international flights and hotels. It's the latest evidence of consumer resilience.
Forget Emily. These days, a whole flood of Americans are in Paris.
People spent 2020 and 2021 either cooped up at home or traveling sparingly and mostly within the continental U.S. But after Covid travel restrictions were lifted for international trips last summer, Americans are again headed overseas.
While domestic leisure travel shows signs of calming -- people are still vacationing in big numbers, but prices for hotels and flights are moderating as demand proves strong but not insatiable -- foreign trips are snapping back with a vengeance. Americans are boarding planes and cruise ships to flock to Europe in particular, based on early data.
According to estimates from AAA, international travel bookings for 2023 were up 40 percent from 2022 through May. That is still down about 2 percent from 2019, but it's a hefty surge at a time when some travelers are being held back by long passport processing delays amid record-high applications. Tour and cruise bookings are expected to eclipse prepandemic highs, with especially strong demand for vacations to major European cities.
Paris, for example, experienced a huge jump in North American tourists last year compared with 2021, according to the city's tourism bureau. Planned air arrivals for July and August of this year climbed by another 14.4 percent -- to nearly 5 percent above the 2019 level.
"This year is just completely crazy," said Steeve Calvo, a Parisian tour guide and sommelier whose company -- The Americans in Paris -- has been churning out visits to Normandy and French wine regions. He attributes some of the jump to a rebound from the pandemic and some to television shows and social media.
"'Emily in Paris': I never saw so many people in Paris with red berets," he said, noting that the signature chapeau of the popular Netflix show's heroine started to pop up on tourists last year. Other newcomers are eager to take coveted photos for their Instagram pages.
"In Versailles, the Hall of Mirrors, I call it the Hall of Selfie," Mr. Calvo said, referring to a famous room in the palace.
Robust travel booking numbers and anecdotes from tour guides align with what companies say they are experiencing: From airlines to American Express, corporate executives are reporting a lasting demand for flights and vacations.
"The constructive industry backdrop is unlike anything that any of us have ever seen," Ed Bastian, the chief executive officer at Delta Air Lines, said during a June 27 investor day. "Travel is going gangbusters, but it's going to continue to go gangbusters because we still have an enormous amount of demand waiting."
Transportation Security Administration data shows that the daily average number of passengers who passed through U.S. airport checkpoints in June 2023 was 2.6 million, 0.5 percent above the June 2019 level, based on an analysis by Omair Sharif at Inflation Insights.
And in many foreign airports, the burst of American vacationers is palpable: Customs lines are packed with U.S. tourists, from Paris's Charles de Gaulle to London's Heathrow. The latter saw 8 percent more traffic from North America in June 2023 than in June 2019, based on airport data.
In a weird way, the rebound in foreign travel may be taking some pressure off U.S. inflation.
International flight prices, while surging for some routes, are not a big part of the U.S. Consumer Price Index, which is dominated by domestic flight prices. In fact, airfares in the inflation measure dropped sharply in June from the previous month and are down nearly 19 percent from a year ago.
That is partly because fuel is cheaper and partly because airlines are getting more planes into the sky. Many pilots and air traffic controllers had been laid off or had retired, so companies struggled to keep up when demand started to recover after the initial pandemic slump, pushing prices sharply higher in 2022.
"We just didn't have enough seats to go around last year," Mr. Sharif said, explaining that while personnel issues persist, so far this year the supply situation has been better. "Planes are still totally packed, but there are more planes."
And as people flock abroad, it is sapping some demand from hotels and tourist attractions in the United States. International tourists have yet to return to the United States in full force, so they are not entirely offsetting the wave of Americans headed overseas.
Domestic travel is hardly in a free fall -- July 4 weekend travel probably set new records, per AAA -- but tourists are no longer so insatiable that hotels can keep raising room rates indefinitely. Prices for lodging away from home in the U.S. climbed by 4.5 percent in the year through June, which is far slower than the 25 percent annual increases hotel rooms were posting last spring. There is even elbow room at Disney World.
Even if it isn't inflationary, the jump in foreign travel does highlight something about the U.S. economy: It's hard to keep U.S. consumers down, especially affluent ones.
The Fed has been raising interest rates to cool growth since early 2022. Officials have made it more expensive to borrow money in hopes of creating a ripple effect that would cut into demand and force companies to stop lifting prices so much.
Consumption has slowed amid that onslaught, but it hasn't tanked. Fed officials have taken note, remarking at their last meeting that consumption had been "stronger than expected," minutes showed.
The resilience comes as many households remain in solid financial shape. People who travel internationally skew wealthier, and many are benefiting from a rising stock market and still-high home prices that are beginning to prove surprisingly immune to interest rate moves.
Those who do not have big stock or real estate holdings are experiencing a strong job market, and some are still holding onto extra savings built up during the pandemic. And it is not just vacation destinations feeling the momentum: Consumers are still spending on a range of other services.
"There's this last blowoff of spending," said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist for the insurance company Nationwide Mutual.
It could be that consumer resilience will help the U.S. economy avoid a recession as the Fed fights inflation. As has been the case at American hotels, demand that stabilizes without plummeting could allow for a slow and steady moderation of price increases.
But if consumers remain so ravenous that companies find they can still charge more, it could prolong inflation. That's why the Fed is keeping a close eye on spending.
Ms. Bostjancic thinks consumers will pull back starting this fall. They are drawing down their savings, the labor market is cooling, and it may simply take time for the Fed's rate increases to have their full effect.
But when it comes to many types of travel, there is no end in sight yet.
"Despite economic headwinds, we're seeing very strong demand for summer leisure travel," said Mike Daher, who leads the U.S. Transportation, Hospitality & Services practice at the consulting firm Deloitte.
Mr. Daher attributes that to three driving forces. People missed trips. Social media is luring many to new places. And the advent of remote work is allowing professionals -- "what we call the laptop luggers," per Mr. Daher -- to stretch out vacations by working a few days from the beach or the mountains.
Mr. Calvo, the tour guide, is riding the wave, taking Americans on tours that showcase Paris's shared history with France and driving them in minivan tours to Champagne.
"I have no clue if it's going to last," he said.

Sally Kempton, 80, Rising Journalism Star Turned Swami, Is Dead: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: She was making her name in New York journalism in the footsteps of her famous father and becoming an outspoken feminist when she met an Indian guru.
Sally Kempton, who was once a rising star in the New York journalism world and a fierce exponent of radical feminism, but who later pivoted to a life of Eastern asceticism and spiritual practice, died on Monday at her home in Carmel, Calif. She was 80.
Her brother David Kempton said the cause was heart failure, adding that she had suffered from a chronic lung condition.
Ms. Kempton's literary pedigree was impeccable. Her father was Murray Kempton, the erudite and acerbic newspaper columnist and a lion of New York journalism, the ranks of which she joined in the late 1960s as a staff writer for The Village Voice and a contributor to The New York Times. She was a sharp and talented reporter -- although she sometimes felt she hadn't properly earned her place as a journalist and owed it largely to her father's reputation.
She wrote arch pieces about New Age fads like astrology: "One believes in marijuana and Bob Dylan," she noted in The Times in 1969, and "astrology is part of an atmosphere which includes these things and others; it is one of the ways we speak to our friends." She profiled rock stars like Frank Zappa and reviewed books for The Times.
She and a friend, the author Susan Brownmiller, joined a group called the New York Radical Feminists, and in the spring of 1970 they participated in a sit-in at the offices of Ladies' Home Journal to protest its editorial content, which they said was demeaning to women. That same month, she and Ms. Brownmiller were invited on "The Dick Cavett Show" to represent what was then called the women's liberation movement; the two had a set-to with Hugh Hefner, the publisher of Playboy magazine, who was also a guest, as was the rock singer Grace Slick (who did not seem totally on board with the feminist agenda).
But what made Ms. Kempton famous, for a New York minute, was a blistering essay in the July 1970 issue of Esquire magazine called "Cutting Loose," in which she took aim at her father, her husband and her own complicity in the regressive gender roles of the era.
The basic point of the essay was that she had been groomed to be a certain kind of bright but compliant helpmeet, and she was spitting mad at herself for succeeding. Her father, she wrote, considered women to be incapable of serious thought and was skilled in the art of putting women down; their own relationship, she said, was like that of an 18th-century count and his precocious daughter, "in which she grows up to be the perfect feminine companion, parroting him with such subtlety that it is impossible to tell her thoughts and feelings, so coincident with his, are not original."
She described her husband, the movie producer Harrison Starr, who was 13 years her senior, as "a male supremacist in the style of Norman Mailer" who infantilized her and provoked in her such frustration that she fantasized about bashing him in the head with a frying pan.
"It is hard to fight an enemy," she concluded, "who has outposts in your head."
The piece landed like a cluster bomb. Her marriage did not survive. Her relationship with her father suffered. Women devoured it, recognizing themselves in her furious prose. To a certain generation, it is still a touchstone of feminist exposition. Years later, Susan Cheever, writing in The Times, called it "a scream of marital rage."
Four years after the Esquire piece was published, Ms. Kempton essentially vanished, to follow an Indian mystic named Swami Muktananda, otherwise known as Baba, a proponent of a spiritual practice known as Siddha Yoga. Baba was touring America in the 1970s and accruing devotees from the chattering classes by the hundreds and then the thousands -- including, at one point, seemingly half of Hollywood.
By 1982, Ms. Kempton had taken a vow of chastity and poverty to live as a monk in Baba's ashrams, first in India and then in a former borscht belt hotel in the Catskills. He gave her the name Swami Durgananda, and she donned the traditional orange robes of a Hindu monk.
After she was ordained, as she told the writer Sara Davidson, who profiled Ms. Kempton in 2001, she ran into a Sarah Lawrence classmate, who then wrote in the alumni newsletter, "Saw Sally Kempton, '64, who is now married to an Indian man and is Mrs. Durgananda."
As The Oakland Tribune reported in 1983, "The Sally Kempton who had written about sexual rage in Esquire no longer existed."
Sally Kempton was born on Jan. 15, 1943, in Manhattan and grew up in Princeton, N.J., the eldest of five children. Her mother, Mina (Bluethenthal) Kempton, was a social worker; she and Mr. Kempton divorced when Sally was in college.
She attended Sarah Lawrence instead of Barnard, she wrote in her Esquire essay, because her boyfriend at the time thought it was a more "feminine" institution. There, she co-edited a magazine parody called The Establishment. She was hired by The Village Voice right after graduation and began writing pieces, as she put it, about "drugs and hippies" that she said were mostly made up because she had no idea what she was doing. (Her writing belied that assertion.)
She had her first ecstatic experience, she later recalled, in her apartment in the West Village, while taking psychedelics with a boyfriend and listening to the Grateful Dead song "Ripple."
"All the complexities and the suffering and the pain and the mental stuff I was concerned with as a downtown New York journalist just dissolved, and all I could see was love," she said in a video on her website. When she described her new insight to her boyfriend, she said, he responded by asking, "Haven't you ever taken acid before?"
But Ms. Kempton had had a transformative experience, and she continued to have them as she began investigating spiritual practices like yoga and Tibetan Buddhism. She went to see Baba out of curiosity -- everyone was doing it -- and, as she wrote in 1976 in New York magazine, if you're going to get yourself a guru, why not get a good one?
She was instantly pulled in, she wrote, charmed by his matter-of-fact persona as well as something more potent, if hard to define. Before long she had joined his entourage. It felt, she said, like running away with the circus.
Her friends were appalled. "But you were always so ambitious," one said. "I'm still ambitious," she said. "There's just been a slight shift in direction."
Ms. Kempton spent nearly 30 years with Baba's organization, known as the SYDA Foundation, for two decades of which she was a swami. Baba died in 1982, following accusations that he had sexually abused young women in his ashrams; since his death, the foundation has been run by his successor, Gurumayi Chidvilasananda. In 1994, when Lis Harris, a writer for The New Yorker, investigated the foundation and wrote an article that noted the accusations against Baba and questions about his succession, she quoted Ms. Kempton as saying that the accusations were "ridiculous." Ms. Kempton never spoke publicly about the issue.
In 2002, she put away her robes and left the ashram, moving to Carmel to teach meditation and spiritual philosophy. She was the author of a number of books on spiritual practices, including "Meditation for the Love of It: Enjoying Your Own Deepest Experience" (2011), which has an introduction by Elizabeth Gilbert of "Eat, Pray Love" fame.
In addition to her brother David, Ms. Kempton is survived by two other brothers, Arthur and Christopher. Another brother, James Murray Kempton Jr., known as Mike, was killed in a car crash with his wife, Jean Goldschmidt Kempton, a college friend of Sally's, in 1971.
Ms. Kempton's father, after his initial shock, was supportive of her new life. He was a spiritual man himself, a practicing Episcopalian, but humble about it. "I just go for the music," he liked to tell people.
Murray Kempton, who died in 1997, visited the ashram and met with Baba a number of times, David Kempton said, and was respectful of the order's ethos and history. He told The Oakland Tribune that if his daughter had wanted to be a druid he might have worried.
"I assume she knows something that I don't know," he said. "I respect her choice. In fact, I admire the choice Sally made. After all, she is a swami, isn't she?"

Los Angeles Faces Blows To Economy And Hearts: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Los Angeles County has 88 cities. Ten million people. Two hundred-plus languages spoken.
And a nine-letter sign that, for much of the world, defines the entire region: HOLLYWOOD.
Los Angeles has long been regarded as the global "company town" for show business, and as a rare actors' strike upended the signature industry this week, the potential for cascading economic impacts across Southern California has emerged as a critical local issue. But economists disagree on just how extensively the simultaneous actors' and writers' strikes will be felt.
Even by the most generous estimates, Hollywood has never supported more than about 5 percent of employment in a region where many more people work in trade, health care, government and even Southern California's diminished manufacturing sector. Yet Hollywood pervades Los Angeles life in ways as big as a movie backdrop or as small as a street detour on some awards night.
For many, the ceased productions and darkened premieres are not just a threat to the flow of dollars to restaurants and retailers that cater to film crews, but also a blow to the region's cultural heart.
"To the extent that Hollywood defines America's idea of where I live, Hollywood's troubles become my troubles," said D.J. Waldie, a cultural historian in Southern California. "When Hollywood stops, a great many things stop here, and not just a few studios."
During the 2007 screenwriters' strike, the California economy lost $ 2.1 billion, according to one study. The last time unionized screenwriters and actors staged dual walkouts, in 1960, the strikes did not settle for nearly six months.
Economists on Friday said the length of the two strikes will largely determine its financial impact on Los Angeles, though some were more optimistic than others.
Lee Ohanian, an economics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has written extensively about California, estimated that about 20 percent of the local economy could be hit, in part because the industry generates so much revenue and has so many highly compensated local employees.
Chris Thornberg, a founding partner at the Los Angeles consulting firm Beacon Economics, said the strikes might not be felt locally for a long time because so much of show business has been focused on exploiting and distributing existing content.
"As long as people are paying for Hulu and buying Disney movies online, we're making money," Dr. Thornberg said. "Eventually, there will come a time when the lack of content will start to pinch, but this is a slow boil, not a rapid one."
The mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, made it clear that she considered the labor standoff to be an urgent local issue and called on the studios and unions to "work around the clock" to reach an equitable agreement.
"This affects all of us and is essential to our overall economy," Mayor Bass said.
Less tangible is the potential impact on Southern California's self image. Show business is wrapped up in the region's civic identity in ways that are unparalleled in less-renowned cities.
An audience of 18.7 million people this year tuned in to the Academy Awards, Los Angeles' best known office party. Backdrops from Venice Beach to the Sixth Street Viaduct are regarded locally with pride as stars in their own right. Homeowners from the San Fernando Valley to South Pasadena run lucrative side hustles, renting their houses for film shoots and ads.
Though most of the famous names live in mansions behind gates, few Angelenos, even in far-flung exurbs, are without a celebrity story -- the producer spotted in Joshua Tree, the famous face in the next lane in traffic.
"Everywhere I go, people ask me the same question: What stars have I met?" said Stephen Cheung, the president and chief executive of the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation. "Nobody would ask me that if I were from another city."
Born in Hong Kong, Mr. Cheung, 44, said that he saw his first real celebrity in Los Angeles when he was about 10, through a car window. "We were near the convention center in downtown, and all of a sudden, a car pulled up and I saw Madonna get out."
Many also know stars the way anyone knows anyone in the nation's second-largest city: as neighbors or fellow parents or people walking their dogs. Entertainers sponsor local schools, embark on second careers as politicians, stump for state ballot initiatives and occasionally get into scrapes with the mayor for trying to fill their own potholes.
Democratic leaders throughout the liberal state have long been supportive; earlier this month, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California extended a $ 330 million-a-year film and television tax credit program to encourage studios to keep productions at home.
Certain communities share a special bond.
"We have a lot of studio people who live in Burbank," Mimi House, a retired medical clinic administrative worker, said on Thursday while lunching with a group of fellow retirees in the Los Angeles suburb's "beautiful downtown" shortly after leaders of the actors' union, known as SAG-AFTRA, announced the walkout.
Without the entertainment industry, Burbank would be a "ghost town," added Virginia Bohr, a retired accountant at the table with Ms. House. Local officials recently renamed their airport Hollywood Burbank, though Hollywood is technically a neighborhood in Los Angeles, a separate city.
The region has long attracted show business aspirants from around the world who hope to catch their big break. Many scrape by for years before they find work outside the entertainment industry.
Thomas Whaley, a veteran teacher who for 23 years has coordinated an extensive visual and performing arts curriculum at the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District, credited the entertainment community for drawing him to the region and helping to ensure the longstanding success of his program, which has become a statewide model for the breadth and quality of its offerings. Were it not for the local concentration of talent, he said, he might never have ended up in the job he has come to cherish.
"I moved to L.A. to play trombone for film and TV in 1990," said Mr. Whaley, who grew up in Rhode Island and studied to become a studio musician on full scholarships at Berklee College of Music in Boston and the University of Miami. "My mother kept saying, Come home, Rhode Island's great, and I was like, Mom, they don't have what I need."
Other Angelenos feel a disconnect with an industry whose workers have long been concentrated in parts of the city that are more affluent and white.
In Mid-City, a Los Angeles neighborhood several miles south of Hollywood that is predominantly Latino and Black, Rachel Johnson and Rosario Gomez, both 17, were more interested in frozen fruit treats from the local paleta shop than in the demands of Hollywood strikers.
"It's the least of our concerns," Ms. Johnson said of the picket lines, noting the struggling mom-and-pop businesses on their streets, rising rents and persistent homeless encampments.
"Yeah, there are bigger problems here, like gentrification," Ms. Gomez added.
Nearby at La Cevicheria, a tiny eatery on Pico Boulevard, Yejoo Kim, 29, who works in geopolitics, agreed that Hollywood "can feel worlds apart," even for Angelenos who were born and raised in the city, as she was.
But she and her roommate, David Choi, 27, also pointed to the large immigrant communities in Los Angeles that have been reflected with care in recent years in film and television.
"I feel a sense of solidarity," said Mr. Choi, a novelist interested in the pay standards that Hollywood sets for its writers. "I'd be happy to participate in a boycott of a show."

America’s Foreign Vacations Tell Us Something About the U.S. Economy

PARIS — Forget Emily. These days, a whole flood of Americans are in Paris.
People spent 2020 and 2021 either cooped up at home or traveling sparingly and mostly within the continental U.S. But after COVID-19 travel restrictions were lifted for international trips last summer, Americans are again headed overseas.
Although domestic leisure travel shows signs of calming — people are still vacationing in big numbers, but prices for hotels and flights are moderating as demand proves strong but not insatiable — foreign trips are snapping back with a vengeance. Americans are boarding planes and cruise ships to flock to Europe in particular, based on early data.
According to estimates from AAA, international travel bookings for 2023 were up 40% from 2022 through May. That is still down about 2% from 2019, but it’s a hefty surge at a time when some travelers are being held back by long passport-processing delays amid record-high applications. Tour and cruise bookings are expected to eclipse pre-pandemic highs, with especially strong demand for vacations to major European cities.
Paris, for example, experienced a huge jump in North American tourists last year compared with 2021, according to the city’s tourism bureau. Planned air arrivals for July and August of this year climbed by another 14.4% — to nearly 5% above the 2019 level.
“This year is just completely crazy,” said Steeve Calvo, a Parisian tour guide and sommelier whose company — The Americans in Paris — has been churning out visits to Normandy and French wine regions. He attributes some of the jump to a rebound from the pandemic and some to television shows and social media.
“‘Emily in Paris’: I never saw so many people in Paris with red berets,” he said, noting that the signature chapeau of the popular Netflix show’s heroine started to pop up on tourists last year. Other newcomers are eager to take coveted photos for their Instagram pages.
“In Versailles, the Hall of Mirrors, I call it the Hall of Selfie,” Calvo said, referring to a famous room in the palace.
Robust travel booking numbers and anecdotes from tour guides align with what companies say they are experiencing: From airlines to American Express, corporate executives are reporting a lasting demand for flights and vacations.
“The constructive industry backdrop is unlike anything that any of us have ever seen,” Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said during a June 27 investor day. “Travel is going gangbusters, but it’s going to continue to go gangbusters because we still have an enormous amount of demand waiting.”
Transportation Security Administration data shows that the daily average number of passengers who passed through U.S. airport checkpoints last month was 2.6 million, 0.5% above the June 2019 level, based on an analysis by Omair Sharif at Inflation Insights.
And in many foreign airports, the burst of American vacationers is palpable: Customs lines are packed with U.S. tourists, from Paris’ Charles de Gaulle to London’s Heathrow. The latter saw 8% more traffic from North America last month than in June 2019, based on airport data.
In a weird way, the rebound in foreign travel may be taking some pressure off U.S. inflation.
International flight prices, while surging for some routes, are not a big part of the U.S. consumer price index, which is dominated by domestic flight prices. In fact, airfares in the inflation measure dropped sharply in June from the previous month and are down nearly 19% from a year ago.
That is partly because fuel is cheaper and partly because airlines are getting more planes into the sky. Many pilots and air traffic controllers had been laid off or had retired, so companies struggled to keep up when demand started to recover after the initial pandemic slump, pushing prices sharply higher in 2022.
“We just didn’t have enough seats to go around last year,” Sharif said, explaining that although personnel issues persist, so far this year, the supply situation has been better. “Planes are still totally packed, but there are more planes.”
As people flock abroad, it is sapping some demand from hotels and tourist attractions in the United States. International tourists have yet to return to the United States in full force, so they are not entirely offsetting the wave of Americans headed overseas.
Domestic travel is hardly in a free fall — July 4 weekend travel probably set records, per AAA — but tourists are no longer so insatiable that hotels can keep raising room rates indefinitely. Prices for lodging away from home in the U.S. climbed by 4.5% in the year through June, which is far slower than the 25% annual increases hotel rooms were posting last spring. There is even elbow room at Disney World.
Even if it isn’t inflationary, the jump in foreign travel does highlight something about the U.S. economy: It’s hard to keep U.S. consumers down, especially affluent ones.
The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates to cool growth since early 2022. Officials have made it more expensive to borrow money in hopes of creating a ripple effect that would cut into demand and force companies to stop lifting prices so much.
Consumption has slowed amid that onslaught, but it hasn’t tanked. Fed officials have taken note, remarking at their last meeting that consumption had been “stronger than expected,” minutes showed.
The resilience comes as many households remain in solid financial shape. People who travel internationally skew wealthier, and many are benefiting from a rising stock market and still-high home prices that are beginning to prove surprisingly immune to interest rate moves.
Those who do not have big stock or real estate holdings are experiencing a strong job market, and some are still holding onto extra savings built up during the pandemic. And it is not just vacation destinations feeling the momentum: Consumers are still spending on a range of other services.
“There’s this last blowoff of spending,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist for insurance company Nationwide Mutual.
It could be that consumer resilience will help the U.S. economy avoid a recession as the Fed fights inflation. As has been the case at American hotels, demand that stabilizes without plummeting could allow for a slow and steady moderation of price increases.
But if consumers remain so ravenous that companies find they can still charge more, it could prolong inflation. That’s why the Fed is keeping a close eye on spending.
Bostjancic thinks consumers will pull back starting this fall. They are drawing down their savings, the labor market is cooling and it may simply take time for the Fed’s rate increases to have their full effect.
When it comes to many types of travel, there is no end in sight yet.
“Despite economic headwinds, we’re seeing very strong demand for summer leisure travel,” said Mike Daher, who leads the U.S. Transportation, Hospitality & Services practice at the consulting firm Deloitte.
Daher attributes that to three driving forces: People missed trips; social media is luring many to new places; and the advent of remote work is allowing professionals — “what we call the laptop luggers,” per Daher — to stretch out vacations by working a few days from the beach or the mountains.
Calvo is riding the wave, taking Americans on tours that showcase Paris’ shared history with France and driving them in minivan tours to Champagne.
“I have no clue if it’s going to last,” he said.

The Puny Power of 'Woke Capitalism': [Op-Ed]

Full text: Early last year, the musician India.Arie posted a video on her Instagram that caused a lot of headaches for my then-employer, Spotify. It was a mash-up of the many times Spotify's star podcaster, Joe Rogan, had used a racial slur for Black people on his show. I don't need to tell you which slur it was. Unsurprisingly, the video quickly went viral, and a huge uproar ensued.
Rogan had already stirred up controversy by airing Covid misinformation and interviews with transphobic speakers. For Spotify, a company based in Sweden (the supposed mecca of social democracy) that serves entertainment to a largely young, socially conscious consumer base and employs a young, socially conscious work force, you'd think it would be obvious -- if you were to listen to the characterization common from conservative politicians and "heterodox" pundits -- what would happen next. The dictates of "woke capitalism" would surely require a ritual sacrifice of Rogan, despite the huge sums Spotify had paid to bring his show exclusively to its platform. It wouldn't matter that he was the company's No. 1 podcaster. The woke mob had spoken!
Needless to say, that's not how things went. Rogan apologized in a long Instagram video, and Spotify's response was not to pull the plug on his show and torpedo the interests of the company's shareholders. Spotify stood by its star (even as several episodes were quietly removed). It also announced a $ 100 million fund to support underrepresented artists and podcasters. But, according to Bloomberg, a year later the company had spent less than 10 percent of the money.
Behold, the puny power of woke capitalism!
I have been thinking about this incident as I have watched ferocious campaigns building against companies that take even the most milquetoast stands on social and cultural issues, especially those involving gender and sexuality. It reached a peak last month with Pride, leaving a wake of social media videos of people outraged about things like onesies and koozies emblazoned with rainbows.
These fights won't stop with the end of Pride month. They are merely the skirmishes in what is likely to be a long culture war fueled by outrage about everything from the casting of a Black actor as Ariel in Disney's live-action remake of "The Little Mermaid" to investment funds including a modicum of concern about diversity and inclusion in deciding where to put their billions.
"Woke capital" is already a major theme of the Republican presidential race. The threat is apparently so great that Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida invoked Winston Churchill's famous Dunkirk speech, substituting "woke" for the Axis powers as enemy No. 1: "We will wage a war on the woke. We will fight the woke in education, we will fight the woke in the corporations, we will fight the woke in the halls of Congress." Vivek Ramaswamy is couching much of his campaign in the themes of his 2021 book, "Woke, Inc.," an excoriation of so-called woke capitalism that is somehow to blame not just for America's social woes, but its economic problems, too.
This hyping of the power of socially conscious capitalism is understandable given how aggressively the notion has been sold to companies and consumers. Research studies, many of them conducted by companies that advise businesses on corporate social responsibility, have touted the power of "purpose" to drive consumer loyalty.
Color me skeptical. Consumers make choices for many reasons: price, convenience and marketing. Maybe politics. The other day I went to my local Walgreens to buy toothpaste and ultimately chose not my favorite brand but the only one that wasn't under lock and key. I didn't want to wait for an employee to liberate the Colgate, so Crest it was. Needless to say, I did not use Google to find out which brand was more committed to bodily autonomy. What can I say? I was in a hurry.
My somewhat jaundiced view of the possibilities and perils of woke capitalism was shaped by seeing some of this play out from inside the corporate suite, albeit in the limited context of media and tech companies, running the editorial and business ends of a podcast company at Spotify and a global news organization, HuffPost, when it was owned by Verizon Media.
I have bad news for combatants on both sides of this war. For those on the left who take comfort in seeing big companies take bold stands on issues they care about, I'm here to tell you that those companies care much more about their bottom line than your beloved issue (see Spotify example above).
And those on the right who feel that the wind is at their back with successful boycotts of "woke" brands are likely to be disappointed for similar reasons. Even this year's big success -- a boycott of Bud Light after it worked with a transgender influencer as part of a broader social media campaign that apparently caused the stock of the brewing giant Anheuser-Busch to drop -- was a Pyrrhic victory: It is all but impossible to find beer companies that don't participate in celebrating Pride, thereby doing exactly what the right accuses them of: pushing a liberal agenda antithetical to conservative mores.
It turns out queer consumers and their allies are important to companies' bottom line, and -- especially in a tight labor market -- companies can hardly afford to alienate queer workers and their families and supporters. Even after getting dinged by conservative consumers and gay rights activists, Bud Light pledged to keep supporting queer businesses.
These fights disguise a bigger truth: Corporations, far from dictating cultural mores from some capitalist Mount Olympus, reflect and co-opt the social trends around them.
In 2018, as the Black Lives Matter movement gathered force, Nike created a controversial ad campaign with Colin Kaepernick, the Black football player who famously knelt during the national anthem to protest police racism and brutality toward Black civilians. The backlash was huge, but ultimately the social tide went in Nike's favor: Its stock price popped and the advertising campaign was seen as a bold success.
But corporations can also shift course, quite seamlessly, when the mood changes.
At Cannes Lions, an advertising festival held each June in the South of France, members of this year's jury that hands out awards for ad campaigns were instructed to steer clear of politics and celebrate work that was more focused on commercial success, Semafor reported.
This is a remarkable turnaround. I attended the festival a couple of times in my years as a media executive, and it often seemed like a competition to see what company could out-do-gooder the rest. It reminded me of a line from the HBO comedy "Silicon Valley," in which a tech executive declares, "I don't want to live in a world where someone else is making the world a better place better than we are."
After the murder of George Floyd, companies fell all over themselves to embrace Black causes. Some actions were gestures that cost nothing, like music streaming services observing a period of silence. Content companies pledged to increase their programming for, by and about Black people. Many businesses made pledges to diversify hiring, especially in their executive ranks.
But the evidence so far shows little progress on these pledges. Netflix, the once unstoppable juggernaut that seemed likely to eat Hollywood for breakfast, is an interesting case in point. As its growth has slowed and the political climate has changed, it reportedly shelved a plan to produce an anti-racist video series. A look at its published diversity and inclusion track record shows a small decline in the proportion of Black employees generally and executives in particular.
Thomas Frank, a historian and journalist who has chronicled the culture wars for decades, told me that he "always suspected that the backlash politics that rolled over the country in the late '60s and all through the 1970s came, at least in part, from the way commercial culture rubbed the noses of Middle America in coolness and in Middle America's own inadequacy and uncoolness. But the political backlash that resulted didn't hurt the corporations at all -- on the contrary, they eventually just changed their marketing approach to fit the new mood and then entered a golden age with Reagan and the 1980s."
The center left has been lulled by its seeming cultural power, which buttresses the belief that progress is inevitable if the time frame is elongated enough. In a world with "RuPaul's Drag Race," "How could we be talking about locking up drag queens?" we gasp.
The deeper problem is that our politics is not responsive to people's preferences. Our systems of government increasingly favor electoral minorities -- like gerrymandered state legislatures in a polarized environment -- rather than common-sense compromise. This leads to ideological zealotry. There are almost no checks on a state legislature bent on maximum cruelty.
In this atmosphere it is not that surprising that progressive consumers have turned to corporations to be a mirror of their concerns. Despite clear majority support for abortion rights and L.G.B.T.Q. rights, we are tilting ever more toward a system that allows a fanatical minority to impose its views as law. It's easier for us to hold corporations accountable than politicians. We make decisions about how to spend our money every day. Best-case scenario is you vote in new officials every couple of years.
But woke capitalism is a paper tiger. Companies embrace identity and cultural inclusion as a way to expand their market share to new communities while obscuring their raw political power and the ruthless underpinning realities of shareholder capitalism. Elites on the right, meanwhile, know very well that it is a paper tiger but are more than happy to play along with a shuck and jive that allows them to wield "woke" as a cudgel against the left -- and for some voters, it does the vital job of stoking resentment.
Following the dictates of plain old capitalism, Spotify choosing to stand by Joe Rogan, once the company had signed him up as an exclusive podcaster, was a good business decision. But the decision also made business sense for other reasons. It meant that if a right-wing mob came for queer programming on the platform, the company could point to that decision as it defends hosting podcasts that my colleagues made, stuff like "The Two Princes," a fantasy show for kids about two princes who fall in love, and "Gay Pride & Prejudice," a modern take on the Jane Austen classic. A simple policy of consistency about free speech within defined limits rather than appeals to the extremes of the culture wars is, frankly, better for everyone.
Above all, these partisan spats over politics and business serve as a useful reminder for everyone across the political spectrum: Corporations are not your friends. They do not represent your interests. Yield to their power at your own peril.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Popular content produced in Asia and around the world has taken on greater significance with most of Hollywood now on strike.
They met in a 20th-floor conference room in Seoul named for one successful project with Korean talent -- "Okja," a 2017 film of one girl's devotion to a genetically modified super pig -- to discuss what they hoped would become another hit.
Quickly, the gathering of Netflix's South Korea team became an unhappy focus group, with a barrage of nitpicks and critiques about the script for a coming-of-age fantasy show.
One person said the story line pulled in too many fantastical -- and foreign -- elements instead of focusing on character and plot. The creative components struck another person as too hard to grasp, and out of touch.
Finally, the executive who was championing the project offered a diagnosis: The writer had watched too much Netflix.
Inspired by the streaming service's success in turning Korean-language shows into international hits, the writer wanted this show to go global, too, and thought more far-fetched flourishes would appeal overseas.
The fix, the executive said, was the opposite. The script needed to "Koreanize" the show, ground it in local realism and turn some foreign characters into Korean roles.
It's a turbulent time in Hollywood, with television and movie actors now on strike, joining the screenwriters who have been picketing since May. Netflix has become a focal point of frustration for the ways streaming services have upended the traditional television model.
Amid this uncertainty, Netflix remains locked in its goal: It wants to dominate the entertainment world, but it is pursuing that ambition one country at a time. Instead of creating shows and movies that appeal to all 190 countries where the service is available, Netflix is focusing on content that resonates with a single market's audience.
The overseas content has taken on even greater significance with Hollywood effectively shut down. The comedies and dramas produced outside the United States, like the ideas being decided on in that Seoul conference room, could be some of the only new content on offer.
In April, before the writers went on strike, Ted Sarandos, one of Netflix's co-chief executives, said he hoped it wouldn't come to that -- but also promised that viewers wouldn't be without options. "We have a large base of upcoming shows and films from around the world," he said.
That large base comes from around the world, but is specific to each country it comes from.
"When we're making shows in Korea, we're going to make sure it's for Koreans," said Minyoung Kim, Netflix's vice president of content in Asia. "When we're making shows in Japan, it is going to be for the Japanese. In Thailand, it's going to be for Thai people. We are not trying to make everything global."
Netflix's 2023 Emmy nominations tell one story of its ambitions: It received nods Wednesday for its prestige drama "The Crown," its comedy-drama "Beef" and its reality shows "Love Is Blind" and "Queer Eye."
In addition to that wide spectrum of English-language programming, Netflix's ambition is to expand in relatively untapped regions like Asia and Latin America, beyond its saturated core markets in the United States and Europe, where subscriber growth is slowing. It is allocating more of its $ 17 billion annual content budget to expanding its foreign language programming and attracting customers abroad.
But the company is also betting that a compelling story somewhere is compelling everywhere, no matter the language.
This year, Netflix developed "The Glory," a binge-worthy revenge saga about a woman striking back against childhood bullies, which cracked the top five most-watched non-English-language TV shows ever on the service. Before that, at one point "Extraordinary Attorney Woo," a feel-good show about a lawyer with autism, was in the weekly Top 10 chart in 54 countries. Last year, 60 percent of Netflix subscribers watched a Korean-language show or movie.
In building an audience abroad, Netflix has a head start on other major streaming platforms, although Disney and Amazon have announced plans to build their catalogs of international content. In many Asian markets, Netflix is also competing with a local streaming option -- often created by broadcasters wary of ceding control to foreign media giants.
Asia, Netflix's fastest-growing region, is a key battleground because customers watch a higher percentage of programming in their native tongues. Netflix already has shows in more than 30 Asian languages.
That's where Ms. Kim, 42, comes in.
Ms. Kim joined Netflix in 2016. Her job is, essentially, to help Netflix do something that has never been done before: build a truly global entertainment service with shows in every market, while selling Americans on the appeal of foreign-language content. If she is daunted by the demand, she doesn't show it.
She is chatty and direct, with an almost encyclopedic knowledge of Korean television dramas. But perhaps most importantly for her task, she is the woman who gave the Netflix-watching world "Squid Game."
'Don't expect miracles'
In 2016, Netflix rented Dongdaemun Design Plaza, a Seoul landmark and futuristic exhibition space, for a red-carpet affair featuring the stars of one of its biggest shows at the time: "Orange Is the New Black."
The hors d'oeuvres were served, on theme with the show, on food trays meant to mimic prison. Netflix was arriving in South Korea's entertainment industry with a big splash. But the tongue-in-cheek humor felt inhospitable and culturally out of touch, according to industry people who attended. It left the impression of an American company that did not understand Korea.
It was a clumsy start. A few months later, when Ms. Kim began in her role as Netflix's first content executive in Asia with a focus on South Korea, she warned the company's executives: "Don't expect miracles."
Ms. Kim said she needed to make Netflix feel less foreign and sell creators on why they should work with the company.
She traveled to visit producers at their offices instead of summoning them to see her. She arranged regular boozy dinners with producers -- the custom in South Korea -- knowing that it was difficult to gain their trust until they got drunk with her.
Over lunch, where she had a steaming bowl of beef offal soup, she described her strategy.
"Here, you first have to build a relationship," Ms. Kim said. "At the time, I think the way we approached things felt very transactional and aggressive. When it comes to Asian partners, oftentimes it's more than just the money we put on the table."
Early in her tenure, she came across a movie script called "Squid Game" by Hwang Dong-hyuk, a respected local filmmaker. He had written it a decade earlier and could never find a studio to finance it. She said she immediately loved the irony of a gory "death game" thriller based around traditional Korean children's games. She thought the concept might work better as a TV show, allowing for more character development than a two-hour film.
But it seemed like a strange choice for one of her first big bets. Similar titles were in the young-adult genre, such as "The Hunger Games" or "Battle Royale," a Japanese cult film in which a group of students fight to the death.
"Who wants to see a death game with poor old people?" she recalled being asked by a member of her team.
But after she saw the set designs, she was convinced that it would be a big hit in South Korea. Netflix decided to change the English title to "Round Six" to appeal to an international audience. Near the release date, Mr. Hwang asked to change the title back because he felt that "Squid Game" was closer to the show's essence.
Much to everyone's surprise, "Squid Game" garnered an enormous number of views in South Korea and across the world. It was a sensation that broke into the cultural zeitgeist, complete with a "Saturday Night Live" skit and Halloween costumes. And Netflix finally threw the right kind of party for the show's Korean cast: an after-party, after dominating last year's Emmy Awards.
"Squid Game" changed everything. It became the most-watched show ever on Netflix, and it spurred interest in other Korean content. In April, to coincide with a visit to the United States by South Korea's president, Yoon Suk Yeol, Netflix said it was planning to invest $ 2.5 billion in Korean shows and movies in the next four years, which is double its investment since 2016.
After decades of Hollywood's delivering blockbusters to the world, Netflix is trying to flip the model. Mr. Sarandos said that "Squid Game" proved that a hit show could emerge from anywhere and in any language and that the odds of success for a Hollywood show versus an international show were not that different.
"That's really never been done before," he said at an investor conference in December. "Locally produced content can play big all over the world, so it's not just America supplying the rest of world content."
'Green-light rigor'
Global expansion requires a guiding principle. For Ms. Kim, that's "green-light rigor," a mind-set she brought to Netflix's office in the Roppongi district of Tokyo, where she moved last year to oversee the content teams in Asia-Pacific except for India.
In some Asian countries, she explained, Netflix has a more limited budget, so the company has to select only the "must-haves" and pass on "nice-to-haves." Green-light rigor also means not pandering to what Netflix imagines viewers across the world want.
How that discipline played out in practice was on display when the Japanese content team met to discuss whether to option a book for a show in late January.
The book in question was a love story set in a dystopian world with elements of science fiction. A data analyst said that based on the show's projected "value," he wondered whether Netflix would recoup its investment because of the sizable budgets usually required for science fiction.
Kaata Sakamoto, who heads the Japanese content team, said he worried about the mismatched expectations of viewers who might come expecting a romance drama and then find themselves in hard-core science fiction.
"It's like someone who goes into a restaurant and they are served food that is different from what they want to eat," he said. "If this is a 'Romeo and Juliet' tale, do we need a big sci-fi world setting? It feels like mixed soup."
The executive pitching the project said the writer watched "a lot of Netflix" and was aware of what was popular. So instead of a pure love story, he wanted to infuse elements of dystopian science fiction -- a popular genre on Netflix.
But Mr. Sakamoto, who played an active role in producing some of Netflix's hits from Japan, seemed unconvinced.
"My question is what is it about this project that is uniquely Japanese?" he asked.
Netflix's Tokyo office exudes an American vibe, but very little English is spoken in the creative meetings. This was the case when Mr. Sakamoto met with Shinsuke Sato, creator of "Alice in Borderland," a science-fiction survival thriller that was Netflix's biggest hit in Japan, to discuss a coming project.
It was a free-flowing discussion that touched on minute details of the project, from character development to plot twists to which scary animals would work best in computer graphics -- reptiles could be easier than furry creatures, suggested Akira Mori, a producer who works with Mr. Sato. ("Maybe an alligator?")
Later, Mr. Sakamoto said that in the past, a lot of talented Japanese who were successful in Japan had struggled to break through in Hollywood because they didn't speak English well.
"But what Netflix has allowed is that creators can make work in their own countries in their own language, and if the storytelling is good and the quality is there, they can reach a global audience," he said. "This is a major game changer."
Vision come to life
The increased expectations are apparent throughout Netflix's high-rise office in Seoul. The meeting rooms are named after its prominent Korean movies and shows. In the canteen, a human-size replica of the doll from "Squid Game" looms over a selection of Korean snacks and instant noodles.
Ms. Kim's vision of creating a diverse slate of Korean shows has come to life. "Physical: 100," a gladiator-style game show in which contestants fight for survival and a cash prize, was in the Top 10 of non-English shows for six weeks. This year, at least three Korean shows have been among the top-10 foreign language shows every week.
"It's exciting, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel the pressure," said Don Kang, Netflix's vice president of content in South Korea, who has succeeded Ms. Kim in overseeing South Korea.
Mr. Kang, who is soft-spoken with a baby face, joined in 2018 after heading international sales at CJ ENM, a Korean entertainment conglomerate. When he started, Netflix was still operating out of a WeWork office.
He said that before Netflix, he thought there wouldn't be much international interest in Korean reality shows or shows that weren't romantic comedies.
"I was very happy to be proven wrong," Mr. Kang said.
Netflix's slate of Korean programs runs the gamut from romantic comedies to dark shows like "Hellbound," an adaptation of a digital comic book about supernatural beings condemning people to hell. Yeon Sang-ho, the director of "Hellbound," said such niche content wouldn't be made by Korean broadcasters because the audience wasn't big enough to justify the budget.
"Netflix has a worldwide audience, which means that we can try more genres and we can try more nonmainstream things, too," Mr. Yeon said. "Creators who work with Netflix can now try the risky things that they wanted to do but they weren't able to."
Netflix's success has reshaped South Korea's entertainment industry. TV production budgets have increased as much as tenfold per episode in the last few years, said Lee Young-lyoul, a professor at the Seoul Institute of the Arts, and there is growing concern that domestic broadcasters will struggle to compete.
Production companies need Netflix's investments to hire top writers, directors and actors, creating a "vicious cycle of dependency," according to "Netflix and Platform Imperialism," an academic paper published in The International Journal of Communication this year.
The extraordinary success of "Extraordinary Attorney Woo" highlights the tensions.
AStory, the show's production company, rejected Netflix's offer to finance the entire second season, because of its previous experience with the service. AStory made "Kingdom," a hit Korean zombie period show, as a Netflix original, meaning Netflix owned all the show's intellectual property rights in exchange for paying the full production costs.
"While it's true that Netflix helped the series get popular, our company couldn't do anything with that," said Lee Sang-baek, AStory's chief executive. "There are lots of regrets there."
Mr. Kang said that Netflix had a good relationship with AStory and that the situation was complex. He said Netflix had been "very, very generous" in compensating creators and actors but emphasized the need to grow in a "sustainable" way.
"You do sometimes hear those types of concerns: Is Netflix taking too much from our industry? But you can't be in this business and operate that way," Mr. Kang said.
'Too Hot to Handle' around the world
One by one, Ms. Kim rattled off the unique traits of audiences around the region. Korean audiences prefer happy endings in romance. Japanese dramas tend to portray emotion in an understated way. Chinese-language viewers are more accepting of a sad love story. ("The Taiwanese staff always says a romance has to be sad. Somebody has to die.")
Ms. Kim understands that local stories share universal themes, but the key to Netflix's work is to understand these cultural differences.
When Netflix's "Too Hot to Handle," a tawdry reality dating show with contestants from the United States and Britain, did well in South Korea and Japan, the company decided to make its own shows in the respective countries. But instead of programs replete with sex and hooking up, Netflix's versions in South Korea ("Singles Inferno") and Japan ("Terrace House") were more suited to local sensibilities: only hints of romance with minimal touching or flirting.
Storytelling can also differ. Impressions of the first episode of "Physical: 100" were divided by geography. Ms. Kim said she found that in general, American audiences thought the extensive back stories about the contestants slowed the show. Korean audiences liked the back stories because they wanted to know more about the contestants.
Ms. Kim recalled how Netflix's U.S. executives asked her why the first Squid Game contest did not come until the last 20 minutes of the first episode. She was puzzled, because this was fast for Korean audiences -- but not fast enough for American sensibilities. In South Korea, the action often does not start until the fourth episode because shows often follow the cadence of a story arc suited to a 16-episode broadcast TV schedule.
Ms. Kim said she thought that audiences would tolerate work that defied their expectations or values when it was foreign, but that it must be authentic when it was local.
So far, that philosophy has been successful. "Squid Game" proves that. But it also shows the new challenge that awaits Netflix -- once something is a global hit, there are global expectations.
Leonardo DiCaprio is a fan, and Mr. Hwang, the writer-director, even teased that the Hollywood A-lister could join the "games," a boost that most people chasing global domination might find hard to resist. But Netflix did manage it -- for now.
Last month, when the cast was announced, it featured all Korean actors.

Spinning Vinyl, and Enjoying a Marathon First Date: [Society Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Nasir Qadree stopped Chloe Louvouezo on the street and invited her to hear him D.J. A 24-hour date followed the next day.
One day in March 2021, Chloe Dulce Louvouezo was on her way to a coffee shop to tackle a creative exercise in "The Artist's Way" workbook before meeting a friend for lunch.
"Do you like vinyl?" asked Nasir Cedell Qadree as he walked up to her in the Union Market district of Northeast Washington, trying to plug Byrdland Records, a nearby vinyl shop where he spent Saturday afternoons spinning funk, soul, boogie, disco and house music.
Mr. Qadree, 38, primarily works as a managing partner of Zeal Capital Partners, a venture capital firm he founded, which focuses on investing in diverse management teams.
"I do," she said. "Why do you ask?"
He was encouraged by her more-than-one-word reply.
"I'm spinning vinyl at 2 p.m.," he said. "You should come by."
They then locked eyes, took off their Covid masks and smiled.
Ms. Louvouezo, 37, a single mother whose son Myel, now 7, was away for the weekend, quickly called her friend. They decided to reconnoiter at Byrdland before lunch.
"We only spent 10 minutes digging through vinyl crates," Ms. Louvouezo said. As they passed by his D.J. booth on the way out, Mr. Qadree reached over to hand her his card.
He later picked up margaritas to go at Taqueria Las Gemelas, which happened to be where Ms. Louvouezo and her friend were having lunch. She then got his name off the card, and called him over. They chatted for 15 minutes.
"It was nice to meet you," she texted right after he left.
At 7:02 a.m. the next day, he replied asking if she wanted to grab some coffee that morning.
"I didn't want to seem eager," she said. "I forced myself to count to 60 a couple of times."
They met at a Le Pain Quotidien later that morning on Capitol Hill.
Mr. Qadree was surprised they had never met before. "We're name-dropping friends," he said. "We spent time in New York. We're both creatives in our own right. We're also college rivals."
Mr. Qadree, who grew up in Atlanta, graduated with a bachelor's degree in marketing from Hampton University in Hampton, Va., and she with a bachelor's in journalism from Howard University.

Ms. Louvouezo, who grew up in Niger, West Africa, also received a master of professional studies in public relations and corporate communications from Georgetown. She is now a senior creative producer at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and also wrote "Life, I Swear: Intimate Stories from Black Women on Identity, Healing and Self-Trust," part memoir, part anthology, published by HarperCollins in November 2021.
Their first date lasted 24 hours.
"It was clear we were into each other," Mr. Qadree said.
They stopped for pizza in the City Center area, and when he mentioned he did not have the right backdrop for his 5 a.m. financial segment on CNBC the next morning, she told him she had actually rented out her place to production companies. He asked if he could check it out and found it more than suitable. "Her décor is amazing," he said.
As she later adjusted his laptop on a tripod, she sat on his lap to get a better angle, which also happened to be just the right angle for their first kiss.
"I don't want crazy love," she said. "I want peaceful love. I want safe love. I want secure love."
"OK," he said, and sealed it with another kiss.
The next afternoon, when Ms. Louvouezo took her son for ice cream before his weekly swim lesson in the Navy Yard area, they bumped into Mr. Qadree, who lived nearby and picked up a couple of smoothies.
"Do you work here?" her son asked Mr. Qadree. "Maybe we could do a play date."
A few hours later the three had dinner at an Italian restaurant where her son fell asleep on her lap.
"He was a smart ambitious kid that reminded me of myself in a single family household," Mr. Qadree said.
They began seeing each other every day, and Mr. Qadree was a big hit when he showed up as Spiderman for Myel's 5th birthday in May.
"I knew he was here to stay," Ms. Louvouezo said.
That summer Mr. Qadree joined her for three weddings, moved in with them in August and that fall accompanied her on a seven-city book tour. He stood by her as she spoke about past heartbreaks, healing, grieving, starting over and second chances.
In 2022, during Memorial Day weekend, they celebrated Myel's 6th birthday with a three-day trip to Disney World in Orlando, and on the last day, Mr. Qadree proposed along a beach.
On July 1, the Rev. Dr. A. Craig Dunn, a Baptist minister and the groom's godfather, officiated before 150 guests at Woodend Sanctuary & Mansion in Chevy Chase, Md., where the couple jumped the broom, and then led everyone in the rain to the festivities, M.C.'d by DJ Epik.
"My son started the toasts with an epic speech," said Ms. Louvouezo, who is taking the groom's name; the couple are taking her surname as a second middle name. And then there's the other way Mr. Qadree refers to her: "My better three-quarters."

SEOUL, South Korea — They met in a 20th-floor conference room in Seoul named for one successful project with Korean talent — “Okja,” a 2017 film of one girl’s devotion to a genetically modified super pig — to discuss what they hoped would become another hit.
Quickly, the gathering of Netflix’s South Korea team became an unhappy focus group, with a barrage of nitpicks and critiques about the script for a coming-of-age fantasy show.
One person said the storyline pulled in too many fantastical — and foreign — elements instead of focusing on character and plot. The creative components struck another person as too hard to grasp, and out of touch.
Finally, the executive who was championing the project offered a diagnosis: The writer had watched too much Netflix.
Inspired by the streaming service’s success in turning Korean-language shows into international hits, the writer wanted this show to go global, too, and thought more far-fetched flourishes would appeal overseas.
The fix, the executive said, was the opposite. The script needed to “Koreanize” the show, ground it in local realism and turn some foreign characters into Korean roles.
It’s a turbulent time in Hollywood, with television and movie actors now on strike, joining the screenwriters who have picketing since May. Netflix has become a focal point of frustration for the ways streaming services have upended the traditional television model.
Amid this uncertainty, Netflix remains locked in its goal: It wants to dominate the entertainment world, but it is pursuing that ambition one country at a time. Instead of creating shows and movies that appeal to all 190 countries where the service is available, Netflix is focusing on content that resonates with a single market’s audience.
The overseas content has taken on even greater significance with Hollywood effectively shut down. The comedies and dramas produced overseas, like the ideas being decided on in that Seoul conference room, could be some of the only new content on offer.
In April, before the writers went on strike, Ted Sarandos, one of Netflix’s co-CEOs, said he hoped it wouldn’t come to that — but also promised that viewers wouldn’t be without options. “We have a large base of upcoming shows and films from around the world,” he said.
That large base comes from around the world but is specific to each country it comes from.
“When we’re making shows in Korea, we’re going to make sure it’s for Koreans,” said Minyoung Kim, Netflix’s vice president of content in Asia. “When we’re making shows in Japan, it is going to be for the Japanese. In Thailand, it’s going to be for Thai people. We are not trying to make everything global.”
Netflix’s 2023 Emmy nominations tell one story of its ambitions: It received nods Wednesday for its prestige drama “The Crown,” its comedy-drama “Beef,” and its reality shows “Love Is Blind” and “Queer Eye.”
In addition to that wide spectrum of English-language programming, Netflix’s ambition is to expand in relatively untapped regions such as Asia and Latin America, beyond its saturated core markets in the United States and Europe, where subscriber growth is slowing. It is allocating more of its $17 billion annual content budget to expanding its foreign language programming and attracting customers abroad.
But the company is also betting that a compelling story somewhere is compelling everywhere, no matter the language.
This year, Netflix developed “The Glory,” a binge-worthy revenge saga about a woman striking back against childhood bullies, which cracked the Top 5 most-watched non-English-language TV shows ever on the service. Before that, at one point “Extraordinary Attorney Woo,” a feel-good show about a lawyer with autism, was in the weekly Top 10 chart in 54 countries. Last year, 60% of Netflix subscribers watched a Korean-language show or movie.
In building an audience abroad, Netflix has a head start on other major streaming platforms, although Disney and Amazon have announced plans to build their catalogs of international content. In many Asian markets, Netflix is also competing with a local streaming option — often created by broadcasters wary of ceding control to foreign media giants.
Asia, Netflix’s fastest-growing region, is a key battleground because customers watch a higher percentage of programming in their native tongues. Netflix already has shows in more than 30 Asian languages.
That’s where Kim, 42, comes in.
Kim joined Netflix in 2016. Her job is, essentially, to help Netflix do something that has never been done before: build a truly global entertainment service with shows in every market, while selling Americans on the appeal of foreign-language content. If she is daunted by the demand, she doesn’t show it.
She is chatty and direct, with an almost encyclopedic knowledge of Korean television dramas. But perhaps most importantly for her task, she is the woman who gave the Netflix-watching world “Squid Game.”
‘Don’t expect miracles’
In 2016, Netflix rented Dongdaemun Design Plaza, a Seoul landmark and futuristic exhibition space, for a red-carpet affair featuring the stars of one of its biggest shows at the time: “Orange Is the New Black.”
The hors d’oeuvres were served, on theme with the show, on food trays meant to mimic prison. Netflix was arriving in South Korea’s entertainment industry with a big splash. But the tongue-in-cheek humor felt inhospitable and culturally out of touch, according to industry people who attended. It left the impression of an American company that did not understand Korea.
It was a clumsy start. A few months later, when Kim began in her role as Netflix’s first content executive in Asia with a focus on South Korea, she warned the company’s executives: “Don’t expect miracles.”
Kim said she needed to make Netflix feel less foreign and sell creators on why they should work with the company.
She traveled to visit producers at their offices instead of summoning them to see her. She arranged regular boozy dinners with producers — the custom in South Korea — knowing that it was difficult to gain their trust until they got drunk with her.
Over lunch, where she had a steaming bowl of beef offal soup, she described her strategy.
“Here, you first have to build a relationship,” Kim said. “At the time, I think the way we approached things felt very transactional and aggressive. When it comes to Asian partners, oftentimes it’s more than just the money we put on the table.”
Early in her tenure, she came across a movie script called “Squid Game” by Hwang Dong-hyuk, a respected local filmmaker. He had written it a decade earlier and could never find a studio to finance it. She said she immediately loved the irony of a gory “death game” thriller based around traditional Korean children’s games. She thought the concept might work better as a TV show, allowing for more character development than a two-hour film.
But it seemed like a strange choice for one of her first big bets. Similar titles were in the young-adult genre, such as “The Hunger Games” or “Battle Royale,” a Japanese cult film in which a group of students fight to the death.
“Who wants to see a death game with poor old people?” she recalled being asked by a member of her team.
But after she saw the set designs, she was convinced that it would be a big hit in South Korea. Netflix decided to change the English title to “Round Six” to appeal to an international audience. Near the release date, Hwang asked to change the title back because he felt that “Squid Game” was closer to the show’s essence.
Much to everyone’s surprise, “Squid Game” garnered an enormous number of views in South Korea and across the world. It was a sensation that broke into the cultural zeitgeist, complete with a “Saturday Night Live” skit and Halloween costumes. And Netflix finally threw the right kind of party for the show’s Korean cast: an after-party, after dominating last year’s Emmy Awards.
“Squid Game” changed everything. It became the most-watched show on Netflix, and it spurred interest in other Korean content. In April, to coincide with a visit to the United States by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, Netflix said it was planning to invest $2.5 billion in Korean shows and movies in the next four years, which is double its investment since 2016.
After decades of Hollywood’s delivering blockbusters to the world, Netflix is trying to flip the model. Sarandos said that “Squid Game” proved that a hit show could emerge from anywhere and in any language and that the odds of success for a Hollywood show versus an international show were not that different.
“That’s really never been done before,” he said at an investor conference in December. “Locally produced content can play big all over the world, so it’s not just America supplying the rest of world content.”
‘Green-light rigor’
Global expansion requires a guiding principle. For Kim, that’s “green-light rigor,” a mindset she brought to Netflix’s office in the Roppongi district of Tokyo, where she moved last year to oversee the content teams in Asia-Pacific except for India.
In some Asian countries, she said, Netflix has a more limited budget, so the company has to select only the “must-haves” and pass on “nice-to-haves.” Green-light rigor also means not pandering to what Netflix imagines viewers across the world want.
How that discipline played out in practice was on display when the Japanese content team met to discuss whether to option a book for a show in late January.
The book in question was a love story set in a dystopian world with elements of science fiction. A data analyst said that based on the show’s projected “value,” he wondered whether Netflix would recoup its investment because of the sizable budgets usually required for science fiction.
Kaata Sakamoto, who heads the Japanese content team, said he worried about the mismatched expectations of viewers who might come expecting a romance drama and then find themselves in hard-core science fiction.
“It’s like someone who goes into a restaurant and they are served food that is different from what they want to eat,” he said. “If this is a ‘Romeo and Juliet’ tale, do we need a big sci-fi world setting? It feels like mixed soup.”
The executive pitching the project said the writer watched “a lot of Netflix” and was aware of what was popular. So, instead of a pure love story, he wanted to infuse elements of dystopian science fiction — a popular genre on Netflix.
But Sakamoto, who played an active role in producing some of Netflix’s hits from Japan, seemed unconvinced.
“My question is: What is it about this project that is uniquely Japanese?” he asked.
Netflix’s Tokyo office exudes an American vibe, but very little English is spoken in the creative meetings. This was the case when Sakamoto met with Shinsuke Sato, creator of “Alice in Borderland,” a science-fiction survival thriller that was Netflix’s biggest hit in Japan, to discuss a coming project.
It was a free-flowing discussion that touched on minute details of the project, from character development to plot twists to which scary animals would work best in computer graphics — reptiles could be easier than furry creatures, suggested Akira Mori, a producer who works with Sato. (“Maybe an alligator?”)
Later, Sakamoto said that in the past, a lot of talented Japanese who were successful in Japan had struggled to break through in Hollywood because they didn’t speak English well.
“But what Netflix has allowed is that creators can make work in their own countries in their own language, and if the storytelling is good and the quality is there, they can reach a global audience,” he said. “This is a major game changer.”
Vision come to life
The increased expectations are apparent throughout Netflix’s high-rise office in Seoul. The meeting rooms are named after its prominent Korean movies and shows. In the canteen, a human-size replica of the doll from “Squid Game” looms over a selection of Korean snacks and instant noodles.
Kim’s vision of creating a diverse slate of Korean shows has come to life. “Physical: 100,” a gladiator-style game show in which contestants fight for survival and a cash prize, was in the Top 10 of non-English shows for six weeks. This year, at least three Korean shows have been among the Top 10 foreign language shows every week.
“It’s exciting, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t feel the pressure,” said Don Kang, Netflix’s vice president of content in South Korea, who has succeeded Kim in overseeing South Korea.
Kang, who is soft-spoken with a baby face, joined in 2018 after heading international sales at CJ ENM, a Korean entertainment conglomerate. When he started, Netflix was still operating out of a WeWork office.
He said that before Netflix, he thought there wouldn’t be much international interest in Korean reality shows or shows that weren’t romantic comedies.
“I was very happy to be proven wrong,” Kang said.
Netflix’s slate of Korean programs runs the gamut from romantic comedies to dark shows such as “Hellbound,” an adaptation of a digital comic book about supernatural beings condemning people to hell. Yeon Sang-ho, the director of “Hellbound,” said such niche content wouldn’t be made by Korean broadcasters because the audience wasn’t big enough to justify the budget.
“Netflix has a worldwide audience, which means that we can try more genres and we can try more nonmainstream things, too,” Yeon said. “Creators who work with Netflix can now try the risky things that they wanted to do but they weren’t able to.”
Netflix’s success has reshaped South Korea’s entertainment industry. TV production budgets have increased as much as tenfold per episode in the past few years, said Lee Young-lyoul, a professor at the Seoul Institute of the Arts, and there is growing concern that domestic broadcasters will struggle to compete.
Production companies need Netflix’s investments to hire top writers, directors and actors, creating a “vicious cycle of dependency,” according to “Netflix and Platform Imperialism,” an academic paper published in The International Journal of Communication this year.
The extraordinary success of “Extraordinary Attorney Woo” highlights the tensions.
AStory, the show’s production company, rejected Netflix’s offer to finance the entire second season, because of its previous experience with the service. AStory made “Kingdom,” a hit Korean zombie period show, as a Netflix original, meaning Netflix owned all the show’s intellectual property rights in exchange for paying the full production costs.
“While it’s true that Netflix helped the series get popular, our company couldn’t do anything with that,” said AStory CEO Lee Sang-baek. “There are lots of regrets there.”
Kang said that Netflix had a good relationship with AStory and that the situation was complex. He said Netflix had been “very, very generous” in compensating creators and actors but emphasized the need to grow in a “sustainable” way.
“You do sometimes hear those types of concerns: Is Netflix taking too much from our industry? But you can’t be in this business and operate that way,” Kang said.
‘Too Hot to Handle’ around the world
One by one, Kim rattled off the unique traits of audiences around the region. Korean audiences prefer happy endings in romance. Japanese dramas tend to portray emotion in an understated way. Chinese-language viewers are more accepting of a sad love story. (“The Taiwanese staff always says a romance has to be sad. Somebody has to die.”)
Kim understands that local stories share universal themes, but the key to Netflix’s work is to understand these cultural differences.
When Netflix’s “Too Hot to Handle,” a tawdry reality dating show with contestants from the United States and Britain, did well in South Korea and Japan, the company decided to make its own shows in the respective countries. But instead of programs replete with sex and hooking up, Netflix’s versions in South Korea (“Singles Inferno”) and Japan (“Terrace House”) were more suited to local sensibilities: only hints of romance with minimal touching or flirting.
Storytelling can also differ. Impressions of the first episode of “Physical: 100” were divided by geography. Kim said she found that in general, American audiences thought the extensive backstories about the contestants slowed the show. Korean audiences liked the backstories because they wanted to know more about the contestants.
Kim recalled how Netflix’s U.S. executives asked her why the first Squid Game contest did not come until the last 20 minutes of the first episode. She was puzzled, because this was fast for Korean audiences — but not fast enough for American sensibilities. In South Korea, the action often does not start until the fourth episode because shows often follow the cadence of a story arc suited to a 16-episode broadcast TV schedule.
Kim said she thought that audiences would tolerate work that defied their expectations or values when it was foreign, but that it must be authentic when it was local.
So far, that philosophy has been successful. “Squid Game” proves that. But it also shows the new challenge that awaits Netflix — once something is a global hit, there are global expectations.
Leonardo DiCaprio is a fan, and Hwang, the writer-director, even teased that the Hollywood A-lister could join the “games,” a boost that most people chasing global domination might find hard to resist. But Netflix did manage it — for now.
Last month, when the cast was announced, it featured all Korean actors.

Full text: One reporter is hooked on the French spectacle that mixes acrobatics with a rock opera score.
It seemed as if nothing would ever displace "The Phantom of the Opera" as my most-viewed musical.
And then, "Notre Dame de Paris" happened.
The 1998 French musical, which is based on Victor Hugo's epic 19th-century novel (as is the 1996 Disney animated adaptation), made its New York premiere last summer at the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center.
I saw it twice then and, when it returned this summer, two more times; a fifth viewing is planned for Sunday's closing performance in New York. And I'm not done: While in Paris this fall, I'll see it twice at its original theater, the Palais des Congrès, for its 25th anniversary.
As an avid theatergoer, I rarely go to the same production twice. (A recent exception was the Broadway revival of "A Doll's House," starring Jessica Chastain in a bewitching, minimalist march to self-discovery.)
And after initially seeing "Notre Dame de Paris," a second viewing didn't seem essential. The musical, which is sung in French with English supertitles, follows the beautiful Esmeralda and the three men who vie to win her love: the kind hunchback Quasimodo; the twisted archdeacon Frollo; and the egotistic soldier Phoebus.
The production has a plentiful serving of ear candy-esque power ballads sprinkled among its more than 50 (!) songs, but parts of it were also cheesy. A song debating the merits of the printing press at the top of Act II after a cliffhanger Act I ending? (I guess they had to leave at least one trademark Hugo tangent in there!) Frollo falling to one knee because he's so overwhelmed by his desire for Esmeralda? The poet-narrator Gringoire's Donny Osmond "Joseph" hair and psychedelic pants?
Of course, those elements were meant to be campy. And now, they're only part of my affection for the show.
But it's the show's particular brand of rock opera sorcery that wormed its way into my heart and took hold.
Blame "Belle."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Let me explain: About two-thirds of the way through the first act, there comes a song for the three men in love with Esmeralda that is the earworm equivalent of "The Music of the Night" in "The Phantom of the Opera." "Belle" (the French word for "beautiful") became the biggest-selling single of 1998 in France.
A YouTube video of the song from the original production -- featuring Daniel Lavoie as Frollo (Lavoie, now 74, is reprising the role in New York), along with Garou as Quasimodo and Patrick Fiori as Phoebus -- played on a loop for a week in my apartment.
Seeing the show for a second time last summer was a revelation: Already familiar with the plot, I didn't need to read the supertitles as much and could actually watch the actors, especially the mesmerizing acrobats. (What does the guy who spins on his head for 20 seconds have to do to get a chance with Esmeralda?)
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The show, I have since learned, has a cadre of superfans who have seen it six, 10, even 20 times. And they travel. (One treat for New York audiences: an orchestra. "Notre Dame" is usually performed with recorded music.)
So what is its hold on people?
The Canadian director Gilles Maheu, who oversaw the original Paris run and several tours since, including the current one, credits the show's timeless themes and music with its longevity.
"I wanted to do the show outside of current fashion," Maheu said of the musical, which maintains its original staging, in a recent video interview from his home in Frelighsburg, Quebec.
"The traditional story line of three different people loving the same woman is one I think people recognize easily," he added. "The songs are beautiful, and not only 'Belle."'
Holly Thomas, 26, a guest service representative for a Broadway ticketing company and a stage manager, first saw the show in New York last summer -- and is on track to have seen it 11 times here by the time it closes Sunday.
"It deals with issues that we're constantly dealing with as a general society -- racism, misogyny, the corruption of power," she said.
Michael Lewis, 52, an I.T. consultant based in Boston, attended one of the original performances in Paris 25 years ago, and has also seen the musical in London and New York. In addition to its timelessness, he said, "the theme of migrants seeking asylum has resonance today," he said, "especially given what just happened with the Pakistani immigrants on the way to Greece."
Here in New York, which is experiencing its own migrant crisis, the show's overtures for shelter and asylum have had similar poignancy.
My boss at The New York Times recently saw the show with his daughters -- and the next day I received a message from him: "I must have watched this video of 'Belle' on YouTube at least a dozen times today," he wrote.
"Is this how it starts?"

What to Know About Hollywood's Shutdown: [National Desk]

Author: Stevens, Matt

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Here's why Hollywood is facing its first industrywide shutdown in more than 60 years, and what it could mean for your favorite shows.
The union representing more than 150,000 television and movie actors announced Thursday that it would go on strike at midnight, joining screenwriters who walked out in May and creating Hollywood's first industrywide shutdown in 63 years.
Here is what you need to know.
Why are the actors and writers striking?
Pay is often at the center of work stoppages, and that is the case here. But the rise of streaming and the challenges created by the pandemic have stressed the studios, many of which are facing financial challenges, as well as actors and writers, who are seeking better pay and new protections in a rapidly changing workplace.
Both actors and screenwriters have demanded increased residual payments (a type of royalty) from streaming services. Streaming series typically have far fewer episodes than television series typically did. And it used to be that if a television series was a hit, actors and writers could count on a long stream of regular residual checks; streaming has changed the system in a way that they say has hurt them. Both groups also want aggressive guardrails around the use of artificial intelligence to preserve jobs.
A-list actors last month signed a letter to guild leadership saying they were ready to strike and calling this moment "an unprecedented inflection point in our industry."
What is the position of the Hollywood studios?
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents major studios and streamers, has said it offered "historic pay and residual increases" as well as higher caps on pension and health contributions. They also say their offer includes audition protections, a "groundbreaking" proposal on artificial intelligence and other benefits that address the union's concerns.
The Hollywood studios have also stressed that all the industry upheaval has not been easy for them, either. As moviegoers have been slow to return to cinemas and home viewers have moved from cable and network television to streaming entertainment, many studios have watched their share prices plummet and their profit margins shrink. Some companies have resorted to layoffs or pulled the plug on projects -- or both.
What will happen to my TV shows and movies?
It will take a while for filmgoers to notice a change, since most of the movies scheduled for release this year have already been shot. But TV viewers are already seeing the strike's effects, and if it drags on, popular shows could see their next seasons delayed.
Late-night shows are already airing reruns because of the writers' strike, and the vast majority of TV and film productions have already shut down or paused production. Big name shows like "Yellowjackets," "Severance" and "Stranger Things" halted work after the writers' strike began; it is not yet clear if their upcoming seasons will be delayed.
Disney announced several changes to its theatrical release calendar in June, amid the writers' strike.
Now, the actors' strike will add even greater upheaval.
During the first two weeks of July, no scripted TV permits were issued in Los Angeles County, according to FilmLA, which tracks production activity. Film and TV shows that have completed shooting and are already in postproduction can likely stay on schedule, because the work remaining does not typically involve writers or actors.
Participating in either film or television production with any of the studios is now off the table, with few exceptions. And that means that within a few months -- beginning with the fall lineup -- viewers will begin to notice broader changes to their TV diet.
The ABC fall schedule, for instance, will debut with nightly lineups that include "Celebrity Wheel of Fortune," "Dancing With the Stars" and "Judge Steve Harvey" as well as repeats of "Abbott Elementary. The Fox broadcast network's fall lineup includes unscripted series like "Celebrity Name That Tune," "The Masked Singer" and "Kitchen Nightmares."
How long could this all drag on?
If only we knew.
Writers have been walking the picket lines now for more than 70 days, and their union, the Writers Guild of America, has yet to return to bargaining with the studios.
The last time the writers and actors went on strike at the same time was in 1960, when Ronald Reagan was president of the Screen Actors Guild.
Screenwriters have walked out several times, sometimes for long periods: Their 2007 strike lasted 100 days. The actors last staged a major walkout in 1980; it lasted more than three months.
What about the promotion of current shows and films?
In the near term, officials have said there will be no promotion of current projects, either online or in person. Do not expect to hear Ryan Gosling touting "Barbie" again anytime soon. A ban on promotion could be very bad news for San Diego's Comic-Con, upcoming film festivals in places like Venice and Toronto, and scheduled movie premieres like the "Oppenheimer" premiere planned for Monday in New York.
The 75th Emmy Awards, which announced its nominations yesterday, may now be in peril. Organizers have already had discussions about postponing the Sept. 18 ceremony, likely by months.

When Spider-Man Met Jeff Koons: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Our critic spots references to Hilma af Klint and Lichtenstein in "Across the Spider-Verse." Koons, who inspired the film's creative team, gets top billing with an animated survey (before his work is destroyed).
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse," the sequel to the 2018 reimagining of the arachnid-adolescent superhero, doubles down on the first installment with an inventive and magpie visual style. The result is, at least in part, a crash course in art history (literally so, as characters frequently crash into works of art).
While the film is largely rendered in computer-generated animation that speeds by at a dizzying clip, there are moments of slowed, even stunning beauty: backgrounds dissolving with painterly effect, shifting into emotive abstraction reminiscent of, at turns, the work of Kandinsky, Mondrian and Hilma af Klint. New York's cityscape is softened into brushy, Impressionistic swaths. Ben-Day dots stutter across the screen, a nod to the story's comic book source material, but also calling up Roy Lichtenstein's appropriations of the same.
Justin K. Thompson, a director of the film, said the collision of techniques and applications was deliberate. "We wanted to emulate dry brush, watercolor, acrylic," he said. "I looked a lot at the work of Paul Klee, the work of Lyonel Feininger." The experimental films of John Whitney, a pioneer of computer animation, were another inspiration.
There are also a number of more direct allusions to contemporary art. An early set piece in the Guggenheim Museum's Frank Lloyd Wright building allowed the filmmakers gleeful abandon. A version of the perennial Spider-Man villain Vulture that appears as if lifted from a Leonardo da Vinci parchment drawing tumbles through the museum's rotunda, wielding weapons inspired by da Vinci's fanciful and terrifying inventions and causing havoc in what quickly appears to be a Jeff Koons retrospective. The fight scene deploys several of Koons's sculptures of inflatable toys, like "Lobster" (2003) and "Dolphin" (2002), hurled as projectiles. Naturally, a Koons Balloon Dog, his most readily recognizable work, receives top billing.
"When we talked about the Balloon Dog we said, 'What could we do with it? What would be special?"' Thompson told me. Koons, he recalled, "was actually the one who said, 'You know, one thing about the Balloon Dog is it's this thing that has a lot to do with breath. It's filled with human breath. But we've never actually seen the inside of one. What if we cut one open and we could see what was inside?' And we just kind of looked at each other, like, 'But what's inside?' And he said, 'Whatever you want."'
What's inside ended up being a sight gag that follows after Vulture lops off the head of a 12-foot-tall Balloon Dog, from which spill countless smaller Balloon Dog sculptures, satisfying the nagging suspicion that Koons's outsize works are in fact elaborate piñatas. (The scene brought to mind an episode earlier this year, where a collector visiting the Art Wynwood fair in Miami accidentally shattered a 16-inch edition. The film was already well through production.)
"It was moving to me," Koons said on a phone call from Hydra, Greece, "because I always thought of the Balloon Dog as kind of a ritualistic work, something that could have a mythic quality to it, a little bit like a Trojan horse or Venus of Willendorf, where there would be some form of tribal community." (His own balloon Venus did not seem to make the final cut.) Koons considered the Balloon Dog's presence in the film as "truly participating in a larger community where people can rally around it."
The scene, which also features several of Koons's earlier, stranger and less exposed works, like the polychromed wood sculpture "String of Puppies" (1988), from the "Banality" series, the stainless steel bust "Louis XIV" (1986), and several of his 1980s vacuum cleaner assemblages, is a homage to an artist who served as the original, if indirect, influence for the first "Spider-Verse" film's direction. In 2014, while still in an early conceptual phase and at an impasse as to how to create a kind of postmodern version of the deathless hero, Phil Lord, a co-writer of the screenplay, and Christopher Miller, a producer, visited the Koons retrospective at the Whitney Museum. Lord has said the exhibition crystallized their thinking.
"You could look at 'The New,' 'Equilibrium,' 'Luxury & Degradation,' 'Antiquity,' 'Hulk Elvis,' all different bodies of work that possibly seem like this kind of multiverse," Koons offered. "Where you could have things existing at the same time but in different ways."
Whether the deep dive into Koons's oeuvre resonates with casual viewers is another story. As the plot swings between slightly overbearing teen angst and extrapolations into quantum physics -- itself an extended metaphor for the angst-inducing, open-ended possibilities of adolescence -- the art in-jokes feel like a concession to adult aesthetes. ("I think it's a Banksy" is a one-liner recycled from the first film, referring to something that looks nothing like a Banksy. Everyone laughed at the joke at the Upper West Side screening I attended, but not at the Koons stuff.)
The idea that, in an alternative universe, Jeff Koons's career booster took place at the Guggenheim instead of the Whitney is perhaps the most in-joke of them all, something even seasoned art-world insiders might not have fully appreciated. "There was a discussion for many years that I would have my retrospective at the Guggenheim -- it never happened," Koons told me. "So it was wonderful to see."
For his part, Koons gushed about the result: "I think the film is really astonishing, and I think culturally it's playing a very important role for a whole generation of young people to inform them about the possibilities of perception." He went on to say, "I never had seen richer colors -- the reds are phenomenal!" Koons was born in '55 and grew up on Disney. "There was a certain point in the '70s maybe where we saw animation fall off," he said, "and then with Pixar we saw this tremendous leap forward. The film uses that technology as a base but brings back a texture, really the texture of the senses. I mean, it's like the way we perceive a Rembrandt or a Titian."
Asked if he was at all disturbed by seeing representations of his work obliterated by animated superheroes, Koons responded with Zen Buddhist diplomacy. "I care very much about the world. I care about living. I care about existence," he said. "Everything turns to dust. The world around us turns to dust, universes turn to dust. What's important is how we can enjoy the world that we're in, and be able to have the perception of what our future can be. As an artist, it's nice to feel in some way that the fine arts are able to participate within culture."

What to Know About the Actors Strike

The union representing more than 150,000 television and movie actors announced Thursday that it would go on strike at midnight, joining screenwriters who walked out in May and creating Hollywood’s first industrywide shutdown in 63 years.
Here is what you need to know.
Why are the actors and writers striking?
Pay is often at the center of work stoppages, and that is the case here. But the rise of streaming and the challenges created by the pandemic have stressed the studios, many of which are facing financial challenges, as well as actors and writers, who are seeking better pay and new protections in a rapidly changing workplace.
Both actors and screenwriters have demanded increased residual payments (a type of royalty) from streaming services. Streaming series typically have far fewer episodes than television series typically did. And it used to be that if a television series was a hit, actors and writers could count on a long stream of regular residual checks; streaming has changed the system in a way that they say has hurt them. Both groups also want aggressive guardrails around the use of artificial intelligence to preserve jobs.
A-list actors last month signed a letter to guild leadership saying they were ready to strike and calling this moment “an unprecedented inflection point in our industry.”
What is the position of the Hollywood studios?
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents major studios and streamers, has said it offered “historic pay and residual increases” as well as higher caps on pension and health contributions. They also say their offer includes audition protections, a “groundbreaking” proposal on artificial intelligence and other benefits that address the union’s concerns.
The Hollywood studios have also stressed that all the industry upheaval has not been easy for them, either. As moviegoers have been slow to return to cinemas and home viewers have moved from cable and network television to streaming entertainment, many studios have watched their share prices plummet and their profit margins shrink. Some companies have resorted to layoffs or pulled the plug on projects — or both.
What will happen to my TV shows and movies?
It will take a while for filmgoers to notice a change, since most of the movies scheduled for release this year have already been shot. But TV viewers are already seeing the strike’s effects, and if it drags on, popular shows could see their next seasons delayed.
Late-night shows are already airing reruns because of the writers’ strike, and the vast majority of TV and film productions have already shut down or paused production. Big name shows like “Yellowjackets,” “Severance” and “Stranger Things” halted work after the writers’ strike began; it is not yet clear if their upcoming seasons will be delayed.

Actors Join Writers on Strike, Grinding Studios to a Halt

LOS ANGELES — The Hollywood actors’ union approved a strike on Thursday for the first time in 43 years, bringing the $134 billion American movie and television business to a halt over anger about pay and fears of a tech-dominated future.
The leaders of SAG-AFTRA, the union representing 160,000 television and movie actors, announced the strike after negotiations with studios over a new contract collapsed, with streaming services and artificial intelligence at the center of the standoff. On Friday, the actors will join screenwriters, who walked off the job in May, on picket lines in New York, Los Angeles and the dozens of other American cities where scripted shows and movies are made.
Actors and screenwriters had not been on strike at the same time since 1960, when Marilyn Monroe was still starring in films and Ronald Reagan was the head of the actors’ union. Dual strikes pit more than 170,000 workers against old-line studios like Disney, Universal, Sony and Paramount, as well as tech juggernauts like Netflix, Amazon and Apple.
“I am shocked by the way the people that we have been in business with are treating us!” Fran Drescher, the president of SAG-AFTRA, as the actors’ union is known, said at a news conference on Thursday in Los Angeles. “How far apart we are on so many things. How they plead poverty, that they’re losing money left and right when giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their CEOs. It is disgusting. Shame on them!”
Shaking her fists in anger, Drescher noted that “the entire business model has been changed” by streaming and that artificial intelligence would soon change it more. “This is a moment in history — a moment of truth,” she said. “At some point, you have to say, ‘No, we’re not going to take this anymore.’”
Many of the actors’ demands mirror those of the writers, who belong to the Writers Guild of America. Both unions say they are trying to ensure living wages for workaday members, in particular those making movies or television shows for streaming services.
Screenwriters are afraid studios will use AI to generate scripts. Actors worry that the technology could be used to create digital replicas of their likenesses (or that performances could be digitally altered) without payment or approval.
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of Hollywood companies, said it had worked to reach a reasonable deal at a difficult time for an industry upended by the streaming revolution, which the pandemic sped up.
“The union has regrettably chosen a path that will lead to financial hardship for countless thousands of people who depend on the industry,” the alliance said in a news release that outlined 14 areas where studios had offered “historic” contract improvements. Those included, according to the alliance, an 11% pay increase in the contract’s first year for background actors, stand-ins and photo doubles and a 76% increase in residual payments for “high-budget” shows that stream overseas.
The alliance added in a separate statement: “We are deeply disappointed that SAG-AFTRA has decided to walk away from negotiations. This is the union’s choice, not ours.”
Behind the scenes, studio executives responded to Drescher’s fury in varying ways. Some said they had underestimated her ability to lead the sometimes-fractious actors’ union — discounting her as little more than the cartoonish figure she played on “The Nanny” for six seasons in the 1990s. Others continued to mock her as giving an Academy Award-caliber performance at the union’s news conference.
Although Hollywood had been bracing for a writers’ strike since the beginning of the year — screenwriters have walked out eight times over the past seven decades, most recently in 2007 — the actors’ uncharacteristic resolve caught senior executives and producers off guard.
The actors last staged a major walkout in 1980, when the economic particulars of a still-nascent boom in home video rentals and sales was a sticking point. Their latest action is part of a resurgent labor movement, particularly in California, where hotel workers, school bus drivers, teachers and cafeteria staff have all gone on strike for some duration in recent months.
The first distress signal for the studios came in early June when roughly 65,000 members of the actors’ union voted to authorize a strike. Almost 98% of the voters supported the authorization, a figure that narrowly eclipsed the writers’ margin.
Still, studio negotiators went into the talks feeling optimistic. They were taken aback when they saw the list of proposals from the union — it totaled 48 pages, nearly triple the size of the list during their last negotiations in 2020, according to two people familiar with the proposals, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential talks.
Then in late June, more than 1,000 actors, including Meryl Streep, John Leguizamo, Jennifer Lawrence, Constance Wu and Ben Stiller, signed a letter to guild leadership, declaring pointedly that “we are prepared to strike.”
The Hollywood studios will now need to navigate a two-front labor war with no modern playbook to consult. There are many open questions, including whether the actors and the writers may demand that future negotiations with the studios be conducted in tandem. One guild that will not be included: the Directors Guild of America, which ratified a contract last month.
The actors’ walkout will provide an immediate boon to the striking writers, who have been walking picket lines for more than 70 days; the Writers Guild has yet to return to bargaining with the studios. Now those picket lines are likely to be raucous and star-studded spectacles — struggling thespians still trying to get a foothold next to A-listers with bodyguards who are paid $20 million or more per movie role.
The strikes are the latest monumental blow to an entertainment industry that has been rocked in recent years by the pandemic and sweeping technological shifts.
The Hollywood studios have watched their share prices nose-dive and their profit margins shrink as viewership for cable and network television — as well as box office returns — has collapsed in the wake of the explosive growth of streaming entertainment.
Many companies have resorted to layoffs, as well as purging series from their streaming services, all in the name of trying to increase profit margins and satisfy recalcitrant investors. Studio executives had already put the brakes on ordering new television series last year as their streaming services continued to burn through cash.
In an interview on CNBC on Thursday morning, Disney’s CEO, Robert Iger, said that given all the “disruptive forces” in the business, “this is worst time in the world to add to that disruption.”
Barry Diller, the veteran media executive, said in an interview that the recent upheaval in the industry had caused distress for both sides.
“You have a complete change in the underlying economics of the entertainment business that it previously held for certainly the last 50 years, if not the last 100 years,” he said. “Everything was basically in balance under the hegemony of five major studios, and then, oh, my God, along come the tech companies in Netflix, Amazon and Apple and the fast, transformative things that came out of COVID. The result of which is you have a business that’s just completely upended.”
After the strike announcement, the union issued rules for its members. Along with not being able to work in front of the camera, they will not be permitted to promote current projects. That includes attending Comic-Con, film festivals and movie premieres.
That means actors will not be able to promote movies during an all-important stretch for the summer box office, when big-budget films like “Barbie,” “Oppenheimer” and “Haunted Mansion” are released.
Some of those promotional opportunities have already disappeared: Late-night shows like “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” and “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” have been running only repeat episodes during the writers’ strike.
The effects of the dual strikes should be noticeable to viewers within a couple of months. Unless there is an immediate resolution to the labor disputes, the ABC fall schedule, for instance, will debut with nightly lineups of reality series and game shows — including “Celebrity Wheel of Fortune,” “Dancing With the Stars” and “Judge Steve Harvey” — as well as repeats of “Abbott Elementary.”
If the strikes drag into the fall, blockbuster films scheduled to be released next summer, like “Deadpool 3,” could be delayed.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Its final season earned 27 nods, the most of any drama, while "Ted Lasso" got 21, the most of any comedy. But the writers' strike could delay the ceremony, planned for September.
"Succession," HBO's operatic saga about a media dynasty and a two-time best drama winner, scored 27 Emmy nominations for its farewell season on Wednesday morning, the biggest haul of any series.
That tally helped propel HBO and its accompanying streaming service, Max, to one of its strongest years, with 127 nominations, the most of any network. Netflix finished in second place with 103.
HBO dominated the best drama category, with nods not only for "Succession" but for the second season of "The White Lotus" as well as for "The Last of Us," its popular video game adaptation, and "House of the Dragon," its "Game of Thrones" prequel. It was the first time since 1992 that a single network landed four nominations in the category.
"Ted Lasso," the Apple TV+ awards favorite, notched 21 nominations, the most of any comedy, for its third season, which is believed to be its last. The race for best comedy is shaping up as a showdown between "Ted Lasso," "The Bear," an FX show on Hulu, and ABC's "Abbott Elementary," which would be the first network show to win the category in nine years.
Though Emmy nominations day is normally a joyous affair for the television industry to toast the best in the business, the timing of this year's announcement was decidedly awkward.
More than 11,000 television and feature film writers have been on strike for 72 days. The union representing 160,000 actors has been in negotiations with the major Hollywood studios for over a month -- with its contract expiring later Wednesday, mere hours after the nominations are announced. Organizers have privately concluded that if the strike -- or, worse, a pair of strikes -- continues for another two or three weeks, they will have to postpone the September ceremony, likely by months.
Frank Scherma, the chair of the Television Academy, which organizes the Emmys, alluded to the labor disputes before presenting the nominations. "We hope the guild negotiations can come to an equitable and swift resolution," he said. As he signed off, he noted that the ceremony was "currently planned" for Monday, Sept. 18.
Although Netflix ran a bit short on top competitors in the drama and comedy categories, the streaming giant can at least count on having the two top favorites in the Emmys' limited series category: Ryan Murphy's "Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story," which scored 13 nominations overall, and "Beef," which became a hit for the streamer.
"The Crown," Netflix's lavish chronicle of the British royal family, and the best drama winner at the 2021 Emmys, was also nominated in the category this year -- though some critics had a hard time warming up to the show's fifth season, which featured a new cast.
The moment of triumph for HBO is coming at a time of transition for the network, which since last year has been run by a debt-ridden parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery. The network is now part of a streaming service that removed its call letters (bye HBO Max, hello Max). And, for the first time, HBO is in the process of licensing revered older series -- "Insecure," and soon "Six Feet Under," "Band of Brothers" and "True Blood" -- to its archrival, Netflix, in an attempt by Warner Bros. Discovery to drum up cash.
HBO had the three most nominated shows: "Succession" (27), "The Last of Us" (24) and "The White Lotus" (23). The race for best actor in a drama is shaping up as yet another "Succession" Roy family competition, pitting the one-time winner Jeremy Strong against the two-time nominee Kieran Culkin and the four-time nominee (and one-time winner, for a 2000 mini-series) Brian Cox. And HBO completely swept the best supporting actor in a drama category: eight out of eight, all split between performers from "Succession" and "The White Lotus."
Of course, the last time a single network earned four nominations in the best drama category, 31 years ago, it came home empty-handed. It was in 1992, when NBC landed nominations for "I'll Fly Away," "L.A. Law," "Law & Order" and "Quantum Leap." All four series lost to that year's winner, "Northern Exposure," from CBS.
This year's best actor in a comedy category will pit Jason Sudeikis, who has won two years in a row for playing the title role in "Ted Lasso," against Jeremy Allen White, who plays an ambitious and anxious chef in "The Bear." The other nominees in the category are Bill Hader for "Barry," Jason Segel for "Shrinking" and Martin Short for "Only Murders in the Building."
Award prognosticators believe that Quinta Brunson could be on a glide path to winning for "Abbott Elementary." Brunson took writing honors at the Emmys last year for her good-natured ABC workplace comedy, and would be the first Black woman to win best actress in a comedy since Isabel Sanford won in 1981 for "The Jeffersons." She will face Christina Applegate from "Dead to Me," Rachel Brosnahan for "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel," Natasha Lyonne for "Poker Face" and Jenna Ortega for "Wednesday."
This year the Emmys will crown a new king of late night. John Oliver, whose HBO show, "Last Week Tonight," was named the best variety talk show seven years in a row, has been moved to a new Emmy category this year -- outstanding scripted variety series.
That gives an inside track to hosts like Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel or Seth Meyers to win for best talk series for their current late-night shows for the first time. (Colbert's old Comedy Central series, "The Colbert Report," won best variety series twice, in 2013 and 2014.) Trevor Noah, who recently left "The Daily Show," received a nomination for his final months in the chair, and Noah's predecessor, Jon Stewart, a former runaway winner at the Emmys, was nominated for his Apple TV+ series, "The Problem With Jon Stewart." (Jimmy Fallon's "The Tonight Show" has not been nominated in the category since 2016.)
In the scripted variety series category, Oliver will now compete against "Saturday Night Live," the show that has won more Emmys than any other series. "S.N.L." represents stiff competition, but there are signs of weakness for the NBC stalwart. After going on a very strong Emmy run during the Trump years, "S.N.L." has garnered just nine Emmy nominations for each of the past two years. That was its lowest tally since 2015. "A Black Lady Sketch Show," which was recently canceled by HBO, was also nominated.
There were a number of performers who earned multiple nominations. Pedro Pascal, the star of "The Last of Us," was nominated for best actor in a drama, as well as best guest actor in a comedy (for his hosting duties on "Saturday Night Live") and for best narrator (for CNN's "Patagonia: Life on the Edge of the World"). Those are Pascal's first Emmy nominations.
Other notable multiple honorees include Melanie Lynskey, who was nominated for best actress in a drama series ("Yellowjackets") and best guest actress in a drama ("The Last of Us"). Murray Bartlett, last year's best supporting actor in a limited series for "The White Lotus," was also nominated twice: for best guest actor in a drama series for "The Last Of Us" (Nick Offerman, who played Bartlett's romantic partner, was also nominated) and best supporting actor in a limited series for "Welcome to Chippendales."

Some Inexplicable Box-Checking on Voter Ballots: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The 75th Primetime Emmy nominations proceeded mostly as anticipated on Wednesday, but there were a few surprises.
With minor exceptions, the major categories were filled in the expected ways when the 2023 Primetime Emmys nominations were announced on Wednesday. Some surprises cropped up further down the page, where the members of the Television Academy apparently started checking off every name they saw from favored shows like "Ted Lasso" and "The White Lotus."
Snub: Taylor Sheridan
He may be the most successful maker of television currently working, but Sheridan gets no respect at the Emmys. His monster hit "Yellowstone" continued to be shut out (it has received one Primetime Emmy nomination, for production design in 2021), and his other series "1923," "Tulsa King" and "The Mayor of Kingstown" received one nod among them, for stunt coordination in "Tulsa King." Especially galling: no nomination for Helen Mirren as the matriarch in the period western "1923."
Surprise: 'Obi-Wan Kenobi'
A greater acceptance of genre shows fueled by existing intellectual property had been anticipated, and "Andor" and "The Last of Us" fulfilled expectations with their nominations for best drama. But it was a mild shock to see a second Disney+ "Star Wars" show (along with "Andor") break through in the limited-series category. Ewan McGregor, who reprised his Obi-Wan role from the prequel films, apparently draws a lot of good will. The nomination for "Obi-Wan" came at the expense of more weighty series like "Black Bird" or "A Small Light."
Snub: Comedy
The long, slow fade of traditional norms of TV humor was apparent during the announcement of the best comedy nominees, during which the clips for "Abbott Elementary," "Barry," "The Bear," "Jury Duty," "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel," "Only Murders in the Building," "Ted Lasso" and "Wednesday" contained no jokes and barely any laughs. The merger of TV comedy into satirical drama is just about complete.
Surprise: 'Jury Duty'
Freevee's mash-up of sitcom and reality mind game drew a lot of attention, but that wasn't expected to translate into nominations for comedy series, writing and supporting actor (James Marsden, playing himself).
Snub: 'What We Do in the Shadows'
FX's rollicking vampire comedy received four nominations in technical categories, but failed to get a nod for comedy series, an honor it had garnered in two of its first three seasons.
Surprise: Kumail Nanjiani
Nanjiani's performance as the Indian immigrant and male-stripping entrepreneur Steve Banerjee in Hulu's "Welcome to Chippendales" was well reviewed, but Steve Carell (for FX on Hulu's "The Patient") and Jesse Eisenberg (for FX on Hulu's "Fleishman Is in Trouble") were considered stronger contenders for best actor in a limited series.
Snubs: Harrison Ford, Steve Martin, Fiona Shaw, Imelda Staunton
You can't feel too bad for people with careers as long and successful as these four have had, but all were expected to hear their names called: Ford for comedy supporting actor in "Shrinking" (and, possibly, drama lead actor in "1923"); Martin for comedy lead actor in "Only Murders in the Building" (where his castmate Martin Short was nominated); Shaw for drama guest actress in "Andor"; and -- probably the most notable omission -- Staunton for drama lead actress in "The Crown."
Surprise: 'The White Lotus' supporting cast
Sabrina Impacciatore, Theo James, Will Sharpe and Simona Tabasco all received unexpected supporting actress and actor nominations, in categories where more well-known and quite worthy performers like Giancarlo Esposito ("Better Call Saul"), John Lithgow ("The Old Man") and, particularly, Carol Burnett ("Better Call Saul") were expected to be on the list.
Surprise: 'Last Week Tonight With John Oliver'
OK, no one was actually surprised that Oliver's top-flight topicomic series was nominated in the scripted variety series category. But there was at least a little more room than usual for doubt, after the show was moved out of the talk category that it had dominated for the past seven years. (The move opened up room in talk series for Oliver's old boss, the host of "The Problem With Jon Stewart.")

DeSantis Is Facing A Tougher Fox News: [National Desk]

Author: Nehamas, Nicholas; Haberman, Maggie

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Florida governor has faced tough questions and critical coverage lately from Fox News and other conservative outlets, in a sign of growing skepticism.
In March, as Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida laid the groundwork for his presidential run, he joined the Fox News host Brian Kilmeade to play a nationally televised game of catch on his hometown baseball field outside Tampa.
The questions Mr. DeSantis faced were as relaxed as the tosses.
"Locker room gets you ready for the press, right?" Mr. Kilmeade asked. "Because your teammates, if they like you a lot, they rip you all the time."
At the time, Mr. DeSantis was seen by many in the Republican Party as the strongest possible alternative to former President Donald J. Trump, who had repeatedly attacked the network and had seen his relationship with its owner, Rupert Murdoch, evaporate.
Four months later, with Mr. DeSantis's campaign having failed to immediately catch fire against Mr. Trump, Fox News is not taking it quite so easy on Mr. DeSantis anymore.
Over the last week, he has confronted noticeably tougher questions in interviews with two of the network's hosts, Will Cain and Maria Bartiromo, who pressed him on his anemic poll numbers and early campaign struggles. It was a striking shift for a network that for years has offered Mr. DeSantis a safe space as a congressman and a governor.
Other outlets in Mr. Murdoch's media empire have also been slightly less friendly of late.
A recent editorial in The Wall Street Journal criticized a tough immigration bill that Mr. DeSantis signed into law in May. And The New York Post, which hailed the governor as "DeFuture" on its front page last year, has covered his lagging poll numbers, as well as the backlash to a video his campaign shared that was condemned as homophobic.
Mr. DeSantis was always bound to be subjected to more scrutiny as a candidate, rather than a candidate in waiting. His decision to challenge Mr. Trump -- who remains a favorite of Fox News's audience and some of its hosts, including Ms. Bartiromo -- was also certain to result in sideswipes from fellow Republicans.
But taken together, the signs of skepticism from previously friendly conservative megaphones suggest that Mr. Murdoch's media empire might now be reassessing him as the early shine comes off his campaign.
Even if Mr. Murdoch's outlets as a whole are less determinative of outcomes in Republican politics than they once were, they remain influential, and G.O.P. candidates and major party donors still pay close attention to their coverage.
Whether Mr. Murdoch wants to see Mr. DeSantis as the nominee is unclear. Some of Mr. DeSantis's moves -- like his ongoing punitive battle with Disney -- are unlikely to have pleased the business-minded Mr. Murdoch, who nearly a decade ago called for federal officials to make immigration reform a priority.
The media mogul likes to watch political races play out, even live-tweeting reactions to one of the Republican presidential debates during the 2016 election. Mr. Murdoch has privately told people that he would still like to see Gov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia enter the race, according to a person with knowledge of the remarks. And he has made clear in private discussions over the last two years that he thinks Mr. Trump, despite his popularity with Fox News viewers, is unhealthy for the Republican Party.
A spokesman for Mr. Murdoch and a spokesman for Fox did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Mr. DeSantis's campaign declined to comment. Privately, his advisers say that tougher questions were always expected and that the governor plans to continue holding interviews with Fox hosts who may challenge him.
Republican voters view Mr. DeSantis favorably overall, but he has been unable to meaningfully narrow the polling gap between him and Mr. Trump since entering the race, even as he remains the former president's leading challenger. Mr. DeSantis has also continued to show an awkward side in unscripted exchanges where he is challenged -- a contrast with Mr. Trump, a no-holds barred campaigner who seems to enjoy combative interviews.
The tide has not completely shifted. On Monday, The Wall Street Journal's editorial page took a new jab at Mr. Trump for adjusting his policy positions depending on which audience he is addressing, and gave Mr. DeSantis a slight boost by comparing him favorably.
For Fox, navigating its coverage of Mr. DeSantis, Mr. Trump and an already bitter Republican presidential primary race is just one challenge.
This spring, the network paid dearly for its airing of Mr. Trump's false election claims, settling a defamation lawsuit related to its coverage of the 2020 presidential contest for a staggering $ 787.5 million. Further legal dangers lie ahead.
Less than a week after the settlement, Fox dismissed Tucker Carlson, its most popular prime-time host, in an earthquake for the conservative media ecosystem. The network now faces persistent concerns about dipping ratings and upstart competitors that are eager to claw away Fox viewers who want a more pro-Trump viewpoint.
Although Mr. Trump still appears on Fox News, his relationship with the network remains hostile, to the extent that people close to him say there is little chance he will participate in the first Republican presidential debate, which Fox News is hosting next month. (Mr. Trump, who leads in national polls by roughly 30 percentage points, also does not want to give his rivals a chance to attack him in person, those people said.)
Mr. DeSantis, who typically shuns one-on-one interviews with mainstream political reporters, has a long and positive history with Fox News.
As a congressman, he co-hosted the show "Outnumbered" several times. In 2018, he announced his run for governor on "Fox & Friends." During the coronavirus pandemic, Sean Hannity of Fox News praised Mr. DeSantis in an interview, saying: "I'm an idiot. I should be in Florida. You should be my governor."
And after declaring his candidacy for president in a glitch-ridden livestream on Twitter seven weeks ago, Mr. DeSantis immediately went on Fox for an interview, although the network did poke fun at his technical difficulties.
Mr. Trump himself raged earlier in the year about what he perceived as Fox's excessively friendly treatment of Mr. DeSantis. "Just watching Fox News. They are sooo bad," Mr. Trump wrote on his Truth Social site in May. "They are desperately pushing DeSanctimonious who, regardless, is dropping like a rock."
He has also taken digs at features in The New York Post, including one in which the writer Salena Zito did a lengthy interview with Mr. DeSantis in his hometown, Dunedin, Fla. -- an article Mr. Trump denounced as a "puff piece." (The Post, once one of Mr. Trump's favorite papers, has ripped into him.)
Mr. Trump was undoubtedly more pleased last Thursday when Mr. Cain, the Fox host, pressed Mr. DeSantis on his poll numbers, asking the governor why he was so far behind.
In response, Mr. DeSantis suggested that he was being unfairly attacked both by the "corporate media" and, somewhat incongruously, by the president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who has criticized him for his hard-line stances on immigration.
"So I think if you look at all these people that are responsible for a lot of the ills in our society, they're targeting me as the person they don't want to see as the candidate," explained Mr. DeSantis, adding that his campaign had "just started."
Mr. Cain tried again, saying that he believed Mr. DeSantis had "done a wonderful job" as governor but that "there are those that say there's something about you that's not connecting, for whatever reason, not connecting with the voter."
Mr. DeSantis wove around the question and noted that his campaign had raised $ 20 million in its first six weeks.
"We're in the process of building out a great organization, and I think we're going to be on the ground in all these early states," he said.
Mr. Cain is no dyed-in-the-wool Trump supporter. He has talked about voting against Mr. Trump in 2016. But when Mr. DeSantis joined Ms. Bartiromo, who relentlessly pushed the former president's conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, for an interview on Sunday, he surely expected to be challenged.
"You've done a great job pushing back against 'woke,' we know that," Ms. Bartiromo said after allowing Mr. DeSantis to hit his usual talking points for several minutes. "But I'm wondering what's going on with your campaign. There was a lot of optimism about you running for president earlier in the year."
Mr. DeSantis forced out a laugh as Ms. Bartiromo read negative headlines about his campaign. He then jumped into a rebuttal that focused on his efforts to build strong organizing operations in Iowa and New Hampshire.
"Maria, these are narratives," he said. "The media does not want me to be the nominee."

Coco Lee, 48, Best Known for Songs From 'Crouching Tiger' and 'Mulan': [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A pop star across Asia by her early 20s, Ms. Lee reached international recognition with an Oscar-nominated song in 2001.
Coco Lee, a Chinese American singer and songwriter best known for performing an Oscar-nominated song in the hit film "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," died on Wednesday in a hospital in Hong Kong. She was 48.
The cause was suicide, according to a statement from her sisters, Carol and Nancy Lee. Ms. Lee was taken to the hospital on Sunday after she attempted suicide at her home, they said.
"Coco had been suffering from depression for a few years, but her condition deteriorated drastically over the last few months," her sisters wrote. "Although Coco sought professional help and did her best to fight depression, sadly that demon inside of her took the better of her."
Ms. Lee had built a successful career as a pop singer in Asia, but she was best known to American audiences for singing "A Love Before Time" in Ang Lee's stylish action movie "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," released in 2000. The song, with music by Jorge Calandrelli and Tan Dun and lyrics by James Schamus, was nominated for an Oscar as best original song, and she performed it in front of a television audience of millions at the Academy Awards ceremony in March 2001.
"Combining the flavor and texture of Eastern music with the orchestral color and sensitive lyrics of Western culture, the magic of this stunningly beautiful film is truly realized in this evocative love ballad," the actress Julia Stiles said as she introduced Ms. Lee's performance.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Ms. Lee's recording career began after she finished as the runner-up in a singing competition hosted by the television broadcaster TVB in Hong Kong in 1993. She had recently graduated from high school at the time and had entered the competition on a whim, she told The San Francisco Chronicle in 2000.
"I was timid as a kid," she said. "I would hide in the bathroom and sing in the shower. I always predicted my older sister Nancy would be the singer. She's beautiful, talented, and she's got nice legs. I had no idea it would be me."
Her success in the TVB contest led to the release of her debut album by a Taiwanese record label in 1994. "My goal in the singing business is not to stay in one place," she told The South China Morning Post in 1997, saying she wanted to work in Asia and the U.S.
In 1999, Ms. Lee released her first full English-language album, "Just No Other Way," which featured pop and R&B songs. One track, "Before I Fall in Love," was included on the soundtrack for the 1999 Julia Roberts film "Runaway Bride."
Ms. Lee's career expanded beyond music. She voiced the lead character in the Mandarin version of the 1998 animated Disney film "Mulan," set in imperial China, and sang its theme song, "Reflection."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Ms. Lee, who was born on Jan. 17, 1975, in Hong Kong, moved to the United States and attended middle and high school in San Francisco, where she was crowned Miss Teen Chinatown in 1991. She briefly attended the University of California at Irvine, intending to study biology and become a doctor, but dropped out after her freshman year, she told The Chronicle.
In their statement, Ms. Lee's sisters noted that this year marked the 30th anniversary of the launch of her singing career. Ms. Lee was "known to have worked tirelessly to open up a new world for Chinese singers in the international music scene," they wrote, highlighting her "excellent live performances."
In addition to her sisters, her survivors include her husband, Bruce Rockowitz, and two stepdaughters.
Ms. Lee's last single, "Tragic," was released in February. In a social media post at the end of 2022, she acknowledged having had an "incredibly difficult year" but encouraged her followers to spread positivity and "inspire people."

Full text: Tejal Rao uses her experience as a restaurant critic to write about food served onscreen.
Italian beef sandwiches, fruit-studded buns and Flamin' Hot Cheetos have been top of mind for Tejal Rao lately.
As a critic at large for The New York Times, Ms. Rao covers the culture of food in the United States. In recent months, she has used her years of experience as a restaurant critic to write about food -- flamin' hot and otherwise -- and its presence in film and television.
"When I write a restaurant review, I have to eat and experience the restaurant with my whole body to see it clearly and talk about it with any authority and clarity," she said in an interview. "With film and television, I tend to unravel and investigate the pleasures of those works in a similar way. I have to go squishy and really feel something first if I want to write about it."
Ms. Rao shared her thoughts on food in popular films like "Flamin' Hot," a dramatized biopic streaming on Hulu and Disney+ about the Frito-Lay employee who claims he invented Flamin' Hot Cheetos, and shows like "The Bear," an FX series airing on Hulu that captures the inner workings of a restaurant kitchen in Chicago. She also explained what onscreen trends can tell us about the state of food culture right now. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.
How would you describe food culture right now?
We tend to talk about food culture as if it's one big homogeneous thing, but there are so many different trends and ideas within it. I do, however, think there's this level of absurdity and weirdness in food culture now. I'm really enjoying the Grimace milkshake trend on TikTok. When there are food trends on social media that have to do with branded products, I tend to think the companies are behind them. But this one is just so grotesque and so horrifying, so silly and repulsive, I think it's almost beautiful for that very reason.
What is it about "The Bear" that has resonated with viewers?
It's an exceptionally well-made show about this brutal space that we usually see glamorized or idealized in some way in film and TV. But it's also grappling with themes that so many of us are interested in right now -- our relationships to work and desires for more equitable workplaces, for example. There's also the timeless question: Do we have to suffer or make other people suffer to create good art and do good work?
Audiences are used to seeing the restaurant kitchen as it's depicted in reality television, which is so far removed from reality. The new season of "The Bear" seems closer to reality, at least at first, though I wrote about the hopeless idealism and optimism of the second season.
Can you tell me about your decision to cover the show "Succession" and the role food plays in it?
When the final season was airing, I had a conversation with my editor; I really wanted to write about the show, but I couldn't because no one was eating any food in it. Then I realized that was where the story was: in the restriction and control -- or the lack of it. Every scene involving food was so strange and toxic, and it turned out to be a pretty fun way to explore power dynamics on the show.
What compelled you to write about "Flamin' Hot" ?
There are so many films about consumer products at the moment, and this one was based on the memoir of a man in Southern California who claimed to have invented Flamin' Hot Cheetos. That claim was debunked by an investigation in The Los Angeles Times, and though it still could have made for a great movie, "Flamin' Hot" ended up leaning on identity, food and race in ways that seemed really manipulative. Honestly, it made me a little angry.
You recently covered "The Menu" and "Fresh," and wrote that those films parody the "horrors of rich-people food." What do those films tell us about high-end dining culture?
There's fun and silliness in food culture, but there's also a lot of darkness and inequity. Sometimes the horror genre is the only place where you can explore those themes. In "The Menu," a toxic celebrity chef is at the center of the story, and the rest of the cooks and servers don't really exist as individuals. That's where the horror begins to unfold, in how much diners are willing to ignore so they can just enjoy their dinner.
I have to ask: What did you think of the portrayal of a restaurant critic in "The Menu" as a restaurant critic yourself?
It's always fun to see a ridiculous, self-important, super old-school restaurant critic in a movie. You can tell that she loves to hear herself talk, to take credit for other people's success. But the movie leans on a lot of these archetypes: the finance bro, the critic, the toxic chef, the couple that no longer makes eye contact with each other. They're all the most cartoonish versions possible of those kinds of people.
I've always thought that food writing was tricky because you write about food that readers can't taste. Is writing about food in film and TV even more challenging?
When I write a restaurant review, I might be writing about a dish that is served differently the following week, or an experience with a server who isn't there by the time a reader decides to visit. In some ways, film and TV are more accessible to readers because they can see the same exact thing that I just saw -- even if they don't see it in exactly the same way.

In Song, Taking a Big Bite Out of Former Paramours: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The pop singer's new single dismantles a former paramour who was entranced by fame, borrowing a tactic from Swift's career-shifting "Dear John."
On "Drivers License," one of the great singles of the 2020s, Olivia Rodrigo has been played for a fool by an ex, but the song -- pulsing, parched, destitute -- remains centered in her pathos. She may have been abandoned, but the person who did the damage is still an object of, if not exactly affection, then obsession: "I still hear your voice in the traffic/We're laughing/Over all the noise." At the song's conclusion, she is alone, and lonely.
That was the Rodrigo from two and a half years ago, when she was reintroducing herself to the world as a human after a stretch as a Disney actress automaton. The Olivia Rodrigo who appears on "Vampire," the first single from her forthcoming second album, has now lived through some things. Her sweetness has curdled.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"Vampire" is nervy and anxious, a tripartite study in defiance that begins with Elton John-esque piano balladry à la "Drivers License" -- a head fake in the direction of naïveté.
But Rodrigo knows better now, or at least knows more: Rapid stardom has both bolstered and cloistered her. "I loved you truly," she sings, deadpan, then almost cackles the next line, "You gotta laugh at the stupidity." The song continues in this vein, through a boisterous up-tempo midsection and a rowdy, theatrical conclusion. Her subject matter -- romantic disappointment, being left in the lurch -- is the same, but the stakes are much greater now.
"I used to think I was smart/But you made me look so naïve," she sings. It is the sort of insider-outsider awareness that can only come from being both the object and the subject at once -- powerful enough to author your own story, vulnerable enough to fall prey to someone else's wiles.
It is, in short, Rodrigo's "Dear John."
Over a decade after its release, "Dear John" remains one of the most powerful songs in Taylor Swift's catalog, and also among the most idiosyncratic. Purportedly about a dismal romantic engagement with John Mayer, it is produced in the style of Mayer, dressed liberally with blues guitar noodling.
Lyrically, it's not only astute, it's vicious. Swift begins with a similar unjaundiced shrug -- "Well, maybe it's me/And my blind optimism to blame" -- then goes on to surgically, savagely disassemble her foe: "You are an expert at sorry and keeping lines blurry/Never impressed by me acing your tests."
"Dear John" appeared on "Speak Now," Swift's third album, released when she was 20. It wasn't a single, but it was one of a pair of songs on the album -- the other was "Mean," about a fierce critic of her artistry -- in which Swift began creatively and publicly reckoning with the public version of herself. Her earlier songwriting felt winningly insular, almost provocatively emotionally intimate. But "Dear John" announced Swift as a bolder and riskier performer and songwriter, one unafraid of using stardom as her ink, and who understood that the celebrity most people knew provided as much fodder as her inner life.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Rodrigo is 20 now, and "Guts," due in September, will be her second album. And while "Drivers License" and its fallout became tabloid fodder, the public narrative wasn't encoded into the song itself.
"Vampire" changes that. Rodrigo's target here is someone attempting to be glamorous, or perhaps glamour itself: "Look at you, cool guy, you got it/I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes/Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise."
Perhaps the song is about the Los Angeles nightlife fixture Zack Bia, one of Rodrigo's rumored partners -- if so, the structural shift from the first to second part might be pointed -- that's when the music becomes coffeehouse EDM, possibly a veiled allusion to Bia's emergent career as a producer and D.J., and an echo of the Mayer-ian blues-pop Swift channeled on "Dear John."
The relationship itself, Rodrigo learns, is a transaction, too. "The way you sold me for parts/As you sunk your teeth into me," she yowls, before anointing her ex with the coldest moniker imaginable: "fame [expletive]." That insult usually begins with "star" rather than "fame," but Rodrigo knows that the condition of fame is far more toxic than any one person, and that someone who craves it is perhaps uninterested in personhood at all.
On "Drivers License," Rodrigo still saw the other woman as an enemy, or source of tension, but now on "Vampire," she understands what the lines of allegiance truly are, marking an emergent feminist streak. Here, she finds kinship with her ex's other partners, and lambastes herself for thinking she ever was the exception: "Every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news/You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called 'em crazy too."
There's an echo here of Swift's realization on "Dear John" that she, too, is closer kin to the other aggrieved women than to her ex: "You'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand/And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said/'Run as fast as you can."'
After sweeping past it for most of her career, Swift has just begun revisiting this moment -- last month, she played "Dear John" live for the first time in over 11 years, at one of the Minneapolis stops of her Eras Tour. That's likely because Swift's rerecording of "Speak Now," part of her ongoing early album reclamation project, is being released this week.
But she also used the moment to both reflect on her maturation, and to urge her devoted, sometimes ferocious fans not to live in, or dwell on, her past.
"I'm 33 years old. I don't care about anything that happened to me when I was 19 except the songs I wrote and the memories we made together," she said from the stage. "So what I'm trying to tell you is, I'm not putting this album out so you should feel the need to defend me on the internet against someone you think I might have written a song about 14 billion years ago."
When Swift began reporting on her own fame on "Dear John," it had the secondary effect of activating phalanxes of fans who went to war on her behalf, too. But over the course of the past decade, something interesting happened: The battle became theirs more than hers. They hold on to her wrongs with pitbull-like grip, ensuring, in a way, that Swift can't fully grow up.
So if "Dear John" is a creative guidepost for "Vampire," this cautionary note offers a suggestion of what might come from it: a call to arms, a hardening of your outer shell, a conflagration that burns long after you light the match and walk away.

G.O.P. Finds It Hard to Tie Biden to Culture Wars: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Despite his alliance with abortion-rights supporters and L.G.B.T.Q. advocates, the president has deftly avoided becoming enmeshed in battles over hotly contested social issues.
President Biden memorably jumped the gun on Barack Obama in endorsing same-sex marriage more than a decade ago, but at a June fund-raiser near San Francisco, he couldn't recall the letters L.G.B.T.Q.
And even as the Democratic Party makes the fight for abortion rights central to its political message, Mr. Biden last week declared himself "not big on abortion."
At a moment when the American political parties are trading fierce fire from the trenches of a war over social and cultural policy, the president is staying out of the fray.
White, male, 80 years old and not particularly up-to-date on the language of the left, Mr. Biden has largely avoided becoming enmeshed in contemporary battles over gender, abortion and other hotly contested social issues -- even as he does things like hosting what he called "the largest Pride Month celebration ever held at the White House."
Republicans have tried to pull him in, but appear to recognize the difficulty: When G.O.P. presidential candidates vow to end what they derisively call "woke" culture, they often aim their barbs not directly at Mr. Biden but at big corporations like Disney and BlackRock or the vast "administrative state" of the federal government. Republican strategists say most of their party's message on abortion and transgender issues is aimed at primary voters, while Mr. Biden is seen as far more vulnerable in a general election on the economy, crime and immigration.
Mr. Biden's armor against cultural attacks might seem unlikely for a president who has strongly advocated for L.G.B.T.Q. people, the leader of a party whose fortunes ride on the wave of abortion politics, and a man who owes his presidency to unbending support from Black Democratic primary voters.
Yet despite adopting positions over the years that pushed Democrats -- and then the country -- to embrace more liberal attitudes on social issues, Mr. Biden has kept himself at arm's length from elements of his party that could pose him political problems. In June, the White House said it had barred a transgender activist who went topless at its Pride event.
And while Mr. Biden's age has become one of his chief political weaknesses, both his allies and adversaries say it also helps insulate him from cultural attacks by Republicans.
"Everybody wants to talk about how old Joe Biden is, but the truth of the matter is it's his age and his experience that allow him to be who he is and allow him to say the things and to help people in a way that nobody else can," said Henry R. Muñoz III, a former Democratic National Committee finance director. Mr. Muñoz, who is gay, had Mr. Biden serve as his wedding officiant in 2017.
Much of Mr. Biden's loyalty from L.G.B.T.Q. Democrats stems from his 2012 endorsement of same-sex marriages when Mr. Obama was still officially opposed to them. Mr. Biden's position was seen as politically risky at the time, before the Supreme Court in 2015 recognized the right of same-sex couples to marry, but has evolved into something he bragged about during his 2020 campaign.
He has also been on the forefront of recognizing transgender rights. In his first week in office, Mr. Biden ended the Trump-era ban on transgender troops in the military. In December, he signed into law federal protections for same-sex marriages.
At the same time, Mr. Biden has not adopted the terminology of progressive activists or allowed himself to be drawn into public debates that might leave him outside the political mainstream. On Thursday, after the Supreme Court's major ruling ending affirmative action in college admissions, a reporter asked him, "Is this a rogue court?"
Pausing to think for a moment, Mr. Biden responded, "This is not a normal court."
He also does not always remember the words most American politicians use to describe L.G.B.T.Q. people. At the fund-raiser near San Francisco last month, Mr. Biden lamented the Supreme Court's decision last year that ended the national right to an abortion and suggested the court was coming for gay rights next.
Paraphrasing two of the conservative justices, he said: "There's no constitutional right in the law for H-B, excuse me, for gay, lesbian, you know, the whole, the whole group. There's no constitutional protection."
During a stop at the Iowa State Fair during his 2020 campaign, a conservative provocateur trailing the Democratic presidential candidates asked Mr. Biden, "How many genders are there?"
Mr. Biden replied: "There are at least three. Don't play games with me, kid."
Then, perhaps not realizing that his inquisitor was a right-wing activist, Mr. Biden added: "By the way, first one to come out for marriage was me."
Sarah McBride, a Delaware state senator who recently began a campaign to become the first transgender member of Congress, said Mr. Biden's language gave him the ability to solidify Democrats behind a progressive social agenda and "reach communities and demographics that are not yet fully in the coalition."
"He's not getting caught up on rhetoric that isn't understandable for your middle-of-the-road voter," Ms. McBride said.
She also pointed to Mr. Biden's age as helpful for making Democrats' case on social issues without alienating skeptical voters.
"His background allows him to say things that I think would be heard as more radical if they were said by a younger politician," she said.
As majorities of Americans have accepted gay marriage, social conservatives have made opposition to transgender rights a mainstay of their politics. And Republicans running to displace Mr. Biden have tended to focus on energizing G.O.P. primary voters rather than making a villain out of the president.
"It's hard to paint an 80-year-old white man as a flaming woke warrior," said Whit Ayres, a longtime pollster for Republican candidates.
Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida is perhaps the leading purveyor of Republicans' anti-"woke" message, throwing barbs both online and in speeches. On Friday, his campaign cast even Mr. Trump as too liberal on L.G.B.T.Q. issues in a provocative video posted on Twitter.
At a June rally in Tulsa, Okla., Mr. DeSantis described being approached by military veterans who don't want their children and grandchildren joining the armed forces because of liberal policy changes instituted by Democrats -- though the governor blamed Mr. Obama as much as he did Mr. Biden.
"A woke military is not going to be a strong military," Mr. DeSantis said. "You got to get the politicization out of it. And on Day 1, we're ripping out all the Obama-Biden policies to woke-ify the military."
Mr. Biden has never presented as a left-wing culture warrior. A Catholic, he has long been wary about jumping headlong into fights over abortion rights. Even as his campaign and party are preparing to make his re-election bid a referendum on Republican efforts to further restrict abortion, Mr. Biden proclaimed to a crowd of donors in suburban Washington that he himself was not eager to do so.
"You know, I happen to be a practicing Catholic," Mr. Biden said last week. "I'm not big on abortion. But guess what? Roe v. Wade got it right."
That stance has long caused some consternation among Democrats. It took until June 2019, weeks after beginning his 2020 campaign and under immense pressure from allies in his party, for Mr. Biden to renounce his long-held support for banning federal funding for abortions.
Renee Bracey Sherman, the founder of We Testify, a group that shares women's stories of having abortions, said Mr. Biden would need to adopt a more forceful position in favor of abortion rights to energize liberal voters in 2024. She suggested that in the same way Mr. Biden hosts championship sports teams at the White House, he should invite women who have had abortions to come and tell their stories.
"The midterms show that Americans love abortion," Ms. Bracey Sherman said. "Abortion has a higher approval rating than he does. He should be riding the abortion wave."

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden memorably jumped the gun on Barack Obama in endorsing same-sex marriage more than a decade ago, but at a June fundraiser near San Francisco, he couldn’t recall the letters LGBTQ.

At the fundraiser near San Francisco last month, Biden lamented the Supreme Court’s decision last year that ended the national right to an abortion and suggested the court was coming for gay rights next.
Paraphrasing two of the conservative justices, he said: “There’s no constitutional right in the law for H-B, excuse me, for gay, lesbian, you know, the whole, the whole group. There’s no constitutional protection.”
During a stop at the Iowa State Fair during his 2020 campaign, a conservative provocateur trailing the Democratic presidential candidates asked Biden, “How many genders are there?”
Biden replied: “There are at least three. Don’t play games with me, kid.”
Then, perhaps not realizing that his inquisitor was a right-wing activist, Biden added: “By the way, first one to come out for marriage was me.”
Sarah McBride, a Delaware state senator who recently began a campaign to become the first transgender member of Congress, said Biden’s language gave him the ability to solidify Democrats behind a progressive social agenda and “reach communities and demographics that are not yet fully in the coalition.”
“He’s not getting caught up on rhetoric that isn’t understandable for your middle-of-the-road voter,” McBride said.
She also pointed to Biden’s age as helpful for making Democrats’ case on social issues without alienating skeptical voters.
“His background allows him to say things that I think would be heard as more radical if they were said by a younger politician,” she said.
As majorities of Americans have accepted same-sex marriage, social conservatives have made opposition to transgender rights a mainstay of their politics. And Republicans running to displace Biden have tended to focus on energizing GOP primary voters rather than making a villain out of the president.
“It’s hard to paint an 80-year-old white man as a flaming woke warrior,” said Whit Ayres, a longtime pollster for Republican candidates.
Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida is perhaps the leading purveyor of Republicans’ anti-“woke” message, throwing barbs both online and in speeches. On Friday, his campaign cast even former President Donald Trump as too liberal on LGBTQ issues in a provocative video posted on Twitter.
At a June rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, DeSantis described being approached by military veterans who don’t want their children and grandchildren joining the armed forces because of liberal policy changes instituted by Democrats — though the governor blamed Obama as much as he did Biden.
“A woke military is not going to be a strong military,” DeSantis said. “You got to get the politicization out of it. And on Day 1, we’re ripping out all the Obama-Biden policies to woke-ify the military.”
Biden has never presented as a left-wing culture warrior. A Catholic, he has long been wary about jumping headlong into fights over abortion rights. Even as his campaign and party are preparing to make his reelection bid a referendum on Republican efforts to further restrict abortion, Biden proclaimed to a crowd of donors in suburban Washington that he himself was not eager to do so.
“You know, I happen to be a practicing Catholic,” Biden said last week. “I’m not big on abortion. But guess what? Roe v. Wade got it right.”
That stance has long caused some consternation among Democrats. It took until June 2019, weeks after beginning his 2020 campaign and under immense pressure from allies in his party, for Biden to renounce his long-held support for banning federal funding for abortions.
Renee Bracey Sherman, the founder of We Testify, a group that shares women’s stories of having abortions, said Biden would need to adopt a more forceful position in favor of abortion rights to energize liberal voters in 2024. She suggested that in the same way Biden hosts championship sports teams at the White House, he should invite women who have had abortions to come and tell their stories.
“The midterms show that Americans love abortion,” Bracey Sherman said. “Abortion has a higher approval rating than he does. He should be riding the abortion wave.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The graphic novelist ND Stevenson wrote the trans allegory long before he came out. When it was time to adapt it for a new film, he was ready to go further.
In the new Netflix animated film "Nimona," the titular character makes its first appearance as a redheaded teenage girl before transforming into a charging rhino, then a grizzly, then a songbird and so on, with brief stopovers as a gorilla, an ostrich and an armadillo.
After Ballister Boldheart (voiced by Riz Ahmed) a prim, by-the-book knight, asks her, "Can you please just be normal for a second?" he wonders if all that shape-shifting hurts. "Honestly? I feel worse when I don't do it," Nimona (Chloë Grace Moretz) replies.
ND Stevenson, who wrote and drew the graphic novel on which the film is based, said he had always loved shape-shifters. But his animated film explores elements of the trans experience -- the clumsy questions from well-meaning friends, the outright hatred from strangers -- only hinted at in his award-winning book, a beloved staple of the L.G.B.T.Q. literary canon.
"The themes have their roots in the comic," Stevenson explained. "But it would be years before I came out as gay, years before I came out as trans. Narratives have been my way of exploring those identities, even as allegory."
The film brings those themes to the fore at a time when trans rights have come increasingly under attack. "We knew what we were doing," Stevenson said of the filmmakers. "We knew what we wanted to say."
"But even back then," he continued, "I don't think any of us knew how bleak things were going to get, the backlash against trans and queer people, and how much the movie was going to speak to that."
"Nimona" focuses on the budding friendship between Nimona and Ballister, who is wrongly accused of murdering his queen. The film also features a sweet, star-crossed romance between Ballister, who is already mistrusted because he's a commoner among nobles, and Ambrosius Goldenloin, a dreamy, lovesick knight (Eugene Lee Yang).
"This is a story that is, at its heart, a love letter to anybody who's ever felt different or misunderstood," said Troy Quane, who directed the movie along with Nick Bruno.
The film had its beginnings in 2015, the same year the book was published, and is that rarest of Hollywood literary makeovers. For decades, gay characters and relationships in literary classics were straightwashed on the big screen, whether in "The Maltese Falcon" and "Breakfast at Tiffany's" or "Fried Green Tomatoes" and "The Color Purple."
In "Nimona," the story became more queer friendly on its way to Hollywood, not less.
For Stevenson, much of the book spoke to his own upbringing and experiences. "Coming from a really conservative family and the evangelical church in the South," he said, "the story is definitely a reaction to that."
On a recent afternoon, Stevenson was at the Netflix Animation studio in Burbank discussing how his film came to be. Dressed in a green "Big Sur Monterey County" sweatshirt and flannel trousers, his red hair cut short, Stevenson talked about his background, his beginnings as an artist and how the story morphed -- much like the shape-shifting Nimona -- on its way from book to screen.
Stevenson, 31, was born and raised in Columbia, S.C., the middle child of five siblings. After years of home-schooling and two more at the local high school, he went to the Maryland Institute College of Art, where he began posting Nimona comics online in 2012, a project that became his senior thesis. "When I first started making the comic, I didn't consider myself a writer," he said. "I was in school for illustration. But comics was kind of my way of tricking myself into thinking like, no, I am a writer."
Online, the series quickly gained fans, and in graphic novel form, "Nimona" won several awards including an Eisner, the comics industry's most prestigious honor, and was a National Book Award finalist. Stevenson was 24. That year, Fox Animation acquired the rights to make an animated feature based on the comic, and called on Blue Sky Studios (the "Ice Age" franchise) to make it.
The next five years were busy and creative ones. In addition to adapting "Nimona," Stevenson collaborated with several others in creating and writing "Lumberjanes," an Eisner-winning comic book series set in a summer camp for "hardcore lady types." He also became the show runner of the DreamWorks series "She-Ra and the Princesses of Power," a fantastical, queer-friendly reboot of the 1980s cartoon, which went on to win an Emmy and a GLAAD Media Award.
In 2020, Stevenson published the memoir "The Fire Never Goes Out," a collection of "year in review" comics that run from his college days and subsequent creative triumphs to his marriage, in 2019, to fellow cartoonist and writer Molly Ostertag. In the book, he writes about coming out, the joys of life with Molly, and his struggles with body image and mental health; in several, he draws himself with an enormous hole in the center of his torso or consumed by flames.
"I can't literally grab my emotions and shape them into something that makes sense," he said. "But I can wrestle with a drawing and try to make it make sense."
Meanwhile, at Blue Sky, the filmmakers worked to find the heart of "Nimona," a way into a character who was, by definition, ever-changing and hard to define.
"It was a difficult thing to capture," Moretz said. "It was so fun, but I would come home and I would look at my partner and be like, I can't talk. I can't do anything but rest."
Early versions, Stevenson said, ended up with Ballister as the focus and Nimona as some sort of manic pixie dream girl, playing second fiddle to the lovelorn knight.
Nobody wanted that. Somehow, they had to find the human core of a character who was, in many ways, anything but. "Everybody was very clear that 'Nimona' was this universal story, a love story," Bruno said. "But there was a particular group of people who were really passionate about it, and those were the people at Blue Sky who were members of the L.G.B.T.Q+ community."
In group discussions, they were sharing their stories and what the book meant to them. "We thought, why not, if this group feels OK with it, incorporate some of these stories in the film?" Bruno said.
In the book, the Ballister-Goldenloin romance is only hinted at. In the film, however, there's a kiss, an "I love you" between the knights, and even a back story to explain why they're so nuts about each other in the first place. As for Nimona, the character is not trans, per se (or even, as the filmmakers note, female, although Nimona can be, should the mood strike). But the parallels are there, for those who care to look.
In 2021, Disney, which had acquired Blue Sky in its acquisition of Fox, shuttered the studio and "Nimona" with it, only two days before a planned screening for the cast and crew. "Just like that, 450 people were out of a job," Stevenson recalled. "It was heartbreaking."
The team decided to go ahead with the screening, a premiere of sorts as well as a goodbye. "No one wanted to click out of the Zoom meeting," Quane recalled.
The following year, after the creators spent months shopping the project, Annapurna Pictures opted to revive the film. "We all got together and just wanted to cry, because we were like, Nimona survived," Moretz said. "It was such a testament to who she is, and her resilience."
If you want to watch the film as a trans allegory, there's certainly a lot there. But if you just want to watch a beautifully animated adventure story filled with castles and knights and laser cannons and flying cars, starring a shape-shifting force of nature who likes to blow stuff up, there's that, too. Stevenson thinks there's room for both readings.
"My opinions of that continue to evolve," said Stevenson, who is working on developing "Lumberjanes" and a project based on a novel he wrote at 15. "On the one hand, I think that explicit representation is really, really important. But I also know there's certain media that I never would have gotten to read as a kid if it had been marketed that way."
"I think if I were making the comic now, there's a lot more I would have done with it, and it's cool to see the movie do that," he continued. "But I also think there's a certain power in having a story that clearly expresses that, but maybe flies under the radar of parents who might be less willing to put that book in their kids' hands."

A Media-Rights Muddle Stifles San Diego State: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: San Diego State had to make a decision about whether to leave the Mountain West Conference. It stayed put, but a move to the Pac-12 still beckons.
The latest turn of the conference realignment carousel driven by college football took me back to the Pleistocene period of journalism, when I worked as a summer news desk clerk amid the telex machines, pneumatic tubes and desk drawers full of booze at the dearly departed Los Angeles Herald Examiner.
A sign on an editor's desk caught my eye: "Deadline is a two-syllable word." Succinct and sly, it mocked one of the newsroom's most sacrosanct tenets: Don't blow deadline.
But in the digital era of continuous publishing, the notion of a deadline -- which melds two of Merriam-Webster's more unequivocal words -- has somehow become malleable, a transformation that brings me back to the recent maneuverings of San Diego State University.
If the school was going to leave the Mountain West Conference for the Pac-12 in a year, it faced an 11 p.m. Pacific Time deadline on Friday to notify the Mountain West. Otherwise, its exit fee would double to about $ 36 million.
The problem: San Diego State did not have an offer from the Pac-12 Conference.
The reason: The Pac-12 did not have a media rights deal. (More on that in a moment.)
As the hourglass emptied on Friday, the Pac-12 chancellors and presidents convened to receive another one of their regular updates on the media rights negotiations. Later, San Diego State informed the Mountain West that it would stay put. For now.
That this unfolded on June 30 was fitting.
Last year on that date, Southern California and U.C.L.A., the Pac-12's football and basketball standard-bearers, stunned the college athletics world by deciding to bolt for the Big Ten when the Pac-12's television contract expires after the 2023-24 season.
This opened the door of opportunity for San Diego State, which has long pined for a move to the Pac-12 -- a switch that would not only confer athletics legitimacy, but also put a California State University school on equal footing with Cal-Berkeley, a flagship school in the more prestigious University of California system.
It would require a three-step process. First, the Pac-12 would secure a media rights deal. Next, the 10 remaining members (the Pac-12 hoped) would sign a grant of rights, binding them to the conference for the duration of the media rights agreement. And finally, the conference would consider expansion.
Yet a year later, the Pac-12 is still in first gear.
The Pac-12, whose current agreement with ESPN and Fox expires after this season, found itself boxed out of several options when the Big 12 surprisingly locked in its media deal with Fox and ESPN last October, two months after the Big Ten announced its deal with Fox, CBS and NBC. The Southeastern Conference's 10-year contract with ESPN kicks in next year, and the Atlantic Coast Conference's deal with ESPN runs until 2036.
That leaves few openings on the broadcast schedule to showcase the Pac-12.
"The problem for the Pac-12 is all the other cards have now been dealt," said Ed Desser, a sports media rights consultant, who noted that the only coveted spot would be Saturday night on ESPN or Friday night on ESPN, Fox, Apple or Amazon.
Negotiations have sputtered for several reasons.
First, the Pac-12 commissioner, George Kliavkoff, tried to persuade the University of California Board of Regents last fall to keep U.C.L.A. from leaving, which would have given the conference the valuable Los Angeles media market to shop around. (In December, the governing board voted not to block the move.)
Also last fall, many media companies began slashing jobs nearly across the board, particularly at Disney, which owns ESPN and said it would shed 7,000 jobs as it dealt with the continuing impact of cord cutting. And while streaming platforms like Apple and Amazon might be attractive, those companies are unlikely to view sports programming (that is not the N.F.L.) as indispensable.
It quickly became apparent that the media industry's belt-tightening would manifest itself in second-tier rights deals. Shortly after the Big 12's deal, which was largely considered below-market at $ 31.7 million per school, the Pac-12 adjusted downward by 10 percent estimates of an agreement it could reach if U.C.L.A. remained.
Then came the delays.
Expectations of an agreement by the start of the Pac-12 men's basketball tournament led to hopes of a deal by the Final Four. And then by mid-April. And then surely by the start of summer. Now, the assumption is that an announcement will be made before the Pac-12's football media day on July 21, so that the event's dominant story line is actually football.
Of course, what is in the agreement will have consequences.
The Big 12, which added Brigham Young, Cincinnati, Central Florida and Houston on Saturday, and could lose Texas and Oklahoma this time next year, is interested in poaching any Pac-12 school that is unhappy enough to jump if the payout is significantly below what the Big 12 is receiving.
In that case, it would not take much -- Colorado and Arizona leaving, perhaps, or Utah -- for the Pac-12 to disintegrate.
These are the scenarios that San Diego State had to game out. The Aztecs, who came within one final push of winning a men's basketball championship and who regularly exhibit a quietly competent football team, are in a familiar spot. They agreed in 2011 to jump to the Big East for football, while playing in the Big West for other sports. But two years later, that agreement collapsed and they remained in the Mountain West.
Last month, the San Diego State president, Adela de la Torre, wrote a letter to the Mountain West saying the school intended to leave and asking for more time. A flurry of back-and-forth letters ensued.
In the end, San Diego State determined that its conference exit may well be negotiable, as many before it have been. And so the school concluded that if a move to the Pac-12 were to happen, it would happen in time -- deadlines be damned.

How ‘Nimona’ Helped Its Creator Explore His Emerging Identity

BURBANK, Calif. — In the new Netflix animated film “Nimona,” the titular character makes its first appearance as a redheaded teenage girl before transforming into a charging rhino, then a grizzly, then a songbird and so on, with brief stopovers as a gorilla, an ostrich and an armadillo.
After Ballister Boldheart (voiced by Riz Ahmed) a prim, by-the-book knight, asks her, “Can you please just be normal for a second?” he wonders if all that shape-shifting hurts. “Honestly? I feel worse when I don’t do it,” Nimona (Chloë Grace Moretz) replies.
ND Stevenson, who wrote and drew the graphic novel on which the film is based, said he had always loved shape-shifters. But his animated film explores elements of the trans experience — the clumsy questions from well-meaning friends, the outright hatred from strangers — only hinted at in his award-winning book, a beloved staple of the LGBTQ literary canon.
“The themes have their roots in the comic,” Stevenson explained. “But it would be years before I came out as gay, years before I came out as trans. Narratives have been my way of exploring those identities, even as allegory.”
The film brings those themes to the fore at a time when trans rights have come increasingly under attack. “We knew what we were doing,” Stevenson said of the filmmakers. “We knew what we wanted to say.”
“But even back then,” he continued, “I don’t think any of us knew how bleak things were going to get, the backlash against trans and queer people, and how much the movie was going to speak to that.”
“Nimona” focuses on the budding friendship between Nimona and Ballister, who is wrongly accused of murdering his queen. The film also features a sweet, star-crossed romance between Ballister, who is already mistrusted because he’s a commoner among nobles, and Ambrosius Goldenloin, a dreamy, lovesick knight (Eugene Lee Yang).
“This is a story that is, at its heart, a love letter to anybody who’s ever felt different or misunderstood,” said Troy Quane, who directed the movie along with Nick Bruno.

In 2021, Disney, which had acquired Blue Sky in its acquisition of Fox, shuttered the studio and “Nimona” with it, only two days before a planned screening for the cast and crew. “Just like that, 450 people were out of a job,” Stevenson recalled. “It was heartbreaking.”
The team decided to go ahead with the screening, a premiere of sorts as well as a goodbye. “No one wanted to click out of the Zoom meeting,” Quane recalled.
The following year, after the creators spent months shopping the project, Annapurna Pictures opted to revive the film. “We all got together and just wanted to cry, because we were like, Nimona survived,” Moretz said. “It was such a testament to who she is, and her resilience.”
If you want to watch the film as a trans allegory, there’s certainly a lot there. But if you just want to watch a beautifully animated adventure story filled with castles and knights and laser cannons and flying cars, starring a shape-shifting force of nature who likes to blow stuff up, there’s that, too. Stevenson thinks there’s room for both readings.
“My opinions of that continue to evolve,” said Stevenson, who is working on developing “Lumberjanes” and a project based on a novel he wrote at 15. “On the one hand, I think that explicit representation is really, really important. But I also know there’s certain media that I never would have gotten to read as a kid if it had been marketed that way.”
“I think if I were making the comic now, there’s a lot more I would have done with it, and it’s cool to see the movie do that,” he continued. “But I also think there’s a certain power in having a story that clearly expresses that, but maybe flies under the radar of parents who might be less willing to put that book in their kids’ hands.”

'Flamin' Hot' Is So Bad, It Burns: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "Flamin' Hot," a movie released this month and recently screened on the South Lawn of the White House, is a piece of propaganda designed to make Mexican Americans, and Latinos more broadly, feel good about ourselves. There's nothing inherently wrong with creating a film that seeks to make a person or a group feel good. (See: the genre of feel-good movies.) It can even be affirming to see yourself reflected in various media.
But "Flamin' Hot" is not only a very bad movie. It is a poor piece of propaganda. Wittingly or otherwise, it bolsters the white supremacy it purports to combat. By depicting a world in which Mexican Americans (and by implication all Latinos) need the approval of white people to feel good about ourselves, it reinforces the myth of white superiority. Winning, in the world of "Flamin' Hot," means becoming like those who oppress you.
Given the gross underrepresentation of Latinos and our stories on bookshelves, small screens and silver screens, criticizing the movie, Eva Longoria's feature directing debut, may provoke fellow Latinos to paint me as an anti-Latina, as a race traitor, as a pocho, slang for a Mexican American who's lost his connection to his ancestry.
I should be happy that the movie was picked up at all, they may say, and by Searchlight Pictures, Disney+ and Hulu, no less.
But I'm not content with crumbs. Nobody should be. Latinos deserve complexity and nuance, truth and beauty. Latinos deserve art, not insultingly simplistic, barely disguised agendas that undermine our inherent and inalienable dignity.
"Flamin' Hot" is a film based on the life of Richard Montañez, a man who claims to have invented the Flamin' Hot Cheeto. He almost certainly didn't, a fact we know thanks to The Los Angeles Times. Even so, Richard, played by Jesse Garcia, is portrayed as a janitor turned Flamin' Hot Cheeto inventor and marketing whiz. Through hard work and initiative, he saves his factory and his co-workers' jobs, earning a place among C-suite executives in the process.
"Initiative" is an important word in "Flamin' Hot." Early in the movie, when Richard is scrounging for a job, any job, a white shop owner tells him that he just doesn't "look like the kind of guy who's got an ounce of initiative." His arc over the next hour and a half reaches a thematic climax during a phone call with Roger Enrico, who was then the chief executive of PepsiCo and, by extension, Frito-Lay. "I can't stop thinking about your initiative," Roger says.
Richard has won over a white man.
"Initiative" brings to mind another purportedly uplifting film, "Stand and Deliver," a 1988 drama starring Edward James Olmos as Jaime Escalante, a Latino math teacher who transforms a class of underperformers into overachievers. In that movie, the operative word is "ganas," a term that denotes desire, ambition, initiative. "You already have two strikes against you: your name and your complexion," Jaime says in one of the movie's most famous scenes. "You're going to work harder here than you've ever worked anywhere else," he tells the class. "And the only thing I ask from you is ganas." Thirty-five years later, "Flamin' Hot" conveys the same message: With hard work and initiative, you can dispel the stereotype of the dumb, lazy Mexican.
Stereotypes are a fact of life in a racist society. Understanding that they are reductive generalizations, rather than enduring truths, does little to drain racially coded behavior of its stakes. In college, for example, if white professors or peers were late to a class or meeting, I'd assume they had a good reason. If I was late to a class or meeting, I couldn't help but wonder if some thought I was on C.P. time, so-called colored people time, a concept I learned about only through the comedic stylings of Bill de Blasio and Hillary Clinton.
But haven't we realized by this, the 2023rd year of our Lord, that the onus is on those who hold the stereotype rather than on us? "Flamin' Hot" says no, that only through the gospel of ganas may we enter the kingdom of heaven. The film fails to realize that America is a Calvinist country -- our works won't save us. At this point, Latinos won't persuade anyone to accept us who hasn't already. We're wasting our time trying.
But, oh, how "Flamin' Hot" tries. In one scene, a few white kids tease a young Richard about his lunch, a burrito. "Looks like it came out of a toilet," one says. Richard loudly extols the virtues of his lunch: "Oh, my God," he says in a heavy accent, his eyes going wide. "So good! Delicioso! Want some?" One kid dares his friend to try it. A cascade of praise follows after he takes a bite. "Hey, this is pretty good!" he says. "I want some! Give me one!" says another. And thus Chipotle is born.
Later, when trying to convince a pessimistic co-worker that the Flamin' Hot Cheeto is the key to saving the factory, Richard looks back at that moment: "Sometimes, we just got to show them what the burrito's worth." He continues: "It may look like it's worthless, but if people just took a bite, they'd see." If it's not clear -- these lines are delivered with the subtlety of a brick thrown through a window -- he is talking about more than just burritos. There are more explicit and egregious examples of our people being analogized to food throughout the movie. In another scene, he refers to workers in the endangered factory as "a bunch of brown chips on a conveyor belt, waiting to get tossed."
"Flamin' Hot" offers a road map to winning over the white man: Try our burritos, get to know us and see that we're not all bad! And the movie is bookended by scenes in which Richard wins a seat at the literal and metaphorical white man's table. The film opens on a shot of Latino chefs cooking, then follows a Latino waiter around a restaurant that, save for Richard and his wife, looks to be patronized entirely by white people. As Richard exits the restaurant, he doles out generous-seeming tips to the wait staff, the busboy and the valet, all Latino.
"Flamin' Hot" isn't even effective propaganda. There can be a successful Latino, the movie says, but only one; the people who serve him must also be Latino. Almost all the white people in the film are cast as villains, but in the end, they are bafflingly worth joining rather than defeating. You can be a Latino and take a white man's place, but once there, you have to maintain the existing racial order.
I don't tend to watch movies that speak so directly to this aspect of my identity. It's not because they don't affect me but because I fear they will affect me too much. Feelings can be overwhelming, feelings about race unbearably so. But when I saw that much of the criticism around the movie dealt with its lack of veracity, I wanted to see it for myself and take it on its own terms.
A movie can depart from the strict truth and capture a broader, deeper truth, so I hoped "Flamin' Hot" would surprise me. Watching it was an utter disappointment, and I can only hope that the people who are enthusiastic about it soon train a more critical eye on it and on what it stands for. Once we realize that it's asking us to grovel for white acceptance, to join the ranks of the oppressors without meaningfully improving the lots of all of us, we should never stream this movie again.
I hope Ms. Longoria makes another movie. I hope that more stories about Latinos, by Latinos, make it into our various media. But I also hope those stories cover new ground in the quest to map the reality of being Latino, of being human. "Flamin' Hot," rather than expanding or even aptly describing that reality, constricts it.

This Broadcast TV Genre Continues to Thrive: G_ME SH_WS: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: One by one, as streaming services grow in popularity, old standbys of the TV landscape are falling by the wayside.
The number of soap operas, a decades-old linchpin of daytime television, has fallen to a small handful. Hit daytime talk shows -- once hosted by the likes of Phil Donahue, Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres -- are becoming rarer by the year. Late-night shows are dwindling.
But one golden oldie is still standing strong: game shows.
ABC's lineup this fall is populated by many of them. On CBS, one of the longest-running shows, "The Price Is Right," is getting a new studio. And ratings for "Jeopardy!" and "Wheel of Fortune," tops in the category, are among the most-watched programs in television -- at least outside of live sports. Both attract around nine million viewers on a typical night, and generate tens of millions of dollars in profit each year.
This week, Sony, the studio behind both "Jeopardy!" and "Wheel of Fortune," gave the genre an emphatic vote of confidence. The company signed Ryan Seacrest, one of television's most recognizable personalities, to a long-term deal to replace Pat Sajak as the next host of "Wheel of Fortune."
The audience for Sony's two shows is, in the words of one executive at a rival studio, "shockingly big." Adam Nedeff, a researcher at the National Archives of Game Show History at the Strong National Museum of Play, said "Wheel of Fortune" "has survived even beyond the wildest expectations of success."
"'Wheel of Fortune' remains this giant," said Mr. Nedeff, who is the author of "Game Shows FAQ," a history of the format. "As the TV business changes, and streaming takes over the world, 'Wheel' is one of the things that endures on the old traditional model of TV."
Game shows offer two big benefits for executives: They are one of the least expensive programs to create, in part because many episodes can be filmed in a short period. And they are attractive to the largest demographic group that still consumes traditional television -- people 60 and older.
The median "Wheel of Fortune" viewer is in the oldest age bracket that Nielsen tracks: "65+." (The median ages of many of the higher-rated entertainment shows in prime time in the most recent television season -- "Survivor" (62.1), "Abbott Elementary" (60.2), "The Voice" (64.8) -- are not far behind.)
Among adults under 50, the demographic that most interests advertisers, the two game shows draw similar ratings: "Jeopardy!" averages 1.1 million viewers in that bracket and "Wheel of Fortune" one million.
Game shows have been around since the earliest days of television. From the quiz shows of the 1950s to the dating shows of the 1960s and 1970s, game shows have been as much a tradition for American television as football on Sunday afternoons.
The biggest success stories these days are thoroughbreds that have endured decades. "Family Feud," which began in 1976 and is currently hosted by Steve Harvey, draws nearly eight million viewers per episode, one of the highest viewership totals in all of syndicated television, according to Nielsen. CBS announced that "The Price Is Right," hosted by Drew Carey since 2007, will move into a "state-of-the-art facility" in Glendale, Calif., for the show's 52nd season this year.
Beginning in September, ABC's lineup will feature an hourlong edition of "Celebrity Jeopardy!" on Tuesday nights and a full Thursday prime-time lineup of "Celebrity Wheel of Fortune," "Press Your Luck" and "The $ 100,000 Pyramid."
Many of the current network prime-time game shows are not exactly ratings blockbusters. But their relatively small budgets make them easy for network executives to swallow, especially compared with the ballooning production costs of scripted television.
Sony's new deal with Mr. Seacrest suggests that the company plans for "Wheel of Fortune" to continue long into the future. The deal is expected to last through the early 2030s, a person who is familiar with it said.
Selecting Mr. Seacrest, however, is not without risk. When Merv Griffin created "Wheel of Fortune" in 1975 as television's answer to hangman, it spent its early years on ratings life support. It wasn't until Mr. Sajak and Vanna White, his co-host, joined in the early 1980s that the show took off. By the mid-1980s, it was drawing more than 40 million viewers a night.
Whether viewers tune out because Mr. Sajak isn't on the stage is an open question. He and Ms. White both have above-average favorable views among viewers, according to Q Score, the research firm that measures the likability of celebrities. Mr. Seacrest, however, is below average, according to Q Score, suggesting he may be polarizing to a segment of the audience.
Additionally, Ms. White's future with the show is uncertain. She is under contract for another year and is in negotiations for a new deal. Puck reported last week that Ms. White made significantly less money than Mr. Sajak and had not gotten a raise in nearly two decades. Many "Wheel of Fortune" fans on social media had expressed hope that she could replace Mr. Sajak -- if she departs, will droves of viewers leave with her?
Mr. Seacrest, though, has repeatedly demonstrated an ability to bring a steady hand to longtime franchises. He successfully took over Dick Clark's long-running New Year's Eve show. He assumed a seat that once belonged to Regis Philbin -- as well as Michael Strahan -- on "Live," the show he co-hosted for six years with Kelly Ripa. And in 2004 he took over the radio show once hosted by Casey Kasem.
Mr. Seacrest's rapid appointment -- Mr. Sajak said only two weeks ago that he would leave "Wheel of Fortune" in 2024 -- also is a way for Sony executives to avoid the succession crisis that enveloped "Jeopardy!" two years ago. In 2021, Sony executives quickly pushed out Alex Trebek's successor, Mike Richards, amid a public uproar after sexist and offensive comments Mr. Richards had made surfaced online. Sony eventually named Ken Jennings and Mayim Bialik as Mr. Trebek's permanent successors.
Mr. Nedeff, the game show historian, said that as long as Mr. Seacrest recognized who the true star was, he should be successful.
"The big driver for the show is the game," he said. "The game is the star of the show."

Getting Medieval On Oppressors, All Jokes Aside: [Review]

Full text: A zingy, chintzy, idea-driven animated feature based on the ND Stevenson comic.
Imagine Bugs Bunny blended with the Joker and you'll get a sense of Nimona, an impish, shape-shifting villain who presents as a pink-haired, miniskirted punk but prefers to buck description. "I'm not a girl, I'm a shark!" Nimona (voiced by a vibrant Chloë Grace Moretz) insists. At will, Nimona is also an otter, ostrich, rhinoceros, gorilla, girl-shaped humanoid, boy-shaped humanoid, kitty cat, pizza rat and blue whale who swallows its enemies and squirts them out of its blowhole with a filthy snicker.
Likewise, "Nimona," a zingy, chintzy, idea-driven animated feature, was once a Tumblr comic, an art school thesis and an award-winning graphic novel (all three incarnations by the author ND Stevenson). Then, in 2021, it became an internet cri de coeur when Disney shut down production on a feature. Annapurna and Netflix stepped in, and the final film version, directed by Nick Bruno and Troy Quane from a script by Robert L. Baird and Lloyd Taylor, is a rush job with little resemblance to the much bleaker web comic. But it's a vivid creature all its own.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The story is set in a futuro-medieval walled city with jumbotrons and knights who say, "Bro." Fear has reigned for a millennium, ever since the hero Gloreth battled back a monster. Now, Gloreth's Valkyrie-esque statue looms large over the populace, casting a shadow that extends over billboards that blare, "If you see something, slay something," and an outlaw knight, Ballister Boldheart (Riz Ahmed), cowering in disgrace from a wrongful accusation of regicide.
Ballister yearns to be once again embraced by the kingdom, and his ex, the lustily named Ambrosius Goldenloin (Eugene Lee Yang), who broke Ballister's heart and sliced off his arm. Enter Nimona, a bloodthirsty wrecking ball who wants to use Ballister to destroy the entire system. To do so, Nimona brings further shame upon the exile, even publicly claiming that Ballister likes -- Egads! -- freestyle jazz.
At first, the look (particularly the lifeless backgrounds) is so slapdash that you're tempted to flee. But jokes litter the film like scattered Legos, making you hesitate long enough to appreciate how the light glints off Ballister's armor-plated shoulders. Attention has been paid; it's just not equally distributed. The tone is uneasy teetering on anarchic, veering from giddily moronic one-liners to -- more shockingly -- a climax with deep empathy and visual awe.
This is a big message film that wants audiences to reflect on social paranoia. At its heart, it's a pointed allegory about politicians who build their national profile on the backs of queer and transgender children. Nimona the character doesn't claim to speak for them, but does try to speak to them and to others grappling with the concept of what it might feel like when your shell doesn't match your soul. "I feel worse when I don't do it," Nimona says of metamorphosing, "like my insides are itchy." But the movie is also willing to poke fun at its own politics when, minutes later, Nimona sabotages a losing game of Monopoly with a comic rant about overthrowing our oppressors, and, as a capper, feigns sudden death.

Full text: Julian Kent
Through July 14. Kerry Schuss Gallery, 73 Leonard Street, Manhattan, 212-219-9918, kerryschussgallery.com.
With his "Everyday Life" paintings the 21-year-old artist Julian Kent is already past the "looks promising" stage of his career. As seen in New York at the Independent Art Fair and especially in his current gallery debut, his paintings exude a youthful perfection. They operate as both narratives and objects with utmost efficiency; nothing is wasted or left over.
Kent's small, stylized canvases depict specific moments in the lives of one or two Black people, seen in close-up, often tightly cropped. The setting is usually domestic; the action is primarily psychological and emotional, conveyed in subtle glances and gestures. Kent outlines his shapes in black and uses a palette of inspired plainness; his robust textures are particularly engaging. His small repeating brush strokes can evoke Robert Ryman, Philip Guston and Robert Thompson, only neater; their changes in direction or rhythm, create a sense of sturdiness and care that is implicitly optimistic.
The paintings at the Independent were fraught with apprehension -- the racial stress that are far too constant to Black American life. The paintings at Schuss replace tension with moments of quiet enjoyment and togetherness cherished by all people. In "Late Afternoon," a young woman and man sit in their living room; he touches her arm. In the background, a television shows a hand reminiscent of the hand of God bringing Adam to life in Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling. Did this cue the man's light touch, or does it underscore the transformative power of touch, and love?
"Grey Gardens," takes its title from the Maysles brothers' 1975 documentary about the eccentric mother-daughter pair of high-society dropouts, Big Edie (Edith Bouvier Beale) and Little Edie, who lived in a squalid mansion in East Hampton with several dozen cats. But he substitutes a visibly less eccentric couple: a Black father and son with their cat. Their eyes convey different emotions: happiness, worry and watchfulness. WASP propriety is embraced and mocked by one of the painting's largest shapes: the son's tattersall shirt. ROBERTA SMITH
Nachume Miller
Through July 10. David Benrimon Fine Art, 41 East 57th Street, second floor, Manhattan; 212-628-6100, davidbenrimon.com.
The churning color of Nachume Miller's last paintings suggest phosphene, the impression of seeing light without any of it being there -- a phenomenon familiar to anyone who has pressed on their eyeball with eyes closed. They also resemble something molecular: pulsating neurons or synapses firing under stress, a revolt of the body.
The retinal effects of "Suns & Illusions," completed from 1996 to 1998, while Miller was undergoing treatment for and until he succumbed to brain cancer, are a Transcendentalist's embrace of the unknown, a transmutation of the natural world into the spiritual one. They are orgiastically physical. Blooms of fungal forms metastasize in fractal, hallucinatory patterns -- somewhere between algae and apparition -- bisected by shafts of light that appear as if clawed into the paint by bare hands. (The more probable technique is hinted at in a short film showing Miller attempting what looks like automatic drawing, including gripping multiple pencils at once.)
The darkness of Miller's earlier preoccupations -- etchings of cadaverous bodies and haunted visions that evince inherited trauma (his parents were the only members of their families to escape the Holocaust) -- lifts here, lighter in palette though no less intense. The smeary, diffuse color fields, reminiscent of Gerhard Richter's squeegeed abstracts, eventually crowd with the gesture Miller used nearly his entire career, a fluid, whorling mark, akin to da Vinci's apocalyptic "deluge" drawings, that threatens to consume itself. They become more densely packed as Miller nears death, a radiant horror vacui -- an artist filling in the empty space for as long as possible. MAX LAKIN
Jaime Muñoz
Through July 8. François Ghebaly, 391 Grand Street, Manhattan; 646-559-9400, ghebaly.com.
Staring you down from the back wall is the passionless alloy skull of a Terminator, specifically the T-800 model portrayed (with skin) by Arnold Schwarzenegger. The California-based artist Jaime Muñoz combines motifs from Central American textiles, Catholic shrines and auto body shops in beatific, biting homages to the SoCal working class. "Machina" turns to the dark side of mechanized labor. The three large paintings on view depict more or less benign metallic products -- Hollywood's killer cyborg, a mechanical knight and a can of Boing! soda -- in minty, glittering pastels, embellished with printer's marks and Love's truck stop logos, in looping designs that seem indebted to Lari Pittman.
The canvases look hands-free, technical and clean. Muñoz renders a richer line among machines, imitation and replacement in a pair of ink on paper drawings. In Mexico, Pato Pascual, a cartoon duck bearing an infringing similarity to Disney's star fowl, Donald, advertises Boing! soda; "Diagram Drawing #8" has Pascual and a spidery prosthetic hand accompanying a picture of a worker on the bottling line.
In a similar composition, Muñoz inks the emblems for Love's and Utility trailers above a diagram of an industrial robot arm and a portrait of A08, the eerie robot "dog" by Boston Dynamics, a war machine with a sinister resemblance to man's best friend. Both drawings portray the alienating beauty of industry, which -- if not quite the rise of the machines -- speaks to the uncertain value of human life in an increasingly automated world.

Sylvia Palacios Whitman
Through July 22. Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, Manhattan; 212-249-8950, as-coa.org.
Simple, literal and often quite funny, many of the drawings and performances in Sylvia Palacios Whitman's exhibition "To Draw a Line With the Body" at Americas Society have been under the radar for decades. At a recent performance and discussion at Americas Society, Palacios admitted that she'd stopped making art for nearly 40 years. She is back now, though, in full force.
Palacios moved to New York from her native Chile in the early 1960s and danced with Trisha Brown. Her early performances -- the first ones were staged in Brown's downtown studio -- included absurd, deadpan movements, like picking up a group of performers with a crane in "Green Bag" (1975), moving them across the space and lowering them into a huge green bag made of fabric. In others, she inserted herself into a giant "Slingshot" (1975) or donned big green sculptural hands. Upon her return to making art, Palacios has been drawing, often illustrating episodes from her childhood, and doing performances explaining the drawings, which are almost like comedy routines.
One thread running through her work is the everyday nature of art. Common materials like kraft paper and cardboard are shaped into sculptures and exhibited on the floor. Anyone, in her estimation, can make art. At the Americas Society event, Palacios even encouraged an audience member who said they weren't an artist to go home and make some art. "You never know!" Palacios exhorted. MARTHA SCHWENDENER

Jubilation, and Resolve, At New York Pride March: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Support for L.G.B.T.Q. people has risen, but so have attacks against them, even in a city known for the strength of its community.
An unbroken parade of marchers -- some dancing and jubilant, some set with determined purpose -- filled Fifth Avenue and the streets of Greenwich Village in Manhattan on Sunday for the New York City Pride March, even as a foreboding backdrop from threats both local and national hung over the day's slate of events.
The march, with its flags and bright floats, marks the 1969 Stonewall riot that spurred the modern L.G.B.T.Q. rights movement. It is the largest of its kind in the United States, with 75,000 marchers and roughly two million spectators, according to organizers.
The event is even now broadcast on network television, a reflection of the fact that public support for L.G.B.T.Q. people has never been higher, coming in between 60 and 70 percent in recent polls.
But backlash to those gains has grown since same-sex marriage became legal nationwide in 2015. In recent years, each successive Pride Month has seemed to go on in defiance of new and ever greater challenges to the L.G.B.T.Q. community.
Over the last year, states across the country have passed laws banning drag performances and transgender health care, while protests and physical attacks on L.G.B.T.Q. events and their supporters have cast a pall over gay bars and community centers.
Juli Culling marched with a sign that read, "I march for my daughter" -- a fact in more ways than one, having crossed the country with her 18-year-old trans daughter from Southern California in search of a more welcoming home.
"I told her to pick a city," Ms. Culling recalled of the move two years ago, "and she said New York."
The experience has been deeply rewarding, and her daughter felt comfortable at her new school, Broome Street Academy, but a threat feels attached to any traveling they do.
"We know how the world is right now. It's scary," she said. Indeed, her daughter was too anxious to march on Sunday, she said.
The Rev. Nicole Garcia, the faith work director at the National LGBTQ task force, acknowledged that today's hostile atmosphere weighs on her: "I'm a queer transgender Latina who is ordained," she said. But she sought to put fear aside on Sunday, and said her biggest concern was "my arthritic knees."
Likewise, a veteran in the LGBTQ community standing beside her in a bit of shade on the hot morning, David Rothenberg, 89, focused on the joy of the event. "It has the dynamics of early coming out -- it's complicated, but it's exhilarating," he said.
Anania Williams from Chicago, who identifies as gender fluid and uses the corresponding pronouns, has shared their journey to that identity on their popular social media accounts, which has led to backlash online. The parade is a respite, a place to be "queer and happy," they said.
"Everyone's allowed to change," they said.
Conservative-led boycotts against companies that once embraced Pride festivities, like Target and Anheuser Busch, have led to billions of dollars of corporate losses. The backlash has also entered the 2024 presidential race, as Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida has staked his Republican primary hopes on opposition to L.G.B.T.Q. rights and has clashed with corporations, like Disney, that support them.
Heritage of Pride, which organizes the march, recognized the worsening political climate in an open letter earlier this month that was co-signed with the organizers of dozens of other Pride events across the country. In it, they warned that the L.G.B.T.Q. community was "under threat" and criticized "fair weather friends" in corporate America.
"Despite the progress we have made together, we are currently under siege," the organizers wrote. "An alarming rise in legal disruptions and targeted intimidation by extremist groups at these events, across the United States, is making our celebratory gatherings feel less safe. The threats are becoming tangible, terrifying and can no longer be ignored."
Those threats have taken many forms.
Across the country, a wave of state legislation has targeted L.G.B.T.Q. young people in particular, banning transgender health care for minors and barring teachers from discussing gay and transgender topics in schools.
In a report released last week, two civil rights groups documented more than 350 acts of anti-L.G.B.T.Q. harassment, vandalism or violence in the United States between June 2022 and April 2023, with more than half explicitly referring to gay or transgender people as pedophiles.
Some of those incidents have been deadly. Last week, a man was charged with plotting a mass shooting and bomb attack on Nashville Pride. Such a plan was carried out by a shooter in Colorado who killed five people and injured 17 more at a gay bar last November, in what prosecutors have said was a hate crime.
That same month, anxieties were high in New York after a gay bar had its window smashed by bricks four times in one month. Weeks later, the office of a gay New York City Council member was vandalized by opponents of Drag Story Time, who then vandalized his home and assaulted his neighbor.
Even the site of Stonewall Inn, the site of the 1969 riots, has not been spared. In the last month, vandals have struck the national monument outside the bar four times, snapping dozens of its rainbow flags in half.
"Pride feels different this year," said Erik Bottcher, the City Council member whose home and office were vandalized, and who represents the neighborhood that contains the Stonewall Monument.
"In the past year, there has been an increase in the level of venom that is spewed at our community," he said. "The rhetoric has been ratcheted up online, at school board meetings and even in Congress. That kind of rhetoric manifests itself in the real world."
Meanwhile, debates within the L.G.B.T.Q. community over whether corporations' embrace of Pride diluted the event's political roots have given way to a far different reality, as brands back away from that strategy after withering attacks from conservative activists and media figures.
Since April, three companies that released Pride merchandise or partnered with L.G.B.T.Q. influencers -- Target, Anheuser-Busch and Kohl's -- have lost more than $ 28 billion in market value, according to an analysis by Axios.
The Los Angeles Dodgers, which was criticized by both liberals and conservatives as it publicly waffled over whether to honor a drag troupe this month, saw thousands of protesters descend upon its stadium when it decided to invite the drag queens after all.
And after festooning its stores in rainbow bunting for years, Starbucks declined to decorate for Pride this year at stores in 21 states, according to an employee union.
New York was one of those states. On a recent tour of Starbucks locations in Manhattan, reporters found no Pride decorations in neighborhoods known for their large L.G.B.T.Q. populations, including Chelsea and Greenwich Village.
Even the Starbucks one block from the Stonewall Inn was rainbow-free.

Perks Rise As Offices Push R.T.O.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The next stage of getting workers back at their desks includes incentives like $ 10 to the charity of their choice -- and consequences like poor performance evaluations if they don't make the trek in.
Manny Medina, the chief executive of a Seattle-based artificial intelligence sales company, doesn't mind repeating himself. It comes with the territory, after all. That tolerance proved convenient this year as he faced the same question innumerable times.
Wait, so why was it you wanted us back in the office?
The engineers reminded him of their commutes. The working parents reminded him of school pickup times. Mr. Medina replied with arguments he has delineated so often that they have come to feel like personal mantras: Being near each other makes the work better. Mr. Medina approached three years of mushy remote-plus-office work as an experiment. His takeaway was that ideas bubble up more organically in the clamor of the office.
"You can interrupt each other without being rude when you're in person," said Mr. Medina, whose company, Outreach, is now in the office on a hybrid basis. "In a Zoom conversation, you have to let somebody finish their thought."
For tens of millions of office workers, it's been three years of scattershot plans for returning to in-person work -- summoning people in, not really meaning it, everybody pretty much working wherever they pleased. Now, for the umpteenth time, businesses are ready to get serious.
A wave of companies called workers back to the office this spring and summer: Disney said four days a week, Amazon swung with three (prompting a walkout from corporate workers), Meta and Lyft are aiming for September deadlines for many of their employees. Others devised new tactics to ensure their return-to-office policies stuck. Google, which has asked most workers to be in the office three days a week, announced that performance reviews could take into account lengthy unexplained absences from the office, and badge records could be reviewed to identify those consistent absences, said Ryan Lamont, a company spokesman.
Google employees will be granted the ability to work remotely only on an extremely rare basis. "We want to see Googlers connecting and collaborating in person, so we're limiting remote work to exception only," Mr. Lamont said.
These new policies come as business leaders accept that hybrid work is a permanent reality, with just over a quarter of full workdays in the country now done at home, and offices still at half their prepandemic occupancy. (Though that 50 percent occupancy metric combines Tuesdays and Wednesdays, when offices are bustling, with Fridays, when they tend to be ghost towns.)
Salesforce, the business software behemoth, announced that for a 10-day period, it will give a $ 10 charitable donation per day on behalf of any employee who comes into the office (or for remote employees who attend company events). A spokeswoman said it was only natural the company would want to find moments for "doing well and doing good." But to some employees, it might feel like a tonal shift, given that the company's previous workplace plans were announced with fanfare for a future in which much of its staff could be fully or partially remote forever. (The company emphasized that this remains the case.)
"An immersive workspace is no longer limited to a desk in our Towers," the company wrote in a February 2021 memo. "The 9-to-5 workday is dead."
It was very much alive on a recent Monday at Salesforce Tower in New York, as a hum of activity filled the 41-story building looming over Bryant Park. Desks and conference rooms were filled with employees, some of them visiting from San Francisco for the company's A.I.-focused day. In the top-floor lounge, workers stood in line waiting for coffee, as Salesforce's catering team prepared shrimp tacos for an office event that week.
Scattered throughout the office were the company's animal mascots. Brandy the fox represents marketing. Astro the astronaut sat behind a piano in the 41st floor lounge. Codey the bear stood guard near the developers.
"It's the impromptu-ness of in-person -- so for example, I was at the office and there was somebody from Chicago, she was in the San Francisco office -- 'Oh do you have time to go and chat and have a meeting about a strategy that we're rolling out?"' said Nathalie Scardino, Salesforce's global head of talent strategy. "Inevitably, as a high-tech company, you have to keep changing to meet the needs of the business, of the customer."
It's not often that the entire white-collar business world gets thrown into an impromptu experiment -- executives left to discern how to make multimillion-dollar decisions in between bursts of "you're on mute," employees figuring out how to forge friendships and nudge mentors for advice while sitting next to piles of their laundry.
And for the last three years, some office decision-making has come to feel like parents scrambling to impose rules on an unruly home: "Do this." "Why?" "Because I said so." But now some business leaders say that the results of their remote work experiment are in. They feel emphatically that they need some in-person time. After months of layoffs, especially in tech, their next business moves feel particularly consequential.
"When the economy was warm, executives thought, 'I'd really like to have people back but it's OK because I have this margin of error,"' said Mark Ein, chairman of Kastle, the security firm whose "back to work barometer" made it a pandemic celebrity. "Now that things are tougher, they want to hunker down and have their people in the office."
DocuSign, which has more than 6,500 employees spread across the globe, became a poster child for the lurching back-and-forth over return-to-office planning. The company had hoped to call employees back in May 2020, then August 2020, then October 2021, then January 2022. Then the plans disintegrated altogether.
But this month, much of the company finally came back to the office. Since February, executives have evaluated every role at the company and decided roughly 70 percent were hybrid, meaning people would be partly in the office and partly remote, 30 percent were fully remote and under 1 percent were fully in the office. Jennifer Christie, the company's new chief people officer, absorbed dozens of questions from concerned employees.
"This can be a very polarizing subject," she said, adding that she views this summer as a period of experimentation in which she and other company leaders will evaluate what parts of their hybrid plan need changing. "We're running water through pipes that haven't had water run through them in a long time. So where are there going to be leaks?"
But Docusign's leaders were ready, she added, to stop talking about how to get people back in the office and start making their plans real. "We could debate it forever, we could speculate about what's going to happen forever, but the best way for us to understand how this will impact our culture and productivity and collaboration is to just start doing it."
It's been a long period of choose-your-own-adventure style workplace planning, and the shift companies have made toward firmer deadlines has taken some recruiters by surprise. Jasmine Silver, who runs a recruitment firm specializing in mothers hoping to re-enter the work force, found that in the last few months, many of her clients transitioned abruptly from fully remote to either hybrid or entirely in-office work. The transition was jarring for some workers, especially those who had moved far from their offices, or had become attached to new work-from-home habits.
And it's healthy for people to be able to express those frustrations, psychologists said.
"What appears to be a grumbling or complaint is in many cases a request for understanding," said Tracy Maylett, an organizational psychologist. "When you look at change, the most dangerous people are people who are quiet, because you don't know what they're thinking. You can't address their concerns."
The period of hand-wringing also tends to be temporary, judging by those companies now settled in their hybrid routines. Asana, for example, the productivity software firm, asked employees to come in at least on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays starting in 2022.
For months, return to office, or R.T.O., was a big topic of office conversation. Everybody had questions, and they were all directed toward Anna Binder, the head of human resources.
"Before we R.T.O.'d -- I love that that's now in the Webster Dictionary -- it was a topic of conversation because R.T.O. was theoretical, and being on the other side of the pandemic was theoretical," Ms. Binder said. "Most people came, returned and are here. Some people tried it, decided, 'It's not for me,' and they left."
Now, Ms. Binder continued, the issue doesn't really come up. Return to office isn't a hypothetical scenario. It's their reality. And they have so much else to talk about.
"Somebody on my team just recently fell in love with somebody, and she came in one day and it was like, 'What is going on with you?"' Ms. Binder said. "She got so red and she was like, 'My whole life has changed.' To share that moment with another human being -- it was really emotional."

Dancing, Jubilation and Worries About LGBTQ Rights at Pride March

NEW YORK — An unbroken parade of marchers — some dancing and jubilant, some set with determined purpose — filled Fifth Avenue and the streets of Greenwich Village in Manhattan on Sunday for the New York City Pride March, even as a foreboding backdrop from threats both local and national hung over the day’s slate of events.
The march, with its flags and bright floats, marks the 1969 Stonewall riot that spurred the modern LGBTQ rights movement. It is the largest of its kind in the United States, with 75,000 marchers and roughly 2 million spectators, according to organizers.

America Is Honestly Very Funny: [Op-Ed]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/america-is-honestly-very-funny/docview/2829133838/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The modern women's movement was so transformative that it's easy to forget the old days in the 1960s and '70s, when the other side was good at portraying us as man-hating harpies and it was a challenge to make women feel comfortable being in the fight.
Then we discovered that in this country, a spoonful of humor could help make the message palatable. Enter writers like Nora Ephron, a fighter for the cause who was a genius at using wit to handle any woe.
"The Most of Nora Ephron" is a tome that includes so much of what she published, from current affairs journalism to food blogging to Broadway plays. She shows us who we are and how we got there and makes you wish she were still here to write about the future.
Nora came out of the old world; when she was a White House intern, she proudly took her then-fiancé on a tour, and when they came to the end of all the fabulous, historic rooms, he told her, "No wife of mine is going to work in a place like this." But she figured out how to get around every barrier with humor as her weapon. Her second husband, Carl Bernstein, was the star of a famous Washington sex scandal; she turned her role as betrayed wife into the best-selling novel and movie "Heartburn."
"The Most" shows Nora's gift for making the enemies of free speech, reproductive rights and all-purpose social progress look silly. Which, truly, they hate more than anything.
For those of us who knew Nora, the essays are a great reminder of the way she combined a serious attempt to improve the world with dedication to creating the best possible cocktail party. Truly, we want them both. I remember joining her in trying to get deep into "The Golden Notebook," Doris Lessing's cerebral feminist novel, and feeling so rewarded when the discussion kinda turned into a celebrity gossip session.
In "The Most," you'll find observations on modern life from the personal and pragmatic ("There's a reason why 40, 50 and 60 don't look the way they used to, and it's not because of feminism, or better living through exercise. It's because of hair dye") to the very political. "I hope that you choose not to be a lady," she told the 1996 graduates at her alma mater, Wellesley. "I hope you will find some way to break the rules and make a little trouble out there. And I also hope that you will choose to make some of that trouble on behalf of women."
"The Most of Nora Ephron" is certainly not all about politics, and you may find some opinions you disagree with -- pretty impossible to have as many as she did and not come up with a conflict or two.
But it never dwindles. It ends in two lists: "What I Won't Miss" and "What I Will Miss." The things she knew she'd miss range from her kids and her husband Nick Pileggi to "Pride and Prejudice" and pie. The stuff she wouldn't includes bills, email and -- talk about a woman ahead of her time -- Clarence Thomas.
Humor is a great coping mechanism, sure. And coping mechanisms are important; you have to survive the present before you can build the future. But "The Most" is a reminder that it's also a political strategy. Pointing out how ridiculous the status quo is breaks its spell and gives us the freedom to dream up something better. Imagine what she'd say now about library book banning or the latest abortion battle or -- oh, wow -- the governor of Florida's war on Disney.

Microsoft Could Abandon Its Deal With Activision: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Browning, Kellen; Mccabe, David

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A five-day hearing over Microsoft's $ 70 billion acquisition, which the Federal Trade Commission hopes to block, began Thursday in federal court.
The first day of a weeklong hearing that could determine the outcome of Microsoft's $ 70 billion acquisition of the video game giant Activision Blizzard opened Thursday with a promise from Microsoft: If a federal judge grants an injunction that would delay the deal's closing, Microsoft could abandon the deal altogether.
"This is going to decide whether the deal goes forward," said Beth Wilkinson, Microsoft's lead lawyer. She added that a loss could force the company into a "three-year administrative nightmare" that would sink the transaction, which it hopes to close by July 18.
That set the stakes for the hearing in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, where the Federal Trade Commission began laying out its case that Microsoft's acquisition of Activision -- and its popular games like Call of Duty -- would be devastating for the video game industry.
The F.T.C. is asking Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley for a preliminary injunction, which would bar Microsoft from completing the deal before the F.T.C. had the chance to argue the case in its internal court.
The clash is broadly seen as a test of whether recent efforts to more aggressively curb the power of tech giants around the world will succeed. Lina Khan, the chair of the F.T.C., has argued that big tech companies have vast influence over online commerce and communication, allowing them to engage in anticompetitive practices that harm consumers.
"If this deal is completed, the combined company will have and is likely to have the ability and incentive to harm competition in various markets related to consoles, subscription services and cloud," James Weingarten, the F.T.C.'s lead lawyer, said in court on Thursday.
Mr. Weingarten said Microsoft could make Activision's games exclusive to its Xbox console, or degrade their quality on other platforms to make the Xbox more appealing to gamers. He pointed to Microsoft's $ 7.5 billion purchase of ZeniMax Media and its slate of game studios in 2020, after which Microsoft made some of those games exclusive to Xbox. The F.T.C. pointed to an agreement made between Disney and ZeniMax to produce a game about Indiana Jones for multiple consoles. After Microsoft bought ZeniMax, the agreement was amended and the game became exclusive to Xbox. It was an indication, the F.T.C. appeared to be arguing, that Microsoft could make future Activision games exclusive to Xbox, even amending existing deals to do so.
The F.T.C. has argued that absorbing Activision's games into Microsoft's portfolio would also give it an unfair edge in the nascent market for cloud gaming.
Sony, which makes the rival PlayStation console, has been a vocal critic of the deal, and has said that PlayStation gamers could lose access to Call of Duty -- an enormous franchise that has earned more than $ 30 billion in lifetime revenue -- if Microsoft decided to make the game exclusive to Xbox. Microsoft has denied that it would do so.
Microsoft said the Activision deal would instead be good for consumers, expanding their ability to play Activision's games through low-cost options like Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service, or through the platforms of other companies like Nintendo and Nvidia, with which it has struck deals.
Ms. Wilkinson also argued that it would be nonsensical for Microsoft to remove Call of Duty and other titles from PlayStation because the company would lose out on a huge chunk of the game's revenue. She said Sony had become the "complainer in chief" in the case, and showed an email from Sony's chief executive, Jim Ryan, suggesting that he did not really believe Microsoft would withhold Call of Duty. Microsoft also pointed to its acquisition of Mojang, which produces Minecraft. It has continued to allow Minecraft to be available across platforms.
The F.T.C. has in another lawsuit accused Meta, Facebook's parent company, of cutting off nascent competitors when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp. On Wednesday, it sued Amazon over allegations that the company tricked users into signing up for its Prime subscription service. But the F.T.C. has had setbacks: Its challenge to Meta's purchase of a virtual reality start-up fell apart this year after a judge declined to stop the deal from closing.
The F.T.C. initially challenged Microsoft's bid for Activision using an in-house court. But that court does not have the legal authority to stop the deal. The F.T.C. asked the federal court to step in this month, saying it feared Microsoft would try to complete the deal despite the legal challenges.
The hearing in Judge Corley's courtroom could be a decisive test for the F.T.C. If Microsoft wins, it will signal that there are weaknesses in the F.T.C. case and could cause the agency to drop its challenge to the deal. But a win for the F.T.C. would be a sign that its broader challenge has legs, and could put new pressure on Microsoft and Activision to reconsider the multibillion-dollar corporate marriage.
Though most governments around the world, including the European Union, have approved the acquisition, Microsoft was dealt a setback in April when a British regulatory authority blocked it. That decision is under appeal.
The high-profile list of witnesses expected to testify before Judge Corley over the next week includes Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, and Bobby Kotick, the chief executive of Activision. Mr. Ryan, the chief executive of Sony, will appear via a prerecorded video deposition.

Cinderella, Liberated (Again): [Review]

Full text: The Britney Spears jukebox musical, about fairy tale princesses fighting for their emancipation, comes up short as a narrative of feminist awakening.
The Britney Spears jukebox musical "Once Upon a One More Time" is not a bio-show recounting the singer's life. Rather, it retrofits two dozen of her songs -- including "Oops! ... I Did It Again," "Womanizer," "Toxic," "Gimme More" and, of course, " ... Baby One More Time" -- to tell the story of a fair-haired princess who, realizing she has been played by a handsome rogue and controlled by an omnipresent father figure, rises up and fights for her emancipation.
Hmm, maybe the (fully authorized) apple does not fall far from the tree.
But this big, splashy show, which is quite entertaining at times, is hampered by a shambolic jumble of sisterhood 101 messaging and defanged fantasy revisionism. Rewriting classic yarns with a pop-feminist spin has become big business, with Disney updating its operating system one property at a time, and princesses and fairy tales calcifying into common tropes of empowerment pep on Broadway -- think "Frozen," "Aladdin," "Bad Cinderella" or, for an artistically successful example, "Head Over Heels."
"Once Upon a One More Time" banks on a familiar figure, Cinderella (Briga Heelan), who here is starting to feel vaguely antsy about her life. She and her fellow storybook heroines -- Snow White (Aisha Jackson), Princess Pea (Morgan Whitley), Rapunzel (Gabrielle Beckford), Sleeping Beauty (Ashley Chiu) and Little Mermaid (Lauren Zakrin) -- are bossed around by an imperious Narrator (Adam Godley, for whom this must feel like a vacation after "The Lehman Trilogy"). He is basically a domineering stage manager acting on behalf of the patriarchy.
Although Cinderella is supposed to be content in the happy-ever-after, her loneliness just might be killing her. But shush, pretty lady, push these thoughts out of your lovely head: As her prince (Justin Guarini) soothingly informs her, "You're paid to be pretty, and I'm paid to be charming."
"What do you mean, paid?" Cinderella replies. "I don't get paid."
So he tries to put her off the scent by singing "Make Me," as one does.
Luckily, Cinderella gets a fortuitous visit from the Notorious O.F.G. (Original Fairy Godmother, played by Brooke Dillman), who gives her the key to understanding her existential malaise: Betty Friedan's "The Feminine Mystique." (It's a choice that will puzzle those who have moved on to more recent feminist waves; then again, Jon Hartmere's book also includes a Howard Stern joke, so insert shrug emoji.)
But before Cinderella has a chance to really dig in, the Stepmother (Jennifer Simard, last seen in "Company") seizes the book. To retrieve it and ultimately become her own woman, our heroine enrolls her similarly shackled princess buddies from Scroll Club, where they read their own stories, for some consciousness raising.
Much of the excitement here is generated by the choreography of Keone and Mari Madrid, who also directed the production (with an assist from David Leveaux, credited as the creative consultant). The couple, who created the Off Broadway hip-hop dance drama "Beyond Babel" in 2020, got their break in music videos, which may be why the large ensemble numbers shine brightest: tight formation extravaganzas that heavily rely on popping and locking, and incorporate elaborate hand movement. An occasional wink to Spears's video oeuvre doesn't hurt, either.
And though the numbers for " ... Baby One More Time," "Circus" and "Crazy" look fantastic, the one-size-fits-most staging can become repetitive, and is not as effective in those moments when a less in-your-face approach is needed.
Worse, the songs often barely suit the story, even with some tweaked lyrics. Exceptions include Cinderella's stepsisters (Ryann Redmond and Tess Soltau) commanding her to "Work Bitch." The Max Martin jukebox musical "& Juliet," which is playing a thousand feet away and features five Spears hits, integrates book and songs with less visible seams and more wit.
Fully embracing arena-pop aesthetics (with flashy lighting by Kenneth Posner and scenic design by Anna Fleischle that relies on elements that can easily be dropped down or wheeled in and out), "Once Upon a One More Time" almost always falls back on supersizing. Half the numbers end with a subwoofer boom that will rattle your insides. And the jokes come in three flavors: broad, broader and annoying. A running gag, for example, has Snow White comically misspelling the simplest words, even though she is part of Scroll Club so one assumes that she can at least read.
Two of the actors have embraced opposite ways of adjusting to this heightened reality. Simard delivers the single most original performance: She barely changes her expression, her face frozen in a heavily made-up mask of disdain, and her Stepmother feels as if Moira Rose from "Schitt's Creek" and Norma Desmond had spawned a villainess crooning a slowed-down "Toxic."
Guarini, on the other hand, banks on expansiveness as a prince generously sharing his charms with a bevy of women. He displays a gift for slapstick -- watch the way he elastically climbs onto a platform two stairs at a time -- and spares no effort, whether in solo songs or leading big numbers.
It is actually surprising that his character has so many songs while most of the princesses are reduced to extras without distinctive personalities. (A gay couple even barges in during the "million princess march.") Snow White rises above the fray, thanks to Jackson's humor, vocal chops and high-energy charisma, and Whitley's tart delivery helps sell Pea's few lines, but Heelan's Cinderella feels a little bland. Making matters worse, the sound localization is so bad that you can't distinguish the women's voices in their ensemble numbers. (The sound design is by Andrew Keister, costumes and hair by Loren Elstein.)
Incongruously, Cin and Snow, as they like to call each other, share an intense duet, "Brightest Morning Star" (was "I'm a Slave 4 U" just too much?), but it's a gratuitous throwaway with no follow-up. I guess nobody talks about what happens after Scroll Club.
This timidity is but one example of the ways in which the show comes up short, both as a feminist text and as a tribute to Spears's songbook -- and, yes, her life. The last thing her fans might have expected from a Britney Spears musical is dutiful conventionality.

Full text: A math prodigy channels the spirit of his rapper father in this lively musical.
"World's Best," from the director Roshan Sethi, is a vibrant kid's musical set to a simple beat. The seventh grade calculus prodigy Prem Patel (Manny Magnus) longs to be as cool and confident as his dad, Suresh (Utkarsh Ambudkar), a rapper who died of cancer when the boy was five years old. Prem's mother, Priya (Punam Patel), is proud to raise a mathlete -- until Prem slips on his father's gold chain necklace and dad magically appears to inspire him to bust a rhyme at the school talent show. "I'm like a memory remixed with a fantasy," Suresh says with a grin. I'd go with hype man or hype ghost.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Suresh performed in the aughts, but wears '90s Timberlands and worships the '80s hitmaker Doug E. Fresh. Maybe the whiz kid can calculate the rate at which nostalgia flattens time? Yet, the script, by Ambudkar and Jamie King, is otherwise attuned to the emotional and comedic details, like when Priya seeks solace in a podcast on grief only to be interrupted by an ad for oat milk.
Still, we're here for the music which builds from subtle, classroom-rattling percussion -- imagine the sound of pencils clacking on retainers -- to a Hype Williams homage filmed in a five-sided cube with a fisheye lens. The rapping is great but the lyrics are strained ("Think Pythagoras meets Dr. Seuss/Square my sides to find my hypotenuse") and the music is tinny and canned. I think Sethi wants to emphasize that these ditties are fantasies, but the overall effect is too phony. What works is the high energy, kooky cast who fling themselves into the carefree choreography -- especially Magnus, a mugging, contagious delight.
World's Best
Rated PG. Running time: 1 hour 41 minutes. Watch on Disney+.

Full text: "Once Upon a One More Time" is bringing hits like "Toxic" and "Circus" to Broadway. Will Spears's fiercely protective base embrace it?
The book writer for "Once Upon a One More Time," the Britney Spears jukebox musical opening on Broadway Thursday night, often returns to a memory from five years ago, when Spears sat in a Manhattan theater a few rows in front of him and watched an early reading of the show.
"I was just watching her and it was like, 'Is she going to like this?"' the writer, Jon Hartmere, said recently, recalling his relief whenever he saw Spears clap along or smile as one of her songs came on. "It was pure delight."
A campy fairy-tale spoof that sidesteps the bio-musical formula to focus on a cast of disillusioned Disney princesses and storybook protagonists, "Once Upon a One More Time" is the latest in a long line of jukebox musicals that have plumbed the catalogs of acts including Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, Michael Jackson, Tina Turner and the Temptations in pursuit of box office gold.
With a track list stacked with hits such as "Stronger," "Toxic" and "Circus," the show has the potential for boffo success, but it also faces unique challenges. Originally conceived when Spears was under a conservatorship that gave her father vast control over her life, the production has assured fans that the show was fully authorized by the pop star herself after she was freed from the arrangement. But it is unclear how much her fiercely loyal fan base -- whose activism helped fuel the unraveling of the conservatorship -- will embrace it. It would likely only take one spirited comment from Spears, a 41-year-old star with a reputation for unfiltered and unpredictable social media posts, to win or lose that audience.
Fans inside and outside the production have been keeping a close eye on Spears's famously active Instagram account to see if she opines on the show (she hasn't, yet). And cast and crew members have sought assurances internally that the production's profits are benefiting Spears herself, rather than her former managers or her father, James P. Spears, who was named her conservator amid concerns about her mental health and went on to exercise control over her personal life and finances for more than a decade, even as she continued to perform.
"As artists, we just want her to be able to make her own decisions and to live her life the way she hoped to," said Keone Madrid, who directed and choreographed the show with his creative partner and wife, Mari Madrid. "We all yearn to honor her work."
Hunter Arnold, one of the show's lead producers, said Spears signed the contract herself after the conservatorship was terminated and that no one else in Spears's camp currently has a deal to receive profits.
A representative for Spears did not make her available for an interview but confirmed the timing of the most recent deal and added that the singer had provided notes in response to videos of the Madrids' choreography.
The opening comes at a time when Spears's life has continued to be the subject of gossip items. Since the legal arrangement was terminated, Spears has announced her marriage to Sam Asghari, something she had said she was not able to do under the conservatorship, and briefly returned to the music industry, releasing a track with Elton John. The legal battle over winding down the conservatorship has continued in Los Angeles, where her lawyers have lodged objections to some of the accounting during the conservatorship years.
Within the production, the desire to please Spears has sometimes meant seizing on the dribs and drabs of information that they get from representatives of a reclusive megastar.
Britney likes fairy tales? The show is based in a world where Cinderella, Snow White and Rapunzel are friends. Britney loves butterflies? The production made props of the insects and made the show's branding into what looks like butterfly-shaped rainbow floodlights, which theatergoers can pose with outside the theater. ("That might be an example of where we had tried to lean in too hard," Hartmere said of the show's monthlong tryout in Washington, D.C., noting that the show had gotten rid of a "butterfly vortex" for the Broadway production.)
"The spirit of it has always been serving her desires," Arnold said.
Because of revelations around how Spears's father and former management company benefited financially from the conservatorship, the musical's financial structure has been a central point of scrutiny for some fans.
Initially, production papers from late 2019 listed a company called Shiloh Standing, Inc., which was started by Spears's father shortly after the creation of the conservatorship, as being entitled to 7.5 percent of the production's net profits, according to documents filed with New York State's attorney general's office. Larry Rudolph, Spears's former manager, was also slated to receive funds, including a $ 30,000 executive producer fee, plus $ 1,500 per week.
But plans for a short run in Chicago in 2020, followed by a Broadway transfer, were scuttled by the pandemic, the show was put on hold and, in that time, Spears's world was transformed. Leslie Papa, a spokeswoman for the show, said that Spears's contract was negotiated and signed in 2022, after the termination of the conservatorship, and provides all compensation directly to her.
Arnold said Spears has a stake in the show's royalties through music licensing proceeds, in addition to an underlying rights deal, which he said was carved out in recognition of her role in popularizing the music, even if other lyricists and music producers own much of the rights to the songs. He declined to specify the exact payment structure for Spears, and it is not included in government filings thus far.
According to a copy of a 2022 budget for the Broadway musical that was shared with The New York Times by someone who was not authorized to discuss the production, the advance payment for the underlying rights deal associated with the show was $ 80,000. Arnold noted that with successful Broadway shows, royalties often quickly outpace initial advances.
So far some of the biggest social media accounts associated with the movement to end the conservatorship, known as #FreeBritney, have said little about the musical, especially in contrast to the fan excitement around the Elton John collaboration.
But many of the ticket holders at previews at the Marquis Theater are quick to label themselves as devoted Britney fans, and they react with delight at the show's many knowing references to the pop star, which include a snippet of the original choreography from "Oops! ... I Did It Again" that tends to make the audience erupt. Because they spent their early teenage years internalizing Spears's dancing on MTV, the Madrids, who are known for their narrative choreography and staccato isolations, consider themselves "natural extensions of her and her work."
"Her music has always been around in my life in one way or another," Mari Madrid said.
Those references are like a running inside joke that most of the audience seems to understand. The crowd doesn't hear the word "Britney" through the entire show -- it's only at the end that the speakers blast the pop star's most famous opening line: "It's Britney, bitch." None of the show's official merchandise carries Spears's image, but one fast-selling tote bag proclaims, "It's Broadway, bitch."
Nelson Saavedra Jr., the owner of the #FreeBritney page on Reddit, has opted to support the show and has attended two preview performances already, noting that any direct assessment from Spears would influence his own thinking on it.
"Britney signed the deal after she was free so let's just move on and take that at face value," Saavedra said. "Of course, that would change tomorrow if she said, 'Please don't go see this play."'
Audience members can be forgiven for thinking that the musical's central theme -- a cohort of famed damsels in distress taking control of their own lives -- is some grand metaphor for Spears's release from the conservatorship, but Hartmere said the parallels are just coincidence.
"It's this story about women learning what they can and should have out of life," Hartmere said. "That's always been the story from the get-go."
For Hartmere, returning to that memory of Spears watching that early performance also engenders some anxiety: What if she ends up disappointed that some songs did not make the final cut? The show's creators could not figure out how to make the risqué lyrics from her 2016 track "Clumsy" fit for children, so the song was removed.
Right now, the creators can only wait to see if Spears decides to attend a performance -- which, they acknowledge, is anyone's best guess.

Filmmaker's Obsession Feeds Mystique of Deep: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Cameron's 1997 movie "Titanic" reinvigorated interest in the ill-fated ocean liner, feeding the mystique that spurs some wealthy experience chasers.
James Cameron, the Academy Award-winning movie director behind "Titanic," knows about the risks of deep ocean exploration. A seasoned underwater explorer himself, in 2012 he prepared to plummet nearly seven miles to the world's deepest known ocean trench.
"You're going into one of the most unforgiving places on earth," he said in an interview with The New York Times shortly before setting off: "It's not like you can call up AAA to come get you."
Yet he wanted to take the risk. Seeing things "human beings have never seen before," he said that year in another interview, was more thrilling than filmmaking. "Forget about red carpets and all that glitzy stuff," he added.
This week, in the days since a submersible vessel carrying five people disappeared on an expedition to see the Titanic's remains, many movie fans have been waiting for Cameron to give his take on the situation.
Cameron's 1997 movie "Titanic," which made over $ 2 billion at the box office to become one of the highest-grossing movies of all time, reinvigorated interest in the tale of the ill-fated luxury liner, feeding the mystique that spurs some wealthy experience chasers to head miles underwater to see the wreckage site. Cameron has made dozens of visits to that spot in the North Atlantic, and knows the terrain well.
Cameron did not immediately respond to a request for comment made through Disney, which distributed his most recent film, "Avatar: The Way of Water."
But in past interviews, Cameron has revealed many of the psychological factors that drive explorers to visit shipwrecks, despite the risks, and has also explained why adventurers feel the need to see the Titanic's ruins with their own eyes.
"I love shipwrecks," he said in a documentary released with a DVD edition of "Titanic," and R.M.S. Titanic was "the ultimate wreck."
Cameron has said that, as a boy, he became obsessed with heading deep below the sea. "I can think of no greater fantasy than to be an explorer and see what no human eye has seen before," he said in a 2011 Times interview.
In 1988, while making "The Abyss," about a drowned nuclear submarine, Cameron learned to operate a remotely piloted submersible. Then, in 1995, before he had even written the "Titanic" script, he visited the ship's wreck to film it for that movie.
Cameron captured the footage by going underwater in Russian-owned submersible vessels. His brother, Michael, a mechanical engineer, constructed a special casing for a 35-millimeter movie camera so that it could withstand the water pressure at two-and-a-half miles below sea level.
In the years since, the director has repeated that trip to the Titanic wreckage and become a major figure in the field of deep sea exploration. "I've owned and operated my own submarines and pretty much know everybody in the deep-ocean world outside of the oil business," he told The Times in 2010. That year, he brought together a panel of underwater technology experts to advise the Obama administration on dealing with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
Cameron also directed the documentary features "Deepsea Challenge 3D," about a 2012 trip to the bottom of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific, and "Aliens of the Deep," an exploration of the strange, subaquatic creatures that live in the ocean's depths.
In February, he released "Titanic: 25 Years Later With James Cameron," a documentary streaming on Hulu, which tries to answer some frequently debated fan questions about the movie, including whether the characters Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) could have survived by climbing onto a wooden door that floats in the ocean in a key scene.
Such thought experiments are worthwhile, Cameron says in the documentary. "If nothing else, it gives you an appreciation of what those people went through," he said.

This Award Show Ramps Up the Silly: [Style Desk]

Full text: At the second annual "Las Culturistas" Culture Awards, the comedians Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers put on an affectionate and over-the-top parody of an award show.
At the "Las Culturistas" Culture Awards on Saturday night, the winner of the Cate Blanchett Award for Good Acting was ... Cate Blanchett.
Ms. Blanchett had sent in an acceptance video in which she fell dramatically to her knees in a swirl of confetti. It played on a screen at Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center to cheers and laughter from the crowd.
Ms. Blanchett was in on the joke of the evening: Beneath their sequins and sense of self-importance, award shows are kind of funny.
At least Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers, the comedians and hosts of the podcast "Las Culturistas," think so. They celebrated and spoofed the festivities at their second annual Culture Awards, a comedy show dressed up in the stiff tuxedo of an award show.
There were more than 100 trophies to hand out, including in the categories Most Amazing Impact in Film (winner: M3GAN) and Best Skill to Have (winner: "a sense of play," which triumphed over "changing a tire").
A crowd of 2,600 people attended the free event despite a sprinkling of rain. Wearing neon claw clips and Kendall Roy T-shirts, the attendees swayed along to the song "Padam Padam" by Kylie Minogue. Naomi McPherson, one-third of the band MUNA, said the audience had "more gay people than I've ever seen in my life."
Comedians, including D'Arcy Carden, Patti Harrison, Sarah Sherman and Ego Nwodim, helped the hosts reconstruct every trick in the award show playbook, from envelope fumbling to feigning surprise upon being announced as a winner.
"For those of you that don't know what's in store for tonight, the vibe is going to be megachurch but harmless," Mr. Yang said in the opening monologue he delivered with Mr. Rogers. Moments later, he swapped his Marni suit for a bedsheet to perform a choreographed rendition of "Breathe" by Faith Hill.
In an interview, the pair said the parody came from a place of love. Mr. Yang, 32, and Mr. Rogers, 33, were both 7 when they watched "Titanic" dominate the 1998 Oscars. "The glam factor and the accessibility for three hours to all these huge stars in one room was very exciting at the time," Mr. Rogers said.
The two met as freshmen at New York University and both ventured into comedy; Mr. Yang joined "Saturday Night Live," and Mr. Rogers performed with the Upright Citizens Brigade. As their careers took off, they discovered that award shows were not as glamorous as they had once appeared.
"Being there is a little dissociative," said Mr. Yang, who has been nominated for three Emmys for his work on "S.N.L." "There is something titillating and alluring about it, but something disconcerting at the same time."
Threatening to introduce a new award show became a running gag on "Las Culturistas," the pop culture podcast the two have hosted since 2016. Lincoln Center approached them about doing a live show last year, and soon, they were onstage last June, being booed for awarding Best Seltzer Flavor to Lemon Spindrift.
Mr. Yang and Mr. Rogers finalized this year's categories on a delayed flight out of Orlando, Fla., where the pair had been visiting Disney World. They chose the winners, but encouraged fans of the podcast -- or "publicists," as they call them -- to mount campaigns for their favorite nominees. One drafted a "For Your Consideration" poster for shrimp, a nominee for Most Vulnerable Prey.
Many fans arrived on Saturday with the competitive energy of an Oscars watch party. Zach Aaronson, 33, who works in theater marketing and lives in Hell's Kitchen, said he was rooting for "You Can't Stop the Beat," the finale of the musical "Hairspray," to win in the category of Biggest Number. He cheered when the song was announced as the winner, beating nominees that included the number 99 and a zillion.
"This is so stupid and silly and gay," he said. "And that's what makes it brilliant."
Two prominent Arianas -- Grande and Madix -- sent in acceptance videos. So did Andy Cohen, who beat Mr. Yang in the category Best Gay Guy -- Famous (other categories recognized gay men whose levels of renown are "normal" and "somewhere in between").
The event was "somehow even sillier than real award shows," said Hannah Caldwell, 28, a Manhattan resident who was attending for the second time.
Mr. Yang pointed out that it had been a tumultuous stretch for award shows. The Tony Awards were unscripted because of the Writers Guild of America strike, and the Oscars went without a host from 2019 to 2021. "I feel like we're in a moment where the form is being questioned and is changing," he said.
But if the Culture Awards mocked the pageantry of award shows, they also paid tribute to the mushiness at their core. Toward the end of the evening, a video montage included Marion Cotillard's acceptance speech in 2008 for the best actress Oscar for her performance in "La Vie en Rose." (She beat none other than Cate Blanchett.)
Several members of the crowd knew every word of Ms. Cotillard's breathless, over-the-top monologue. "Thank you life, thank you love," they mouthed along with her.

A Britney Spears Jukebox Musical Hopes For #SeeBritney Energy

NEW YORK — The book writer for “Once Upon a One More Time,” the Britney Spears jukebox musical opening on Broadway Thursday night, often returns to a memory from five years ago, when Spears sat in a Manhattan theater a few rows in front of him and watched an early reading of the show.
“I was just watching her, and it was like, ‘Is she going to like this?’” the writer, Jon Hartmere, said recently, recalling his relief whenever he saw Spears clap along or smile as one of her songs came on. “It was pure delight.”

The show’s creators could not figure out how to make the risqué lyrics from her 2016 track “Clumsy” fit for children, so the song was removed.
Right now, the creators can only wait to see if Spears decides to attend a performance — which, they acknowledge, is anyone’s best guess.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An Englishman with a deep, cultured voice, he played uptight snobs in films like "Back to School" and on shows like "Friends" and "Mad About You."
Paxton Whitehead, a comic actor who earned a Tony nomination for his role in a revival of "Camelot" and played the starchiest of stuffed shirts in films like the Rodney Dangerfield comedy "Back to School" and on hit 1990s sitcoms like "Friends" and "Mad About You," died on Friday in Arlington, Va. He was 85.
His daughter, Alex Whitehead-Gordon, said the cause of his death, in a hospital, was complications of a fall.
Mr. Whitehead, an Englishman with a modulated baritone voice, often coaxed humor from his sharp features and dignified bearing. His comic characters typically displayed subtly exaggerated versions of his own traits, which he executed with seeming ease.
"He couldn't help but be funny," the critic Terry Doran wrote in The Buffalo News in 1997 of Mr. Whitehead's time at the George Bernard Shaw Festival in Ontario, adding: "He didn't sweat buckets striving to make us laugh. He just was amusing. It came naturally."
For Mr. Whitehead, finding the comedy was the key that unlocked a role.
"You always have to find the core of humor in a character -- at least I like to, the same way some people will say, 'I like to find the good in him, even though he is a villain,"' he told The Los Angeles Times in 1997.
One such character was Philip Barbay, the uptight dean of a business school and the nemesis of Thornton Melon, Mr. Dangerfield's character, in "Back to School" (1986). Melon, a crass but successful businessman, comes to Grand Lakes University to visit his struggling son and winds up enrolling at the school after making a sizable donation.
Barbay hates Melon on sight and does his best to get him expelled, to little effect. Early in the movie he and his girlfriend, Diane, a literature professor played by Sally Kellerman, see Melon buying books for students at the university bookstore, and Barbay describes him as "the world's oldest living freshman, and the walking epitome of the decline in modern education."
Melon goes on to disrupt Barbay's class and date Diane.
Mr. Whitehead infused Barbay with some pathos -- the character seemed unable to keep himself from being a killjoy -- which added another layer to the humor. While out with the free-spirited, poetry-loving Diane, Barbay proposes that they take their relationship to the next level through "a merger," adding that they would become "incorporated, if you will."
Mr. Whitehead's stodgy figure in "Back to School" was the archetype for many of his later sitcom roles. He played a stuffy neighbor on "Mad About You," a stuffy boss on "Friends" and the stuffy headmaster of a prestigious school on "Frasier."
He was also a prolific theater actor. He appeared in more than a dozen Broadway productions, including the revue "Beyond the Fringe" (1962-64) and the 1980 revival of "Camelot," in which his portrayal of King Pellinore earned him a Tony nomination for best featured actor in a musical. He played Sherlock Holmes opposite Glenn Close in "The Crucifer of Blood," which ran for 236 performances at the Helen Hayes Theater in 1978 and 1979.
Mr. Whitehead's roles, especially onstage, were not always comic. One departure was his portrayal of the ambition-crazed lead in a well-reviewed production of Shakespeare's "Richard III" at the Old Globe in San Diego in 1985.
"Comedy, tragedy, pathos, spectacle -- everything is swept along before the raging kinetic power of this Richard," the theater critic Welton Jones wrote in The San Diego Union-Tribune in 1985.
Francis Edward Paxton Whitehead was born in Kent, England, on Oct. 17, 1937. His father, Charles, was a lawyer, and his mother, Louise (Hunt) Whitehead, was a homemaker. His daughter said that his family and friends had called him Paxton since he was a child.
He graduated from the Rugby School in Warwickshire before studying acting at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London. His early work was with touring companies, sometimes performing a new play every week. In the late 1950s he earned a stint with the New Shakespeare Memorial Theater, which is now called the Royal Shakespeare Theater and is part of the Royal Shakespeare Company.
"But I was the lowest of lows," he told The Los Angeles Times in 1992, and after playing Shakespearean extras for a while, he decided to move to New York City. (His mother was American, so he was allowed to work in the States.)
His Broadway career soon took off, and it continued into recent decades. He appeared in the original productions of the comedies "Noises Off" (1983-85) and "Lettice and Lovage" (1990) and in revivals of "My Fair Lady" (1993), as Colonel Pickering and later Henry Higgins, and "The Importance of Being Earnest" (2011), as the Rev. Canon Chasuble.
In 1967, Mr. Whitehead became the artistic director of the Shaw Festival. He produced, acted in or directed most of Shaw's plays, attracting actors like Jessica Tandy to the festival's productions, before deciding to return to acting in 1977.
His other films include "Jumpin' Jack Flash" (1986), which starred Whoopi Goldberg; "Baby Boom" (1987) which starred Diane Keaton and Sam Shepard; and "The Adventures of Huck Finn" (1993), which starred Elijah Wood and Courtney B. Vance. His other television appearances include "Murder, She Wrote," "3rd Rock From the Sun," "The West Wing," "Hart to Hart" and "Caroline in the City."
His marriage to the actress Patricia Gage ended in divorce in 1986. The next year he married Katherine Robertson, who died in 2009.
In addition to his daughter, with whom he lived in Arlington, he is survived by a son, Charles; a stepdaughter from his first marriage, Heather Whitehead; and four grandchildren.
Mr. Whitehead told The San Diego Union-Tribune in 1986 that he usually preferred to act in comedy, because "it interests me more, and actually I take it a great deal more seriously than I do tragedy."
"The last time I did a tragic role," he added, "they laughed."

Family in Tow, DeSantis Winks At the Age Gap: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: At 44, he is more than three decades younger than Donald Trump and Joe Biden. He is subtly playing up that age gap, even if his right-wing views leave him out of step with many younger voters.
As top-tier presidential candidates go, Ron DeSantis is something of a rarity these days. He was born after the Vietnam War, he came of age when computers were common in American homes and he still has young children of his own, rather than enough grandchildren to fill a basketball team.
Mr. DeSantis would be 46 on Inauguration Day if elected, younger than every president since John F. Kennedy. It's a fact he doesn't state explicitly, but his campaign has set out to make sure voters get it.
The Florida governor talks frequently about having the "energy and discipline" needed for the White House, keeping a busy schedule of morning and evening events. He and his wife, Casey DeSantis, often speak about their young children, who are 6, 5 and 3 and have joined their parents on the campaign trail. One of the few candidates with kids still at home, Mr. DeSantis regularly highlights his parental worries about schools and popular culture as he presses his right-wing social agenda.
When he signed the state budget on Thursday, he joked that a tax break on one of parenthood's most staggering expenses -- diapers -- had come too late for his family, though not by much.
"I came home, and my wife's like, 'Why didn't you do that in 2019 when our kids were still in diapers?"' Mr. DeSantis said.
The evident goal is to draw a stark contrast with his main rivals, President Biden, 80, and former President Donald J. Trump, who just turned 77, both grandfathers who have sons (Hunter and Don Jr.) older than Mr. DeSantis. Voters have expressed concern about the age and fitness of both men, especially Mr. Biden.
Roughly two-thirds of registered voters believe Mr. Biden is too old to effectively serve another four-year term as president, according to a national poll conducted by Quinnipiac University last month. Only 36 percent of registered voters said the same of Mr. Trump, suggesting that Mr. DeSantis's relative youth might be more of an advantage in a general election than in the primaries.
Still, Mr. DeSantis, 44, rarely talks directly about his age, and the party he represents -- older and whiter than the country at large -- has never been known for nominating young presidential candidates who ride a wave of energy to the White House, as Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama did.
His conservative views on abortion, climate change and how race is taught -- among other issues -- have left Mr. DeSantis out of step with many members of his own generation. Majorities of voters in his age bracket want abortion to be legal in all or most cases, think climate change is a very serious problem and support the Black Lives Matter movement. Only about one in four voters between the ages of 35 and 49 have a favorable view of Mr. DeSantis, according to the Quinnipiac poll.
Mr. DeSantis also hardly seems to have a natural knack for capturing youthful enthusiasm in the way that Mr. Obama did. The last major candidate to run on a platform of generational change, the 44th president was able to count on the support of young and influential cultural icons, including hip-hop artists.
Other than railing against "wokeness," Mr. DeSantis scarcely mentions cultural influences like television shows, movies, music or social media. One of his attempts to reach younger people -- announcing his campaign on Twitter with Elon Musk -- went haywire when the livestream repeatedly glitched out. His rally soundtrack is a generic mix of country and classic rock, augmented by a DeSantis tribute anthem to the tune of "Sweet Home Alabama." He doesn't talk much about his love of golf or discuss his hobbies. His references to parenthood are often prompted by his wife.
But his children -- Madison, Mason and Mamie -- are highly visible. Neat stacks of toys, including baseball bats and a bucket of baseballs, are usually arrayed on the front porch of the governor's mansion in Tallahassee, visitors say.
No presidential family has raised children as young as the DeSantis brood since the Kennedys, prompting hopes among supporters of a conservative Camelot at the White House. The comparison is one Ms. DeSantis especially seems to be leaning into. The elegant gowns and white gloves she sometimes favors have seemed to evoke the wardrobe of Jacqueline Kennedy.
The couple's family-centric image has softened views of Mr. DeSantis among some Democrats in Florida. "I don't like him as a politician," Janie Jackson, 52, a Democratic voter from Miami who runs a housekeeping business, said in an interview this past week. "But I think he's a good father and husband."
Mr. Trump, who is twice divorced and has five children with three different women, could be particularly vulnerable to such comparisons.
"Engaging with his family helps humanize him," Dave Carney, a New Hampshire-based Republican strategist, said of Mr. DeSantis. "He's a dad. People can relate to that. It gives him credibility to talk about family issues."
But voters can sniff out shtick, Mr. Carney added. "There's a balance," he said. "You don't want your kids to seem like a prop."
Younger Republicans do seem to be responding to Mr. DeSantis. A recent poll by The Economist and YouGov found that the governor received his highest level of support from Republicans and Republican leaners aged 18 to 29, although he was still trailing Mr. Trump by 39 percent to 27 percent in that group.
At almost every stop on their swings through the early nominating states, Mr. DeSantis and Ms. DeSantis, who often joins her husband onstage to deliver her own remarks, mention their young family.
On a recent trip to Iowa, Mr. DeSantis and his wife, 42, arrived at the state fairgrounds with their children in tow. All three were wearing DeSantis-branded shirts with a "Top Gov" logo on the back. They signed a bus belonging to a pro-DeSantis super PAC -- his son did so while wearing a baseball glove -- as Ms. DeSantis, sporting a black leather "Where Woke Goes to Die" jacket despite the heat, knelt down to help. Their eldest, Madison, wrote her name in red and drew a heart above it.
"Did you guys write your stuff on there?" Mr. DeSantis asked, after wading through attendees while lifting up one daughter. The kids then moved on to an ice cream giveaway organized by the super PAC.
"Want me to hold you?" Mr. DeSantis asked his son, Mason, before picking him up as the boy continued to eat ice cream.
On the stump, Mr. DeSantis usually talks about his children to emphasize policy points, particularly on education, or to accentuate his long-running feud with Disney, which he accuses of indoctrinating children.
"My wife and I just believe that kids should be able to go to school, watch cartoons, just be kids, without having some agenda shoved down their throats," Mr. DeSantis said on a visit to New Hampshire. "So we take that very seriously, and we've done an awful lot to be able to support parents."
Mr. DeSantis's approach to family issues appeals specifically to conservative Republicans and has been criticized by Democrats and civil rights activists. He has signed legislation banning abortions after six weeks, outlawing gender-transition care for minors, imposing punishments on businesses that allow children to see performances like drag shows and further limiting instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in schools.
On the campaign trail, the DeSantises often try to temper the polarizing nature of his political persona with tales of family life.
Ms. DeSantis usually coaxes her husband to open up about their kids, including his adventures taking them for fast food at a restaurant populated by inebriated college students and, in a sign of the couple's religiosity, having them baptized with water from the Sea of Galilee in Israel.
At one stop in New Hampshire, Ms. DeSantis apologized to the crowd for her raspy voice, suggesting she had strained her vocal cords in an effort to protect the furniture in the governor's mansion from one of her daughters.
"I had a very long, in-depth conversation with that 3-year-old as to why she cannot color on the dining room table with permanent markers," she said.
Now, Mr. DeSantis has competition from another youthful, if far less known, candidate from his home state: Mayor Francis Suarez of Miami, 45, whose campaign announcement video this past week shows him jogging through the city and mentioning his children.
Another lesser-known rival, Vivek Ramaswamy, has promoted himself as the first millennial to run for president as a Republican. Mr. Ramaswamy, 37, also has young children, sons ages 11 months and 3 years who have joined him on the trail. Campaigning with kids sometimes requires special accommodations, Mr. Ramaswamy said in a recent interview. His campaign bus, for instance, features two car seats and a diaper-changing table.
At the end of an event in New Hampshire this month, he turned away from the crowd to thank his older son, Karthik, for behaving so well during his speech.
"He got a bigger round of applause than I did," Mr. Ramaswamy recounted.

Shaking Things Up From Inside the Castle: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Earlier this month, Pharrell Williams was in the men's atelier on the second floor of Louis Vuitton's corporate office in Paris, sunglasses on, surveying his new perch.
"Listen," he said conspiratorially. "This window is different."
The window by his desk looks out over the small plaza on the north side of the Pont Neuf, where in just a couple of weeks, his first show as Louis Vuitton men's creative director would take place. A 50-foot statue of the artist Yayoi Kusama, a Vuitton collaborator, hovered just outside. The rapper Pusha T and the streetwear innovator Nigo were milling about.
Since Mr. Williams's appointment was announced in February, he has spent a great deal of his time here, in this office and in the workshops that abut it, getting accustomed to holding the reins of the huge business he had been put at the creative helm of -- the first time a musician has been given such a grand platform in luxury fashion.
"I pinch myself every day," he said. "This is the equivalent of a castle to me. I mean, the Seine River right there -- it's like the moat."
The long path from his childhood in Virginia Beach through hip-hop producer stardom to streetwear design impact to pop music ubiquity to here was very much on his mind. "I'm a Black man -- they have given this appointment to a Black man," he said. "This is the crown jewel of the LVMH portfolio. It's everything, and I was appointed to rule in this position. So No. 1, a ruler of a position is usually like a king. But a ruler of this position for me is a perpetual student. It's what I intend to be."
A little bit later in the afternoon, Mr. Williams, 50, slipped off his blazer and slipped on a brown motorcycle jacket in full LV monogram print leather. Emblazoned on the back, in studs, were the words "PUPIL" and "KING."
His appointment to the helm of Vuitton's men's business is, depending on your perspective, a full-throated acknowledgment of the power of Black cultural capital on a global stage and a watershed moment in the absorption of hip-hop class politics into luxury fashion. Or it's a bellwether of challenging times to come for traditionally trained clothing designers who aspire to top posts, and a suggestion that global celebrity moves the needle more than directional design, even for the most successful luxury brands.
Either way, Mr. Williams did not apply for the job -- he was chosen.
In December, Alexandre Arnault, a scion of the LVMH dynasty and a longtime friend, sent Mr. Williams a text: "Please call me. The time has come."
Mr. Williams thought Mr. Arnault was perhaps going to run some name options by him for the Vuitton job. "I had been pushing somebody else," he said. "I had been pushing Nigo. My brother, always."
Nigo -- the founder of the brands A Bathing Ape and Human Made, the co-founder with Mr. Williams of Billionaire Boys Club and one of the most significant streetwear innovators -- had already been named artistic director of Kenzo, another LVMH brand.
Instead, Mr. Arnault extended the offer to Mr. Williams. "I had always wanted to work with him, in any way, shape or form since I started working in the group, which is already 10-plus years ago," Mr. Arnault said. "And it was just never the right time because either the companies were too small to work with someone as big as him, or there were already people in charge, or he was working with Chanel. And stars were so aligned now, finally."
Mr. Williams said, "I'm not calling it fortune -- I'm calling it favor."
Hiring Mr. Williams was one of the first decisions overseen by Pietro Beccari, a longtime LVMH executive, who was announced as chairman and chief executive of Louis Vuitton in January. "After Virgil, I couldn't choose a classical designer," Mr. Beccari said. "It was important that we found someone having a broader spectrum than being a very fantastic designer, which is great for the industry and we have many of them. But for that particular place, at Louis Vuitton, after Virgil, I thought we needed something more. Something that went beyond just pure design."
Mr. Williams signed the contract on Valentine's Day and soon relocated his wife and four children and much of his team. "Listen, I miss my house in Miami," he said. "And my house in Virginia. I really do. But right now, Paris is the center of the earth for me."
Playing the Game, or Not
His skin is as good as you think it is -- the additional pressure, or labor, or scrutiny of his new position has left no creases.
There was ease in his silhouette, too: a tight black double breasted vintage Vuitton blazer and well-worn white LV Trainer Snow Boots peeking out under bunched-up, flared dark bluejeans embroidered with faces derived from paintings by the Black artist Henry Taylor. The pants -- one of a few pieces Mr. Williams has deployed Taylor's work for -- will appear in the spring-summer 2024 collection, which will be shown in Paris on June 20.
He requested a tailor to come take a look at the hem of the jeans, which was a smidge too long on one side, and then sauntered over to the main conference table in the room, where he asked some colleagues to pull up images from his first ad campaign. It featured a pregnant Rihanna clutching multiple Louis Vuitton Speedy bags in primary colors, one of the first playful tweaks Mr. Williams is bringing to the company's heritage. The Speedy, one of Louis Vuitton's most recognizable designs, dates to 1930 and resembles a doctor's bag.
"I am a creative designer from the perspective of the consumer," he said. "I didn't go to Central Saint Martins. But I definitely went in the stores and purchased, and I know what I like."
He told Mr. Beccari something similar. "He said, 'I don't feel like a creative director here, I feel like a client,"' Mr. Beccari recalled, adding that he trusted Mr. Williams's natural instincts despite his never having managed a business of this scale. "I didn't even have to speak to him about the commercial importance of what he does and the importance in terms of turnover and volume of sales, but just the importance in terms of impact."
Mr. Williams looked at his Rihanna ads the way one might pose after a particularly athletic dunk. He pointed to one and said, "That's the golden ratio." For emphasis, he had an associate pull up the same image overlaid with the long golden spiral, the center of it landing directly on Rihanna's belly.
"What I love about this is, it's the biggest fashion house in the world, and that is a Black woman with child," Mr. Williams said.
Sarah Andelman, the founder of the pioneering Paris retailer Colette, and a collaborator of Mr. Williams's, said he makes creative choices "not just for the sake of doing things. There is a story and, I would say in French, profondeur, a meaning to what he will do."
Mr. Williams basked in the refracted shine from the screen full of Rihanna images.
"I know there's a game," he said. "I'm just not here to play it."
The Two-Decade Crash Course
Almost since the beginning of his career in music, Mr. Williams had found ways to incorporate, and create, fashion. In 2003, he founded Billionaire Boys Club with Nigo, perhaps his closest creative ally in style. Explaining the creative kinship between the two men, Nigo, through an interpreter, said, "The first time I went to Pharrell's house in Virginia, when I looked in the wardrobe, everything was the same as what I owned."
In 2003, Mr. Williams met Marc Jacobs, then the men's creative director of Vuitton, who invited him to collaborate on a pair of sunglasses. The result, known as the Millionaires, became a hip-hop luxury staple in the mid-2000s and an updated version of them is still sold today.
"He was just so incredibly generous to give me that opportunity when nobody had ever given any of us an opportunity to be creative," Mr. Williams said of Mr. Jacobs. (The Millionaires were designed by Mr. Williams, with Nigo.)
"I thought the way forward for Louis Vuitton was to collaborate with other creatives," Mr. Jacobs said. "It didn't matter to me whether they were from music or art or other fashion designers, whether it was Stephen Sprouse, Takashi Murakami or Pharrell."
Back then, when Mr. Williams arrived in Paris, Mr. Jacobs gave him vouchers to shop in the stores. "I was very nouveau riche at that time," Mr. Williams said, tilting his head down and offering just the tiniest hint of a knowing smirk. Mr. Williams also designed jewelry for Vuitton a few years later.
Other collaborations followed: Moncler, G-Star, Moynat, Reebok, a long partnership with Adidas and an almost decade-long affiliation with Chanel and Mr. Williams's close friend Karl Lagerfeld.
But none of those gigs had the complexity, or stakes, of his current assignment.
"Over the past several weeks he's had a crash course in design and how to run a studio and how to manage a team of 40, 50 people and how to take criticism and work with the people at the top because, you know, it's a blend of creativity and also running a business," said Matthew Henson, who has been a personal stylist for Mr. Williams for the last couple of years.
Mr. Henson is also styling the show, along with Cynthia Lu, Mr. Williams's former assistant who is now a quiet powerhouse of idiosyncratic streetwear with her brand Cactus Plant Flea Market.
When Mr. Williams walks through the studios, his awe for the specialized design teams appears genuine. "Presto, things get turned around so fast," he said. "I've had more resources than I've ever had in my entire life. They just don't miss. Like at all. None. Nobody."
That was something he was prepared for, in part, by conversations he had with Virgil Abloh, after Mr. Abloh was hired for this same job in 2018. In the three years at the helm of Vuitton's men's wear before his sudden death in late 2021, Mr. Abloh upended ideas about how a luxury house might function, and what story it might be able to tell in dialogue with those who had long been held at arm's length from luxury fashion. Just outside the atelier hangs the crucial, defining image from Mr. Abloh's first ad campaign for Louis Vuitton: a Black toddler draped in a "Wizard of Oz"-themed sweater, one of Mr. Abloh's first signature pieces.
Mr. Williams recalled Mr. Abloh's awe at the scale and efficiency of the atelier. "He would always talk about how they never say no, which they don't," he said. "So that's a responsibility not to abuse them."
Mr. Williams is now the second consecutive Black American in the role. "Over here, they lift us," he said. "They appreciate what we do. They see the talent that we have."
The Arnault family, he said, understands how crucial the Black American dollar and aesthetic has been to the growth and cachet of Louis Vuitton: "One hundred percent they know it," he said. "We've had some conversations about how important the community is to them, and how being supportive to them is a natural and a prerequisite."
He is looking to expand the house's brand ambassador program beyond the usual musicians and actors to Black academics, Black authors, a Black astrophysicist, even a Black bass fishing champion.
"They have to be supportive of the culture because the culture contributes to the bottom line," he said.
A New Humility
There are some things that Mr. Williams simply will not say. In public settings, at least, he speaks with the deliberateness of someone who wants no word to be misapprehended. His sunglasses stay on. ("I need something for myself," he said.) Rhetorically, he returns to familiar narratives and motifs -- the seismic changes in his life every 10 years, the eternal quest for learning, the continuing practice of gratitude.
"He never speaks the truth of himself, and I hate it," said Pusha T, who has known Mr. Williams for three decades. "It's my pet peeve about him. He knows he's great at things, but he wants that to walk him through the door versus him saying, 'Hey guys, come on. Let me through."'
Squint hard, though, and you may see the faintest flickers of the mid-2000s Pharrell Williams, a more boisterous and boasty person. A whiff of the old self popped out in a video Mr. Williams posted in late January, backstage at the Kenzo show with Nigo, when he knew he was on the verge of signing his contract. "You know what rhymes with 2023? Money money tree," he said into his phone camera, nodding intensely. He didn't lick his lips, but he might as well have.
When the appointment was announced, Tyler, the Creator, a longtime acolyte and style guru in his own right, FaceTimed Mr. Williams. "He just has this look he gives me where he kind of just goes like, 'Yeahhhh, I did that.' He didn't say anything," Tyler said. "And then he gave me the praying hands."
On his 2006 mixtape "In My Mind: The Prequel," a dizzying display of Dionysian ostentation, a peacock at the peak of his peacocking, Mr. Williams rapped, "We wanted this life, we salivated like wolves/ Blow a hundred grand on LV leather goods."
Mr. Williams almost flinched at the memory: "I was greeeeeasy on that."
Now, he said, "I promise you I really love being humble." But luxury fashion is not a business built on humility, and Mr. Williams is keen to make a splash.
The theme of his debut show, Mr. Williams said, will be "lovers." The first inklings of his vision emerged in April, at a Virginia festival that Mr. Williams organizes called Something in the Water, for which Vuitton made merch. It was received coolly.
Of potential negative criticism, Mr. Williams pleads equanimity. "I'm a student -- students learn," he said.
Mr. Henson said he didn't think Mr. Williams was expecting any "grace or favor" because of who he is. "He's expecting even more criticism and harsh critique," he said.
Mr. Williams shrugged. "It's not where my mind is, just because I think I err on the side of working with master artisans, and we're just literally working on the details," he said.
Staying Curious
An afternoon with Mr. Williams in creative director mode is a little bit like playing a first-person shooter. Requests pop in from unexpected directions, at erratic rhythms. Just when things get calm, someone emerges from around a corner with a mood board, or a vintage garment and a swatch of fabric it might be reimagined in. After being shown a hood with a novel but useful zipper, Mr. Williams nodded. "I don't want anything to be just for aesthetics," he said. "Everything has to have a real function."
For the second day in a row, he was wearing a Mickey Mouse T-shirt by Human Made, this time underneath a soft black leather biker jacket, and his flared jeans were in a Damier pattern.
A tailor brought out a mock-up of a double-breasted blazer for Mr. Williams to try on. One of the designers asked if he wanted "a very sartorial pocket" added to the design.
"Sartorial," Mr. Williams said. "Do you follow that guy on Instagram? The Sartorialist?"
For his first collection, he is leaning heavily on the checkerboard Damier print but reworking it in clever ways -- digital camo or, in Mr. Williams's parlance, "damouflage," and tweaking the colors away from the familiar browns and grays.
"Every season it's going to be a different colorway," he said, likening the playfulness to Takashi Murakami's neon monogram print during the Jacobs era. The soles of various shoes will be a modified Damier pattern. On a conference table were a pair of damoflage sweatsuits set aside for his parents ("My dad is a player," he said.)
Mr. Williams, who made waves in 2007 with his oversize purple crocodile Hermès Haut à courroies bag, is most tickled by the opportunity to innovate on the Speedy, which he is remaking in several primary colors, and also in an exaggerated, oversize silhouette. A yellow Speedy in meltingly soft leather sat on the pool table that serves as an impromptu work space in the atelier, almost slumping under its own very light weight.
"I want to give you that same experience that you get when you go to Canal Street, a place that has appropriated the house for decades, right?" Mr. Williams said. "Let's reverse it. Let's get inspired by the fact that they'll make some colorways that the house has never made. But then let's actually make it the finest of leather."
The day before, Mr. Williams had taken a moment to chat about designing a custom look for Naomi Campbell, including a zipped sports bra and zipped miniskirt, all in monogrammed leather ("'60s vibes, go-go"), and debating skirt lengths. "It'll work, but I don't know if it'll be as sexy," he said.
He also surveyed a pair of ship-shaped bag options, one steamer-like, one a bit shorter, and picked from various trim color and font options. "This seems to be the crispiest," he said, pointing to a white trim. He held one bag in each hand, then handed them to Nigo, who stomped off down the office in a mock model walk.
What Nigo did for Mr. Williams two decades ago, Mr. Williams is now doing for those who grew up admiring him.
"Me and him have a 20-year difference in age and man, what that does for me at my age is like, oh, it's still no ceilings," Tyler said. "To see someone at his age with his milestones, with his résumé, to not only still strive for a new world, stay curious, look for something new and something to challenge himself and let his creativity bleed into something else aside from just a drum pattern. And then actually get it. He not only strived for and did it, but actually nailed it -- it means so much to me."
Mr. Williams's new designs include printed leather jerseys and rugbys, quilted denim, Mao-neck blazers and ghillie camo with LV logo cutouts. He was excited to walk to the back of the studio, where the footwear designers work, and go over some eccentric ideas: Mary Janes and bowling shoes, a stone-encrusted snowboard boot, a design that initially scanned as a soccer sneaker but is actually a hard-bottom shoe. "I ain't even gonna lie," he said. "I was trying to do that at Adidas for years."
A little earlier, he was in front of his window, where he'd set up a small studio, and while fiddling with his Keystation 88 -- a keyboard and sound controller -- he asked his engineer to cue up a new song, tentatively called "Chains 'n Whips," that he was considering using as part of the show's soundtrack. Over a fusillade of psych-rock guitar flourishes, Pusha T rapped along to a pointed line in the chorus: "Beat the system with chains and whips!"
"That was made in this room," Mr. Williams said. "We just start walking around and looking out this window and you just see all of this. I mean, we beating this system, bro."

It's a New Broadcast World. Can the N.C.A.A. Take Advantage?: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Many college sports championships, including the marquee women's basketball tournament, have been sold as a bundle. The prospect of selling separately raises questions for dozens of sports.
For more than 20 years, fans of college sports like softball, baseball, women's basketball and more than two dozen others have known just where to find N.C.A.A. championships -- on ESPN's spectrum of channels.
The arrangement has worked well for both parties: The N.C.A.A. ensured that its top athletes would perform on a national stage, and ESPN added hundreds of hours of live programming to a college sports portfolio that is anchored by college football and men's basketball games.
A sign of how comfortable the N.C.A.A. and ESPN were with their partnership came in 2011, when they agreed to a 13-year, $ 500 million renewal without the N.C.A.A.'s ever taking the rights to market.
Now, though, with that deal set to expire in a year, it is increasingly likely that the next media rights deal for those 31 championships will look much different from the current one, which has been widely criticized as undervalued -- particularly for its marquee event, the Division I women's basketball tournament.
Addressing the upcoming negotiations, Charlie Baker, who took office as the new N.C.A.A. president in March, pointedly acknowledged last week at a symposium on college sports that "we dramatically underperform across a whole bunch of other revenue-raising opportunities."
The increase in interest in women's basketball has amplified pressure on the N.C.A.A. to sell those tournament rights by themselves rather than in a bundle with other championships. Doing so could fetch about $ 100 million annually, according to one analyst. Such an unbundling, though, could risk leaving other sports on lower-profile platforms.
And while the women's basketball tournament, coming off record-smashing attendance and television ratings, is heading to market at a seemingly opportune moment, the industry is in turmoil as broadcasters navigate a transition away from cable, which continues to bleed subscribers, and toward streaming platforms, which still have far smaller audiences.
There is much for the N.C.A.A. to consider. Have the interests changed at ESPN, whose parent company, Disney, is in the midst of slashing 7,000 jobs? What about at other networks, like CBS and NBC, which have fewer cable networks but do have fledgling streaming platforms? And might streaming-only companies like Apple, Amazon and YouTube, which have selectively begun to acquire sports rights, be players?
The N.C.A.A. declined to make Baker or any other official available for an interview, saying in a statement that it "is open to any and all new and creative ideas -- including potentially having stand-alone contracts -- to generate revenue to support student-athletes and continue to grow all sports, including women's basketball."
The N.C.A.A. has hired Endeavor, a global sports media company, to help develop its strategy for negotiations, which have not yet begun. Baker has said he expects a rights deal to be completed around the end of the year.
"The N.C.A.A. is a very political organization, and you're living in a different world of politics than you were 10, 15, 20 years ago when these deals got struck," said Chris Bevilacqua, a sports media analyst who previously advised the N.C.A.A. on media rights. "There are 500,000 N.C.A.A. student-athletes, and half are women, so there's going to be a lot of political pressure to architect something that is consistent with that narrative of investing in women's sports."
That pressure stems from a 2021 N.C.A.A. basketball gender equity review, which was commissioned after widespread disparities were identified between the N.C.A.A. men's and women's basketball tournaments during the pandemic.
In the report, Ed Desser, a sports media analyst, estimated then that if the rights to the women's tournament were sold on their own, they could have fetched between $ 81 million and $ 112 million for the 2025 tournament.
ESPN paid close to $ 50 million for the 31 championships this year, including the women's basketball title game, which drew a record 9.9 million viewers on ABC.
"The value has only increased" since his estimate two years ago, Desser said in an interview. He cited not only the increase in attention for the women's tournament, but increasing interest in professional women's basketball and soccer leagues.
Still, the surge in interest in women's sports has not necessarily translated to a boom in rights fees. In soccer, for example, FIFA's president, Gianni Infantino, threatened blackouts in several European countries of games from this summer's Women's World Cup before a deal was struck this week. Broadcasters were hesitant to meet FIFA's asking price for the games, which were being sold as stand-alone properties for the first time. Previously, they were bundled with the rights to the men's World Cup.
Women's basketball history over the last 30 years has been dotted with spikes and plateaus. The rise of Connecticut as a foil to Tennessee dovetailed into the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, where the United States romped to the gold medal, a dominant run that helped start the N.B.A.-backed W.N.B.A. a year later.
By 2012, interest in the college sport had stagnated to the point that the N.C.A.A. commissioned Val Ackerman, the first president of the W.N.B.A., to study how to bolster interest in the game.
During the pandemic, as many sports were shut down, the murder of George Floyd prompted a wave of social activism in the United States. The W.N.B.A. and women's college basketball leaned into that, and among other causes they questioned the many differences with the men's versions of their sports, including the inequitable weight rooms (and coronavirus tests) during the 2021 men's and women's N.C.A.A. tournaments. More recently, another cause arrived: the detention of the W.N.B.A. star Brittney Griner in Russia.
All this happened amid the loosening of N.C.A.A. rules prohibiting athletes from signing endorsement deals. That amplified the personalities of the top college women's players, who, unlike the men, are not allowed entry into the W.N.B.A. until they turn 22 (in their draft year) or graduate from college. In recent years, players like Sabrina Ionescu, Paige Bueckers, Aliyah Boston and Caitlin Clark became nationally known.
"We said it might take a generation" to gain a foothold, Ackerman said of the start of the W.N.B.A. "Now, the question for me is can this vibe be taken advantage of commercially? Will there be more tickets at higher prices? Will sponsors be paying higher rights fees? That's the test here. That's what's being put to market."
This is, however, a complicated time to go to market.
Even though cable subscriptions continue to plummet and nascent streaming platforms continue to build subscriber bases, there remain far more cable viewers than streaming viewers. (ESPN is in 72.5 million homes this month, according to Nielsen; ESPN+ has 25.3 million subscribers, a spokesman said.)
Such uncertainty is likely to shorten any N.C.A.A. deals.
Mike Aresco, the commissioner of the American Athletic Conference and a former CBS and ESPN executive, said media companies had generally preferred contracts of a decade or longer so they could focus on building up the telecasts instead of renegotiating the rights.
But lengthy deals have left the Pac-12 and Atlantic Coast conferences far behind the Big Ten, whose decision in 2017 to renew its media rights for just six years set it up for a seven-year, nearly $ 7 billion deal that begins this football season. It is also difficult to predict what the streaming and cable worlds will look like in five years, let alone 10.
"Everybody is rethinking how far out we'll go," Aresco said. "It's not an exact science. In fact, it's probably more art than science."
Even if the money ends up in the same place -- eventually wending its way back to colleges' coffers -- conference media rights deals are fundamentally different from what the N.C.A.A. will be selling. A conference agreement extends over the course of a season, while the N.C.A.A. is selling playoffs or championship events, which are condensed into a matter of days or weeks.
The women's basketball tournament also has another attractive selling point: It runs for three weeks in March and early April, a window in which most broadcasters are craving content. There is little else between the Super Bowl in mid-February and the Masters golf tournament and the start of the pro basketball and hockey playoffs in mid-April except the basketball tournaments. The rights for the men's tournament are owned by CBS and Turner.
"The women's basketball tournament is the top-rated event on ESPN between mid-February and mid-April," Desser said. "That matters, especially in a world where monthly subscriptions are increasingly in vogue. People didn't used to disconnect month to month, but now you have to have something that's competitive to stay in the decision set."
The upcoming negotiations will be different from those of a professional sports league, the increasingly professional nature of college sports notwithstanding.
The N.F.L., for example, might be expected to extract every last dollar from a deal. The N.C.A.A., even with Baker's insistence that the governing body must get better at increasing revenue, will have other considerations.
"It's a principle-based conversation," said Julie Roe Lach, the commissioner of the Horizon League and a member of the N.C.A.A. women's basketball oversight committee. "It can't just be monetary. It can't be as simple as which network is going to give the most money. There has to be a genuine commitment to grow the game."
In an era where athletes can make money from endorsements, she added, such growth might come in the way a broadcaster can help athletes reach a broader audience through mediums other than television.
Roe Lach is among those who believe that unbundling women's basketball would provide opportunities for other sports to grow on their own.
Perhaps the college baseball World Series might be attractive to the M.L.B. Network, or another network might get behind a niche sport the way the SEC Network has with its Friday night broadcasts of gymnastics that have heightened the sport's popularity in the South.
Julie Cromer, the athletic director at Ohio University and a co-chair of the committee that rewrote the N.C.A.A.'s constitution last year, believes Olympic sports are natural candidates to have their profiles elevated. She pointed to her time at Arkansas, where the university's indoor track and field team drew several thousand fans for its home meets, which prompted the university to livestream its events.
The N.C.A.A., she said, could act as an incubator.
"A lot of these sports have a dedicated fan base, and getting the product to that fan base doesn't always have to be accomplished through linear broadcasts," Cromer said.
One such sport would be lacrosse. Far down the sporting food chain, it has an anchor in the Northeast, but a decades-long push westward has been slow. When ESPN broadcast the men's and women's championships back to back on Memorial Day, it lent a big-time air to the event.
"Lacrosse has been searching for that for a long time," said Joe Spallina, the women's coach at Stony Brook University, whose regular-season game with top-ranked Syracuse was shown on ESPNU. "That's one of the problems with growing sports -- everyone wants to get to the top immediately."

'Dadfluencers,' or Fathers With Followings: [Style Desk]

Full text: Fueled by the pandemic and TikTok, a market for content made by fathers has staying power. Meet the "Dadfluencers."
Like many parents in the early months of the pandemic, Dave Ogleton was struggling. His business selling nutrition products was at a standstill. He and his wife, Jackie Megraw, were stuck at home in Devon, Pa., with their five (soon to be six) children, several of whom were languishing in Zoom classes.
To blow off steam, he started recording funny videos and memes about his family life and posting them on social media under the account @fitdadceo. People seemed to like them, so he posted more, with a recurring theme of "dad jokes." ("I said to my son, 'What do you call a group of crows that stick together?' He said, 'A flock.' I said, 'No, dummy. Vel-Crow."')
"Not taking myself seriously, especially in such a serious time, was freeing," Mr. Ogleton said. His audience began growing, so he posted every day. "It was very off the cuff, but I think other dads saw it and were like, 'Oh, yeah, we're doing that stuff too.' "
Today, Mr. Ogleton, who wears fitted T-shirts and a backward baseball cap in most of his videos, has 1.1 million followers on TikTok, along with partnership deals with Disney+, Netflix, Pampers and Procter & Gamble. He also sells merchandise printed with dad-joke phrases, like "It's not a dad bod. It's a father figure" and "I used to be cool."
"I'm a full-time content creator now, and it allows me to spend a lot more time with my kids," he said. "Just being around them gives me ideas. It's a double bonus."
Turning the camera on his family life also pushed Mr. Ogleton to pitch in more around the house (which, based on his videos, looks like a very normal suburban home cluttered with kids' stuff). He hadn't realized how much work needed to be done.
"Now I understand why my wife gets frustrated and run down sometimes," he said. "As dads, many of us have a lot to learn and do at home, but I think there's been a shift."
Mr. Ogleton is part of a growing number of dad influencers -- or "dadfluencers" -- who have amassed sizable followings in the past couple of years. "Fathers have been gradually playing a bigger role in the domestic lives of their families for a while, but I think the pandemic really supercharged it," said Cameron Ajdari, a founder of Currents Management in Los Angeles, which represents many dadfluencers. "It's created a big appetite for dad content, not just from brands, but also from parents and dads all around the world. Dad influencers are making other dads feel seen in a way that wasn't happening before."
The rise of dadfluencers has also been fueled by the booming popularity of TikTok. "With Instagram, a lot of men were uncomfortable with putting up these edited, staged pictures and captions," said James Nord, a founder of Fohr, an influencer marketing firm in New York City. "But TikTok has been a great entry point for a lot of dad influencers, because it comes across like you're documenting your life in a natural way, and you don't have to put yourself out there as much."
Advertisers are taking note. "Dad influencers are a kind of Trojan horse for brands," Mr. Nord said. "They are speaking to an audience that might not traditionally think of themselves as looking to other men on the internet for, say, fashion advice. But other dads are an easy entry point. And all of a sudden, here's someone people trust and relate to, talking about new pants that they love. People might not even realize that they're being influenced by this. They weren't coming to that person for style advice, but that's what they're getting."
Another reason that dads are curious to see how other dads parent is that they're in largely uncharted territory, compared with previous generations. In 2016, dads in the United States reported spending an average of eight hours a week on child care -- about triple the time that dads contributed in 1965, according to a Pew Research Center analysis.
Dads also said they spent about 10 hours a week on household chores in 2016, an increase from four hours in 1965. (Alas, while dads are doing more, a major gender gap persists: Mothers spent about 14 hours a week on child care and 18 hours a week on housework in 2016.)
The pandemic was brutal for parents in general (particularly moms, data shows), but dads were less likely to have the support systems that women are socialized to cultivate in times of hardship (also known as the "tend and befriend" response to stress).
"Traditionally, dads haven't really talked about parenting. My friends and I certainly didn't," said Thomas Piccirilli, a web developer and father of two in Monmouthshire, Wales, who posts under the Instagram account @the.dad.vibes, which has about 250,000 followers. "I think a big reason that what I was doing resonated was that I was honest and genuine about what I was experiencing."
When Kevin Laferriere and Evan Kyle Berger, comedians turned stay-at-home dads in Los Angeles, started posting skits about parenting to their shared account on TikTok, @thedumbdads, in 2021, they were also surprised by how much dads responded. "Our goal was mostly to have fun and to use it as a creative outlet," Mr. Laferriere said. "Then we heard from dads who said heartfelt things like, 'I'm the only stay-at-home dad I know, and your content helped me feel seen."'
Unlike some dadfluencers who lean into tired tropes of fatherhood -- dads are hapless morons who can't do anything, while moms are exasperated, overbearing multitaskers -- Mr. Laferriere and Mr. Berger are intentional about focusing on the universal fact that parenting is hard, regardless of who is doing it. "You're going to make mistakes. That's where the 'dumb dad' aspect comes in," Mr. Berger said. "But we're not about the weaponized incompetence that you see in a lot of dad content."
They both recalled a cleaning product commercial from their childhoods that depicted a mom coming home from work, clearly tired, to find her husband scaling a fish in the kitchen, proudly claiming that he had "dinner handled" as fish guts flew everywhere.
"Like, really? What picture are we painting of what a father is supposed to be? We don't do those types of jokes," Mr. Laferriere said. "We get enough material from being involved parents who make mistakes like everyone else. It's healthy for us to talk openly about this stuff. Screwing up, looking stupid. It's relatable."
Also relatable, albeit more fraught, is dads complaining.
"There's a lot of dads out there who are probably like, 'I'm supposed to be able to handle this without complaining or without needing support,"' said Mike Julianelle, a content marketing manager and father of two in Brooklyn who posts about parenting under the accounts @dadandburied and @gottoddlered. "But I'm very much pro-complaining, and I do it constantly, publicly, all the time."
He gets pushback for this. "I hear things like, 'If you're going to complain about your kids, you shouldn't have them.' But I think that's total nonsense. Everyone deserves to get things off their chest," he said. And finding solidarity is a nice perk. "I hear from dads, and moms too, telling me that I make them feel better."
Mr. Julianelle isn't the only one who has been surprised by the community that has grown out of his social media presence. Aaron Martin, a journalist turned stay-at-home dad in Miami, said that he never expected to make friends when he started posting Instagram videos of himself with his daughter under the account @stayathomedad. "But the more I started poking around when my daughter was napping or at night, I noticed a lot of other dads who were in similar positions, and ended up exchanging messages with some of them," he said.
Since then, he has connected with more of his dad followers, and they've even gotten together in person with their kids. "At first, I didn't know any other stay-at-home dads. And growing up in the late '80s and early '90s, I didn't really have any models for it, either. So it was isolating," he said. "The moms had their group texts, and I felt a little excluded at times." Now that he has built a network, he feels more confident as a parent, and he hopes to be an example for other dads too.
The world of dadfluencers is still relatively small, compared with many other influencer categories. But it includes a range of demographics. There are Christian dads (like Adam Busby, @adambuzz, with 1.3 million followers on Instagram), the "girl dad" (Joel Conder, a.k.a. @DadVGirls, with 1.4 million subscribers on YouTube), the "boy dad" (Devale Ellis, @iamdevale, with 2.1 million followers on Instagram), the gay dads (Jeffrey Romney Wright and Bryce Abplanalp of @growingupwithdads, with 21,000 followers on Instagram) and the cheerleader dad (Roland Pollard, of @rolandpollard, with seven million followers on TikTok). There are single dads, nonbinary dads, dads of children with special needs, dads with blended families and dads of quintuplets.
Of course, sharing your family life online comes with risks. Jonathan Joly, an influencer who started out on YouTube more than 14 years ago and now has 3.4 million followers on TikTok, weathered a backlash when he shared that one of his children is trans.
"When we learned our daughter was trans, we talked a lot about whether we could hide this from the world," he said. "But it would be really hard, and what does that tell our child?" Ultimately, he and his wife, Anna Saccone, decided to post about their daughter's transition.
"The things people call me, the things people say about me just because I've been supportive -- it's brutal," Mr. Joly said. But on the upside, he added, "so many parents say to me that I've opened their eyes to things that they wouldn't have known or accepted before."
In some ways, dadfluencers are reminiscent of the early mom bloggers of the aughts; they're speaking honestly about the trials of parenting in a public forum, and being met with a mix of judgment, eye rolling, empathy, curiosity and a kind of relief.
"I don't want to be like, 'Hi, I'm a dad and I'm so amazing. I get up at 5 o'clock in the morning and have a green juice,"' Mr. Joly said. "I stay up late every night, because it's the only time that I get to be on my own, and I need time on my own. I like content where it's about what other people do, but it shows the vulnerabilities of their parenting. And that's what I'm trying to do, too."

MIAMI — As top-tier presidential candidates go, Ron DeSantis is something of a rarity these days. He was born after the Vietnam War, he came of age when computers were common in American homes and he still has young children of his own, rather than enough grandchildren to fill a basketball team.
DeSantis would be 46 on Inauguration Day if elected, younger than every president since John F. Kennedy. It’s a fact he doesn’t state explicitly, but his campaign has set out to make sure voters get it.
The Florida governor talks frequently about having the “energy and discipline” needed for the White House, keeping a busy schedule of morning and evening events. He and his wife, Casey DeSantis, often speak about their young children, who are 6, 5 and 3 and have joined their parents on the campaign trail. One of the few candidates with kids still at home, DeSantis regularly highlights his parental worries about schools and popular culture as he presses his right-wing social agenda.
When he signed the state budget Thursday, he joked that a tax break on one of parenthood’s most staggering expenses — diapers — had come too late for his family, although not by much.
“I came home, and my wife’s like, ‘Why didn’t you do that in 2019 when our kids were still in diapers?’” DeSantis said.
The evident goal is to draw a stark contrast with his main rivals, President Joe Biden, 80, and former President Donald Trump, who just turned 77, both grandfathers who have sons (Hunter and Don Jr.) older than DeSantis. Voters have expressed concern about the age and fitness of both men, especially Biden.
Roughly two-thirds of registered voters believe Biden is too old to effectively serve another four-year term as president, according to a national poll conducted by Quinnipiac University last month. Only 36% of registered voters said the same of Trump, suggesting that DeSantis’ relative youth might be more of an advantage in a general election than in the primaries.
Still, DeSantis, 44, rarely talks directly about his age, and the party he represents — older and whiter than the country at large — has never been known for nominating young presidential candidates who ride a wave of energy to the White House, as Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama did.
His conservative views on abortion, climate change and how race is taught — among other issues — have left DeSantis out of step with many members of his own generation. Majorities of voters in his age bracket want abortion to be legal in all or most cases, think climate change is a very serious problem and support the Black Lives Matter movement. Only about 1 in 4 voters between the ages of 35 and 49 have a favorable view of DeSantis, according to the Quinnipiac poll.
DeSantis also hardly seems to have a natural knack for capturing youthful enthusiasm in the way that Obama did. The last major candidate to run on a platform of generational change, the 44th president was able to count on the support of young and influential cultural icons, including hip-hop artists.
Other than railing against “wokeness,” DeSantis scarcely mentions cultural influences like television shows, movies, music or social media. One of his attempts to reach younger people — announcing his campaign on Twitter with Elon Musk — went haywire when the livestream repeatedly glitched out. His rally soundtrack is a generic mix of country and classic rock, augmented by a DeSantis tribute anthem to the tune of “Sweet Home Alabama.” He doesn’t talk much about his love of golf or discuss his hobbies. His references to parenthood are often prompted by his wife.
But his children — Madison, Mason and Mamie — are highly visible. Neat stacks of toys, including baseball bats and a bucket of baseballs, are usually arrayed on the front porch of the governor’s mansion in Tallahassee, Florida, visitors say.
No presidential family has raised children as young as the DeSantis brood since the Kennedys, prompting hopes among supporters of a conservative Camelot at the White House. The comparison is one Casey DeSantis especially seems to be leaning into. The elegant gowns and white gloves she sometimes favors have seemed to evoke the wardrobe of Jacqueline Kennedy.
The couple’s family-centric image has softened views of Ron DeSantis among some Democrats in Florida. “I don’t like him as a politician,” Janie Jackson, 52, a Democratic voter from Miami who runs a housekeeping business, said in an interview this past week. “But I think he’s a good father and husband.”
Trump, who is twice divorced and has five children with three different women, could be particularly vulnerable to such comparisons.
“Engaging with his family helps humanize him,” Dave Carney, a New Hampshire-based Republican strategist, said of DeSantis. “He’s a dad. People can relate to that. It gives him credibility to talk about family issues.”
But voters can sniff out shtick, Carney added. “There’s a balance,” he said. “You don’t want your kids to seem like a prop.”
Younger Republicans do seem to be responding to DeSantis. A recent poll by The Economist and YouGov found that the governor received his highest level of support from Republicans and Republican leaners ages 18 to 29, although he was still trailing Trump 39% to 27% in that group.
At almost every stop on their swings through the early nominating states, Ron DeSantis and Casey DeSantis, who often joins her husband onstage to deliver her own remarks, mention their young family.
On a recent trip to Iowa, DeSantis and his wife, 42, arrived at the state fairgrounds with their children in tow. All three were wearing DeSantis-branded shirts with a “Top Gov” logo on the back. They signed a bus belonging to a pro-DeSantis super political action committee — his son did so while wearing a baseball glove — as Casey DeSantis, sporting a black leather “Where Woke Goes to Die” jacket despite the heat, knelt down to help. Their eldest, Madison, wrote her name in red and drew a heart above it.
“Did you guys write your stuff on there?” Ron DeSantis asked, after wading through attendees while lifting up one daughter. The kids then moved on to an ice cream giveaway organized by the super PAC.
“Want me to hold you?” DeSantis asked his son, Mason, before picking him up as the boy continued to eat ice cream.
On the stump, DeSantis usually talks about his children to emphasize policy points, particularly on education, or to accentuate his long-running feud with Disney, which he accuses of indoctrinating children.
“My wife and I just believe that kids should be able to go to school, watch cartoons, just be kids, without having some agenda shoved down their throats,” DeSantis said on a visit to New Hampshire. “So we take that very seriously, and we’ve done an awful lot to be able to support parents.”
DeSantis’ approach to family issues appeals specifically to conservative Republicans and has been criticized by Democrats and civil rights activists. He has signed legislation banning abortions after six weeks, outlawing gender-transition care for minors, imposing punishments on businesses that allow children to see performances like drag shows and further limiting instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in schools.
On the campaign trail, the DeSantises often try to temper the polarizing nature of his political persona with tales of family life.
Casey DeSantis usually coaxes her husband to open up about their kids, including his adventures taking them for fast food at a restaurant populated by inebriated college students and, in a sign of the couple’s religiosity, having them baptized with water from the Sea of Galilee in Israel.
At one stop in New Hampshire, Casey DeSantis apologized to the crowd for her raspy voice, suggesting she had strained her vocal cords in an effort to protect the furniture in the governor’s mansion from one of her daughters.
“I had a very long, in-depth conversation with that 3-year-old as to why she cannot color on the dining room table with permanent markers,” she said.
Now, Ron DeSantis has competition from another youthful, if far less known, candidate from his home state: Mayor Francis Suarez of Miami, 45, whose campaign announcement video this past week shows him jogging through the city and mentioning his children.
Another lesser-known rival, Vivek Ramaswamy, has promoted himself as the first millennial to run for president as a Republican. Ramaswamy, 37, also has young children, sons ages 11 months and 3 who have joined him on the trail. Campaigning with kids sometimes requires special accommodations, Ramaswamy said in a recent interview. His campaign bus, for instance, features two car seats and a diaper-changing table.
At the end of an event in New Hampshire this month, he turned away from the crowd to thank his older son, Karthik, for behaving so well during his speech.
“He got a bigger round of applause than I did,” Ramaswamy recounted.

Based on a True Snack Story. Kind Of.: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Richard Montañez, a janitor turned Frito-Lay executive, has said he invented the spicy snack. A new film tells his story, but the evidence isn't on his side.
It is almost certainly a fact that Richard Montañez did not invent Flamin' Hot Cheetos.
That revelation, which came to light as part of a 2021 Los Angeles Times investigation, arrived at a rather inconvenient time, considering a biopic based on Montañez's inspirational 2013 memoir, "A Boy, a Burrito, and a Cookie: From Janitor to Executive," in which he claims to have invented the spicy snack, was already in development.
But the Times article wasn't a death knell for the film -- in fact, far from it.
"We never set out to tell the history of the Cheeto," Eva Longoria, who is making her feature directorial debut with "Flamin' Hot," told The Los Angeles Times in March, shortly before the film's premiere at South by Southwest. "We are telling Richard Montañez's story and we're telling his truth."
So, the filmmakers forged ahead, and "Flamin' Hot," which bills itself as a "true story," will begin streaming on Disney+ and Hulu on Friday. The film follows Montañez (Jesse Garcia) through his early days as a janitor at a Frito-Lay plant in California, where he eventually makes a pivotal phone call to Roger Enrico (Tony Shalhoub), the chief executive of the Frito-Lay parent company PepsiCo, to pitch an idea for a tasty corn puff. That sets him on a path to becoming a multicultural marketing executive at PepsiCo.
Here's a guide to how the spicy Cheeto tale unraveled, what parts of it are actually true (there are some!) and what the real Montañez has said about the controversy.
Who is Richard Montañez?
Montañez began his career at Frito-Lay in 1976, when he was hired as a janitor at the company's plant in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif. He rose through the ranks, eventually becoming a marketing executive.
For around 15 years, he has claimed that he came up with the idea for Flamin' Hot Cheetos in the early 1990s after observing that Frito-Lay didn't have any products geared toward Latinos.
Did he invent Flamin' Hot Cheetos?
The Los Angeles Times investigation concluded that he did not, based on interviews with more than a dozen former Frito-Lay employees, company records and some glaring inconsistencies -- nay, impossibilities -- in his story.
For one, Montañez, who's now in his 60s, often recounts the story of how he cold-called the PepsiCo chief executive to pitch his idea after watching a motivational video Enrico had recorded as part of a campaign encouraging Frito-Lay employees to "act like owners."
There was just one problem, The Times found: Enrico didn't take over at the company until early 1991 -- almost six months after Flamin' Hot products were already available in a test market.
So that's a no, right?
Well, Montañez did invent something at Frito-Lay; it just wasn't Flamin' Hot Cheetos. According to a 1993 U.S. News & World Report article, Montañez pitched Flamin' Hot Popcorn, which debuted in March 1994 as an extension of the Flamin' Hot line.
Roberto Siewczynski, who in 1994 worked as an outside consultant on the test market for a new product line aimed at Latinos in Los Angeles -- Sabrositas -- also told The Times that Montañez was heavily involved in their development.
What has Frito-Lay said?
After a former employee, Lynne Greenfeld, contacted the company in 2018 to dispute Montañez's claim, Frito-Lay conducted an internal investigation, which found no evidence that Montañez played a role in Flamin' Hot Cheetos. Though, the company noted, the part of his story about him rising from a janitor to a marketing director was accurate.
A spokesperson for PepsiCo did pay tribute to Montañez's contributions in a second statement -- which did not challenge any of the facts of The Times's investigation -- saying that "his insights and ideas on how to better serve Hispanic consumers were invaluable and directly resulted in the success of Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
Who did invent Flamin' Hot Cheetos?
The company told The Los Angeles Times that its records indicated that the snack was developed by a group of scientists and marketing executives beginning in 1989 at Frito-Lay's headquarters in Plano, Texas. Greenfeld, then a junior employee, was tasked with developing the brand and, Frito-Lay said, came up with the Flamin' Hot name.
What has Montañez said?
He's sticking to his version of the story.
One of his arguments is that because he worked such a low-level job, there was a lack of documentation of his efforts. As for the inconsistencies in the timeline, he told Variety in 2021 that he was not aware of what might have been going on in other parts of the company.
"I'm not even going to try to dispute that lady, because I don't know," he told Variety, speaking of Greenfeld. "All I can tell you is what I did."
Does the film acknowledge the controversy?
No. An epilogue characterizes the film as a "true story," without mentioning the Los Angeles Times investigation or Frito-Lay's warnings to filmmakers in 2019 that it was unable to verify Montañez's involvement in Flamin' Hot Cheetos.
The film does mention that a group of Frito-Lay executives was simultaneously working on a spicy chip at a plant in the Midwest, though it doesn't pursue this plotline.
What Else Does the Film Get Right or Wrong?
Did Montañez deal drugs before joining Frito-Lay?
Yes. In his 2013 memoir, he chronicles his life as a gang member in East Los Angeles when he was young.
Did Montañez lie on his Frito-Lay application about having a high school diploma?
A voice-over in the film describes him as uneducated, and a tense scene shows him agonizing over the application. It's unclear whether Montañez, who dropped out of high school at some point before his sophomore year, fudged a credential he didn't have or just persuaded Frito-Lay to hire him without one.
Was Clarence Baker, the plant engineer whom Montañez befriends in the film, based on a real person?
Yes, according to a spokeswoman for Searchlight Pictures, the film's distributor. The character played by Dennis Haysbert was inspired by an employee at the plant where Montañez worked. The engineer died a few years ago, and his name was changed for the film.
Was Frito-Lay resistant to promoting Montañez?
While the company's opposition to his advancement is central to the plot of "Flamin' Hot," in real life, Montañez was promoted to a machinist operator within his first year, according to Frito-Lay records.
Was Frito-Lay going to pull Flamin' Hot Cheetos from shelves before a grass-roots marketing campaign spearheaded by Montañez?
No. In Montañez's most recent memoir, "Flamin' Hot: The Incredible True Story of One Man's Rise From Janitor to Top Executive," he recounts enlisting local women to hold Tupperware parties to help drum up interest in Flamin' Hot Cheetos, which, he writes, initially struggled to gain traction in a Southern California test market. According to what Siewczynski, the consultant, told The Los Angeles Times, that account is accurate -- if you're talking about Montañez's involvement with Sabrositas, not Cheetos.

So Many Ways to Tell His Stories: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: About two months ago, Eli Russell Linnetz moved into a house built in the mid-1980s by the actor Dennis Hopper. Mr. Linnetz had spent the last few years as a kind of Venice Beach Goldilocks, moving until he found a studio that felt just right.
For the 32-year-old multi-hyphenate -- we'll start with fashion designer, for simplicity's sake -- this was what finally felt right: a metal fortress with a roof curved to resemble the crest of a wave. Hard and looming on the outside, airy and exposed on the inside.
On a video call, Mr. Linnetz climbed a floating staircase beneath an impossibly high wood-beamed ceiling, pointing out original features like an angular glass bathtub and "the room where Dennis Hopper died." The scope was too much for our screens. Walking across the property, toward a small white house where he now lives, Mr. Linnetz discovered gardenias blooming in the yard.
One of his earliest renovation decisions was to tear up the studio's floors and install plywood from the time it was built. This choice was characteristically meticulous and nostalgic. Mr. Linnetz tends to fixate on small details in the service of telling a good story.
Before his first-ever runway show in May of last year, in which he introduced a collection made in collaboration with Dior, he explained: "I want the zipper, the buttons, the beads, the color to be in perfect harmony. You can have really expensive beautiful glass beads, but if they're not sewn on properly, they don't tell the story you want to tell."
If Mr. Linnetz sounds like one of those filmmakers bent on making sure every prop on their set is authentic and era-accurate, it's because he's also that. A director. And a screenwriter, a photographer, a stage designer and a music producer, who first began dabbling in the fashion industry in 2018. That dabble spiraled into a full-fledged brand, ERL, part of a family of brands supported by Comme des Garçons and its retail arm, Dover Street Market. Last year, ERL was named a winner of the prestigious Karl Lagerfeld Prize for young designers. The line is now carried in more than 220 stores.
For his next act, Mr. Linnetz will take one of fashion's most exclusive stages as guest designer of the Pitti Uomo men's wear fair. The title has been held by many of fashion's greats: Jean Paul Gaultier, Vivienne Westwood and Dries Van Noten in the 1990s; Virgil Abloh, Telfar Clemens and Grace Wales Bonner in more recent years. His runway show is scheduled for June 15 in Florence, Italy.
Yet Mr. Linnetz, to put it bluntly, would almost rather be working on his screenplay at home in Venice, Calif. "The show is interrupting my filmmaking," he said.
Once, on a visit to New York in 2021, I asked Mr. Linnetz what about fashion was exciting to him, considering his other occupations.
"It's literally not," he said that November. "I don't know how I ended up here."
As a child, he often sketched dresses, he conceded, and later made a prom dress for a friend, then helped pay for his tuition at the University of Southern California by sewing costumes for the opera program. But otherwise, Mr. Linnetz said, "I have almost no connection to fashion, other than it is the medium that's directly in front of me as a way to express the world around me."
That world is surfer chic with Americana influences: vintage-inspired graphic tees, swollen skate shoes, patchwork flared jeans, bright gradated knits, several variations on a hoodie.
"I almost feel like the Manchurian Candidate," he said. "Like someone calls me every morning to say, 'You will design today,' and my brain turns off, and I'm almost hypnotized."
A year and a half later, he still describes fashion the same way, as if it's a compulsion or illness beyond his control: "It's always with you. Can it just go away?"
But he says it with a grin.
Behind the Music
At first, Ronnie Cooke Newhouse, the influential creative director, didn't know what to make of Mr. Linnetz, when he asked for a meeting in Paris in 2016.
"You meet people from L.A. who are kind of out of the fashion system" -- and here she acknowledged a slight personal bias -- "and they all seem to do many, many, many different things. And, most of the time, many, many, many different things very badly. They're designers who don't design, they're actors who don't act, they're editors who don't edit."
So when she met the 20-something Mr. Linnetz, who said he had already directed a Kanye West video, produced music and worked for the playwright David Mamet, "I was just like, 'OK, here we go,"' Ms. Newhouse said.
Except, she learned, Mr. Linnetz had done those things, and a bit more, and not badly at all.
He was a child actor in Los Angeles -- with Disney credits including the 2000 animated film "The Emperor's New Groove" -- until his bar mitzvah, when he decided to quit acting to "focus on being Jewish," he said. At his temple, he met Mr. Mamet, who invited him to the set of his TV show "The Unit."
On the day of that visit, there happened to be a costume contest, Mr. Linnetz, then 15, recalled. He made Mr. Mamet a judge's robe from light-blocking fabric and a wig from cotton balls. "He was like, 'That's so odd, but come back tomorrow,"' Mr. Linnetz said.
When he wasn't in school, he was assisting Mr. Mamet, including on Broadway. One of his tasks was printing out emails sent to Mr. Mamet, who would write his replies on a typewriter.
At U.S.C., he majored in screenwriting, minored in opera and joined a fraternity. (He had always been interested in hypermasculine rituals; in high school, he wrestled.) He made a short film during his senior year starring Sawyer Spielberg, set in 1960s El Paso. But after graduation, the filmmaking didn't take off. He turned instead to 3-D animation. A friend who worked with Kanye West (now known as Ye) showed him Mr. Linnetz's art; Mr. Linnetz, who had met Ye a few years earlier, was brought in to work on cover-art concepts for "The Life of Pablo."
The relationship escalated. Among several other things, Mr. Linnetz can claim responsibility as "creative director of fabrication" for the 12 nude celebrity sculptures in Ye's "Famous" video -- the one with Taylor Swift, Anna Wintour, Bill Cosby and at least two U.S. presidents sleeping together in a colossal bed.
In 2017, when Kim Kardashian returned to Instagram after she was robbed in Paris, her first posts were Polaroids shot by Mr. Linnetz, who encouraged her not to look at the camera: "So much before the robbery was her looking to the camera -- the selfies. I was like, 'Let's do something where people are observing you so you're not asking anything from them, and they can make their own decisions about you."'
Working with the couple made him realize how art and photography could influence culture. But Mr. Linnetz also wanted to break out on his own. Opportunities arose to work with other performers, like Lady Gaga for the visual direction and stage design of her alien-robot-rock opera residency in Las Vegas.
By the time he asked Ms. Newhouse to meet, Mr. Linnetz wasn't pitching a specific project -- he simply wanted to work with her. She took a liking to him.
"He was adorable," Ms. Newhouse said of Mr. Linnetz, who can seem both impish and like an old soul in the span of one conversation. "I just felt he had something."
She asked him to direct an advertisement in 2017 for Comme des Garçons's Andy Warhol fragrance. The next year, he met the brand's president, Adrian Joffe. Just as his creative relationship with Ye grew quickly, so did this one. Mr. Linnetz was "kind of brilliant," with "a rare confidence," Mr. Joffe said in an email.
Almost as a dare -- "baiting him," Mr. Joffe said -- he asked Mr. Linnetz to make something for the opening of Dover Street Market Los Angeles. "He'd never made clothing before," Mr. Joffe said. The resulting pastel corduroy shirts ended up selling out in a week, he said. "He's just good."
Mr. Joffe offered Mr. Linnetz his own label under Dover Street Market Paris's brand development program.
At the time, Mr. Linnetz saw the opportunity as a way to escape the last few harried years of living adjacent to mega fame. (In the much-memed words of Lady Gaga: "no sleep, bus, club, another club, another club.")
"I created ERL to get away from all this music industry celebrity stuff," said Mr. Linnetz, who was looking for "something more meditative."
For ERL, which released its first full collection in 2020, he would shoot all the campaigns himself. He would work almost entirely by himself. He would live quietly; he doesn't drink or do drugs, he said, or enjoy going to parties or even leaving Venice, where he is happily isolated from the fashion world at large, with a newly adopted dog named Einstein.
He sees the irony in this thinking now: "It's weird to go and create something super-personal and then have everyone want to be a part of it."
California Couture
"Have you seen the movie 'Escape From L.A.'?" Mr. Linnetz asked in May of last year. He described a scene from the campy 1996 disaster film in which Kurt Russell and Peter Fonda surf on a tsunami wave while trying to chase down Steve Buscemi in a Cadillac.
The scene was his inspiration for the Dior ERL show set in Venice. The runway emerged from the beach with two large waves on either side, half-enclosing the audience, threatening to wash away all the fashion people.
"It's this moody, blue, grungy menace," Mr. Linnetz said, meant to spiritually complement the clothes, which were alternately electric and metallic in color, with loose silhouettes and shiny, swaggering accents. "It's a weird, twisted, colorful Californication of Dior. A lot of the logos say 'California Couture."'
Kim Jones, the artistic director of Dior Men, invited Mr. Linnetz to co-design the line out of a desire to support young talent. "We have a lot of collections a year," he said -- at least four -- and working with another designer can help "take you out of the bubble that you sometimes get stuck in."
He found Mr. Linnetz's initial approach to Dior's archives novel: The young designer decided to focus on the year 1990, when Gianfranco Ferré, then the artistic director, was leaning into opulence. Mr. Linnetz chose 1990 only because it was the year he was born.
"He reminded me of when I had my label when I was younger," Mr. Jones said. "I saw a lot of how I work in him -- very fast, decisive, clear."
His first solo runway show, for Pitti Uomo, will be more extravagant, Mr. Linnetz said. He will be introducing Eli Russell, a new line of tailoring and evening wear -- sweeping suits in rich textures, baggy and baroque, with even more shiny metallics, to be worn by surfer-models flown in to Florence from Southern California.
"The final result is somewhere between impractical and practical, comfortable and intolerable," Mr. Linnetz said. "This first iteration really feels like dress up. But some of the suits are, like, $ 15,000 to $ 20,000, so it's expensive dress up."
"I put a lot of importance on this one show because I don't know how many I'll ever do," he continued. He had no intention to do another after the Dior collaboration. And he feels torn, now, between thinking "this is kind of silly" -- just wanting to work on the third draft of that screenplay, an "exploration of American male friendship" about two friends starting college in the 1970s -- and perhaps going too big in Italy.
"If you do something bigger, you're suddenly confronted with the ridiculousness of everyone's desperate desire to go viral or have a crazy moment," said the man who once put Kid Cudi in a wedding dress and veil.
At the same time, while modeling a sequined top hat he made for the show, he expressed an intention to create a "barrage that leaves people utterly speechless." Mr. Linnetz can't help but contradict himself -- or maybe it's just that he contains multitudes. Is he the next "big star in the fashion world," as Mr. Jones predicted, or someone who only came to fashion accidentally, whose imagination and ambition to tell stories stretches far beyond the medium of clothing?
"Every 10 minutes, I'm like, 'Why did I do this?"' Mr. Linnetz said of his upcoming show. "Oh well, I guess someone has to do it."

Full text: Neither a drop of rain nor a cloud of wildfire smoke could keep more than 100,000 fans from flocking to the Governors Ball Music Festival over the weekend at Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens.
Waves of revelers, festooned in rose-colored tutus, elaborately designed fishnets and oversize cowboy hats, filed into the event held this past Friday, Saturday and Sunday. They thrashed to Odesza and Diplo; bounced to Lizzo and Kendrick Lamar; and swayed to Haim and Omar Apollo across three different stages in the green fields encircling the iconic Unisphere, the 140-foot-tall ball fit for ... a ball.
On the first day of the festival -- enveloped by a gray haze, either from the Canadian wildfire smoke, the pyrotechnics, the cigarettes or some combination of all three -- music lovers, in between vape hits and beer sips, discussed their outfit inspirations and favorite performances.
Juliet Kingsley, 22
Lives in: New York City
How long have you lived in the city? I've only lived here for eight months. I'm originally from Charlottesville, Va.
What made you decide to move here? I wanted to make video games, and I feel like New York is such a hub for media. I want to make games for change, like for example, ones that teach you about the environment, or just bloodshed. It depends.
Your outfit is giving more romance than bloodshed. Are you currently in love? I am, but he doesn't know that yet!
Katie Sidari, 22
Lives in: Westchester, N.Y.
Let me guess, is pink your favorite color? Yes, I've always loved pink since I was a child, so I always try to incorporate it into my outfit.
Demii Eubanks, 31
Lives in: Ridgewood, Queens
What was your idea behind the safety pins? I was going for more like a dark anime moment, but then I started going crazy with the safety pins and then it turned into this.
What kind of anime character? One with a skirt.
Cody McNeeley, 30
Lives in: Williamsburg, Brooklyn
Talk to me about your outfit. I decided I was going to do a skirt day, so I found this little denim one and this random cow shirt from Buffalo Exchange, and I said, "I could be a country bumpkin!" The boots I already had and the hat I stole from when I used to work for this little mouse in Florida.
By little mouse in Florida, do you mean Disney? Yes, and you can tell them I said that!
Stassia Smith, 28, and Gabriella Johnson, 26
Lives in: New York City and Las Vegas
How did you coordinate the outfits?
S.S.: So I had this Skims dress, and I taught her about Skims. And now look at her. What does she have on? Skims.
Was the matching blond hair intentional too?
S.S.: No, she copied off me with the blond.
G.J.: Yeah, no, as you can tell, I'm the fashion one!
Miss Zarah Misdemeanor, 37
Lives in: Denver
Who is Miss Zarah Misdeameanor? She is a lovable, kind, relatable drag entertainer. When I get on the stage, I'm here to provide joy for my queer brothers, sisters and siblings.
Walk me through your outfit today. I'm wearing a smiley-face shirt because I'm all about smiles and happiness, like that's what I represent. My boots and hat are from Akira, but I wish I didn't say that, because that's like my drag secret.
Is Akira another drag queen? She's not a drag entertainer; she's a full-on store in Chicago. So now I can never go back and perform.
Ayden Deanda-Rivera, 19
Lives in: San Francisco
Are you in the city only for Gov Ball? Yes, I just arrived yesterday. This is actually my first time in New York City.
What has surprised you the most about the festival? The crowd is definitely more straight than I imagined.
Kayla Weinstein, 22, and William Napoleone, 22
Lives in: Westchester County, N.Y., and Norwalk, Conn.
How did you guys coordinate your looks?
W.N.: Her idea, obviously.
K.W.: I literally told him wear something pink, and I will do the rest. Our outfits are on a budget, and we came out with this.
What do you love most about each other?
K.W.: I would say, you know, like his sense of humor. And like, his smile -- it's so infectious.
W.N.: She's adorable. I mean, just look at her.
Olivier Bois, 21
Lives in: Quebec, Canada
Tell me about your outfit today. Everything you see here is thrifted. I just got these overalls in New York for about $ 5 and this '70s shirt for like $ 5.
Did you do your own makeup? Of course, I'm an aesthetician.
What do you love about your job? I love doing people's makeup and making people feel better about themselves. One day I'm going to do Lizzo's makeup -- I'm putting that into the universe!
Jamilah Ray, 28
Lives in: Mount Vernon, N.Y.
Who are you most excited to see tonight? Lizzo because she embodies a plus-size woman like me, and I just love everything that she stands for.
What are you wearing today? I have a top that is made by one of my friends in Florida: Swami by Nadhi. I have on my mini shorts for Lizzo tonight, and I'm rocking some Adidas shoes.
Is that Michael Kors bag real? Oh yes, baby!

Fashion’s Reluctant It Boy

About two months ago, Eli Russell Linnetz moved into a house built in the mid-1980s by actor Dennis Hopper. Linnetz had spent the last few years as a kind of Venice Beach Goldilocks, moving until he found a studio that felt just right.
For the 32-year-old multi-hyphenate — we’ll start with fashion designer, for simplicity’s sake — this was what finally felt right: a metal fortress with a roof curved to resemble the crest of a wave. Hard and looming on the outside, airy and exposed on the inside.
On a video call, Linnetz climbed a floating staircase beneath an impossibly high wood-beamed ceiling, pointing out original features like an angular glass bathtub and “the room where Dennis Hopper died.” The scope was too much for our screens. Walking across the property, toward a small white house where he now lives, Linnetz discovered gardenias blooming in the yard.
One of his earliest renovation decisions was to tear up the studio’s floors and install plywood from the time it was built. This choice was characteristically meticulous and nostalgic. Linnetz tends to fixate on small details in the service of telling a good story.
Before his first runway show in May 2022, in which he introduced a collection made in collaboration with Dior, he explained: “I want the zipper, the buttons, the beads, the color to be in perfect harmony. You can have really expensive beautiful glass beads, but if they’re not sewn on properly, they don’t tell the story you want to tell.”
If Linnetz sounds like one of those filmmakers bent on making sure every prop on their set is authentic and era-accurate, it’s because he’s also that. A director. And a screenwriter, a photographer, a stage designer and a music producer, who first began dabbling in the fashion industry in 2018. That dabble spiraled into a full-fledged brand, ERL, part of a family of brands supported by Comme des Garçons and its retail arm, Dover Street Market. Last year, ERL was named a winner of the prestigious Karl Lagerfeld Prize for young designers. The line is now carried in more than 220 stores.
For his next act, Linnetz will take one of fashion’s most exclusive stages as guest designer of the Pitti Uomo menswear fair. The title has been held by many of fashion’s greats: Jean Paul Gaultier, Vivienne Westwood and Dries Van Noten in the 1990s; Virgil Abloh, Telfar Clemens and Grace Wales Bonner in more recent years. His runway show is scheduled for Thursday in Florence, Italy.
Yet Linnetz, to put it bluntly, would almost rather be working on his screenplay at home in Venice, California. “The show is interrupting my filmmaking,” he said.
Once, on a visit to New York in 2021, I asked Linnetz what about fashion was exciting to him, considering his other occupations.
“It’s literally not,” he said that November. “I don’t know how I ended up here.”
As a child, he often sketched dresses, he conceded, and later made a prom dress for a friend, then helped pay for his tuition at the University of Southern California by sewing costumes for the opera program. But otherwise, Linnetz said, “I have almost no connection to fashion, other than it is the medium that’s directly in front of me as a way to express the world around me.”
That world is surfer chic with Americana influences: vintage-inspired graphic tees, swollen skate shoes, patchwork flared jeans, bright gradated knits, several variations on a hoodie.
“I almost feel like the Manchurian Candidate,” he said. “Like someone calls me every morning to say, ‘You will design today,’ and my brain turns off, and I’m almost hypnotized.”
A year and a half later, he still describes fashion the same way, as if it’s a compulsion or illness beyond his control: “It’s always with you. Can it just go away?”
But he says it with a grin.
Behind the Music
At first, Ronnie Cooke Newhouse, an influential creative director, didn’t know what to make of Linnetz, when he asked for a meeting in Paris in 2016.
“You meet people from LA who are kind of out of the fashion system” — and here she acknowledged a slight personal bias — “and they all seem to do many, many, many different things. And, most of the time, many, many, many different things very badly. They’re designers who don’t design, they’re actors who don’t act, they’re editors who don’t edit.”
So when she met the 20-something Linnetz, who said he had already directed a Kanye West video, produced music and worked for playwright David Mamet, “I was just like, ‘OK, here we go,’” Newhouse said.
Except, she learned, Linnetz had done those things, and a bit more, and not badly at all.
He was a child actor in Los Angeles — with Disney credits including the 2000 animated film “The Emperor’s New Groove” — until his bar mitzvah, when he decided to quit acting to “focus on being Jewish,” he said. At his temple, he met Mamet, who invited him to the set of his TV show “The Unit.”
On the day of that visit, there happened to be a costume contest, Linnetz, then 15, recalled. He made Mamet a judge’s robe from light-blocking fabric and a wig from cotton balls. “He was like, ‘That’s so odd, but come back tomorrow,’” Linnetz said.
When he wasn’t in school, he was assisting Mamet, including on Broadway. One of his tasks was printing out emails sent to Mamet, who would write his replies on a typewriter.
At USC, he majored in screenwriting, minored in opera and joined a fraternity. (He had always been interested in hypermasculine rituals; in high school, he wrestled.) He made a short film during his senior year starring Sawyer Spielberg, set in 1960s El Paso. But after graduation, the filmmaking didn’t take off. He turned instead to 3D animation. A friend who worked with West (now known as Ye) showed him Linnetz’s art; Linnetz, who had met Ye a few years earlier, was brought in to work on cover art concepts for “The Life of Pablo.”
The relationship escalated. Among several other things, Linnetz can claim responsibility as “creative director of fabrication” for the 12 nude celebrity sculptures in Ye’s “Famous” video — the one with Taylor Swift, Anna Wintour, Bill Cosby and at least two U.S. presidents sleeping together in a colossal bed.

Working with the couple made him realize how art and photography could influence culture. But Linnetz also wanted to break out on his own.

Just as his creative relationship with Ye grew quickly, so did this one. Linnetz was “kind of brilliant,” with “a rare confidence,” Joffe said in an email.

Joffe offered Linnetz his own label under Dover Street Market Paris’ brand development program.

Re "Don't Kill 'Frankenstein' With Real Frankensteins at Large," by Maureen Dowd (column, May 28):
Ms. Dowd's column laments the decline of the humanities. Simultaneously, she definitively demonstrates that her exciting educational journey exquisitely prepares her, at a time when "political eloquence is scarce," to hurl the most pointed slings and arrows so as to hit scurrilous actors where they hurt most.
A wondrous part of her column focuses on rarely used words that have magnificently descriptive meanings.
Perhaps, however, the obituary for the humanities is premature. I suggest that Ms. Dowd be placed in charge of a committee to find a new word. The word will mean "a hunger and craving for works of art and literature that have been produced in their entirety by humans, unaided by artificial intelligence."
A thousand years from now, people will still relish going to a theater in which the actors are all human and performing works written by humans, even as down the block there are shows written, performed and produced by robots.
Joe Grossman

To the Editor:
Don't worry, Maureen Dowd. The humanities are something young people naturally find fascinating in the quest to define themselves, but can't justify spending time on because tuition costs require a direct return on investment.
Back in the heyday of the humanities when I went to college, a summer job was enough to finance a year of tuition. But also, a much smaller cross section of society went to college, often those who had money and influence to indulge themselves.
An emphasis on humanities scholarships, or free college tuition, as common in many countries, would help restore balance. But just as tech workers are rediscovering bread baking, sewing and woodworking, the humanities will be rediscovered by those seeking meaning and will rise again!
Nilgün Tuna

To the Editor:
Maureen Dowd makes a fair point, but some degree of perspective is in order.
In the 2020-21 school year, the most recent academic year for which complete data is available, U.S. colleges and universities awarded 35,762 bachelor's degrees in English, a number that exceeds the sum of all the bachelor's degrees awarded in the physical sciences and science technologies (such as chemistry, physics and geology).
Adding degrees awarded in foreign languages, literature, linguistics and those under the category "liberal arts and sciences, general studies and humanities" brings the total to just over 93,000. That's respectably close to the nearly 105,000 degrees awarded that year in computer and information sciences and support services.
It's also worth bearing in mind that students majoring in all subjects regularly take elective and distribution courses in English and the humanities.
Dennis G. Hall

The writer is the former vice provost for research and dean of the graduate school at Vanderbilt University.
To the Editor:
Among the many causes of the decline in interest in the humanities are the efforts to emphasize the importance of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. STEM programs have been very successful in creating educated talent for our technology industries. They needed to be successful to maintain U.S. competitiveness.
However, schools have limited resources, and the efforts to improve STEM courses draw resources and, most important, attention away from the humanities.
We need an equivalent effort to emphasize the humanities and their importance, which, for some, is harder to see than the importance of STEM. We need workers who understand philosophy and ethics to manage the many moral and legal ramifications of the technologies our STEM workers are creating.
We need English majors to help communicate just about everything. And we need history majors to become our diplomats and politicians to understand the past to better lead into the future.

'It Is Still Ongoing': How 'Parade' Takes On a History of Hate
To the Editor:
Re "Starring in 'Parade' Has Taught Me About Hate and Hope," by Micaela Diamond (Opinion guest essay, June 11):
It needs to be said that Ms. Diamond and the entire cast and crew of "Parade" deserve tremendous praise -- not only for tackling the emotionally difficult and draining subject of antisemitism for more than 100 shows, but also for the incredible service they've done in continuing to raise awareness of the story of Leo Frank, who was lynched by an antisemitic mob in Marietta, Ga., in 1915.
Before rapt audiences and through testimonials like hers and those of other actors, "Parade" has reintroduced the American public both to the travesty of the Frank case and to the sordid history of hate in this country, where antisemitism and racism often have run hand in hand.
At the close of "Parade," the words "It is still ongoing" flash briefly onstage. As testimony continues in the trial of the racist accused of gunning down 11 worshipers in a synagogue in Pittsburgh, and our televisions flash footage of white supremacists waving Nazi flags outside Disney World, there's no more urgent takeaway from this production. We haven't yet beaten back the demons that led to the tragedy of Leo Frank.
The lessons from his story are as urgent now as they were more than 100 years ago.
Jonathan A. Greenblatt
New York
The writer is the C.E.O. and national director of the Anti-Defamation League. The ADL was founded in 1913 during the climate of heightened antisemitism created by Leo Frank's arrest that year.
Body Donors
To the Editor:
Re "Honoring the Body Donors Who Are a Medical Student's 'First Patient"' (news article, June 4):
The rituals of honor held for people who have donated their bodies to medical education reflect the admiration, respect and thankfulness medical students have for such donors.
My decision to donate my body to medical education is motivated by a desire to extend my life beyond death, not in some ethereal afterlife, but in the reality of this life.
My chosen profession as an educator will not suddenly screech to a stop at death. Rather, I will continue to teach past my physical demise through the donation of my body to medical education.
I consider my future participation in the education of medical students a sacred privilege. I urge others, regardless of their professions, to seriously consider participating in the education of future doctors by donating their bodies for medical education and research.
What a great way to enter eternity!

Pay Workers Fairly
To the Editor:
Re "Loving a Job Doesn't Pay the Bills," by Simone Stolzoff (Opinion guest essay, June 6):
Everything Mr. Stolzoff wrote in this essay also reflects the book publishing industry in New York. My pay barely increased when I worked in-house for more than a decade.
In the 1990s I went to work for a prominent consumer advocacy organization outside the city where I had to join a union. It was the only time in my life that I felt adequately compensated for the work I did. I had to fill out a timesheet and was paid on an hourly basis.
They couldn't exploit my labor as the publishers had. As a result, I am completely pro-union.

Oklahoma Breaches the Wall Between Church and State: [Op-Ed]

Full text: If I had to sum up the current debate within the American right, I'd describe it as a contest between liberty and authority. To what extent should the political project of the conservative movement focus on the preservation of individual and institutional freedom versus expanding the power of the state to advance conservative ends? This was at the heart of my recent critique of Ron DeSantis when he officially entered the race for the Republican presidential nomination, and it's at the heart of my larger breach (along, of course, with profound concerns about character) with the Trumpist, nationalist right.
The dispute between liberty and authority has become a subtext of the Republican presidential primary contest. You can see it when Nikki Haley challenges DeSantis for using state resources to punish Disney for opposing Florida laws that restrict instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in public school classrooms. You can see it when Asa Hutchinson says, "It's not the role of government to punish a business when you disagree with what they're saying or a position that they take." Tim Scott has said much the same thing, agreeing that it's improper to weaponize government against private corporate expression.
You can see this dispute perhaps most starkly in the state-by-state conflicts over education. To what extent should the education culture wars be resolved by liberty or by authority? The liberty side of the argument seeks greater school choice, so that parents from all income backgrounds can enjoy the kinds of choices that wealthy parents take for granted. It also respects the free speech rights of students and the academic freedom of professors, so that the state doesn't become the final arbiter of truth.
The authority side, by contrast, believes that someone's worldview will control our schools, so it should be theirs. This is the impetus behind speech codes, which can dramatically inhibit free speech on campuses. This is the impetus behind the raft of anti-critical-race-theory laws and other educational gag orders, which attempt to tightly regulate instruction about race, gender and sexual orientation in public schools. This is one reason fights over library books are so contentious. The focus on regulating the ideas that students are exposed to is explicitly intended for the purpose of shaping their beliefs and ideology.
And that brings me to the mistaken decision of the Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board to approve "the nation's first religious charter school" this week -- a decision that split Oklahoma Republicans. The Republican governor, Kevin Stitt, praised the board, while the Republican attorney general, Gentner Drummond, said that board members "violated their oath in order to fund religious schools with our tax dollars."
Why the stark divide? The reason is simple: Despite widespread confusion about their status, charter schools are public schools, meaning that Oklahoma has created and sanctioned a Catholic public school in the state. It has clothed a Christian institution with state authority.
To understand the conceptual and constitutional problems with this decision, it's necessary to understand a bit more about charter schools. While they tend to operate separately from local public school districts (and often have private management), they're creations of state law, highly regulated and publicly funded. The Oklahoma City Public Schools website, for example, describes charter schools as "innovative, nonsectarian public schools" that are "open to all children" and "do not charge tuition."
Last fall, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled that a North Carolina charter school called the Charter Day School was a state actor and thus subject to constitutional restrictions on the school's authority. Specifically, the school's dress code -- which required girls to wear skirts, jumpers or skorts as part of an effort to "preserve chivalry and respect among young women and men" -- violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.
The ruling doesn't bind Oklahoma (which is part of the 10th Circuit), but it's still the leading case on the subject, and it's currently on appeal to the Supreme Court. We don't yet know if the Supreme Court will act, but the very idea that a religious institution should be either clothed with state authority or subject to state control -- let alone both -- is antithetical to the constitutional balance struck by the First Amendment's establishment clause and free exercise clause.
At their philosophical core, the two clauses work together to pre-empt the kinds of religious conflicts that have ripped apart so many nations and cultures. The establishment clause declares that no church can control the state (nor can the state control the church), thus lowering the stakes of political conflict so that politicians have minimal influence over religious doctrine.
In exchange, the free exercise and free speech clauses guarantee that religious organizations enjoy extraordinary freedom and autonomy. Decades of Supreme Court precedent have now established that states can't discriminate against religious individuals or institutions in the provision of state benefits, can't target religious expression for state punishment and, critically, can't regulate the hiring or firing of ministerial employees.
This conflict between liberty and power isn't confined to the right, however. The left faces its own divisions, particularly on college campuses. In April, I wrote about how multiple mainstream academic institutions are pushing back against censorship demands that often come from the left. And last month, a conservative legal group filed a lawsuit challenging a raw exercise of power from the University of California system, namely the inclusion of mandatory diversity, equity and inclusion (D.E.I.) statements from candidates applying for jobs in the state system.
These D.E.I. statements are not meaningless formalities. Indeed, powerful evidence suggests that they're used as ideological litmus tests for new faculty hires. As my colleague Pamela Paul pointed out in a recent column, "At the University of California, Berkeley, for example, in the hiring cycle from 2018 to 2019, three-quarters of applicants for a set of five faculty positions in the life sciences were eliminated on the basis of these statements alone."
In other words, it's not just the religious right that is conflicted on the question of freedom versus authority. It's not just conservatives who seek to restrict American debate by limiting the viewpoints to which students are exposed.
If you subscribe to this newsletter, you might note that I sometimes swing back and forth between critiquing left and right, noting how similar maladies afflict both movements. In fact, it's remarkably common to find mirror-image excesses and abuses on both sides. I've also previously discussed the concept of horseshoe theory, the idea that as right and left become more extreme, they become more alike.
And so it is in the educational culture wars. Extremes on each side are so preoccupied with gaining the advantage in teaching the next generation that they forget that a core purpose of American schooling is to prepare students, in the words of Justice William Brennan, "for active and effective participation in the pluralistic, often contentious society in which they will soon be adult members."
Both religious liberty and religious disestablishment are vital elements of American pluralism. Oklahoma shouldn't discriminate against religious expression, but it must not create state religious schools. Clothing any church institution with state power is bad for the church and bad for the state. Oklahoma conservatives can and should advance their values through the exercise of liberty, not by breaching the barrier between church and state.

Movies to Stun and Amuse on Hulu: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: The Disney-owned Hulu streaming service is a repository for many new TV shows. But savvy viewers can also find a rotating library of movies, both recent releases and classics, rivaling the collections of many of its competitors -- if they know where to look. We're here to help.
'I Am Not Your Negro' (2017)
This stunning documentary concerns the life and writings of James Baldwin, but it's less focused on tracing the arc of its subject's life than on the potency of his words. The director Raoul Peck uses as his framework the notes of Baldwin's unfinished book, "Remember This House," in which Baldwin was attempting to reckon with the legacies of Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and Medgar Evers; guided by Baldwin's passages, Peck constructs an urgent and audacious essay about our past and our present. Our critic called it "a concise, roughly 90-minute movie with the scope and impact of a 10-hour mini-series."
'The Square' (2017)
The Swedish director Ruben Ostlund followed up his pointed social satire "Force Majeure" with this arch, uproarious and bitter attack on the pretensions of the art world. He adds a few famous faces to the mix (including Elisabeth Moss and Dominic West), but his biting voice is not tempered -- if anything, the blatant discomfort and inescapable embarrassment are cracked up. That doesn't sound like much fun, granted, and at times, it is not. Yet Ostlund's refusal to soften (or redeem) his characters is admirable, and if you have the right kind of darkly comic sensibility, it's a deeply funny piece of work.
'Sophie's Choice' (1982)
Meryl Streep won her second Oscar for this elegiac adaptation of the William Styron novel of the same name, directed by Alan J. Pakula ("All the President's Men"). What begins as a folksy story of a would-be writer and his friendship with the couple upstairs grows into something far more traumatic, as the naïve, young Stingo (Peter MacNicol) discovers exactly what led Sophie (Streep), a Polish immigrant, to lose her two children before immigrating to the United States. Our critic wrote, "It's a film that casts a powerful, uninterrupted spell."
'Man On Wire' (2008)
James Marsh's Academy Award winner for best documentary tells the exhilarating story of the French daredevil Philippe Petit, whose team of friends and accomplices sneaked into the World Trade Center one night in 1974 to run a high-wire between the twin towers, so that Petit could dazzle downtown New York with an early-morning tightrope walk. Marsh ingeniously meshes archival footage and contemporary interviews with stylish re-enactments, framing Petit's daring feat as a heist movie where the payoff is the possibility of death. It's a thrilling and fascinating film, and a quiet valentine to the vanished skyscrapers.
'Boogie Nights' (1997)
When this crime-infused comedic drama roared onto the indie scene in the fall of 1997, it was widely (and favorably) compared to "Pulp Fiction." It's not hard to guess why: the setting amid the seedy underbelly of the Los Angeles suburbs; the screenplay filled with sly cinematic allusions; the hotshot young auteur, directing his second feature. But Paul Thomas Anderson was no Quentin Tarantino wannabe. "Boogie Nights," Anderson's breakthrough film, is most memorable for the affection it shows its characters -- a crew of pornographers and outcasts -- and for its humanistic approach to their eccentricities. (If you love epic dramas, try "Once Upon a Time in America.")
'Bridesmaids' (2011)
Kristen Wiig stars in and co-wrote (with her frequent collaborator Annie Mumolo) this "unexpectedly funny" comedy smash from the director Paul Feig. Wiig is Annie, an aimless baker whose lifelong pal, Lillian (Maya Rudolph), is getting hitched. When Lillian asks Annie to serve as maid of honor, an uproarious series of broad comic set pieces and thoughtful introspection are set off. The comedy and drama are played to the hilt by an ensemble that includes Rose Byrne, Jon Hamm, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Ellie Kemper, Chris O'Dowd and Melissa McCarthy, who earned an Oscar nomination for her role. (The following year's "Bachelorette" explores similar themes with a darker edge.)

Full text: Taking shelter in the Strand, an encounter with a very tall man and more reader tales of New York City in this week's Metropolitan Diary.
Absurdity
Dear Diary:
My wife and I were walking back to our West Village apartment on a cold, rainy winter evening after an early dinner of Indian food in the East Village.
As we approached Broadway and West 12th Street, it started raining harder. I glanced up at the sign above the entrance to the Strand bookstore.
"Let's go in until the rain passes," I suggested.
"That could be a while," my wife said.
"That's OK," I said.
We walked inside, shaking the rain off like wet dogs.
"There's a collection of stories I want to find," I said. "I think it's called 'Russia's Lost Literature of the Absurd' or something like that."
I heard a voice coming from behind a nearby stack of books. I couldn't tell if it belonged to an employee or someone else.
"It's not lost," the voice said. "It's right there, in the 'Absurd' section."
"Oh, thank you," I stammered. "Where's that?"
"Wouldn't you like to know?"
-- Doug Sylver
Very Tall Man
Dear Diary:
My sister and I used to walk everywhere in the city, traveling from Brooklyn Heights to the top of Central Park.
On one of our trips, we became incredibly tired, so we found a bench to rest on. A very tall man was sitting next to us eating a hot dog. He had three of them and offered us the other two.
We politely declined. It was 1973. I was 15, and my sister was 10.
The very tall man asked us about our lives, and we told him about ourselves.
As we said goodbye, my body began to tingle. I realized that the very tall man was Dave DeBusschere of the New York Knicks, my favorite sports team.
Walking back across the Brooklyn Bridge later, I thought about how cool it was that one of my idols could be an ordinary person like me, eating hot dogs on a New York bench.
-- Jennifer Wallick
To Karine
Dear Diary:
To Karine, the early riser,
Breakfast maker, stabilizer,
Medical communicator,
Piloting the elevator,
On and off a city bus,
Paying for the both of us,
Making sure I get a seat,
And stand upright on my feet
In the park the local creatures,
Wait for handouts -- double features,
Peanuts, fluffy bits of bread galore,
Picked up from the asphalt floor,
Here they come, just as we said:
Robins, finches, sparrows, starlings,
Cardinals, blue jays are the darlings,
Squirrels sighting peanuts beckoning,
Seize the prize, ignore the reckoning,
On and off and in between,
Here they come to greet Karine
Nosing to a double nut
Friendly to their habitat
Underground and in their nest,
Squirrels hide the very best,
Of their harvest for the winter,
When there's only ice to splinter,
And the squirrels stay indoors,
On their cozy upper floors,
As the snow gets deep and deeper,
Every squirrel is a sleeper.
Only ducks can navigate,
Polar ice on which we skate,
Gloveless, shoeless, unlike us,
They're afloat and make no fuss,
Upper-body: warm as toast,
Thanks to down-coat coast-to-coast!
Still they come ashore to flirt,
And collect a sweet dessert!
Mr. Drake and Mrs. Duck,
Faithful partners, full of luck
When their relatives, the geese,
Come in squadrons, land with ease,
Nibbling shoots of precious lawn,
All my friendliness is gone
Let them fly to Nova Scotia,
Manitoba or Kenosha,
Not to kill with acid spill,
Our parkland, dale and hill
So Karine and I can walk,
Through the seasons of New York
Anyway, that is a promise,
Merry Christmas, Mister Thomas
-- Thomas F. Naegele
Best Seat
Dear Diary:
There's a tavern on the corner across from my apartment building that I've been visiting for lunch on a more-or-less weekly basis for some time.
The staff there is friendly, the place has tasty bar food and there is an inviting outdoor seating area where one can watch the passing parade.
But the benches at the outdoor tables are uncomfortable for this old-timer, so whenever I visited I would bring a souvenir stadium cushion that I got at one of my alma mater's bowl games.
On one particularly cold day, I didn't bring the cushion because I had decided to eat inside. As I was escorted to my table, I heard one of the waitresses yell out from across the room.
"Go Rutgers!"
-- Walter Staab
Cinderella Story
Dear Diary:
I was waiting to cross the street on a chilly night in Brooklyn when I found myself standing next to a woman who was clutching a bottle of wine to her chest, swaying back and forth and singing the theme from Disney's "Cinderella."
Noticing her companion's apparent indifference to what she was doing, I joined in loudly, singing along with her until the light turned green.
As I crossed the street, I heard her turn to her companion and say: "See? That's what I miss about New York City!"

Quiet. Jim Gaffigan Might Be Napping.: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: The stand-up comedian, who plays Mr. Smee in "Peter Pan & Wendy," gets material from his kids and finds common ground in writing and gardening.
Few stories capture the anxiety of aging out of childhood like Peter Pan. Jim Gaffigan, who wore a white beard to play Mr. Smee, the long-suffering associate of Jude Law's Captain Hook in the new film "Peter Pan & Wendy," finds the story to be much more important for adults than kids. Even one, like him, who makes his living talking to strangers about how much he enjoys eating at McDonald's.
"Wendy not wanting to grow up -- I understand that, and I'm very close with people that really identify with the whole Peter Pan complex," the stand-up comedian said in a phone interview earlier this month. "Most comedians don't want to grow up."
"Peter Pan & Wendy," directed by David Lowery, hits Disney+ on April 28. Gaffigan, who lives in New York with his wife -- the writer and producer Jeannie Gaffigan -- and their five children, talked about the material he gets from his offspring, how he keeps them away from his pizza and why gardening feels like writing. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Writing
It's very important for me to have consistent access to a feeling of creative fulfillment. As a stand-up comedian, it can be coming up with a new line or a whole new topic. Or it can be writing a CBS "Sunday Morning" commentary. It's nice if it's embraced, but you did it for yourself. That creative fulfillment is something I can't imagine my life without. It is so much more important than accolades or monetary gain.
Gardening
In a strange way, gardening is similar to writing and acting in that every day you know what the task is, but the outcome can be different. So, you might know that you'll be able to grow some cucumbers, but what you do to facilitate that or to help it can be different every day. You have some control, but not all control. The trial and error of gardening and the meditative time you spend doing it is really calming, and it reminds me of writing stand-up and building a character for a movie.
Naps
Napping is not that rare among comedians because of the necessity to peak at a certain time. In my late 20s and early 30s, I was getting up early to audition for commercials, then I would have stand-up shows at night, and I felt a lot of guilt about napping. I remember hearing about Ronald Reagan napping, and it was presented as not a thing of weakness, but almost like a retirement thing. I've evolved to appreciate the value of it. It's a nice way of saying: I quit for this part of the day.
My Kids
The amount of material that my five children have provided me is not the reason I have five kids, but I know that the crisis of each one of their lives -- and I say that with affection, because I care -- is going to provide insights, lessons and, hopefully, material.
Deep-Dish Pizza
I have a long-distance love affair with Chicago deep-dish pizza. It's got to be the sausage deep-dish. They're all good, but Lou Malnati's delivers and we've done that many times. What's confusing about Chicago deep-dish pizza is that there's way too much of it. No one needs to ever eat more than a piece, but you end up eating more than a piece. And I'm ridiculously selfish with it. I will make sure there's other pizza that will be given to my children so that I can eat the deep-dish, because I'm not going to waste that on a kid.
Blue Pens
I like the Staples OptiFlow pen. What's amazing about this pen is that they work great, then they eventually explode in your hand. I use it for editing. I don't know how people can write with a black pen. If you've printed out something and you put black notes on, you're going to miss those. It has to be in blue.
Saint Agur Blue Cheese
Before we had kids, my wife and I would get a bottle of red wine and, because we thought we were fancy, we would try different cheeses, like Saint Agur Blue. It's an amazing, creamy blue cheese that has stayed with me.
Malcolm Gladwell
Right now I'm reading "Talking to Strangers." I like that, in all his books, he presents information, presents a theory, but there isn't one conclusion to it. And there is an efficiency to getting to the facts. He doesn't do a long preamble. I'm not a podcast guy, but I think his books provide me with the intellectual stimulation that a lot of people get from podcasts.
Steakhouses
After a show, I'll often reward myself by going to a steakhouse. I've been to a lot of different places -- The Palm, Ruth's Chris, Elway's in Denver. I like the fact that there's some formality at a steakhouse, but it's not over-the-top. It's as nice as I want things. It's dark, you have your privacy, you can have a good conversation. I just love the whole vibe of a steakhouse.
Fear
People ask if I get nervous before I go onstage. I wouldn't say I'm nervous, but if there wasn't a dose of fear, there wouldn't be the reward. I value the fear of performing. I think it's exciting. There's always the possibility that, for a comedian, people won't laugh, or, if you're part of an acting project, that people will say it's the worst thing ever. But it's that kind of fear and risk that is exciting.

Casey DeSantis Is Your Obsession. Jill Biden's Mine.: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: From the breathless media coverage of Ron DeSantis's recent visits to Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, you could easily get the impression that:
Voting starts in approximately five minutes.
You're really watching a new Netflix series about a body snatcher's attempts to pantomime just enough humanity to amass power on Planet Earth.
The Florida governor's entire candidacy hinges on his wife, Casey DeSantis.
She could be RuPaul at a drag ball for all the attention she's getting. She could be the sorcerer in Disney's "Fantasia" for all the magic journalists are primed for: When she's with her grumpy guv, will her sunshine melt his ice? Can her aptitude for small talk make up for his allergy to it? And when she trots out the couple's three children, ages 3 to 6, will voters be reminded of and charmed by her husband's youth? (He's 44 to Donald Trump's 76.)
Those are the wrong questions about Casey DeSantis. And they reflect how wrongly we in the media often approach the subject of political spouses in general.
We wildly overestimate their potential impact on a politician's image. I've spoken to many, many voters over the years, and I've emerged from exactly zero of those conversations thinking: "Wow, Barack is going to owe Michelle for a few hundred of this state's votes." Or: "Tipper just swung that state out of Al's win column."
Back when Bill Clinton was running for the White House, some pundits cast Hillary Clinton as a poison pill with voters in the middle. Last I checked, he won two presidential elections in a row.
And I challenge you to find me one voter, just one, whose pro or con decision about Trump hinged on his third wife. Where, by the way, is she? And how, pray tell, did she assist his 2016 victory? I'd forgotten all about her until she came up the other day in a Daily Beast headline that called Casey DeSantis "the Walmart Melania." Better than "the Bergdorf Melania," which would be redundant. It would also summon thoughts of a certain dressing room and would disregard Republicans' populist conversion. They're now all about the little guy and gal! Well, except when they're doling out tax cuts.
But while we tend to exaggerate the importance of what a spouse does in public, we sometimes shortchange the relevance of what a spouse does in private. That's where and how Casey DeSantis probably matters most.
By many accounts, including an especially thorough profile of her by Michael Kruse in Politico recently, she's "uncommonly involved" (Kruse's words) in all aspects of her husband's career: strategy, policy, the friends-and-enemies scorecard. He doesn't simply turn to her in a dutiful, chivalrous, "And what do you think, honey?" fashion. She's no afterthought. She's the first thought. And the second thought. And the very last thought.
The political spouse I observed most closely, Laura Bush, was much more consequential behind the scenes than in front of the cameras. She in fact recoiled from the spotlight. But George W.'s aides relished her presence on the campaign trail with him because she calmed him, grounded him, took the bluster out of him whenever he was getting blustery.
She read the news coverage about him so that he didn't have to, and she would tell him what he needed to know but not what would make him fume pointlessly at us journalists in the back of the plane. That was her impact -- not the way she dressed, not how she styled her hair, not the degree of verve or humor with which she delivered public remarks when she consented to do that. She regulated his emotional temperature.
I get the impression that Jill Biden does likewise with Joe, to an extent that could be absolutely critical to what happens in November 2024.
That Jill gets a say and gets her way was clear in a priceless anecdote that she included in her 2019 memoir, "Where the Light Enters." She recalled being by the pool and hearing her husband's political advisers, who were inside with him, trying to persuade him to enter the 2004 presidential race. She and Joe had ruled that out.
"A Sharpie caught my eye," she wrote. "I drew NO on my stomach in big letters, and marched through the room in my bikini."
President Biden is 80. It's not ageist to observe that over the months between now and Election Day, he must pace himself carefully, watch his health closely, do all he can to decrease the odds of any stammer or stumble that will be turned against him. He must stay focused and optimistic, which means tuning out as much of the Hunter Biden melodrama as he can. Rest is vital. Mood is pivotal.
And no one -- not Ron Klain, not Mike Donilon, not Anita Dunn -- can help with that the way Jill can. So, you go ahead and put Walmart Melania under a microscope. I'll be over here putting White House Jill on a pedestal.

Words Worth Sidelining: Canine Edition
My computers' operating systems demand to be updated yearly, it seems. Several of my apps cry out for renewal every few months. So how is it that archaic sayings hang around for not just decades but centuries past the point of any coherence?
I direct you to the doggedness of phrases that invoke dogs. I can't square them with the ways of my dog, Regan, and of most of the other American pooches I know.
It's still said that someone "works like a dog." How many of the dogs around you do arduous physical labor -- do any physical labor -- or keep even a 9-to-5 schedule of other tasks? Barking at the Amazon delivery person doesn't count.
A hypochondriacal friend of mine always announces: "I'm sick as a dog!" In my experience, dogs are significantly hardier than we humans. No cold compresses, no hot tea, no Purell, no Pepto Bismol.
"A dog's life" means a harsh one, never mind the Instagram parade of golden retrievers in platinum digs, French bulldogs in haute couture and Siberian huskies that will never come within a snowball's toss of a sled (or of Siberia).
And those furry social-media stars nosh on treats, not one another. So the phrase "dog-eat-dog world" baffles me. They're dachshunds, not the Donner party.
Also, I detect, at least in English, some semantic inequality between dogs and cats, with the former starring in more negative metaphors ("lie down with dogs, get up with fleas," "call off the dogs") than the latter do.
To wit: Donald Trump so frequently took a canine tack with his insults that Philip Rucker wrote an entire article in The Washington Post about how, in Trump's "singular lexicon, there is no more vicious put-down than likening an adversary to a dog." "Choked like a dog," "fired like a dog," "sweat like a dog" -- Trump had used all of those and more.
Cats got off easy. Don't they always? If someone calls you "the cat's meow," "the cat's pajamas" or a "cool cat," you have cause to purr. A "fat cat" indulging in a "cat nap" has anything but "a dog's life."
That said, I cringe at hearing that someone "let the cat out of the bag." What sadist almost suffocated the kitty in the first place?
Let's retire that phrase, along with the digs about dogs above. While we're at it, let's rethink "kill two birds with one stone." I'd rather let the feathered creatures live. And I'm not much for hurling heavy objects, just as Regan isn't much for fetching heavy, medium-weight or even light ones. She can't be bothered with all that back-and-forth when there are soft patches of grass on which to sun herself. It's a dog's life.
"Words Worth Sidelining" is a recurring newsletter feature.
For the Love of Sentences
In The Washington Post, Mattie Kahn took issue with the word "fearless" being applied so often and fashionably to young women today: "We haven't really created a generation of unflinching girls. With our broken world, we've scared them into action." (Thanks to Olga Adler of Delray Beach, Fla., for nominating this.)
Also in the Post, Paul Waldman took the measure of Mike Pence's appeal beyond the Republican primaries: "Voters are not clamoring for someone to tell them why we need to cut taxes for the rich and outlaw abortion, delivered in the tone of a stepdad explaining why you're being grounded for the rest of the school year." (Adam Schmuckler, Olney, Md., and Alfred Reid, Durham, N.C.)
And David Von Drehle used the occasion of the P.G.A.-LIV golf merger to reflect on the odd career of a golfer centrally involved in it: "Greg Norman with a four-stroke lead in a major tournament was like a cat leaping onto a narrow shelf of Limoges. You just covered your eyes and waited for the sound of disaster." (Christopher Dodson, Montville, N.J., and Joe Bohr, Park City, Utah, among others) Von Drehle's article also had the clever observation that "golf was for decades -- for centuries -- the province of people who cared about money but never spoke of it openly. Scots. Episcopalians. Members of the Walker and Bush families. People who built huge homes then failed to heat them properly. People who drove around with big dogs in their old Mercedes station wagons. People who greeted the offer of a scotch and soda by saying, 'Well, it's 5 o'clock somewhere!"' (Jessica N. Lange, Beavercreek, Ohio)
In The Times, Kurt Streeter reassessed the PGA's onetime pose of rectitude in light of the merger: "The PGA Tour presented itself as the guy who calls a penalty on himself if he accidentally moves his ball a quarter-inch. Turns out it was the guy who makes a double-bogey and marks it down as a par." (John Daly, Richmond, Va., and Doug Hardy, Concord, Mass., among others)
Also in The Times, Ezra Klein marveled at how little, in the end, Republicans extracted from the debt-ceiling standoff: "Threatening default -- and we came within days of it this time -- in order to get a deal like this is like threatening to detonate a bomb beneath the bank unless the teller gives you $ 150 and a commemorative mug." (Will Rothfuss, Stroudsburg, Penn., and Anita Moran, San Francisco, among many others)
In The New Yorker, Amanda Petrusich examined Paul Simon's newest album, "Seven Psalms," a deeply spiritual reflection on human life: "Outside religious spaces, posing the big questions -- how we arrived here; what we're supposed to do with the time we've been allotted -- is generally considered the terrain of undergraduate philosophy majors and people who have gravely misjudged their tolerance for edibles." (Helen Pelletier, Portland, Maine, and Michael O'Keefe, San Juan Cosala, Mexico, among many others)
An article in The Economist assessed DeSantis's apparent reticence and long delay before he squarely took on Donald Trump: "It is as if Brutus had overslept on the Ides of March, giving Julius Caesar a chance to put on his armor, but had tried to proceed with his hit job all the same. The plot to overthrow Mr. Trump, which once seemed plausible, now looks forlorn." (Howard Stambor, Seattle, and Harry Gerecke, Vashon, Wash.)
And in GQ, Alex Pappademas had a grand time profiling the musician Dave Matthews and noted that when "someone tells you they don't like Dave Matthews, they're really voicing a deep tribal aversion to the type of person they picture when they picture a Dave Matthews fan -- spiritually incurious trustafarians, pumpkin-spice basics, fleece-vest I.P.A. bros, or whichever straw-man stereotype offends their imagination most." Matthews owns a Tesla "but he's a little embarrassed by it -- specifically the gull-wing doors, because it's basically impossible to be a rock star and get out of a car with gull-wing doors without looking like an asshole, especially if you're wearing sunglasses." (Kate Schultz, Madison, Wis.)

On a Personal Note
The presidential race is heating up, even at this early stage. The war between Ukraine and Russia continues to rage. Robert Kennedy Jr. is cyber-hobnobbing with Elon Musk, in a convergence of runaway vanity and ruinous nonsense that's scarily emblematic of the United States circa 2023.
But the article that everybody I know was talking about most over the past week was Tim Alberta's profile in The Atlantic of Chris Licht, who had been in charge at CNN for 13 baffling and tumultuous months and, it turned out, was days away from being canned.
That's largely because my circle of acquaintance is bloated with people in the news business. We can navel-gaze with the best of them. But it also reflects the richness of the portrait of Licht that Alberta deftly paints.
His article (behind a paywall, which may or may not block you) is about more than CNN, more than Licht. It's about tendencies and traps that many people have skirted or tumbled into. It's about confidence bleeding into grandiosity, defensiveness edging into reclusiveness, bluntness becoming coldness. It examines the lies we tell ourselves about the deals and compromises we've made.
The key scene, for me, is the one in which Licht huffs, puffs and perspires at an elite gym with a quirky personal trainer. He hoists a heavy pole. He does a side plank. He pushes a weighted sleigh. He tells Alberta, who's there, "Zucker couldn't do this shit." That's Jeff Zucker, who ran CNN before him.
What's the point of that statement? And why is Licht letting Alberta watch him work out? One answer -- which I can relate to as a large person who struggles to lose weight -- is that Licht was 226 pounds three years ago but 178 when Alberta spent time with him. He's surely proud of that.
But what's also happening in that scene -- what apparently happened during the whole of Licht's time at CNN -- is that someone who built his career making other people (Joe Scarborough, Stephen Colbert, Gayle King) look good is overly relishing his moment in the spotlight. He's forgetting what his job is. He's losing sight of the larger picture.
It's a recognizable human error. And it's a cautionary tale with resonance far beyond the world of journalism.

50 Years Later, Secretariat's Legend Rolls On: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Fifty years after Secretariat clinched the Triple Crown with a runaway win in the Belmont Stakes, fans still long to connect with his story.
It was a performance for the ages, growing more mythic as time goes on. Having won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes in record fashion, Secretariat rocketed out of the starting gate on June 9, 1973 -- his best start yet -- and never let up. He moved "liked a tremendous machine," as the announcer Chic Anderson put it, and crushed his competition by a whopping 31 lengths to win the Belmont Stakes on an uncomfortably warm but utterly joyous afternoon at Belmont Park.
Like his lead in the Belmont, his legend has swelled even though his youngest current fans had not even been born when he was crowned the ninth Triple Crown champion and the first in 25 years. Nine of the best 3-year-olds in the country will face off Saturday during the 50th anniversary celebration of Secretariat's Triple Crown feat, but none will even come close to achieving the superstar status of the big red horse.
"I was amazed with that horse all along," said his jockey, Ron Turcotte, who at 81 is the lone survivor of Secretariat's inner circle, which included the owner Penny Chenery, the trainer Lucien Laurin and the groom Eddie Sweat. "He was doing things that we've never seen before that we'll probably never see again."
In the Derby, Secretariat broke a step slow, but Turcotte, unworried, let the colt find his legs and run his race. At the top of the stretch, Turcotte asked for more, and Secretariat zipped past his rival Sham to win by two and a half lengths in 1 minute 59⅖ seconds. He ran each quarter-mile faster than the one before, unheard-of in horse racing.
In the Preakness, Turcotte made a bold decision to launch a spectacular move on the first turn. After taking the lead, Secretariat was never challenged, and he won by two and a half lengths. Sham again settled for second. Secretariat's final time was recorded as 1:55, a second slower than the Preakness record. But clockers recorded faster times, and by Monday, the stewards voted to change the official time to their clocker's mark of 1:54⅖, still short of the record. It wasn't until 2012, after Chenery hired companies to conduct a forensic review of the race using technology that hadn't existed in 1973, that the Maryland Racing Commission agreed to change the official time to 1:53, establishing the record at last.
Then came the Belmont, his pièce de résistance. If Anderson's call of the race was the pinnacle of his lyrical craft, then a picture credited to the track photographer Bob Coglianese was its visual counterpart. It shows Secretariat head on, hooves hovering above the track in full flight, as Turcotte looks over his left shoulder at the timer that would register Secretariat as running the Belmont in 2:24, two seconds faster than any horse before or after. A blue-and-white checked pole -- the color of Chenery's silks -- marks the margin of victory, almost unbelievable in scope. "I still had a lot of horse when I passed the wire," Turcotte said. "He wasn't even sweating."
Adam Coglianese, who took over as official track photographer when his father retired, said of the photograph: "That stride is exactly what we would look for today. It's basically dumb luck. When you shoot one frame, like they did back then, you can't plan what you're going to get."
A recent account questioned whether Bob Coglianese, who was the New York Racing Association's track photographer for over 50 years, had taken the picture at all. Adam Coglianese disputed any claim to the contrary but acknowledged that he knew little of the particulars of the black-and-white shot, including whether it had even been developed that night.
"He was very cautious about everything we did," Adam Coglianese said of his father. "I don't think people understand what goes into preparing for a Triple Crown. For weeks going into American Pharoah's race, I was drawing a map of where each of my 20 photographers would stand."
Whether Bob Coglianese, who died last year at 88, or someone else on his team shot the image only seems to add to the horse's legend, which extended far beyond the racetrack.
Star Status, in Retirement and Death
In Paris, Ky., off Secretariat Way, sits Claiborne Farm, one of America's most storied breeding operations. Its black-and-yellow breeding shed, built in 1910, has produced 22 winners of the Derby, 20 of the Preakness, 22 of the Belmont and six of the 13 Triple Crown champions, including Secretariat.
A corner stall in the stallion barn still bears Secretariat's name and that of his sire, Bold Ruler, among those of other elites who have inhabited the space. Father and son are buried behind the office in a graveyard that is a who's who of thoroughbred royalty.
On most days, Secretariat's modest gravestone is draped with mementos from fans, who mark every birthday and anniversary with roses -- some red, some painted blue. They also leave pennies, a nod to Chenery, an unlikely heroine who took over her father's farm early in Secretariat's career and saved it with the horse's Triple Crown run and the $ 6.08 million syndication of his breeding rights, a record at the time.
"He kind of was like a rallying cry for America," the Claiborne president, Walker Hancock, said, invoking the era of Richard Nixon, the Watergate scandal and the end of the Vietnam War. "He kind of brought everyone together after everyone was so divided."
Secretariat's popularity -- he graced the covers of Time, Newsweek and Sports Illustrated and was the subject of a Disney movie -- reinvigorated the farm from the day he arrived on Nov. 12, 1973, when several hundred people greeted him at Blue Grass Airport in Lexington. Thousands more flocked to Claiborne each year. So many showed up that a privacy fence had to be erected alongside the road.
"They thought they could just walk over and pet a stallion," Joe Peel, the stallion manager, said with a chuckle.
The tours have continued since Secretariat's death on Oct. 4, 1989, at age 19 from laminitis, a painful hoof disease. Dr. Thomas Swerczek of the University of Kentucky performed Secretariat's necropsy and estimated his heart to be about 21 to 22 pounds, or nearly two and a half times larger than the average thoroughbred's.
As with the photograph, there is no proof, as the necropsy was performed hastily and without proper equipment and documentation, according to an interview in 2020. But Swerczek stood by his assertion until he died last year at 82.
Outlasting the Field, and Time
The National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., has not had a traveling exhibit in over two decades. It took Secretariat's milestone to get the museum back on the road.
The exhibit, titled "A Tremendous Machine" after Anderson's call of the race, has followed Secretariat's Triple Crown path, traveling to Louisville, Baltimore and now Elmont, N.Y. Its final stop will be at Colonial Downs in September because Secretariat was born in Virginia, at Chenery's Meadow Farm.
Along the way, organizers have been collecting stories and photographs from visitors. Some saw Secretariat race; others visited him at the farm. Some owned his descendants. Several have locks of his hair. One man, who was stationed overseas while in the Army in 1973, recalled listening to the Belmont on the radio and crying tears of joy.
"It just makes people feel so good," said Cate Masterson, the director of the museum, which will host a larger Secretariat exhibit this summer. "It's a trip down memory lane."
In Paris, Secretariat's adopted hometown, a new three-story mural gives the appearance of Turcotte and Secretariat charging down Main Street. A park and a statue are planned beneath.
Lyra Miller, who operates a bed-and-breakfast on her horse farm, hosts visitors who return yearly to visit Secretariat's grave. She also owns a diner on Main Street named Lil's Coffee Shop.
The week of the Derby, she chatted with regulars, one of whom was a 96-year-old veterinarian, Dr. Robert Copelan, who treated Secretariat during his Triple Crown quest. The feat was fresh on people's minds even 50 years later. One by one, they pondered the legends: the records, the earth-shattering performance, the woman in charge, the champion's heart.
"It's crazy, isn't it?" Miller said. "People talk about him as if he's still alive. In a way, he still is."

It was a performance for the ages, growing more mythic as time goes on. Having won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes in record fashion, Secretariat rocketed out of the starting gate on June 9, 1973 — his best start yet — and never let up. He moved “liked a tremendous machine,” as announcer Chic Anderson put it, and crushed his competition by a whopping 31 lengths to win the Belmont Stakes on an uncomfortably warm but utterly joyous afternoon at Belmont Park.
Like his lead in the Belmont, his legend has swelled even though his youngest current fans had not even been born when he was crowned the ninth Triple Crown champion and the first in 25 years. Nine of the best 3-year-olds in the country will face off Saturday during the 50th anniversary celebration of Secretariat’s Triple Crown feat, but none will even come close to achieving the superstar status of the big red horse.
“I was amazed with that horse all along,” said his jockey, Ron Turcotte, who at 81 is the lone survivor of Secretariat’s inner circle, which included owner Penny Chenery, trainer Lucien Laurin and groom Eddie Sweat. “He was doing things that we’ve never seen before that we’ll probably never see again.”
In the Derby, Secretariat broke a step slow, but Turcotte, unworried, let the colt find his legs and run his race. At the top of the stretch, Turcotte asked for more, and Secretariat zipped past his rival Sham to win by 2 1/2 lengths in 1 minute, 59 2/5 seconds. He ran each quarter-mile faster than the one before, unheard-of in horse racing.
In the Preakness, Turcotte made a bold decision to launch a spectacular move on the first turn. After taking the lead, Secretariat was never challenged, and he won by 2 1/2 lengths. Sham again settled for second. Secretariat’s final time was recorded as 1:55, a second slower than the Preakness record. But clockers recorded faster times, and by Monday, the stewards voted to change the official time to their clocker’s mark of 1 minute, 54 2/5 seconds, still short of the record. It wasn’t until 2012, after Chenery hired companies to conduct a forensic review of the race using technology that hadn’t existed in 1973, that the Maryland Racing Commission agreed to change the official time to 1:53, establishing the record at last.
Then came the Belmont, his pièce de résistance. If Anderson’s call of the race was the pinnacle of his lyrical craft, then a picture credited to track photographer Bob Coglianese was its visual counterpart. It shows Secretariat head on, hooves hovering above the track in full flight, as Turcotte looks over his left shoulder at the timer that would register Secretariat as running the Belmont in 2:24, two seconds faster than any horse before or after. A blue-and-white checked pole — the color of Chenery’s silks — marks the margin of victory, almost unbelievable in scope. “I still had a lot of horse when I passed the wire,” Turcotte said. “He wasn’t even sweating.”
Adam Coglianese, who took over as official track photographer when his father retired, said of the photograph: “That stride is exactly what we would look for today. It’s basically dumb luck. When you shoot one frame, like they did back then, you can’t plan what you’re going to get.”
A recent account questioned whether Bob Coglianese, who was the New York Racing Association’s track photographer for over 50 years, had taken the picture at all. Adam Coglianese disputed any claim to the contrary but acknowledged that he knew little of the particulars of the black-and-white shot, including whether it had even been developed that night.
“He was very cautious about everything we did,” Adam Coglianese said of his father. “I don’t think people understand what goes into preparing for a Triple Crown. For weeks going into American Pharoah’s race, I was drawing a map of where each of my 20 photographers would stand.”
Whether Bob Coglianese, who died last year at 88, or someone else on his team shot the image only seems to add to the horse’s legend, which extended far beyond the racetrack.
Star Status Until the End
In Paris, Kentucky, off Secretariat Way, sits Claiborne Farm, one of America’s most storied breeding operations. Its black-and-yellow breeding shed, built in 1910, has produced 22 winners of the Derby, 20 of the Preakness, 22 of the Belmont and six of the 13 Triple Crown champions, including Secretariat.
A corner stall in the stallion barn still bears Secretariat’s name and that of his sire, Bold Ruler, among those of other elites who have inhabited the space. Father and son are buried behind the office in a graveyard that is a who’s who of thoroughbred royalty.
On most days, Secretariat’s modest gravestone is draped with mementos from fans, who mark every birthday and anniversary with roses — some red, some painted blue. They also leave pennies, a nod to Chenery, an unlikely heroine who took over her father’s farm early in Secretariat’s career and saved it with the horse’s Triple Crown run and the $6.08 million syndication of his breeding rights, a record at the time.
“He kind of was like a rallying cry for America,” Claiborne President Walker Hancock said, invoking the era of Richard Nixon, the Watergate scandal and the end of the Vietnam War. “He kind of brought everyone together after everyone was so divided.”
Secretariat’s popularity — he graced the covers of Time, Newsweek and Sports Illustrated and was the subject of a Disney movie — reinvigorated the farm from the day he arrived on Nov. 12, 1973, when several hundred people greeted him at Blue Grass Airport in Lexington. Thousands more flocked to Claiborne each year. So many showed up that a privacy fence had to be erected alongside the road.
“They thought they could just walk over and pet a stallion,” Joe Peel, the stallion manager, said with a chuckle.
The tours have continued since Secretariat’s death on Oct. 4, 1989, at age 19 from laminitis, a painful hoof disease. Dr. Thomas Swerczek of the University of Kentucky performed Secretariat’s necropsy and estimated his heart to be about 21 to 22 pounds, or nearly 2 1/2 times larger than the average thoroughbred’s.

She's Done With School (on TV, Anyway): [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: With the final season of "Never Have I Ever," the actress is graduating from her first onscreen role. Next up: a (nonfictional) college degree.
Which boy does the actress Maitreyi Ramakrishnan want her character to wind up with by the end of "Never Have I Ever"?
Apparently, it depends on the day -- at least as far as most reporters are aware.
"OK, in this interview, I'll be honest -- I'm going to let you in on my plan," Ramakrishnan, 21, said ahead of the comedy's fourth and final season, which arrived Thursday on Netflix. That plan: to give different answers to different publications in her other exit interviews.
Why go to the trouble? Mostly, it seems, to mess with people.
But it was also her way of dismissing the debate entirely. Should her character, Devi, the show's self-sabotaging and sex-obsessed teen protagonist, choose the swoon-worthy swim captain, Paxton (Darren Barnet)? Should she choose Ben (Jaren Lewison), a certified nerd and Devi's sworn scholastic rival? Should Ramakrishnan care?
"Both guys, they're great," she said. But Devi is so young, she added. "When I think about my 17-year-old self, I wouldn't want her to tie herself down. Like, go to college, bro. Live your life."
When we last saw Devi, she had about as much life as she could handle. She had just cashed in Ben's handwritten coupon for "one free boink" -- and, in doing so, traded in her long-detested V-Card. The final season picks up in the chaos of the aftermath, but Devi also has to focus on her academic future as she heads into senior year. There are friendships and romantic prospects to balance, yes, but also admissions counselors to meet, universities to visit.
Ramakrishnan, who grew up just outside Toronto, in Mississauga, Ontario, was once a normal teenager navigating high school herself, a first-generation daughter of Tamil immigrants from Sri Lanka. Like Devi, who is Indian American, she was raised in a multigenerational home -- and still lives there with her family. She is also, like Devi, an ardent nerd in her own right. (Her Instagram account is filled with past cosplay looks, and she spent the last several minutes of our call bestowing video game tips.)
Any sense of normalcy changed quickly after she answered an open casting call during her senior year, in 2019, from Mindy Kaling and Lang Fisher, the creators of "Never." She beat out more than 15,000 others for the role, her first professional acting gig. Other jobs have followed: She lent her voice to the Disney/Pixar animated feature "Turning Red" (2022), and she has been cast in the upcoming Netflix film "The Netherfield Girls," a modern adaptation of "Pride and Prejudice."
In a video call late last month from an Airbnb in Los Angeles, Ramakrishnan shared her thoughts about wrapping up the series, finishing her first full year of college and sharing said Airbnb with her grandmother. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Many of Devi's experiences are outlandish on the surface, but the emotions she is dealing with are relatable. Did you have a similar high-school experience?
I wasn't boy crazy like Devi; I was always friends-first. But the biggest lesson I related to was her self-love journey, about learning to like herself first. You have to be OK with your own silence.
Do you think you've reached that point with yourself?
I've learned that it ebbs and flows. That happens with any new relationship, right? It's not a linear journey, for sure. I'm definitely better than where I was when I was 17. I used to get really mad at myself for being someone who wore her heart on her sleeve. When I liked a guy, I would straight up just go tell him. Like: "Hey, man. This is it. I like you." I went through a phase where I stopped doing that, out of just being scared.
Having your heart on your sleeve is such a big Devi thing.
That's why I got this tattoo! [She holds up her arm and points to the inside of her elbow, where there is an illustration of an anatomically correct heart.] It's kind of a "Never Have I Ever" tattoo. One of the best lines in the show is Dr. Ryan [Devi's therapist, played by Niecy Nash] saying, "Devi, you feel a lot, and that means you're going to hurt a lot, but it means you're going to live such a beautiful and rich life." Oh my God, when I'm crying in that scene, I'm actually crying because that's me -- in that moment, I just bawled. I was like, There's nothing wrong with how I feel. I do feel a lot.
This is one of those shows where you want to scream at the screen when Devi does something stupid. But we still root for her for four seasons. Why do you think we stay on her side?
I wish I had a video of fans reacting to Devi's most idiotic moments. My reaction when I read the script is always like, [sucks in a sharp breath through her teeth] ooo-kay. But I think the reason people can root for her goes back to the core of her mess-ups coming from real places. It's easier sometimes to tell our friends and family the things they deserve and the way we see them. But when we look in the mirror, it's hard for us to say that we deserve the same respect -- that we, too, are just as beautiful. I think Devi is that messy friend that we really see in ourselves.
How did you handle those heavier scenes about the death of Devi's father?
Mindy and Lang helped walk through how it felt for them with their respective parents, but it was also just learning how to feel openly sad. Actors get this awesome opportunity to cry, and then at the end of it, no one asks us, "Are you OK?" We get applauded. We can full-on have a meltdown and everyone goes: "Oh my God. Amazing." And sometimes that's great. Sometimes it's a lot. When going into those scenes, I try to recognize we're making a different show -- still comedic, but tonally, we're going to feel sad now. But that's life, right? It's comedic, and then it gets really sad and you have a dead dad dream.
There is plenty of focus on Devi's mother (Poorna Jagannathan), which isn't very common in shows about high school.
Yeah, 100 percent, the whole family dynamic. I think one of my favorite parts of "Never Have I Ever" was the addition of Devi's grandma. Because I'm really close to my grandma -- right now, actually. In this Airbnb that I'm staying at. My grandma and I are bunking with each other. But I grew up with my mom, my grandma and my great-grandma all under the same roof. And my dad, my brother, my grandpa -- but four generations of women, that was what I'm used to. Family discussions in my house are like pingpong matches. I think the Vishwakumars do the same thing. And Nirmala [Devi's grandmother, played by Ranjita Chakravarty]? She's got sass. That's my grandma. I definitely got my overdramatic self from her.
So much of this season follows Devi's journey to get into college. Has it made you think about going back to school? [Ramakrishnan deferred her acceptance to York University's theater program in Toronto when she was cast.]
I actually am back. Dude, I finished my mandatory science, and I could not be happier.
Which one was it?
Astronomy. It's such an art kid thing to do. Like, ooh! Stars! Ooh! Planets! Space! My whole approach to school right now is to get ahead where I can, but I'm on no timeline. Obviously, it's been four years and I didn't get it done and I'm still alive. But I do genuinely just love learning. My degree now is in human rights and equity studies. My parents think I'm a sadist, just for doing all the work that I do at once. I will pat myself on the back for getting through my whole semester with decent grades -- I am a "Cs get degrees" kind of person, but I did way better.
How do you feel about how the series ended?
It could have gone into a Team Ben or Team Paxton win at the end, and I'd be pretty indifferent. I think it's pretty awesome that she's grown up so much. I'm just Team Devi; I really am. I'm about her independence, her making mistakes, just learning what she likes. I will die on this hill. I think people think I'm lying, but I genuinely am all about letting a woman be a woman.

Pat Robertson, Who Reshaped U.S. Politics From Pulpit, Dies at 93: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A Baptist minister and a broadcaster, he turned evangelicals into a powerful constituency that helped Republicans capture Congress in 1994. He earlier ran for president.
Pat Robertson, a Baptist minister with a passion for politics who marshaled Christian conservatives into a powerful constituency that helped Republicans capture both houses of Congress in 1994, died on Thursday at his home in Virginia Beach, Va. He was 93.
His death was announced by the Christian Broadcasting Network, which Mr. Robertson founded in 1960.
Mr. Robertson built an entrepreneurial empire based on his Christian faith, encompassing a university, a law school, a cable channel with broad reach, and more. A product of a family with politics in its veins, he also waged a serious though unsuccessful campaign for the 1988 Republican presidential nomination, resigning as a Baptist minister as he began the run in the face of criticism about mixing church and state.
The loss did not dampen his political fervor; he went on to found the Christian Coalition, which stoked the conservative faith-based political resurgence of the 1990s and beyond.
Whether in the pulpit, on the stump or in front of a television camera, Mr. Robertson could exhibit the mild manner of a friendly local minister, chuckling softly and displaying an almost perpetual twinkle in his eye. But he was also given to statements that his detractors saw as outlandishly wrongheaded and dangerously incendiary.
He suggested, for example, that Americans' sinfulness had brought on the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against the United States, and that the earthquake that devastated Haiti in 2010 was divine retribution for a promise that Haitians had made to serve the Devil in return for his help in securing the country's independence from France in 1804.
He said that liberal Protestants embodied "the spirit of the Antichrist" and that feminism drove women to witchcraft. He called for the assassination of President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela. He maintained that his prayers had averted hurricanes. And he condemned homosexuality as "an abomination," linking it at one point it to the rise of Hitler and declaring that it provokes God's wrath, as manifested in natural disasters and even the death and destruction of 9/11.
In December 2020, amid intensifying efforts by President Donald J. Trump and his supporters to overturn the election, Mr. Robertson told viewers of his television show, "The 700 Club," that a lawsuit filed by the Texas attorney general challenging results in four states was a "miracle."
"They're going to the Supreme Court to say, 'This election was rigged and you've got to overturn it,"' Mr. Robertson said, citing unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. He declared that "God himself" would intervene.
Barely two weeks later, he changed course. "The president still lives in an alternate reality," he said, adding: "I think it would be well to say, 'You've had your day and it's time to move on."'
David John Marley, the author of "Pat Robertson: An American Life" (2007), said that Mr. Robertson's statements were calculated to arouse his core following: Christians who felt ignored or mistreated by elites.
"The more he is publicly vilified, the more his minority-under-attack thesis appears to be true," Mr. Marley wrote.
It had become a potent constituency. In 1986, Ed Rollins, who managed President Ronald Reagan's 1984 re-election campaign, said Mr. Robertson had "more assets than the Republican National Committee."
In his presidential campaign, in 1988, Mr. Robertson finished a strong second in the Iowa caucuses, but later dropped out of the race when it became clear that George Bush would clinch the nomination.
Mr. Robertson's Christian Coalition reached the peak of its influence in 1994, when it helped to elect the first Republican Congress in decades. It had a budget of around $ 25 million and a membership of four million or more.
Many thought politics was Mr. Robertson's natural home, though few doubted the sincerity of his religious practice, which included speaking in tongues and faith healing.
His father was Absalom Willis Robertson, a Democratic United States congressman and senator from Virginia for 34 years who fiercely defended the conservative agenda of his day, including segregation and opposition to the New Deal.
Garrett Epps, an author and legal scholar, wrote in The Washington Post in 1986 that political analysts "treat Pat as if he came from Mars, rather than finding antecedents of many positions in the political stands his father took a generation ago."
Preachers and Politics
Marion Gordon Robertson was born on March 22, 1930, in Lexington, Va., to parents who were cousins and the offspring of Baptist preachers. His youth was shaped by his proximity to Washington policymakers, and by his father's insistence that he learn the value of work and responsibility through backbreaking farm labor.
His mother, born Gladys Churchill Willis, imbued him with religious faith, and with a sense of pride in a genealogy that included two presidents (William Henry Harrison and Benjamin Harrison). She told him God had a plan for him.
He was called Pat because, when he was a baby, his older brother and only sibling, A. Willis Robertson Jr., had patted him on his cheeks, saying, "Pat, pat, pat."
Pat attended the McCallie School, at the time a military prep school, in Chattanooga, Tenn., and graduated from Washington and Lee University in Virginia. He spent a year at the University of London, then joined the Marines. He avoided combat in Korea, which some attributed to the influence of his senator father.
He went to Yale Law School, where he met a nursing student, Adelia Elmer, known as Dede. They secretly married on Aug. 27, 1954, and their first son, Timothy, was born 10 weeks later. For years the couple said that their wedding date was March 22, 1954. Reporters discovered the Robertsons' marriage certificate in late 1987, after Mr. Robertson had announced his candidacy for the presidency.
"I have never, ever indicated that in the early part of my life I didn't sow some wild oats," he told reporters. "I sowed plenty of them. But I also said that Jesus Christ came into my life, changed my life and forgave me."
Adelia Robertson died in 2022.
Mr. Robertson graduated from Yale, but did not pass the New York State bar examination. He worked as a trainee for W.R. Grace & Company, then as a partner in an audio components firm. A Democrat at the time, he was chairman of the Adlai Stevenson for President Committee on Staten Island, where he lived, in 1956. He wrote that during this period he developed a taste for the "upholstered sewers called nightclubs" and gambled recklessly.
It didn't make him happy. He felt empty, and he considered suicide. An encounter with an evangelist led him to become a committed Christian. He wrote in his autobiography that he took down a painting of a nude over his sofa and poured out his bottle of Courvoisier. He left his pregnant wife and child to attend a Christian camp in Canada for a month. "God will take care of you," he told her.
Back home in New York, he worked briefly at a nonpaying job at a religious magazine before entering the New York Theological Seminary (called the Biblical Seminary in New York at the time), which taught biblical inerrancy. He earned a master's degree in divinity in 1959 and was ordained as a minister in the Southern Baptist Convention in 1961.
He nonetheless worried that his religious conversion was incomplete. Then his son Timothy fell ill with a 105-degree fever. While praying for him, Mr. Robertson found himself speaking in tongues. He became a charismatic Christian.
His strengthened faith prompted him to sell his family's furniture and other belongings, and give the proceeds to Korean orphans. He did this while his wife and children were visiting her family in Ohio. She was furious. Years later, she offered advice to women in similar situations: "God can be your husband," she said.
Birth of a Network
Mr. Robertson moved the family into a rat-infested brownstone parsonage next to a brothel in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. He was a minister to that community when his mother told him that a small, decrepit, off-the-air UHF television station in Portsmouth, Va., was for sale. By his account, he spoke to God, who advised him to offer $ 37,000, much less than the $ 300,000 the seller wanted.
His bid was ultimately accepted, and Mr. Robertson gathered cash from family and friends to start in 1960 what he boldly called the Christian Broadcasting Network.
It went on the air on Oct. 1, 1961, as WYAH-TV, a name taken from the Hebrew word for God, Yahweh. An early fund-raising drive involved asking 700 people to pledge $ 10 a month each, a lot for the time and place. His request was fulfilled. In 1966, that success gave birth to "The 700 Club," which became Mr. Robertson's signature program. The network soon had a game show and a daytime drama, "Another Life," which the station promoted as "the soap with hope."
Mr. Robertson avoided the fire-and-brimstone approach of television preachers like Jimmy Swaggart and the shoot-from-the hip ways of Jerry Falwell. He did a couple of PBS-style telethons a year, rather than constantly asking for money.
"Television is a mass communications vehicle," Mr. Robertson said in a 1995 interview with CNN. "It's not a church service."
Mr. Robertson became one of the first broadcasters to syndicate shows nationally, and one of the first to use satellite transmission, and he started one of the first basic cable networks of any sort.
He was one of the first evangelists to seek commercial sponsors and to use toll-free numbers for prayers and contributions. He was the first religious broadcaster to have a Washington newsroom. He did local broadcasts in foreign countries.
Eventually his broadcasts would be seen in 200 countries and heard in 70 languages, collecting hundreds of millions of dollars in donations and redefining Christian broadcasting by serving up religion as news and entertainment.
His big corporate success was establishing CBN as a satellite network in 1977, and adding secular shows to its programs, mainly reruns of popular family shows like "Flipper" and "Father Knows Best." In 1988, it was renamed the CBN Family Channel to attract advertisers uneasy with overt religion. After the tax authorities questioned its religious exemption, Mr. Robertson split it into for-profit and nonprofit entities.
Sale Price: $ 1.9 Billion
In 1997, Mr. Robertson sold the Family Channel to Fox Kids Worldwide, headed by Rupert Murdoch, for $ 1.9 billion. Fox sold it for $ 5.3 billion in 2001 to Disney, which rebranded it ABC Family and, later, Freeform. Mr. Robertson retained the right to show "The 700 Club" in perpetuity three times a day on the network. Television Week in 2005 called this deal "a perpetual money machine."
Money from the original sale went into a trust used to help finance the CBN broadcasting complex; Regent University, the religious school Mr. Robertson opened as CBN University in Virginia Beach, Va., in 1978; Operation Blessing, a worldwide charity; and the American Center for Law and Justice, a nonprofit Christian legal advocacy group.
Mr. Robertson dealt with many controversies, including his highly publicized break with two of his most popular broadcasters, Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker. (Years later, when Mr. Bakker was embroiled in scandal, Mr. Robertson condemned him.) He was criticized for joining African dictators in mining ventures. He was attacked by other evangelicals for remaining silent on China's promotion of abortion while he was negotiating to set up a network there.
Conservatives were appalled when he appeared with the Rev. Al Sharpton in a commercial warning of global warming in 2008. In fact, many evangelicals felt that an evangelist -- a term Mr. Robertson rejected in favor of "broadcaster" -- had no business in politics in the first place.
But at the time of Watergate, he felt he could not remain silent and called for President Richard M. Nixon to repent.
Mr. Robertson is survived by his two sons, Timothy and Gordon; two daughters, Elizabeth Robertson Robinson and Ann Robertson LeBlanc; 14 grandchildren; and 24 great-grandchildren.
In 2007, Mr. Robertson passed management of CBN to his son Gordon. In 2011, he said he would no longer endorse candidates.
In October 2021, at the age of 91, he announced that he was stepping down as host of the "The 700 Club" after more than 50 years at the helm. "It's been a great run," Mr. Robertson said on the show, adding that his son Gordon Robertson would take over as host.
But he never stopped talking politics -- and his flock never stopped listening. In 2001, Michael Lind, an author on political topics, wrote in The New York Times that Mr. Robertson had been "the most influential figure in American politics in the last decade."

Pat Robertson, a Baptist minister with a passion for politics who marshaled Christian conservatives into a powerful constituency that helped Republicans capture both houses of Congress in 1994, died Thursday at his home in Virginia Beach, Virginia. He was 93.
Robertson built an entrepreneurial empire based on his Christian faith. He also waged a serious although unsuccessful campaign for the 1988 Republican presidential nomination. He went on to found the Christian Coalition, which stoked the conservative faith-based political resurgence of the 1990s and beyond.
Whether in the pulpit, on the stump or in front of a television camera, Robertson could exhibit the mild manner of a friendly local minister, displaying an almost perpetual twinkle in his eye. But he was also given to statements that his detractors saw as incendiary.
He suggested, for example, that Americans’ sinfulness had brought on the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against the United States. He maintained that his prayers had averted hurricanes. And he condemned homosexuality as “an abomination,” linking it at one point it to the rise of Hitler and declaring that it provokes God’s wrath, as manifested in natural disasters and even 9/11.
In December 2020, amid intensifying efforts to overturn the election, Robertson declared that “God himself” would intervene for President Donald Trump. Barely two weeks later, he changed course: “I think it would be well to say, ‘You’ve had your day and it’s time to move on.’”
David John Marley, author of “Pat Robertson: An American Life” (2007), said that Robertson’s statements were calculated to arouse Christians who felt ignored or mistreated by elites. “The more he is publicly vilified, the more his minority-under-attack thesis appears to be true,” Marley wrote.
Robertson’s Christian Coalition reached the peak of its influence in 1994, when it helped to elect the first Republican Congress in decades. It had a budget of around $25 million and a membership of 4 million or more.
Preachers and Politics
Marion Gordon Robertson was born on March 22, 1930, in Lexington, Virginia, to parents who were first cousins and the offspring of Baptist preachers. His youth was shaped by his proximity to Washington policymakers, and by his father’s insistence that he learn the value of work and responsibility through backbreaking farm labor.
His father was Absalom Willis Robertson, a Democratic U.S. congressman and senator from Virginia for 34 years who fiercely defended the conservative agenda of his day, including segregation and opposition to the New Deal.
His mother, the former Gladys Churchill Willis, imbued him with religious faith, and with a sense of pride in a genealogy that included two presidents (William Henry Harrison and Benjamin Harrison). She told him God had a plan for him.
He was called Pat because, when he was a baby, his older brother and only sibling, A. Willis Robertson Jr., had patted him on his cheeks, saying, “Pat, pat, pat.”
He went to Yale Law School, where he met a nursing student, Adelia Elmer, known as Dede. They secretly married on Aug. 27, 1954, and their first son, Timothy, was born 10 weeks later. For years the couple said that their wedding date was March 22, 1954.
“I have never, ever indicated that in the early part of my life I didn’t sow some wild oats,” he said. “I sowed plenty of them. But I also said that Jesus Christ came into my life, changed my life and forgave me.”
Adelia Robertson died in 2022.
Robertson graduated from Yale, but did not pass the New York state bar examination. A Democrat at the time, he was chair of the Adlai Stevenson for President Committee in Staten Island, New York, where he lived, in 1956. He wrote that during this period he developed a taste for nightclubs and gambled recklessly.
It didn’t make him happy. He felt empty, and he considered suicide. An encounter with an evangelist led him to become a committed Christian. He left his pregnant wife and child to attend a Christian camp in Canada for a month. “God will take care of you,” he told her.
He entered the New York Theological Seminary (called the Biblical Seminary in New York at the time), which taught biblical inerrancy. He earned a master’s degree in divinity in 1959 and was ordained as a minister in the Southern Baptist Convention in 1961.
Growth of a Network
Robertson had moved the family into a parsonage in Brooklyn when his mother told him that a small, decrepit, off-the-air UHF television station in Portsmouth, Virginia, was for sale. By his account, he spoke to God, who advised him to offer $37,000, much less than the $300,000 the seller wanted.

A Film Festival With a Story to Tell: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Documentaries about siblings and baseball are among the standouts in the film slate of an event that encompasses a lot more than movies.
Every spring, the Tribeca Festival returns to Lower Manhattan with a bulky mixed bag of creative programming. Looking for virtual reality? Concerts? Video games? Podcast tapings? The event, which dropped "film" from its name in 2021, lassos together all its media with the key word storytelling -- a buzzy, often branded term. Past attendees of the festival might recall Robert De Niro, one of its founders, rapping, "I've got a story to tell," at the start of a bouncy, AT&T-sponsored Tribeca trailer that preceded screenings for half a dozen years.
A tension surrounding this year's event, which runs from Wednesday through June 18, is how it coincides with a wholesale hiatus in storytelling with the Writers Guild strike in its second month and a potential SAG-AFTRA strike hovering on the horizon. The impasse, which pits Hollywood studios against creators, hangs on a question: How much does the system truly value these storytellers? The industry is in crisis, and as the guilds sound alarm bells, it will be interesting to see how Tribeca amplifies their chime.
A top U.S. film festival, Tribeca has long served as a kind of industry nexus, platforming big-studio movies beside indies. Once, the event featured Mario Van Peebles's "Baadasssss!" on the same day as "New York Minute," starring Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. This year, Disney and Pixar's "Elemental" is the centerpiece. The festival has also proven a conduit for filmmakers to go from newcomer to big deal. In 2018, Nia DaCosta premiered the crime drama "Little Woods." She's now directing "The Marvels."
The festival's juiciest titles are often the discoveries, and that was certainly the case for my favorite world premiere this year: "The Gullspang Miracle," a dazzler in the documentary competition. Like the weird love child of "Three Identical Strangers" and "Grey Gardens," the film observes the Norwegian sisters Kari and May in the afterglow of meeting Olaug, an uncanny ringer for their elder sister, Astrid, who died by suicide decades earlier. The director, Maria Fredriksson, accompanies the trio as they plumb this strange serendipity, laying bare destabilizing truths and secrets.
The competing pulls of nature and nurture underpin the film. Kari and May regard their experience as a divine act of God. Nonreligious, Olaug is skeptical, and soon, the women's honeymoon period fizzles into pettiness and pique. An ace calibrator of mood, Fredriksson charts this rift in social settings and a series of charged voice mail messages. Brace for a startling and surreal ride that marries true-crime mysteries with cringe comedy about the narcissism of nanoscopic differences.
Darker in mood and in palette is Ethan Berger's "The Line," an incisive college drama that's equal parts spectacle and parable. Alex Wolff stars as Tom, a sophomore at a Southern liberal arts school shirking his studies to romp and roughhouse with his fraternity brothers in the fictional Kappa Nu Alpha. It's fall rush season, and trouble arrives in Gettys (Austin Abrams), a promising freshman pledge whose swagger nonetheless rubs Tom's truculent roommate, Mitch (Bo Mitchell), the wrong way.
In his narrative feature debut, Berger demonstrates a knack for scene-setting. He paints the fraternity's antebellum mansion not as an animal house but rather as a tenebrous, cocaine-tinctured netherworld peopled with the preppy, white progeny of local fat cats. These boys are homophobes (not to mention racists and sexists), and yet Berger and his co-writer, Alex Russek, deliberately present the brotherhood as buttressed by a vigorous homoeroticism. Tussling is a pastime, penis remarks fill the patois and hazing hinges on a heavy dose of organized spanking.
If all that macho posturing leaves you hungry for some memorable female-driven narratives, look no further than "Richelieu" and "Cold Copy," two absorbing dramas in different registers. Both center on a woman honing her professional credo, albeit to opposite ends: In "Richelieu," Ariane (a stirring Ariane Castellanos) finds purpose as an advocate for others, while Mia (the always-on Bel Powley) of the jittery "Cold Copy" succeeds by stepping on her peers to give herself a boost.
"Richelieu" is set at a Canadian industrial plant, where Ariane is tasked with translating the Québécois French dictates of her boss into the Spanish spoken by the mill's stable of Guatemalan laborers. The filmmaker, Pier-Philippe Chevigny, makes expert use of long takes trailing characters through space, including during a climax guaranteed to leave you breathless. The equally dizzying "Cold Copy," written and directed by Roxine Helberg (once an assistant to Jean-Marc Vallée), tells of a journalism student so desperate to impress her steely professor, Diane (Tracee Ellis Ross), that she'll toss friendships and ethics out the window.
On the nonfiction end, an unusually large chunk of titles center on sports and athletes: basketball, football, baseball, ice hockey, rugby, mixed martial arts and even IndyCar racing are represented. Two standouts consider aspects of what was once called America's pastime, although in a twist, neither focuses on the major leagues. "The Saint of Second Chances," a Netflix bio-doc from Morgan Neville ("Won't You Be My Neighbor?") and Jeff Malmberg ("Marwencol"), has plenty of fun detailing the puckish stunts of independent leagues as it profiles team owner Mike Veeck, a lifelong mischief-maker (and the son of Bill Veeck, a franchise owner).
That documentary finds a rousing kindred spirit in "The League," a poetic collage of archival footage and scholarship arranged with care by the filmmaker Sam Pollard ("MLK/FBI"). The film celebrates the inception, heyday and superstars of the Negro Leagues and analyzes their legacy. There is even some overlap with "The Saint": one section touches on Bill Veeck's signing of the legend Satchel Paige, history's oldest M.L.B. rookie.
Less brawny but just as tireless are the players in Jane M. Wagner's "Break the Game," an innovative film constructed from excerpts from a vast accumulation of livestream recordings on the gaming website Twitch. Our hero is Narcissa Wright, a onetime champion now facing onslaughts of online transphobia. Hoping to set a record on a popular new game, Narcissa becomes a recluse and then an anxious wreck.
What emerges is an internecine tug of war between body and mind, and between the urges to stand out and fit in. The film -- Wagner's first -- is extremely multimedia, which is to say, extremely Tribeca. But more profoundly, the documentary probes the intriguing possibility of taking images meant for one space and repurposing them into a cogent beginning, middle and end. Put another way: Even without the pixelated bells and whistles, it's excellent storytelling.

North Dakota Governor Joins Growing '24 Race: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As the leader of a deep-red state, Mr. Burgum has promoted staunchly conservative policies, signing into law a near-total ban on abortion.
Gov. Doug Burgum, the Republican governor of North Dakota, former software executive and billionaire, announced on Wednesday he would run for president on his economic record, entering an increasingly crowded race as the stolid candidate of business and technology.
"If you want more small-town common sense in Washington and our big cities, we'll make that happen," Mr. Burgum told the crowd at a rally in Fargo, N.D. "We need the governor and business leader who understands this changing economy. I want to earn your vote." He acknowledged the ground he would need to make up to gain his party's presidential nomination but said he had been underestimated before.
The size of the field signals that former President Donald J. Trump, the Republican front-runner, has not scared off many challengers. But he has also yet to fully consolidate support behind his candidacy, and numerous rivals apparently see a path to the nomination, no matter how narrow it might be.
As the leader of his deep-red state, Mr. Burgum has overseen a period of significant economic expansion, but he has also assented to staunchly conservative social policies, even as he has downplayed his role in them.
This year, Mr. Burgum signed into law a near-total ban on abortion and created significant restrictions on gender transition care, including banning any requirements that teachers or school administrators use a student's preferred pronouns.
Such social policies were nowhere to be found in his campaign launch, which largely eschewed partisan appeals to a conservative base and focused on three issues: the economy, energy and national security. Workmanlike in his delivery, with eyes glued on the teleprompters, Mr. Burgum may not look like a political natural, but his hope is that Republican voters will want a solid technician to return the party to its low-tax, deregulatory entrepreneurial roots.
Outside the converted Lutheran church where his rally was held, a clutch of protesters appeared determined not to let him run away from his more recent record. Cody J. Schuler, an advocacy manager at the North Dakota American Civil Liberties Union, acknowledged that as a business leader, Mr. Burgum embraced L.G.B.T.Q. rights as good for all citizens and good for business.
But in signing the bills passed by the conservative North Dakota legislature, Mr. Schuler said, the governor "threw away the lives of North Dakota citizens for his presidential aspirations."
Even Mr. Burgum's most ardent supporters at the rally expressed doubts that the governor of a state of 775,000 could qualify for the all-important primary debates, a bar that now requires 40,000 unique donors and 1 percent in national Republican polls.
"He'll have the resources to be competitive," said Tony Grindberg, a senior manager at North Dakota's electric company who previously served in the State Legislature. "The question is, can he connect with the rest of country? That will be fun to watch as a North Dakotan."
Mr. Burgum is the second sitting governor to enter the race, after Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, who has staked out aggressively conservative social policy positions and attracted the national spotlight for dust-ups with major corporations like Disney.
Yet Mr. Burgum's aides say he is planning a campaign less focused on social issues and more on his business background and fiscal stewardship of the state, which included cuts to both local property taxes and state income taxes.
At his launch, he never mentioned transgender issues or abortion, and put himself forward as a unifying voice -- "a smart guy who has achieved a lot," as his campaign video put it.
"In a country built on neighbors helping neighbors, we've become a country of neighbors fighting neighbors," he said. "We should all be fighting to unite the country."
Though his national media appearances have been scarce, Mr. Burgum has been able to break through during debates over energy policy, offering a window into how he might frame his proposals in contrast to those of Republican rivals and of President Biden. In March, he told Fox News that the Biden administration's economic plan was "disconnected from economics, it's disconnected from physics and it's disconnected from common sense." He argued that Japan and other Asian countries were ripe markets for American energy exports.
His campaign's confidence that he can rise from a relative unknown to legitimate candidate derives from his own political career in North Dakota. When Mr. Burgum announced his bid for governor in 2016, he was an outsider with little name recognition outside Fargo, and his main opponent, Wayne Stenehjem, the state attorney general, received the North Dakota Republican Party's endorsement.
But with ample resources and a campaign that ran to the right -- Mr. Burgum endorsed Donald J. Trump for president in May 2016 -- he cruised to a 20-percentage-point victory that The Bismarck Tribune proclaimed "upended the North Dakota Republican Party establishment." He has not been seriously challenged in North Dakota since.
"There's a value to being underestimated all the time," Mr. Burgum told The Fargo Forum. "That's a competitive advantage."
As one of few major candidates not from the East Coast, and with an upbringing deeply rooted in the rural Midwest, Mr. Burgum is likely to focus most of his efforts in Iowa, a state with an extensive agricultural community. Mr. Burgum grew up in Arthur, N.D., a town of barely 300 where his family owned the grain elevator that still dominates the tiny farming community.
While attending North Dakota State University as an undergraduate, Mr. Burgum began a chimney sweeping service in Fargo out of a friend's pickup truck. His newfound business attracted the attention of local newspapers, who ran photos of a soot-laden Mr. Burgum clad in a tuxedo hopping from roof to roof, picking up roughly $ 40 per chimney.
Mr. Burgum attached those newspaper clips to his applications for business school, and he soon enrolled in Stanford Business School. After earning his M.B.A. at Stanford, Mr. Burgum joined Great Plains Software, a Fargo company that specialized in accounting software, and quickly rose to chief executive.
Far from the more fertile tech hubs of Silicon Valley, Mr. Burgum built Great Plains Software into a major industry player, eventually selling to Microsoft for $ 1.1 billion. He would then serve as a senior vice president at Microsoft until 2007.
Mr. Burgum's worth stretches into nine figures, certainly enough to help finance a nascent presidential run, and his aides expect his business network to help pull in major donors as well. But as of the start of his campaign, no super PAC or outside group has emerged supporting Mr. Burgum's candidacy.

Jenny Lewis Keeps Finding the Magic: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Jenny Lewis didn't mean to wind up with the marimba.
But for the last year, a vintage percussion instrument has occupied pride of place in the singer-songwriter's forest green home studio. She inherited it from her godfather, Jerry Cohen, a music editor for TV and movies and an amateur musician, who died suddenly last spring. He was a surrogate dad to her, the kind who surreptitiously bought Hanukkah presents when money was tight in her household, and introduced her to jazz records when she was 10. She was the only person in the room with him when he passed away.
"He was my mentor and my best friend and the most Jewish of all people in my life," she said. "Jerry would want me to get lessons on the marimba."
Lewis, the 47-year-old indie artist whose country-rock troubadour style and evocative lyricism has earned her comparisons to songwriting greats from Nashville's Music Row to Laurel Canyon, has suffered a lot of loss lately. Her mother's death, in 2017, was the backdrop for her last album, "On the Line," in 2019. Now, after losing Cohen and another mentor, the album designer and her "rock 'n' roll dad" Gary Burden, there is "Joy'All," an album out June 9 that grapples with aging, life cycles and romantic (im)possibility and yet somehow feels vivacious.
"My 40s are kicking my ass," she sings on the third track over peppy acoustic guitars, "and handing them to me in a margarita glass." The song is called "Puppy and a Truck," her latest -- and perhaps most lasting -- prescription for happiness; she scored them both. "Having survived this moment, I felt like it was important to project something joyful," she said.
The dog, Bobby Rhubarb, a shiny black cockapoo, greeted me with a waist-high leap when I visited Lewis recently at her home at the end of a wildflower-lined canyon road in the San Fernando Valley. The house is called Mint Chip -- there's an ice cream cone etched in stained glass by the garage -- and Lewis acquired it after promising to maintain the whimsical touches that the Disney animator who built it in the 1950s installed. It attracts the fantastical too: during the pandemic, Lewis said, she discovered a baby squirrel had been sneaking in and hiding acorns under her pillow.
There is more than a little magic to her life. It's in the way Lewis amplifies the space around her (she decked out that truck, a Chevy Colorado, with ersatz Gucci seat covers) and even the way she made it out of a career as a child actor to succeed in another artistic universe.
"She's a unicorn," said Soleil Moon Frye, her fellow child star ("Punky Brewster") and a friend for decades. Even as a preteen, Lewis had musical skills, said Moon Frye, who documented their Hollywood crew's adolescence in home movies, released as the 2021 documentary "Kid 90." "We would memorize these hip-hop songs -- she was always so good at rapping."
Though she's pegged as a country-tinged folk rock songwriter, Lewis's keystone is still hip-hop, reggae, soul and funk -- "finding the story in rap-style verses and picking up an acoustic guitar, and kind of marrying the two worlds," she said. A printout of the Wikipedia entry for "3 Feet High and Rising," the landmark album by De La Soul, rested on the music stand in her studio; she was paging through it to understand all the samples they had used.
Her references for "Joy'All" included Tracy Chapman, whose conversational delivery she admires, Portishead and Frank Ocean. About half of the tracks for the LP were created over two years in Los Angeles. The rest she made in Nashville, where she has also had a home since 2017. It's her fifth studio album as a solo artist -- she started out in popular indie bands, Rilo Kiley and the Postal Service -- and her first release on Blue Note Records, the storied jazz label. (After her own tour, she'll be joining the Postal Service on the road this fall.)
Dave Cobb, the Nashville producer (Brandi Carlile, John Prine, Chris Stapleton) who worked on the album, was awe-struck by her ease and perennial good moods. "If you don't like Jenny Lewis, you don't like people," he said. Their sessions, tracking instruments like pedal steel and Mellotron, along with birdsong from Lewis's Nashville backyard, flowed easily. "To say she led is absolute, because we all played to her," he said, adding: "Everything she writes about is true. She literally showed up every day with the puppy and her truck."
She has the openness of someone who has spent a lifetime cheerfully talking about herself, and the staggeringly eccentric stories of a showbiz veteran. Sitting on the midnight blue couch in her minimalist living room, Lewis, in a sweatshirt, sunset-hued corduroys and a single gold hoop earring inscribed with her last name, touched on being Jewish; the spiritual guru Ram Dass; the female Elvis impersonator who was her childhood babysitter; the time her mother convinced Lucille Ball to have a sitcom wrap party in their ramshackle house ("Lucy walks in, and she goes, 'What a dump!"'); and the swap meet in Atlanta where she buys knockoff Gucci socks by the armful. "I would never buy a real Gucci sock -- that's so silly," she said.
Telling stories about Cohen, she cried. When she was a child, he took her to his job on the Universal Studios lot and let her draw and animate her own movies using giant old film machines. Being with him when he died "was probably like the most important moment of my whole life," she said.
Lewis's parents, itinerant lounge musicians, split when she was a toddler. Her acting career in the '80s changed the family's fortunes, for a time, but her mother's drug addiction and instability outpaced her sitcom earnings. She was estranged from her parents for decades, then reconciled with each late in their lives. Her father's bass harmonica sits on a stand on her mantel.
"On my dad's deathbed, he basically was like, 'learn musical theory,"' she said. "So there has been this pressure, from my people, to do better and learn more."
Jess Wolfe, one half of the duo Lucius, befriended Lewis and sings backup on "Joy'All." "I really understand the need for trying to lift yourself up through your art and hoping that it can do the same for other people -- she did that, in her cool, effortless Jenny Lewis kind of way," Wolfe said.
"She's always had to figure it out and take care of herself," she added. "She is incredibly resourceful and incredibly clever about how to do something, effectively, efficiently and affordably. Truly, I'm always blown away by her in that sense -- I will always feel creative when I'm around her."
At age 40, after Lewis separated from her longtime partner, the musician Johnathan Rice, she moved to New York for the first time, realizing a teenage ambition. She lived in her pal Annie Clark's (St. Vincent) apartment for two years, starting the side project NAF there with some friends. Then came Nashville, where she learned how to two-step at a honky-tonk across from the Ryman Auditorium.
In a rehearsal at a space covered in red velvet in Nashville last week, which she shared over a video call, Lewis directed her all-female backing band (she seeks out women for the stage and, for this outing, even has a female tour manager -- a relative rarity in the industry, and a first for her). "You guys just pedal on that, and let me do my thing," she said, as they prepared to sing "Acid Tongue," the title track off her 2008 solo debut. "Let's get those 'oohs,"' she instructed. The harmonies rolled in. "Well done," she told them. "It's just feeling confident."
Back in L.A., Lewis had confided that aging as an unfiltered, undoctored music star isn't easy. "I see myself and I don't always love it," she said. "But I'm trying to embrace being a woman in her 40s, and all that has to offer."
She is contentedly single now, though trying out a dating app, and itching to write about it -- even, she admitted, enjoying that more.
"My life is outrageous," she said, although her songwriting is not straight autobiography. "But if I'm being honest, I'm in every single line."

Scott Defends Racial Views In Interview On 'The View': [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The presidential candidate went on the daytime talk show to debate his views about systemic racism. But it was his comments about L.G.B.T.Q. rights that got boos from the audience.
The chatty daytime talk show "The View" might seem like an unlikely platform for Tim Scott, a senator from South Carolina and a presidential candidate, to get his footing with Republican primary voters, but he saw an opening on Monday and tried to make the most of it.
Mr. Scott, the first Black Republican from the South elected to the Senate since Reconstruction, had asked for an audience on the show after a co-host, Joy Behar, said Mr. Scott "doesn't get it" when he denies the existence of systemic racism, which is why, she said, he is a Republican.
Before a largely white, partisan crowd in Des Moines, Iowa, on Saturday, Mr. Scott had promised his appearance would make sparks fly, but in the end, the senator and the co-hosts largely spoke past one another.
He said that suggesting that Black professionals and leaders are exceptions to the Black experience, not the rule, is "a dangerous, offensive, disgusting message to send to our young people today."
"The fact of the matter is we've had an African American president, African American vice president, we've had two African Americans to be secretaries of state," Mr. Scott said. "In my home city, the police chief is African American who's now running for mayor."
At one point, he defended Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida in his fight against Disney, saying that legislation that limits what teachers can say about gender and sexuality in the classroom "was the right issue as relates to our young kids and what they're being indoctrinated with."
The comment prompted boos from the studio audience. Whoopi Goldberg, another co-host, loudly scolded the crowd and said that at "The View," audience members "do not boo."
The field of candidates running for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024 includes Mr. Scott and Larry Elder, a Black conservative commentator, and two Indian American children of immigrants, Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador, and Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur and author.
All four have put personal stories of isolation and struggle at the center of their campaigns, while saying that family stories of discrimination and racism are relics of the past and do not reflect a form of prejudice still embedded in American society.
On "The View," Mr. Scott spoke again of his grandfather, who could not make eye contact with a white pedestrian in his small South Carolina town, Salley, and had to step off the sidewalk to let the white man pass by.
"Progress in America is palpable," he said. "It can be measured in generations."
Such talk goes over well with the largely white audiences that Republican presidential candidates speak to in the primary season. But on "The View," the liberal hosts protested. Sunny Hostin, a co-host who is Black, said she was an exception in the story of Black achievement, as is Mr. Scott and the show's most famous co-host, Whoopi Goldberg.
"When it comes to racial inequality, it persists in five core aspects of life in the U.S. -- economics, education, health care, criminal justice and housing," she said. "At nearly every turn, these achievements were fought, threatened and erased, most often by white violence."
For Republican candidates, such appearances have multiple benefits. They can use them to appeal to audiences beyond the Republican base, and to say they are willing to step out of the bubble of the primary electorate. They can then amplify the jousting before Republican voters, as Donald J. Trump has done with his CNN town hall last month and as Mr. Ramaswamy does when he tells Republican audiences that his appearance on CNN cost the anchor Don Lemon his job.

Persuading Gamers To Slay Monsters In Hell, Forever: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: An addictive formula -- kill enemies and collect the powerful gear they drop -- is back, this time in a transformed video game industry where players now expect free content updates.
With hits like World of Warcraft and Diablo, Blizzard Entertainment is considered a progenitor of the "forever game," addictive experiences that players cannot put down because they seemingly never run out of quests to complete or gear to collect.
Part of Diablo's deviousness was that it took forever to get what you wanted. As players fought through dungeons, slain monsters dropped loot, such as weapons and jewelry, that would empower their characters. Sometimes they were randomly rewarded with rare and exceedingly potent loot, much like pulling a slot machine and hitting the jackpot.
The endless dopamine-inducing hunt was a winning formula that persuaded Diablo players over the past 26 years to invest hundreds, sometimes thousands, of hours into building the perfect character. But as the studio, now part of Activision Blizzard, prepares to release Diablo IV for computers and Xbox and PlayStation consoles on Tuesday, it is modifying its casino-like tactics to build a forever game for modern times.
The industry has transformed since Diablo III was released more than a decade ago. Diablo IV will now face an array of online competitors, not just other formidable forever games like Destiny and Fortnite, but also streaming services like Netflix and Disney+ that are battling to monopolize people's time.
"Games have become more of a hobby or a lifestyle," said Rod Fergusson, the Blizzard executive producer overseeing Diablo IV. "That does mean that you have to think about it as this live service."
The old-school video game model, which Blizzard still uses for World of Warcraft, asked those who wanted additional gameplay to pay for expansion packs known as DLC, for downloadable content. But players now expect regular updates for free, with publishers instead making money from the sale of cosmetic upgrades to an engaged fan base.
Taking cues from modern forever games, Blizzard plans to release quarterly updates to Diablo IV that introduce new quests, story lines, items and gameplay mechanics. People who engage each season can unlock in-game rewards through battle passes, an industrywide tactic for player retention.
Facing the increased demands for additional content, Blizzard is emphasizing the storytelling that in past Diablo games was treated like an afterthought. Diablo IV returns to a dark, heavy metal aesthetic and centers on the antagonist Lilith, the daughter of the Lord of Hatred, who has been resurrected by cultists; player-controlled sorcerers, barbarians, rogues, necromancers and druids will pursue her as she wreaks havoc.
In a first for the franchise, Blizzard said, each player's unique character will be rendered in real time to appear inside the cinematic sequences intended to make Diablo IV's story more immersive. And although defeated foes will continue to litter rare items at random, there will now be dungeons and quests where specific pieces of gear, like a special pair of boots or a dagger, can be found.
"Valuing people's time and their experience -- they don't want to feel like they're in a fight with the game," Fergusson said. "Players have come to expect to have some control over the situation."
There is no guarantee that longtime Diablo fans will appreciate the changes. Diablo III featured a virtual auction house where players could buy and sell gear with real money, but Blizzard shut down the store after concluding that it "ultimately undermines Diablo's core gameplay: kill monsters to get cool loot."
Major game studios pour resources into their biggest games, and Fergusson said the Diablo IV team, composed of hundreds of employees, was roughly double that behind the game's predecessor. One group is focusing on the main story while two others are working on parallel tracks for season updates; another works on player customizations, such as the character outfits that are a key part of the game's long-term plan to make money.
Gamers who have immersed themselves in franchises like League of Legends or Apex Legends will be familiar with the approach Blizzard is taking with Diablo IV.
The studio said each quarterly update would showcase fresh story lines, including quests featuring old and new characters, and concepts that shift the dynamics of how the game was played. Players who complete certain tasks will be able to unlock perks, including currency that can be used to buy cosmetic upgrades; though anyone can play on a free tier of the battle pass, those who spend $ 10 a month get access to a more exclusive set of premium outfits.
Jose Zagal, a professor who teaches courses on video game design at the University of Utah, said the forever game model was beneficial for workers, who experience more job stability when projects are extended years beyond their release date.
Yet he had mixed feelings about the implications for players. While they can get more hours of entertainment per dollar from forever games, he said, they are all essentially the same soap opera.
"Imagine you only watch one TV show and it was the only thing you watched," Zagal said. "That is a bit of an unintended consequence of this shift toward really focusing hard on making the game work like a hobby. Are you getting interesting new gameplay experiences?"
Blizzard features different revenue models for its games -- while Hearthstone and Overwatch 2 are both free to play with optional microtransactions, World of Warcraft requires a monthly subscription. Diablo IV is trying to reap the benefits of multiple models by charging $ 70 for the game while also accumulating revenue from the players who buy cosmetic upgrades.
Fans of other games have been happy to shell out cash for the outfits known as skins, said Lewis Ward, an analyst who studies the gaming industry for IDC, the research firm. "It's an ego thing," he said. "It's basically a way to insert your own expression into the game environment."
Zagal added that Diablo IV's approach would allow Blizzard to extract revenue from different groups of players; longtime fans who are now parents might only have time to play through the game once, while players with fewer constraints could commit to playing the game in perpetuity.
Although previous Diablo games were fairly linear, Diablo IV embraces the popular open-world format where players can freely explore their environment and complete optional tasks at their leisure before resuming the main story.
The loose open-world structure also enables incentives for gamers to keep coming back for more. Each day, timed events will trigger at a random hour and location in Diablo IV, at which point up to 12 players can congregate to fight a boss together and earn special loot.
By making a modern forever game, Blizzard's staff has committed to producing Diablo IV for eternity (or at least for as long as enough people are playing it). Fergusson said the effort was worthwhile because although gamers now have unfettered access to digital content, they tend to talk about the one game they played all year, not the new game they played each month.
"You definitely have to have a team," he said, "that can respond to that consumptive nature of players to say, 'Hey, you want a new experience in this existing game? How do I keep giving that to you?"'

Wall Street Takes a Dim View of French Finances as Pressures on Macron Mount: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: S&P Global restated a negative outlook for France's ability to repay mounting debt. Two other ratings agencies have lowered their views in recent weeks.
To the list of challenges facing President Emmanuel Macron after raucous nationwide demonstrations over his pension measures, add a new one: a cascade of warnings over France's finances.
On Friday, S&P Global cautioned that it still had a negative outlook on France's creditworthiness. It was a step short of a downgrade, which some had expected, but comes after two other ratings agencies have lowered their view of the country in the past month.
S&P Global maintained its investment-grade credit rating for France, a decision that Mr. Macron's government had eagerly awaited. But in restating a negative outlook first published in January, the ratings agency cited concern about France's ability to rein in its public finances amid already elevated general government debt.
And it added to concern among analysts about Mr. Macron's ability, in a tense social and political climate, to move forward with his efforts to lift the country's competitiveness and growth.
France's finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said in an interview late Friday published in the Journal du Dimanche that he viewed the announcement as a "positive signal," adding: "Our public finance strategy is clear. It is ambitious. And it is believable."
At the end of April, Fitch Ratings cut France's sovereign credit rating by one notch, to AA--, after a downgrade in December. Scope Ratings, a European agency, put a negative outlook on its assessment of France last month.
France's economy, the eurozone's second largest, is forecast to remain subdued until at least next year, but more worrisome to ratings agencies is the nation's financial situation. France spent vast sums to shield households and businesses from an inflation crisis and painful pandemic lockdowns.
Its debt has surged to 111 percent of economic output, casting France into a club with Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain -- the major eurozone economies holding the highest debt ratios. In Germany, which has Europe's largest economy and is its stickler for budget discipline, the debt burden is 66 percent of economic output.
S&P Global said it could lower France's ratings in the next 18 months if the debt did not decline, a risk that would be amplified if there was a prolonged economic slowdown or if France did not adequately curb government spending.
The potential for a downgrade had worried the government and was sensitive enough that Mr. Le Maire and France's prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, met recently with representatives of S&P to press their case. S&P had put France on notice in January that a downgrade was possible.
"There were detailed explanations from Bruno Le Maire to Standard & Poor's on everything we're doing to control our public finances," Ms. Borne told a French radio station last week. The finance minister "explained France's reforms and its objective of cutting the country's budget deficit," she said.
Mr. Le Maire has said stoking economic growth would be the best way to pay down the debt. But with the economy expected to grow just 0.8 percent this year, the government has pored through the budget to find offsetting cuts and limit growth in spending.
Ratings agencies have expressed concern that the potential political deadlock and social unrest pose risks to Mr. Macron's agenda. Nationwide demonstrations -- many of them violent -- broke out after he invoked executive power to bypass Parliament to ram through a measure that raised France's legal retirement age to 64 from 62, a change opposed by nearly three-quarters of voters in opinion polls.
Mr. Macron, who lost a parliamentary majority when he was re-elected in April, said the maneuver was necessary to keep the pension system from falling into a deficit and to generate 17 billion euros ( $ 18.2 billion) in savings in the coming years. Fitch and S&P Global gave it an approving nod as a moderately positive development.
But S&P Global cautioned that "political fragmentation" under Mr. Macron's watch had raised questions over his government's ability to carry out policies to stoke more growth and rein in the budget deficit.
His critics saw Mr. Macron's use of executive authority as an abuse of power and have vowed to keep up the fight over other measures that Mr. Macron plans to put forward. Opponents have continued to harass the president and his cabinet members by banging pots and pans on their official trips.
Mr. Macron has sought to show that he was quickly moving France back to business and trying to burnish its image after the turmoil. He hosted 200 global chief executives, including Elon Musk, Robert A. Iger of Disney and Lakshmi Mittal, the steel magnate, at Versailles last month for a business conference that drew pledges for €13 billion of new investment in France.
The moves are part of a plan by Mr. Macron, a former investment banker, to attract new investment and champion a push toward green industries to revitalize the French economy -- partly by spending lavishly on subsidies to attract foreign companies and keep French ones from moving jobs abroad.
Since taking office in 2017, Mr. Macron has cut business taxes and made it easier to hire and fire workers. New rules would push unemployed people to look for jobs, a controversial measure that would create over €4 billion in savings and theoretically help address a labor shortage. And for a fourth straight year in 2022, France was the European country that attracted the greatest number of foreign investments, according to a survey by EY, formerly Ernst & Young.
S&P Global said it expected labor market performance and the French economy overall to "continue to benefit from reforms implemented over the past decade."
But such developments haven't allayed concerns about France's ability to pay down the enormous expenses the government has racked up.
France's public debt soared after Mr. Macron spent nearly half a trillion euros shoring up the economy during the Covid pandemic. It is now nearly €3 trillion, and the cost of servicing the debt, which was low during the pandemic, has surged recently with inflation: About a tenth of all bonds issued by the French government are indexed to inflation, swelling the state's payment bill. Adding to the pressure is the run-up in interest rates by the European Central Bank.
All told, France's debt burden, or the amount of interest to be repaid, jumped to €42 billion in 2022 from $ 31 billion two years ago. The government expects that figure to rise to €60 billion by 2027 -- as much as the national education budget.
"A lot of money has been spent to help the economy, people and firms," said Charlotte de Montpellier, France analyst at ING Bank. "It worked when the economic situation was good, but public finances have been severely impacted."

Jenny Lewis didn’t mean to wind up with the marimba.
But for the last year, a vintage percussion instrument has occupied pride of place in the singer-songwriter’s forest green home studio. She inherited it from her godfather, Jerry Cohen, a music editor for TV and movies and an amateur musician, who died suddenly last spring. He was a surrogate dad to her, the kind who surreptitiously bought Hanukkah presents when money was tight in her household, and introduced her to jazz records when she was 10. She was the only person in the room with him when he passed away.
“He was my mentor and my best friend and the most Jewish of all people in my life,” she said. “Jerry would want me to get lessons on the marimba.”
Lewis, the 47-year-old indie artist whose country-rock troubadour style and evocative lyricism has earned her comparisons to songwriting greats from Nashville’s Music Row to Laurel Canyon, has suffered a lot of loss lately. Her mother’s death, in 2017, was the backdrop for her last album, “On the Line,” in 2019. Now, after losing Cohen and another mentor, the album designer and her “rock ’n’ roll dad” Gary Burden, there is “Joy’All,” an album out June 9 that grapples with aging, life cycles and romantic (im)possibility and yet somehow feels vivacious.
“My 40s are kicking my ass,” she sings on the third track over peppy acoustic guitars, “and handing them to me in a margarita glass.” The song is called “Puppy and a Truck,” her latest — and perhaps most lasting — prescription for happiness; she scored them both. “Having survived this moment, I felt like it was important to project something joyful,” she said.
The dog, Bobby Rhubarb, a shiny black cockapoo, greeted me with a waist-high leap when I visited Lewis recently at her home at the end of a wildflower-lined canyon road in the San Fernando Valley. The house is called Mint Chip — there’s an ice cream cone etched in stained glass by the garage — and Lewis acquired it after promising to maintain the whimsical touches that the Disney animator who built it in the 1950s installed. It attracts the fantastical too: during the pandemic, Lewis said, she discovered a baby squirrel had been sneaking in and hiding acorns under her pillow.
There is more than a little magic to her life. It’s in the way Lewis amplifies the space around her (she decked out that truck, a Chevy Colorado, with ersatz Gucci seat covers) and even the way she made it out of a career as a child actor to succeed in another artistic universe.
“She’s a unicorn,” said Soleil Moon Frye, her fellow child star (“Punky Brewster”) and a friend for decades. Even as a preteen, Lewis had musical skills, said Moon Frye, who documented their Hollywood crew’s adolescence in home movies, released as the 2021 documentary “Kid 90.” “We would memorize these hip-hop songs — she was always so good at rapping.”
Though she’s pegged as a country-tinged folk rock songwriter, Lewis’s keystone is still hip-hop, reggae, soul and funk — “finding the story in rap-style verses and picking up an acoustic guitar, and kind of marrying the two worlds,” she said. A printout of the Wikipedia entry for “3 Feet High and Rising,” the landmark album by De La Soul, rested on the music stand in her studio; she was paging through it to understand all the samples they had used.
Her references for “Joy’All” included Tracy Chapman, whose conversational delivery she admires, Portishead and Frank Ocean. About half of the tracks for the LP were created over two years in Los Angeles. The rest she made in Nashville, Tennessee, where she has also had a home since 2017. It’s her fifth studio album as a solo artist — she started out in popular indie bands Rilo Kiley and the Postal Service — and her first release on Blue Note Records, the storied jazz label. (After her own tour, she’ll be joining the Postal Service on the road this fall.)
Dave Cobb, the Nashville producer (Brandi Carlile, John Prine, Chris Stapleton) who worked on the album, was awestruck by her ease and perennial good moods. “If you don’t like Jenny Lewis, you don’t like people,” he said. Their sessions, tracking instruments like pedal steel and Mellotron, along with birdsong from Lewis’ Nashville backyard, flowed easily. “To say she led is absolute, because we all played to her,” he said, adding: “Everything she writes about is true. She literally showed up every day with the puppy and her truck.”
She has the openness of someone who has spent a lifetime cheerfully talking about herself, and the staggeringly eccentric stories of a showbiz veteran. Sitting on the midnight blue couch in her minimalist living room, Lewis, in a sweatshirt, sunset-hued corduroys and a single gold hoop earring inscribed with her last name, touched on being Jewish; the spiritual guru Ram Dass; the female Elvis impersonator who was her childhood babysitter; the time her mother convinced Lucille Ball to have a sitcom wrap party in their ramshackle house (“Lucy walks in, and she goes, ‘What a dump!’”); and the swap meet in Atlanta where she buys knockoff Gucci socks by the armful. “I would never buy a real Gucci sock — that’s so silly,” she said.
Telling stories about Cohen, she cried. When she was a child, he took her to his job on the Universal Studios lot and let her draw and animate her own movies using giant old film machines. Being with him when he died “was probably like the most important moment of my whole life,” she said.
Lewis’s parents, itinerant lounge musicians, split when she was a toddler. Her acting career in the ’80s changed the family’s fortunes, for a time, but her mother’s drug addiction and instability outpaced her sitcom earnings. She was estranged from her parents for decades, then reconciled with each late in their lives. Her father’s bass harmonica sits on a stand on her mantel.
“On my dad’s deathbed, he basically was like, ‘learn musical theory,’” she said. “So there has been this pressure, from my people, to do better and learn more.”
Jess Wolfe, one half of the duo Lucius, befriended Lewis and sings backup on “Joy’All.” “I really understand the need for trying to lift yourself up through your art and hoping that it can do the same for other people — she did that, in her cool, effortless Jenny Lewis kind of way,” Wolfe said.
“She’s always had to figure it out and take care of herself,” she added. “She is incredibly resourceful and incredibly clever about how to do something, effectively, efficiently and affordably. Truly, I’m always blown away by her in that sense — I will always feel creative when I’m around her.”
At age 40, after Lewis separated from her longtime partner, the musician Johnathan Rice, she moved to New York for the first time, realizing a teenage ambition. She lived in her pal Annie Clark’s (St. Vincent) apartment for two years, starting the side project NAF there with some friends. Then came Nashville, where she learned how to two-step at a honky-tonk across from the Ryman Auditorium.
In a rehearsal at a space covered in red velvet in Nashville last week, which she shared over a video call, Lewis directed her all-female backing band (she seeks out women for the stage and, for this outing, even has a female tour manager — a relative rarity in the industry, and a first for her). “You guys just pedal on that, and let me do my thing,” she said, as they prepared to sing “Acid Tongue,” the title track off her 2008 solo debut. “Let’s get those ‘oohs,’” she instructed. The harmonies rolled in. “Well done,” she told them. “It’s just feeling confident.”
Back in LA, Lewis had confided that aging as an unfiltered, undoctored music star isn’t easy. “I see myself and I don’t always love it,” she said. “But I’m trying to embrace being a woman in her 40s, and all that has to offer .”
She is contentedly single now, though trying out a dating app, and itching to write about it — even, she admitted, enjoying that more.
“My life is outrageous,” she said, although her songwriting is not straight autobiography. “But if I’m being honest, I’m in every single line.”

Zucker's Now On the Hunt For Investment Opportunities: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mr. Zucker is C.E.O. of a $ 1 billion investment venture backed by RedBird Capital Partners and International Media Investments, an Emirati firm.
Since leaving CNN a year ago, Jeff Zucker, the network's former president, has been on the hunt for deals, flush with $ 1 billion in backing from big investors in the worlds of media and finance.
RedBird Capital Partners, a private-equity firm, and International Media Investments, a funder with connections to the government of the United Arab Emirates, are betting that Mr. Zucker's record in the media industry will help him zero in on promising investments in digital media, sports, entertainment and news.
In addition to Mr. Zucker, the key players in the new venture, known as RedBird IMI, are Gerry Cardinale, the chief executive and founder of RedBird, and Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, an Emirati government minister who has spearheaded many of IMI's investment conversations in the United States. Mr. Cardinale is the chief investment officer of RedBird IMI, and Mr. Al Jaber is chairman.
RedBird is committing $ 250 million to the venture, and IMI has agreed to commit the remaining $ 750 million. The men gathered to discuss business last fall in a suite overlooking a Formula 1 racetrack in Abu Dhabi.
Since Mr. Zucker started his venture last year, dozens of suitors have made the pilgrimage to his offices on Madison Avenue near Central Park in Manhattan, including former CNN employees, agents and corporate development executives. In those meetings, he has held forth on the future of entertainment, sports and news, weighing in on various investment opportunities.
Mr. Zucker has described RedBird IMI as "Candle Media but half the price," referring to a company run by two former Disney executives, Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs. Candle Media has spent billions in cash and stock to buy and combine properties including Moonbug Entertainment, maker of the hit animated show "CoComelon," and Hello Sunshine, Reese Witherspoon's production company.
It remains to be seen whether Mr. Zucker's acumen as a TV producer and corporate operator will translate to success in private equity, where profits hinge on finding great assets and shrewd deal-making. But he is aided in those efforts by Mr. Cardinale, a Goldman Sachs veteran with decades of investment experience.
Mr. Zucker has already begun to scout deals. The venture has held discussions to invest in digital media start-ups including Puck and Semafor and has also met with the founders of Punchbowl News, the Capital Hill-focused media start-up that was launched in 2021.
In the months since Mr. Zucker started RedBird IMI, he has begun staffing up. One of his deputies at CNN, Rani Raad, the company's former president of CNN Commerical Worldwide, has joined the venture.
Mr. Zucker has also told confidants that, with RedBird IMI, he is interested in building a company that owns digital publications targeted at specific audiences, similar to Condé Nast, publisher of Vogue and The New Yorker.

Jeff Zucker Just Won't Let CNN Go Already: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The seminar was to be on media leadership. Dozens of students filling a classroom at Yale University in April were there to learn about the business from a man who had commanded attention in TV control rooms and corporate boardrooms for decades before a stunning exit last year.
What they got was remarkable candor about that exit.
Jeff Zucker, who had been president of CNN for nine years, told the group that he believed the network's former owners used his relationship with Allison Gollust -- who was also in attendance -- as a pretext for removing him, three people familiar with his comments said.
In front of the students -- where other high-profile media executives, including Bob Iger of Disney, were scheduled to speak the same day -- Mr. Zucker compared his failure to disclose his relationship with Ms. Gollust, CNN's former communications chief, to handing over a dangerous weapon.
"I gave them a gun, and they shot me with it," Mr. Zucker said, according to the people.
That Mr. Zucker would compare his forced departure to a gunshot wound underscores the depth of his frustration with his last days at a network he controlled with exacting detail for years.
The complaint wasn't unusual for Mr. Zucker, 58. He often compares notes on the media business with former colleagues and industry acquaintances, many of whom call him to grouse about the current state of CNN.
But his gripes have become more frequent of late, and he has made no secret of his unhappiness with the terms of his exit from CNN or his low regard for the performance of its current leader, Chris Licht. In a sense, he is now serving as a kind of grievance switchboard for current and former employees of the news network, many people who have spoken with him said.
Mr. Zucker's criticism may be painful for executives running CNN to hear second- and thirdhand. But also painful are the numbers: The news division, which once regularly made more than $ 1 billion in profit annually, generated just $ 750 million in profit last year. And its ratings were down more than 30 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with the same point in the 2020 presidential election cycle, when Donald J. Trump -- a major driver of cable news viewership -- was still in the White House, according to Nielsen data.
As it has geared up to cover the 2024 campaign, the network has committed some unforced errors. Last month, CNN hosted a town hall with Mr. Trump in New Hampshire that was criticized for airing false information. Mr. Licht's leadership and problems at the helm of the network were dissected at length in a 15,000-word Atlantic article that was published Friday.
Many anchors Mr. Zucker hired or promoted, including Jake Tapper, and Kaitlan Collins, who moderated the town hall, are still in prominent spots in CNN's lineup. But he has found himself banished from the control room during a major news cycle, including an indictment of former President Trump and the opening acts of the 2024 presidential election.
He has not been hiding away, though. He and Ms. Gollust traveled to Las Vegas to see a Taylor Swift concert, and last month he attended the Sports Emmy Awards at the invitation of Bryant Gumbel, along with the former "Today" anchor Matt Lauer. His new office in Manhattan -- where a life-size statue of the Incredible Hulk looms in the entryway -- is just blocks from CNN's former New York headquarters in Columbus Circle.
And he is trying to get his next act off the ground, starting a new venture called RedBird IMI with $ 1 billion to spend on acquisitions in the digital media, sports, entertainment and news industries.
This article on Mr. Zucker is based on interviews with more than four dozen of his associates in the media industry who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing their relationship with him. He declined to comment, but through a spokeswoman described his attitude toward CNN.
"It is wholly unsurprising that Jeff Zucker, the architect of CNN's unprecedented success, would have deep misgivings about the direction the network has taken since he left," said Risa Heller, a spokeswoman for Mr. Zucker. She added that it was also no surprise "that he gets asked a lot, publicly and privately, and regularly from former colleagues, about what he thinks of CNN now."
Months after he left CNN in February 2022, Mr. Zucker met with his successor, Mr. Licht. The organizers of that meeting -- industry confederates who know both men -- hoped that a lunch at Mr. Zucker's house on Amagansett's tony Hedges Lane would clear the air.
Mr. Zucker had been privately critical of Mr. Licht's leadership of CNN, according to people who have spoken with him, and the two men hadn't met since Mr. Zucker was pushed out.
The get-together didn't kindle much bonhomie between the media executives, who had been friendly in the clubby world of TV news. Mr. Licht was seeking a rapprochement. Mr. Zucker was asked to give advice. But afterward, the former CNN president griped that Mr. Licht didn't take any of his pointers, said a person familiar with his feelings following the meal.
"This is all very sad for Jeff," said Kenneth Lerer, the co-founder of HuffPost and former chairman of BuzzFeed. "He should move on with his life. It's disheartening to see."
Mr. Lerer has a distinct perspective on the situation: He is a close friend of David Zaslav, the chief executive of CNN owner Warner Bros. Discovery, and was once also friendly with Mr. Zucker.
Mr. Zucker's criticism has rankled executives of Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns CNN, according to people familiar with their thinking. They suspect Mr. Zucker has leaked unflattering information about the network's operations to the press.
He has also been candid about what he sees as the missteps of CNN's former parent company, AT&T, and its leaders, including the former WarnerMedia chief executive Jason Kilar, many industry acquaintances who have spoken with Mr. Zucker in recent months say.
Executives at Warner Bros. Discovery believe Mr. Zucker is waging a proxy war against Mr. Licht, undermining his leadership from afar, according to three people familiar with their thinking.
Mr. Zucker's criticisms have come at a particularly inopportune time for Warner Bros. Discovery, which was created last year from the fusion of WarnerMedia, CNN's parent company at the time, and Discovery, the home of "Dr. Pimple Popper" and "90 Day Fiancé" and is still trying to get CNN onto solid footing.
A spokesman for Warner Bros. Discovery said in a statement that the company was confident in the direction of the network and in Mr. Licht's leadership of it. "We set a high bar for ourselves and while we know that it will take time to complete the important work that's underway, we have great confidence in the progress that Chris and the team are making and share their conviction in the strategy," the statement said.
Underlying the grievances are tensions between Mr. Zucker and Mr. Zaslav, who picked Mr. Licht to succeed Mr. Zucker at the top of CNN. Once great friends and business allies -- and a regular pair at the East Hampton Golf Club -- the two men have grown apart since Mr. Zucker's ouster, people familiar with their relationship say.
In March, Mr. Zaslav visited CNN's Manhattan headquarters and criticized Mr. Zucker's leadership of the network in a meeting with Mr. Licht's lieutenants, according to someone at Warner Bros. Discovery. In the meeting, Mr. Zaslav told CNN executives that Mr. Zucker's gripes -- which had made their way to him -- were ironic, given that Mr. Zucker had once remarked that Mr. Licht was the one executive who could do the job if he ever left the network.
Since he took over CNN's parent company, Mr. Zaslav has fired back, telling employees in a private meeting that there was a "period of time" when it became an "advocacy network," a not-so-subtle dig at segments that were stridently critical of President Trump, who drove massive ratings. Mr. Zucker disagrees with that characterization, people who have spoken with him say, believing that on his watch the network's policy of calling out Mr. Trump's falsehoods led to journalistic and financial success.
In another gathering this spring, Mr. Zucker said that his departure from CNN was the hardest period in his life, adding that the episode made his bond with Ms. Gollust stronger, according to a person familiar with his remarks. He also said that the punishment he received didn't fit the crime.
When Mr. Zucker was forced out of CNN last year, he and the network's parent company negotiated over a statement designating his failure to disclose his relationship with Ms. Gollust as the reason for his exit. "I was required to disclose it when it began but I didn't. I was wrong," Mr. Zucker wrote in a memo to employees at the time.
According to two people familiar with Mr. Zucker's departure from CNN, a company investigation into his conduct by the law firm Cravath, Swaine and Moore found multiple violations of CNN's standards and practices, including taking part in advising former New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.
Ms. Heller, Mr. Zucker's spokeswoman, said Mr. Zucker did not advise Mr. Cuomo.
"As we have said numerous times, Mr. Zucker never advised Andrew Cuomo, directly or indirectly," she said. "He was asked to resign for one reason only, failure to disclose his relationship."
For Mr. Zucker, who has been in senior management ranks since his 20s, when he became executive producer of "Today," his abrupt exit from CNN represented a marked change of pace. He soon began to explore his options, gravitating to the familiar territories of sports and media. Years ago, Mr. Zucker told a writer for the Harvard Crimson, the campus newspaper he worked on as an undergraduate, that he hadn't taken a day off since finishing college.
Shortly after his ouster from CNN, Mr. Zucker began plotting his next move, meeting with advisers, former colleagues and industry stalwarts at upscale watering holes like the Core Club in New York and the Four Seasons in Los Angeles. But even as he planned for the future, Mr. Zucker was thinking about his past.
In the summer, he traveled to Jackson Hole, in Wyoming, for an off-the-record gathering of media executives. In a fireside chat at the event, he was asked for his view on the current direction of CNN and in his answer criticized Mr. Kilar for the way the executive handled his exit, according to two people familiar with his remarks.
In his new endeavor, the investment vehicle Redbird IMI, he has told confidants he is interested in building a company that owns digital publications targeted at specific audiences, similar to Condé Nast, publisher of Vogue and The New Yorker. He has held talks with owners of digital-media start-ups, but those conversations haven't yet resulted in a deal. He is now one of at least three suitors exploring a deal to take a majority stake in Air Mail, the media company founded by the former Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter.
In recent months, he has also met with Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, according to three people familiar with their conversation.
One company Mr. Zucker is not in talks to acquire is CNN, according to people familiar with his plans. Though he has told some associates he would be interested in acquiring the network should it come up for sale one day, he has lamented to others that CNN's current owners, Warner Bros. Discovery, have damaged the network so much through cost-cutting that he wouldn't be interested in owning it.
But Mr. Zucker has explored a deal for the network before. In late 2020, he and Andrew Morse, CNN's former digital chief, met with Emerson Collective, the umbrella company founded by Laurene Powell Jobs, and had preliminary conversations about a potential spinout of the network. Without informing Mr. Kilar, his boss at the time, Mr. Zucker referred Emerson Collective's interest to an executive at AT&T. The deal never happened, and AT&T ultimately turned to Discovery.
There are signs that Mr. Zucker believes he could once again be calling the shots at a media organization. He has told associates that he's open to an operational role at one of the companies he buys, and many of his confidantes believe he could still land another big corporate job.
A professional revival for Mr. Zucker has some precedent. After he was fired as chief executive of NBCUniversal in 2010, Mr. Zucker created a new daytime show for Disney with the former "Today" host Katie Couric that he called a "tremendous opportunity."
Then he got the CNN job. "Katie" was off the air two years later.

Full text: The directors of this sequel discuss their diverging influences, from Leonardo da Vinci to the movie "Say Anything."
In the 2018 animated hit "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Miles Morales, a Brooklyn teenage superhero in development, receives multiple unexpected visits from other dimensions. For the film's sequel, "Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse," it's Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore) who must follow Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld), a version of Spider-Woman, into new realms where other spider people exist.
For the films' directors, Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers and Justin K. Thompson, the premise, with Miles now as a traveler and not a host, granted them permission to expand their aesthetic horizons. This time the task wasn't limited to creating uniquely designed characters inhabiting a single universe, but entire worlds based on the myriad comic book sagas that have reinterpreted Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's arachnid paladin.
"It's almost like we're jumping from one book to another," Thompson said. "The goal was to take people on a journey and have a celebration of all these different amazing artists."
To do so, the production went to the source and contacted some of the people behind those alternate "Spider-Man" visions to participate in the development of the film. Rick Leonardi, who designed the comic "Spider-Man 2099," came on board to help devise 3-D animation tools that could emulate his line work. And Brian Stelfreeze, a seasoned artist for Marvel Comics, was instrumental in formulating the film's take on Jessica Drew/Spider-Woman.
Calling from different areas in Los Angeles -- a city that could be its own Spider-Verse -- for a video interview, the three filmmakers dissected some of the other ideas swirling in their reference pool.
Leonardo da Vinci and Royal de Luxe
Early in this multiverse adventure, a villain named Vulture unexpectedly enters Gwen's colorful world. Native to another reality, the monochromatic character wielding a variety of gadgets, who looks as if drawn on parchment paper, had to clearly and immediately feel foreign to the world he was invading. Sketches by the Renaissance artist and inventor Leonardo da Vinci served as a foundation for his design.
"Vulture's contraptions were like a hyper-realized version of a lot of the insane inventions that da Vinci himself had come up with, which, some of them were crazy, some of them were very forward thinking," Dos Santos said. "Some of them were frankly horrific."
Another crucial inspiration during the initial development of the character was the work of Royal de Luxe, a street theater company based in Nantes, France, that specializes in creating large-scale marionettes.
'Say Anything'
The only quiet alone time Miles and Gwen have in the entire film occurs as they both gaze at an inverted New York skyline. As breathtaking and significant as the sequence is, it went in and out of the movie on multiple occasions. "It had to really earn its way into the film," Powers said. Throughout the process, he found himself thinking of Cameron Crowe's innocent romance "Say Anything." The male lead in that film, Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack), tries to convince his love interest Diane Court (Ione Skye) to give their unlikely match a chance even though her father disapproves. "There's definitely a parallel there because Gwen has these mentor figures in her life who are urging her to stay away from Miles Morales for reasons that our audience will discover," Powers said. But, of course, having a swoon-worthy Cameron Crowe moment between two spider people with amazing abilities had to have an extraordinary setting, namely a clock tower while they both hang upside down.
'Cinderella'
Gwen's world functions like a mood ring that reacts to her emotions. For example, if she feels angry, the screen turns red and the atmosphere hotter. And when confusion overtakes her, the world becomes fragmented. According to Thompson, the 1950 animated Disney classic "Cinderella" served as a reference. "As a kid, I remember seeing the scene when Cinderella's dress is being torn apart by the evil stepsisters, and the backgrounds and the environment start reacting to this emotional trauma that she's going through," he said. For him, these moments in Gwen's reactive microcosm push the film into its most experiential form.
Jet Propulsion Laboratory
The production visited NASA's research and development center in La Cañada Flintridge, Calif., to research how cutting-edge technology could apply to the characters in their film. They hoped to figure out how Miguel O'Hara, a brilliant geneticist who becomes the Spider-Man of the year 2099, could create a tear-resistant, high-tech wingsuit with powerful flying capabilities, and what materials it would be made out of if it actually existed in our world.
To optimize the look of Spider-Byte, a spider person who fights crime in a cyberspace multiverse and appears translucid, the filmmakers explored current techniques that are right on the cusp of creating three-dimensional holograms in real time. "We aren't just putting her onscreen and then putting her at a slight opacity," Thompson said. "There are specific techniques that we delved deep into to give her a sense of presence onscreen that feels like she's beyond just somebody wearing a suit."
'Point Break' and 'No Country for Old Men'
For Powers, there were two high-water marks of great character development through an action sequence that bled into the retro-futuristic realm of Spider-Man 2099. One of them is the foot chase in Kathryn Bigelow's "Point Break" where Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) tries to catch Bodhi (Patrick Swayze). "It was bizarre and funny, and it implemented things that we'd learned about the characters early in the film, namely that Utah injured his knee playing football," Powers said. A similar chase unfolds in "Across the Spider-Verse."
The other reference at the front of Powers's mind was the Coen brothers' "No Country for Old Men." In that film, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) remains defiant in the face of the psychopathic hit man Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). Even if there's an inevitability to how it will all be resolved, Moss fights back and "gets his licks in," as Powers put it.
"Miles is being chased too," he added, "but we still want him to get his licks in."

Jeff Zucker’s View From Outside CNN: He Could Do Better

Full text: Enlarge this image.
The seminar was to be on media leadership. Dozens of students filling a classroom at Yale University in April were there to learn about the business from a man who had commanded attention in TV control rooms and corporate boardrooms for decades before a stunning exit last year.
What they got was remarkable candor about that exit.
Jeff Zucker, who had been president of CNN for nine years, told the group that he believed the network’s former owners used his relationship with Allison Gollust — who was also in attendance — as a pretext for removing him, three people familiar with his comments said.
In front of the students — where other high-profile media executives, including Bob Iger of Disney, were scheduled to speak the same day — Zucker compared his failure to disclose his relationship with Gollust, CNN’s former communications chief, with handing over a dangerous weapon.
“I gave them a gun, and they shot me with it,” Zucker said, according to the people.
That Zucker would compare his forced departure with a gunshot wound underscores the depth of his frustration with his last days at a network he controlled with exacting detail for years.
The complaint wasn’t unusual for Zucker, 58. He often compares notes on the media business with former colleagues and industry acquaintances, many of whom call him to discuss the current state of CNN.
But his gripes have become more frequent of late, and he has made no secret of his unhappiness with the terms of his exit from CNN or his low regard for the performance of its current leader, Chris Licht. In a sense, he is now serving as a kind of grievance switchboard for current and former employees of the news network, many people who have spoken with him said.
Zucker’s criticism may be painful for executives running CNN to hear secondhand and thirdhand. But also painful are the numbers: The news division, which once regularly made more than $1 billion in profit annually, generated $750 million in profit last year. And its ratings were down more than 30% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same point in the 2020 presidential election cycle, when Donald Trump — a major driver of cable news viewership — was still in the White House, according to Nielsen data.
Many anchors Zucker hired or promoted, including Kaitlan Collins, are in prominent spots in CNN’s lineup, but he has found himself banished from the control room during a major news cycle, including an indictment of Trump and the opening acts of the 2024 presidential election.
He has not been hiding away, though. He and Gollust traveled to Las Vegas for a Taylor Swift concert, and last month he attended the Sports Emmy Awards at the invitation of Bryant Gumbel, along with former “Today” anchor Matt Lauer. His new office in midtown Manhattan — where a life-size statue of the Incredible Hulk looms in the entryway — is just blocks from CNN’s former New York headquarters in Columbus Circle.
And he is trying to get his next act off the ground: starting a new venture called RedBird IMI with $1 billion to spend on acquisitions in the digital media, sports, entertainment and news industries.
This article on Zucker is based on interviews with more than four dozen of his associates in the media industry who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing their relationship with him. He declined to comment, but through a spokesperson described his attitude toward CNN.
“It is wholly unsurprising that Jeff Zucker, the architect of CNN’s unprecedented success, would have deep misgivings about the direction the network has taken since he left,” said Risa Heller, a spokesperson for Zucker. She added that it was also no surprise “that he gets asked a lot, publicly and privately and regularly, from former colleagues about what he thinks of CNN now.”
Months after he left CNN in February 2022, Zucker met with his successor, Licht. The organizers of that meeting — industry confederates who know both men — hoped that a lunch at Zucker’s house on Long Island would clear the air.
Zucker had been privately critical of Licht’s leadership of CNN, according to people who have spoken with him, and the two men hadn’t met since Zucker was pushed out.
The get-together didn’t kindle much bonhomie between the media executives, who had been friendly in the clubby world of TV news. Licht was seeking a rapprochement. Zucker was asked to give advice. But afterward, the former CNN president griped that Licht didn’t take any of his pointers, said a person familiar with his feelings following the meal.
“This is all very sad for Jeff,” said Kenneth Lerer, the co-founder of HuffPost and former chair of BuzzFeed. “He should move on with his life. It’s disheartening to see.”
Lerer has a distinct perspective on the situation: He is a close friend of David Zaslav, the CEO of CNN owner Warner Bros. Discovery, and was once also friendly with Zucker.
Zucker’s criticism has rankled executives of Warner Bros. Discovery, according to people familiar with their thinking. They suspect Zucker has leaked unflattering information about the network’s operations to the press.
He has also been candid about what he sees as the missteps of CNN’s former parent company, AT&T, and its leaders, including former WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar, many industry acquaintances who have spoken with Zucker in recent months say.
Executives at Warner Bros. Discovery believe Zucker is waging a proxy war against Licht, undermining his leadership from afar, according to three people familiar with their thinking.
Zucker’s criticisms have come at a particularly inopportune time for Warner Bros. Discovery, which was created last year from the fusion of WarnerMedia, CNN’s parent company at the time, and Discovery, the home of “Dr. Pimple Popper” and “90 Day Fiancé” and is still trying to get CNN onto solid footing.
Underlying the grievances are tensions between Zucker and Zaslav, who picked Licht to succeed Zucker at the top of CNN. Once great friends and business allies — and a regular twosome at the East Hampton Golf Club in East Hampton, New York — the two men have grown apart since Zucker’s ouster, people familiar with their relationship say.
In March, Zaslav visited CNN’s Manhattan headquarters and criticized Zucker’s leadership of the network in a meeting with Licht’s lieutenants, according to someone at Warner Bros. Discovery. In the meeting, Zaslav told CNN executives that Zucker’s gripes — which had made their way to him — were ironic, given that Zucker had once remarked that Licht was the one executive who could do the job if he ever left the network.
Since he took over CNN’s parent company, Zaslav has fired back, telling employees in a private meeting that there was a “period of time” when it became an “advocacy network,” a not-so-subtle dig at segments that were stridently critical of Trump, who drove massive ratings. Zucker disagrees with that characterization, people who have spoken with him say, believing that on his watch, the network’s policy of calling out Trump’s falsehoods led to journalistic and financial success.
In another gathering this spring, Zucker said that his departure from CNN was the hardest period in his life, adding that the episode made his bond with Gollust stronger, according to a person familiar with his remarks. He also said that the punishment he received didn’t fit the crime.
When Zucker was forced out of CNN last year, he and the network’s parent company negotiated over a statement designating his failure to disclose his relationship with Gollust as the reason for his exit. “I was required to disclose it when it began but I didn’t. I was wrong,” Zucker wrote in a memo to employees at the time.
According to two people familiar with Zucker’s departure from CNN, a company investigation into his conduct by the law firm Cravath, Swaine and Moore found multiple violations of CNN’s standards and practices, including taking part in advising former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
Heller, Zucker’s spokesperson, said Zucker did not advise Cuomo.
“As we have said numerous times, Mr. Zucker never advised Andrew Cuomo, directly or indirectly,” she said. “He was asked to resign for one reason only, failure to disclose his relationship.”
For Zucker, who has been in senior management ranks since his 20s, when he became executive producer of “Today,” his abrupt exit from CNN represented a marked change of pace. He soon began to explore his options, gravitating to the familiar territories of sports and media. Years ago, Zucker told a writer for the Harvard Crimson, the campus newspaper he worked on as an undergraduate, that he hadn’t taken a day off since finishing college.
Shortly after his ouster from CNN, Zucker began plotting his next move, meeting with advisers, former colleagues and industry stalwarts at upscale watering holes like the Core Club in New York and the Four Seasons in Los Angeles.

Full text: This charming sequel to the 2018 animated movie expands the multiverse concept, without shamelessly capitalizing on fan service.
Question: How many Spider-Men does it take to make a successful multiverse sequel?
I'm not certain, but it might be the countless number of Spideys that appear in the delightful "Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse."
A follow-up to the appropriately lauded "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," this animated movie takes place a year after the Brooklyn teen and newly minted Spider-Man, Miles Morales (voiced again by Shameik Moore), was bitten by a radioactive spider. In "Into the Spider-Verse," from 2018, Miles learned how to be his city's friendly neighborhood Spider-Man with the help of five other Spider-heroes -- all different Spidey incarnations transported from their original universes after a super collider explosion tore through the multiverse. Now Miles is 15, and though he has a handle on his powers, he's struggling to balance academics with his extracurricular hero work, on top of the usual adolescent woes.
As Miles's parents get increasingly suspicious about their son's double life, he has to fend off the pesky villain Spot (Jason Schwartzman, as the perfect goober), who powers up into a "transdimensional super-being" who poses a real threat to the multiverse.
In her separate universe Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld), a.k.a. Spider-Woman, Miles's pal and quasi-romantic interest from the first film, joins a task force of multiverse-jumping heroes called the Spider Society. They chase anomalies stuck in the wrong world in missions led by the brooding Spider-Man 2099, Miguel O'Hara (Oscar Isaac). But once Gwen and Miles reunite, and Miles discovers the Spider Society, he finds out he might actually be the real threat to the Spider-Verse.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"Spider-Verse" achieves the challenging task of building a sequel that not only replicates the charms of the first film but also expands the multiverse concept, the main characters and the stakes, without overinflating the premise or shamelessly capitalizing on fan service. In other words, "Across the Spider-Verse" pulls off a "Spider-Man: No Way Home," the Tom Holland vehicle that also played with alternate versions of Spider-Man, better than "No Way Home" did. That includes its inclusion of clips and cameos from former animated and live-action Spider-Man media, which nicely cohere with the rest of the film.
The Spider Society, with its delightfully bizarre potpourri of spider-entities (i.e., a Spider-Cowboy, Spider-Cat, Spider-Baby and Spider-Dinosaur), offers many opportunities for the movie to show off a compelling blend of visual gags, palettes and animation styles. The eye-catching action sequences among the Spider-folk serve the delectable chaos of a meme (yes, that pointing meme) exploded in a big-screen format.
Each Spidey we encounter, even briefly, is fully realized, and a welcome addition to the story, even for those who might not pick up on the deep-cut references to the '80s and '90s comics. Pavitr Prabhakar (Karan Soni), a.k.a. Spider-Man India, is designed with nods to contemporary Indian fashion. Spider-Punk (Daniel Kaluuya), a contrarian cool-guy rocker with combat boots, piercings and a devil-may-care attitude, is drawn in the wild 2-D-collage style of album covers, concert fliers and zines from the '80s London punk scene. And the way they move -- Pavitr's fluid web-slinging, Spider-Punk's stomps and thrashing and Gwen's graceful acrobatics and en pointe landings -- express as much about the characters as the buoyant dialogue and highly stylized character designs.
That's not even counting the work of the impressive voice cast. Issa Rae brings an affable tough-love vibe to her pregnant, kinky-haired, motorcycle-riding Spider-Woman Jessica Drew. And Isaac, who brings as an exacting a performance as he did in the Disney+ series "Moon Knight," is well-cast as the slightly unhinged and self-serious Spider-Man, à la the Dark Knight.
Steinfeld's Gwen, a fan fave, thankfully gets more spotlight in this film, which delves deeper into her tragic back story and her feelings of displacement in her world, particularly in her own home. She gets a driving pop-punk theme -- part of a killer soundtrack raging with rock, hip-hop and reggaeton -- and a stunning color-streaked aesthetic, with soft pinks and lavenders and heavy brushstrokes, creating an almost immersive comic book experience.
The directing team, Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers and Justin K. Thompson, builds a beautifully realistic, multicultural New York through details: a wheelchair basketball game in full swing on a nearby court, or a shelf of beef patties displayed in a Jamaican bodega.
Both "Spider-Verse" films, in what will be a trilogy, create dimension in these kinds of details, and I don't just mean the animation. (Though, to be fair, the infinite reach of the city skyline, as viewed upside down from Gwen and Miles's purview, is a satisfying visual callback to the first film and its own illustrative feat.) The dimension is in the thrust of the story itself.
This isn't just another multiverse slogfest but a bildungsroman. Because what else is adolescence but a confrontation with the various possibilities in life, the infinite selves you can be? It's about figuring out one's identity -- superhero or otherwise -- and finding a place to belong. The fact that Miles and Gwen also shoot webs and swing around skyscrapers is incidental to their emotional arcs in the film.
"Spider-Verse" also asks intriguing questions about the limitations of the canon, and whether tragedy is a prerequisite for a Spider-Man origin story -- the death of an Uncle Ben or Aunt May or Uncle Aaron. And whether trauma completely defines these heroes -- and, if so, if they can find kinship in that.
The most disappointing part of "Spider-Verse" is the merciless cliffhanger of an ending, ushering the film into a tradition of two-parters with too much story and too little time to tell it. But "Across the Spider-Verse" is never dull, nor precious with its characters and comedy. Which I suppose just proves that when it comes to a Spidey census, two's a team, three's a party and hundreds is a multiverse crawling with opportunities.
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse
Rated PG. Running time: 2 hours 20 minutes. In theaters.
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Rated PG for ferocious web-slinging and spider-trauma. Running time: 2 hours 20 minutes. In theaters.

Full text: Just a few days ago it looked as if G.O.P. extremism might set off a global financial crisis. The U.S. debt ceiling -- which allows Congress to determine spending and revenue, then refuse to permit borrowing to cover the difference -- seemed to give Republicans, who control the House, access to a financial doomsday machine: By refusing to raise the debt limit they could provoke a U.S. default that, given the key role played by U.S. debt in the world financial system, could have been catastrophic.
That doomsday machine, in turn, seemed to give Republicans far more power than a party narrowly controlling one house of Congress should possess. Would they use that power to demolish President Biden's accomplishments?
In fact, they barely scratched Biden's paint. And the mystery is why.
Like many -- I think most -- observers, I didn't see this coming. In the spring Republicans seemed to be converging on demands for harsh spending cuts, especially to Medicaid. The Biden administration was counting on self-proclaimed centrists and business groups to lean on Republicans to back off; they didn't. And publicly at least, Biden officials repeatedly rejected all possible end runs around the debt ceiling. Republicans seemed to be in a strong bargaining position.
Yet in the end we got some spending caps that would probably have happened even without the attempt to take the economy hostage, since "discretionary" spending would have had to pass the House in any case. We got an extension of work requirements in the food stamp program for Americans in their 50s, which will cause some loss of coverage -- not because they refuse to work, but because they'll be stymied by extra red tape.
And we got a side agreement to cut $ 20 billion from the $ 80 billion in additional funding for the I.R.S. that was included in the Inflation Reduction Act. But that $ 80 billion was for a decade. In practice, efforts to crack down on wealthy tax evaders will probably be little changed in the next few years, and the I.R.S. will simply come back for more money later.
Overall, the administration made hardly any major concessions; this debt standoff ended up being far less consequential than the debt ceiling crisis of 2011.
So how did Biden, whom right-wingers constantly deride as senile and incompetent despite a series of remarkable legislative achievements, pull this off?
Eventually we may get a blow-by-blow account of how the debt negotiations went down. Until then, it's worth noting several broader trends in the political environment that probably strengthened Biden's hand.
First, Democrats are no longer intimidated by deficit scolds. Back in 2011, the Obama administration seemed eager to win approval from a Beltway establishment dominated by Very Serious People who insisted that debt and deficits -- as opposed to, say, persistent high unemployment -- were the most crucial issue facing the nation. President Barack Obama came very close to agreeing to a bargain that would have raised the age of Medicare eligibility.
These days Democrats don't seem to care much about the deficit scolds; they'll probably care even less given the craven behavior of prominent groups during the debt confrontation.
Second, Republicans don't actually care about the budget deficit. Arguably they never did. But a dozen years ago many in the media and the political establishment took their fiscal posturing at face value. These days their true lack of concern is out in the open, so it's hard to find a commentator who seriously believes that a party seeking to prevent a crackdown on tax evasion cares about debt.
Third, the Republican Party has largely backed off on its push to drastically shrink government. We've come a long way from 2005, when President George W. Bush tried to privatize Social Security. These days even hard-right budget proposals tend to exempt Social Security and Medicare, and I believe that Republicans are beginning to realize that Medicaid has also become an extremely popular program.
Coming next: The realization that even white, rural, very MAGA areas like, say, Kentucky's Fifth Congressional District have become deeply dependent on food stamps.
Indeed, it's hard to avoid the sense that the G.O.P. has, in general, lost interest in fiscal policy. Apparatchiks at right-wing think tanks still inveigh against the evils of big government, and the donor class is as opposed as ever to paying taxes. But all the real passion on the right now seems to revolve around social issues like ending abortion rights and expunging any mention of racism from history classes.
In a way it's kind of funny. Critics of Democratic politics used to berate activists for focusing on social issues while allowing Republicans to dictate the economic agenda. Now Republicans are waging war on the Disney corporation while the Biden administration establishes large-scale industrial policy to fight climate change.
So what happened on the debt negotiations? Maybe it came down to this: Kevin McCarthy wasn't willing to blow up the economy to extract policy concessions because he's the leader of a party that no longer cares about policy.

His Football Card Didn't Get in the Way: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When Troy and Tommi Vincent made the jump from marathon phone calls to exchanging photos, there was one problem: The Miami Dolphins football card he sent her "wasn't personal enough."
After reconnecting via long-distance phone calls in the early 1990s, Tommi Vincent and Troy Vincent Sr., who had met a few years earlier in Trenton, N.J., decided it was time to exchange photos of each other through the mail.
At the time, Mr. Vincent was a 22-year-old cornerback for the Miami Dolphins.
"I sent her a football card because that's the only picture I had of myself," said Mr. Vincent, 52, now the N.F.L.'s executive vice president for football operations. "Back then you couldn't FaceTime."
Ms. Vincent, a life coach and chef who back then was an 18-year-old college student at Temple University, wasn't immediately impressed by the gesture.
"That wasn't personal enough for me," she said.
The pair continued their daily phone calls for months, however. And after a few visits, a promise ring and an engagement, they married in 1994. Five children and six grandchildren later, they recalled the moment they knew.
This interview has been lightly edited and condensed.
How did you two meet?
Troy Vincent Sr.: I was in high school, Tommi was in middle school. Tommi's older sister was dating my best friend and that's how I met the family.
Tommi Vincent: We weren't dating back then, just to be clear. There's a four-year age difference, so at that time, I met Troy hanging out with my sister and her friends, and I didn't think they were cool at all. And then, fast-forward, my sister ended up marrying the gentleman, and they were visiting Troy, and he inquired about me.
Troy: They were on a Disney cruise coming through the state of Florida, where I was living. I said, "Show me a picture."
You called her first after that?
Troy: Talk about running somebody down. It was like she didn't even want to talk to me. So not only did I call her first, I would not stop calling.
Tommi: Troy is an old soul, God bless him, and his first phone call to me was at 6 a.m. I was out partying until 4:30 in the morning. So when he first called, I'm like, "What?"
Troy: She picked up eventually, though.
Tommi: I did have a perception of him because he was a professional athlete. In my mind I was like: He probably a dog. So I had my college roommate at the time screening the calls. The one time that I did pick up, it was raining and my girlfriend wasn't there. And on that phone call we stayed on the phone from 3 in the afternoon until the next morning.
So you exchanged photos of yourselves after a few phone calls. How did she get the football card?
Troy: I mailed it, right?
Tommi: You had Linda mail it -- his godmom. Like she was his assistant.
Troy: It was literally a football card in an envelope with a 25-cent stamp.
By 2023 standards, that feels like a lot of effort.
Tommi: At this point, I had already caught feelings for him, so I when I got the card I was extremely annoyed, because I didn't feel what you're calling "effort." I was like: You're going to send me a football card, and I'm sending you a picture?
Troy: I didn't know if she still looked like the picture that I saw, because it was an old picture. But it didn't matter because at that time, I fell in love with the person who I was on the phone with every day.
When did you both meet in person?
Troy: Maybe about five or six months later. I was up in Jersey and I said, "Let's go out to dinner."
Tommi: Troy was playing the Jets, and he was like, "Hey, why don't you come out to the game?" All I had was the football card, so in my mind I'm like: I don't even think I'm going to know who this is when I see him. He walked into the hotel and we saw each other and smiled. And then, a couple of days later, he got me an airline ticket to come fly out to Florida to spend a couple of days with him.
Was there a moment during your phone calls that you knew this was the person for you?
Troy: None in particular. I think just over time. Outside of my line of work, I was not spending much time with another individual. I'm getting up on the phone, we're talking. On my breaks, we're talking. Going to sleep, we're talking. It was like, she like my homie. I'm now sharing with her everything about my life, and it was just what the doctor ordered.
Tommi: I would say about three months into our relationship -- and I hadn't shared it with anybody -- but I had this feeling inside of me that was indescribable. I just knew that I wanted him to be my husband, but I felt like I would sound like a fool if I had expressed that three months into our relationship. We continued to build on the relationship and experiencing intimacy over the phone, which really allowed us to get to know each other in ways beyond.

DeSantis Takes Pokes at Trump, But Cautiously: [National Desk]

Full text: After absorbing months of attacks from the former president, the Florida governor is beginning to fire back -- but carefully.
Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida came to Iowa for his first trip as a presidential candidate and made plain that he was done being Donald J. Trump's punching bag.
After absorbing months of attacks from Mr. Trump that went mostly unanswered, Mr. DeSantis has borrowed one of his rival's favorite lines -- "I'm going to counterpunch" -- and jabbed back.
He called one of the spending bills that Mr. Trump signed "grotesque" and accused him of increasing the national debt. He said the way Mr. Trump had sided with Disney in Mr. DeSantis's war with the entertainment giant was "bizarre." He described Mr. Trump's criticism of the governor's handling of Covid as "ridiculous." And he dared Mr. Trump to take a position on the debt-limit bill pending in Washington.
"Are you leading from the front?" Mr. DeSantis said, almost teasingly. "Or are you waiting for polls to tell you what position to take?"
A tricky balancing act lies ahead for Mr. DeSantis. All of those comments came not onstage in his first campaign speech before hundreds of Republicans at an evangelical church, but during a 15-minute news conference with reporters afterward. He did not mention Mr. Trump by name when he spoke directly to voters in each of his first four Iowa stops, though he has drawn implicit contrasts.
The two-pronged approach reflects the remarkable degree to which his pathway to the nomination depends on his ability to win over -- and not alienate -- the significant bloc of Republican voters who still like Mr. Trump even if they are willing to consider an alternative.
"I don't like to see them battle and do smear campaigns," said Jay Schelhaas, 55, a professor of nursing who came to see Mr. DeSantis on Wednesday in Pella, Iowa. An evangelical voter, he said he was undecided on whom to support in 2024 after backing Mr. Trump in his two past presidential runs.
Some themes have emerged in Mr. DeSantis's early broadsides. He has sought to question Mr. Trump's commitment to conservatism ("I do think, unfortunately, he's decided to move left on some of these issues"); his ability to execute his agenda ("I've been listening to these politicians talking about securing the border for years and years and years"); and his ability to win the 2024 general election ("There are a lot of voters that just aren't going to ever vote for him").
It was no coincidence that Mr. Trump arrived in Iowa on Mr. DeSantis's heels on Wednesday, in a sign of the intensifying political skirmish between the leading Republican presidential contenders and the centrality of Iowa in their paths to the nomination. Mr. Trump holds an advantage of roughly 30 percentage points in early national polls of the Republican primary.
In a statement, Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, said that Mr. DeSantis's first speech was "crafted to appease establishment Never Trumpers who are looking for a swamp puppet that will do their bidding."
Mr. DeSantis is seeking a challenging middle ground as he begins this new, more confrontational phase. He is trying to show voters that he is the kind of fighter who will not back down -- even against his party's dominant figure. At the same time, he must avoid being seen as overly focused on Republican infighting.
"I'm going to focus my fire on Biden," Mr. DeSantis said at his kickoff speech on Tuesday night in Clive, a suburb of Des Moines, even as he stepped up his attacks on Mr. Trump. "And I think he should do the same."
Advisers to Mr. DeSantis said his more assertive posture stemmed largely from the fact that he is now an actual candidate. But it is a notable shift. At a recent dinner with donors in Tallahassee, Fla., Mr. DeSantis was asked when he would start slugging Mr. Trump, and he suggested he would not be doing so immediately, according to an attendee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private conversation.
For the third time in Mr. DeSantis's three trips to Iowa this year, Mr. Trump planned to follow close behind with a two-day swing of his own. In March, when Mr. DeSantis came for his book tour, Mr. Trump arrived days later in the same city and drew a bigger crowd. In mid-May, Mr. Trump had scheduled a rally to stomp on the Florida governor's trip, though he canceled at the last minute, saying it was because of the weather. It was Mr. DeSantis who one-upped him then, appearing at a barbecue joint nearby.
"The weather was so nice that we felt we just had to come," Mr. DeSantis said to laughs in Clive.
Mr. Trump is doing a local television interview on Wednesday, and on Thursday he will host a lunch with religious leaders in Des Moines after attending a breakfast with a local Republican group. He is also holding a Fox News town hall event moderated by Sean Hannity.
Mr. Trump has been far from subtle in his attacks on Mr. DeSantis, calling him "Ron DeSanctimonious," denouncing his leadership of Florida and lashing him from the left for past proposals to trim Social Security and Medicare spending. No matter how much mud Mr. Trump slings, Republican voters have tended not to punish him, a double standard that has long worked to his advantage.
"I guess he's got to respond in some way," Tim Hamer, a retired Iowan who worked in banking and owned a lavender farm, said of Mr. DeSantis. Mr. Hamer, who was at the governor's event in Council Bluffs on Wednesday, said he had voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 and 2020 but was now leaning toward Mr. DeSantis.
"The point is," he added, "don't descend to Trump's level."
Among the issues over which Mr. DeSantis has explicitly broken with Mr. Trump is the legislation the former president signed that allows a pathway for nonviolent offenders to shrink their prison time. Last week, Mr. DeSantis called the measure "a jailbreak bill."
In stop after stop, Mr. DeSantis has also pointed to his ability to serve as president for two terms, unlike Mr. Trump, saying that the next president could appoint as many as four Supreme Court justices.
He said on Tuesday, "I don't need someone to give me a list to know what a conservative justice looks like." Mr. Trump -- whose appointment of the justices who tilted the Supreme Court rightward and overturned Roe v. Wade cheered conservatives -- promised in the 2016 campaign to pick a justice from a list that was created by conservative judicial activists, and he has promised to release another list ahead of 2024.
Regina Hansen, who attended the DeSantis event in Council Bluffs, said she wished Mr. Trump and Mr. DeSantis would patch up their once-friendly relationship. But in the meantime, she said, she thought the best way for Mr. DeSantis to win over Trump supporters was to keep talking about himself, his record and his family.
"I have a very positive opinion of him, more so now than I did before I came here today," Ms. Hansen said after hearing Mr. DeSantis speak.
But Will Schademann, who came to the rally with a copy of Mr. DeSantis's recent book, said he believed the governor needed to stay on the attack against the former president.
"I just think it's the right approach," said Mr. Schademann, who added he voted twice for Mr. Trump. "He needs to contrast what he did with what Trump did."
At his stops on Wednesday in Council Bluffs, Salix and Pella, Iowa, Mr. DeSantis directed his verbal assaults at President Biden and kept his swipes at Mr. Trump more oblique.
"Our great American comeback tour starts by sending Joe Biden back to his basement in Delaware," he said in Council Bluffs.
In contrast, Mr. DeSantis criticized Mr. Trump, a former reality television star, indirectly though pointedly.
"The Bible makes very clear that God frowns upon pride and looks to people who have humility," he said.
In recent days, Mr. DeSantis has seemed especially eager to discuss his handling of the coronavirus, which vaulted him to national prominence. Mr. Trump recently unfavorably compared the governor's handling of the pandemic to that of former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, Democrat of New York.
Mr. DeSantis has expressed shock at this line of attack, arguing that closures and isolation measures instituted early in the pandemic did more harm than help.
"The former president would double down on his lockdowns from March of 2020," Mr. DeSantis said.
"Do you want Cuomo or do you want free Florida?" he added. "If we just decided the caucuses on that, I would be happy with that verdict by Iowa voters."

PELLA, Iowa — Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida came to Iowa for his first trip as a presidential candidate and made plain that he was done being Donald Trump’s punching bag.

In mid-May, Trump had scheduled a rally to stomp on the Florida governor’s trip, though he canceled at the last minute, saying it was because of the weather. It was DeSantis who one-upped him then, appearing at a barbecue joint nearby.
“The weather was so nice that we felt we just had to come,” DeSantis said to laughs in Clive.
Trump is doing a local television interview Wednesday, and Thursday he will host a lunch with religious leaders in Des Moines after attending a breakfast with a local Republican group. He is also holding a Fox News town hall event moderated by Sean Hannity.
Trump has been far from subtle in his attacks on DeSantis, calling him “Ron DeSanctimonious,” denouncing his leadership of Florida and lashing him from the left for past proposals to trim Social Security and Medicare spending. No matter how much mud Trump slings, Republican voters have tended not to punish him, a double standard that has long worked to his advantage.
“I guess he’s got to respond in some way,” Tim Hamer, a retired Iowan who worked in banking and owned a lavender farm, said of DeSantis. Hamer, who was at the governor’s event in Council Bluffs on Wednesday, said he had voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020 but was now leaning toward DeSantis
“The point is,” he added, “don’t descend to Trump’s level.”
Among the issues over which DeSantis has explicitly broken with Trump is the legislation the former president signed that allows a pathway for nonviolent offenders to shrink their prison time. Last week, DeSantis called the measure “a jailbreak bill.”
In stop after stop, DeSantis has also pointed to his ability to serve as president for two terms, unlike Trump, saying that the next president could appoint as many as four Supreme Court justices.
He said Tuesday, “I don’t need someone to give me a list to know what a conservative justice looks like.” Trump — whose appointment of the justices who tilted the Supreme Court rightward and overturned Roe v. Wade cheered conservatives — promised in the 2016 campaign to pick a justice from a list that was created by conservative judicial activists, and he has promised to release another list before 2024.
Regina Hansen, who attended the DeSantis event in Council Bluffs, said she wished Trump and DeSantis would patch up their once-friendly relationship. But in the meantime, she said, she thought the best way for DeSantis to win over Trump supporters was to keep talking about himself, his record and his family.
“I have a very positive opinion of him, more so now than I did before I came here today,” Hansen said after hearing DeSantis speak.
But Will Schademann, who came to the rally with a copy of DeSantis’ recent book, said he believed the governor needed to stay on the attack against the former president.
“I just think it’s the right approach,” said Schademann, who added he voted twice for Trump. “He needs to contrast what he did with what Trump did.”
At his stops Wednesday in Council Bluffs, Pella and Salix, Iowa, DeSantis directed his verbal assaults at President Joe Biden and kept his swipes at Trump more oblique.
“Our great American comeback tour starts by sending Joe Biden back to his basement in Delaware,” he said in Council Bluffs.
In contrast, DeSantis criticized Trump, a former reality television star, indirectly though pointedly.
“The Bible makes very clear that God frowns upon pride and looks to people who have humility,” he said.
In recent days, DeSantis has seemed especially eager to discuss his handling of the coronavirus, which vaulted him to national prominence. Trump recently unfavorably compared the Florida governor’s handling of the pandemic to that of former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat.
DeSantis has expressed shock at this line of attack, arguing that closures and isolation measures instituted early in the pandemic did more harm than help.
“The former president would double down on his lockdowns from March of 2020,” DeSantis said.
“Do you want Cuomo or do you want free Florida?” he added. “If we just decided the caucuses on that, I would be happy with that verdict by Iowa voters.”

PELLA, Iowa — Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida came to Iowa for his first trip as a presidential candidate and made plain that he was done being Donald Trump’s punching bag.
After absorbing months of attacks from Trump that went mostly unanswered, DeSantis has borrowed one of his rival’s favorite lines — “I’m going to counterpunch” — and jabbed back.
He called one of the spending bills that Trump signed “grotesque” and accused him of increasing the national debt. He said the way Trump had sided with The Walt Disney Co. in DeSantis’ war with the entertainment giant was “bizarre.” He described Trump’s criticism of the governor’s handling of COVID as “ridiculous.” And he dared Trump to take a position on the debt-limit bill pending in Washington.
“Are you leading from the front?” DeSantis said, almost teasingly. “Or are you waiting for polls to tell you what position to take?”
A tricky balancing act lies ahead for DeSantis. All of those comments came not onstage in his first campaign speech before hundreds of Republicans at an evangelical church, but during a 15-minute news conference with reporters afterward. He did not mention Trump by name when he spoke directly to voters in each of his first four Iowa stops, although he has drawn implicit contrasts.
The two-pronged approach reflects the remarkable degree to which his pathway to the nomination depends on his ability to win over — and not alienate — the significant bloc of Republican voters who still like Trump even if they are willing to consider an alternative.
“I don’t like to see them battle and do smear campaigns,” said Jay Schelhaas, 55, a professor of nursing who came to see DeSantis on Wednesday in Pella, Iowa. An evangelical voter, he said he was undecided on whom to support in 2024 after backing Trump in his two past presidential runs.
Some themes have emerged in DeSantis’ early broadsides. He has sought to question Trump’s commitment to conservatism (“I do think, unfortunately, he’s decided to move left on some of these issues”); his ability to execute his agenda (“I’ve been listening to these politicians talking about securing the border for years and years and years”); and his ability to win the 2024 general election (“There are a lot of voters that just aren’t going to ever vote for him”).
It was no coincidence that Trump arrived in Iowa on DeSantis’ heels Wednesday, in a sign of the intensifying political skirmish between the leading Republican presidential contenders and the centrality of Iowa in their paths to the nomination. Trump holds an advantage of roughly 30 percentage points in early national polls of the Republican primary.
In a statement, Steven Cheung, a spokesperson for Trump, said that DeSantis’ first speech was “crafted to appease establishment Never Trumpers who are looking for a swamp puppet that will do their bidding.”
DeSantis is seeking a challenging middle ground as he begins this new, more confrontational phase. He is trying to show voters that he is the kind of fighter who will never back down — even against his party’s dominant figure. At the same time, he must avoid being seen as overly focused on Republican infighting.
“I’m going to focus my fire on Biden,” DeSantis said at his kickoff speech Tuesday night in Clive, a suburb of Des Moines, even as he stepped up his attacks on Trump. “And I think he should do the same.”
Advisers to DeSantis said his more assertive posture stemmed largely from the fact that he is now an actual candidate. But it is a notable shift. At a recent dinner with donors in Tallahassee, Florida, DeSantis was asked when he would start slugging Trump, and he suggested he would not be doing so immediately, according to an attendee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private conversation.
For the third time in DeSantis’ three trips to Iowa this year, Trump planned to follow close behind with a two-day swing of his own. In March, when DeSantis came for his book tour, Trump arrived days later in the same city and drew a bigger crowd. In mid-May, Trump had scheduled a rally to stomp on the Florida governor’s trip, though he canceled at the last minute, saying it was because of the weather. It was DeSantis who one-upped him then, appearing at a barbecue joint nearby.
“The weather was so nice that we felt we just had to come,” DeSantis said to laughs in Clive.

“Our great American comeback tour starts by sending Joe Biden back to his basement in Delaware,” he said in Council Bluffs.
In contrast, DeSantis criticized Trump, a bombastic former reality television star, indirectly though pointedly.
“The Bible makes very clear that God frowns upon pride and looks to people who have humility,” he said.
In recent days, DeSantis has seemed especially eager to discuss his handling of the coronavirus, which vaulted him to national prominence. Trump recently unfavorably compared the Florida governor’s handling of the pandemic to that of former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat.
DeSantis has tried to turn this attack around, noting that at least at the beginning of the pandemic, the Trump and Cuomo administrations agreed on the need to close nonessential businesses to curb the spread of the virus.
“The former president would double down on his lockdowns from March of 2020,” DeSantis said.
“Do you want Cuomo or do you want free Florida?” he added. “If we just decided the caucuses on that, I would be happy with that verdict by Iowa voters.”

Robin Wagner, Savvy Set Designer Who Won 3 Tonys, Is Dead at 89: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He created sets for more than 50 of Broadway's most celebrated productions, including "Hair," "A Chorus Line," "On the Twentieth Century" and "The Producers."
Robin Wagner, the inventive Tony Award-winning set designer of more than 50 Broadway shows, including the 1978 musical "On the Twentieth Century," in which a locomotive appeared to be racing toward the audience with the actress Imogene Coca strapped to the front of it, died on Monday at his home in New York City. He was 89.
His daughter Christie Wagner Lee confirmed the death but said she did not yet know the specific cause. She did not say in what borough he lived.
Mr. Wagner designed sets on Broadway, Off Broadway and for regional theater, for operas and ballets, and, in 1975, for the Rolling Stones' Tour of the Americas. His stage for those concerts was shaped like a six-pointed lotus flower that was raked upward to the back in a delicate curve.
On Broadway, his work included the sets for the transcendent 1968 rock musical "Hair" (in The New York Times, Clive Barnes described a "beautiful junk-art setting") as well as "The Great White Hope," "Jesus Christ Superstar," "42nd Street," "Young Frankenstein," "Jelly's Last Jam," "Dreamgirls" and Tony Kushner's "Angels in America: Millennium Approaches" and "Angels in America: Perestroika."
Mr. Wagner's stage designs could be elaborate or simple, depending on the story and what the director wanted. He viewed scenic design as problem solving.
"When I'm reading the script, I can see it, how it fits together and how you get from one scene to another," he told The Los Angeles Times in 1991. "I guess that's what makes designers designers -- they visualize things a certain way."
For the musical "City of Angels," which opened on Broadway in 1989, he created dual color schemes to match the interconnected stories that the show's writer, Larry Gelbart, set in a world of mansions, sound stages and solariums in 1940s Los Angeles. In sequences involving an author who was turning his novel into a screenplay, everything was in color, while those involving a private eye movie character were in black and white, befitting the show's homage to film noir.
In his review in The Boston Globe, Kevin Kelly wrote that Mr. Wagner's set design was "brilliant, with flats moving on and off in a rhythm that is nothing if not movie-ish and with a final pull back to a Hollywood sound stage that is Cecil B. De Mille breathtaking."
Mr. Wagner won a Tony Award for "City of Angels," his second for scenic design following one in 1978 for "On the Twentieth Century." He won a third in 2001, for "The Producers," Mel Brooks's hit about a scheming pair who try to make a financial killing by purposely staging a Broadway flop.
One of his most enduring designs, which did not receive a Tony nomination, was his simplest. For "A Chorus Line," the producer Joseph Papp's ultimately long-running musical about dancers auditioning for a Broadway musical, Mr. Wagner's design consisted only of mirrored walls, black velour drapes and a white line on the floor.
"That was the result of two years' work of Michael Bennett and I trying to distill things," Mr. Wagner told Playbill in 2007, referring to the director and co-choreographer of the show, which opened on Broadway in 1975. "We started with big things for visualizing scenes, and as we went through the show's workshop period, they got smaller and smaller."
He added, "And then we knew we needed a black box, which represents theater, and that we needed the mirrors, because they represent the dance studio."
Robin Samuel Anton Wagner was born on Aug. 31, 1933, in San Francisco to Jens and Phyllis (Smith-Spurgeon) Wagner. His father, who had immigrated from Denmark, was a maritime engineer and, for a time, the keeper of two lighthouses where the Wagners lived until Robin was 10. His mother had been a pianist in New Zealand before moving to the United States, where she was a homemaker.
As a boy, Robin was enamored of Disney films like "Fantasia" and hoped to be an animator, creating the backgrounds of cartoons, not the characters. "I actually thought I was Pinocchio, trying to find my way into some kind of real life, which I still think I sometimes am," he said in an oral history interview with Columbia University in 1992.
He created comic books in junior high school and, after high school, attended the California School of Fine Arts (later the San Francisco Art Institute) from 1953 to 1954. While there, and after, he worked on set design with theater and opera groups, like the Actor's Workshop of San Francisco; built window displays for a clothing store; and got a paying design job in summer stock with the Sacramento Music Circus.
Mr. Wagner moved in 1958 to New York, where he became an assistant to one Broadway designer, Ben Edwards, and then another, Oliver Smith. From 1964 to 1967, he was the set designer for Arena Stage, the renowned regional theater in Washington.
Returning to New York, he designed the sets for "Hair," which Clive Barnes, in The Times, described as "masterly."
George Wolfe, the director who worked with him on several shows, including the "Angels in America" productions, said that Mr. Wagner had a talent for finding the essence of a story. He recalled one of Mr. Wagner's small, but effective, touches on "Jelly's Last Jam," the 1992 musical about the jazz pioneer Jelly Roll Morton.
"Jelly was dying in L.A., and Robin created three jagged neon lines that looked like the graphic of an earthquake," Mr. Wolfe said in a telephone interview. "It was so breathtakingly simple; it was along the lower part of the back wall."
He added, "Just those three lines, you knew it was L.A."
But there was also a complex engineer's side to Mr. Wagner, which was on view with "Dreamgirls," Mr. Bennett's 1981 musical based loosely on the career of the Supremes. Mr. Wagner designed five aluminum, spotlight-studded towers that moved in various configurations to create -- with minimal use of props -- the illusion that the setting was changing from a nightclub to a recording studio to a Las Vegas show palace.
"And all the lighting bars were basically platforms," Mr. Wagner told Playbill, "so the actors could climb up on those things and fly out, which they did."
Mr. Wagner's "Dreamgirls" design earned him a Tony nomination and one of his six Drama Desk Awards.
His final Broadway credit was for "Leap of Faith," a musical about a fraudulent evangelist, in 2012.
In addition to his daughter Christie, he is survived by his partner, Susan Kowal; another daughter, Leslie Wagner; a son, Kurt; and a granddaughter. His marriages to Joyce Workman and Paula Kauffman ended in divorce.
The train that Mr. Wagner designed for "On the Twentieth Century" was one of his great creations, with its long, elegant, streamlined interior consisting of adjoining compartments that were open on one side to let the characters be seen. Train exteriors that slid in front of the compartments let the audience look at the actors from the outside, after they had peered inside at them.
"This gesture," the architecture critic Paul Goldberger wrote in The Times, "aside from notably enhancing the cinematic quality of the show -- nothing is more movie-like than quick cuts from inside to outside -- is also a gentle and pleasing play on the traditional description of the stage set as a room in which the fourth wall has been removed."

As Christie Considers Presidential Run, His Supporters Form a Super PAC: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The former governor of New Jersey, who has been at times both a confidant and a rival of Donald Trump, will have some outside help in his effort to win the Republican primary.
Allies of former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey have formed a super PAC to support him in the nascent Republican primary, as he makes preparations for a likely campaign kickoff in the next two weeks, according to an official with the group and others briefed on the matter.
Mr. Christie's candidacy is likely to to focus in part on drawing a stark contrast with former President Donald J. Trump. Mr. Christie supported Mr. Trump in 2016 and worked with him during his presidency, but they split over Mr. Trump's claims on election night in 2020 that the race was stolen from him.
People who have been close to Mr. Christie for years are leading the outside group, Tell It Like It Is, which is laying the groundwork for an imminent announcement, one of the people briefed on the matter said. Brian Jones, an aide who advised Senator John McCain's presidential bid in 2008 and Mitt Romney's in 2012, will run the effort.
William P. Palatucci, a longtime adviser to Mr. Christie and a Republican National Committee member, will be the chair. Another long-serving adviser to Mr. Christie, Russ Schriefer, will oversee messaging as a senior adviser; and Brent Seaborn, a veteran data guru, will focus on voter targeting.
Maria Comella, an adviser who also was chief of staff to former Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, and Mike DuHaime, Mr. Christie's top political strategist in 2016, are expected to run an eventual campaign if Mr. Christie announces as expected. Anthony Scaramucci, the hedge fund adviser who served for less than two weeks as a communications director in the Trump White House and has become a vocal Trump critic, has said he will support Mr. Christie if he runs.
Mr. Christie "is willing to confront the hard truths that currently threaten the future of the Republican Party," Mr. Jones said in a statement. "Now more than ever we need leaders that have the courage to say not what we want to hear but what we need to hear."
Mr. Christie has said recently that he would run if he believed he could win, but he had indicated that there were organizational issues he needed to figure out. The existence of the super PAC and the pending announcement suggest those issues have been resolved.
A Christie candidacy is seen as a long shot in a Republican Party that has been remade in Mr. Trump's image eight years after Mr. Christie first ran for president. Mr. Trump vanquished him, and Mr. Christie dropped out after coming in sixth in New Hampshire, where he had staked his candidacy.
A central challenge of this campaign will be explaining to voters his transformation. He endorsed Mr. Trump in 2016, helped him with debate prep and acted at times as an informal adviser during his presidency. Then, in the earliest hours of Nov. 4, 2020, Mr. Christie split with him when he questioned Mr. Trump's declaration that there had been widespread fraud in the election.
"We heard nothing today about any evidence," Mr. Christie said in an appearance on ABC News. "This kind of thing, all it does is inflame without informing. And we cannot permit inflammation without information."
Since then, Mr. Christie has become a full-throated critic of Mr. Trump, talking as a former federal prosecutor about the former president's legal travails and describing him as a loser who can no longer command the crowds he once did. Mr. Christie's candidacy is being watched by donors who either like what he's saying or see him as the best opportunity to damage Mr. Trump, particularly from a debate stage.
And like some other candidates, such as former Vice President Mike Pence, Mr. Christie appears to be banking on the notion that there are enough vestiges of the old Republican Party to which he can appeal.
While New Hampshire is seen as a potentially favorable state where Mr. Christie could make inroads, his advisers are not expected to hang his candidacy on a specific state. Instead, he is expected to try to get as much media attention as possible with an unconventional campaign that will travel to places where his message is most appealing.
He will be coming into the 2024 race as the person with the most coherent case against Mr. Trump while arguing that the fight needs to be taken directly to the former president.
Mr. Christie is hoping to tamp down some of the grievance that has seeped into the roots of political discourse in the Republican Party since Mr. Trump became the party's nominee in 2016. Mr. Christie is approaching the race, allies say, with the goal of delivering a hopeful message.
But Mr. Christie has also repeatedly taken shots at Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, the distant second to Mr. Trump in most public polls, describing Mr. DeSantis's fight with Disney in particular as an overreach.
"Where are we headed here now that, if you express disagreement in this country, the government is allowed to punish you? To me, that's what I always thought liberals did. And now all of a sudden here we are participating in this with a Republican governor," Mr. Christie said last month.

Full text: The Mystery of the Disappearing van Gogh
The bidding for Lot 17 started at $ 23 million.
In the packed room at Sotheby's in Manhattan, the price quickly climbed: $ 32 million, $ 42 million, $ 48 million. Then a new prospective buyer, calling from China, made it a contest between just two people.
On the block that evening in November 2014 were works by Impressionist painters and Modernist sculptors that would make the auction the most successful yet in the firm's history. But one painting drew particular attention: "Still Life, Vase with Daisies and Poppies," completed by Vincent van Gogh weeks before his death.
Pushing the price to almost $ 62 million, the Chinese caller prevailed. His offer was the highest ever for a van Gogh still life at auction.
In the discreet world of high-end art, buyers often remain anonymous. But the winning bidder, a prominent movie producer, would proclaim in interview after interview that he was the painting's new owner.
The producer, Wang Zhongjun, was on a roll. His company had just helped bring "Fury," the World War II movie starring Brad Pitt, to cinemas. He dreamed of making his business China's version of the Walt Disney Company.
The sale, according to Chinese media, became a national "sensation." It was a sign -- after the acquisition of a Picasso by a Chinese real estate tycoon the year before -- that the country was becoming a force in the global art market.
"Ten years ago, I could not have imagined purchasing a van Gogh," Mr. Wang said in a Chinese-language interview with Sotheby's. "After buying it, I loved it so much."
But Mr. Wang may not be the real owner at all. Two other men were linked to the purchase: an obscure middleman in Shanghai who paid Sotheby's bill through a Caribbean shell company, and the person he answered to -- a reclusive billionaire in Hong Kong.
The billionaire, Xiao Jianhua, was one of the most influential tycoons of China's gilded age, creating a financial empire in recent decades by exploiting ties to the Communist Party elite and a new class of superrich businessmen. He also controlled a hidden offshore network of more than 130 companies holding over $ 5 billion in assets, according to corporate documents obtained by The New York Times. Among them was Sotheby's invoice for the van Gogh.
The secrecy that pervades the art world and its dealmakers -- including international auction houses like Sotheby's -- has drawn scrutiny in the years since the sale as authorities try to combat criminal activity. Large transactions often pass through murky intermediaries, and the vetting of them is opaque. Citing client confidentiality, Sotheby's declined to comment on the purchase.
Today, Mr. Xiao is a man who has fallen far. Abducted from his luxury apartment and now imprisoned in mainland China, he was convicted of bribery and other misdeeds that prosecutors claimed had threatened the country's financial security. Meanwhile, Mr. Wang is struggling, liquidating properties as his film studio loses money each year.
And the still life, according to several art experts, has been offered for private sale. For a century after van Gogh gathered flowers and placed them in an earthen vase to paint, the artwork's provenance could be easily traced, and the piece was often exhibited in museums for visitors to admire. Now the painting has vanished from public view, its whereabouts unknown.
A Painting's Many Lives
In May 1890, van Gogh arrived in Auvers-sur-Oise, a rustic village outside Paris. Deeply depressed, he had cut off much of his left ear a year and a half earlier. His stay at an asylum had not helped.
But within hours of coming to the village, he met Paul-Ferdinand Gachet, a doctor and an art enthusiast.
"I've found in Dr. Gachet a ready-made friend and something like a new brother," van Gogh wrote to his sister.
The physician encouraged van Gogh to ignore his melancholy and focus on his paintings. He completed nearly 80 of them in two months, including "Portrait of Dr. Gachet," considered a masterpiece. He produced "Vase With Daisies and Poppies" at the physician's home and may have given it to him in exchange for treatment, biographers say.
After van Gogh's death in July 1890, the painting passed to a Parisian collector, and then, in 1911, as the artist's fame was rising, to a Berlin art dealer. A series of German collectors owned it before A. Conger Goodyear, a Buffalo industrialist and a founder of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, bought it in 1928. His son George later granted partial ownership to Buffalo's Albright-Knox Art Gallery, which displayed it for nearly three decades.
In May 1990, capping years of record-breaking prices for van Goghs, a Japanese businessman spent $ 82.5 million for "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" at Christie's, then the highest price paid at auction for any artwork.
About that time, Mr. Goodyear wanted to sell the 26-by-20-inch still life to raise money for another museum. It failed to sell at Christie's in November 1990, where it had been expected to fetch between $ 12 million and $ 16 million. Soon after, a lower offer was accepted from a buyer who remained anonymous.
Most of the 400 or so oil paintings van Gogh produced during his last years -- considered his best work -- are at arts institutions around the world. About 15 percent are in private hands and not regularly on loan to museums. In the past decade, just 16 have been offered at auction, according to Artnet, an industry database. Among them was "Orchard With Cypresses," from the collection of the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, which Christie's sold last year for $ 117 million to an undisclosed buyer.
The Producer and the Billionaire
For a year after the November 2014 auction, Mr. Wang kept the still life at his $ 25 million apartment in Hong Kong. In October 2015, the film producer was the guest of honor at a five-day exhibition in the city. An amateur artist, he had more than a dozen of his own oil paintings on display.
But the main attractions were the van Gogh and a Picasso he had recently bought, "Woman With a Hairbun on a Sofa." Sotheby's said Mr. Wang had paid nearly $ 30 million for the work.
Until then, Japanese industrialists, followed by American hedge fund managers and Russian oligarchs, had captured headlines for record-breaking purchases. Around 2012, newly rich Chinese buyers, who had benefited from their country's market-opening policies, came on the scene.
"All the auction houses really jumped on that," said David Norman, who headed Sotheby's Impressionist and Modern art department when the van Gogh was sold.
Chinese billionaires were often delighted to announce their big-ticket purchases. In 2013, a retail magnate bought a Picasso for $ 28 million at Christie's, following up with a $ 20 million Monet at Sotheby's in 2015. The same year, a stock investor spent $ 170 million at Christie's for a Modigliani.
"It is a combination of vanity, investment and building their own brand," said Kejia Wu, who taught at Sotheby's Institute of Art and is the author of a new book on China's art market.
Mr. Wang, 63, basked in the spotlight. In interviews, he spoke of his admiration for van Gogh and the artist's influence on him. "Few people in the world would buy this kind of painting -- there aren't that many who love Impressionist art this much and can afford it, right?"
Days after the hammer fell at Sotheby's, Mr. Wang had told a Chinese publication that he had not bought the painting alone, though he offered no details. Later, he no longer mentioned any partner. "When I saw the painting at a preview, I just felt like owning it -- it stirred my heart," he said in an interview published on Sotheby's website.
The high-profile acquisition, made through an intermediary and with the ultimate source of funds remaining a secret, is the kind of transaction governments have been trying to curb in recent years.
In one scandal, the United States charged a Malaysian businessman with laundering billions of dollars from a state development fund, using some of it to buy art at Sotheby's and Christie's. In 2020, the Senate issued a scathing report on how auction houses and art dealers had unwittingly helped Russians evade sanctions by allowing others to buy art for them.
A spokeswoman for Sotheby's said it vetted all buyers and, when necessary, enlisted its compliance department for "enhanced due diligence." Sotheby's applies worldwide a 2020 European Union rule that requires auction houses to verify the legitimacy of funds.
While the financial documents involving the van Gogh do not show wrongdoing, the transaction was hardly routine. Soon after the auction, Sotheby's transferred ownership of the painting to the Shanghai man, neither a known art agent nor a collector, who paid the bill. But in a public ceremony, Sotheby's handed over the painting not to him or the billionaire who employed him but to the producer, Mr. Wang.
"There's a connection to someone who is now incarcerated," said Leila Amineddoleh, a New York-based art lawyer. "Something unusual is going on."
'White Gloves'
The man Sotheby's considers the owner of the van Gogh lives in a Shanghai apartment complex where gray tiles and grimy grout frame a weather-beaten door. A mat out front states nine times, in English, "I am an artist."
The occupant, Liu Hailong, is listed as the sole owner and lone director of the shell company in the British Virgin Islands that paid for the painting: Islandwide Holdings Limited. Other than his date and place of birth, little is known about Mr. Liu, 46.
When a reporter recently showed him the Sotheby's invoice and a bank wire document and asked whether the signature was his, he said, "Please leave immediately," and shut the door.
A woman living with him, Zhao Tingting, has her own connection to the jailed billionaire, Mr. Xiao. She was once a top official at a company he co-founded, which had business dealings with relatives of China's top leader, Xi Jinping.
Ms. Zhao, 43, who no longer holds that position, now teaches piano. Asked about Mr. Liu's purchase of the van Gogh, she responded, "Do you think our house comes close to the price of that painting?"
She and Mr. Liu were "just ordinary little employees," she said, with no connection to the Tomorrow Group, the collection of companies controlled by the billionaire. "We have no right to make any decisions and no right to know anything."
The couple appear to have been "white gloves," a term used in China to describe proxy shareholders meant to hide companies' true owners. Among the thousands of pages of records providing details about the Tomorrow Group is a spreadsheet listing dozens of such people. At least four offshore companies were registered in Mr. Liu's name.
Those companies were part of Mr. Xiao's vast enterprise. He had showed early promise, gaining admission to China's prestigious Peking University at age 14 and serving as a student leader during the 1989 Tiananmen protests. He sided with the government, an allegiance that would help him become one of the country's richest men, acquiring control of banks, insurers and brokerages, as well as stakes in coal, cement and real estate.
Unlike the many brash billionaires he did business with, Mr. Xiao, now 51, preferred to operate in the shadows, building ties to some of China's princelings. He settled into a quiet life at the Four Seasons, where a coterie of female bodyguards attended to his needs.
Why one of his lieutenants paid for the van Gogh is not clear. Mr. Wang, the producer, was among the ranks of China's wealthiest people, though not nearly as rich as Mr. Xiao.
Mr. Xiao's easy access to money outside China through his offshore network allowed him to bypass the country's strict currency controls; he may have acted as a kind of banker for Mr. Wang. The documents show that the two men were drawing up art investment plans the same month as the auction, but their joint venture, based in the Seychelles, wasn't formed until a year later. Meanwhile, the two set up another offshore company, aimed at investing in film and television projects in North America.
There could be another explanation for the payment: Mr. Xiao may have wanted to acquire an asset that could be transported across borders in a private jet, free from scrutiny by bank compliance officers and government regulators.
An Abduction, and a Vanishing Act
The fortunes of the men connected to the van Gogh purchase began to turn in 2015 with the crash of the Chinese stock market. Mr. Xi's government blamed market manipulation by well-connected traders, and regulators wrested economic power back from the billionaires. Dozens of financiers disappeared, only to resurface in police custody.
Art purchases became more discreet. In 2016, Oprah Winfrey sold a Klimt painting to an anonymous Chinese buyer for $ 150 million.
By early 2017, Mr. Xiao's life as a free man was over. One night, about a half-dozen men put him in a wheelchair -- he was not known to use one -- covered his face and removed him from his Hong Kong apartment. He was taken to mainland China and eventually charged. Prosecutors claimed that his crimes dated back before 2014, the year the van Gogh was sold.
He was sentenced last August to 13 years in prison for manipulating financial markets and bribing state officials. The court said Mr. Xiao and his company had misused more than $ 20 billion.
Government officials dismantled his companies in China. At some point, the British Virgin Islands business that bought the van Gogh changed hands and Mr. Liu was removed as its owner.
For a while, Mr. Wang, the producer, maintained a high-flying lifestyle, opening a private museum in Beijing in 2017 that showcased the van Gogh and Picasso paintings for a few months.
But the market value of his film studio, Huayi Brothers, vaporized as it backed flops. Mr. Wang let go much of his art collection and his Hong Kong home. Last year the Beijing museum was sold off, along with a mansion tied to him in Beverly Hills.
Mr. Wang and a spokesman for his company did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Mr. Xiao could not be reached for comment in prison, though a family representative said the billionaire's wife did not know of any involvement in the van Gogh purchase and was unfamiliar with Mr. Liu.
Van Gogh's floral still life -- a vibrant painting by one of the world's most acclaimed artists -- hasn't been seen publicly for years. But there are reports that the artwork may be back on the market.
Three people, including two former Sotheby's executives and a New York art adviser, requesting anonymity, said the painting had been offered for private sale. Last year, the adviser viewed a written proposal to buy it for about $ 70 million.
The art experts did not know whether the painting had sold or if concerns had been raised about the 2014 sale -- a purchase by a onetime lieutenant to a now disgraced billionaire linked to a beleaguered film producer who claims the art belongs to him.
"Nobody needs a $ 62 million van Gogh, and nobody wants to buy a lawsuit," said Thomas C. Danziger, an art lawyer. "If there's any question about the painting's ownership, people will buy a different artwork -- or another airplane."

Full text: "Transforming Spaces" is a series about women driving change in sometimes unexpected places.
Geena Davis and her family were returning from dinner in their small Massachusetts town when her great-uncle Jack, 99, began drifting into the oncoming lane of traffic. Ms. Davis was about 8, flanked by her parents in the back seat. Politeness suffused the car, the family, maybe the era, and nobody remarked on what was happening, even when another car appeared in the distance, speeding toward them.
Finally, moments before impact, Ms. Davis's grandmother issued a gentle suggestion from the passenger seat: "A little to the right, Jack." They missed by inches.
Ms. Davis, 67, relayed this story in her 2022 memoir, "Dying of Politeness," an encapsulation of the genially stultifying values that she had absorbed as a child -- and that a great many other girls absorb, too: Defer. Go along to get along. Everything's fine.
Of course the Academy Award-winning actress ditched that pliability long ago. From "Thelma & Louise" and "A League of Their Own" to this year's coming-of-age drama, "Fairyland," back-seat docility just wasn't an option. Indeed, self-possession was her thing. (Or one of her things. Few profiles have failed to mention her Mensa membership, her fluency in Swedish or her Olympic-caliber archery prowess.) But cultivating her own audaciousness was only Phase 1.
Next year will mark two decades since the creation of the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media. When her daughter was a toddler, Ms. Davis couldn't help noticing that male characters vastly outnumbered female characters in children's TV and movies.
"I knew everything is completely imbalanced in the world," she said recently. But this was the realm of make-believe; why shouldn't it be 50/50?
It wasn't just the numbers. How the women were represented, their aspirations, the way young girls were sexualized: Across children's programming, Ms. Davis saw a bewilderingly warped vision of reality being beamed into impressionable minds. Long before "diversity, equity and inclusion" would enter the lexicon, she began mentioning this gender schism whenever she had an industry meeting.
"Everyone said, 'No, no, no -- it used to be like that, but it's been fixed,"' she said. "I started to wonder, What if I got the data to prove that I'm right about this?"
Amid Hollywood's trumpeted causes, Ms. Davis made it her mission to quietly harvest data. Exactly how bad is that schism? In what other ways does it play out? Beyond gender, who else is being marginalized? In lieu of speechifying and ribbons, and with sponsors ranging from Google to Hulu, Ms. Davis's team of researchers began producing receipts.
Ms. Davis wasn't the first to highlight disparities in popular entertainment. But by leveraging her reputation and resources -- and by blasting technology at the problem -- she made a hazy truth concrete and offered offenders a discreet path toward redemption. (While the institute first focused on gender data, its analyses now extend to race/ethnicity, L.G.B.T.Q.I.A.+, disability, age 50-plus and body type. Random awful finding: Overweight characters are more than twice as likely to be violent.)
Even when braced for it, the institute's findings are staggering: In the 101 top-grossing G-rated films from 1990 to 2005, just 28 percent of speaking characters were female. Even in crowd scenes -- even in animated crowd scenes -- male characters vastly outnumber female ones. In the 56 top grossing films of 2018, women portrayed in positions of leadership were four times more likely than men to be shown naked. (The bodies of 15 percent of them were filmed in slow motion.) Where a century ago women had been fully central to the budding film industry, they were now a quantifiable, if sexy, afterthought.
"When she started to collect the data, it was kind of incredible," said Hillary Hallett, a professor of American studies at Columbia University and the author of "Go West, Young Women! The Rise of Early Hollywood." "This wasn't a vague feeling anymore. You couldn't claim this was just some feminist rant. It was like, 'Look at these numbers."'
Ms. Davis is by turns reserved and goofy offscreen -- a thoughtful responder, an unbridled guffawer. (At one point she enunciated the word "acting" so theatrically that she feared it would be hard to spell in this article.) On a recent afternoon in Los Angeles, she took a break from illustrating the children's book she had written, "The Girl Who Was Too Big for the Page."
"I grew up very self-conscious about being the tallest kid -- not just the tallest girl -- in my class," she said. "I had this childhood-long wish to take up less space in the world."
In time she began to look beyond her height -- six feet -- to the insidious messages reinforcing such insecurity.
"Hollywood creates our cultural narrative -- its biases trickle down to the rest of the world," she said in "This Changes Everything," the 2018 documentary she produced about gender inequity in the film industry. The documentary takes its name from the incessant refrain she kept hearing after the success of "Thelma & Louise," and later "A League of Their Own." Finally the power and profitability of female-centric movies had been proven -- this changes everything! And then, year after year, nothing.
It was here that Ms. Davis planted her stake in the ground -- a contention around why certain injustices persist, and how best to combat them. Where movements like #MeToo and Times Up target deliberate acts of monstrosity, hers would be the squishier universe of unconscious bias. Did you unthinkingly cast that doctor as a male? Hire that straight white director because he shares your background? Thought you were diversifying your film, only to reinforce old stereotypes? (Fiery Latina, anyone?)
It's a dogged optimism that powers Ms. Davis's activism -- a faith that Hollywood can reform voluntarily. When she goes to a meeting now, she's armed with her team's latest research, and with conviction that improvement will follow.
"Our theory of change relies on the content creators to do good," said Madeline Di Nonno, the president and the chief executive of the institute. "As Geena says, we never shame and blame. You have to pick your lane, and ours has always been, 'We collaborate with you and want you to do better."'
If a car full of polite Davises can awaken to oncoming danger, perhaps filmmakers can come to see the harm they're perpetuating.
"Everyone isn't out there necessarily trying to screw women or screw Black people," said Franklin Leonard, a film and television producer and founder of the Black List, a popular platform for screenplays that have not been produced. "But the choices they make definitely have that consequence, regardless of what they believe about their intent."
He added: "It's not something people are necessarily aware of. And there's no paper trail -- it can only be revealed in aggregate. Which gets to the value of Geena's work."
Unique to the institute's efforts is its partnership with the University of Southern California's Signal Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory, which uses software and machine learning to analyze scripts and other media. One tool born of that collaboration, Spellcheck for Bias, employs AI to scan scripts for stereotypes and other problematic choices. (Janine Jones-Clark, the executive vice president for inclusion for NBCUniversal's global talent development and inclusion team, recalled a scene in a television show in which a person of color seemed to be acting in a threatening manner toward another character. Once flagged by the software, the scene was reshot.)
Still, progress has been mixed. In 2019 and 2020, the institute reported that gender parity for female lead characters had been achieved in the 100 highest-grossing family films and in the top Nielsen-rated children's television shows. Nearly 70 percent of industry executives familiar with the institute's research made changes to at least two projects.
But women represented just 18 percent of directors working on the top 250 films of 2022, up only 1 percent from 2021, according to the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film; the percentage of major Asian and Asian American female characters fell from 10 percent in 2021 to under 7 percent in 2022. A 2021 McKinsey report showed that 92 percent of film executives were white -- less diverse than Donald Trump's cabinet at the time, as Mr. Leonard of the Black List noted.
"I think the industry is more resistant to change than anybody realizes," he added. "So I'm incredibly appreciative of anyone -- and especially someone with Geena's background -- doing the non-glamorous stuff of trying to change it, being in the trenches with Excel spreadsheets."
Ms. Davis has not quit her day job. (Coming soon: a role in "Pussy Island," a thriller from Zoe Kravitz in her directorial debut.) But acting shares a billing with her books, the diversity-focused Bentonville Film Festival she started in Arkansas in 2015 -- even the roller coasters she rides for equity. (Yes, Thelma is now Disney's gender consultant for its theme parks and resorts.)
"We're definitely heading in the right direction," she said. "Bill Gates called himself an impatient optimist, and that feels pretty good for what I am."

Full text: With an eye to the Kennedys, and the Trumps. Sometimes, a wardrobe is a strategy.
Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida has finally, officially, entered the presidential race. The long-anticipated Trump-DeSantis matchup is about to hit prime time. Which means that so, too, is what Mr. DeSantis himself called in his recent book, "The Courage to Be Free," the "Ron and Casey traveling road show," a Camelot-meets-Mar-a-Lago by way of Disney series that is now going national. And while Mr. DeSantis may be the nominal star, it is his wife, in her supporting role, who has been making the most notable entrances.
At least judging by the previews that have been playing for the past few months at most of Mr. DeSantis's major public events, including his re-election night celebration in November 2022, his inauguration in January, his State of the State speech in March and his trip to Japan last month. Throughout, Ms. DeSantis, 42, a former television news anchor, mother of three and breast cancer survivor, has demonstrated a facility with the power of the visual statement, and the way it can tap into the national hive mind, that has been as strategic, and big picture, as that of any political spouse in modern memory.
"She understands the image game and how to play it," said Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist who masterminded communications for the confirmation of the Supreme Court justice Neil Gorsuch. "How to maximize the levers of attention and the media."
Put another way, while Mr. DeSantis may be talking presidential policy, Ms. DeSantis has been making him look the part, primarily by "dressing her part," said Kate Andersen Brower, the author of "First Women: The Grace and Power of America's Modern First Ladies." By using all sorts of synaptic cues to connect what we see to what we think, she triggers associations with terms like "Kennedy" and "Trump" and even "royalty" -- not as odd a grouping as it may first appear, given that Kennedy was the first TV president, Trump the first reality TV president and Ms. DeSantis clearly a student of both.
She has the bouncing, glowing Breck locks of Belle from "Beauty and the Beast" (the 1991 animated version) and Catherine, Princess of Wales mixed up with the full-skirted pastel wardrobe of a well-mannered debutante, some fleece and a cape or two. She's "dressing to be either princess of the world or first lady," said Tom Broecker, the costume designer for "Saturday Night Live" and "House of Cards," who has made something of an art of studying and replicating the style of first ladies. "There's so much intentionality and purpose behind everything."
To acknowledge that is not to undercut her substance -- the work she has done for mental health, cancer research, hurricane relief -- but to credit her with understanding a basic truth of modern campaigning. "Presidential campaigns are M.R.I.s for the soul," said David M. Axelrod, the founder of the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago and a former senior adviser to Barack Obama. "Folks are not just evaluating your positions, they are evaluating you as a person." To that end, he said, "spouses play a really important role in filling out that picture."
Picture, in this case, being the operative word.
The Camelot Connection
Though Ms. DeSantis has always been a considered dresser, a lesson from her days as a local anchor with WJXT in Jacksonville, Fla., when she and Mr. DeSantis met, she has ratcheted up her style over the past year. On election night in 2022, she wore a floor-length gold and yellow one-shoulder ruched gown that made her look as if she were on her way to a state dinner, rather than simply taking the stage in the Tampa Convention Center.
It was her outfit on inauguration day in January, however, that really foreshadowed the couple's ambitions in the public eye: a mint-green dress by Alex Perry, an Australian label, with a built-in cape flowing from the shoulders, worn with white gloves. In its color and line, it seemed to draw its lineage straight from the Kennedy era. This was only compounded by the bright pink dress Ms. DeSantis wore to her husband's State of the State address, with a portrait neckline and more white gloves, another seeming nod to Jacqueline Kennedy, one of the most recognizable, revered and stylish first ladies in American history. Ditto the ice-blue dress she wore to accompany Mr. DeSantis to Japan, another caped style, this time with floral epaulets at the shoulders.
It's a smart move, even if it can also seem like a cliché (clichés are clichés, after all, because they are part of common parlance). As Michael LaRosa, a communications strategist who was Jill Biden's spokesman during her husband's 2020 primary campaign for the White House, said: "Americans love glitz, glamour and attractiveness, celebrities and TV. Casey DeSantis understands all of that."
By connecting herself and her husband implicitly to the Kennedy tradition, Ms. DeSantis connects to myriad ideas rooted in the American narrative: youth and generational change (not incidental when two of the other candidates are setting records as the oldest in history), glamour and taste. Blink, and a button deep in the cerebral cortex gets pushed.
Never more so than when she dons her capes and gloves, accessories from the costume department freighted with meaning, trailing whiffs of kings and queens as well as old-fashioned morality and gender roles. The clothes both act as a "disguise for how political and strategic she is," Ms. Brower said, and support her husband's position as a warrior for conservative values.
So while Ms. DeSantis may be, as The New York Post called her, the governor's "not-so-secret political weapon" and, according to Politico, a "superstar of a political spouse" who is "unusually important and uncommonly involved," with her own portfolio, the broad-stroke portrait is of the classic helpmeet smiling charmingly in the background.
"She has been able to use her position to showcase what they could be," Mr. Bonjean said.
According to Mr. Broecker, she is "manifesting the message."
Beyond Trump
And the image-making is not limited to herself. Like Catherine, Princess of Wales, Ms. DeSantis is adept at color-coordinating the couple's young children for their public appearances, the better to present a snapshot of family unity: the two little girls wearing matching dresses and pinafores, their brother echoing their father. She and Mr. DeSantis even wore matching white rubber shrimp boots when viewing the damage after Hurricane Ian.
It all makes for an implicit contrast to the current Republican front-runner, Donald J. Trump, whose own children have been divided during the campaign (Ivanka staying away, Tiffany largely absent) and whose wife, Melania, has been largely absent since his announcement.
And though Ms. DeSantis shares a certain style ethos with Ms. Trump, her clothes are more aspirational than elitist, sourced largely from the contemporary, as opposed to luxury, market, with an emphasis on brands like Ted Baker (the blue coat she wore for her husband's first inauguration), Badgley Mischka (the caped dress and white floral pantsuit she wore in Japan) and Shoshanna (that gold and yellow ruched gown).
All of which fits with the more accessible narrative the campaign is building around her -- especially when combined with the zip-up athletic jackets with the Florida state flag on the breast that she tends to wear with jeans when meeting constituents on the road.
Put another way, both Ms. DeSantis and Ms. Trump may have worn Republican-red caped gowns at different times, but while Ms. Trump's was Givenchy, Ms. DeSantis's appears to have been Trina Turk. Ms. Brower called the effect "Melania lite" -- easier for most people to digest.
Yet Ms. DeSantis also chose a label for her official portrait -- Chiara Boni La Petite Robe -- that is the unofficial uniform of the women of Trumpland, a favorite of Lara Trump, Kimberly Guilfoyle, Kayleigh McEnany and Jeanine Pirro, thanks to its ability to play to both boss lady and the male gaze. All of which underscores her husband's pitch that he is the palatable alternative to Trump: familiar, but less baggage.
The DeSantis team declined to comment on Ms. DeSantis's role, but for those who think her image-making is simply happenstance or a fortuitous coincidence, consider the fact that in his book Mr. DeSantis notes that it was Ms. DeSantis who asked him to wear his naval "dress white uniform" for their wedding, complete with all his medals, though he had planned on wearing a tux.
She also held an on-air competition, he wrote, so viewers could vote on what wedding dress she should wear. When it came time to walk down the aisle, Mr. DeSantis wrote, she looked "less like a TV anchor and more like a princess." Together, however, they looked like nothing so much as cosplay from the triumphant finales of both "An Officer and a Gentleman" and "A Few Good Men."
In other words, from the beginning Ms. DeSantis was thinking about the images that would be captured for posterity and their public repercussions, and "I was happy to defer to my bride on that call," Mr. DeSantis wrote. Odds are that pattern will continue.
After all, when you can deploy a spouse in a primary, Mr. LaRosa said, "it's the equivalent of having the advantage of two candidates." You get twice the airtime and twice the eyeballs.
Indeed, Mr. Bonjean said, "The team will do everything they can to get attention. And she will be a big part of that."

What Kind of President Would DeSantis Be?: [Op-Ed]

Full text: As Republican candidates enter the race for their party's 2024 presidential nomination, Times columnists, Opinion writers and others will assess their strengths and weaknesses with a scorecard. We rate the candidates on a scale of 1 to 10: 1 means the candidate will probably drop out before any caucus or primary voting; 10 means the candidate has a very strong chance of receiving the party's nomination next summer. This entry assesses Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, who announced his bid for the Republican nomination on Wednesday.
How seriously should we take DeSantis's candidacy?
David Brooks Ron DeSantis was overvalued before and is undervalued now. He's still the most likely Trump alternative since he spans the Trump wing and the non-Trump wing of the G.O.P. But it would take a Trump implosion to bring that about. I doubt there's much that DeSantis can affirmatively do to control his destiny.
Jane Coaston Extremely seriously, and very literally.
Michelle Cottle About as seriously as a moderate to severe case of shingles. (So, pretty seriously.)
Ross Douthat More seriously than any Republican not named Donald Trump. Ron DeSantis's weaknesses are obvious -- social awkwardness above all -- but even as his poll numbers have sagged, nobody else has emerged from the pack, so he enters the race as the only currently plausible vehicle for Republicans who don't want Trump again.
David French We should take Ron DeSantis more seriously than many pundits are taking him today. He has struggled under Trump's relentless attacks, but he's still the clear second choice, and it's way too soon to write his campaign obituary.
Michelle Goldberg A few months ago, before it became clear what a problem his personality was going to be, I thought he was very likely to be the nominee. And until 6 p.m. on Wednesday, I still thought he had a decent chance. But I don't see how he comes back from that catastrophic Twitter launch.
Rosie Gray Ron DeSantis is the only Republican so far who appears capable of putting up a credible challenge to Trump. But his pre-candidacy wasn't very encouraging: He's allowed Trump to define him as a personality-challenged weirdo, and he has made politically questionable moves like the six-week abortion ban he signed.
Katherine Mangu-Ward He's a capable governor of a successful state who has a good eye for the places where political points can be scored -- mostly authoritarian culture-war stunts -- even if he isn't always successful in scoring them.
Daniel McCarthy He would be the front-runner any other year. He'll be the front-runner next year if luck somehow takes Donald Trump out of the race. As things stand, Ron DeSantis is as serious a contender as anyone can be with the ex-president in the contest.
Bret Stephens Three months ago, I would have predicted that Ron DeSantis, fresh from his resounding re-election as governor of Florida, would beat Trump for the Republican primary. Now he looks more like the Ted Cruz of this electoral cycle, pompous, mean and not nearly as clever as he seems to think he is.
What matters most about him as a presidential candidate?
Brooks DeSantis's problem is that he can't attack Trump, because a chunk of his support is Trumpy, and he can't not attack Trump, since Trump is flailing him day after day. I can't think of a candidate who took down a front-runner without criticizing him. DeSantis has locked himself into a posture in which he looks weak and passive.
Coaston He is in almost every way a standard presidential candidate -- a successful governor of a big state looking to make the leap to the national stage. That seeming regularity makes him seem familiar, recognizable, even.
Cottle He has long been the great hope of the many, many G.O.P. donors and other establishment Republicans desperate to move the party beyond Trump. As the cliché goes, they see him as Trump without the crazy -- a hard-edge conservative who has a gift for playing to the base's angriest, most revanchist tendencies, but isn't totally cracked.
Douthat Almost alone among the not-Trump candidates, he has a case that could actually work in a G.O.P. reshaped by Trumpism: namely, that he fought the key battles of the Trump era more effectively than Trump himself. That line may not be enough to win, but it's an argument that actually meets Republican voters where they are (or, for now, seem to be).
French He's the most likely Trump alternative in the race.
Goldberg Anti-wokeness is the glue that holds the modern right together, uniting people who disagree about economic organization or foreign policy. DeSantis -- who loves to say that Florida is "where woke goes to die" -- is betting that anti-wokeness alone can power a presidential campaign. But his official campaign launch suggests he's so far down the right-wing rabbit hole that he can't communicate with people who aren't upset about college "accreditation cartels" and central bank digital currency.
Gray DeSantis will be the clearest test so far of how much Trumpism without Trump actually appeals to voters.
Mangu-Ward In his self-published 2011 book, "Dreams From Our Founding Fathers," DeSantis writes like a normie Tea Party conservative -- and much of his record in Florida is consistent with those values, including during Covid. But the title, which tweaks Barack Obama's memoir "Dreams From My Father," is a hint that the Trumpish troll always lurked within and may be all voters care about. The DeSantis candidacy is a test of whether there is anything left of the G.O.P. besides Trump fandom.
McCarthy DeSantis is as much an heir as a rival to Donald Trump. He shows that the changes Trump began as president will continue and expand under the next generation of Republican leadership, with DeSantis at the fore. The governor is an immigration restrictionist and foreign-policy restrainer, and he's more systematic than the former president about attacking progressivism's institutional strongholds in corporate America and higher education.
Stephens DeSantis is running on the theory that the best way to beat Trump is to imitate Trump, minus the obvious personal flaws. But it might just be that the only way to beat Trump is to run directly against him, pointing out all the ways in which he has been a disaster for the Republican Party and a disgrace to the United States.
What do you find most inspiring -- or unsettling -- about his vision for America?
Brooks The modern G.O.P., like many populist-right parties across the West, is built around one idea: The progressive highly educated elites are awful; they serve themselves and condescend to everyone else. DeSantis has embraced this belief up and down the line. It's served him well politically.
Coaston His belief is that America is a problem that must be solved by the state. He appears to believe that American companies, business and schools and universities were once deserving of freedoms and liberties, but some of them have failed (in his view) and thus must be punished until they submit to the will of the state. He reminds me of Woodrow Wilson, another former governor who believed in the perfectibility of the American populace by government intervention.
Cottle He is just as thirsty for power as Trump -- and just as cruel and cynical in pursuit of that power. Fly planeloads of hapless migrants to Martha's Vineyard? Make schoolteachers pawns in his culture war? Use the levers of government to threaten and punish those who say things he dislikes? It's all good in DeSantis Land.
Douthat The thing that many of his critics loathe most about DeSantis, his willingness to use political power directly in cultural conflicts, represents the necessary future of conservatism in America. The line between politics and culture is always a blur, and a faction that enjoys political power without cultural power can't serve its own voters without looking for ways to bring those scales closer to a balance. There are good and bad ways to do this, and DeSantis's record is a mixture of the two. But the project is a normal part of democratic politics, not an authoritarian betrayal.
French Ron DeSantis has a Jekyll and Hyde persona. He ran an extremely MAGA first campaign for governor, then governed as Dr. Jekyll, squarely in the mainstream. Even his divisive Covid response was within the norms for Southern G.O.P. governors. Then, as his star rose, Mr. Hyde emerged, and he began to run to the edge of the populist G.O.P., trying to outflank Trump from the right. He's now the avatar of a more authoritarian G.O.P., eager to wield state power against his ideological enemies, often in unconstitutional ways.
Goldberg Of all the Republican candidates, DeSantis is the most likely to govern as an American Viktor Orban. He's been relentless and at times very effective -- despite his Twitter broadcast -- in using the power of the state to persecute his enemies and impose his ideology. A DeSantis presidency would represent a more orderly and disciplined kind of authoritarianism than we saw with Trump.
Gray His vision is an America under dire threat from woke teachers and Disney. He's spent his time as governor engaged in emotionally charged culture war by wielding executive power (with the assistance of a Republican legislature) -- something that raised his profile in the conservative media.
Mangu-Ward I love to hear a candidate talk about freedom, but it would be more exciting if I believed his policies would match his rhetoric. For someone who has a lot to say about liberty, DeSantis has scored his biggest hits on the national scene in an overwhelmingly authoritarian vein -- book bans, border walls, punishments for dissenting speech, restriction on the internal policies of private companies and more.
McCarthy Higher education wields enormous power over American life but is disproportionately the preserve of a single party and political outlook. DeSantis has a vision of greater representation, balance and intellectual diversity in Florida's universities, and ultimately America's. It's an inspiring vision that shifts conflict from the culture, and all its private and public institutions, back to the realm of ideas. More ideological balance on campus means more of it in corporations, journalism and beyond.
Stephens DeSantis minus the bombast could be an effective governor, never more so than when he defied conventional wisdom and required public schools to open up in the fall of 2020. But his pinched view of democracy -- whether it comes to freedom of speech, abortion rights or the importance of supporting Ukraine in its struggle for survival -- disqualifies him as someone I could think of supporting.
Imagine you're a G.O.P. operative or campaign manager. What's your elevator pitch for a DeSantis candidacy?
Brooks Many fast-growing states are run by Republicans -- Texas, Georgia, Florida. Florida has passed New York in population, Miami is becoming a tech hub, times are good. We need a president who has a record of economic success, not someone a majority of Americans have already rejected.
Coaston He's like Donald Trump with a plan.
Cottle He knows how to use theatrical jerkiness to own the libs without getting himself impeached.
Douthat He turned Florida a deeper shade of red. He knows how to govern. And nobody else who can win is walking through that door. If you don't get behind DeSantis, you might just as well get behind Trump.
French He's the only man who can unite every faction of the party. Anti-Trump or Trump-weary Republicans will vote for him despite their reservations, and he's the only other candidate who can pry the populists from Trump's grasp.
Goldberg He's still the leading Trump alternative, so if you don't want an insurrectionist loser who's fighting off felony charges, it's time to coalesce.
Gray DeSantis has shown that he can run a state that attracts hundreds of thousands of new residents while at the same time making the MAGA right feel good.
Mangu-Ward DeSantis: He's Trump, but also not Trump!
McCarthy Ron DeSantis is sternly disciplined, strikes an irresistible contrast between his own youth (44) and vigor and Joe Biden's age (80) and infirmity, and can serve two consecutive terms if elected. He's primed to be the most transformative president since Franklin Roosevelt.
Stephens To beat a creep takes an even bigger creep.

Ben Kingsley Didn't Want 'Godot' to End: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Author: Shattuck, Kathryn

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Oscar winner, now playing Salvador Dalí in "Dalíland," talks about "Waiting for Godot," D.H. Lawrence and the way Britten's "War Requiem" helps him understand history.
Ben Kingsley takes his accolades seriously. Knighted in 2002 for service to the British film industry, he prefers to be addressed as Sir Ben.
But even a knight needs his sleep, especially if he's been spending every waking hour shooting a Marvel series. No matter if it's the coronation day of King Charles III.
"I wasn't up that early but I did catch some lovely glimpses," he said, calling from Los Angeles to talk about his latest film, "Dalíland," out June 9.
Kingsley draws on a catalog of absurdist mustaches and sexual predilections to play the Spanish surrealist Salvador Dalí as he prepares for an important exhibition in 1974 while his marriage to Gala -- muse, helpmate, tormentor -- crumbles.
"It was a leap into genius that I found exhilarating and exhausting," he said. "That sublime tightrope that he walked between caring desperately about what people thought, and yet being utterly indifferent to what they thought -- that, I think, was the most challenging to portray."
Kingsley, who soared to fame with his Oscar-winning "Gandhi," likes to keep his characters varied. His latest projects include "Jules," out Aug. 11, about a small-town Pennsylvanian who gets close to an extraterrestrial, and the upcoming Disney+ "Wonder Man" series in which he's reprising Trevor Slattery, his recurring Marvel role.
And his cultural necessities change with his mood. "In other words, had you asked me two hours later, the list might have been entirely different," he said. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
'The Daughter of Auschwitz'
Tova Friedman was 5 when the Red Army liberated the prisoners from Auschwitz, and she has written this remarkable book on her childhood in Auschwitz. I spent a morning with her, and it was profoundly inspiring and humbling to be in her presence. She asked me to write the foreword to her book. My commitment to the memory of the Holocaust has come to me personally by spending such time with Simon Wiesenthal, with Elie Wiesel, with Tova Friedman and other heroic, extraordinary survivors who will, as Elie Wiesel says, tell tales of their history.
Albert Camus
I have his collection of essays, "The Myth of Sisyphus," that was given to me a very long time ago, and parts of it I still struggle to fully comprehend. The language is so dense and brilliant that I get glimpses of his universe and what he has recognized in patterns of human behavior that I, too, recognize as a portrayer. I delve into that collection time after time after time, and every time I read it I have changed. Therefore, the resonance of that passage has also changed.
'Snake'
D.H. Lawrence builds the poem dramatically about how he found a snake sipping out of his water trough and clumsily throws this lump of wood. Then he says, "I think it did not hit him." Toward the end, there's that wonderful line, "And so, I missed my chance with one of the lords of life." I read the poem at Dickie Attenborough's 80th birthday. As you know, he became Lord Attenborough. And I concluded my reading by saying, "And thank heavens I did not miss my chance."
World War I History on the Page
Many of us who live in peacetime must find the First World War utterly incomprehensible, as do we find other parts of 20th-century history. Sometimes they have to be translated musically, graphically, poetically, dramatically. I've read A.J.P. Taylor's history of the First World War. I have a monumental book at home in Oxfordshire, photographs of the First World War published in 1933, just when Hitler came into power. I'm even thinking about a film of the First World War.
World War I History in Music
Benjamin Britten's "War Requiem" made that whole horrible period of history, to me, tangible. I somehow -- and I can't put it any other way -- I felt it. That, I think, is what the artist does: allows us to feel that which we cannot comprehend. And that is the artist's great gift, to share that feeling with the tribe.
Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan
I saw him live at the Royal Albert Hall years ago, shortly before his tragic death. It was Pavarotti of all people who said the greatest voice in the world is Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's. And it is the most extraordinary voice, the range. Devotional music -- that which transcends, that which sings to and about the higher power -- it's performed with energy and magnificence, but it comes from a humble center.
'Waiting for Godot'
I performed it with the late, great Alan Howard and was directed by the late, great Sir Peter Hall, who directed the first appearance of "Godot" ever. So it was a full circle for him. To be in a rehearsal room with that power -- Beckett, Hall and Howard -- was extraordinary. It was at the Old Vic, and I didn't want the run to end. There were times onstage where I didn't know whether I was performing or in a great act of prayer.
Sergei Eisenstein
I went to a very good English school and by some wonderful stroke of fate, the head of the film society decided to show some Eisenstein films. I was utterly enthralled by the scale of them. I remember [in "Ivan the Terrible"] this endless column of human beings. Now they would say to the actor playing Ivan, "Don't worry about that, we'll CGI it." Which leaves the actor without his counterpart. It's acting in a vacuum. But some directors think they can capture the same body-chemistry change in the actor as when he's being pursued by 100,000 people. Look at the Salt March in "Gandhi." How do you think I felt at the front of it? Extraordinary. I don't think my sandals touched the ground.
Gaudí
I wondered whether Dalí would love Gaudí, both being Spanish. I've seen Gaudí architecture in Barcelona, and it is remarkable. It's as if the stone is melting, a little bit like Dalí's famous melting clock. Gaudí -- melting stone, the most beautiful curves, sensual. It's extraordinary.
'Never Take No for an Answer'
The film is about an Italian orphan called Peppino, who has a donkey called Violetta. The donkey falls very ill and he insists on going to Rome to get permission from the Holy Father, the Pope, to demolish the wall of the St. Francis chapel and let his donkey in to be blessed. I looked almost exactly like the little boy in the film and was hailed in the foyer of the cinema, mistaken for him. It left an indelible impression on me and I decided then and there, "I want to be him. I want to be Peppino."

Looking to Add Revenue, Netflix Cracks Down on Password Sharing: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The streaming company had said it was looking for ways to increase revenue. And one way was to make more people pay for the service.
The great Netflix password crackdown has begun.
The streaming giant sent out an email on Tuesday to U.S. members who are sharing their account with people living outside their household that made clear it would begin kicking people off the service if they were using someone's account for more than 30 days while at a different location.
For households willing to pay for an additional person to have access to their account, Netflix said it would charge an extra $ 7.99 per person. Otherwise, it said, it would encourage those users to sign up for an account themselves. (Netflix allows users to transfer their existing profiles to a new account to save their algorithm.)
The news was not a surprise. More than a year ago, in April 2022, the company announced its first subscriber loss in 10 years, attributing the decline, in part, to shifting economic forces as well as increased competition from other streaming services. It said at the time that it would look for ways to increase revenue, including adding a cheaper ad tier and cracking down on password sharing among households. Netflix estimated that 100 million people worldwide were accessing their streaming service without paying for it.
Netflix offers a variety of pricing options now, from $ 6.99 a month on the low end for an ad-supported version, to $ 19.99 a month on the high end for a version that doesn't include ads and allows subscribers to add two other members for an additional $ 7.99 a month, per person.
Some Netflix subscribers have taken to Twitter to voice their displeasure with the new strategy, noting that the company for years had encouraged users to share their password with others.
But that was a different time, one where Netflix reigned as the only streaming service in town. Now consumers have a plethora of choices, from Disney+ to Warner Bros. Discovery's newly launched Max to Peacock and Paramount+ and many others. And Netflix's efforts to generate more revenue per subscriber come as many consumers are feeling the economic strain from inflation.
With the new policy also occurring in the middle of the writer's strike, some influential writers were encouraging users to cancel their Netflix account in solidarity with the writers.
Still, the displeasure isn't unexpected by Netflix. The company has spent the past year testing the strategy in smaller markets like Canada, New Zealand, Spain and Portugal. It said in its most recent letter to shareholders that the initial reaction to limiting passwords is a "cancel reaction in each market" followed by "increased acquisition and revenue" after the borrowers activate their own accounts.
In Canada, where Netflix imposed the strategy in the first quarter of this year, the company wrote that "our paid membership base is now larger than prior to the launch of paid sharing and revenue growth has accelerated and is now growing faster than in the U.S."

Full text: The appeals for endorsements from lawmakers and donations from lobbyists, which were described by several people familiar with the outreach, blur the line between the governor's administration and his campaign.
As Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida begins his presidential bid, officials in his administration have solicited donations from lobbyists and endorsements from lawmakers in the state, blurring the line between his taxpayer-funded office and his political campaign.
The outreach by the governor's office, which would normally fall to Mr. DeSantis's campaign staff, was described by two people who said they were approached by administration officials and who insisted on anonymity. In at least one case, a member of Mr. DeSantis's administration sent a text message to a lobbyist with a link to his presidential fund-raising platform.
NBC News first reported the solicitations to the lobbyists.
The people who were approached discussed the conversations only on the condition of anonymity, out of fear of reprisals by the governor's office, and insisted that the government officials not be named so as to avoid revealing their own identities.
Representatives for Mr. DeSantis's office and campaign did not respond to requests for comment.
Mr. DeSantis has yet to sign Florida's $ 117 billion budget, over which he retains a line-item veto -- meaning he can, with the stroke of a pen, eliminate spending projects sought by lobbyists and legislators in Tallahassee, the capital, where he has exerted firm control over the Republican-controlled Legislature.
The outreach to lobbyists gave the impression that donations would be tracked by the governor's office, according to two people familiar with the matter.
In addition to the efforts to secure support from lobbyists, the main super PAC backing Mr. DeSantis's bid announced last week that 99 of Florida's 113 Republican state legislators had endorsed Mr. DeSantis for president. Several lawmakers said privately that they feared he might veto their bills or spending projects if they did not support him. Two said they had been contacted by members of the governor's administration about making endorsements.
As governor, Mr. DeSantis has sought to expand the power of his office and has relied on the specter of political retribution, bending legislators to do his bidding or else face primary challenges and targeting corporations like Disney that he has clashed with.
The unusual outreach to lobbyists and lawmakers highlights the careful line that Mr. DeSantis and his allies must walk as he seeks the nation's highest post while governing its third largest state.
Under Florida law, state employees are generally allowed to participate in political campaigns if they do so during their personal time, with their personal devices and without making reference to their official duties or authority, among other factors.
Ethics experts said the accounts of DeSantis administration officials' aiding his campaign merited further scrutiny -- but the members of the Florida Commission on Ethics, which looks into allegations of ethical violations by government employees, are appointed by Mr. DeSantis and his allies in the Legislature.
"The conduct raises very serious and substantial questions," said Anthony V. Alfieri, founding director of the Center for Ethics and Public Service at the University of Miami School of Law.
Juan-Carlos Planas, a Florida elections lawyer, said the governor's executive staff and political team should maintain clear boundaries.
"Government is not supposed to be overtly political," Mr. Planas said. "People have to be able to deal with the government knowing that the campaign is a separate entity. When you start blurring the line, it becomes autocratic."
Mr. DeSantis has made urgent efforts to raise money for his campaign to take on former President Donald J. Trump, who boasts an army of small donors. On Thursday, Mr. DeSantis's campaign said it had raked in a record $ 8.2 million in the first official day of his run for the White House. The remarkable dollar amount helped quiet criticism of his glitch-filled campaign announcement on Twitter a day earlier.
At least some of the haul came from Florida lobbyists. Many of the lobbyists and their clients have projects within the state budget that Mr. DeSantis could choose to veto -- giving them a clear incentive to contribute when asked. Several state lobbyists attended a daylong fund-raising session with Mr. DeSantis at the Four Seasons hotel in Miami on Thursday.
Aided by the event, which was called Ron-O-Rama, Mr. DeSantis raised roughly twice as much money as Mr. Trump did in the 24 hours after his criminal indictment this year. The sum broke the previous one-day record of $ 6.3 million set by Joseph R. Biden Jr. in 2019.
Mr. DeSantis is also under pressure to wrench key Republican endorsements away from Mr. Trump, who scored an early victory last month by securing the support of a majority of Florida Republicans in Congress.

NBCUniversal Hires Hollywood Outsider to Tamp Down the Drama: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mike Cavanagh, a veteran of the financial crisis, has just been given a leading part in the unending drama of Hollywood.
Mike Cavanagh couldn't have picked a trickier time to take over NBCUniversal.
Jeff Shell, who oversaw the media company before him, was fired after an investigation into sexual harassment. Linda Yaccarino, who ran the company's multibillion-dollar ad business, left abruptly this month to become the chief executive of Twitter.
NBCUniversal is losing billions on its streaming service, Peacock, while viewership of its traditional TV networks continues to fade. And Hollywood's writers are on strike.
But for Mr. Cavanagh, 57 -- who recently became the acting head of NBCUniversal after his promotion last year to be president of Comcast, NBCUniversal's parent company -- it may not come close to the toughest situation he has faced in his career.
In 2008, when the U.S. financial system was on the brink of failure, Mr. Cavanagh was a senior executive at JPMorgan Chase, one of the few major banks that was not at risk of collapse. He spent time alongside Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chief executive, and other executives during all-nighters to work out the details of acquiring Bear Stearns, a rival on the verge of bankruptcy.
"He's not a chest-thumper," Mr. Dimon said of Mr. Cavanagh in an interview. "He works hard, he sweats the details, and he gives a damn."
Though he has spent much of his professional career rubbing shoulders with the ultrawealthy, Mr. Cavanagh, a Long Island native and father of three, comes from a middle-class background. He spent the summer before college pumping gas at a filling station and covered expenses at Yale by working summer construction jobs.
He has become one of the few Comcast executives whom Brian Roberts, the company's chief executive, regularly consults on the most sensitive matters. Mr. Cavanagh was involved in discussions last year to combine NBCUniversal with the video game studio Electronic Arts, a deal that never came to fruition.
Comcast has not named Mr. Cavanagh as the permanent head of NBCUniversal, a media empire that includes the Universal Pictures movie studio, the NBC broadcast network, NBC News and MSNBC. But Comcast has described his job as a long-term appointment -- and he has been acting as if he plans to be in charge for the long run.
Since taking over for Mr. Shell last month, he has traveled to Los Angeles to meet with film executives, including Donna Langley, the head of Universal Studios, and Chris Meledandri, the chief executive of the animation studio Illumination. While in Los Angeles, he had dinner with Jason Blum, the horror maestro behind Universal hits like "Get Out" and "Paranormal Activity." He has also toured the "Today" show and visited the late-night hosts Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, and he is planning a tour of an NBCUniversal theme park under construction in Orlando, Fla.
In these meetings, Mr. Cavanagh has emphasized that he's not planning on making any major changes for the next few months, according to a person with knowledge of his early moves in the job. But he has had to deal with some unexpected curveballs.
Mr. Cavanagh was unaware that Ms. Yaccarino had been selected to serve as Twitter's chief executive before Elon Musk, the company's owner, announced that he had "hired a new CEO" on Twitter this month, the person said. Hours later, Mr. Cavanagh called Ms. Yaccarino from a plane to coordinate her exit and pull her from the company's annual sales pitch to advertisers. The tone of the conversation was friendly, according to a person familiar with the conversation, with Mr. Cavanagh wishing Ms. Yaccarino well and saying that he wouldn't stand in the way of her departure.
He has also had to manage the fallout from a complaint lodged by a CNBC anchor that led to Mr. Shell's dismissal. Mr. Cavanagh and Mr. Roberts fired Mr. Shell from the offices of a law firm in Philadelphia last month, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Cavanagh called senior executives at NBCUniversal the weekend Mr. Shell was fired to inform them of the change, and he met with them in person in New York afterward to reassure them that the broader vision for NBCUniversal wasn't in question.
And the writers' strike, a possibility when Mr. Cavanagh took over, has ground to a halt NBC's late-night shows, including "Saturday Night Live."
Big challenges still loom, including getting NBCUniversal's streaming business to profitability and negotiating with Disney over the future ownership of the Hulu streaming service. Also hanging over NBCUniversal is the question of whether Comcast will decide to combine it with another company, as it attempted to do last year with Electronic Arts.
Despite those concerns, Comcast, where Mr. Cavanagh remains president, has some points in its favor that perhaps give NBCUniversal some breathing room. The company's share price has increased this year, outpacing some of its peers, and it has cash-rich businesses like broadband and wireless services that offset declines elsewhere.
Though Mr. Cavanagh has been a powerful figure at Comcast for years, involved in NBCUniversal's biggest decisions, he remains a relative outsider in Hollywood. After his run at JPMorgan, he joined the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm where he was co-president. He moved to Comcast in 2015 to become its chief financial officer.
Hollywood, which runs in large part on personal relationships, can be fickle toward new arrivals and even some who have been around for many years.
Mark Shapiro, the president and chief operating officer of Endeavor, the Hollywood entertainment and sports colossus that represents NBCUniversal anchors like Rachel Maddow and Alex Wagner, said Mr. Cavanagh's profile in Hollywood could work in his favor.
"He can enter these rooms unencumbered by preconceptions and bring a fresh perspective to the industry's most pressing challenges," Mr. Shapiro said.
Mr. Cavanagh had already forged some friendships with the Hollywood executives whom NBCUniversal is closest to. Mr. Blum, the founder of the production company Blumhouse, has said he has gotten to know Mr. Cavanagh over the years, having lunch with him at Comcast's headquarters in Philadelphia to discuss Mr. Blum's ambitions for his company.
Comcast's cash-rich businesses, combined with the need to significantly expand the number of video subscribers, makes Comcast the traditional media company most likely to do the next major deal, said Craig Moffett, a senior managing director of SVB MoffettNathanson, a research firm.
"Fundamentally, that's going to be the real career-defining decision for Mike," Mr. Moffett said.

Ideological Battle Shapes Up Between Trump and DeSantis: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis are staking out conflicting positions on major issues, setting up an ideological battle that will play out over the next eight months.
Ron DeSantis is girding for battle with Donald J. Trump where he believes the former president may be most vulnerable to attack from a fellow Republican: on substance.
Mr. DeSantis, the Florida governor, is expected to make a series of policy-based arguments, according to his public statements and interviews with people who have met with him privately and described their conversations on the condition of anonymity.
He is telling Republicans that, unlike the mercurial Mr. Trump, he can be trusted to adhere to conservative principles; that Mr. Trump is too distractible and undisciplined to deliver conservative policy victories such as completing his much-hyped border wall; and that any policy promises Mr. Trump makes to conservatives are worthless because he is incapable of defeating President Biden.
Mr. DeSantis's challenge is obvious to anyone who has seen a recent poll: Mr. Trump maintains a deep psychological hold over many Republican voters who appear immune to reasoned arguments against him.
The thrice-married Mr. Trump, who stands accused of hush-money payments to women including a porn star, has never been the avatar of a social conservative. But he largely governed as one. That he was motivated more by transaction than by conviction was irrelevant to millions of evangelicals who cheered as he brought about a Supreme Court that would overturn Roe v. Wade.
But Mr. DeSantis is expected to argue that the reason Mr. Trump made so many ideologically inexplicable personnel decisions -- like elevating Dr. Anthony S. Fauci at the outset of the Covid crisis -- was because he has no fixed principles to fall back on when he faced difficult decisions.
By contrast, allies say that Mr. DeSantis will try to make the case to Republican voters that they can trust him to stand his ground on tough issues like abortion.
People who have spent time privately with Mr. DeSantis describe him as an ideologue whose happy place is a quiet room where he can read an academic journal or policy paper. Somewhat socially awkward, he peppers his conversations with references to the Constitution, the Federalist Papers and Supreme Court case law.
Mr. Trump has never been accused of citing the Federalist Papers in casual conversation. His attention span for policy is limited at best. He has powerful gut instincts on trade, immigration and some aspects of foreign policy, but in most policy areas he is open to deal-making or to the suggestions of whoever spoke to him last.
Here are five of their likeliest friction points on policy.
Abortion
Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last June, Mr. Trump has appeared uncomfortable with the consequences of his signature achievement. He privately blamed abortion hard-liners for Republicans' disappointing results in the midterm elections, has refused to say whether he would support a national abortion ban and implied Florida's new six-week abortion ban was "too harsh."
Mr. DeSantis has seized on those remarks, and his allies hope the issue helps him make inroads with the Christian right. "Protecting an unborn child when there's a detectable heartbeat is something that almost 99 percent of pro-lifers support," Mr. DeSantis said recently, noting that Mr. Trump, "as a Florida resident," hadn't said whether he would have signed "the heartbeat bill."
Still, despite supporting abortion rights for most of his adult life, Mr. Trump was the most consequential anti-abortion president in history. He reminds conservative audiences that while previous Republican presidents made plenty of promises, he was the one who ended Roe.
Taking on Big Business
Mr. DeSantis and Mr. Trump differ in their approaches to corporate America.
Mr. DeSantis subscribes to the theory, popular among the self-described "New Right," that leftists have taken over so many American institutions -- including academia, the media and big corporations -- that conservatives are fools to cede these battlefields to progressives in the name of "limited government."
Instead, Mr. DeSantis argues that conservatives must use every lever of government power to fight back -- and if that leaves traditional conservatives feeling squeamish, then so be it.
Mr. Trump has flirted with this idea but never fully bought into it. He has fought against so-called environmental, social and governance investments, railed against social media companies for their treatment of conservatives and enacted tariffs that enraged multinationals. But he also slashed taxes for corporations and invited chief executives he would later deride as "globalists" into the Oval Office and onto his business councils.
A longtime New York businessman, Mr. Trump loves, above all, to be seen cutting a deal. He sees Mr. DeSantis's fights against "woke" Disney as futile and bad for Florida's economy. He has cheered on the recent efforts by Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, to outmaneuver Mr. DeSantis.
China, Ukraine and NATO
Mr. Trump and Mr. DeSantis have split in important ways on two pivotal foreign policy questions: how to deal with China, and what role the United States should play in Ukraine's war against Russia.
Mr. Trump has been credited for prodding Republicans and Democrats into viewing China as a ruthless adversary rather than an imperfect trading partner. But for most of his presidency, Mr. Trump saw the U.S.-China relationship through a purely economic lens.
He praised President Xi Jinping of China as he chased a trade deal that he could trumpet to American farmers. He imposed tariffs on China but rejected other measures like sanctioning Chinese officials for human rights atrocities, lest that interfere with his trade deal. It was only in 2020, after Mr. Trump blamed the Chinese Communist Party for the spread of Covid, that he finally sidelined his administration's China doves and fully empowered its hawks.
Mr. DeSantis cares less about U.S.-China trade and more about the national security threats that Beijing poses. As governor, he signed a law banning Chinese social media platforms such as TikTok from state government devices and another that will stop many Chinese citizens and companies with ties to its government from buying property in Florida. Mr. Trump has promised to enact similar restrictions on Chinese investment and has called for China to pay trillions of dollars of Covid reparations, but his record suggests he will be more open than Mr. DeSantis to negotiating with Beijing.
On Ukraine, Mr. Trump has gone further than Mr. DeSantis in ruling out American support for Kyiv. While Mr. Trump called Russia's invasion a "crime against humanity" in the early days of the war, he has more recently refused to draw any moral distinction between the Ukrainians and the Russians -- saying only that a deal must be struck. He has mused about handing over chunks of Ukraine to Russia.
After dodging questions about Ukraine, Mr. DeSantis told the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson that defending Ukraine against Russia was not a vital U.S. interest and dismissed the war as a "territorial dispute." Stung by criticism, Mr. DeSantis walked back the "territorial dispute" line, and in a subsequent interview he called Mr. Putin a "war criminal." Mr. Trump refused to do the same when asked to on CNN.
While both Mr. Trump and Mr. DeSantis are contemptuous of international institutions such as the United Nations, the former president poses a more significant threat to the post-World War II international security framework.
Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, John R. Bolton, feared his boss would withdraw the United States from NATO and grew convinced he would do so if he won re-election to a second term. Now, Mr. Trump validates those fears on his campaign website, pledging to "finish the process we began under my administration of fundamentally re-evaluating NATO's purpose and NATO's mission."
Spending, Trade and the Fed
In Republican nominating contests before the age of Trump, the leading candidates tended to fight over who was more fiscally conservative -- who would abolish more federal agencies and who was more likely to reduce the federal government "to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub," as the anti-tax activist Grover Norquist put it.
But Mr. Trump has redefined the G.O.P. primary campaign into a battle over who is the most protectionist on trade, and who will most faithfully preserve government benefits for the elderly. Mr. DeSantis, who rose in politics as a Tea Party fiscal conservative, has so far shown little interest in trying to out-populist the former president on government spending and trade, and seems to hope he can reorient the party's conversation around fiscal discipline.
Mr. Trump and his super PAC have called out Mr. DeSantis's congressional votes to cut spending on Social Security and Medicare. Mr. DeSantis has said he won't "mess with" Social Security for seniors currently dependent on the program, but unlike Mr. Trump, he has not ruled out trimming entitlement spending in ways that would affect younger Americans when they retire.
Mr. Trump has initiated attacks against Mr. DeSantis for his past efforts to kill the Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires ethanol to be blended into the nation's fuel supply. Fiscal conservatives see this as "big government" overreach, but Mr. Trump knows how important ethanol is to Iowa's economy.
Mr. Trump's allies plan to portray Mr. DeSantis as "weak" on trade -- meaning he won't use tariffs as aggressively as the former president, who proudly branded himself "a tariff man" and launched trade wars with China and Europe. Mr. Trump has promised that in a second term he would introduce "a new system of universal baseline tariffs that rewards domestic production while taxing foreign companies."
Mr. DeSantis will contrast his budget surpluses in Florida to the trillions of dollars Mr. Trump added to the national debt when he was president. Mr. DeSantis will point out that as a member of Congress he voted against the trillion-dollar-plus spending bills that then-President Trump signed into law in 2017 and 2018. And Mr. DeSantis plans to tie Mr. Trump to high inflation by criticizing his appointment of Jerome H. Powell as Federal Reserve chairman.
Crime and Punishment
Mr. DeSantis has signed hard-line legislation on crime, including a law that lowers the threshold for imposing the death penalty.
Mr. Trump, who has cultivated a law-and-order persona, undercut that image in office by allowing his more liberal son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to lead bipartisan negotiations on a criminal justice law that would shorten federal prison sentences.
Mr. Trump quickly regretted signing that law, known as the First Step Act, and blamed Mr. Kushner. Privately, Mr. Trump's own advisers have acknowledged the First Step Act is a vulnerability with his political base.
Yet Mr. DeSantis's ability to directly attack Mr. Trump over the law is complicated by the fact that, along with most Republicans, he voted for the initial House version of it -- one that focused narrowly on prison reform and was opposed by civil rights groups and many Democrats. The much different version that passed, enacted when Mr. DeSantis was no longer in Congress, included sentencing reforms and the ability to apply retroactively for a reduced sentence.
The well-funded super PAC supporting Mr. DeSantis is expected to attack Mr. Trump's record on crime.
And in something of a course correction, Mr. Trump has called for imposing the death penalty for drug dealing, sending the National Guard into high-crime areas and deploying the U.S. military against Mexican drug cartels.

Full text: The Florida governor, Donald Trump's strongest challenger since 2016, made an unusual and glitch-marred entrance on Twitter alongside Elon Musk. He now faces a daunting clash with Mr. Trump and his scorched-earth tactics.
Ron DeSantis's long-awaited official entry into the 2024 presidential campaign went haywire at its start on Wednesday during a glitch-filled livestream over Twitter.
Despite the problems, Mr. DeSantis, the combative 44-year-old Republican governor of Florida who has championed conservative causes and thrown a yearslong flurry of punches at America's left, provides Donald J. Trump the most formidable Republican rival he has faced since his ascent in 2016. His candidacy comes at a pivotal moment for the Republican Party, which must choose between aligning once more behind Mr. Trump -- who lost in 2020 and continues to rage falsely about a stolen election -- or uniting around a new challenger to take on President Biden.
But on Wednesday, Mr. DeSantis's official run for the White House got off to an embarrassing start as the planned livestream with Twitter's eccentric billionaire owner, Elon Musk, was marred by technical problems and dead air. The audio cut in and out amid talk of "melting the servers," hot mic whispering and on-the-spot troubleshooting.
When, after more than 25 minutes, Mr. DeSantis finally spoke, he declared, "I am running for president of the United States to lead our great American comeback."
The extended social media hiccup -- as more than 500,000 people were waiting -- was gleefully cheered on the very platform Mr. DeSantis was supposed to be commandeering for his campaign. Donald Trump Jr. wrote a single word: "#DeSaster." Mr. Biden posted a donation button to his re-election campaign with the words, "This link works." The audience when Mr. DeSantis did deliver his remarks was smaller than it had been during the initial minutes when no one was speaking.
Despite his inauspicious start on Wednesday and having slipped well behind Mr. Trump in polls in recent months, Mr. DeSantis retains a host of strengths: a mountain of cash, a robust campaign operation and a series of conservative policy victories in Florida after a landslide re-election triumph last fall. The governor, who rose to national prominence with his restriction-averse handling of the coronavirus pandemic, argues that his "Florida Blueprint" can be a model for reshaping the United States in a starkly conservative mold, especially on social issues.
"American decline is not inevitable," Mr. DeSantis said. "It is a choice. And we should choose a new direction, a path that will lead to American revitalization." He accused Mr. Biden of taking "his cues from the woke mob."
Mr. DeSantis did not mention Mr. Trump by name. But he did sketch out some of the contrasts he is expected to sharpen in the coming months. "We must look forward, not backwards," he said on the Twitter Space livestream. "We need the courage to lead and we must have the strength to win."
The DeSantis campaign had invited prominent donors to Miami on Wednesday for a fund-raising event, hosting them at a conference space at the Four Seasons as the Twitter discussion was projected onto a large screen. Then they waited. And waited.
"Elon's got to staff up a little more to boost that server capacity," said Brandon Rosner, a donor from Milwaukee. He was not discouraged. "Once we got through the original glitch there, I think people were very excited," he said.
Mr. DeSantis is confronting the daunting endeavor of toppling a former president whose belligerence and loyal base of support have discouraged most leading Republicans from making frontal attacks against him. Mr. Trump, who has a mounting list of legal troubles, clearly sees Mr. DeSantis as a political threat and has unloaded on him for months, mocking him as "Ron DeSanctimonious" and slamming his stewardship of Florida.
"Trump is not as invincible as he once seemed and DeSantis is a serious contender," said Mike Murphy, a veteran Republican strategist. "There are Republican voters looking for someone who can move beyond Trump, someone who can fight the liberals but also win elections. That's the space DeSantis is trying to inhabit."
Mr. DeSantis's chances of capturing the nomination may depend on whether the Republican primary becomes a crowded, Trump-dominated food fight -- something similar to what unfolded in 2016 -- or if he can turn the contest into a two-man race. The Republican field has slowly ballooned, with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina announcing a bid this week and Vice President Mike Pence expected to join soon.
To winnow the field back down, Mr. DeSantis is likely to need strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two nominating states, with anti-Trump voters coalescing around him. His advisers and allies see a victory in socially conservative Iowa as a must, and believe he needs to follow with at least a close second-place finish in more moderate New Hampshire.
Mr. DeSantis has the financial ammunition to compete: He is likely to start with more money in an outside group than any Republican primary candidate in history. He has more than $ 80 million expected to be transferred from his state account to his super PAC, which says it has also raised $ 40 million, in addition to having tens of millions more in donor commitments, according to people familiar with the fund-raising.
A key focus of the primary, and the general election should Mr. DeSantis make it that far, will be his record as governor. He and a pliant Florida Legislature have passed contentious laws that have excited the right and angered many Democrats, including Black and L.G.B.T.Q. people, students and abortion-rights supporters in Florida. The bills seem to reflect Mr. DeSantis's plan to run to the right of Mr. Trump in the primary, which could leave him vulnerable with moderates and independents.
In the most recent legislative session alone, Florida Republicans banned abortion after six weeks of pregnancy; expanded the use of the death penalty; allowed Floridians to carry concealed guns without a permit; restricted gender-transition care for minors; limited teaching about gender identity and sexual orientation; defunded diversity, equity and inclusion programs at public colleges; and shielded records of his own scrutinized travel from the public.
Mr. DeSantis has also shown a willingness to use executive power in ways little seen before in Tallahassee, the state capital, leading some Democrats and civil rights leaders to worry that he shares Mr. Trump's strongman style but has a greater ability to carry out that vision.
He has picked a long-running fight with Disney, one of Florida's largest employers and a canny political adversary. He removed a local prosecutor from office in what records show was a decision motivated by politics, installed his allies at a public liberal arts university in a bid to transform it into a bastion of conservative thought, said he would reject a high school Advanced Placement course on African American studies for "indoctrinating" students and had state law enforcement officers monitor holiday drag shows for lewd behavior.
While his stump speech focuses on a lengthy recounting of those and other conservative policy achievements, Mr. DeSantis is expected to start talking more about his biography, with help from his wife, Casey DeSantis, a former television journalist who plays an influential role in his office and decision-making.
Raised in Dunedin, a suburb of Tampa, Mr. DeSantis grew up in a working-class home. He excelled at baseball, captaining the squad at Yale University as a hard-hitting outfielder.
He later enrolled at Harvard Law School, then served in the Navy as a military lawyer, deploying to Guantánamo Bay and Iraq. He worked as a federal prosecutor in Florida before winning election to Congress in 2012. He was a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of anti-establishment conservatives.
After three terms in Washington, he ran for Florida's open governorship, winning the Republican primary largely thanks to an endorsement from Mr. Trump. But they fell out when Mr. DeSantis began making noises about running for president in 2024.
The pandemic turned Mr. DeSantis into a Fox News fixture. He has criticized social distancing measures, masks and vaccines -- tools fitfully employed by the Trump administration -- and has already hinted that he will contrast his actions in Florida with Mr. Trump's approach. In particular, Mr. DeSantis has gone after Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, who led the nation's pandemic response.
But the step-up from a statewide campaign, even one as successful as Mr. DeSantis's nearly 20-percentage-point romp, to a presidential campaign is not easy. As the initial Twitter Space floundered on Wednesday, Mr. Musk was forced to post a new link, severely reducing the audience for Mr. DeSantis's announcement.
While more than 500,000 people tuned in to the first Twitter Space, the second one had only 163,000 listeners by the time Mr. Musk and the technology entrepreneur David Sacks began interviewing the governor. The conversation quickly turned into a surprisingly dry discussion about the overreach of federal agencies, the merits of Twitter and occasionally bizarre tangents like the license plate number of Representative Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who has endorsed Mr. DeSantis and joined the online conversation.
Mr. DeSantis's campaign tried to put a positive spin on the technical mishaps, writing on Twitter: "It seems we broke the internet with so much excitement." An aide announced they had raised $ 1 million in an hour. All the while, Mr. Trump's team rejoiced. "This is criminal for a campaign," said Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to the former president.
Mr. DeSantis had waited months to declare his candidacy, citing a need for Florida's Legislature to first complete its session in early May. The delay allowed Mr. Trump to test out attacks on Mr. DeSantis and secure the endorsement of numerous members of Congress, including several from Florida.
As Mr. DeSantis ramped up his presidential preparations this year with a book tour and a trip abroad, he has seemed to struggle at points.
Awkward moments -- including cringeworthy facial expressions -- generated negative headlines. So did some poorly calculated policy pronouncements, particularly his declaration that defending Ukraine from the Russian invasion was not a vital U.S. interest. Some major donors who once saw him as the most suitable Trump challenger backed away.
At the heart of the criticism is the perception that Mr. DeSantis, a supreme believer in his own abilities, can seem aloof and quick to anger. Even his allies acknowledge he is not the backslapping, baby-kissing type -- concerns he has tried to address by spending more time greeting voters and taking selfies.
"He is an introvert in an extrovert's job," said Alex Andrade, a Republican state representative from the Florida Panhandle who says he admires the governor's reserved and analytical approach.
In recent weeks, Mr. DeSantis has seemed to recover from his wobbles, hitting back with more force against Mr. Trump. He has criticized the former president for not endorsing Florida's six-week abortion ban and has described a "culture of losing" overtaking the Republican Party under Mr. Trump. He also told donors in a private call that Mr. Trump could not beat Mr. Biden.
In the Twitter event, Mr. DeSantis took some sideswipes at the former president, a onetime reality television star, at one point saying, "Government is not entertainment. It's not about building a brand or virtue-signaling."
As they wrapped up the hourlong conversation, which meandered from Article 2 of the Constitution to Bitcoin, Mr. DeSantis said, "We should do it again. I mean, I think it was fun."
Mr. Sacks concurred. "It's not how you start," he added, "it's how you finish."

Full text: Smith, a rising young composer, has adapted her work "Lost Coast" into a cello concerto premiering this week at the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
In 2014, the composer Gabriella Smith took a hike through the Lost Coast in Northern California. Populated by bears, mountain lions and Roosevelt elk, it's an area so rugged that the scenic Highway 1, which runs along the water, has to detour far inland. She kept a tide log on hand for portions of the trail that follow the shore. "You have to be careful," she said, "not to be swept away."
The wildness surprised her. "I felt so much awe being there," Smith said. And she liked the sound of the name: the poetry of the words "lost" and "coast" together, the multiple meanings it suggests. It was, as John Adams, one of her mentors, would say, a title in search of a piece.
She wrote a cello solo with looping electronics for Gabriel Cabezas, a friend and former classmate at the Curtis Institute of Music, inspired by the image of a trail being repeatedly washed away. Then the piece transformed into a more complex, layered recording, released in 2021. And now "Lost Coast" is taking on yet another life, its grandest yet: a cello concerto, premiering on Thursday with Cabezas and the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
This work and its trajectory are a lot like Smith's career. At 31, she prefers to write for people she has a relationship with, even as she receives increasingly prominent commissions. Here and elsewhere, her music, in addition to its fascination with the natural world, exudes inventiveness with a welcoming personality, rousing energy and torrents of joy -- not to mention an infectious groove.
"I always assume," Cabezas said, "that anybody who listens to her music will be her next biggest fan."
Growing up in Berkeley, Calif., Smith studied piano and violin, and at 8 -- even earlier, if you ask her mother -- began to write music of her own to figure out how it all worked. But she kept it secret, convinced that what she was doing was strange, even embarrassing. She didn't know anyone else like her.
It took encouragement, as well as music theory lessons, from her teacher at the time to keep going. Smith was inspired by the composers whose works she was learning: Mozart, Bach, Haydn. Her own pieces, though, didn't resemble theirs, if only because, she said, "I didn't know how to sound like that."
Once, she wrote what she thought was a Mozartean duo for violin and piano, until she heard two classmates play it. "But that," Smith said, "encouraged me, because it was this puzzle to figure out how to make the idea match the result."
Other influences entered her brain, mainly Bartok and Joni Mitchell. And she received a boost from Adams. He remembered a quiet teenager who arrived at his house with a "staggering" number of pieces, all polished with plastic spiral binding. "I was impressed," he said, "that she obviously had this incredible determination at a young age."
Smith wasn't just determined in music. She also loved nature and became interested in environmental issues around the age she started composing. At 12, she started volunteering at a research station in Point Reyes; the people there told her that they had never been approached by someone so young, but they gave her a try. For the next five years, she banded birds and bonded with local biologists. She even got her mother on board.
At 17, she started at Curtis in Philadelphia but missed the West Coast. "I was so homesick," she said, "that it sort of forced me to reckon with not only who I was as a composer, but as a person. I infused all that into the music, and that's when my music started to sound like me."
Smith is soft-spoken. But as a composer "she fills up the whole room," said the violist Nadia Sirota, who has performed her music and collaborated with her and Cabezas as a producer on the "Lost Coast" album. "She knows exactly what she's talking about. And when someone has clear ideas, it's just about realizing them."
As Smith continued to write, Adams clocked that her sound was quickly maturing. He saw a sensitivity to the natural world that, he said, "goes all the way back to the 'Pastoral' Symphony." And he could tell that, for performers and audiences alike, it would be fun. Cabezas has certainly felt that way: "You don't lose a sense of what music should be, but at the same time there's optimism, quirkiness and humor."
In "Tumblebird Contrails," a piece that Adams and Deborah O'Grady, his wife, commissioned through their Pacific Harmony Foundation, a Point Reyes hike is translated into music of muscularity, amazement and delight. Similar adjectives come to mind for other scores, such as the quartet "Carrot Revolution," an immediately engrossing work of pure excitement.
These feelings, Smith said, come naturally: "I try to put in all the emotions, but joy is the one I care most about. It's the joy that I experience from the natural world and, honestly, the joy of making music."
Smith's titles tend toward the playful. Sometimes they can seem nonsensical, like "Imaginary Pancake," a piano solo written for Timo Andres. But that was inspired by a memory from a childhood summer music program where she was impressed by an older boy who was playing something with his arms stretched to both ends of a keyboard. She asked him what it was, and he said Beethoven.
As an adult, she tried to find that music but couldn't; she realized that her memory had exaggerated it until it became something else. So she composed based on the inspiration of an imaginary piece. And "pancake"? That's the image of a player leaning over the keyboard with arms outstretched, flat like a pancake.

Now living in Seattle, Smith remains involved in environmentalism. She bikes instead of drives, and is working on an ecological restoration at a former Navy airfield. There is some anger about the state of climate change in her music, like the song "Bard of a Wasteland," but even then the rhythms suggest underlying optimism. "It's so easy to slip into despair," she said, "but there are all these people around us working on this in incredibly joyful ways. We need to feel the things we need to feel and grieve the things we need to grieve. Then we need to go on."
There is determination, too, alongside awe in "Lost Coast." The album version was made in Iceland, over multiple sessions that layered Cabezas's playing with a few contributions by Sirota and singing by Smith, based on her compositional method of recording herself on Ableton software. "She creates music in space," Sirota said. "It's almost like she's molding clay."
For the concerto version, Smith adapted her singing into more traditional lines for winds and brasses. But it wasn't a one-to-one transfer; many sections were heavily changed, and she also added a cadenza. "There are some wild parts that she rewrote," Cabezas said. "It fits the orchestral aesthetic a little more, and she's found some places where that works even better."
Smith wants to further integrate the environmental and musical sides of her life. Her next piece -- for the Kronos Quartet's 50th anniversary, with a preview coming to Carnegie Hall in November ahead of its full premiere in January -- will include interviews she made with others working on climate solutions. But she is still figuring out how to do more.
"I can write music, but that feels like the first step," she said. "A lot of it feels like uncharted territory. But everybody, in every field, needs to do this."

MIAMI — Ron DeSantis’ long-awaited official entry into the 2024 presidential campaign went haywire at its start Wednesday during a glitch-filled livestream over Twitter.
Despite the problems, DeSantis, the combative 44-year-old Republican governor of Florida who has championed conservative causes and thrown a yearslong flurry of punches at America’s left, provides Donald Trump the most formidable Republican rival he has faced since his ascent in 2016. His candidacy comes at a pivotal moment for the Republican Party, which must choose between aligning once more behind Trump — who lost in 2020 and continues to rage falsely about a stolen election — or uniting around a new challenger to take on President Joe Biden.
But on Wednesday, DeSantis’ official run for the White House got off to an embarrassing start as the planned livestream with Twitter’s eccentric billionaire owner, Elon Musk, was marred by technical problems and dead air. The audio cut in and out amid talk of “melting the servers,” hot mic whispering and on-the-spot troubleshooting.
When, after more than 25 minutes, DeSantis finally spoke, he declared, “I am running for president of the United States to lead our great American comeback.”
The extended social media hiccup — as more than 500,000 people were waiting — was gleefully cheered on the very platform DeSantis was supposed to be commandeering for his campaign. Donald Trump Jr. wrote a single word: “#DeSaster.” Biden posted a donation button to his reelection campaign with the words, “This link works.” The audience when DeSantis did deliver his remarks was smaller than it had been during the initial minutes when no one was speaking.
Despite the inauspicious start Wednesday and having slipped well behind Trump in polls in recent months, DeSantis retains a host of strengths: a mountain of cash, a robust campaign operation and a series of conservative policy victories in Florida after a landslide reelection triumph last fall. The governor, who rose to national prominence with his restriction-averse handling of the coronavirus pandemic, argues that his “Florida Blueprint” can be a model for reshaping the United States in a starkly conservative mold, especially on social issues.
“American decline is not inevitable,” DeSantis said. “It is a choice. And we should choose a new direction, a path that will lead to American revitalization.” He accused Biden of taking “his cues from the woke mob.”
DeSantis did not mention Trump by name. But he did sketch out some of the contrasts he is expected to sharpen in the coming months. “We must look forward, not backwards,” he said on the Twitter Space livestream. “We need the courage to lead and we must have the strength to win.”
The DeSantis campaign had invited prominent donors to Miami on Wednesday for a fundraising event, hosting them at a conference space at the Four Seasons as the Twitter discussion was projected onto a large screen. Then they waited. And waited.
“Elon’s got to staff up a little more to boost that server capacity,” said Brandon Rosner, a donor from Milwaukee. He was not discouraged. “Once we got through the original glitch there, I think people were very excited,” he said.
DeSantis is confronting the daunting endeavor of toppling a former president whose belligerence and loyal base of support have discouraged most leading Republicans from making frontal attacks against him. Trump, who has a mounting list of legal troubles, clearly sees DeSantis as a political threat and has unloaded on him for months, mocking him as “Ron DeSanctimonious” and slamming his stewardship of Florida.
“Trump is not as invincible as he once seemed and DeSantis is a serious contender,” said Mike Murphy, a veteran Republican strategist. “There are Republican voters looking for someone who can move beyond Trump, someone who can fight the liberals but also win elections. That’s the space DeSantis is trying to inhabit.”
DeSantis’ chances of capturing the nomination may depend on whether the Republican primary becomes a crowded, Trump-dominated food fight — something similar to what unfolded in 2016 — or if he can turn the contest into a two-man race. The Republican field has slowly ballooned, with Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina announcing a bid this week and Vice President Mike Pence expected to join soon.
To winnow the field back down, DeSantis is likely to need strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two nominating states, with anti-Trump voters coalescing around him. His advisers and allies see a victory in socially conservative Iowa as a must, and believe he needs to follow with at least a close second-place finish in more moderate New Hampshire.
DeSantis has the financial ammunition to compete: He is likely to start with more money in an outside group than any Republican primary candidate in history. He has more than $80 million expected to be transferred from his state account to his super PAC, which says it has also raised $40 million, in addition to having tens of millions more in donor commitments, according to people familiar with the fundraising.
A key focus of the primary, and the general election should DeSantis make it that far, will be his record as governor. He and a pliant Florida Legislature have passed contentious laws that have excited the right and angered many Democrats, including Black and LGBTQ people, students and abortion-rights supporters in Florida. The bills seem to reflect DeSantis’ plan to run to the right of Trump in the primary, which could leave him vulnerable with moderates and independents.
In the most recent legislative session alone, Florida Republicans banned abortion after six weeks of pregnancy; expanded the use of the death penalty; allowed Floridians to carry concealed guns without a permit; restricted gender-transition care for minors; limited teaching about gender identity and sexual orientation; defunded diversity, equity and inclusion programs at public colleges; and shielded records of his own scrutinized travel from the public.
DeSantis has also shown a willingness to use executive power in ways little seen before in Tallahassee, the state capital, leading some Democrats and civil rights leaders to worry that he shares Trump’s strongman style but has a greater ability to carry out that vision.
He has picked a long-running fight with The Walt Disney Co., one of Florida’s largest employers and a canny political adversary. He removed a local prosecutor from office in what records show was a decision motivated by politics, installed his allies at a public liberal arts university in a bid to transform it into a bastion of conservative thought, said he would reject a high school Advanced Placement course on African American studies for “indoctrinating” students, and had state law enforcement officers monitor holiday drag shows for lewd behavior.
While his stump speech focuses on a lengthy recounting of those and other conservative policy achievements, DeSantis is expected to start talking more about his biography, with help from his wife, Casey DeSantis, a former television journalist who plays an influential role in his office and decision-making.
Raised in Dunedin, a suburb of Tampa, Ron DeSantis grew up in a working-class home. He excelled at baseball, captaining the squad at Yale University as a hard-hitting outfielder.
He later enrolled at Harvard Law School, then served in the Navy as a military lawyer, deploying to Guantánamo Bay and Iraq. He worked as a federal prosecutor in Florida before winning election to Congress in 2012. He was a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of anti-establishment conservatives.
After three terms in Washington, he ran for Florida’s open governorship, winning the Republican primary largely thanks to an endorsement from Trump. But they fell out when DeSantis began making noises about running for president in 2024.
The pandemic turned DeSantis into a Fox News fixture. He has criticized social distancing measures, masks and vaccines — tools fitfully employed by the Trump administration — and has already hinted that he will contrast his actions in Florida with Trump’s approach. In particular, DeSantis has gone after Dr. Anthony Fauci, who led the nation’s pandemic response.
But the step-up from a statewide campaign, even one as successful as DeSantis’ nearly 20-percentage-point romp, to a presidential campaign is not easy. As the initial Twitter Space floundered Wednesday, Musk was forced to post a new link, severely reducing the audience for DeSantis’ announcement.
While more than 500,000 people tuned in to the first Twitter Space, the second one had only 163,000 listeners by the time Musk and technology entrepreneur David Sacks began interviewing the governor. The conversation quickly turned into a surprisingly dry discussion about the overreach of federal agencies, the merits of Twitter and occasionally bizarre tangents like the license plate number of Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who has endorsed DeSantis and joined the online conversation.
DeSantis’ campaign tried to put a positive spin on the technical mishaps, writing on Twitter: “It seems we broke the internet with so much excitement.” An aide announced they had raised $1 million in an hour. All the while, Trump’s team rejoiced. “This is criminal for a campaign,” said Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to the former president.
DeSantis had waited months to declare his candidacy, citing a need for Florida’s Legislature to first complete its session in early May. The delay allowed Trump to test out attacks on DeSantis and secure the endorsement of numerous members of Congress, including several from Florida.
As DeSantis ramped up his presidential preparations this year with a book tour and a trip abroad, he has seemed to struggle at points.
Awkward moments — including cringeworthy facial expressions — generated negative headlines. So did some poorly calculated policy pronouncements, particularly his declaration that defending Ukraine from the Russian invasion was not a vital U.S. interest. Some major donors who once saw him as the most suitable Trump challenger backed away.
At the heart of the criticism is the perception that DeSantis, a supreme believer in his own abilities, can seem aloof and quick to anger. Even his allies acknowledge he is not the backslapping, baby-kissing type — concerns he has tried to address by spending more time greeting voters and taking selfies.
“He is an introvert in an extrovert’s job,” said Alex Andrade, a Republican state representative from the Florida Panhandle who says he admires the governor’s reserved and analytical approach.
In recent weeks, DeSantis has seemed to recover from his wobbles, hitting back with more force against Trump. He has criticized the former president for not endorsing Florida’s six-week abortion ban and has described a “culture of losing” overtaking the Republican Party under Trump. He also told donors in a private call that Trump could not beat Biden.
In the Twitter event, DeSantis took some sideswipes at the former president, a onetime reality television star, at one point saying, “Government is not entertainment. It’s not about building a brand or virtue-signaling.”
As they wrapped up the hourlong conversation, which meandered from Article 2 of the Constitution to bitcoin, DeSantis said, “We should do it again. I mean, I think it was fun.”
Sacks concurred. “It’s not how you start,” he added, “it’s how you finish.”

A Smiling Soul-Crusher Has the Heat One Win From the Finals: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Butler has shaped the Miami Heat in his no-quit, self-assured image, which is bad news for a reeling Boston team that is one loss from elimination in the Eastern Conference finals.
MIAMI -- For much of Game 3 of the N.B.A.'s Eastern Conference finals on Sunday, Jimmy Butler did something he does not often do: He played a supporting role. He created off the dribble, zipped passes to his Heat teammates for open shots and pushed to score only when the opportunity made too much sense not to seize it.
Butler could have easily tried to take over against the reeling Boston Celtics. But he has shaped the Heat in his no-quit, self-assured image, and empowered their cast of unsung players to lead. Then, shortly before halftime on Sunday, as if anyone needed to be reminded of his presence, Butler dribbled the ball upcourt and went straight at the Celtics' Grant Williams, his latest nemesis, for a jumper off the glass.
After drawing a foul on the shot for good measure, Butler fell to his back and stayed there for longer than was necessary -- just so he could point at Williams and make it clear that he had made him look foolish, again.
"In all the moments of truth," Heat Coach Erik Spoelstra said, "Jimmy is going to put his will on the game."
Another game, another clinic given by Miami, whose 128-102 victory on Sunday was an end-to-end drubbing. The Heat, who have a 3-0 series lead, will go for the sweep at home on Tuesday, driven by their increasingly credible championship dreams as an eighth seed.
The Celtics' Jaylen Brown called the Game 3 loss "embarrassing." Boston Coach Joe Mazzulla took the blame. "I just didn't have them ready to play," he said.
All things considered, it was a muted performance by Butler, who finished with 16 points, 8 rebounds and 6 assists. But for the first time in the series, he faced traps. Both he and Bam Adebayo found teammates who were willing to help. Gabe Vincent scored 29 points, and Duncan Robinson finished with 22.
"Jimmy and Bam are fueling that," Spoelstra said. "They are just infusing those guys with confidence."
It would be easy to describe Butler as a showman, as someone who turns the court into a stage. He is not an impassive person. He emotes. He interacts with opposing players. He sings to himself. And he seems to delight in those moments (plural) when a crowded arena awaits his next act.
Make no mistake: There is a theatrical element to his approach, especially in the playoffs. It was on full display in Game 2 on Friday, after Williams connected on a 3-pointer to build on Boston's narrow lead midway through the fourth quarter. Williams began jawing with Butler on his way back up the court. On the ensuing possession, Butler scored on Williams and drew a foul. Afterward, Butler and Williams knocked foreheads as they continued their -- how to put this delicately? -- conversation.
"l like that," Butler said. "I'm all for that. It makes me key in a lot more. It pushes that will that I have to win a lot more. It makes me smile. When people talk to me, I'm like, OK, I know I'm a decent player if you want to talk to me out of everybody that you can talk to."
For Williams, talking to Butler was a miscalculation. The Heat closed that game with a 24-9 run. After the win, Butler strode to his news conference crooning along to "Somebody's Problem," a song by the country artist Morgan Wallen, which Butler was playing on his iPhone.
"It's a hit in the locker room right now," said Butler, who described himself as the team D.J. "So I get to pick and choose what we listen to."
The thing about Butler, though, is that all his extracurriculars -- and all the attention that he draws to himself, whether intentional or not -- are a means to an end. They motivate him, push him to perform. He is not brash for the sake of being brash. He is brash because being brash helps him win.
"He loves to win," said Mike Marquis, who was his coach at Tyler Junior College, a two-year school about 100 miles southeast of Dallas. "Some people hate to lose. He absolutely loves to win. I think sometimes there's a negative connotation with hating to lose, with bad sportsmanship and all that. But when I coached him, he didn't have any of that -- he just loved to win."
Butler, who had a difficult childhood, was not highly recruited coming out of Tomball High School in Texas. He had a scholarship offer from Centenary, a small college in Louisiana that has since transitioned to Division III, and a partial offer from Quinnipiac. But Tyler, Butler said, was where he felt wanted.
Joe Fulce, a teammate of his at Tyler and later at Marquette, recalled that Butler had an uncanny ability to "curate his own world" whenever he played basketball. Outside the gym, there were problems and challenges. Inside the gym, the many distractions of his daily life somehow ceased to exist.
"That's hard as hell to do," Fulce said. "It's almost like he was a magician."
Marquis caught another glimpse of that single-minded focus when the N.B.A. concluded its 2019-20 season inside a spectator-free bubble at Walt Disney World because of the coronavirus pandemic. While other players were going stir crazy, Butler thrived in that sort of insulated environment, hauling the fifth-seeded Heat to the N.B.A. finals before they lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in six games.
Today, Butler is one of the league's most recognizable players and a global pitchman for a low-calorie beer. But he still finds a way to close himself off from the world around him whenever he plays basketball, and he is not all that dissimilar to many of his teammates who were overlooked until they found success in Miami. The Heat have nine undrafted players on their roster, including Vincent and Robinson.
Butler went to junior college. He was the final pick of the first round of the 2011 N.B.A. draft. Even this season, he was not selected as an All-Star (which, in hindsight, was probably an oversight). The veteran guard Kyle Lowry has said Butler is one of the most unselfish stars he has played with.
"He is us, and we are him," Spoelstra told reporters earlier in the postseason, as a way of explaining the synergy between Butler and the team around him. "Sometimes, the psychotic meets the psychotic."
Together, they are one win from the N.B.A. finals.
Photograph "In all the moments of truth, Jimmy is going to put his will on the game," Miami Coach Erik Spoelstra said of Jimmy Butler (22), who had 16 points in a Game 3 victory Sunday. A confrontation Friday with Grant Williams, near left, seemed to motivate Butler.

Office Workers Don't Hate the Office. They Hate the Commute.: [Op-Ed]

Author: Manjoo, Farhad

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Elon Musk says we should all get off our duffs and go back to the office. People who want to work from home aren't just "phoning it in" from "some remote pseudo-office" as he's put it. Now he says we're immoral, too.
"The whole notion of work from home is a bit like the fake Marie Antoinette quote 'Let them eat cake,"' Musk told CNBC this week. Factory workers, service workers and construction workers can't work from home, so why do people in the "laptop classes" think they should be able to do so? "It's not just a productivity thing," he said. "I think it's morally wrong."
A cynic might note that factory workers can't work from private jets, either, yet Musk's commitment to worker equity didn't prevent his plane from making a reported 171 trips last year. A cynic might also point out that a man who makes cars for a living has a stake in the perpetuation of Americans driving to and from work day after day.
But I'm not so cynical. Musk isn't alone among corporate executives in seeing employees' reluctance to return to the office as a genuine economic problem. Mark Zuckerberg of Meta, Bob Iger of Disney, Andy Jassy of Amazon, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and others have been pleading with or arm-twisting workers to come back. Companies have tried carrots -- redesigning offices -- and they've tried sticks, like reversing remote work policies at the same time they announce huge layoffs. But in a tight labor market, the office has been a tough sell. The average office occupancy rate across 10 major cities has plateaued at around 50 percent, The Wall Street Journal reported this week, citing data from Kastle Systems. Remote work seems to be turning from a pandemic necessity into a permanent feature of the American workplace.
Is this a big problem? For some local economies, it could be shattering, but I'll get to that in a bit. First let's address why folks aren't coming back and why they probably won't unless we fix a big problem with office work that few C.E.O.s seem to mention: getting to and getting home from the office. Survey after survey bears this out. If we want people to go to the office more often, we have to do something about the daily commute, a ritual of American life that's time-consuming, emotionally taxing, environmentally toxic and expensive.
In 2019 the average one-way commute in the United States hit a record of almost 28 minutes, according to the Census Bureau. Nearly 40 percent of Americans commuted a half-hour or more, one way, and almost 10 percent traveled for more than an hour one way.
For many, the pandemic-era shift to remote work proved that all the schlepping was unnecessary. They can't unsee all the wasted time, and questioning their morality isn't going to change that. They aren't taking a moral stance; they're just making a rational calculation: They can get a lot more done -- in their work lives and in the rest of their lives -- if they skip the commute.
Liberty Street Economics, a blog that features writing from New York Fed analysts, reported last year that collectively, Americans now spend 60 million fewer hours per day traveling to work. That's 60 million hours for which they weren't being compensated that they can now spend exercising, taking care of their children, getting a bit more sleep and starting their workday earlier or ending it later.
Workers are delighted by the switch. According to a survey by the Conference Board, overall job satisfaction in 2022 was at just over 62 percent, a high not seen in decades, and people with hybrid jobs that allowed them to work at home and at a job site were the happiest. A working paper published last year by the National Bureau of Economic Research even found that the rise of remote work "lessens wage-growth pressures and (modestly) eases the challenge facing monetary policymakers in their efforts to bring inflation down without stalling the economy."
What about workers' productivity? Has working from home led to a lot of slacking off? Not obviously. Another N.B.E.R. working paper published last year found that among workers at a large tech company, hybrid work arrangements did not significantly affect workers' productivity even though people worked slightly less on days they were at home and slightly more on days they were in the office. Hybrid work improved job satisfaction measures and reduced attrition by 33 percent, especially among those with the longest commutes.
So what's the downside to remote work? It might be hurting cities. Many of America's largest and most prosperous urban areas rely on the rhythms of the daily commute; the perpetual need for morning caffeine, sad desk salads at lunch and beer gardens at happy hour boosts downtown and office-park economies.
The shift to remote work abruptly disrupted this pattern, setting off what has been called an apocalypse in the market for office real estate and, for some cities, a death spiral for public transportation systems -- things that can contribute to a cycle that further damages economies. (I embrace the soft pants revolution as much as the next person, but imagine running a downtown mom-and-pop dry cleaning service over the past three years.)
But if potential urban ruination is the danger, it isn't a problem for C.E.O.s to solve -- at least not by grumbling about their lazy workers. Rather, it's a problem of infrastructure and policy; it's a problem for local, state and national governments to address through long-range planning and a more realistic approach to urban development.
Like what? In theory, we know how to do this. If people are sick of commuting to work, we could aim to make commuting much less of a hassle. The ways to do that would likely involve some combination of reducing the distance between people's homes and offices, improving the modes of transportation along these routes and reducing the other costs of going to work -- by providing more accessible and affordable child care, for example.
If it sounds as though I'm using the shift to remote work as an opportunity to advocate lefty urbanist pipe dreams -- better public transit! Fewer cars and more bikes! Denser development! An improved social safety net! -- you're right. I am.
But what are the alternatives? Digging tunnels for underground freeways or a hyperloop? Self-driving taxis that ferry us around so that we can work while we commute? Converting conference rooms to dank sleeping pods so that people can just live at the office all the time?
These are some of Musk's ideas for the future of work and life. Do they seem more realistic -- or more desirable -- than simply building more livable cities and better ways for people to get to work? Or is all this another way of saying, "Let them take robotaxis"?

Full text: The executive hosted sessions about race and being a white woman that were titled "Don't Call Me Karen," prompting an employee uproar.
Uber has placed its longtime head of diversity, equity and inclusion on leave after workers complained that an employee event she moderated, titled "Don't Call Me Karen," was insensitive to people of color.
Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber's chief executive, and Nikki Krishnamurthy, the chief people officer, last week asked Bo Young Lee, the head of diversity, "to step back and take a leave of absence while we determine next steps," according to an email on Thursday from Ms. Krishnamurthy to some employees that was viewed by The New York Times.
"We have heard that many of you are in pain and upset by yesterday's Moving Forward session," the email said. "While it was meant to be a dialogue, it's obvious that those who attended did not feel heard."
Employees' concerns centered on a pair of events, one last month and another last Wednesday, that were billed as "diving into the spectrum of the American white woman's experience" and hearing from white women who work at Uber, with a focus on "the 'Karen' persona." They were intended to be an "open and honest conversation about race," according to the invitation.
But workers instead felt that they were being lectured on the difficulties experienced by white women and why "Karen" was a derogatory term and that Ms. Lee was dismissive of their concerns, according to messages sent on Slack, a workplace messaging tool, that were viewed by The Times.
The term Karen has become slang for a white woman with a sense of entitlement who often complains to a manager and reports Black people and other racial minorities to the authorities. Employees felt the event organizers were minimizing racism and the harm white people can inflict on people of color by focusing on how "Karen" is a hurtful word, according to the messages and an employee who attended the events. A prominent "Karen" incident occurred in 2020, when Amy Cooper, a white woman, called 911 after a Black man bird-watching in New York's Central Park asked her to leash her dog.
The concerns raised about the events underscored the difficulties that companies face as they navigate subjects of race and identity that have become increasingly hot-button issues in Silicon Valley and beyond. Cultural clashes over race and L.G.B.T.Q. rights have been thrust to the forefront of workplaces in recent years, including the renewed attention to discrimination in company hiring practices and the feud between Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida and Disney over a state law that limits classroom instruction about gender identity and sexual orientation.
At Uber, the incident was also a rare case of employee dissent under Mr. Khosrowshahi, who has shepherded the company away from the aggressive, chaotic culture that pervaded under the former chief executive, Travis Kalanick. Mr. Khosrowshahi's efforts included increased diversity initiatives under Ms. Lee, who has led the effort since 2018. Before joining Uber, she held similar roles at the financial services firm Marsh McLennan and other companies, according to her LinkedIn profile.
"I can confirm that Bo is currently on a leave of absence," Noah Edwardsen, an Uber spokesman, said in a statement. Ms. Lee did not respond to a request for comment.
The first of the two Don't Call Me Karen events, in April, was part of a series called Moving Forward -- discussions about race and the experiences of underrepresented groups that sprung up in the aftermath of the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.
Several weeks after that first event, a Black woman asked during an Uber all-hands meeting how the company would prevent "tone-deaf, offensive and triggering conversations" from becoming a part of its diversity initiatives.
Ms. Lee fielded the question, arguing that the Moving Forward series was aimed at having tough conversations and not intended to be comfortable.
"Sometimes being pushed out of your own strategic ignorance is the right thing to do," she said, according to notes taken by an employee who attended the event. The comment prompted more employee outrage and complaints to executives, according to the Slack messages and the employee.
The second of the two events, run by Ms. Lee, was intended to be a dialogue where workers discussed what they had heard in the earlier meeting.
But in Slack groups for Black and Hispanic employees at Uber, workers fumed that instead of a chance to provide feedback or have a dialogue, they were instead being lectured about their response to the initial Don't Call Me Karen event.
"I felt like I was being scolded for the entirety of that meeting," one employee wrote.
Another employee took issue with the premise that the term Karen shouldn't be used.
"I think when people are called Karens it's implied that this is someone that has little empathy to others or is bothered by minorities others that don't look like them. Like why can't bad behavior not be called out?" she wrote.
Employees greeted the news that Ms. Lee was stepping away as a sign that Uber's leadership was taking their complaints seriously.
One employee wrote that the company's executives "have heard us, they know we are hurting, and they want to understand what all happened too."

Classical Crescendo: [Op-Ed]

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The orgasm heard around the world was reported by Magnus Fiennes, a composer and music producer who is the brother of Ralph Fiennes. After going to the Los Angeles Philharmonic in April, he tweeted about a woman sitting near him at Walt Disney Concert Hall who had a "loud and full body orgasm" during the second movement of Tchaikovsky's Fifth.
Some in the audience tweeted back, wondering if the moaning was due to a medical condition. But the woman, who stayed with her smiling partner for the whole concert, has not come forward to clear it up.
Whatever happened, the scream is a metaphor. As we discuss which musical genres are expiring -- Is rock 'n' roll dead, as Jann Wenner told me? Is jazz fading away? -- it seems that classical music is getting hotter.
Albert Imperato, a New York music promoter, says the idea is breaking through that classical music is not supposed to be safe and relaxing. It's supposed to tingle.
"Let's not forget that the word 'climax' is a common musical term," the soprano Renée Fleming told me. "It has to do with musical tension and its release." She said Rachmaninoff and Liszt "had it down" when it comes to sexy pieces.
To celebrate the scream, Norman Lebrecht, a British music journalist, ran "The 10 Best Orgasm Symphonies" in his blog, Slipped Disc.
Elim Chan, the 36-year-old conductor with the baton that night, told me she watched the woman in her peripheral vision until she "calmed down." She said she likes when audience members audibly react -- "I don't want to be a piece of museum art." We recalled how "Fantasia" and Bugs Bunny excited us as children, with their flights of classical music.
After the dark years of Covid and everyone at home streaming, she said, people are coming out to concerts to "feel something" that will exist only in that time -- "and if you miss it, you miss it."
The scream reminded me of the golden era in Hollywood, when moguls put their biggest stars -- Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, Elizabeth Taylor, Ingrid Bergman -- into passionate tales about classical musicians. There has been a revival of that recently, with Cate Blanchett in "Tár," Kelvin Harrison Jr. in "Chevalier" and the upcoming Netflix movie "Maestro," with Bradley Cooper as Leonard Bernstein.
Several recent surveys have clocked a rise in the popularity of classical music in the last couple of years. In America and England, the genre flourished during the pandemic, drawing more women and younger listeners, and it's soaring among content creators on social media.
"Maybe that old orchestral and operatic music now sounds fresh to ears raised on electronic sounds," the music critic Ted Gioia mused on his Substack, or "maybe young people view getting dressed up for a night at the opera hall as a kind of cosplay event."
Peter Gelb, the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, agreed. "The average age of our audience used to be in the 60s; now it's in the 40s," he told me.
He said that new operas by living composers -- Terence Blanchard's "Fire Shut Up in My Bones" and "Champion" and Kevin Puts's "The Hours" -- are big draws. Gelb said that "Champion," based on the life of Emile Griffith, a bisexual boxer, is the first time the Met has featured two men kissing or drag queens.
New York is the epicenter of the electricity. Cue Dudamania. Gustavo Dudamel, the 42-year-old curly-haired conductor who looks for "blood" in the music, is moving from Los Angeles to take over the New York Philharmonic in 2026. He promised to "keep that wild, wild animal Gustavo," giving audiences a preview this weekend at David Geffen Hall, conducting Mahler's Ninth.
At the Met, the 48-year-old conductor Yannick Nézet-Séguin is a bolt of lightning with bleached-blond hair and a diamond earring. In elaborate costumes inspired by whatever opera he is conducting, he shakes off classical music's conservative air.
Keri-Lynn Wilson, the six-foot glamazon who conducts in black Armani pantsuits with her ponytail swinging -- and who is part of a classical music power couple with her husband, Peter Gelb -- sparkled in her debut at the Met last fall with Shostakovich's "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk."
"I actually conducted an orgasm in it," she said about the climactic sex scene. "Shostakovich achieved it through the sequencing of a relentlessly building and sliding trombone lick in unison with the entire orchestra in a pulsating crescendo." She said Stalin banned the work and Shostakovich narrowly avoided the gulag.
New York is also home to Yuja Wang, the 36-year-old pianist who wears high-fashion miniskirts and stilettos for her bravura performances of Rachmaninoff.
Nézet-Séguin told me he thinks we are "beginning another golden age for our art form."
"Without accusing anyone," he said, he believes "institutions and maybe artists forgot some aspects of our art form" and "maybe the connection with the audience was just not enough of a priority, in my opinion."
He said that in rehearsals, he always tells the orchestra to explore the love. "'Love every note. Love more your eighth notes. Please love this harmony more.' It's very connected to classical music being sexy."

Justice Long Denied, Ensured by Prosecutors: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In March of 1989, I spent two days sitting in a Dallas courthouse among a group of journalists watching justice being blocked.
Randall Dale Adams, who had served 12 years for the murder of a police officer, had been granted a new trial by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. This was a year after the filmmaker Errol Morris essentially proved that he was innocent -- and that another man, who confessed to the murder on film in Mr. Morris's documentary "The Thin Blue Line," was guilty.
In a damning ruling, the appeals court accepted the findings of a lower court that Dallas County prosecutors had suppressed evidence favorable to Mr. Adams, deceived the court on the whereabouts of a witness and knowingly used perjured testimony. But prosecutors were still disinclined to let Mr. Adams go.
At a bail hearing, they played games for two days with the court, demanding that the sitting judge be removed from the case, requiring a second judge to fly in from Waco, Texas, only for the court to rule that the first judge could in fact stay. Then the district attorney, John Vance, argued for bail that Mr. Adams could not afford nor probably raise.
"I don't think Randall Dale Adams ought to be out on the street," he said of the man his office had railroaded.
Nearly 36 hours after the hearing began, Mr. Adams finally left the building on bail, pending a new trial, after his conviction had been overturned. I have kept a photo of the moment across from my desk for nearly 35 years. Wearing borrowed clothes as he walked to a waiting car, his hands held out in front of him as if still in handcuffs, Mr. Adams was asked by one of the sea of reporters and photographers how it felt to be back in the world.
"I'm not out of Dallas yet," he said, and seemed to walk faster.
I thought of Mr. Adams often as I kept track of the recent news from Tallahassee, Fla., where the lawyer for Leo Schofield, 57, stood before a room packed with spectators at a parole hearing two weeks ago. Many of those spectators vehemently believed him innocent of the 1987 murder of his wife, Michelle.
The thread that connects the two men is the apparent unwillingness of their prosecutors, despite new evidence, to accept even the possibility that the men they convicted were innocent.
Like Mr. Adams, Mr. Schofield had spent much of a lifetime -- 35 years in his case -- trying to regain his freedom. As in the Adams case, there was new evidence discovered: Fingerprints that were not tested for 17 years turned out to belong to a man who has been convicted of murder, and that man has confessed to Michelle Schofield's murder. As in the Adams case, it took an outsider to bring Mr. Schofield's case attention, the Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist Gilbert King, whose nine-part podcast, "Bone Valley," has been downloaded more than six million times.
Most of all, as in the Adams case, the district attorney's office, this time in Polk County, Fla., spent years fighting Mr. Schofield's release. At a parole hearing, a few years ago, the state was represented by a former prosecutor who appeared to take the case personally.
"We investigated this thing upside down," said Jerry Hill, a retired state attorney, in a "Bone Valley" interview with Mr. King's co-host, Kelsey Decker, minutes after the board denied parole to Mr. Schofield in 2020. "Leo Schofield is a coldblooded murderer. And if I have my way, he'll never get out of prison."
"The past is obdurate. It doesn't want to change," Stephen King wrote in his opus "11/22/63." That could have been describing the scene in either Dallas or Tallahassee. As Mr. King's central character in "11/22/63," a time traveler, gets closer to preventing the assassination of John Kennedy, the past throws ever larger obstacles in his way. And so it went in the Adams and Schofield cases, as the prosecutors all but physically barred the jailhouse door.
Much has changed in the American judicial system since Randall Dale Adams walked out of that Dallas jail. For some prosecutors, exoneration has become a point of pride -- a sign that the prosecutorial machinery is confident enough to review its own work and admit mistakes. Conviction integrity units, also called conviction review units, are particularly robust in some cities, including Detroit and Philadelphia, said Barbara O'Brien, a professor at Michigan State University College of Law. Ms. O'Brien is also editor of the National Registry of Exonerations, which since its founding in 2012 has reported more than 3,000 exonerations that have taken place since 1989, including more than 230 in 2022 alone.
Where prosecutors are not re-evaluating their own convictions, a layer of what Ms. O'Brien calls "professional exonerators" has grown up -- groups like the Innocence Project, law school clinics and lawyers working on cases pro bono.
But there are still prosecutors who won't admit they were wrong, even in the face of substantial evidence. There was no expression of regret from the prosecutors who convicted Randall Dale Adams in Dallas. Nor does one seem likely from the Polk County district attorney's office, where any defense of Leo Schofield appears to have been seen by its prosecutors as an attempt to subvert the jury's decision and, by extension, justice.
"It happens less, because back awhile you would regularly see where it was a small town and the state attorney could be the cousin of the sheriff, and who they decided was guilty, was guilty," said Herman Lindsey, executive director of Witness to Innocence, which provides assistance to exonerated death row inmates. (Mr. Lindsey himself spent three years on death row before the Florida Supreme Court concluded the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction. He is one of 30 death row inmates in Florida to be exonerated since 1972, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.)
But these wrongful convictions still happen, and not every prosecutor is willing to reconsider a conviction. "While yes, there are more prosecutors willing to be proven wrong, there are still those who show an almost Disney-villain level" of not budging, Ms. O'Brien said, adding that "the Schofield case is beyond the pale, one of the worst I have seen."
How to explain this stubborn insistence on guilt despite what others perceive as proof of innocence or, at least, enough evidence to warrant another look?
Ms. O'Brien blames "the fact that we have an adversarial system rather than an inquisitorial one," meaning that the court does not take part in investigating the facts but is rather assumed to be an impartial forum in which the prosecution and the defense present their opposing arguments. It can attract people who "see things as very black and white, there's good guys and bad guys, where the goal is the win rather than the truth," she said.
In other words, it takes absolute certainty to go to work every day and send people to prison for up to a lifetime. And certainty is tricky to surrender. Allowing for the probability that you were wrong once allows for the possibility that you have been wrong often, and opening that door is often unthinkable.
Scott Cupp has seen how prosecutors learn to shut the mental gates against doubt. He was a prosecutor in Florida for 17 years. "I put a lot of folks in prison," he said, adding, "but before I did, I made damn sure I was right." Several times during his tenure, he said, he was presented evidence that he had the wrong person and faced reluctance among some of his prosecutors to drop the charges, "but we ended up doing so -- it's called doing your job," he said.
Then Mr. Cupp became a defense lawyer. In fact, he was Mr. Schofield's lawyer off and on until he was offered a position as a judge on the 20th Judicial Circuit Court in Charlotte County, Fla., in 2014. The case haunted him while on the bench, and when he heard Gilbert King speak at an event in Naples, Fla., in 2018, he told the reporter to go read the case transcript because his client was "not just wrongly convicted. He's an innocent man." In March, Mr. Cupp stepped down from his position on the court to defend Mr. Schofield again, full-time and free.
"The system is made up of human beings, and human beings are flawed," he said. "In this case, you add a relatively small town where law enforcement and prosecution is a big fish in a little pond. It's ego pure and simple."
When there is progress in such "small ponds," therefore, it can be incremental. Hints of such an evolution, however glacial, were visible in the room at the latest Schofield parole hearing, Mr. Cupp said. (Parole has been abolished in Florida, one of 16 states to do so, but because that happened after Mr. Schofield was sentenced, he is still entitled to parole.) The room was filled with journalists and sympathetic spectators.
This time, it was Jacob Orr, an assistant state attorney in the 10th Judicial Circuit, who stood to speak; he had not been involved in the original prosecution. "If we thought that Leo Schofield, or any other inmate, was innocent, we would take immediate action to right that injustice," he told The New York Times in January. "However, the state cannot ignore the overwhelming amount of evidence that has proven Leo Schofield guilty."
But at the hearing he appeared to pivot a bit. While his predecessors had called Mr. Schofield names, handed grisly autopsy photos of Michelle Schofield to the panel members and argued Mr. Schofield should not be released because he refused to express remorse, Mr. Orr simply asked that "you treat this inmate the same as any other," in determining whether to grant parole.
And so they did. Longtime prisoners in Florida are routinely required to spend a year or two in a unit designed to prepare them for life in the world, and though the panel denied the request for parole, it did order Mr. Schofield to spend 12 months in a transition program at the Everglades Correctional Institution near Miami. Successful completion of the program is likely to result in his release at his next parole hearing in one year.
Perhaps then he will be able to live a quiet life, as Mr. Adams did after his release. When Mr. Adams died in 2010, at age 61, he had spent a fifth of his life in prison and had come within three days of being executed for a crime he did not commit.
Mr. Schofield, who has spent two-thirds of his life in prison for a crime another man says he committed, should have been sent to the lifers program "in 2020 when Jerry Hill came and insisted Leo would die in prison instead," Mr. Cupp said. But better now than never, he added.
News reports after the hearing "described it as a negative thing, denied parole, and that's factually correct," Mr. Cupp said. "But there were positive things that came out of it. The state attorney's office clearly signaled that they were backing off."
Finally.

A Generation Named for Connie Chung: [Letter]

Full text: To the Editor:
Re "I Got My Name From Connie Chung. So Did They," by Connie Wang (Opinion guest essay, May 14), about the many Asian women named after the TV journalist:
It feels strange to know that there are so many Asian Connies out there, all close in age range in our 30s and 40s. But it's a good strange feeling. It feels as if I have serendipitously entered a vast sisterhood, where the profound bond among us was formed by the influence of one woman on our mothers over 30 years ago.
In my family, watching Connie Chung host "CBS Evening News" in the early '90s was a family event. There were barely any Asian faces on TV at the time, let alone on a major news program. Connie Chung stood out in every way.
"You can't be what you can't see." When Ms. Chung came on the screen, my mom saw what was possible for the next generation right in front of her, far from the sights of Asian women working in menial jobs that defined my mom's day-to-day life as a new immigrant.
So when I suggested Connie as my English name, my mother liked it right away. "Keep it. It's good, it's just like Connie Chung," she would say. With that choice of a name, my mom had poured all her hopes for me. Little did I know then that across the country people were being named Connie for that very same reason.
Times are different now. There is a lot more diversity in the media and other professions. While we still have much work ahead of us, let us take a moment to celebrate this progress.

To the Editor:
My daughter was adopted from Guangdong Province, China, in 1998 when she was 13 months old. She has no memory of the following story except through my retelling.
It was a spring afternoon in the year 2000 at the Museum of Life and Science in Durham, N.C. My toddler and I took our places on the open-air train for a ride through the grounds.
"It's who you think it is," the ticket taker whispered, nodding over her shoulder. Two seats ahead, surrounded by visitors, were Maury Povich and Connie Chung.
Celebrity watching prevailed over scenery and animal sighting during that ride. Afterward, as a cluster of visitors lingered with Mr. Povich, Ms. Chung strolled ahead alone. But not for long. My daughter, rarely more than an inch from my side, leery of all strangers, let go of my hand and trotted up to grab Connie's leg. Surprised, smiling, Ms. Chung lifted my daughter into her arms.
Connie Wang's wonderful article describes the surprise that Ms. Chung expressed when told: "There are so many of us out here. Named after you." Something about that surprise, of not knowing her effect on others, stays with me.

The Dangerous Debt Limit Debate
To the Editor:
Re "Ignoring the Debt Limit Would Be Dangerous" (Opinion guest essay, May 15):
I disagree with my longtime friend Michael McConnell about the politics of the debt ceiling.
Of course Congress has the power of the purse. But the problem here is not Congress as a whole; it is a slim majority in the House. And that majority is controlled by a handful of its most extreme members.
The debt ceiling debate is certainly not politics as usual. It is a threat to destroy the country's finances and its position of world leadership unless the Senate and the president give in to that faction's extreme demands.
Neither the country nor the Constitution can function if every choke point in the system of checks and balances is exploited for maximum leverage without regard to consequences. If one side is willing to wreck the economy unless it gets its way, why not both sides? If one faction, why not many different factions with inconsistent demands?
The House, the Senate and the president bargain over spending in the budget and appropriations process, not through threats to destroy the economy if I don't get my way.

Ron DeSantis, Authoritarian
To the Editor:
The efforts by Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida to harass Disney for exercising its rights of free speech and to ban books from the classroom that do not support his political or racial beliefs are the mark of an authoritarian tyrant. They show that right-wing politicians are the perpetrators, not the victims, of "cancel culture."
Republicans should consider how they would react if a Democratic governor retaliated against a corporation for opposing a Democratic program or embarked upon a program to ban conservative books.
This is not the sort of person who belongs anywhere near the White House, and this is not the sort of person whom anyone should support. Hard to believe that Mr. DeSantis attended two fine academic institutions -- Yale and Harvard Law -- and learned so little about free speech, democracy and American constitutional values.

Forming a Community With Homeless Neighbors
To the Editor:
"In New York City, Making the Invisible Visible" (The Story Behind the Story, May 7) yields a question: To what extent is the mental illness we see in homeless people the result of -- not the cause of -- their being homeless?
Hundreds of people silently pass them by each day, turning away, ignoring a hand held out for a donation. In plain sight, day after day, they live in public solitary confinement, the sort that is now being attacked in the courts as an inhumane, cruel and unusual punishment that often leads to mental illness when used in prisons.
A civic organization I belong to in Florida recently began refurbishing a public park, long known as the home of the homeless in our city, by organizing periodic cleanups by volunteers and painting a mural honoring a local eccentric woman, long dead.
After a while, the homeless folks began approaching our volunteers and the painter, viewing the art and then striking up tentative conversations. One homeless woman turned out to be an amateur painter, and a small portion of the mural was turned over to her to design and paint.
Within weeks, the homeless frequenting the park began policing it -- picking up trash and chastising people who dropped it. And, most important, collectively and individually, some bizarre behaviors faded away, replaced by social interaction.
I now wonder what the results would be if the public at large began acknowledging the homeless, even by saying, "Hello," or "I don't have any cash with me today, sorry," rather than simply walking on.
As someone who lived in New York City for 30 years, I know that the city is filled with visible-yet-invisible people and am, frankly, ashamed that I didn't catch onto this notion earlier.

U.S. Role in Sex Exploitation in South Korea
To the Editor:
Re "South Korea Created a Brutal Sex Trade for American Soldiers" (front page, May 3):
As your article so painfully makes clear, the brutal forced prostitution of young and vulnerable South Korean women and girls was caused not just by the government of South Korea but by the United States as well.
There is much that the U.S. can and should do. It should be paying reparations. The government and the armed services chiefs should offer apologies to the women who went through this and to their families.
And those who are in charge of curbing sexual harassment in the military today should redouble their efforts as they grow to understand just how systemic sexual assaults and misogyny have been in the armed forces for so long.

To the Editor:
The efforts by Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida to harass Disney for exercising its rights of free speech and to ban books from the classroom that do not support his political or racial beliefs are the mark of an authoritarian tyrant. They show that right-wing politicians are the perpetrators, not the victims, of "cancel culture."
Republicans should consider how they would react if a Democratic governor retaliated against a corporation for opposing a Democratic program or embarked upon a program to ban conservative books.
This is not the sort of person who belongs anywhere near the White House, and this is not the sort of person whom anyone should support. Hard to believe that Mr. DeSantis attended two fine academic institutions -- Yale and Harvard Law -- and learned so little about free speech, democracy and American constitutional values.

Is This the Year the Nuggets Finally Pan Out in the Postseason?: [Sports Desk]

Full text: Denver is unraveling its reputation for playoff disappointment one win at a time.
The Denver Nuggets have spent the past few months hearing that they weren't to be trusted in the playoffs, that Nikola Jokic, a two-time most valuable player, couldn't lead them to postseason success, that their record, the best in the Western Conference for most of the season, was some kind of mirage.
Nobody was scared of them in the playoffs, or so the narrative went.
But in the first two rounds of the playoffs this year, the Nuggets had defied their reputation of fading in the postseason by easily dispatching Minnesota and Phoenix. They seemed to be doing the same to the Lakers on Tuesday night, as they dominated for most of Game 1 of the Western Conference finals. But as the second half wore on, Denver left room for doubts about their playoff toughness to creep back in.
Fair or not, what's at stake for the Nuggets in this series, which they lead, 1-0, after a 132-126 win on Tuesday, is their ability to prove that their elite play is not an illusion that disappears in May.
"We're a long ways away from what we're trying to do," Nuggets Coach Michael Malone told his team in the locker room after the game.
The Nuggets have never been to the N.B.A. finals, and they haven't competed in a championship round since their last season in the American Basketball Association, in 1975-76. Most of that disappointing history can't be blamed on their current group.
But even now, something happens year after year to prevent the Nuggets from competing for a title, and they have been blamed for that.
Jokic has been an All-Star for the past five seasons, but Denver has been to the conference finals only once in that time, in 2020. The Nuggets lost to the Lakers in five games that year, which played out at a closed site at Disney World in Florida because of the coronavirus pandemic. They fell out of the postseason even sooner in each of the next two years without their talented point guard Jamal Murray, who tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee about a month before the 2021 playoffs.
Then this season's Nuggets started to look unbeatable.
They were in or tied for first place in the West from Dec. 20 through the end of the season. Jokic had another M.V.P.-caliber year, though he lost the award to Philadelphia's Joel Embiid. Murray was resurgent after a year and a half spent recovering from his knee injury. The Nuggets won 75 percent of their games in January and February.
Perhaps it was their lackluster effort in March, when the Nuggets were 7-7, that convinced observers that they weren't as dominant as a top seed should be. Or perhaps they were just being punished by public opinion for past playoff performances.
They seem ready to change the conversation this time, though they claim to ignore it.
They cruised past the Timberwolves, then humiliated the Suns in the second round with a 25-point win in the series-clinching Game 6.
"I guess I don't know how a championship team looks," Jokic said after the series, "but I think that's how it's supposed to look. We were so focused on every detail."
But now the matchup against the Lakers has evoked memories of a Denver team these Nuggets don't want to look like: the one that lost to the Lakers in the conference finals in 2020, the last time they met in the playoffs. Now both teams are almost entirely different except for the stars: Jokic and Murray for the Nuggets and LeBron James and Anthony Davis for the Lakers. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, a key role player for the Lakers in 2020, is now a key role player for the Nuggets.
They are all older, for better or worse. Before, the Lakers were driven by James's play. Now, Davis's role matters much more than it used to.
For two and a half quarters of Tuesday's game, this year's Lakers seemed to be no match for this year's Nuggets, and skepticism about Denver's championship aspirations felt silly.
Denver scored 72 points and led by 18 at halftime. Jokic already had 19 points, 16 rebounds and 7 assists.
"It took us a half to get into the game," James said. "That was pretty much the ballgame right there."
In the Lakers' previous series this postseason, against Memphis and Golden State, Davis's mere presence scared opponents out of the paint. That wouldn't happen against the Nuggets. For much of the game, Davis was chained to Jokic in a way that prevented him from being the force he had been against the Warriors.
The Lakers hadn't played someone like Jokic yet in the playoffs, in part because there is no one quite like him -- a big man who passes as effortlessly as he scores. It's why Lakers Coach Darvin Ham had jokingly suggested on Monday that perhaps the only way they could stop Jokic was to kidnap him.
Midway through the third quarter Jokic had already notched a triple-double.
Then, to stop a Lakers' run late in the third quarter, he hit an off-center, step-back 3 at the buzzer, with a smothering Davis waving his arms. Davis left the court wearing a wry smile. He'd done all he could and it still wasn't enough to stop Jokic.
Jokic finished with 34 points, 21 rebounds and 14 assists. Davis had 40 points and 10 rebounds.
In the Nuggets' locker room after the game, Malone addressed his team with pride and caution. Good win, he said in comments aired on ESPN, but also: Play better defense.
Ham hinted that he hadn't shown all of his potential adjustments in Game 1. Malone said that he would rather fix mistakes after a win than after a loss.
What will ultimately matter more for legitimizing the Denver Nuggets as a championship threat is not how they win these games, but that they do.

Bill Saluga, 85, the Comedic Wiseguy You Can Call Ray, or Jay, or Johnny ...: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He played many characters in his career, but he was best known by far for the one who said, "You doesn't have to call me Johnson."
Raymond J. Johnson Jr. was a wiseguy, dressed in a zoot suit and a wide-brimmed fedora and waving a cigar in his right hand.
When someone mentioned his name, the shtick took off.
"Ohhhh, you doesn't have to call me Johnson," he would say. "My name is Raymond J. Johnson Jr. Now, you can call me Ray, or you can call me Jay, or you can call me Johnny, or you can call me Sonny, or you can call me Junie, or you can call me Ray Jay, or you can call me R.J. Or you can call me R.J.J. Or you can call me R.J.J. Jr.
"But you doesn't have to call me Johnson."
And you can call his creator Bill Saluga. A diminutive comedian with a thick mustache, he came up with Johnson while a member of the Ace Trucking Company, an improvisational sketch troupe whose most famous alumnus is Fred Willard. Mr. Saluga also played Johnson on various television series; on a disco record ("Dancin' Johnson"); and, most memorably, in commercials for Anheuser-Busch's Natural Light beer.
In 1979, at the peak of Mr. Saluga's fame as a comedic one-hit wonder, Tom Shales of The Washington Post wrote that "now everybody and his brother are doing Saluga impressions throughout this very impressionable land of ours."
He added, "He's right up there with Steve Martin's wild and crazy guy and Robin Williams's madcap Mork."
Bob Dylan played off Mr. Saluga's Johnsonian wordplay, and his own name change, in his 1979 song "Gotta Serve Somebody." He sang, in part:
You may call me Terry, you may call me Timmy
You may call me Bobby, you may call me Zimmy
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray
You may call me anything but no matter what you say
You're gonna have to serve somebody
Mr. Saluga died of cardiopulmonary arrest on March 28 in a hospice in Los Angeles, his nephew, Scott Saluga, said. He was 85 and had been living in Burbank, Calif.
The Tribune Chronicle, a newspaper in Warren, Ohio, near Youngstown, where Mr. Saluga was born, first reported his death on April 8. But it did not become widely known until Hollywood trade publications published obituaries this month.
William Saluga was born on Sept. 16, 1937. When Billy, as his friends called him, was 10, his father, Joseph, was killed in an accident while working at the Republic Steel mill, and his mother, Helen (Yavorsky) Saluga, started working as a bookkeeper.
Billy was a class clown and a cheerleader in high school. After two years in the Navy, he became a performer. In the early and mid-1960s he was seen on a local TV station, with a sketch comedy group called the Thimble Theater, and at the Youngstown Playhouse, where, for seven years, he played roles in numerous productions, including "Inherit the Wind" and "Guys and Dolls."
In 1968, Mr. Saluga became the talent coordinator for the comedian Steve Allen's interview and entertainment TV show. "If you have a special or unusual talent," a newspaper ad for the show read, "television needs you. Call Bill Saluga. 469-9011."
After replacing a member of the Ace Trucking Company, he created the Johnson character in 1969 during a man-on-the-street sketch with Mr. Willard at the Bitter End in Greenwich Village. It became part of the troupe's repertoire until he left in 1976. By then, the group had made many appearances on "The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson."
Mr. Saluga appeared from 1976 to 1977 on the comedian Redd Foxx's variety show and a comedy and variety series hosted by the comedian David Steinberg, playing Raymond J. Johnson on both. For the Steinberg show, he also portrayed a New York street guy named Vinnie de Milo.
"Billy was always doing Ray J.," Mr. Steinberg said by email. "He was relentless with it. I would say, 'Mr. Johnson,' and Billy would be off." He added: "He did it everywhere. At parties. His timing and delivery were so funny every time."
The character, with a delivery based in part on the con man Kingfish from the sitcom "Amos 'n Andy," appealed to Anheuser-Busch, which hoped to use him to distinguish Natural Light from a rival beer, Miller Lite. In 1978, the company teamed Mr. Saluga with Norm Crosby, the malaprop comedian, for a commercial set in a bar.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
When a customer asks for an Anheuser-Busch Natural Light, Mr. Crosby counsels him to say, "Just say 'Natural,"' which propels Mr. Saluga to say: "See, you doesn't have to call it Anheuser-Busch Natural Light. And you doesn't have to call it Anheuser Natural. And you doesn't have to call it Busch Natural. Just say 'Natural."' And when Mr. Crosby says, "Johnson's right," Mr. Saluga says, "Ohhhh, you can call me Ray or you can call me Jay. ... "
The pair would go on to do a second spot. Eric Brenner, a friend of Mr. Saluga's, said in a phone interview that Mr. Saluga had earned significant money in residuals from the two commercials, probably the most he made in his career.
For the next 40 years, he took regular acting jobs -- including as a hostile ticket taker at an opera house in a 1992 episode of "Seinfeld" and Louis Lewis, the comedian Richard Lewis's fictional cousin, in three episodes of "Curb Your Enthusiasm" in 2005. He also reprised Raymond J. Johnson on the animated TV series "The Simpsons" (2002) and "King of the Hill" (2010).
"He played outrageous characters onstage, but offstage he was very reserved," said Bill Minkin, a friend and fellow comedian. "It was that Midwest down-home thing."
No immediate family members survive.
Mr. Saluga did not mind being known primarily as Raymond J. Johnson. In fact, he said, it gave him an agreeable anonymity when he stepped out of character.
"I would sit in restaurants and hear the people behind me in the booth talking about me, and I was right there," he said on "Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast" in 2017. "They didn't know who I was, which was great."

The Annual Holy Pilgrimage to Cannes: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wes Anderson, Martin Scorsese and Todd Haynes have works premiering this year at the festival on the French Riviera.
Wes Anderson's films have premiered at a wide variety of festivals, but after "Moonrise Kingdom" (2012), "The French Dispatch" (2021) and his upcoming ensemble comedy "Asteroid City," Cannes is the fest he keeps coming back to. Last week, I asked Anderson what he finds so compelling about a debut on the Croisette.
"The reason to go to Cannes, I think, is because they said yes," he deadpanned. "After that, there isn't really much to contemplate."
Well, there's a little more to it than that, Anderson admitted: For cinema lovers, there is no holier pilgrimage to make than to the Cannes Film Festival, where movies are treated with the utmost reverence and routinely given marathon standing ovations.
It is a place where great auteurs have been canonized, like Martin Scorsese, who won the Palme d'Or in 1976 for "Taxi Driver" and will return this year with his new feature "Killers of the Flower Moon," and Quentin Tarantino, a Palme winner (for "Pulp Fiction" in 1994) and Cannes habitué who'll be back at the fest this year for a wide-ranging conversation that may touch on his upcoming final film.
"I look at Cannes in relation to the other movies I know showed there, and I feel lucky enough to be included in the program that debuted those films," Anderson said. "For me, it's a chance to be involved in this movie history, which I love."
A Cannes launch can be awfully expensive for a studio to bankroll, since the airfare, star entourages and five-star hotels alone all add up. Still, the return on investment can be major. Last year, "Top Gun: Maverick" launched with a fawning Tom Cruise summit and sent fighter jets flying over the south of France, while Baz Luhrmann's "Elvis" threw a rock concert on the beach where drones traced Elvis Presley's silhouette in the sky. Both films leveraged their splashy debuts to become some of the best-performing global hits of the year, and were nominated for the best-picture Oscar, to boot.
This year, several star-driven films will attempt to capitalize on a Cannes bow, including "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny," which is being billed as Harrison Ford's final appearance in his most iconic role. Can it overcome the tepid response to the last sequel, "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull," and the substitution of James Mangold ("Ford v Ferrari") for Steven Spielberg as director of the series? At least the addition of Phoebe Waller-Bridge, in her most high-profile role since "Fleabag," will add a welcome jolt to the franchise.
The director Todd Haynes, who premiered "Carol" at Cannes, returns to the festival with another female-driven two-hander: "May December," which stars Julianne Moore as a teacher whose scandalous relationship with a former student is scrutinized by a movie star (Natalie Portman) preparing to play the teacher in a film. Other star-heavy films include "The New Boy," featuring Cate Blanchett as a nun in her first role since "Tár," and "Firebrand," with Jude Law as Henry VIII and Alicia Vikander as his last wife, Katherine Parr.
And then there are "Asteroid City" and "Killers of the Flower Moon," the fest's two most anticipated premieres. The former takes place at a 1950s retreat for space-obsessed youngsters and stars Anderson staples like Jason Schwartzman, Scarlett Johansson and Tilda Swinton, as well as new recruit Tom Hanks, about whom Anderson said, "I couldn't have had a better time working with anybody." Scorsese's Apple-backed film charts the mysterious murders of the Osage tribe in the 1920s and will bring stars like Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro to the red carpet.
(Still, weep for what might have been: Greta Gerwig's candy-colored July release "Barbie" will skip an early premiere at Cannes, depriving us of a red-carpet fantasy to trump all others.)
In recent years, the winner of the prestigious Palme d'Or award has often gone to a film with breakout-hit potential, like "Parasite" and "Triangle of Sadness." The director of the latter film, Ruben Ostlund, will preside over this year's competition jury, a group that includes Brie Larson and Paul Dano, and they'll be picking their favorite from an auteur-heavy lineup that includes several former Palme winners.
Among them are Wim Wenders, who took the Palme for "Paris, Texas" and returns with "Perfect Days," about a Tokyo toilet cleaner, and Hirokazu Kore-eda, whose new film "Monster" is the first film he has shot in Japan since his Palme winner "Shoplifters." No director has ever taken the Palme three times, though Ken Loach could this year, if his new working-class drama "The Old Oak" proves as acclaimed as "The Wind That Shakes the Barley" and "I, Daniel Blake."
This year's Cannes has its fair share of long films -- "Occupied City," Steve McQueen's documentary about Nazi-occupied Amsterdam, runs four hours and six minutes -- but not every buzzy premiere will be feature-length. The fest will also premiere shorts directed by Pedro Almodóvar ("A Strange Way of Life") and the late Jean-Luc Godard ("Phony Wars"), while launching "The Idol," an already-controversial HBO series from the "Euphoria" mastermind Sam Levinson starring Abel "the Weeknd" Tesfaye.
And though the festival will offer G-rated pleasures in the form of Pixar's new film "Elemental," it wouldn't be Cannes without a few envelope-pushers. Keep an eye on Catherine Breillat, whose sexually explicit filmography ("Fat Girl," "Romance") gets a new entry with "Last Summer," about a lawyer who falls for her teenage stepson.
Then there's the film I'm most curious about: "The Zone of Interest," an Auschwitz-set drama from the director Jonathan Glazer. Rumor has it that Cannes passed on Glazer's audacious "Under the Skin" back in 2013 and was eager to make up for that mistake. Since Glazer's films ("Birth" and "Sexy Beast") are infrequent but stunning, a new project from the director is reason enough to say yes to Cannes -- and after that, there isn't really much to contemplate.

Full text: "Stranger Love," a singular and hypnotic work by Dylan Mattingly and Thomas Bartscherer, opens (and closes) on Saturday in Los Angeles.
Years ago, when the composer Dylan Mattingly was at work on a new project, he wrote to his collaborator, Thomas Bartscherer, telling him, "I often find that *really* long is better than just long."
Mattingly followed his own advice -- and then some. "Stranger Love," a singular, tender, euphoric, hypnotic opera that he and Bartscherer first envisioned 11 years ago, eventually grew to six hours, well past the point at which people start calling something impossible to produce.
"We went into it thinking it would never happen, because how could it?" Mattingly, 32, said in a recent interview.
Chunks of the piece have been performed in concert. But on Saturday -- for the first time, and for one performance only -- the whole thing will be staged at Walt Disney Concert Hall, the home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which has embraced "Stranger Love" as one of its trademark pie-in-the-sky presentations.
"Young, emerging artists who have big ideas deserve a place for that work to be seen," said Chad Smith, the Philharmonic's chief executive. "If the big institutions are not swinging for the rafters, why are we here?"
Directed by Lileana Blain-Cruz and played by Contemporaneous -- the ensemble Mattingly founded as an undergraduate at Bard College with David Bloom, who will conduct -- "Stranger Love" is not exactly Puccini, even if it does sketch a kind of love story. Largely abstract and intensely earnest, slowly telescoping into the cosmic sphere, it offers a heightened experience more than it does a concrete plot.
"The mood of the piece is something special," said the composer John Adams, long a friend and mentor to Mattingly. "I believe the length of it is part of its spiritual -- what can I say? -- its spiritual impetus."
"Stranger Love" recalls two other operas that sustain a time-suspending tone of meditative ecstasy for many hours, Philip Glass and Robert Wilson's "Einstein on the Beach" and Olivier Messiaen's "Saint François d'Assise." Its sensibility was shaped by a CD Mattingly grew up with that featured the Tahitian Choir: "this glorious, polyphonic, joyous sound," he said, "that's moving around itself and congealing and drifting apart." The early Minimalism of Glass is there, too, in the score's vast expanses of shifting harmonies and repeating rhythms.
Three pianos, each tuned slightly differently, give a woozy, honky-tonk feel to some of the music, and sometimes offer a clangorous evocation of gamelan, a tie to the open-eared, pan-Pacific California spirit of Harry Partch and Lou Harrison.
There's some of the lush overripeness of Messiaen's "Turangalîla-Symphonie" and the billowing fragrance of Debussy. And echoes of the stylized approach to character and the deceptively simple, sometimes almost childlike sound world of Meredith Monk's wordless opera "Atlas," which Mattingly said he listened to every night (literally) for a year before he began "Stranger Love."
His piece seems to float above the current-events themes of so much in new music. "It's not telling you who to vote for or where to stand on an issue," Bartscherer said, "but it's asking that you imagine a world that could be otherwise."
"I also think the dedication to joy is an interesting politics," Blain-Cruz said. "The dedication to fighting for the beauty in life, for people to see that and appreciate it. Like, don't kill our world; let's see it in its splendor and see that it's worth fighting for."
Bartscherer's spare text manages references to Anne Carson, Octavio Paz and Matthew Arnold, among others. A writer, translator and scholar, he was among Mattingly's first professors at Bard, and quickly became a fan of Contemporaneous after its founding in 2010. Leaving one of the group's concerts, Bartscherer had a vague idea for a piece of music theater: There would be two voices in love whose relationship develops, facing symbolic conflict from within and without, before resolving, all during a cycle of the four seasons.
He shared the notion with Mattingly, who had been composing since he was 6 but had been wanting to try writing vocal music. Passing material back and forth, they were soon off to the races; the two talk about "Stranger Love" almost as something that already existed complete, in some realm, needing to be discovered or channeled more than consciously created.
"It was there, somewhere," Bartscherer said. "And Dylan's antenna was hearing it somehow."
At a certain point, they abandoned trying to corral the project into a traditionally manageable length, embracing the kind of epic world-building that Mattingly loved in "The Lord of the Rings" and "Battlestar Galactica." On a 2014 visit to Point Reyes, on the California coast, Mattingly had a vision: The already sprawling score that he and Bartscherer had been working on was just Act I.
In this new conception, two more acts would follow, in which the voices would gradually drop out and the opera's scope would expand to encompass, first, human lovers beyond the initial pair, and then the expanding universe.
It took years to finish, even given Mattingly's single-minded focus. "Sometimes you have students, and you talk to them, and it takes two years to know that what you're talking about got into their daily life," said the composer David Lang, one of Mattingly's teachers during graduate school at Yale. "But he made music so fluidly, and in such a dedicated fashion, that everything we were talking about immediately came out in the work."
Mattingly and Bartscherer briefly thought about producing "Stranger Love" themselves, perhaps in an airplane hangar, but it was clear the cost would be prohibitive without an institutional partner. There were a lot of ignored emails from arts organizations; some who replied said that they couldn't say yes without seeing it first.
A concert performance of the nearly four-hour first act, presented by Beth Morrison and the Prototype festival in 2018, proved the material's viability -- to its creators, at least. But it was only when Adams encouraged Smith of the Los Angeles Philharmonic to take a look at the score, and Mattingly began to send along recorded clips, that "Stranger Love," long finished, was ex post facto commissioned by the Philharmonic for a staged production.
Blain-Cruz said that her staging aimed to be "both super simple and super grand," with projections (designed by Hannah Wasileski) that evoke the natural world and beyond. Chris Emile's choreography has been inspired by the cyclical movements of the planets and seasons.
"Chris as a choreographer is someone who's tapped into -- not lightly or glibly, but tapped into spirit," Blain-Cruz said. "All of his physical work, it reaches levels of possession in some ways. Dylan mentions gospel music and spiritual music, riling people up to make themselves open. And I think the choreography matches that."
Will "Stranger Love" have a life beyond Saturday? Mattingly has dreamed of doing it at the Park Avenue Armory in New York. But in the meantime, he and Bartscherer are already at work on another project. They claim that it will be shorter, but the title -- "History of Life" -- doesn't give the sense that their scope has gotten any less ambitious.
"I did voice my concern," Adams said, "that Dylan was creating a body of work that was always going to be a challenge to produce. And then I felt like a terrible old dad, like, 'Are you going to get a job?' He's willing to just live an extremely modest life, absolutely devoted to his art."

Pence Looks Toward '24 Run, Pitching Himself as a 'Classical' Conservative: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A pro-Pence super PAC is being formed, and so is a plan to barnstorm Iowa. "This campaign is going to reintroduce Mike Pence to the country as his own man," a G.O.P. operative said.
Former Vice President Mike Pence is expected to soon declare a long-shot campaign for the White House against the president under whom he served, pitching himself as a "classical conservative" who would return the Republican Party to its pre-Trump roots, according to people close to Mr. Pence.
Mr. Pence is working to carve out space in the Republican primary field by appealing to evangelicals, adopting a hard-line position in support of a federal abortion ban, promoting free trade and pushing back against Republican efforts to police big business on ideological grounds. He faces significant challenges, trails far behind in the polls and has made no effort to channel the populist energies overtaking the Republican Party.
In a sign his campaign will be announced in the coming weeks, a pro-Pence super PAC called Committed to America is being set up. A veteran Republican operative, Scott Reed, who ran Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign and was the longtime top political strategist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, will lead the group alongside Jeb Hensarling, a close friend of Mr. Pence's who served with him in Congress.
Mr. Pence finds himself in the highly unusual position of being a former vice president trying to squeeze back into the national conversation. The political profile he built under former President Donald J. Trump was more supplicant than standard-bearer, at least until the rupture in their relationship on Jan. 6, 2021. He would begin far behind Mr. Trump and Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida in early national and state polls of 2024 Republican primary voters.
The Pence candidacy will focus heavily on winning over evangelical voters, especially in Iowa, where the super PAC is already preparing to organize all 99 counties. Iowa's caucuses are the first contests for Republican presidential contenders early next year.
"Iowa feels more like Indiana than any other state in the union," Mr. Pence, a former governor of Indiana, said in a recent interview. "It just feels like home."
On a recent call with reporters, Mr. Reed, who will help lead the pro-Pence super PAC, described the Iowa caucuses as the "defining event" of Mr. Pence's candidacy and foreshadowed an old-fashioned blitz of retail politics. "We're going to organize Iowa, all 99 counties, like we're running him for county sheriff," he said.
If Mr. Trump represents the populist New Right, Mr. Pence is preparing to run for president in the mold of Ronald Reagan. His team's improbable bet is that a "Reagan coalition" -- composed of the Christian right, fiscal conservatives and national security hawks -- can be reassembled within a party transformed by Mr. Trump.
"We have to resist the siren song of populism unmoored to conservative principles," Mr. Pence said in the interview.
In a Tuesday night speech in New Hampshire focused on economics, Mr. Pence is expected to call for "free trade with free nations," according to a person familiar with the draft.
He is casting himself as a "Reagan conservative" and staking out sharply different positions from Mr. Trump and Mr. DeSantis on the most important policy questions framing the Republican 2024 race. Still, running against Mr. Trump so directly will force Mr. Pence to confront the contradictions inherent in having served as the president's yes-man for four years through the turmoil of the Trump administration.
"This campaign is going to reintroduce Mike Pence to the country as his own man," Mr. Reed said. "People know Mike Pence. They just don't know him well."
It remains to be seen how frequently Mr. Pence will discuss the moment that has defined him for the last two years: his rejection on Jan. 6 of Mr. Trump's pressure campaign to get him to exceed his constitutional authority while President Biden's Electoral College victory was certified.
That issue is not a winning one with the base of the Republican Party. But Mr. Pence's team believes there are enough Republicans who might be won over by Mr. Pence describing the moment as adhering to constitutional principles.
Mr. Pence stands almost alone among the prospective Republican field in advocating views that were once standard issue for his party.
Case in point: Mr. Pence says Social Security and Medicare must be trimmed back as part of any serious plan to deal with the national debt. Before Mr. Trump entered national politics in 2015, cutting entitlement programs was Republican orthodoxy. But Mr. Trump changed that. The former president has promised in his third campaign not to cut either program and he has attacked Mr. DeSantis on the issue, claiming the governor would cut those programs.
"It is fairly remarkable that Joe Biden and Donald Trump have the same position on fiscal solvency: The position of never going to touch Social Security and Medicare," Mr. Pence said.
Mr. Pence said he would "explain to people" how the "debt crisis" would affect their children and grandchildren. He says his plan to cut benefits won't apply to Social Security and Medicare payments for people in retirement today or who will retire in the next 25 years. But he will pitch ideas to cut spending for people under 40.
Mr. Pence is also drawing a stark contrast on foreign policy. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. DeSantis have questioned whether the United States should be supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion. Mr. Pence sees the battle as a modern version of the Cold War.
"There's a bit of a movement afoot in the Republican Party that would abandon our commitment to being the leader of the free world and that questions why we're providing military support in Ukraine," Mr. Pence said.
Unlike almost every major Republican running for president, Mr. Pence still defends former President George W. Bush's decisions to invade Afghanistan and Iraq, though he acknowledged in the interview that the "weapons of mass destruction" intelligence that Mr. Bush used to justify the Iraqi invasion was wrong.
"In the aftermath of September 11th, the president articulated a doctrine that I wholly supported," Mr. Pence said, "which was that it's harder for your enemies to project force if they're running backward."
Mr. Pence is also resisting the anti-corporate furies that are dominating Republican politics today, arguing limited government means not intervening in the private sector. He was one of the first major Republicans to criticize Mr. DeSantis for his fight against Disney.
In the view of New Right politicians such as Mr. DeSantis, limited-government conservatives are naïve to the fact that liberals have overtaken major American institutions -- academia, Fortune 500 companies, the news media -- and conservatives need to use governmental power to fight back.
Mr. Pence will run as a staunch social conservative, drawing a contrast with Mr. Trump on abortion policy. In his town hall with CNN last week, Mr. Trump repeatedly refused to say he would support a federal ban on abortion. He has said the issue should be left to the states.
Mr. Pence unapologetically endorses a national ban on abortion.
"For the former president and others who aspire to the highest office in the land to relegate that issue to states-only I think is wrong," Mr. Pence said. His senior adviser, Marc Short, said Mr. Pence regarded a 15-week national ban as a "minimal threshold" and would support federal efforts to "protect life beginning at conception."
There is little chance Mr. Pence will receive many endorsements from members of Congress. His team insists that Mr. Pence does not need elected officials to vouch for his credentials. Yet, it's also unclear how many Republican donors will back his bid. An early sign of interest came last week in Dallas when the billionaire Ross Perot Jr., a real estate developer and son of the former presidential candidate, hosted a lunch for Mr. Pence with other major donors, according to two people with direct knowledge of the gathering.
Among the hires for the super PAC supporting Mr. Pence is Bobby Saparow, who led the ground game for Gov. Brian Kemp's successful re-election campaign in Georgia in 2022, one of the few brights spots for Republicans in the midterms. Mr. Saparow promised to "replicate" the effort with Mr. Pence.
For now, Mr. Pence is signaling he's willing to do without a staple of Republican presidential campaigns in the modern era: Mr. Trump's smash-mouth politics and constant warfare against the media.
"People want to see us get back to having a threshold of civility in the public debate," Mr. Pence said. "And when I say that, when I tell people that I think democracy depends on heavy doses of civility, I get a very visceral response from crowds."

Striking Writers Disrupt TV's Big Ad Event: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Dozens of protesters greeted marketers as they entered the first major event of the upfronts, an annual showcase for advertisers in which media companies stage lavish gatherings to promote their lineups.
As scores of marketers made their way to Radio City Music Hall on Monday morning for a major event hosted by NBCUniversal, they were greeted by dozens of striking writers marching near the entrances to the building.
"NBC, you're no good, pay your writers like you should!" they chanted.
As the writers' strike enters its third week, demonstrators have set their sights on disturbing the so-called upfront week, a decades-old tradition where media companies stage lavish events to promote their lineups in an attempt to woo advertisers.
"This is why 'Saturday Night Live' wasn't on, huh?" one marketer remarked to another outside Radio City.
Even before Monday, when the upfronts officially started, the striking writers had already successfully shaken up the event. Netflix, which introduced commercials last year, was poised to have its first-ever upfront on Wednesday at the storied Paris Theater. But as executives grew concerned about the demonstrations, the streaming company abruptly canceled the in-person event late last week, and elected to make it virtual instead.
Other major media companies -- including Fox, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery -- have decided to forge ahead. Still, media executives have been anxiously awaiting the fallout from the prospect of hundreds of writers assembling on picket lines.
Text messages flew back and forth all weekend: Would more companies cancel their in-person upfront presentations? Would the sight and sounds of marching writers be too much for some marketers to bear, leaving hundreds of empty seats at venues like the Javits Center and the Theater at Madison Square Garden? And how much would a chaotic scene affect their bottom lines?
Negotiations between the major Hollywood studios and the Writers Guild of America, the union that represents the writers, broke down on May 1, and 11,500 writers for television and film immediately went on strike. The writers contend that their wages have stagnated and working conditions have deteriorated in the streaming era.
But the writers are not just demonstrating outside the major studios. They have also managed to delay or shut down some productions where scripts are in the can and filming continues. They have gone far afield as well, setting up pickets outside productions in Maplewood, N.J., Chicago and Philadelphia. Ted Sarandos, the co-chief executive of Netflix, canceled an appearance at the PEN America Literary Gala because of the threat of demonstrators. And there are grave concerns in the theater world that the Tony Awards will be postponed if the writers proceed with a plan to picket the award show.
Even without the strike, the mood surrounding this year's upfronts was gloomy. Advertising dollars remain a vital source of revenue for media companies, and billions of dollars are usually traded in the weeks and months after the upfronts. But the advertising market has been weak because of the declining viewership on network and cable television combined with broader economic concerns. Marketers have already indicated they are not willing to spend as freely as they have in previous upfronts.
Arjan Dijk, the chief marketing officer of Booking.com, said that "it's looking like a buyers market this year." And Kelly Metz, the managing director of advanced TV at Omnicom Media Group, said ad buyers responded to how their "clients are feeling and doing and faring, and there are some significant economic headwinds."
NBCUniversal has gone through a particularly chaotic stretch in recent weeks. In late April, NBCUniversal's chief executive was dismissed for inappropriate conduct. And late last week, Linda Yaccarino, NBCUniversal's advertising chief and longtime upfront master of ceremonies, abruptly left the company to become the chief executive of Twitter.
Ms. Yaccarino had been in rehearsals for this year's upfront as late as Thursday until Elon Musk tweeted that he had hired a new chief executive for Twitter. NBCUniversal announced on Friday that she was leaving, effective immediately, sending the company scrambling to rework the event.
At the NBCUniversal upfront, the strike's effect was apparent from the get-go. The gatherings are usually star-studded events, but with many actors and celebrities refusing to cross picket lines, the company turned to its news division for help. The "Morning Joe" host Willie Geist made an introduction for a "Saturday Night Live" trailer. And Stephanie Ruhle of MSNBC previewed the company's upcoming lineup of dramas.
When a trailer came on featuring NBC legends like Amy Poehler and the "Law & Order" executive producer Dick Wolf, it began with a title card disclosing that the interviews were taped in April, before the writers' strike began.
Still, the company was able to book some big named guests. Reba McEntire, the country singer who will be a judge on "The Voice" next season, performed, as did Nick Jonas.
And even with significantly pared down presentations, fears that marketers would stay away were unfounded -- nearly every seat at Radio City Music Hall was occupied.

Once Soaring, Vice Media Now Faces Bankruptcy: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Vice, which had wooed media giants, has struggled to adjust to the punishing realities of digital publishing. A group of creditors could buy Vice for $ 225 million.
Vice Media filed for bankruptcy on Monday, punctuating a yearslong descent from a new-media darling to a cautionary tale of the problems facing the digital publishing industry.
The bankruptcy will not interrupt daily operations for Vice's businesses, which in addition to its flagship website include the ad agency Virtue, the Pulse Films division and Refinery29, a women-focused site acquired by Vice in 2019.
A group of Vice's lenders, including Fortress Investment Group and Soros Fund Management, is in the leading position to acquire the company out of bankruptcy. The group has submitted a bid of $ 225 million, which would be covered by its existing loans to the company. It would also take over "significant liabilities" from Vice after any deal closes.
A sale process follows next. The lenders have secured a $ 20 million loan to continue operating Vice and then, if a better bid does not emerge, the group that includes Fortress and Soros will acquire Vice.
Still, the dreams that Vice executives once had of a stock market debut or a sale at an eye-popping valuation have been wiped away. The company was considered to be worth $ 5.7 billion at one point.
Investments from media titans like Disney and shrewd financial investors like TPG, which spent hundreds of millions of dollars, will be rendered worthless by the bankruptcy, cementing Vice's status among the most notable bad bets in the media industry.
Like some of its peers in the digital-media industry, including BuzzFeed and Vox Media, Vice and its investors bet big on the rising power of social media networks like Facebook and Instagram, anticipating they would deliver a tide of young, upwardly mobile readers that advertisers craved.
Though readers came by the millions, new media companies had trouble wringing profits from them, and the bulk of digital ad dollars went to the major tech platforms. Last month, BuzzFeed shut down its namesake Pulitzer Prize-winning news division after going public at a small fraction of its earlier valuation, and Vox Media earlier this year raised money at roughly half its 2015 valuation.
"There are definitely commonalities in the hardships media organizations have been facing and Vice is no exception," said S. Mitra Kalita, the founder and publisher of Epicenter-NYC, a community journalism company based in Queens. "We now know that a brand tethered to social media for its growth and audience alone is not sustainable."
Bankruptcy records filed Monday show that Vice is made up of a web of companies associated with its various businesses, including Pulse Films and Carrot Creative, an ad agency. The filings say Vice has outstanding debt of $ 834 million, dwarfing the amount Vice was recently in talks to sell for.
They also show Vice owes some of its biggest business partners millions of dollars. The company said it owed Wipro, an information technology firm, nearly $ 10 million. Justin Stefano, one of the co-founders of Refinery29, is owed more than $ 500,000, according to the filings. And Davis Wright Tremaine, a law firm that has represented Vice, has a claim of more than $ 300,000.
The bankruptcy filing will give the company some relief from its onerous debt load as its lenders, including Fortress, seek to salvage their investments. Vice Media raised a $ 250 million loan from Fortress and Soros Fund Management in 2019 as it struggled to make a profit. It has been in default on that loan for months.
"It's the lender coming in and saying, 'I'm done funding the losses -- if I'm going to fund the losses, I'm going to take control of the company,"' said Eric Snyder, chairman of bankruptcy at the law firm Wilk Auslander. "It's not unusual for the lender to come in and tell the debtor, the borrower, 'You're putting this into bankruptcy, you're going to make a motion to sell, we're going to put in a first bid."'
Fortress sees a continuing role at Vice for Shane Smith, the brash co-founder who became synonymous with the company's gonzo journalism from exotic locales and oversaw a boundary-pushing culture that was rife with allegations of sexual harassment, according to a person familiar with the matter. Hozefa Lokhandwala and Bruce Dixon, co-chief executives at Vice, will also stay on.
According to the terms of Vice's bankruptcy loan, the company has 55 days to complete a sale. In documents filed with the bankruptcy court, Vice said that the timeline to sale, "while tight," is necessary "to best position the company to survive as a going concern."
In a statement, Mr. Dixon and Mr. Lokhandwala said that the bankruptcy sale would ultimately "strengthen the company."
"We look forward to completing the sale process in the next two to three months and charting a healthy and successful next chapter at Vice."
The bankruptcy is a moment of humility for Vice, which a decade ago appeared destined to sell for an eye-watering sum or make its debut on the public markets. In the 2010s, Vice raised piles of money from traditional media companies, which it had assailed for growing complacent. The company sold advertisers and investors on its ability to reach young millennials who were hungry for an alternative to its corporate rivals, delivering you-are-there dispatches from North Korea and Liberia without the decorum of the mainstream news media.
But the harsh realities of digital publishing caught up with Vice, and things went sideways. In 2017, the company raised $ 400 million from the private equity firm TPG in a deal code-named "Project Venus" that valued the company at $ 5.7 billion. But the cash infusion saddled Vice with financial obligations if it didn't hit aggressive profitability targets, and it eventually became an albatross for the company. Later that year, The New York Times and other outlets published investigations into allegations of sexual harassment at the company, kicking off a crisis at Vice that shook confidence in its management.
Mr. Smith replaced himself as chief executive of the company, appointing Nancy Dubuc -- a longtime TV executive at A&E who shepherded hits like "Duck Dynasty" -- to oversee the sprawling Brooklyn-based media empire. Investors hoped Ms. Dubuc would sell the company or take it public, and she made repeated attempts.
The latest took place this winter, a sales process that drew interest from several potential suitors. Antenna Group, a Greek media company that has done business with Vice before, expressed interest in acquiring it, but a deal never materialized. Ms. Dubuc left in February, with no buyer in sight and without achieving her long-stated goal of consistently turning a profit at Vice.
The situation got worse last month. The company laid off employees after Antenna stopped making payments to Vice for a production deal worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The cuts included employees at Vice World News, the company's global reporting initiative, after it became clear those efforts were no longer financially viable.
Alex Detrick, a spokesman for Antenna and the former chief communications officer for Vice under Mr. Smith, declined to comment.
Ms. Kalita of Epicenter-NYC, who also co-founded URL Media -- a network of media outlets owned by Black and brown people that share content and advertising -- said Vice's bankruptcy was a reminder to founders to develop many different kinds of businesses beyond just advertising.
"I think even those of us running profitable media start-ups now," Ms. Kalita said, "are thinking more carefully about growth and making sure we can continuously define our audience and the value we represent to them."

A Six-Hour Opera Goes On for One Euphoric Night Only

Years ago, when composer Dylan Mattingly was at work on a new project, he wrote to his collaborator, Thomas Bartscherer, telling him, “I often find that *really* long is better than just long.”
Mattingly followed his own advice — and then some. “Stranger Love,” a singular, tender, euphoric, hypnotic opera that he and Bartscherer first envisioned 11 years ago, eventually grew to six hours, well past the point at which people start calling something impossible to produce.
“We went into it thinking it would never happen, because how could it?” Mattingly, 32, said in a recent interview.
Chunks of the piece have been performed in concert. But on Saturday — for the first time, and for one performance only — the whole thing will be staged at Walt Disney Concert Hall, the home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which has embraced “Stranger Love” as one of its trademark pie-in-the-sky presentations.
“Young, emerging artists who have big ideas deserve a place for that work to be seen,” said Chad Smith, the Philharmonic’s CEO. “If the big institutions are not swinging for the rafters, why are we here?”
Directed by Lileana Blain-Cruz and played by Contemporaneous — the ensemble Mattingly founded as an undergraduate at Bard College with David Bloom, who will conduct — “Stranger Love” is not exactly Puccini, even if it does sketch a kind of love story. Largely abstract and intensely earnest, slowly telescoping into the cosmic sphere, it offers a heightened experience more than it does a concrete plot.
“The mood of the piece is something special,” said composer John Adams, long a friend and mentor to Mattingly. “I believe the length of it is part of its spiritual — what can I say? — its spiritual impetus.”
“Stranger Love” recalls two other operas that sustain a time-suspending tone of meditative ecstasy for many hours, Philip Glass and Robert Wilson’s “Einstein on the Beach” and Olivier Messiaen’s “Saint François d’Assise.” Its sensibility was shaped by a CD Mattingly grew up with that featured the Tahitian Choir: “this glorious, polyphonic, joyous sound,” he said, “that’s moving around itself and congealing and drifting apart.” The early minimalism of Glass is there, too, in the score’s vast expanses of shifting harmonies and repeating rhythms.
Three pianos, each tuned slightly differently, give a woozy, honky-tonk feel to some of the music, and sometimes offer a clangorous evocation of gamelan, a tie to the open-eared, pan-Pacific California spirit of Harry Partch and Lou Harrison.
There’s some of the lush overripeness of Messiaen’s “Turangalîla-Symphonie” and the billowing fragrance of Debussy. And echoes of the stylized approach to character and the deceptively simple, sometimes almost childlike sound world of Meredith Monk’s wordless opera “Atlas,” which Mattingly said he listened to every night (literally) for a year before he began “Stranger Love.”
His piece seems to float above the current-events themes of so much in new music. “It’s not telling you who to vote for or where to stand on an issue,” Bartscherer said, “but it’s asking that you imagine a world that could be otherwise.”
“I also think the dedication to joy is an interesting politics,” Blain-Cruz said. “The dedication to fighting for the beauty in life, for people to see that and appreciate it. Like, don’t kill our world; let’s see it in its splendor and see that it’s worth fighting for.”
Bartscherer’s spare text manages references to Anne Carson, Octavio Paz and Matthew Arnold, among others. A writer, translator and scholar, he was among Mattingly’s first professors at Bard, and quickly became a fan of Contemporaneous after its founding in 2010. Leaving one of the group’s concerts, Bartscherer had a vague idea for a piece of music theater: There would be two voices in love whose relationship develops, facing symbolic conflict from within and without, before resolving, all during a cycle of the four seasons.
He shared the notion with Mattingly, who had been composing since he was 6 but had been wanting to try writing vocal music. Passing material back and forth, they were soon off to the races; the two talk about “Stranger Love” almost as something that already existed complete, in some realm, needing to be discovered or channeled more than consciously created.
“It was there, somewhere,” Bartscherer said. “And Dylan’s antenna was hearing it somehow.”
At a certain point, they abandoned trying to corral the project into a traditionally manageable length, embracing the kind of epic world-building that Mattingly loved in “The Lord of the Rings” and “Battlestar Galactica.” On a 2014 visit to Point Reyes, on the California coast, Mattingly had a vision: The sprawling score that he and Bartscherer had been working on was just Act I.
In this new conception, two more acts would follow, in which the voices would gradually drop out and the opera’s scope would expand to encompass, first, human lovers beyond the initial pair, and then the expanding universe.
It took years to finish, even given Mattingly’s single-minded focus. “Sometimes you have students, and you talk to them, and it takes two years to know that what you’re talking about got into their daily life,” said composer David Lang, one of Mattingly’s teachers during graduate school at Yale. “But he made music so fluidly, and in such a dedicated fashion, that everything we were talking about immediately came out in the work.”
Mattingly and Bartscherer briefly thought about producing “Stranger Love” themselves, perhaps in an airplane hangar, but it was clear the cost would be prohibitive without an institutional partner. There were a lot of ignored emails from arts organizations; some who replied said that they couldn’t say yes without seeing it first.
A concert performance of the nearly four-hour first act, presented by Beth Morrison and the Prototype festival in 2018, proved the material’s viability — to its creators, at least. But it was only when Adams encouraged Smith of the Los Angeles Philharmonic to take a look at the score, and Mattingly began to send along recorded clips, that “Stranger Love,” long finished, was ex post facto commissioned by the Philharmonic for a staged production.
Blain-Cruz said that her staging aimed to be “both super simple and super grand,” with projections (designed by Hannah Wasileski) that evoke the natural world and beyond. Chris Emile’s choreography has been inspired by the cyclical movements of the planets and seasons.
“Chris as a choreographer is someone who’s tapped into — not lightly or glibly, but tapped into spirit,” Blain-Cruz said. “All of his physical work, it reaches levels of possession in some ways. Dylan mentions gospel music and spiritual music, riling people up to make themselves open. And I think the choreography matches that.”
Will “Stranger Love” have a life beyond Saturday? Mattingly has dreamed of doing it at the Park Avenue Armory in New York. But in the meantime, he and Bartscherer are at work on another project. They claim that it will be shorter, but the title — “History of Life” — doesn’t give the sense that their scope has gotten any less ambitious.
“I did voice my concern,” Adams said, “that Dylan was creating a body of work that was always going to be a challenge to produce. And then I felt like a terrible old dad, like, ‘Are you going to get a job?’ He’s willing to just live an extremely modest life, absolutely devoted to his art.”

It's Been a Tumultuous Week. What Does It Tell Us About 2024?: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The presidential race has started to crystallize, with flawed standard-bearers, worried political parties and voters unhappy with their choices.
Eighteen months is an eternity in politics.
But rapid-fire and high-profile events over the past week have set the tone and clarified the stakes of a still nascent presidential race featuring an incumbent president and a Republican front-runner whom many Americans, according to polling, do not want as their choices -- but may feel resigned to accept.
The week began with a surprising poll -- probably an outlier -- that showed President Biden losing to both former President Donald J. Trump and his closest presumptive primary competitor, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida.
Then in quick succession came a jury's verdict holding Mr. Trump liable for sexual abuse, a raucous New Hampshire town hall that brought the former president's falsehoods and bluster back into the spotlight, the lifting of pandemic-era controls at the U.S.-Mexico border, and a raft of endorsements for Mr. DeSantis -- and an unscheduled visit to show up Mr. Trump -- in Iowa that showed many Republican leaders are open to a Trump alternative.
All of that left leaders, strategists and voters in both parties exceptionally anxious.
"We're in the midst of a primary that has yet to even really form, and meanwhile the opportunity to pound Biden into dirt with his incompetence is slipping," said Dave Carney, a longtime Republican consultant in New Hampshire, where the first Republican primary votes will be cast in February. "It's scattershot right now."
Democrats, who would be expected to rally around their standard-bearer, have spent the week expressing a divide on border security and questioning the president on key policy issues.
Strategists have begged Democratic voters to get over their discontent and accept the president as the best they're going to get.
"Live in the real world," Stuart Stevens, the longtime Republican political consultant who bolted from the party as Mr. Trump rose to power, exhorted after the New Hampshire town hall. "If you saw Donald Trump tonight and aren't supporting Biden, you are helping elect Trump. It's not complicated."
Representative Ro Khanna of California, a liberal Democrat often willing to say openly what other rank-and-file Democrats won't, laid out a vision for economic renewal in a Friday speech in New Hampshire that contrasted the president's more modest ambitions with his failure to secure the allegiance of white working-class voters whom Mr. Biden has said he is uniquely qualified to win back.
"People are so desperate for some healing, for leadership that can unify," Mr. Khanna told Democrats at a dinner in Nashua. "We do not need to compromise who we are to find common cause."
In an interview on Saturday, he said it was not meant to be a criticism. But it was "an appeal for a bolder platform that captures the imagination of working-class Americans and inspires them."
There's no question that political predictions this far from an election are unreliable. Mr. DeSantis has yet to declare his candidacy for the White House, though he and Mr. Trump have been circling each other and competing in a shadow contest in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first contests for the Republican presidential nomination. Even Iowa voters tend not to tune in to the race until later in the year, noted David Kochel, a longtime Iowa Republican consultant.
Still, the question of the moment remains: Where are we?
Simon Rosenberg, who correctly predicted that a surge of Democratic activism would blunt the promised "red wave" of the 2022 midterms, said the "fear of MAGA" that powered Democratic victories in 2018, 2020 and 2022 had not diminished ahead of 2024. If anything, abortion bans rolling from state to state across the country, a disheartening surge in mass shootings and a Republican assault on educational freedom will only sharpen those fears, he said.
Mr. Trump's performance at a CNN town hall on Wednesday evening -- in which the former president repeatedly lied about the 2020 election; mocked E. Jean Carroll, whose accusations of sexual abuse and defamation ended in a $ 5 million judgment against him; and promised a return to some of his least popular policies -- only reiterated why Democrats, independents and disaffected Republicans have turned away from the G.O.P. in the key states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
The Biden re-election campaign, now in full gear after his formal announcement last month, was making the case to reporters after the town hall, pointing to Mr. Trump's pride in the overturning of Roe v. Wade; his dismissive take on the economic catastrophe that could ensue if the federal government defaults on its outstanding debt; his referring to Jan. 6, 2021, as "a beautiful day"; and his refusal to commit to accepting the 2024 election results.
One Biden campaign adviser suggested that Mr. Trump had supplied a trove of material for attack ads. The campaign began posting videos almost immediately. Mr. DeSantis's super PAC, Never Back Down, called the 70-minute performance "over an hour of nonsense."
The crucial question for both parties in 2024 is how to retain the voters they have and regain those they have lost.
"It's hard to understand how someone could vote for Joe Biden in 2020 and Trump in 2024, given that Trump is just going to get more Trumpy," Mr. Rosenberg said, adding, "I'd still much rather be us than them."
Mr. Rosenberg's assessment may be why 37 Republican officials in Iowa, including the State Senate president, Amy Sinclair, and the House majority leader, Matt Windschitl, endorsed Mr. DeSantis last week, as did the New Hampshire House majority leader, Jason Osborne.
Republican consultants in both states said Mr. Trump's universal name recognition and political persona might give him the highest floor for Republican support, but the same factors lower the ceiling of that support, giving Mr. DeSantis and other challengers a real chance to take him down, if they are willing to take it.
The Trump campaign seemed aware of that dynamic last week as it attacked would-be rivals, not only those clearly preparing to enter the race but also some far from it. On Saturday, Mr. Trump laid into Georgia's Republican governor, Brian Kemp, for being disloyal, just days after an article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution suggested the governor was keeping his options open.
Mr. DeSantis has had his own stumbles out of the gate. His war with Disney has provided fodder for rivals who have questioned a Republican's intrusion into the free market. His signing of a six-week abortion ban and his state's aggressive censorship of school textbooks have raised questions among would-be Republican donors and swing voters alike. But the Florida governor also has plenty of time to make his case.
"There's a lot of game left to play, and I don't see anything gelling yet," Mr. Kochel said. "There's still a lot of room for candidates not named Trump."
What Republicans seem most amazed by is the docility of Democrats in the face of Mr. Biden's obvious weaknesses. Age and infirmity are real issues, not Republican talking points, consultants say.
A Washington Post-ABC News poll published on Monday showed Mr. Biden losing head-to-head races against Mr. Trump and Mr. DeSantis by between five and six percentage points. Democratic pollsters have dismissed those results, pointing to anomalies like the poll's showing Mr. Trump winning young voters outright while dramatically closing the gap with Mr. Biden for Black and Hispanic votes.
Even so, there was much in the poll to undermine Mr. Biden's claim that he, more than any other Democrat, can vanquish a Republican comeback just as he defeated Mr. Trump in 2020.
Republicans say that's just not possible.
Mr. Carney said the dynamic would get worse, not better, as the 2024 campaign took shape. Chaotic scenes from the southwestern border in the coming weeks will inflame Republican voters' fears of an "invasion" of illegal immigrants; the Republican National Committee on Friday held the president responsible for 1.4 million "gotaway" migrants that it said had crossed the border and disappeared into the interior since he took office.
More important, the situation at the border could crystallize a sense among swing voters that Mr. Biden is simply not in control. With erstwhile allies like New York's mayor, Eric Adams, and Chicago's outgoing mayor, Lori Lightfoot, pleading for assistance with a flood of migrants, that conclusion will not be contained to Republican voters.
The brewing showdown over how to raise the federal government's borrowing limit threatens to provoke a catastrophic financial crisis as soon as next month. And while voters might blame Republicans in Congress at first, economic turmoil eventually ends up in the president's lap.
Perhaps Mr. Biden's voters will not defect back to Mr. Trump, Republicans agree, but they could simply stay home on Election Day.
"Democrats keep saying, 'Oh, Trump's so bad it doesn't matter,"' Mr. Kochel said. "I don't know. I think it matters."

Why Ron DeSantis Is Limping to the Starting Line

In November, Rep. Byron Donalds scored a coveted speaking slot: introducing Gov. Ron DeSantis after a landslide reelection turned the swing state of Florida deep red. Standing onstage at a victory party for DeSantis in Tampa, Donalds praised him as “America’s governor.”
By April, Donalds was seated at a table next to another Florida Republican: Donald Trump. He was at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s private club, for a multicourse dinner with nine other House Republicans from Florida who had spurned their home-state governor to endorse the former president’s 2024 run. Red “Make America Great Again” hats decorated their place settings.
In six short months from November to May, DeSantis’ 2024 run has faltered before it has even begun.
Allies have abandoned him. Tales of his icy interpersonal touch have spread. Donors have groused. And a legislative session in Tallahassee designed to burnish his conservative credentials has instead coincided with a drop in the polls.
His decision not to begin any formal campaign until after the Florida legislative session — allowing him to cast himself as a conservative fighter who not only won but actually delivered results — instead opened a window of opportunity for Trump. The former president filled the void with personal attacks and a heavy rotation of negative advertising from his super political action committee. Combined with DeSantis’ cocooning himself in the right-wing media and the Trump team’s success in outflanking him on several fronts, the governor has lost control of his own national narrative.
Now, as DeSantis’ Tallahassee-based operation pivots to formally entering the race in the coming weeks, DeSantis and his allies are retooling for a more aggressive new phase. His staunchest supporters privately acknowledge that DeSantis needs to recalibrate a political outreach and media strategy that has allowed Trump to define the race.
Changes are afoot. DeSantis is building a strong Iowa operation. He has been calling influential Republicans in Iowa and is rolling out a large slate of state legislator endorsements before a weekend trip there.
“He definitely indicated that if he gets in, he will work exceptionally hard — nothing will be below him,” said Bob Vander Plaats, an influential Iowa evangelical leader whom DeSantis hosted recently for a meal at the governor’s mansion. “I think he understands — I emphasized that Iowa’s a retail politics state. You need to shake people’s hands, look them in the eye.”
Still, his central electability pitch — MAGA without the mess — has been badly bruised.
A book tour that was supposed to have introduced him nationally was marked by missteps that deepened concerns about his readiness for the biggest stage. He took positions on two pressing domestic and international issues — abortion and the war in Ukraine — that generated second-guessing and backlash among some allies and would-be benefactors. And the moves he has made to appeal to the hard right — escalating his feud with Disney, signing a strict six-week abortion ban — have unnerved donors who are worried about the general election.
“I was in the DeSantis camp,” said Andrew Sabin, a metals magnate who gave the Florida governor $50,000 last year. “But he started opening his mouth, and a lot of big donors said his views aren’t tolerable.” He specifically cited abortion and Ukraine.
Three billionaires who are major GOP donors — Steve Wynn, Ike Perlmutter and Thomas Peterffy, a past DeSantis patron who has publicly soured on him — dined recently with Vivek Ramaswamy, a 37-year-old long-shot Republican.
The early months of 2023 have exposed a central challenge for DeSantis. He needs to stitch together an unwieldy ideological coalition bridging both anti-Trump Republicans and Trump supporters who are nonetheless considering turning the page on the past president. Hitting and hugging Trump at the same time has bedeviled rivals since Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, tried to do so in 2016, and Cruz veterans fill key roles in DeSantis’ campaign and his super PAC.
Allies of both leading Republicans caution that it’s still early.
DeSantis has more than $100 million stored across various pro-DeSantis accounts. He is building goodwill with state party leaders by headlining fundraisers. He remains, in public polls, the most serious rival to Trump. And a supportive super PAC called Never Back Down is staffing up across more than a dozen states, has already spent more than $10 million on television ads and has peppered early states with direct mail.
DeSantis supporters point to polls showing that the governor remains well-liked by Republicans.
“The hits aren’t working,” said Kristin Davison, chief operating officer of Never Back Down. “His favorability has not changed.”
The DeSantis team declined to provide any comment for this story.
Six months ago, as Republicans were blaming Trump for the party’s 2022 midterm underperformance, a high-flying DeSantis made the traditional political decision that he would govern first in early 2023 and campaign second. The rush of conservative priorities that DeSantis has turned into law in Florida — on guns, immigration, abortion, school vouchers, opposing China — is expected to form the backbone of his campaign.
“Now, the governor can create momentum by spending time publicly touting his endless accomplishments, calling supporters and engaging more publicly to push back on the false narratives his potential competitors are spewing,” said Nick Iarossi, a lobbyist in Florida and a longtime DeSantis supporter.
A turning point this year for Trump was his Manhattan indictment, which DeSantis waffled on responding to as the GOP base rallied to Trump’s defense.
Yet Trump’s compounding legal woes and potential future indictments could eventually have the opposite effect — exhausting voters, which is DeSantis’ hope. A jury found Trump liable this past week for sexual abuse and defamation. “When you get all these lawsuits coming at you,” DeSantis told one associate recently, “it’s just distracting.”
‘So God Made a Fighter’
The DeSantis team seemed to buy its own hype.
Days before the midterms, the DeSantis campaign released a video that cast his rise as ordained from on high. “On the eighth day, God looked down on his planned paradise and said, ‘I need a protector,’” a narrator booms as DeSantis appears on-screen. “So God made a fighter.”
For years, the self-confident DeSantis has relied on his own instincts and the counsel of his wife, Casey DeSantis, who posted the video, to set his political course, according to past aides and current associates. DeSantis has been written off before — in his first primary for governor; in his first congressional primary — so both he and his wife have gotten used to tuning out critics.
Today, allies say there are few people around who are willing to tell DeSantis he’s wrong, even in private.
In late 2022, the thinking was that a decision on 2024 could wait, and Trump’s midterm hangover would linger. DeSantis published a book — “I was, you know, kind of a hot commodity,” he said of writing it — that became a bestseller. And DeSantis was on the offensive, tweaking Trump with a February donor retreat held only miles from Mar-a-Lago that drew Trump contributors.
But it has been Trump who has consistently one-upped DeSantis, flying into East Palestine, Ohio, after the rail disaster there, appearing with a larger crowd in the same Iowa city days after DeSantis and swiping Florida congressional endorsements while DeSantis traveled to Washington.
One Trump endorser, Rep. Lance Gooden of Texas, backed the former president only hours after attending a private group meeting with DeSantis. In an interview, Gooden likened DeSantis’ decision to delay entry until after a legislative session to the example of a past Texas governor, Rick Perry, who did the same a decade ago — and quickly flamed out of the 2012 contest.
“He’s relied, much like Rick Perry did, on local political experts in his home state that just don’t know the presidential landscape,” Gooden said.
‘I’ve Said Enough’
Trump has insinuated, without providing evidence, that DeSantis had inappropriate relationships with high school girls during a stint as a teacher in the early 2000s and that DeSantis might be gay.
His team has portrayed DeSantis as socially inept, and a pro-Trump super PAC distributed a video — dubbed “Pudding Fingers” — playing off news articles about DeSantis’ uncouth eating habits.
People close to Trump have been blunt in private discussions that the hits so far are just the start: If DeSantis ever appears poised to capture the nomination, the former president will do everything he can to tear him apart.
Beginning with his response to the coronavirus outbreak, DeSantis’ national rise has been uniquely powered by his ability to make the right enemies: in academia, in the news media, among liberal activists and at the White House. But Trump’s broadsides and some of his own actions have put DeSantis crosswise with the right for the first time. It has been a disorienting experience for the DeSantis operation, according to allies.
For the past three years, DeSantis has had the luxury of completely shutting out what he pejoratively brands the “national regime media” or “the corporate media” — although Rupert Murdoch’s Fox Corp. does not, in his view, count as corporate media.
This strategy served DeSantis well in Florida. But avoiding sit-down interviews with skeptical journalists has left him out of practice as he prepares for the most intense scrutiny of his career.
“The Murdochs encapsulated him in a bubble and force-fed him to a conservative audience,” said Steve Bannon, a former strategist for Trump. “He hasn’t been scuffed up. He hasn’t had these questions put in his grill.”
Even in friendly settings, DeSantis has stumbled. In a February interview with The Times of London, a Murdoch property, DeSantis cut off questions after the reporter pushed him on how he thought President Joe Biden should handle Ukraine differently.
Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson was so irked by DeSantis’ evasion that he sent a detailed questionnaire to potential Republican presidential candidates to force them to state their positions on the war, according to two people familiar with his decision.
In a written response, DeSantis characterized Russia’s invasion as a “territorial dispute.” Republican hawks and some of DeSantis’ top donors were troubled. In public, the governor soon cleaned up his statement to say Russia had not had “a right” to invade. In private, DeSantis tried to calm supporters by noting that his statement had not taken a position against aid to Ukraine.
While DeSantis has stuck to his preferred way of doing things, Trump has given seats on his plane to reporters from outlets that have published harsh stories about him. And despite having spent years calling CNN “fake news,” Trump recently attended a CNN town hall.
DeSantis allies said the governor would begrudgingly bring in some of the “national regime media.” Some early proof: The governor’s tight-lipped team invited a Politico columnist to Tallahassee and supplied rare on-the-record access.
‘I Was a Bit Insulted’
Not long after DeSantis had won in a landslide last fall, incoming freshman Rep. Cory Mills, R-Fla., called the governor’s team to try to thank him for his support. Mills had campaigned on the eve of the election with Casey DeSantis and had appeared with the governor, too. “I called to show my appreciation and never even got a call back,” Mills said in an interview. “To be honest with you, I was a bit insulted by it.”
The lack of relationships on Capitol Hill became a public headache in April when Trump rolled out what eventually became 10 Florida House Republican endorsements during DeSantis’ trip to Washington.
Donors who contributed to DeSantis’ previous campaigns tell stories of meetings in which the candidate looked as if he would rather be anywhere else. He fiddled with his phone, showed no interest in his hosts and escaped as quickly as possible. But people who have recently met with DeSantis say he has been far more engaged. At recent Wisconsin and New Hampshire events, the governor worked the room as he had rarely done before.
The governor and his team have had internal conversations acknowledging the need for him to engage in the basics of political courtship: small talk, handshaking, eye contact.
For his part, Trump recently relished hosting the Florida House Republicans who had endorsed him.
On one side of him was Mills. On the other was Donalds, who had introduced DeSantis on election night and who had been in DeSantis’ orbit since helping with debate prep during DeSantis’ 2018 run for governor.
Donalds declined an interview. But footage of those private debate-prep sessions, first reported by ABC News, shows DeSantis trying to formulate an answer to a question that will define his imminent 2024 run: how to disagree with Trump without appearing disagreeable to Trump supporters.
“I have to frame it in a way,” DeSantis said then, “that’s not going to piss off all his voters.”

Full text: What's Up? (May 7-13)
CNN's Trumpcast
Until last week, former President Donald J. Trump had not appeared on CNN since 2016. But at a town hall hosted by the network on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump, the Republican front-runner in the 2024 presidential campaign, resumed the lies and name-calling that marked his presidency. Answering questions from the anchor Kaitlan Collins, he repeated misinformation about the 2020 election, called the writer E. Jean Carroll, who won a suit accusing him of sexual abuse and defamation, a "wack job" and derided Ms. Collins as a "nasty person." When Ms. Collins tried to correct Mr. Trump's lies, he often talked over her. The largely sympathetic audience cheered him on throughout the evening. Critics of CNN's forum said it was reckless to give Mr. Trump such a large platform for his message, especially because it proved difficult to fact check his statements in real time. The chairman of CNN, Chris Licht, defended the broadcast on Thursday, saying it underscored that covering Mr. Trump would "continue to be messy and tricky."
Inflation Is Slowing
A closely watched report on Wednesday showed that inflation in the United States had reached a noteworthy milestone: April was the 10th straight month that the pace of price increases slowed. The Consumer Price Index climbed 4.9 percent from a year earlier, surpassing analysts' expectations -- in a good way. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had forecast a 5 percent climb. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and fuel costs, also fell slightly. The report comes on the heels of the Federal Reserve's 10th consecutive increase to its benchmark rate. The latest inflation data, along with other signs of a slowdown in the economy, could make the May increase the last one for now.
Elon Musk's Announcement
Elon Musk long ago asked users on Twitter if he should step down as chief executive of the platform. "I will abide by the results of this poll," he said. The results came in: Almost 58 percent of the 17.5 million people who voted agreed that Mr. Musk should leave his post. But it was still somewhat surprising when Mr. Musk announced on Friday that he had chosen his replacement: He said his successor would be Linda Yaccarino, the chair of global advertising and partnerships at NBCUniversal. Mr. Musk said Ms. Yaccarino, who recently interviewed him onstage at an advertising event in Miami, would focus on business operations while he would continue to work on product design and technology.
What's Next? (May 14-20)
Senate Hearings on the Banking Crisis
Two groups that have sought to blame each other for the recent bank failures will appear at a pair of Senate hearings this week -- the heads of those banks and the federal regulators who oversee them. On Tuesday, Greg Becker, the former chief executive of Silicon Valley Bank, who stepped down from his post after the bank's collapse in March, will testify before the Senate Banking Committee. Two former top executives from Signature Bank, which failed two days later, will also testify. They are expected to meet a harsh reception from lawmakers. In a letter summoning Mr. Becker to appear, the chairman of the committee wrote, "You must answer for the bank's downfall." Regulators can expect a grilling, too, at a separate hearing on Thursday. When regulators appeared before the committee last month, members of Congress on both sides of the aisle faulted shortcomings in oversight for the banking crisis. Regulators also pointed the finger at the banks' mismanagement.
More Turmoil at Fox
Dominion Voting Systems' defamation suit against Fox News, which was settled for $ 787.5 million in April, may have been only the opening salvo in a long fight to hold the network accountable for airing misinformation about the 2020 presidential election. Last week, Nina Jankowicz, a prominent specialist in Russian disinformation and online harassment, filed a new defamation suit accusing Fox of spreading lies about her that led to serious threats to her safety and harm to her career. That's not Fox's only legal trouble. It still faces a defamation suit from another election technology company, Smartmatic, which is seeking $ 2.7 billion in damages. Meanwhile, Tucker Carlson, the network's star host who was recently ousted and is still under contract, has said he is starting his own show on Twitter, a sign that negotiations to reach an amicable separation with the network have broken down.
Report Cards for Big Box Stores
Walmart and Target, two of the country's largest retailers, will release their quarterly earnings reports this week, providing a glimpse at how inflation -- which is falling but persistent -- is affecting consumers. For the three months that ended in January, Walmart reported that its revenue was 7.3 percent higher than a year earlier and said December was its best month for sales at its U.S. stores in its history. But the company warned of dimmer prospects for the rest of the fiscal year, suggesting that consumers' ability to absorb higher prices could be approaching its limit. Other retailers struck similar downbeat notes, suggesting that they expected conditions to worsen in the coming months.
What Else?
Goldman Sachs said on Monday that it would pay $ 215 million to settle a gender bias suit accusing the bank of hindering women's career advancement and paying them less than their male colleagues. Disney, in its quarterly earnings report last week, said that it had narrowed its streaming losses but that revenue from its old-line TV channels had fallen sharply. And Peloton said it was recalling more than two million exercise bikes because of reports of a faulty part.

DeSantis, Bruised by Missteps, Is Limping to the Starting Line: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In November, Representative Byron Donalds scored a coveted speaking slot: introducing Gov. Ron DeSantis after a landslide re-election turned the swing state of Florida deep red. Standing onstage at a victory party for Mr. DeSantis in Tampa, Mr. Donalds praised him as "America's governor."
By April, Mr. Donalds was seated at a table next to another Florida Republican: Donald J. Trump. He was at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's private club, for a multicourse dinner with nine other House Republicans from Florida who had spurned their home-state governor to endorse the former president's 2024 run. Red "Make America Great Again" hats decorated their place settings.
In six short months from November to May, Mr. DeSantis's 2024 run has faltered before it has even begun.
Allies have abandoned him. Tales of his icy interpersonal touch have spread. Donors have groused. And a legislative session in Tallahassee designed to burnish his conservative credentials has instead coincided with a drop in the polls.
His decision not to begin any formal campaign until after the Florida legislative session -- allowing him to cast himself as a conservative fighter who not only won but actually delivered results -- instead opened a window of opportunity for Mr. Trump. The former president filled the void with personal attacks and a heavy rotation of negative advertising from his super PAC. Combined with Mr. DeSantis's cocooning himself in the right-wing media and the Trump team's success in outflanking him on several fronts, the governor has lost control of his own national narrative.
Now, as Mr. DeSantis's Tallahassee-based operation pivots to formally entering the race in the coming weeks, Mr. DeSantis and his allies are retooling for a more aggressive new phase. His staunchest supporters privately acknowledge that Mr. DeSantis needs to recalibrate a political outreach and media strategy that has allowed Mr. Trump to define the race.
Changes are afoot. Mr. DeSantis is building a strong Iowa operation. He has been calling influential Republicans in Iowa and is rolling out a large slate of state legislator endorsements before a weekend trip there.
"He definitely indicated that if he gets in, he will work exceptionally hard -- nothing will be below him," said Bob Vander Plaats, an influential Iowa evangelical leader whom Mr. DeSantis hosted recently for a meal at the governor's mansion. "I think he understands -- I emphasized that Iowa's a retail politics state. You need to shake people's hands, look them in the eye."
Still, his central electability pitch -- MAGA without the mess -- has been badly bruised.
A book tour that was supposed to have introduced him nationally was marked by missteps that deepened concerns about his readiness for the biggest stage. He took positions on two pressing domestic and international issues -- abortion and the war in Ukraine -- that generated second-guessing and backlash among some allies and would-be benefactors. And the moves he has made to appeal to the hard right -- escalating his feud with Disney, signing a strict six-week abortion ban -- have unnerved donors who are worried about the general election.
"I was in the DeSantis camp," said Andrew Sabin, a metals magnate who gave the Florida governor $ 50,000 last year. "But he started opening his mouth, and a lot of big donors said his views aren't tolerable." He specifically cited abortion and Ukraine.
Three billionaires who are major G.O.P. donors -- Steve Wynn, Ike Perlmutter and Thomas Peterffy, a past DeSantis patron who has publicly soured on him -- dined recently with Vivek Ramaswamy, the 37-year-old long-shot Republican.
The early months of 2023 have exposed a central challenge for Mr. DeSantis. He needs to stitch together an unwieldy ideological coalition bridging both anti-Trump Republicans and Trump supporters who are nonetheless considering turning the page on the past president. Hitting and hugging Mr. Trump at the same time has bedeviled rivals since Senator Ted Cruz tried to do so in 2016, and Cruz veterans fill key roles in Mr. DeSantis's campaign and his super PAC.
Allies of both leading Republicans caution that it's still early.
Mr. DeSantis has more than $ 100 million stored across various pro-DeSantis accounts. He is building good will with state party leaders by headlining fund-raisers. He remains, in public polls, the most serious rival to Mr. Trump. And a supportive super PAC called Never Back Down is staffing up across more than a dozen states, has already spent more than $ 10 million on television ads and has peppered early states with direct mail.
DeSantis supporters point to polls showing that the governor remains well-liked by Republicans.
"The hits aren't working," said Kristin Davison, chief operating officer of Never Back Down. "His favorability has not changed."
The DeSantis team declined to provide any comment for this story.
Six months ago, as Republicans were blaming Mr. Trump for the party's 2022 midterm underperformance, a high-flying Mr. DeSantis made the traditional political decision that he would govern first in early 2023 and campaign second. The rush of conservative priorities that Mr. DeSantis has turned into law in Florida -- on guns, immigration, abortion, school vouchers, opposing China -- is expected to form the backbone of his campaign.
"Now, the governor can create momentum by spending time publicly touting his endless accomplishments, calling supporters and engaging more publicly to push back on the false narratives his potential competitors are spewing," said Nick Iarossi, a lobbyist in Florida and a longtime DeSantis supporter.
A turning point this year for Mr. Trump was his Manhattan indictment, which Mr. DeSantis waffled on responding to as the G.O.P. base rallied to Mr. Trump's defense.
Yet Mr. Trump's compounding legal woes and potential future indictments could eventually have the opposite effect -- exhausting voters, which is Mr. DeSantis's hope. A jury found Mr. Trump liable this week for sexual abuse and defamation. "When you get all these lawsuits coming at you," Mr. DeSantis told one associate recently, "it's just distracting."
'So God Made a Fighter'
The DeSantis team seemed to buy its own hype.
Days before the midterms, the DeSantis campaign released a video that cast his rise as ordained from on high. "On the eighth day, God looked down on his planned paradise and said, 'I need a protector,"' a narrator booms as Mr. DeSantis appears onscreen. "So God made a fighter."
For years, the self-confident Mr. DeSantis has relied on his own instincts and the counsel of his wife, Casey DeSantis, who posted the video, to set his political course, according to past aides and current associates. Mr. DeSantis has been written off before -- in his first primary for governor; in his first congressional primary -- so both he and his wife have gotten used to tuning out critics.
Today, allies say there are few people around who are willing to tell Mr. DeSantis he's wrong, even in private.
In late 2022, the thinking was that a decision on 2024 could wait, and Mr. Trump's midterm hangover would linger. Mr. DeSantis published a book -- "I was, you know, kind of a hot commodity," he said of writing it -- that became a best seller. And Mr. DeSantis was on the offensive, tweaking Mr. Trump with a February donor retreat held only miles from Mar-a-Lago that drew Trump contributors.
But it has been Mr. Trump who has consistently one-upped Mr. DeSantis, flying into East Palestine, Ohio, after the rail disaster there, appearing with a larger crowd in the same Iowa city days after Mr. DeSantis and swiping Florida congressional endorsements while Mr. DeSantis traveled to Washington.
One Trump endorser, Representative Lance Gooden of Texas, backed the former president only hours after attending a private group meeting with Mr. DeSantis. In an interview, Mr. Gooden likened Mr. DeSantis's decision to delay entry until after a legislative session to the example of a past Texas governor, Rick Perry, who did the same a decade ago -- and quickly flamed out of the 2012 contest.
"He's relied, much like Rick Perry did, on local political experts in his home state that just don't know the presidential landscape," Mr. Gooden said.
'I've Said Enough'
Mr. Trump has insinuated, without providing evidence, that Mr. DeSantis had inappropriate relationships with high school girls during a stint as a teacher in the early 2000s and that Mr. DeSantis might be gay.
His team has portrayed Mr. DeSantis as socially inept, and a pro-Trump super PAC distributed a video -- dubbed "Pudding Fingers" -- playing off news articles about Mr. DeSantis's uncouth eating habits.
People close to Mr. Trump have been blunt in private discussions that the hits so far are just the start: If Mr. DeSantis ever appears poised to capture the nomination, the former president will do everything he can to tear him apart.

Full text: Seven years ago, not long after Jaap van Zweden had been proclaimed the music director of the New York Philharmonic, I listened to every commercial recording of his that I could lay my hands on, to get a better sense of his conducting. I do not remember it exactly as a fun experience, when I have to remember it at all, nor one that flattered him that much.
Now that the Philharmonic's next music director has been named, it's Gustavo Dudamel's turn.
This time, the exercise is a different proposition, and thankfully nowhere near as enervating. Van Zweden was hardly a household name when the Philharmonic hired him, and even avid collectors could have been excused for not staying abreast of his latest releases. Dudamel is a Hollywood-starred celebrity who enjoys a longstanding relationship with the Deutsche Grammophon label. On May 19, he leads Mahler's Ninth Symphony in his first Philharmonic appearances since his appointment, which takes effect in 2026.
The Philharmonic has high hopes for Dudamel, 42, but it probably has not hired him first and foremost to commit agenda-setting Beethoven and Brahms to disc, though he will make records anyway. It expects him to be a grander figure, a talisman who will gladden the jaded and enthuse audiences the orchestra has yet to enthuse.
His conducting has always been somewhat overshadowed by the blinding hype that surrounds his vision of music-making as a transformative social force. Claims that he is the "savior of classical music" are no longer as common as they once were, but other clichés have endured since he shot to stardom in the mid-2000s: that he stands musically for impetuous exuberance, say, or for perpetual youth. He still has to say, as he did to The New York Times in February, that he is "not a young conductor anymore."
Dudamel himself has often suggested that he never was one. When he was 26, Bob Simon of "60 Minutes" asked if he was too young to be a conductor; he replied that he had been conducting since he was 12, adding that he still had a lot to learn. "I'm not so old. I'm 30," he told the critic Mark Swed in 2011. "But I feel old." Likewise, plenty of critics have, over the years, described Dudamel's approach as that of a much more senior musician; Alex Ross of The New Yorker has lately suggested that "he was, in a way, too mature from the start."
Perhaps, then, it is best to listen to Dudamel's recordings not only to hear a prodigy on the rise, but also for what he quickly became: a musician of significant experience who has had access to a starry cast of mentors for much of his career, and has been working with the finest orchestras in the world for nearly two decades now. On that basis, his discography ought to draw a warmer endorsement than it reasonably can.
That's not to say it's bad. Most of Dudamel's recordings are perfectly listenable, and some are impressive, like his set of the Ives symphonies with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which he has led since 2009. Few of them anger or appall, though they tend not to support the supposed Dudamel of all-star energy; some of his readings are frankly rather staid. On the whole, he comes off as a very capable musician, but one who, as of yet, has not acquired the flair for details and the brilliance of imagination that marks a conductor as extraordinary.
IT'S HARD NOW to recall fully the superheated hysteria that Dudamel and the Simón Bolívar Youth Orchestra of Venezuela generated when they started mamboing through the concert halls of Europe and North America in their yellow, red and blue jackets. I was still a teenager when I unsuspectingly attended their near-mythical concert at the London Proms in 2007; a grown adult snatched one of those jackets out of my hands as the players hurled them into the euphoric crowd. That same year, one critic called Dudamel and the Bolívars "the greatest show on Earth."
El Sistema, the education program from which the Bolívars emerged, later found itself caught in the darkening of Venezuelan politics; it took the fatal shooting of a young violist from the program, Armando Cañizales, during protests, for Dudamel to publicly oppose the regime of President Nicolás Maduro in 2017. He remains the music director of the Bolívars, who aged out of their youth orchestra billing long ago, and, last November he finally felt able to visit his homeland again after a long absence. In August, he will conduct the Bolívars for the first time in six years at the Edinburgh Festival. He sounds at his freest with this ensemble, which he calls "my family," and their records together give a good, basic sense of his musical personality.
At the heart of Dudamel's ethos is joy in musicianship, and nowhere is that more apparent than in "Fiesta," his infectious recording of Latin American music. Early on, he thrived on heightening the emotional content of a score, which explains the tempo extremes that make his Tchaikovsky -- one release of "Francesca da Rimini" and the Fifth Symphony, the other of Shakespearean fantasies -- so thrillingly explosive when he finally gets to the quick stuff. That trait he has since moderated, although a recent Los Angeles Philharmonic account of Dvorak's "New World" Symphony suggests that he has not wholly abandoned it.
Other elements of Dudamel's style are present and correct. He likes to emphasize the melodic shape of a work more than its harmonic grounding; a "Tristan" Prelude and Liebestod on an iffy Wagner collection is therefore pretty, but slack. There's a certain rhythmic fluffiness, too, a reluctance to grant rhythms a precise character. That means a fervent "Rite of Spring" falls short of being properly barbaric, and the same issue weighs down the entirely different repertoire of his 2017 New Year's Concert with the Vienna Philharmonic, whose waltzes and polkas are often charming, but equally often lead-footed.
A lot of this has to do with the sound that Dudamel prefers, or at least grew up with. The Bolívars were a colossal orchestra, a visual as well as a musical spectacle, and their tonal mass was blunt, overpowering. It's no surprise that their conductor favors a full sound. That's not necessarily a problem; what is, though, is that his sound, as microphones catch it, can seem flat.
Sometimes that doesn't matter so much: There is a patient Bruckner Ninth that satisfies despite its longueurs with the Gothenburg Symphony, which hosted Dudamel for an apprenticeship as its principal conductor from 2007 to 2012. But there isn't enough tonal differentiation to enliven his Mussorgsky from Vienna or his Strauss with the Berlin Philharmonic, and the same issue creeps into some of his Mahler, including a Fifth Symphony with the Berliners that is more cautious and altogether less entertaining than the sweeping Fifth, with an endearingly drawn-out Adagietto, that he and the Bolívars set down in 2006. A Third from Berlin is similar: lucid, but not much more.
Then there is Dudamel's Beethoven. His first recording with the Bolívars paired an unstable Fifth with a driving, bracing Seventh that is still astonishing to hear; alas, a subsequent "Eroica" is not; nor is a self-published cycle of the symphonies that dates to concerts in Venezuela in 2015. Slow and not entirely steady, this is such back-to-the-future Beethoven that it might have felt conservative two or three generations ago. I wouldn't mind that if more of those readings were like his gratifying Fourth, and had the formal security and dramatic tension that this aesthetic demands.
IF THE LOS ANGELES PHILHARMONIC indeed became "the most important orchestra in America" during Dudamel's tenure there, as the New York Times critic Zachary Woolfe wrote in 2017, that success has been only partially audible on record. The dismal economic realities of the streaming age are such that not even Dudamel, for all his fame, gets the chance to tinker with his interpretations in a studio as earlier generations of conductors could.
Nor has Dudamel been able to preserve completely the loyalty to new music that he and his players have shown in performance. His recordings of Andrew Norman's "Sustain" and Thomas Adès's "Dante" ballet are hugely valuable, though I have heard Adès conduct parts of his score more audaciously. If nothing else, Dudamel's Los Angeles discography matters as testimony to his support for John Adams: As well as pioneering accounts of "The Gospel According to the Other Mary" and "Must the Devil Have All the Good Tunes?," there is a wonderfully spirited "Slonimsky's Earbox."
Caveats duly lamented, there is still enough to go on here. Dudamel's early years at Walt Disney Concert Hall are well documented. Highlights include the exhilarating but soft-focused Bartok "Concerto for Orchestra" of his debut in January 2007, and an ambitiously mighty Brahms Fourth that won a Grammy Award. Most of the concert relays from that time are routine, though, and the uneven Mahler First from his inaugural gala in 2009 is worth hearing mostly as a baseline for the improvement in his later Los Angeles Mahler recordings. The warm, compassionate Ninth from 2012 could do with more snap and bite, but a tightly controlled Eighth from 2019 is effective.
What remains odd, however, is that records that should have been easy home runs are not. It took five years for Deutsche Grammophon to release Dudamel's "Nutcracker" after concerts in 2013, and although it is agreeable enough on a first listen, on a second it becomes clear why: rhythmic timidity, along with colors that are a few shades duller than fairy-light bright. For every touching moment in Dudamel's 2019 homage to his friend John Williams, similar reservations lurk. When Williams conducts the "Imperial March," he can both scare you with the Empire's fully-operational battle power, as with the Berlin Philharmonic, and mock its vainglory, as with the Vienna Philharmonic. Dudamel makes no comment on it at all.
It's these kinds of things that make you wonder. The New York Philharmonic has hailed Dudamel as Leonard Bernstein resurrected, as the man who will return the orchestra to the stature that it has, in truth, enjoyed only periodically in its history. But whatever else Bernstein was, he was a distinctive conductor. Who knows? Maybe Dudamel can become one, too. But he has work to do.

In November, Rep. Byron Donalds scored a coveted speaking slot: introducing Gov. Ron DeSantis after a landslide reelection turned the swing state of Florida deep red. Standing onstage at a victory party for DeSantis in Tampa, Donalds praised him as “America’s governor.”
By April, Donalds was seated at a table next to another Florida Republican: Donald Trump. He was at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s private club, for a multicourse dinner with nine other House Republicans from Florida who had spurned their home-state governor to endorse the former president’s 2024 run. Red “Make America Great Again” hats decorated their place settings.
In six short months from November to May, DeSantis’ 2024 run has faltered before it has even begun.
Allies have abandoned him. Tales of his icy interpersonal touch have spread. Donors have groused. And a legislative session in Tallahassee designed to burnish his conservative credentials has instead coincided with a drop in the polls.
His decision not to begin any formal campaign until after the Florida legislative session — allowing him to cast himself as a conservative fighter who not only won but actually delivered results — instead opened a window of opportunity for Trump. The former president filled the void with personal attacks and a heavy rotation of negative advertising from his super political action committee. Combined with DeSantis’ cocooning himself in the right-wing media and the Trump team’s success in outflanking him on several fronts, the governor has lost control of his own national narrative.
Now, as DeSantis’ Tallahassee-based operation pivots to formally entering the race in the coming weeks, DeSantis and his allies are retooling for a more aggressive new phase. His staunchest supporters privately acknowledge that DeSantis needs to recalibrate a political outreach and media strategy that has allowed Trump to define the race.
Changes are afoot. DeSantis is building a strong Iowa operation. He has been calling influential Republicans in Iowa and is rolling out a large slate of state legislator endorsements before a weekend trip there.
“He definitely indicated that if he gets in, he will work exceptionally hard — nothing will be below him,” said Bob Vander Plaats, an influential Iowa evangelical leader whom DeSantis hosted recently for a meal at the governor’s mansion. “I think he understands — I emphasized that Iowa’s a retail politics state. You need to shake people’s hands, look them in the eye.”
Still, his central electability pitch — MAGA without the mess — has been badly bruised.
A book tour that was supposed to have introduced him nationally was marked by missteps that deepened concerns about his readiness for the biggest stage. He took positions on two pressing domestic and international issues — abortion and the war in Ukraine — that generated second-guessing and backlash among some allies and would-be benefactors. And the moves he has made to appeal to the hard right — escalating his feud with Disney, signing a strict six-week abortion ban — have unnerved donors who are worried about the general election.
“I was in the DeSantis camp,” said Andrew Sabin, a metals magnate who gave the Florida governor $50,000 last year. “But he started opening his mouth, and a lot of big donors said his views aren’t tolerable.” He specifically cited abortion and Ukraine.
Three billionaires who are major GOP donors — Steve Wynn, Ike Perlmutter and Thomas Peterffy, a past DeSantis patron who has publicly soured on him — dined recently with Vivek Ramaswamy, a 37-year-old long-shot Republican.
The early months of 2023 have exposed a central challenge for DeSantis. He needs to stitch together an unwieldy ideological coalition bridging both anti-Trump Republicans and Trump supporters who are nonetheless considering turning the page on the past president. Hitting and hugging Trump at the same time has bedeviled rivals since Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, tried to do so in 2016, and Cruz veterans fill key roles in DeSantis’ campaign and his super PAC.
Allies of both leading Republicans caution that it’s still early.
DeSantis has more than $100 million stored across various pro-DeSantis accounts. He is building goodwill with state party leaders by headlining fundraisers. He remains, in public polls, the most serious rival to Trump. And a supportive super PAC called Never Back Down is staffing up across more than a dozen states, has already spent more than $10 million on television ads and has peppered early states with direct mail.
DeSantis supporters point to polls showing that the governor remains well-liked by Republicans.
“The hits aren’t working,” said Kristin Davison, chief operating officer of Never Back Down. “His favorability has not changed.”
The DeSantis team declined to provide any comment for this story.
Six months ago, as Republicans were blaming Trump for the party’s 2022 midterm underperformance, a high-flying DeSantis made the traditional political decision that he would govern first in early 2023 and campaign second. The rush of conservative priorities that DeSantis has turned into law in Florida — on guns, immigration, abortion, school vouchers, opposing China — is expected to form the backbone of his campaign.
“Now, the governor can create momentum by spending time publicly touting his endless accomplishments, calling supporters and engaging more publicly to push back on the false narratives his potential competitors are spewing,” said Nick Iarossi, a lobbyist in Florida and a longtime DeSantis supporter.
A turning point this year for Trump was his Manhattan indictment, which DeSantis waffled on responding to as the GOP base rallied to Trump’s defense.
Yet Trump’s compounding legal woes and potential future indictments could eventually have the opposite effect — exhausting voters, which is DeSantis’ hope. A jury found Trump liable this past week for sexual abuse and defamation. “When you get all these lawsuits coming at you,” DeSantis told one associate recently, “it’s just distracting.”
‘So God Made a Fighter’
The DeSantis team seemed to buy its own hype.
Days before the midterms, the DeSantis campaign released a video that cast his rise as ordained from on high. “On the eighth day, God looked down on his planned paradise and said, ‘I need a protector,’” a narrator booms as DeSantis appears on-screen. “So God made a fighter.”
For years, the self-confident DeSantis has relied on his own instincts and the counsel of his wife, Casey DeSantis, who posted the video, to set his political course, according to past aides and current associates. DeSantis has been written off before — in his first primary for governor; in his first congressional primary — so both he and his wife have gotten used to tuning out critics.
Today, allies say there are few people around who are willing to tell DeSantis he’s wrong, even in private.
In late 2022, the thinking was that a decision on 2024 could wait, and Trump’s midterm hangover would linger. DeSantis published a book — “I was, you know, kind of a hot commodity,” he said of writing it — that became a bestseller. And DeSantis was on the offensive, tweaking Trump with a February donor retreat held only miles from Mar-a-Lago that drew Trump contributors.
But it has been Trump who has consistently one-upped DeSantis, flying into East Palestine, Ohio, after the rail disaster there, appearing with a larger crowd in the same Iowa city days after DeSantis and swiping Florida congressional endorsements while DeSantis traveled to Washington.
One Trump endorser, Rep. Lance Gooden of Texas, backed the former president only hours after attending a private group meeting with DeSantis. In an interview, Gooden likened DeSantis’ decision to delay entry until after a legislative session to the example of a past Texas governor, Rick Perry, who did the same a decade ago — and quickly flamed out of the 2012 contest.
“He’s relied, much like Rick Perry did, on local political experts in his home state that just don’t know the presidential landscape,” Gooden said.
‘He Hasn’t Been Scuffed Up’
Trump has insinuated, without providing evidence, that DeSantis had inappropriate relationships with high school girls during a stint as a teacher in the early 2000s and that DeSantis might be gay.
His team has portrayed DeSantis as socially inept, and a pro-Trump super PAC distributed a video — dubbed “Pudding Fingers” — playing off news articles about DeSantis’ uncouth eating habits.
People close to Trump have been blunt in private discussions that the hits so far are just the start: If DeSantis ever appears poised to capture the nomination, the former president will do everything he can to tear him apart.
Beginning with his response to the coronavirus outbreak, DeSantis’ national rise has been uniquely powered by his ability to make the right enemies: in academia, in the news media, among liberal activists and at the White House. But Trump’s broadsides and some of his own actions have put DeSantis crosswise with the right for the first time. It has been a disorienting experience for the DeSantis operation, according to allies.
For the past three years, DeSantis has had the luxury of completely shutting out what he pejoratively brands the “national regime media” or “the corporate media” — although Rupert Murdoch’s Fox Corp. does not, in his view, count as corporate media.
This strategy served DeSantis well in Florida. But avoiding sit-down interviews with skeptical journalists has left him out of practice as he prepares for the most intense scrutiny of his career.
“The Murdochs encapsulated him in a bubble and force-fed him to a conservative audience,” said Steve Bannon, a former strategist for Trump. “He hasn’t been scuffed up. He hasn’t had these questions put in his grill.”
Even in friendly settings, DeSantis has stumbled. In a February interview with The Times of London, a Murdoch property, DeSantis cut off questions after the reporter pushed him on how he thought President Joe Biden should handle Ukraine differently.
Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson was so irked by DeSantis’ evasion that he sent a detailed questionnaire to potential Republican presidential candidates to force them to state their positions on the war, according to two people familiar with his decision.
In a written response, DeSantis characterized Russia’s invasion as a “territorial dispute.” Republican hawks and some of DeSantis’ top donors were troubled. In public, the governor soon cleaned up his statement to say Russia had not had “a right” to invade. In private, DeSantis tried to calm supporters by noting that his statement had not taken a position against aid to Ukraine.
While DeSantis has stuck to his preferred way of doing things, Trump has given seats on his plane to reporters from outlets that have published harsh stories about him. And despite having spent years calling CNN “fake news,” Trump recently attended a CNN town hall.
DeSantis allies said the governor would begrudgingly bring in some of the “national regime media.” Some early proof: The governor’s tight-lipped team invited a Politico columnist to Tallahassee and supplied rare on-the-record access.
‘I Was a Bit Insulted’
Not long after DeSantis had won in a landslide last fall, incoming freshman Rep. Cory Mills, R-Fla., called the governor’s team to try to thank him for his support. Mills had campaigned on the eve of the election with Casey DeSantis and had appeared with the governor, too. “I called to show my appreciation and never even got a call back,” Mills said in an interview. “To be honest with you, I was a bit insulted by it.”
The lack of relationships on Capitol Hill became a public headache in April when Trump rolled out what eventually became 10 Florida House Republican endorsements during DeSantis’ trip to Washington.
Donors who contributed to DeSantis’ previous campaigns tell stories of meetings in which the candidate looked as if he would rather be anywhere else. He fiddled with his phone, showed no interest in his hosts and escaped as quickly as possible. But people who have recently met with DeSantis say he has been far more engaged. At recent Wisconsin and New Hampshire events, the governor worked the room as he had rarely done before.
The governor and his team have had internal conversations acknowledging the need for him to engage in the basics of political courtship: small talk, handshaking, eye contact.
For his part, Trump recently relished hosting the Florida House Republicans who had endorsed him.
On one side of him was Mills. On the other was Donalds, who had introduced DeSantis on election night and who had been in DeSantis’ orbit since helping with debate prep during DeSantis’ 2018 run for governor.
Donalds declined an interview. But footage of those private debate-prep sessions, first reported by ABC News, show DeSantis trying to formulate an answer to a question that will define his imminent 2024 run: how to disagree with Trump without appearing disagreeable to Trump supporters.
“I have to frame it in a way,” DeSantis said then, “that’s not going to piss off all his voters.”

A Long Journey To an Epiphany: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: In a spoiler-filled interview, the writer-director discusses the characters' surprising end points and his relief at bringing the trilogy to a close.
When a film is billed as the last installment of a trilogy, fans can't help but speculate: Who's going to die? A blockbuster franchise rarely wraps without a few significant casualties, each noble sacrifice underscoring the definitive end to come.
But with "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3," the writer-director James Gunn wanted to finish the trilogy on his own terms, even if that meant circumventing fan expectations. (Major spoilers follow.)
The most surprising thing about the conclusion of this long-running Marvel series is that all of the main characters survive and even thrive. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) returns to Earth, the home planet he had avoided since childhood, and passes leadership of the Guardians to Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper), who forms a new team featuring Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) and their reformed antagonist Adam Warlock (Will Poulter). Nebula (Karen Gillan) and Drax (Dave Bautista) stay behind to help the citizen settlers who've moved into the bustling space-base Knowhere, while Mantis (Pom Klementieff) departs on a solo journey to better understand herself.
And Gamora (Zoe Saldaña)? Well, her path through the Marvel universe has been complicated: The Gamora we originally knew was murdered by her father, Thanos, back in "Avengers: Infinity War" (2018), then supplanted by a time-traveling variant who had no history with the Guardians. That new version gets roped into assisting the Guardians in "Vol. 3," and though she comes to understand what the other Gamora might have felt for a still lovestruck Quill, she can't get there herself and bids the group a bittersweet goodbye.
The endings all feel more like new beginnings, and that's a reflection of the deep affection Gunn feels for his ensemble: He wants the best for these characters, particularly Rocket, whom he admits to a "strange connection" with. He's even had many of these outcomes in mind since he wrote the first "Guardians" (2014), though there was a time when he wondered if he'd get to see them through: As preproduction began on "Vol. 3," he was briefly fired over a controversy involving his old tweets.
Though Disney eventually rehired Gunn, making the movie had to wait. He had already been poached by Warner Bros. and DC Comics to direct "The Suicide Squad," and that budding relationship proved so fruitful that Gunn will now oversee a total rehaul of DC's slate, which will begin with a new take on Superman that he will direct. That means "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3" is not just the end of a trilogy but the culmination of Gunn's decade at Marvel.
How does he feel now that it's all come to a close? "Sad and proud," he said by phone earlier this week, as he prepared to discuss the ending of "Vol. 3" in depth. "But I feel like we did what we set out to do and I don't think we could have done it much better than how we did it."
All of the Guardians of the Galaxy survive the film and head out on new paths. Were you ever tempted to bring any of these characters to a more final end?
Gamora was going to die originally in "Vol. 2" [2017], and then we talked about it happening in "Infinity War" and that worked better for the story. But the rest of them, I always knew where they were going. I knew that the whole trilogy is about Rocket, who we think of as a supporting character, becoming the captain of the Guardians.
The arc with Peter Quill, in some ways, you can look at as that of many people who have experienced childhood trauma. He was by his mother's bedside when she died, and he ran away and went into outer space -- which, for other people, could be shutting off from the world -- and stayed there for a long time until he came to the realization as an adult that he needed to go back to Earth. That, for me, was always his journey.
Nebula becomes a leader, but a different sort of leader from where she was. Mantis goes off on her own and takes care of herself because she lived by others' rules her entire life. Drax realizes that he's a father and that's what he's really good at -- he's not a destroyer. All those things, some more clearly than others, were in my mind from the first movie.
Few Marvel series were as affected by the events of "Infinity War" and "Endgame" as "Guardians of the Galaxy." How did you feel about having a lot of major plot points happen outside the films of your own trilogy?
A lot? I think there was only one.
Well, Gamora's death is the big one, but even her first kiss with Quill comes in "Infinity War" after the first two "Guardians" movies appear to be building to it.
I begged them to have that kiss in the movie, because it was necessary to really cement their relationship. I had a kiss in "Vol. 2" that I cut -- it was awesome, but it came in a weird time. At the end of "Vol. 2," you establish the fact that they have feelings for each other pretty distinctly, but in "Infinity War," we needed to establish that they were now boyfriend-girlfriend and this was a normal thing for them. It wasn't really about the kiss, it was about showing that they were now a couple.
Was there ever an idea that Gamora would not come back in any form in "Vol. 3," and Quill would have to deal with her absence?
That was a possibility, yes. He would be dealing with her loss, but she wouldn't come back and confront him in this different way. I toyed with it a lot as I was writing the script.
In another sort of movie, the new Gamora would have fallen in love with Quill, too. Instead, Quill gets to know her and eventually realizes he has to let his love go.
It's something we do a lot in relationships anyway: We expect someone who reminds us of somebody from the past to be that somebody from the past. Especially with women, Peter Quill defines people around him to suit his own needs as opposed to really looking and seeing who they actually are as human beings. And Gamora is just not the same Gamora. She's a different person.
There are a few moments where it feels like you're testing the chemistry between Quill and Nebula, which is intriguingly spiky. Did you ever think of going there with them?
I never thought about fully going there, but do I think that Nebula, emotionally, is sort of that mean schoolgirl who's not going to show her feelings to anybody. Karen thinks that Nebula has a little bit of a crush on Quill that she doesn't quite know how to put together, and it makes sense because as we come to them in "Vol. 3," we realize that they are the two leaders of the Guardians. I think it's very normal in any close friendship to have some sort of occasional romantic or crush-like feelings.
When you're crafting all these character endings, how much do you have to factor in the actor's willingness to continue in the role? For instance, Dave Bautista has been pretty vocal about saying he's finished. Does that affect the way you wrap up Drax's story as opposed to Quill's, since Chris Pratt is open to continuing?
Yeah, a little bit. Both Zoe and Dave have been very clear they're not going to continue -- likewise, me, actually. Chris is open to doing more stuff, although I think he has to be convinced. It does change some things: Like, I wouldn't have had Dave in the post-credits scene. But I'm not sure if much would have changed beyond that.
At what point in conceiving all of this did you know that you wanted to end this trilogy with a dance sequence set to "Dog Days Are Over" from Florence + the Machine? It's a lot of responsibility to be the last music cue of such a song-laden franchise.
I've known it for a few years. I've known it far before I started writing the script, since I was writing "Vol. 2." I've been a fan of that album and that song since it came out, and it's pretty cool because I just got an email from Florence Welch, who posted herself watching the movie and crying on TikTok yesterday. I think it's probably the greatest pop song of the 21st century.
In previous movies, you did the motion-capture dancing for Groot yourself. Did you also do it in the "Dog Days Are Over" scene?
Yeah, and it was a high point in my life, really. My brother Sean is dancing for Rocket, and in the moment we were shooting the wide shot and dancing toward each other, it was surreal and beautiful and wonderful. We've been goofing around and playing with Fisher-Price characters since we were kids in our parents' basement, and now we're on the biggest set I've ever been on with gigantic Tinker Toys instead of smaller ones, but with that same purity and imagination we had as kids. Everybody was crying as it was happening. It was a really powerful moment.
You directed all three films of this trilogy, which is a rarity at Marvel. Did you know from the beginning that you wanted to be at the helm throughout?
Yes. Everyone knows I was gone for a while, then I came back, and the reason I came back -- because, frankly, I might not have otherwise -- is I needed to tell Rocket's story. I couldn't have that stuff inside of me and not express it. I have a strange connection to that character where I feel like he deserves everything. This is a story about a character who goes from being a little smuggling thief to becoming the leader of the greatest team the universe has ever known. And his back story, the pain of where he came from, all the seeds that I dropped from "Vol. 1" when Peter Quill sees the injuries on his back, all of those things were leading to something, and it just felt stunted to cut it off there. It felt like I was setting all of that up and not finishing it. That was a hard pill for me to swallow.
Most of these characters started the trilogy in a more selfish place, but few of them had further to go than Rocket.
I was very, very careful through all the movies, including the "Avengers" movies and "Thor" and everything, that Rocket never does one single action that is for anyone other than himself or his friends. He's not a hero like the rest of them. Morally, he's much more stunted than Nebula is by the end of the "Avengers" series. He has just cut himself off completely from feeling for people, and at the end of "Vol. 3," in that moment where he accepts himself by taking those raccoons and then starts looking around the cages, that's the moment to me where he sees, "Oh my God, everything is me. We're all a part of this universe, and every life has purpose, meaning, and is worthy of respect." That's who he is now: He's not a bad guy, he's strictly a good guy.
So what does it mean to you that Rocket is the one in charge when this film ends, just as you're coming into your own as the one in charge at DC? Did you have to go through your own journey to get to a place where you'd feel comfortable with that kind of responsibility?
Oh, there's no doubt that my journey is similar to Rocket's. When it comes to those things I used to push other people away, accepting myself as I am, and accepting other people's love, it's been something that I've struggled with over the years and come to terms with much more than I have in the past.
Now that you've managed to tell that story, what's the overriding feeling? Is it satisfaction? Is it relief?
Satisfaction, relief and just a real gentle pat on my back going, "OK, now we've got the next phase to work on, and I'm comfortable doing that." Whatever Marvel does with those characters, I can't wait. I hope they use them. I can't wait to see another filmmaker take on the Guardians, and I hope that they do it in a way that they take ownership of the characters. But I feel good, I feel happy. Making the friendships that I made on this film series and having people in my life who are my closest allies -- I mean, I've been to five weddings of the Guardians. I was at Chris's wedding, Chris spoke at my wedding. Pom was one of Karen's bridesmaids. It's a great little group of people and I am really, really lucky.

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- When the tenor Russell Thomas appeared at the Los Angeles Opera in 2017, Plácido Domingo, the company's general director, asked him to return one day to sing the title role in Verdi's "Otello." It was a notable invitation coming from Domingo, the leading Otello of his day, who sang the role in 1986 at the very first performance of the Los Angeles company.
Six years later, Thomas is back in Los Angeles starring as Otello in a six-performance run that begins Saturday. But Domingo, who had initially contemplated singing opposite him as the opera's villain, Iago, is gone, having resigned in 2019 at the age of 78 amid allegations that he had sexually harassed multiple women over the course of his career.
So it is that the company's season-ending production of "Otello" is at once a look back to its foundations and a glimpse into its future, as the Los Angeles Opera charts its course in a post-Domingo era at a moment when it faces the same challenges as other companies in recovering from the loss of audience members and revenues since the pandemic.
"It's slow -- it's much slower than I would have desired," Christopher Koelsch, the company's president and chief executive officer, said of the audience's return. But he noted that attendance was in line with what other opera houses across the country were seeing these days, and that there were signs that the company was overcoming its recent setbacks. "By most criteria, other than audience attendance, the company is in significantly better shape than it's been in its 38-year history," he said.
Attendance so far this season has averaged 64 percent of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion's 3,033-seat capacity -- still short of the 83 percent the company logged in 2018-2019, but showing improvement since it first reopened after the shutdown. Two productions that sold well, and sometimes sold out, reflected the company's efforts to balance new works with the classics: "Omar," the new Rhiannon Giddens and Michael Abels opera based on the autobiography of an enslaved Muslim scholar that won the Pulitzer Prize for music this week, and "The Marriage of Figaro," the Mozart comedy.
In a season when the Metropolitan Opera in New York was forced to dip into its endowment to make up for declining revenues, the Los Angeles Opera's endowment is at a record high -- $ 74.1 million, up from $ 28.8 million in 2012 -- reflecting a continued influx of contributions, said Keith Leonard, the chairman of its board. It survived the downturn without running a deficit, relying on salary reductions, a handful of layoffs, a $ 5 million five-year loan against the endowment, and federal aid.
Domingo's downfall stunned Los Angeles and its opera company, which had been so closely identified with the star tenor, who had been singing there since the 1960s and was instrumental in the creation of the company. An investigation by the Los Angeles Opera found accusations that he had engaged in "inappropriate conduct" with women "to be credible," but did not find evidence that he had engaged in "a quid pro quo or retaliated against any woman by not casting or otherwise hiring her at L.A. Opera." When he left, the company pledged to strengthen its measures for preventing misconduct.
It is difficult to say precisely whether attendance was affected by the departure of Domingo, given that the coronavirus shutdown followed so soon afterward. For many years his performances had drawn the biggest crowds, and his image was as integral to the company's marketing as Gustavo Dudamel's is for its neighbor, the Los Angeles Philharmonic. "It is unmistakably a loss because he's such a titanic figure in the world," Koelsch said. But, he added, "a scientific controlled experiment is impossible here."
The opera never filled the general director position after Domingo left; those responsibilities were picked up by Koelsch, who already was running its day-to-day operations.
Domingo, in an email interview, said that in his view, the company had continued to thrive even after what he made clear was his unhappy departure from a position that had been a high point of his career.
"I saw it grow and I believe that I gave it my all, to the point that it became one of the leading opera houses in the U.S. and the world," he said, adding: "I see the programming and the seasons appear to be very diverse, with a big focus on new works that can attract new audiences and I think this is a great added value for all the people of Los Angeles."
With a $ 44 million operating budget, the Los Angeles Opera is the fifth largest company in the United States. Despite its (by opera standards) short existence, and with its modest roster of six productions a season (compared with 23 this season at the Met), it has been establishing itself as one of the more adventurous mainstream opera houses in the country: working to be more edgy than stuffy.
Even before Domingo left, the company -- aware of his age, and that an institution should not be too closely tied to any one person -- had been planning for its future, working to forge an identity that would combine war horses with more contemporary work.
For a decade it has been working with Beth Morrison Projects, which has been at the vanguard of producing contemporary opera: they collaborated on the world premiere of Ellen Reid's opera "p r i s m" in 2018 at Los Angeles' smaller Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theater, or REDCAT, and the work won a Pulitzer Prize. And in 2020, "Eurydice," by Matthew Aucoin, who was then the opera's artist-in-residence, had its world premiere at the Dorothy Chandler before moving to the Metropolitan Opera.
"L.A. Opera is doing very, very well," said Marc A. Scorca, the president of Opera America, a nonprofit service organization for opera companies. "Of all the major companies in the country, it is the youngest and is still discovering new audiences and new momentum as L.A. continues to build out its cultural infrastructure. I am very optimistic about the company."
This spring, it collaborated with Beth Morrison Projects to present two operas by Emma O'Halloran, the Irish composer, at the 250-seat black box theater inside REDCAT.
One of them, a 70-minute, two-person work called "Trade," explores an emotionally unsettling hotel room liaison in working-class Dublin between an older married man and a younger male prostitute, hardly the kind of story that has historically been presented on the opera stage.
"When we started this relationship, most opera companies were not doing new work," Morrison said. "L.A. Opera, in terms of the big companies, was very much ahead of the curve on that. They believe in experimental work, and they believe we need to have these things to make sure that opera evolves into the future and brings in new audiences."
Now other large companies, including the Met, are programming more new works in hopes of attracting new audiences.
If this is a recovery, it is still a tentative one; crucial questions about how audience behavior has changed remain to be answered. James Conlon, who has been the opera's music director since 2006, after being recruited for the job by Domingo, said that the opera was "working very hard to regain that audience."
"My own suspicion," he said, "is that a lot of the competition is not going to be other venues but people who are sitting home who became used to making more use of their televisions."
That is a particular issue in Los Angeles, considering the early evening traffic that can make trips downtown to the Music Center an exhausting, hourslong adventure.
When the company was first formed, there was much talk about whether Los Angeles had an appetite for grand opera. "Up until the early 80s the received opinion by many of the leading figures at the Music Center was that 'L.A. is not an opera town' and 'L.A. can afford a great symphony or a great opera, but not both,"' said Don Franzen, an original member of the opera's board of directors.
But 38 years after that opening night, that question appears to have been answered.
"Los Angeles is very much an opera town -- I see the growth of the company and its success as a testimony to that," Scorca, of Opera America, said.
Now Thomas, the company's current artist-in-residence, is getting ready to take his place singing the demanding role that launched the company: Otello. He recalled that invitation from Domingo, who had floated the idea of appearing with him in the lower-lying baritone role of Iago, since he had stopped singing high tenor roles.
"He was very interested in my singing Otello, and he and I performing the show together," Thomas said the other day. "I would have loved that to happen. I would have loved to be onstage with one of the legendary singers in opera. Things happen the way they do."

Full text: Enlarge this image.
When a film is billed as the last installment of a trilogy, fans can’t help but speculate: Who’s going to die? A blockbuster franchise rarely wraps without a few significant casualties, each noble sacrifice underscoring the definitive end to come.
But with “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” writer-director James Gunn wanted to finish the trilogy on his own terms, even if that meant circumventing fan expectations. (Major spoilers follow.)
The most surprising thing about the conclusion of this long-running Marvel series is that all of the main characters survive and even thrive. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) returns to Earth, the home planet he had avoided since childhood, and passes leadership of the Guardians to Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper), who forms a new team featuring Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) and their reformed antagonist Adam Warlock (Will Poulter). Nebula (Karen Gillan) and Drax (Dave Bautista) stay behind to help the citizen settlers who’ve moved into the bustling space-base Knowhere, while Mantis (Pom Klementieff) departs on a solo journey to better understand herself.
And Gamora (Zoe Saldaña)? Well, her path through the Marvel universe has been complicated: The Gamora we originally knew was murdered by her father, Thanos, back in “Avengers: Infinity War” (2018), then supplanted by a time-traveling variant who had no history with the Guardians. That new version gets roped into assisting the Guardians in “Vol. 3,” and though she comes to understand what the other Gamora might have felt for a still lovestruck Quill, she can’t get there herself and bids the group a bittersweet goodbye.
The endings all feel more like new beginnings, and that’s a reflection of the deep affection Gunn feels for his ensemble: He wants the best for these characters, particularly Rocket, whom he admits to a “strange connection” with. He’s even had many of these outcomes in mind since he wrote the first “Guardians” (2014), although there was a time when he wondered if he’d get to see them through: As preproduction began on “Vol. 3,” he was briefly fired over a controversy involving his old tweets.
Though Disney eventually rehired Gunn, making the movie had to wait. He had been poached by Warner Bros. and DC Comics to direct “The Suicide Squad,” and that budding relationship proved so fruitful that Gunn will now oversee a total rehaul of DC’s slate, which will begin with a new take on Superman that he will direct. That means “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” is not just the end of a trilogy but the culmination of Gunn’s decade at Marvel.
How does he feel now that it’s all come to a close?
“Sad and proud,” he said by phone as he prepared to discuss the ending of “Vol. 3” in depth. “But I feel like we did what we set out to do, and I don’t think we could have done it much better than how we did it.”
Q: All of the Guardians of the Galaxy survive the film and head out on new paths. Were you ever tempted to bring any of these characters to a more final end?
A: Gamora was going to die originally in “Vol. 2” [2017], and then we talked about it happening in “Infinity War,” and that worked better for the story. But the rest of them, I always knew where they were going. I knew that the whole trilogy is about Rocket, who we think of as a supporting character, becoming the captain of the Guardians.
The arc with Peter Quill, in some ways, you can look at as that of many people who have experienced childhood trauma. He was by his mother’s bedside when she died, and he ran away and went into outer space — which, for other people, could be shutting off from the world — and stayed there for a long time until he came to the realization as an adult that he needed to go back to Earth. That, for me, was always his journey.
Nebula becomes a leader, but a different sort of leader from where she was. Mantis goes off on her own and takes care of herself because she lived by others’ rules her entire life. Drax realizes that he’s a father and that’s what he’s really good at — he’s not a destroyer. All those things, some more clearly than others, were in my mind from the first movie.
Q: Few Marvel series were as affected by the events of “Infinity War” and “Endgame” as “Guardians of the Galaxy.” How did you feel about having a lot of major plot points happen outside the films of your own trilogy?
A: A lot? I think there was only one.
Q: Well, Gamora’s death is the big one, but even her first kiss with Quill comes in “Infinity War” after the first two “Guardians” movies appear to be building to it.
A: I begged them to have that kiss in the movie, because it was necessary to really cement their relationship. I had a kiss in “Vol. 2” that I cut; it was awesome, but it came in a weird time. At the end of “Vol. 2,” you establish the fact that they have feelings for each other pretty distinctly, but in “Infinity War,” we needed to establish that they were now boyfriend-girlfriend and this was a normal thing for them. It wasn’t really about the kiss; it was about showing that they were now a couple.
Q: Was there ever an idea that Gamora would not come back in any form in “Vol. 3,” and Quill would have to deal with her absence?
A: That was a possibility, yes. He would be dealing with her loss, but she wouldn’t come back and confront him in this different way. I toyed with it a lot as I was writing the script.
Q: In another sort of movie, the new Gamora would have fallen in love with Quill, too. Instead, Quill gets to know her and eventually realizes he has to let his love go.
A: It’s something we do a lot in relationships anyway: We expect someone who reminds us of somebody from the past to be that somebody from the past. Especially with women, Peter Quill defines people around him to suit his own needs as opposed to really looking and seeing who they actually are as human beings. And Gamora is just not the same Gamora. She’s a different person.
Q: There are a few moments where it feels like you’re testing the chemistry between Quill and Nebula, which is intriguingly spiky. Did you ever think of going there with them?
A: I never thought about fully going there, but do I think that Nebula, emotionally, is sort of that mean schoolgirl who’s not going to show her feelings to anybody. Karen thinks that Nebula has a little bit of a crush on Quill that she doesn’t quite know how to put together, and it makes sense because as we come to them in “Vol. 3,” we realize that they are the two leaders of the Guardians. I think it’s very normal in any close friendship to have some sort of occasional romantic or crushlike feelings.
Q: When you’re crafting all these character endings, how much do you have to factor in the actor’s willingness to continue in the role? For instance, Dave Bautista has been pretty vocal about saying he’s finished. Does that affect the way you wrap up Drax’s story as opposed to Quill’s, since Chris Pratt is open to continuing?
A: Yeah, a little bit. Both Zoe and Dave have been very clear they’re not going to continue — likewise, me, actually. Chris is open to doing more stuff, although I think he has to be convinced. It does change some things: Like, I wouldn’t have had Dave in the post-credits scene. But I’m not sure if much would have changed beyond that.
Q: At what point in conceiving all of this did you know that you wanted to end this trilogy with a dance sequence set to “Dog Days Are Over” from Florence + the Machine ? It’s a lot of responsibility to be the last music cue of such a song-laden franchise.
A: I’ve known it for a few years. I’ve known it far before I started writing the script, since I was writing “Vol. 2.” I’ve been a fan of that album and that song since it came out, and it’s pretty cool because I just got an email from Florence Welch, who posted herself watching the movie and crying on TikTok yesterday. I think it’s probably the greatest pop song of the 21st century.
Q: In previous movies, you did the motion-capture dancing for Groot yourself. Did you also do it in the “Dog Days Are Over” scene?
A: Yeah, and it was a high point in my life, really. My brother Sean is dancing for Rocket, and in the moment we were shooting the wide shot and dancing toward each other, it was surreal and beautiful and wonderful. We’ve been goofing around and playing with Fisher-Price characters since we were kids in our parents’ basement, and now we’re on the biggest set I’ve ever been on with gigantic Tinker Toys instead of smaller ones, but with that same purity and imagination we had as kids. Everybody was crying as it was happening. It was a really powerful moment.
Q: You directed all three films of this trilogy, which is a rarity at Marvel. Did you know from the beginning that you wanted to be at the helm throughout?
A: Yes. Everyone knows I was gone for a while, then I came back, and the reason I came back — because, frankly, I might not have otherwise — is I needed to tell Rocket’s story. I couldn’t have that stuff inside of me and not express it. I have a strange connection to that character where I feel like he deserves everything.
This is a story about a character who goes from being a little smuggling thief to becoming the leader of the greatest team the universe has ever known. And his backstory, the pain of where he came from, all the seeds that I dropped from “Vol. 1” when Peter Quill sees the injuries on his back, all of those things were leading to something, and it just felt stunted to cut it off there. It felt like I was setting all of that up and not finishing it. That was a hard pill for me to swallow.

Q: Now that you’ve managed to tell that story, what’s the overriding feeling? Is it satisfaction? Is it relief?
A: Satisfaction, relief and just a real gentle pat on my back going, “OK, now we’ve got the next phase to work on, and I’m comfortable doing that.” Whatever Marvel does with those characters, I can’t wait. I hope they use them. I can’t wait to see another filmmaker take on the Guardians, and I hope that they do it in a way that they take ownership of the characters. But I feel good, I feel happy.
Making the friendships that I made on this film series and having people in my life who are my closest allies — I mean, I’ve been to five weddings of the Guardians. I was at Chris’ wedding. Chris spoke at my wedding. Pom was one of Karen’s bridesmaids. It’s a great little group of people and I am really, really lucky.

LOS ANGELES — When tenor Russell Thomas appeared at the Los Angeles Opera in 2017, Plácido Domingo, the company’s general director, asked him to return one day to sing the title role in Giuseppe Verdi’s “Otello.” It was a notable invitation coming from Domingo, the leading Otello of his day, who sang the role in 1986 at the very first performance of the Los Angeles company.
Six years later, Thomas is back in LA starring as Otello in a six-performance run that begins Saturday. But Domingo, who had initially contemplated singing opposite him as the opera’s villain, Iago, is gone, forced out in 2019 at the age of 78 amid allegations that he had sexually harassed multiple women over the course of his career.
So it is that the company’s season-ending production of “Otello” is at once a look back to its foundations and a glimpse into its future, as the Los Angeles Opera charts its course in a post-Domingo era at a moment when it faces the same challenges as other companies in recovering from the loss of audience members and revenues since the pandemic.
“It’s slow — it’s much slower than I would have desired,” president and CEO Christopher Koelsch said of the audience’s return. But he noted that attendance is in line with what other opera houses across the country are seeing these days, and that there are signs that the company is overcoming its recent setbacks.
“By most criteria, other than audience attendance, the company is in significantly better shape than it’s been in its 38-year history,” he said.
Attendance this season has averaged 64% of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion’s 3,033-seat capacity — still short of the 83% the company logged in 2018-19 but showing improvement since it first reopened after the shutdown. Two productions that sold well, and sometimes sold out, reflected the company’s efforts to balance new works with the classics: “Omar,” the new Rhiannon Giddens and Michael Abels opera based on the autobiography of an enslaved Muslim scholar that won the Pulitzer Prize for music Monday, and “The Marriage of Figaro,” the comedy by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
In a season when the Metropolitan Opera in New York was forced to dip into its endowment to make up for declining revenues, the Los Angeles Opera’s endowment is at a record high — $74.1 million, up from $28.8 million in 2012 — reflecting a continued influx of contributions, said Keith Leonard, the chairman of its board. It survived the downturn without running a deficit, relying on salary reductions, a handful of layoffs, a $5 million five-year loan against the endowment and federal aid.
Domingo’s downfall stunned Los Angeles and its opera company, which had been so closely identified with the star tenor, who had been singing there since the 1960s and was instrumental in the creation of the company. An investigation by the Los Angeles Opera found accusations that he had engaged in “inappropriate conduct” with women “to be credible” but did not find evidence that he had engaged in “a quid pro quo or retaliated against any woman by not casting or otherwise hiring her at LA Opera.” When he left, the company pledged to strengthen its measures for preventing misconduct.
It is difficult to say precisely whether attendance was affected by the departure of Domingo, given that the coronavirus shutdown followed so soon afterward. For many years his performances had drawn the biggest crowds, and his image was as integral to the company’s marketing as Gustavo Dudamel’s is for its neighbor, the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
“It is unmistakably a loss because he’s such a titanic figure in the world,” Koelsch said. But “a scientific controlled experiment is impossible here.”
The opera never filled the general director position after Domingo left; those responsibilities were picked up by Koelsch, who already was running its day-to-day operations.
Domingo, in an email interview, said that in his view, the company has continued to thrive even after what he made clear was his unhappy departure from a position that had been a high point of his career.
“I saw it grow and I believe that I gave it my all, to the point that it became one of the leading opera houses in the U.S. and the world,” he said, adding: “I see the programming and the seasons appear to be very diverse, with a big focus on new works that can attract new audiences and I think this is a great added value for all the people of Los Angeles.”
—
With a $44 million operating budget, the Los Angeles Opera is the fifth largest company in the United States. Despite its (by opera standards) short existence, and with its modest roster of six productions a season (compared with 23 this season at the Met), it has been establishing itself as one of the more adventurous mainstream opera houses in the country, working to be more edgy than stuffy.
Even before Domingo left, the company — aware of his age, and that an institution should not be too closely tied to any one person — had been planning for its future, working to forge an identity that would combine warhorses with more contemporary work.
For a decade it has been working with Beth Morrison Projects, which has been at the vanguard of producing contemporary opera: They collaborated on the world premiere of Ellen Reid’s opera “p r i s m” in 2018 at LA’s smaller Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theater, or REDCAT, and the work won a Pulitzer Prize. And in 2020, “Eurydice,” by Matthew Aucoin, who was then the opera’s artist-in-residence, had its world premiere at the Dorothy Chandler before moving to the Metropolitan Opera.
“LA Opera is doing very, very well,” said Marc A. Scorca, president of Opera America, a nonprofit service organization for opera companies. “Of all the major companies in the country, it is the youngest and is still discovering new audiences and new momentum as LA continues to build out its cultural infrastructure. I am very optimistic about the company.”
This spring, it collaborated with Beth Morrison Projects to present two operas by Irish composer Emma O’Halloran at the 250-seat black box theater inside REDCAT.
One of them, a 70-minute, two-person work called “Trade,” explores an emotionally unsettling hotel room liaison in working-class Dublin between an older married man and a younger male prostitute, hardly the kind of story that has historically been presented on the opera stage.
“When we started this relationship, most opera companies were not doing new work,” Morrison said. “LA Opera, in terms of the big companies, was very much ahead of the curve on that. They believe in experimental work, and they believe we need to have these things to make sure that opera evolves into the future and brings in new audiences.”
Now other large companies, including the Met, are programming more new works in hopes of attracting new audiences.
—
If this is a recovery, it is still a tentative one; crucial questions about how audience behavior has changed remain to be answered. James Conlon, who has been the opera’s music director since 2006, after being recruited for the job by Domingo, said the opera is “working very hard to regain that audience.”
“My own suspicion,” he said, “is that a lot of the competition is not going to be other venues but people who are sitting home who became used to making more use of their televisions.”
That is a particular issue in Los Angeles, considering the early evening traffic that can make trips downtown to the Music Center an exhausting, hourslong adventure.
When the company was first formed, there was much talk about whether LA had an appetite for grand opera.
“Up until the early ’80s the received opinion by many of the leading figures at the Music Center was that ‘LA is not an opera town’ and ‘LA can afford a great symphony or a great opera, but not both,’” said Don Franzen, an original member of the opera’s board of directors.
But 38 years after that opening night, that question appears to have been answered.
“Los Angeles is very much an opera town. I see the growth of the company and its success as a testimony to that,” Scorca, of Opera America, said.
Now Thomas, the company’s current artist-in-residence, is getting ready to take his place singing the demanding role that launched the company: Otello. He recalled that invitation from Domingo, who had floated the idea of appearing with him in the lower-lying baritone role of Iago, since he had stopped singing high tenor roles.
“He was very interested in my singing Otello, and he and I performing the show together,” Thomas said the other day. “I would have loved that to happen. I would have loved to be onstage with one of the legendary singers in opera. Things happen the way they do.”

Writers Find Their Villain: It's Netflix.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Fear of protests prompted the streaming giant to shift an anticipated presentation for advertisers to a virtual event and a top executive to skip an honorary gala.
Just over a week after thousands of television and movie writers took to picket lines, Netflix is feeling the heat.
Late Wednesday night, Netflix abruptly said it was canceling a major Manhattan showcase that it was staging for advertisers next week. Instead of an in-person event held at the fabled Paris Theater, which the streaming company leases, Netflix said the presentation would now be virtual.
Hours earlier, Ted Sarandos, Netflix's co-chief executive, said he would not attend the PEN America Literary Gala at the Museum of Natural History on May 18, a marquee event for the literary world. He was scheduled to be honored alongside the "Saturday Night Live" eminence Lorne Michaels. In a statement, Mr. Sarandos explained that he withdrew because the potential demonstrations could overshadow the event.
"Given the threat to disrupt this wonderful evening, I thought it was best to pull out so as not to distract from the important work that PEN America does for writers and journalists, as well as the celebration of my friend and personal hero Lorne Michaels," he said. "I hope the evening is a great success."
Netflix's one-two punch in cancellations underscored just how much the streaming giant has emerged as an avatar for the writers' complaints. The writers, who are represented by affiliated branches of the Writers Guild of America, have said that the streaming era has eroded their working conditions and stagnated their wages despite the explosion of television production in recent years, for much of which Netflix has been responsible.
The W.G.A. had been negotiating with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of all the major Hollywood studios, including Netflix, before talks broke down last week. The writers went on strike on May 2. Negotiations have not resumed, and Hollywood is bracing for a prolonged work stoppage.
Last week, at a summit in Los Angeles a day after the strike was called, one attendee asked union leaders which studio has been the worst to writers. Ellen Stutzman, the chief negotiator of the W.G.A., and David Goodman, a chair of the writers' negotiating committee, answered in unison: "Netflix." The crowd of 1,800 writers laughed and then applauded, according to a person present at that evening who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the strike.
The last time the writers went on strike, in 2007, Netflix was little more than a DVD-by-mail company with a nascent streaming service. But over the past decade, Netflix has produced hundreds of original programs, helping to usher in the streaming era and upending the entertainment industry in the process.
Initially, Netflix was cheered by the creative community for creating so many shows, and providing so many opportunities.
Demonstrations over the past week have underscored just how much writers have soured on the company. In Los Angeles, Netflix's Sunset Boulevard headquarters have become a focal point for striking writers. The band Imagine Dragons staged an impromptu concert before hundreds of demonstrators on Tuesday. One writer pleaded on social media this week that more picketers were needed outside the Universal lot, lamenting that "everyone wants to have a party at Netflix" instead.
On Wednesday, demonstrators were out in force outside the headquarters. "Ted Sarandos is my dad and I hate him," read one sign. Another said: "I shared my Netflix password. It's 'PAY ME'!"
While the writers marched, the veteran television writer Peter Hume affixed fliers to picket signs that read "Cancel Until Contract" and "Please Cancel Netflix Until a Fair Deal Is Reached."
Mr. Hume, who has worked on shows like "Charmed" and "Flash Gordon: A Modern Space Opera," said the streaming giant was responsible for dismantling a system that had trained writers to grow their careers into sustainable, fulfilling jobs.
"I have 26 years of continuous service, and I haven't worked in the last four because I'm too expensive," Mr. Hume said. "And that's mostly because Netflix broke the model. I think they put all the money into production in the streaming wars, and they took it away from writers."
Netflix's decision to cancel its in-person showcase for marketers next week caught much of the entertainment and advertising industry off guard.
The company had been scheduled to join the lineup of so-called upfronts, a decades-old tradition where media companies stage extravagant events for advertisers in mid-May to drum up interest -- and advertising revenue -- for their forthcoming schedule of programming.
Netflix, which introduced a lower-priced subscription offering with commercials late last year, was scheduled to hold its very first upfront on Wednesday in Midtown Manhattan. Marketers were eager to hear Netflix's pitch after a decade of operating solely as a premium commercial-free streaming service.
"The level of excitement from clients is huge because this is the great white whale," Kelly Metz, the managing director of advanced TV at Omnicom Media Group, a media buying company, said in an interview earlier this week. "They've been free of ads for so long, they've been the reach you could never buy, right? So it's very exciting for them to have Netflix join in."
So it came as a surprise when advertisers planning to attend the presentation received a note from Netflix late Wednesday night, saying that the event would be virtual.
"We look forward to sharing our progress on ads and upcoming slate with you," the note said. "We'll share a link and more details next week."
The prospect of hundreds of demonstrators outside the event apparently proved too much to bear.
Other companies staging upfronts in Manhattan -- including NBCUniversal (Radio City Music Hall), Disney (The Javits Center), Fox (The Manhattan Center), YouTube (David Geffen Hall at Lincoln Center) and Warner Bros. Discovery (Madison Square Garden) -- said on Thursday that their events would proceed as normal, even though writers were planning multiple demonstrations next week.
Mr. Sarandos's decision to pull out of the PEN America Literary Gala will not disrupt that event either. Mr. Michaels, the "Saturday Night Live" executive producer, will still be honored, and Colin Jost, who co-hosts Weekend Update on "Saturday Night Live," is still scheduled to M.C.
"We admire Ted Sarandos's singular work translating literature to artful presentation onscreen, and his stalwart defense of free expression and satire," PEN America said in a statement. "As a writers organization, we have been following recent events closely and understand his decision."
The writers' picket lines have successfully disrupted the productions of some shows, including the Showtime series "Billions" and the Apple TV+ drama "Severance." On Sunday, the MTV Movie & TV Awards turned into a pretaped affair after the W.G.A. announced it was going to picket that event. The W.G.A. also said on Thursday it would picket the commencement address that David Zaslav, the chief executive of Warner Bros. Discovery, is scheduled to give on the campus of Boston University on May 21.
One of the writers' complaints is how their residual pay, a type of royalty, has been disrupted by streaming. Years ago, writers for network television shows could get residual payments every time a show was licensed, whether for syndication, broadcast overseas or a DVD sale.
But streaming services like Netflix, which traditionally does not license its programs, have cut off those distribution arms. Instead, the services provide a fixed residual, which writers say has effectively lowered their pay. The A.M.P.T.P., which bargains on behalf of the studios, said last week that it had already offered increased residual payments as part of the negotiations.
"According to the W.G.A.'s data, residuals reached an all-time high in 2022 -- with almost 45 percent coming from streaming, of which the lion's share comes from Netflix," a Netflix spokeswoman said.
"Irrespective of the success of a show, Netflix pays residuals as our titles stay on our service," the spokeswoman said, adding that the practice was unlike what network and cable television did.
Outside Netflix's Los Angeles headquarters on Wednesday, writers on picket lines expressed dismay that the company was beginning to make money off advertising.
"If they make money doing ads, my guess would be that ads will become a bigger revenue stream for them," said Christina Strain, a writer on Netflix's sci-fi spectacle "Shadow and Bone." "And then we're just working for network television without getting network pay."

Full text: Recent international series of note include "A Spy Among Friends" on MGM+ and "Sam: A Saxon" on Hulu.
It has been a quiet season for international television on American screens -- nothing has grabbed attention on a "Squid Game" or "Downton Abbey" scale. But barely a day goes by, in the streaming age, without an interesting series washing up from some foreign shore. Here are four recent shows worth tracking down, from an elegant British thriller to a Chinese dramedy about a demon god and an immortal warrior who meet cute on the mortal plane.
'A Spy Among Friends'
Alexander Cary, a writer and executive producer on "Homeland," wrote this six-episode spy thriller as a leisurely, literate, three- or four-dimensional game of chess. Based on the nonfiction book of the same name by Ben Macintyre, it tells the story of Kim Philby (and the other high-level Soviet spies known as the Cambridge Five) by focusing on a set of intertwined sparring matches: Philby's with his friend and MI6 colleague Nicholas Elliott, sent to Beirut to bring the disgraced Philby home; Elliott's with a (fictional) agent, Lily Thomas, assigned to interrogate him when he returns to London alone; and Elliott and Thomas's with the MI6 hierarchy once he brings her around to his side.
Made for the British streaming service ITVX and available here on MGM+ and Prime Video, "A Spy Among Friends" is smart, complicated (at times overly so) and saturated in a particular Cold War blend of tragic romanticism and kitchen-sink class politics. What makes it stand out, though, is its casting. Anna Maxwell Martin and Guy Pearce are excellent as Thomas and Philby, and Damian Lewis is outstanding as Elliott, the colorless spy's spy whose skills and motives are in question until the end. Tightly controlled yet somehow relaxed, Lewis gives a performance in which the coldblooded manipulator and the sentimentally loyal bro coexist at every moment.
'Sam: A Saxon'
As triumph-of-the-spirit stories go, "Sam: A Saxon" is notably low on triumph. Sam Meffire, the subject of this German biographical mini-series from Hulu, grew up in Dresden, both acutely aware of how his skin color set him apart and fiercely loyal to his East German homeland; shortly before the Berlin Wall fell, he became the country's first policeman of African descent. His life since then -- he's only 52 -- has been a carnival ride that no screenwriter would be likely to dream up: first a poster boy in a national ad campaign designed to humanize the police, and then a fugitive fleeing to Africa to avoid arrest for armed robbery.
Jörg Winger, a creator and the showrunner of "Sam," was also a creator of "Deutschland 83" and its sequels, and the shows share a knack for embedding engaging characters in real-world events in a way that feels both credible and suspenseful. In this dramatized telling, Meffire, played by the imposing actor Malick Bauer, is a true believer who finds himself continually and perversely acted upon by history. He is tossed about by the fall of Communism, and by the ravages of capitalism, racist nationalism and crime that the collapse unleashes. "Sam: A Saxon" stands firm against streaming-video bloat: Its seven episodes barely contain the story it sets out to tell.
'Skip and Loafer'
This sweet, lightly sentimental slice-of-life anime, halfway through its 12-episode season on Crunchyroll (and available for purchase on Prime Video), is an example of something that Japanese animation provides more consistently than American live-action TV: a comic, even expressionistic depiction of high-school life that still feels unforced and natural. Mitsumi, the star student of her small seaside town, moves to Tokyo to attend an elite prep school. Ferociously single-minded, very impressed with herself and determined to take her new school by storm, she's also a quick-to-embarrass country bumpkin, a classic setup for teenage comedy.
An early scene of Mitsumi's childhood friends chasing after her departing train is a ruse, a poke at the conventions of this sort of story in traditional anime and Studio Ghibli-style films. And the bending of perspectives continues: While Mitsumi runs a gantlet of welcoming ceremonies, classroom presentations and karaoke parties in Tokyo, we and everyone around her -- new friends, old friends and family -- can see the anxieties and mortifications that she thinks she is hiding. The show (whose cryptic title, taken from the manga on which the anime is based, probably alludes to Mitsumi and her slacker crush, Sousuke) is a lighthearted essay on loneliness and the life-or-death nature of every decision a 15-year-old makes.
'Till the End of the Moon'
While a demon god is in the process of destroying the world, the resolute mystical warrior Li Susu (Bai Lu) is sent back in time 500 years to find the demon while he is still in mortal form and kill him. Arriving in the kingdom of Sheng, she discovers that she is in the body of a headstrong, very poorly behaved princess who is married to -- do I have to spell it out?
"Till the End of the Moon," which is 35 episodes into its 40-episode run on Rakuten Viki, was a major hit in China, where it wrapped up this week; its premiere reportedly drew the highest numbers in three years for a xianxia (immortal heroes) drama. It's an excellent example of the Chinese streaming-video industry's capacity for making slickly disposable, highly enjoyable entertainment that combines elements of costume drama and special-effects-laden fantasy action with a healthy portion of romantic comedy. The humor will largely translate for a Western viewer, and Luo Yunxi ("My Sunshine," "Ashes of Love"), who plays both the annihilating god and the possibly sympathetic human prince, is a hypnotic camera subject.

He Took Sorrow And Made a Song: [Review]

Full text: Mortality and sorrow bring new depth on the superstar British songwriter's sixth studio album, pronounced "Subtract."
"There's beauty when it's bleak," Ed Sheeran reminds himself in "Boat," the opening song on his new album, "-" (pronounced "Subtract"). Mortality loomed around the British musician in 2022, the year he wrote most of the songs on "-," and it's reflected in the music: subdued, primarily acoustic and downtempo, and a long way from the big beats and brash productions of its predecessor, "=" ("Equals") in 2021. Its songs balance between despair and reassurance, barely tilting toward optimism. "If we make it through this year then nothing can break us," he vows in "No Strings."
In a Disney+ documentary series, "Ed Sheeran: The Sum of It All," which was released just before the new LP, Sheeran says the album reveals his "deepest, darkest thoughts." He has been openly diaristic before: airing career grudges in "Eraser," exploring his family lore in "Nancy Mulligan," greeting a new child in "Welcome to the World." But his latest songs cope with pain, depression and mourning, and they struggle to find happy endings.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In "End of Youth," he sings, "Can't get a handle on my grief/When every memory turns to tears," and in "Borderline," he admits, "Sadness always finds an in/Sneaks its way past infecting everything." Previewing the album with a 2022 concert at Union Chapel in London that's shown in the documentary, Sheeran found himself crying onstage.
In "Toughest," a bonus track, Sheeran sings, "The doctor said it's cancer and a baby's on the way." That's reportage: Sheeran's wife, Cherry Seaborn, was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor in her arm while pregnant with their second child, Jupiter. (She got treatment after the child was born.) In February 2022, Sheeran's close friend Jamal Edwards died at 31; he was a YouTube tastemaker, producer, entrepreneur and D.J. who gave Sheeran pivotal early recognition.
In 2022 and into this year, Sheeran also faced multiple lawsuits over accusations of plagiarism, since he tends to use chord progressions and structures that give his songs pop's instant familiarity. At times, he has added songwriting credits as resemblances emerged, as he did in "Photograph" (citing "Amazing," a hit by Matt Cardle, whose collaborators Martin Harrington and Thomas Leonard sued in 2016) and "Shape of You" (which echoed TLC's "No Scrubs.") "I am just a guy with a guitar who loves writing music for people to enjoy," he said after prevailing in a case involving Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On" last week. "I am not and will never allow myself to be a piggy bank for anyone to shake."
Still, Sheeran also spent much of 2022 and 2023 as a touring superstar, headlining stadiums worldwide with his voice, guitars, keyboard and loop machine, getting tens of thousands of people singing along. Over the last decade, he has proved himself to be a consummate, driven 21st-century musician: gifted, career-minded and supremely adaptable yet easily recognizable, writing songs that revel in direct language and big feelings.
Sheeran has made himself the USB port of pop songwriting, connecting with virtually everything. He can reach back to the tunefulness of his Irish forebears, croon in an R&B falsetto, wax folky and introspective, pump up a rock anthem, deliver a perky pop chorus or flaunt the syncopated flow of a rapper. He has written or collaborated on folk-pop, hip-hop, grime, K-pop, R&B, Afrobeats, Latin pop, movie themes, reggaeton, electronic dance music and more -- too prolific to be contained.
According to the documentary, Sheeran had a decade-plus master plan. His new album completes a five-album arc of arithmetic symbols, with "-" following "+" (2011), "x" (2014), "÷" (2017) and "=" (2021). Per its title, "-" was intended to be a stripped-down singer-songwriter album, though Sheeran has by no means renounced big pop choruses.
"-" was produced by Aaron Dessner, the keyboardist and guitarist from the National and a co-producer of Taylor Swift's "Folklore" and "Evermore." Sheeran built most of the songs on instrumental tracks by Dessner: sparse piano or guitar chords leading to stately choruses, often burnished with somber string arrangements.
They're sturdy songs, even as Sheeran sings about fragile emotions. In the hymnlike "Salt Water," he contemplates drowning and possibly suicide, with a choir rising behind him to share the line "Embrace the deep and leave everything"; then he shrugs it off, singing, "It was just a dream." In "Life Goes On," over a fitfully strummed guitar reminiscent of Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'," he begs, "Tell me how/How my life goes on with you gone?" and then wills himself forward: "Easy come, hard go/Then life goes on."
Obviously, Sheeran doesn't worry about verbal clichés -- though in these songs, the sorrowful tone makes them sound more unguarded than banal.
The album does have a stealth pop tune: "Eyes Closed," which Sheeran started in 2018 with the hitmaker Max Martin and rewrote as a song to mourn Edwards: "Every song reminds me you're gone." Acoustic instruments -- cello, guitar -- carry the staccato arrangement, but the chorus still works up a hefty beat and an "eye-yi-yi-eyes" vocal hook. Even in his deepest, darkest moments, Sheeran invites a pop singalong.

Full text: Wall Street held steady on Monday ahead of a week full of reports on some of the market's biggest worries, including the stubbornly high inflation afflicting the economy.
The S&P 500 edged up by 1.87, or less than 0.1 percent, to 4,138.12 coming off its worst week in nearly two months. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 55.69 points, or 0.2 percent, to 33,618.69, while the Nasdaq composite added 21.50, or 0.2 percent, to 12,256.92.
Besides a strong reading on U.S. jobs, which calmed worries about the potential for a recession but raised concerns about high inflation, last week was dominated by fears about smaller and midsize banks.
PacWest Bancorp rose 3.6 percent to recover some of last week's 43 percent plunge. It said on Friday night that it was cutting its dividend to help it build financial strength. Several other smaller and midsize banks also rose, including a 0.6 percent increase for Western Alliance Bancorp.
They have been under heavy pressure as Wall Street hunts for the next weak link after three U.S. bank failures since March. Weighed down by much higher interest rates, smaller and midsize banks are scrambling to assure Wall Street that their deposits are secure and not under threat of a sudden exodus, similar to the runs that toppled Silicon Valley Bank and others.
The larger concern for markets is that all the turmoil could cause banks to pull back on lending. That in turn could raise the risk of a recession, which many investors already see as highly likely.
A report from the Federal Reserve on Monday showed that many banks tightened their lending standards during the first three months of the year. The survey also suggested that many banks expected to raise their standards over the course of 2023. Some smaller and midsize banks said they wanted to take less risk and were worried about deposit outflows.
Weighing down on Wall Street on Monday were stocks of companies that turned in worse results for the latest quarter than expected.
Tyson Foods tumbled 16.4 percent after it reported a loss, instead of the profit that analysts had forecast. Its revenue also fell short of expectations.
So far this earnings reporting season, the trend has been to beat analysts' forecasts. Apple was last week's highlight, and its better-than-expected report helped the market immensely because its stock is Wall Street's largest and carries the most weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes.
Six Flags Entertainment jumped 18.6 percent after it reported a smaller loss than analysts had expected. It also said attendance was improving.
Expectations were broadly quite low, though, given high interest rates and a slowing economy. Like Apple, companies across the S&P 500 are on track to report a drop in profit for the latest quarter versus a year earlier.
In an encouraging signal, more companies than usual have been offering forecasts for upcoming results above Wall Street's expectations. The ratio of such pre-announcements is at its strongest level in two years, the equity strategist Savita Subramanian said in a BofA Global Research report, and analysts expect earnings growth to resume in the third quarter of this year.
That has helped to steady stocks despite all the worries about much higher interest rates. The S&P 500 has been more or less churning in place since early April. It has not had a weekly gain or loss of at least 1 percent since March, the longest stretch in nearly two years, said Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing, at E-Trade.
Later this week, the U.S. government will give the latest monthly updates on inflation at the consumer and wholesale levels. Earnings reports will also arrive from Duke Energy, the Walt Disney Company and News Corp.

‘It’s Going to Be a While’: No End in Sight for Hollywood Strike

It’s not just posturing: As screenwriters continue their strike against Hollywood companies, the two sides remain a galaxy apart, portending a potentially long and destructive standoff.
“Any hope that this would be fast has faded,” said Tara Kole, a founding partner of JSSK, an entertainment law firm that counts Emma Stone, Adam McKay and Halle Berry as clients. “I hate to say it, but it’s going to be a while.”
The Writers Guild of America, which represents 11,500 screenwriters, went on strike Tuesday after contract negotiations with studios, streaming services and networks failed. By the end of the week, as companies punched back at the union in the news media, and striking writers celebrated the disruption of shows filming from finished scripts, Doug Creutz, an analyst at TD Cowen, told clients that a “protracted affair seems likely.” He defined protracted as more than three months — perhaps long enough to affect the Emmy Awards, scheduled for Sept. 18, and delay the fall TV season.
The WGA has vowed to stay on strike for as long as it takes. “The week has shown, I think, just how committed and fervent writers’ feelings are about all of this,” Chris Keyser, a chair of the WGA negotiating committee, said in an interview Friday. “They’re going to stay out until something changes because they can’t afford not to.”
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of studios, streaming services and networks, has maintained that it hopes “to reach a deal that is mutually beneficial to writers and the health and longevity of the industry.” Privately, however, member companies say they are prepared to weather a strike of at least 100 days. The most recent writers strike, which began in 2007 and ended in 2008, lasted that long.
“It’s fair to say there’s a pretty big gap,” Bob Bakish, CEO of Paramount Global, told analysts and investors on a conference call Thursday. Paramount and its CBS subsidiary are prepared to “manage through this strike,” he added, “even if it’s for an extended duration.”
Both sides have insisted that the other needs to make the first move to restart talks. None are scheduled. For the moment, media companies have turned to contract renewal negotiations with the Directors Guild of America, which start Wednesday. That contract expires June 30.
Like writers, directors want more money, especially regarding residual payments (a type of royalty) from streaming services, which have rapidly expanded overseas. Before streaming, writers and directors (and other creative contributors, including actors) could receive residual payments whenever a show was licensed, whether that was for syndication, an international deal or DVD sales. In the streaming era, as global services including Netflix and Amazon have been reluctant to license their series, those distribution arms have been cut off.
In addition to raises, however, writers want media companies — Netflix, in particular — to make structural changes to the way they do business. The companies — Netflix, in particular — say that is a bridge too far.
The WGA has proposals for mandatory staffing and employment guarantees, for instance. The union contends that the proposals are necessary because entertainment companies are increasingly relying on what is known in Hollywood slang as a miniroom. In one example of a miniroom, studios hire a small group of writers to develop a series and write several scripts over two or three months. Because they have not officially ordered the series, studios pay writers less than if they were in a large, traditional writers’ room.
And given the relatively short duration of the positions, those writers are then left scrambling to find another job if the show is not picked up. If a show does get a green light, fewer writers are sometimes hired because blueprints and several scripts have been created.
“While the WGA has argued” that mandatory staffing and duration of employment “is necessary to preserve the writers’ room, it is in reality a hiring quota that is incompatible with the creative nature of our industry,” the studio alliance said in a statement Thursday.
Writers responded with indignation. “We don’t need the companies protecting us from our own creativity,” said Keyser, whose writing credits include “Party of Five” and “The Last Tycoon.” “What we need is protection from them essentially eliminating the job of the writer.”
Writers also want companies to agree to guarantee that artificial intelligence will not encroach on writers’ credits and compensation. Such guarantees are a nonstarter, the studio alliance has said, instead suggesting an annual meeting on advances in the technology. “AI raises hard, important creative and legal questions for everyone,” the studios said Thursday. “It’s something that requires a lot more discussion, which we have committed to doing.”
Keyser’s response: Go pound sand.
“This is exactly what they offered us with the internet in 2007 — let’s chat about it every year, until it progresses so far that there’s nothing we can do about it,” he said.
In that case, have fun on the picket lines, studio executives have said privately: It’s going to be hot out there in July.
Over the past week, media companies conveyed an air of business as usual. On Thursday, HBO hosted a red carpet premiere for a documentary, while the Fox broadcast network announced a survivalist reality show called “Stars on Mars” hosted by William Shatner.
“3 … 2 … 1 … LIFT OFF!” the network’s promotional materials read.
With the exception of late-night shows, which immediately went dark, Bakish assured Wall Street, “consumers really won’t notice anything for a while.” Networks and streaming services have a large amount of banked content. Reality shows, news programs and some scripted series made by overseas companies are unaffected by the strike. Most movies scheduled for release this year are well past the writing stage.
Shares climbed Friday for every company involved with the failed contract talks; investors tend to like it when costs go down, which is what happens when production slows, as during a strike. If the strike drags into July, analysts pointed out, studios can exit pricey deals with writers under “force majeure” clauses of contracts.
“The sorry news for writers is that, in declaring a strike, they may in fact be helping the streaming giants and their parent companies,” Luke Landis, a media and internet analyst at SBV MoffettNathanson, wrote in a report Wednesday.
Writers, however, succeeded in making things difficult for studios over the first week. Apple TV+ was forced to postpone the premiere of “Still,” about Michael J. Fox and his struggle with Parkinson’s disease, because Fox refused to cross a picket line. In Los Angeles, writers picketed the Apple TV+ set for “Loot,” starring Maya Rudolph, causing taping to halt. In New York, similar actions disrupted production for shows such as “Billions,” the Showtime drama. Other affected shows included “Stranger Things” on Netflix, “Hacks” on HBO Max and the MTV Movie & TV Awards telecast Sunday, which was scheduled to go forward without a host after Drew Barrymore pulled out, citing the strike.
“The corporations have gotten too greedy,” Sasha Stewart, a writer for the Netflix documentary series, “Amend: The Fight for America” as well as “The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore,” said from a picket line last week. “They want to break us. We have to show them we will not be broken.”
Writers went into the strike energized. But a rally at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on Wednesday seemed to supercharge the group, in part because leaders from other entertainment unions turned out to support them — and in fiery fashion. During the 2007 strike, writers were largely left to stand alone, while a union representing camera operators, set electricians, makeup artists and other crafts workers blasted the writers for causing “devastation.”
Ellen Stutzman, chief negotiator for the writers, received a standing ovation from the estimated 1,800 people who attended the rally. During the session, writers suggested expanding picket lines to the homes of studio CEOs and starting a public campaign to get people to cancel their streaming subscriptions.
Some writers realized that Teamsters locals, which represent the many drivers whom studios rely on to transport materials (and people), would not cross picket lines. So they started to picket before dawn to intercept them. (The WGA has advised a 9 a.m. starting time.) At least one show, the Apple TV+ dystopian workplace drama “Severance,” was forced to shut down production Friday as a result of Teamsters drivers’ refusing to cross.

Full text: 'Side Effects' (May 16)
The director Steven Soderbergh is always a little bit ahead of the curve, and back in 2013, years before the current vogue of nostalgia for the erotic thrillers of the '80s and '90s, he assembled this steamy story of sexual deception and double-crosses. He is reunited with several of his previous stars, including Jude Law, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Channing Tatum, who are joined by Rooney Mara in a femme fatale turn that is alternately sensuous and scary.
'The Last Days' (May 18)
The film, which won the Academy Award for best documentary feature of 1998, tells the story of a lesser-known chapter of the Holocaust: how German troops invaded Hungary in March 1944, long after it was clear the Nazis were going to lose World War II, and deported hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews to concentration camps in Poland, where most were murdered. This chronicle of pure evil is told as a story of survival and perseverance, focusing on five survivors and the inspirational ways they spent their lives.
'Galaxy Quest' (May 31)
This witty comedy is, first and foremost, a winking satire of not only "Star Trek" but the fan-catering "geek" culture. It is also a swashbuckling comic adventure, borrowing the "Three Amigos" model of fictional characters mistaken for real heroes. Sigourney Weaver has a blast, Tim Allen invokes the bloated ego of his Shatner-esque star with ease, and Alan Rickman steals the show as the classically trained thespian saddled with the Spock role.
'Rango' (May 31)
The Disney juggernaut (and, to a lesser extent, the invasion by the animation studio Illumination) has become so pervasive in family entertainment that it's easy to miss kid-friendly entertainment that appears without that imprimatur. But this 2011 animated adventure from Nickelodeon Movies and Paramount Pictures is a delight, offering as much entertainment for parents as for kids. Gore Verbinski directs his "Pirates of the Caribbean" leading man, Johnny Depp, in the title role of a lost chameleon who becomes sheriff of a small animal town in the desert. JASON BAILEY

Is the G.O.P. Doomed to Repeat 2016?: [Op-Ed]

Author: Douthat, Ross

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Around the time that Donald Trump announced his presidential campaign, there was a lot of chatter about how anti-Trump Republicans were poised to repeat the failures of 2016, by declining to take on Trump directly and letting him walk unscathed to the nomination.
This take seemed wrong in two ways. First, unlike in 2016, anti-Trump Republicans had a singular, popular alternative in Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, whose polling was competitive with Trump's and way ahead of any other rival. Second, unlike in 2016, most Republican primary voters have now supported Trump in two national elections, making them poor targets for sweeping broadsides against his unfitness for the presidency.
Combine those two realities, and the anti-Trump path seemed clear enough: Unite behind DeSantis early, run on Trump fatigue, and hope for the slow fade rather than the dramatic knockout.
But I will admit, watching DeSantis sag in the primary polls -- and watching the Republican and media reaction to that sag -- has triggered flashbacks to the 2016 race. Seven years later, it's clear that many of the underlying dynamics that made Trump the nominee are still in play.
Let's count off a few of them. First, there's the limits of ideological box-checking in a campaign against Trump. This is my colleague Nate Cohn's main point in his assessment of DeSantis's recent struggles, and it's a good one: DeSantis has spent the year to date accumulating legislative victories that match up with official right-wing orthodoxy, but we already saw in Ted Cruz's 2016 campaign the limits of ideological correctness. There are Republican primary voters who cast ballots with a matrix of conservative positions in their heads, but not enough to overcome the appeal of the Trump persona, and a campaign against him won't prosper if its main selling point is just True Conservatism 2.0.
Second, there's the mismatch between cultural conservatism and the anti-Trump donor class. Part of DeSantis's advantage now, compared with Cruz's situation in 2016, is that he has seemed more congenial to the party's bigger-money donors. But many of those donors don't really like the culture war; they'll go along with a generic anti-wokeness, but they hate the Disney battles and they're usually pro-choice. So socially conservative moves that DeSantis can't refuse, like signing Florida's six-week abortion ban, yield instant stories about how his potential donors are thinking about closing up their checkbooks, with a palpable undercurrent of: "Why can't we have Nikki Haley or even Glenn Youngkin instead?"
This leads to the third dynamic that could repeat itself: The G.O.P coordination problem, a.k.a. the South Carolina pileup. Remember how smoothly all of Joe Biden's rivals suddenly exited the presidential race when it was time to stop Bernie Sanders? Remember how nothing remotely like that happened among Republicans in 2016? Well, if you have an anti-Trump donor base dissatisfied with DeSantis and willing to sustain long-shot rivals, and if two of those rivals, Haley and Senator Tim Scott, hail from the early primary state of South Carolina, it's easy enough to see how they talk themselves into hanging around long enough to hand Trump exactly the sort of narrow wins that eventually gave him unstoppable momentum in 2016.
But then again, a certain cast of mind has declared Trump to have unstoppable momentum already. This reflects another tendency that helped elect him the first time, the weird fatalism of professional Republicans. In 2016 many of them passed from "he can't win" to "he can't be stopped" with barely a way station in between. A rough month for DeSantis has already surfaced the same spirit -- as in a piece by Politico's Jonathan Martin, which quoted one strategist saying resignedly, "We're just going to have to go into the basement, ride out the tornado and come back up when it's over to rebuild the neighborhood."
Influencing this perspective, again as in 2016, is the assumption that Trump can't win the general election, so if the G.O.P. just lets him lose it will finally be rid of him. Of course that assumption was completely wrong before, it could be wrong again; and even if it's not, how do you know he won't be back in 2028?
Then, the final returning dynamic: The media still wants Trump. This is not offered as an excuse for G.O.P. primary voters choosing him; if the former president is renominated in spite of all his sins, it's ultimately on them and them alone.
But I still feel a certain vibe, in the eager coverage of DeSantis's sag, suggesting that at some half-conscious level the mainstream press really wants the Trump return. They want to enjoy the Trump Show's ratings, they want the G.O.P. defined by Trumpism while they define themselves as democracy's defenders.
And so Trump's rivals will have to struggle, not only against the wattage of the man himself, but also against an impulse already apparent -- to call the race for Trump before a single vote is cast.

Full text: Roger Lee has cataloged hundreds of thousands of tech job cuts on his site Layoffs.fyi. He still believes the industry will "100 percent" bounce back.
A short list of moments in the day when Roger Lee is thinking about layoffs: while waiting for someone to show up to a Zoom call. After his two young children have gone to sleep. At 5 a.m., before his first meeting of the day.
Since starting Layoffs.fyi as a side project at the start of the pandemic, he has cataloged nearly 450,000 tech layoffs in a public spreadsheet, updating the list whenever he can find a few minutes.
Though Mr. Lee, 36, reads bad news constantly, he remains a stalwart optimist about tech. He recognizes the pain that layoffs cause, but he also believes the industry will "100 percent" bounce back.
And Mr. Lee believes that talking openly about layoffs in the industry he loves is healthy. "The reduced stigma has the potential to be really positive," he said. If people are speaking openly about layoffs, he reasons, workers can find new jobs efficiently.
Layoffs.fyi is both a symptom and a cause of a cultural shift toward transparency about layoffs in tech. Though Mr. Lee would never claim that his site is the only force driving this trend, he does think that it has helped workers put their own layoffs in context -- and has helped the public understand the downturn. After tech companies fought to scoop up top talent during the pandemic, rapidly rising interest rates pushed companies to start making drastic cuts this year and last.
"Having this website engenders more transparency," said Nick Bloom, a professor of economics at Stanford. As so many tech workers are laid off in Silicon Valley, he added, "the stigma has almost totally evaporated."
Over the past three years, Mr. Lee's site has become a meaningful resource. Recruiters scour the listings for talent after big layoffs, and workers post their information when they lose their jobs.
Tim Sackett, who runs an I.T. and engineering staffing firm, said that looking at Layoffs.fyi saves him "a tremendous amount of time," because it points him to workers who are actively looking for jobs.
Media organizations, including The New York Times, often cite Layoffs.fyi as a source for the latest tech layoff figures. While the Bureau of Labor Statistics shares data on layoffs in various sectors, it does not track them at venture-capital-backed start-ups and tech companies in real-time. So Mr. Lee helps fill the gap.
"If you have fantastic government data on the state of tech," Mr. Bloom said, you don't need a site like Mr. Lee's. "But if that data does not exist, Layoffs.fyi becomes invaluable."
"There was just a complete data vacuum," at the start of the pandemic, he added. "It's impressive he was so early."
Mr. Lee didn't mean for any of this to happen. "It does feel weird," he said, "to be the bearer of bad news." But he has kept going. He said his site gets at least a million views per month -- and more than that in busy periods with a lot of layoffs.
Mr. Lee had been following layoffs in an informal way since 2015, as he looked for talent to hire at his previous start-up. When the pandemic hit, he was on parental leave. He thought maybe others would find his process useful. "My original motivation was to be helpful," he said. At the time, he added, he was struck by the volume of layoffs occurring. "I thought, wow, seven in one week, that's so many."
Soon, the layoffs -- and the demands of updating the tracker -- accelerated. By April 2020, he said, "I was spending all of my baby's nap times updating the site."
Mr. Lee follows an informal set of self-imposed rules about what companies to post about, and when. He makes a judgment call about whether a company counts as "tech"-- Buzzfeed: yes; Disney: no;-- and sometimes sits on information until it has been reported in the news media.
"I don't want to be a place where employees find out," Mr. Lee said. "I get these 'scoops' but don't try to break news."
"I don't pretend these are hard and fast rules," he added. But, so far, he says they allow him to provide information that is useful to people without accidentally causing panic.
Mr. Lee runs Layoffs.fyi as a hobby, and he spends money on it. In addition to his time, he estimates that he spends about $ 200 each month on the cost of its servers. He said he has declined to run ads, though he has been approached.
But the site's popularity did help give him the idea for a new company: Comprehensive.io, which tracks compensation in tech job postings, on a public list.
He considers Comprehensive.io to be the inverse of Layoffs.fyi -- it focuses on opportunities, not cuts. "I likely wouldn't have come up with the latter without the former," he said.
"Part of what gave him the intuition that people would find the pay transparency data interesting is how interesting people found the layoffs data," said Teddy Sherrill, Mr. Lee's longtime friend and a founder of Comprehensive.io, which now has a staff of about a dozen people.
Though Mr. Lee is not yet 40, he takes a long view of tech. It helps that he has spent about half his life building websites.
When advertisers first reached out to Mr. Lee asking if they could run ads on a site he built as an adolescent, he told them he didn't want to talk on the phone.
"I feared if I talked to them, they would realize I was a 13-year-old," he said.
By 2002, Mr. Lee and his childhood friend ran some of the most popular sites for teens, according to Nielsen data published at the time.
One of the companies he co-founded was SubProfile, a social media service built on AOL's instant messenger platform. By his junior year of high school, he said the site was generating "six figures in revenue" and getting at least seven million unique visitors per month. (Nothing he has done since has exceeded that traffic, he said.)
He received his first paycheck from an advertiser at his parents' home in the suburbs of New York.
"It was definitely a surreal experience," Mr. Lee said of his time as a teen entrepreneur. "That's when I first fell in love with the internet."
Mr. Lee sold another company, a study guide site, while he was an undergraduate at Harvard.
After graduation, he co-founded an internet ad sales start-up called PaperG in New Haven, Conn. Mr. Lee was at the company, which has since changed its name to Thunder and was sold to Walmart, for about seven years.
Krystal Benitez was hired onto Mr. Lee's operations team at PaperG in 2012. By that point the company, and Mr. Lee, had moved to San Francisco. Ms. Benitez said that Mr. Lee often gave informal financial advice to the staff, including several lunchtime lectures about investing and retirement planning. Personal finance is "a very near and dear topic to his heart," she said. Indeed, Mr. Lee soon founded a 401(k) start-up called Human Interest, which was valued at a billion dollars in 2021.
"There's maybe no better way to have impact on people's financial lives than through employment and how they're paid," Mr. Lee said. He added that his interest in personal finance has animated his career, from Human Interest to Layoffs.fyi to his work now on Comprehensive.io.
Mr. Lee's early enchantment -- and early success -- with the web continues to power his optimism about the industry, and his view that lives can be improved through technology.
"The economy has gone through two boom-and-bust cycles that I've been a part of," he said. "Both times, tech came back stronger than ever."
"I know it has its downsides," he said of the internet. But, he added, "The upsides are so, so positive." He believes that human traits, including our best impulses, are magnified online.
"You might think the person behind Layoffs.fyi would be a cynical character," said Tyler Bosmeny, a college classmate of Mr. Lee's who was the first employee at PaperG and has since invested in his companies. But, he said, Mr. Lee is "the most optimistic person I know." He added that Mr. Lee often sees thorny issues as data problems that can be solved with tech.
"What's most hysterical," Mr. Bosmeny added, is that "this was his idea of taking a break."

Getting the Intergalactic Band Back Together: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This dour, visually off-putting two-and-a-half-hour A.S.P.C.A. nightmare of a film may only be for completionist fans.
Animal lovers, comic book fans and unofficial adjudicators of narrative continuity, action and style in the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Lend me your ears. "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3" is not the movie for you.
Perhaps this dour, visually off-putting two-and-a-half-hour A.S.P.C.A. nightmare of a film is only for completionist fans like myself, arriving at the theater armed with overpriced popcorn and the hope that the director James Gunn's latest could replicate the romp and anti-gravity gambol of the first.
For those who need help getting their multiversal timeline untangled, "Guardians" is the second film of the so far ecstatically bad Phase Five of the M.C.U., after the, to quote my colleague, "thoroughly uninspired" "Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania." We last caught our whole team of lovable riffraff together in "Avengers: Infinity War," when Thanos (Josh Brolin) threw his adopted daughter and galaxy guardian, Gamora (Zoe Saldaña), into an abyss to get one of the Infinity Stones, which he used to snap away half of the universe. (There were some dancing Groots and a cute holiday special about abducting Kevin Bacon, but -- sorry, Kev -- they were irrelevant.)
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Now the Guardians are settling in at Knowhere, a community in the severed head of a celestial that serves as their home base. With Gamora gone, Peter (Chris Pratt), a.k.a. Star-Lord, is still grieving, unaware of the fact that somehow Gamora -- or, rather, a variant -- is alive, sans her memories of him and the Guardians. When, a few minutes into the film, Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) becomes victim to a deadly attack, the team is reunited with a hostile, partially amnesiac Gamora, who is reluctantly dragged into their plot to save him.
While Rocket is in critical condition, Peter and company do some risky snooping through Rocket's traumatic back story to figure out how to save his life and stop the man pursuing him, the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). A powerful god-figure, the High Evolutionary has genetically altered Rocket, other animals and even children to create a perfect race to inhabit his imagined utopia. (Yes, that's another Nazi-coded villain for your Bingo card.)
So much of "Guardians 3" seems to erupt from left field, most prominently the main story, which is driven by Rocket, even though the Guardians have mostly played second-string to Star-Lord, the plot-driving hero. The shift makes sense given the role this film plays as the end of the trilogy, resulting in a Guardians team with a different starting lineup and an unclear position in the context of the rest of the M.C.U. But the shift also feels belabored and emotionally manipulative; scenes upon scenes of shot, blown up, tortured and incinerated C.G.I. animals with big, emotive eyes are as merciless as clips of injured animals set to a Sarah McLachlan song.
It seems "Guardians" needs this much gratuitous trauma bait to establish its stakes and prove that the bad guy is, in fact, bad. Which is unfortunate because Iwuji, who offered a much more nuanced performance in Gunn's edgy-fun DC Extended Universe series, "Peacemaker," is left with just a thin silhouette of an antagonist to work with here. (Will Poulter and Maria Bakalova also appear as idiotic secondary antagonists, for no real reason.)
Something like Thanos Lite or a knockoff Dr. Frankenstein, the High Evolutionary represents one of the central problems the franchise is facing in a post-"Endgame" M.C.U.: characters and circumstances that pale in comparison to Thanos and his cataclysmic, conclusive multi-arc-spanning plotline. Because at least the extent of Thanos's power and the roots of his villain philosophy were clear. "There is no god -- that's why I stepped in," the High Evolutionary says at one point. This tiny germ of a motivation does nothing but indicate all the questions that the film could have answered about this character to make him more interesting. Surely an atheist with a narcissistic personality and obsessive-compulsive disorder has some deeper psychology to unpack. Ah well.
Though this "Guardians" is certainly less fun than the others, there are still glints of joy in the more mundane and ancillary quibbles among the found family of misfits. Dave Bautista gives another priceless performance as Drax, and Bautista's signature chemistry works with Pom Klementieff as Mantis. Groot (Vin Diesel) has leveled up in the bang-bang-shoot-em-up category, as has Nebula (Karen Gillan). Though the film makes no attempt to explain the logic behind Gamora's magical reappearance ("I'm not some infinity stone scientist!" Peter exclaims after trying to puzzle things out), it does at least give Saldaña the opportunity to reinvent her character, which she manages beautifully. The same for Rocket, who gives an Oscar-worthy performance -- via Cooper's great voice acting, of course, but also via the animation, which makes his faces, postures and movements look so unbelievably believable.
Gunn makes the curious, bold choice to chase an unpleasant aesthetic that's part Cronenberg, part "Osmosis Jones." A series of scenes take place in a ship fashioned like viscera and innards, with fleshy globules and architectural dendrites, often in nude tones. Squishy sound effects add an unwelcome layer of grossness.
Even when the movie switches back to the more lambent palette of nebulae and the luminous shine of the stars, Gunn's direction doesn't serve the full tableau. His camera is too voyeuristic, spinning enthusiastically on every axis during group fight scenes rather than giving us a steady look at the choreography.
At least this "Guardians," like the previous ones, stays on beat with a fantastic soundtrack of Spacehog, Beastie Boys and Earth Wind & Fire. But pumping soundtrack aside, after a breakout hit and the sequel, "Everything Would Have Been Fine if Your Dad the Space God Played Catch With You: The Movie," this final piece of the trilogy makes one thing apparent: "Guardians" was just a one-hit wonder.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3
Rated PG-13 for some swearing and a zoo of horrors. Running time: 2 hour 30 minutes. In theaters.

'Super Mario Bros. Movie' Reaches $1 Billion at the Box Office: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The animated film's grosses helped make April the first month to surpass its prepandemic average at the box office.
The animated film "The Super Mario Bros. Movie" crossed the $ 1 billion box-office threshold on Sunday, making it the fifth movie to do so since the start of the pandemic and the surest sign yet that the theatrical movie business is on the rebound after a prolonged downturn.
Despite middling reviews, the Universal Pictures film, which features Chris Pratt as the voice of the beloved video game character Mario, has been in theaters for only 26 days and is now the seventh biggest film in Universal's history, passing both "Jurassic World Dominion" and the animated "Despicable Me" in worldwide box office grosses.
Of the five films to cross the $ 1 billion mark since the pandemic began, "Super Mario" is the first animated one. Geared to families with young children -- and fans of the uber-popular Nintendo video game -- the movie provided a welcome reprieve to theater owners who had been concerned that the family film business was at risk of not returning to prepandemic levels. In fact, "Super Mario" helped push the April domestic box office up 11.5 percent compared with prepandemic levels, according to the box office analyst David A. Gross.
Mr. Gross called the stat "a breakthrough" since it marks the first month that has surpassed its prepandemic average. The 2023 year-to-date box office deficit is now down 21.8 percent compared with that average.
But not everything is coming up roses at the multiplex. The well-reviewed adaptation of Judy Blume's beloved children's novel "Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret" pulled in only $ 6.8 million during its opening weekend. The PG-13 rated film, which cost $ 30 million to make and focuses on the challenges of prepubescent adolescence, was primarily viewed by Lionsgate, the studio behind the film, as a nostalgia play, and it worked in attracting women over 45 who were fans of the 50-year-old novel from their childhood. The company was less successful luring in an audience of teenage girls, but there is hope among box office analysts that strong word-of-mouth will bring in more moviegoers as Mother's Day weekend draws near.
Studios and their theater partners are optimistic about the summer season, which officially begins next weekend, when Disney will debut the third and final film in the "Guardians of the Galaxy" trilogy, directed by James Gunn. The 10th "Fast and Furious" movie will follow, and both movies are expected to be huge hits for May. Also buoying optimism is the array of family films headed to theaters this summer, including the live action adaptation of "Little Mermaid," coming at the end of May, along with Sony Pictures's "Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse" and Pixar's "Elemental," both headed to theaters in June.

Full text: A new series about the woman who hid Anne Frank and her family premieres on National Geographic, and E! streams "the party of the year."
Between network, cable and streaming, the modern television landscape is a vast one. Here are some of the shows, specials and movies coming to TV this week, May 1-7. Details and times are subject to change.
Monday
E! LIVE FROM THE RED CARPET: MET GALA 2023 6 p.m. on E!

This year's themed exhibition is "Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty," a homage to the longtime luxury brand designer who helped shape the modern fashion world. (Mr. Lagerfield died in 2019). Michaela Coel, Penélope Cruz, Roger Federer, Dua Lipa are the event's co-chairs this year.
A SMALL LIGHT 9 p.m. on LIFETIME, NGC and NAT GEO WILD. This limited series tells the story of Miep Gies (Bel Powley), a Dutch woman who was the secretary to Otto Frank (Liev Schreiber), the father of Anne Frank (Billie Boullet), during World War II. Premiering with two back-to-back episodes, the series follows Gies and her husband whose lives changed when they agreed to help hide the Frank family -- and four other individuals -- over the course of two years.
Tuesday
LIFE BELOW ZERO: FIRST ALASKANS 8 p.m. on NGC. This unscripted series, a spinoff of the Emmy Award-winning series "Life Below Zero," follows Indigenous Alaskans as they survive and thrive in one of the most remote landscapes on Earth.

Wednesday
NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (2007) 10:17 p.m. on MAX. Joel and Ethan Coen "combine virtuosic dexterity with mischievous high spirits" in their film adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel of the same name, writes A.O. Scott in his review for The New York Times. This neo-western thriller, which won the Oscar for best picture, follows three men entangled in a drug deal gone awry in 1980 West Texas. Javier Bardem plays Anton Chigurh, a "deadpan sociopath with a funny haircut." Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is a jaded sheriff, trailing the detritus Chigurh leaves behind. Both are following Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), "the human center of the film, the guy you root for." Scott promises you will be "jangled, stunned," and "completely and ecstatically absorbed."
Thursday
GUNGA DIN (1939) 3:30 p.m. on TCM. "All movies should be like the first twenty-five and the last thirty minutes of 'Gunga Din,"' wrote Benjamin Crisler in his review for The Times. This classic adventure film, which pulls elements from Rudyard Kipling's 1890 poem by the same name, follows three British sergeants in colonial India (Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) who fight a murderous cult, with the titular Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe) as their guide. The film was deemed culturally significant by the Library of Congress in 1999 and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.
Friday

FREE CHOL SOO LEE 8 p.m. on PBS. For Asian American and Pacific Islander heritage month, PBS's Emmy Award-winning anthology series, "Independent Lens," presents a documentary about Chol Soo Lee, a Korean immigrant who was wrongfully convicted of murder in 1973. Though he is ultimately exonerated, this "isn't an uplifting movie," wrote Ben Kenigsberg in his review for The Times, as the documentary follows Lee on his troubled post-prison journey. "Just because Lee was innocent doesn't mean he was perfect," Kenigsberg writes.
Sunday
MTV MOVIE & TV AWARDS 8 p.m. on MTV. The actress Drew Barrymore will host this year's awards show, where a number of film and television stars will be recognized for their work -- among them Jennifer Coolidge ("The White Lotus"), the 2023 winner of the Comedic Genius Award, which will be presented to her at the event.

Full text: What's Up? (April 23-29)
Pink Slips for Cable News Stars
In a matter of hours on Monday, cable news underwent a seismic shift. First, Fox News announced that it had ousted Tucker Carlson, its most popular prime-time host. The move came less than a week after the company paid $ 787.5 million to settle a defamation suit with Dominion Voting Systems. A focus of the case had been Mr. Carlson's texts, showing him denigrating Donald J. Trump after the 2020 presidential election. But it wasn't until the day before the defamation trial was to begin that Fox leadership discovered private messages sent by Mr. Carlson that had been redacted in previous legal filings showing him making highly offensive and crude remarks. Those messages served as a catalyst for his firing, several people with knowledge of Fox's discussions said. Soon after Mr. Carlson was fired, CNN announced that it had "parted ways" with Don Lemon, a longtime star on the network who most recently was a morning show co-host. Mr. Lemon met backlash in February when he made comments about women and aging that many considered sexist.
Troubled Banks
Federal regulators were racing over the weekend to seize and sell the troubled First Republic Bank before financial markets open on Monday. First Republic, a midsize bank in San Francisco, reported a staggering deposit flight over last month. Last Monday, the bank's executives said it had a quarterly loss of $ 102 billion in customer deposits, more than half of the $ 176 billion it held at the end of last year, not taking into account the $ 30 billion lifeline it received in March from the country's biggest banks. First Republic's troubles are part of a wider banking crisis that began with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in mid-March. In a report released on Friday on the failure of SVB, the Federal Reserve blamed itself for failing to prevent SVB's collapse. Michael S. Barr, the Fed's vice chair for supervision, said overseers at the central bank had failed to "take forceful enough action" and said regulatory standards for SVB "were too low."
Slowing Economic Growth
The U.S. economy was still growing in the first three months of the year, according to preliminary data released on Thursday, as consumers continued to spend on goods and services like travel and dining out. Gross domestic product in the United States rose at a 1.1 percent annual rate, a deceleration from the 2.6 percent rate in the last three months of 2022 but still the third straight quarter of growth. The robust consumer spending helped offset slowdowns elsewhere: The housing sector and business investment in equipment -- two areas of the economy sensitive to changes in interest rates -- both continued to shrink. But how long will consumers continue to open their wallets? Analysts are not sure.
What's Next? (April 30-May 6)
A Highly Anticipated Fed Meeting
These days, aren't all meetings of the Federal Reserve highly anticipated? Well, yes. But even in the era of closely observed Fed moves, the meeting this Wednesday is notable. With signs of an economic slowdown, some analysts now believe there is a slim possibility that Fed officials will pause their streak of interest rate increases. At their last meeting in March -- squarely in the midst of the banking turmoil -- officials raised rates by a quarter-point, matching the previous month's increase. But the Fed signaled that much uncertainty lay ahead as it sought a narrowing path to a soft landing, made narrower by the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Still, many analysts expect the central bank to approve another quarter-point increase, continuing its fight to tame cooling but persistent inflation.
Hollywood's Labor Dispute
Thousands of screenwriters in Hollywood could go on strike as soon as Tuesday, when their contract with the industry's major studios expires. Earlier this month, the writers' unions, which are affiliated with the East and West Coast branches of the Writers Guild of America, said that 98 percent, or more than 9,000, of the writers they represent approved a strike authorization, empowering union leaders to call for a labor stoppage. Writers say their wages and working conditions have worsened amid the streaming boom for scripted television. Hollywood studios have said that demands for a new pay structure ignore economic realities. As the possibility of a strike has crept nearer, executives have been stockpiling scripts and preparing reality series, which don't need script writers. But late-night shows like "Saturday Night Live" will go dark immediately if writers walk off the job.
Job Market May Be Cooling
The consensus forecast for this Friday's jobs report is that employers added 170,000 jobs in March, down from 236,000 in February. That would be the first time the number of new jobs added in a month dropped below 200,000 since the early days of the pandemic, and it would also put the labor market within spitting distance of the Fed's target of about 100,000 jobs added per month. The labor market has been remarkably resilient in the face of the central bank's recent policy moves. But analysts say that could soon change: They expect to see a significant slowdown later this year, which could mean more layoffs of the sort that have so far been largely contained to the tech and media industries.
What Else?
Bed Bath & Beyond said last Sunday that it was filing for bankruptcy and would begin closing hundreds of locations while it sought to sell parts of its business. Disney filed a First Amendment lawsuit on Wednesday accusing Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida and other state officials of "a targeted campaign of government retaliation." And the latest in the FTX saga: On Thursday, the F.B.I. searched the home of Ryan Salame, a former executive at the defunct cryptocurrency exchange.

New Lyft C.E.O. Lays Out Vision and Tells Workers to Return to the Office: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A day after nearly 1,100 people were laid off, the struggling company told its remaining workers to prepare for a series of changes.
Since the pandemic began, Lyft employees have been able to work remotely, logging into videoconferences from their homes and dispersing across the country like many other tech workers. Last year, the company made that policy official, telling staff that work would be "fully flexible" and subleasing floors of its offices in San Francisco and elsewhere.
No longer. On Friday, David Risher, the company's new chief executive, told employees in an all-hands meeting that they would be required to come back into the office at least three days a week, starting this fall. It was one of the first major changes he has made at the struggling ride-hailing company since starting this month, and it came just a day after he laid off 26 percent of Lyft's work force.
"Things just move faster when you're face to face," Mr. Risher said in an interview. Remote work in the tech industry, he said, had come at a cost, leading to isolation and eroding culture. "There's a real feeling of satisfaction that comes from working together at a whiteboard on a problem."
The decision, combined with the layoffs and other changes, signals the beginning of a new chapter at Lyft. It could also be an indication that some tech companies -- particularly firms that are struggling -- may be changing their minds on flexibility about where employees work. Nudges toward working in the office could soon turn into demands, as they have at companies like Disney and Apple.
Bob Sutton, an organizational psychologist and a professor at Stanford, said that although in-person collaboration could help with creativity and some other parts of work, companies pushing for a return to office might be doing so to have greater oversight of their workers.
"When top executives feel financial stress, the classic 'threat-rigidity' effect kicks in, and beyond possible benefits for communication, collaboration and creativity, they feel compelled to increase their own illusion of control," Mr. Sutton said.
After lagging behind its rival, Uber, in the race to emerge from the pandemic doldrums, Lyft posted worrisome financial results in February. Its founders, Logan Green and John Zimmer, said the next month that they would step down.
Mr. Risher, a veteran of Microsoft and Amazon who also served on Lyft's board of directors, has laid out a plan to streamline the business, cut costs and focus on improving the quality and lowering the price of Lyft's core product: rides for customers.
Lyft employees have complained that divisions outside the ride-hailing business, like units that offer rental cars to its gig drivers and rent bikes and scooters to consumers, seemed to be disproportionately affected by the layoffs. Mr. Risher said the cuts were across the board.
He said the cost savings from the layoffs would go toward lower prices for riders and higher earnings for drivers.
The next phase of his plan, he said, is to remind riders that Lyft is a viable alternative to Uber. In the summer, Mr. Risher said, he will gradually introduce products to increase interest in the platform. That may include teaming up with companies to offer Lyft rides to their employees who are commuting to offices, he said.
The next steps for the company will be difficult. Many Lyft employees have gotten used to working from home, and some were already bristling at the possibility of returning to the office. Lyft continues to trail Uber, which has a global ride-hailing business and also offers food delivery.
Lyft's stock price is trading at $ 10 a share, down from $ 78 at its peak, and some have speculated that it could be an acquisition target. The company will report financial results for its most recent quarter next week and expects $ 975 million in revenue, lower than the $ 1.1 billion investors had hoped for earlier this year. It is not yet profitable.
Mr. Risher announced a handful of other changes on Thursday. He ended products focused on car rentals, as well as shared rides and luxury rides, and he promoted Kristin Sverchek, the head of business affairs, to president.
Lyft also planned to tell employees that it would reduce their stock grants this year, according to a person familiar with the decision.
The return to office plan, Mr. Risher said, would require workers to come in Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, with Tuesdays recommended, beginning after Labor Day. People will be allowed to work remotely for one month each year, and those living far from offices would not be required to come in.
Mr. Risher said he saw the moment as an opportunity to have a "cultural reset, particularly around decision-making."
He said that Lyft was successful with its early ride-hailing business, but that Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer's idea to build a transportation network, with products focused on scooters, bikes, parking and rental cars, "didn't really resonate with people." The company has pared back those offerings but does still have bikes and scooters.
"So now, my focus is saying, 'Gosh, in ride share alone, there's an enormous amount of innovation left.' People desperately want to get out and live their lives, and we can help them," Mr. Risher said. "And then maybe, over time, we can build some things back on top of that."

Pence Can't Hide From Trump's Legal Woes: [National Desk]

Full text: The former vice president faces many challenges in his potential presidential run, perhaps none bigger than his complicated relationship with his old boss.
Former Vice President Mike Pence, seemingly in his element as he addressed a gathering of evangelical Christians in Iowa this month, was speaking of "the greatest honor of my life," serving in "an administration that turned this country around" by rebuilding the military, securing the southern border, and unleashing "American energy."
"But most importantly, most of all," he said, building to a crescendo -- but at the moment he was about to claim some credit for his administration's success in overturning the right to an abortion, a booming voice came over the loudspeaker from the sound booth: "Check, check, testing, 1-2-3."
It was a small interruption, but one that exemplified the diversions Mr. Pence continues to face as he considers a run for the Republican presidential nomination against the man who was once his greatest benefactor, but also his cruelest tormentor: Donald J. Trump.
On Thursday, however, Mr. Pence faced a much more onerous and grueling intrusion into his potential campaign, and one that he had hoped to avoid, when he was forced to testify for more than five hours before a grand jury in Washington about Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Those efforts put Mr. Pence's life at risk on Jan. 6, 2021, as a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, chanting "Hang Mike Pence."
Mr. Pence, the would-be candidate with unassailable religious convictions who spent four years a heartbeat away from the presidency, cannot seem to find the space to present those credentials to sympathetic Republican primary voters without interruption -- and, in this case, on the biggest stage before a campaign has even begun.
After Thursday's testimony, a highly unusual event involving two of the most prominent U.S. public officials during a nascent presidential campaign in which both are likely to run, he is in the odd and uncomfortable position of being both a potential challenger to his former boss and possibly a key witness for his prosecution.
Mr. Pence knows that core voters in the Republican base are in no mood to give such legal proceedings against Mr. Trump, including the current civil suit accusing him of rape and defamation, much credence. Paula Livingston, of Council Bluffs, Iowa, waved off the cases pending against Mr. Trump as "all the same, they're out to stop him."
Nor is Mr. Trump showing any signs of contrition. On Thursday, while campaigning in New Hampshire, the former president embraced a supporter who had served prison time for her actions during the Capitol attack of Jan. 6, and called her "terrific," even though she said she wants Mr. Pence executed for treason.
But after the former vice president's efforts to quash the Justice Department's subpoena for his testimony failed, Mr. Pence had little choice but to lend his voice to the federal prosecution.
The Pence camp is now working to put that testimony within the broader rubric of his potential presidential run: Conservative truth teller. Pence loyalists would like Mr. Pence to be getting more credit for the Trump administration's successes, especially for helping to choose the nominees that tilted the Supreme Court to the right.
But Mr. Pence has to play the hand that he has been dealt, and right now that includes testifying against Mr. Trump.
"I don't know if he has to dislodge" Mr. Trump, Marc Short, a former chief of staff to the vice president, said. "He has to remind voters who he is."
Over his 12 years in Congress, as governor of Indiana and in the Trump White House, Mr. Pence was "the consistent conservative," Mr. Short said, working for a man who was anything but consistent: "That's an important contrast for him to draw," Mr. Short said.
A Republican close to the former vice president, who requested anonymity in order to discuss internal deliberations, explained on Friday that Mr. Pence has long stuck with conservative constitutional principles, even when that has meant standing up to his party.
As a House member, he chastised the administration of President George W. Bush for its failure to adhere to fiscal discipline as federal budget surpluses turned to large deficits. He has embraced changes to Social Security and Medicare that would trim benefits in the name of balancing the budget, changes that Mr. Trump has loudly rejected.
He continues to publicly make the case for U.S. military aid to Ukraine, even as some Republican lawmakers and many Republican voters turn against it. He has said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis's fight with the Walt Disney Company over social policy has strayed, and become a violation of the Republican Party's bedrock belief in free enterprise.
And he leaned on constitutional arguments, first to avoid the subpoena of federal prosecutors investigating efforts to overturn the 2020 election, and now to comply with it. Earlier this year Mr. Pence argued that the Constitution's "speech or debate" clause, intended to protect the separation of powers between the three branches of government, shielded him from having to speak of Mr. Trump's campaign to pressure him not to certify the election results in his ceremonial role as vice president.
When that failed, he complied with the subpoena rather than search for another rationale for delay, such as the "executive privilege" claims that have been repeatedly rejected.
Mr. Pence, in his recent book "So Help Me God," described in detail Mr. Trump's efforts to pressure him into blocking congressional certification of President Biden's victory. Mr. Trump became preoccupied with the idea that Mr. Pence could do something, though Mr. Pence's chief lawyer had concluded that there was no legal authority for him to act on Mr. Trump's behalf.
But people close to Mr. Pence said that just as he argued that he had to fulfill his constitutional duty on Jan. 6, 2021, he invoked that same Constitution the following day to reject overtures from Democratic leaders to use the Constitution's 25th amendment to remove Mr. Trump from office.
Aides to Mr. Pence showed little worry this week as the former vice president continues his deliberations about a run. Mr. Pence's attitude, they said, is simple: Let the chips fall where they may.
"He feels remarkably blessed to have been able to serve the American people in the roles he has had," Mr. Short said, "and he hopes to continue that service."

After Stumbles at Home, DeSantis Heads Abroad to Find His Footing: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Florida governor is finishing a whirlwind trip from Asia to Israel to London, asserting a muscular foreign policy voice, especially in Jerusalem, as the spotlight on him grows brighter.
Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida gave social media a goofy grimace, suggested that Ukraine and Russia seek a cease-fire and praised the policies of former President Donald J. Trump, the man he would need to beat for the Republican presidential nomination, even as he attacked President Biden's foreign policy.
Mr. DeSantis's whirlwind trip abroad this week was meant to elevate his credentials as a statesman and heavyweight, while taking him away from the hurly-burly of a fledgling presidential campaign that he has not officially begun.
But if Mr. DeSantis thought it would give him a reprieve from scrutiny, he was mistaken. His trip, which has taken him to Tokyo, Seoul, Jerusalem and, finally, London, with events there on Friday, has been free of any overt gaffes or obvious embarrassments. But his words have been parsed and compared with those of rivals and previous presidential hopefuls. His facial expressions have been examined. Even the placement of his hands has not escaped the notice of the international news media.
"There are people who will always be critical, but I don't worry about that," said Kenneth T. Cuccinelli, a former Trump administration official who now leads Mr. DeSantis's super PAC. "He's showing himself to be a guy who can go toe-to-toe around the world."
Mr. DeSantis's foreign trip, ostensibly a trade mission with some loftier moments intentionally mixed in, no doubt has come at an awkward political moment. Senior Republicans have continued to move toward Mr. Trump, and the head of the Senate Republicans' campaign arm, Senator Steve Daines of Montana, recently endorsed him. Mr. DeSantis's position in Republican primary polls has slipped. Key donors have expressed serious misgivings about the governor's chances, and the largest employer and taxpayer in his state, Walt Disney, has sued him.
Mr. DeSantis needs coverage from conservative media if he hopes to cut into Mr. Trump's lead, but it has largely ignored his travels. Newsmax did, however, give prominent billing to Mr. Trump's mockery of his rival's "emergency Round the World tour," which Mr. Trump said was to "see if he can remove the stain from his failing campaign."
But Mr. DeSantis also got much of what he wanted, including meetings with the prime ministers of Japan, South Korea and Israel; news conferences with an international backdrop; and, on Thursday, an address at a Jerusalem conference for Israel's 75th anniversary.
In a sense, Mr. DeSantis's trip is a nod to traditional presidential campaigning, before Mr. Trump threw that script in the trash in 2016. In 2008 after they had their presidential nominations sewn up, Senator John McCain and his Democratic rival, Senator Barack Obama, both visited Israel. At the time tongues wagged over Mr. Obama's decision to tour the occupied West Bank and Mr. McCain's decision not to.
"It was certainly designed to demonstrate his readiness to grapple with many of the challenges he would face," said Dan Shapiro, who put together and managed Mr. Obama's trip and ultimately became his ambassador to Israel, "particularly for a candidate who had not been on the international stage for a long time and was running against a decades-long foreign policy voice in John McCain."
Mitt Romney, unsuccessfully seeking the Republican nomination, visited Israel in 2007, touring the Holocaust museum Yad Vashem. He returned in 2012, raising the ire of Palestinian leaders by suggesting that cultural differences explained why the Israelis were so much more economically successful than the Arabs under occupation.
"It's a box that everyone checks," said Francis Rooney, a former Republican congressman from Florida who was close with Mr. DeSantis when they served together in the House. "It's a chance for him to show the world, particularly the U.S. electorate, that he has some things to say on foreign policy."
For Mr. DeSantis, a pugilistic governor known mainly for domestic fights with corporations, educators and Democrats over social policy, the trip has been a chance to discuss foreign policy, though not without some controversy. In Japan, he criticized Germany for not doing enough to bolster Ukraine's self-defense, while raising the prospects of a bloody stalemate in Ukraine with echoes of the Battle of Verdun during World War I.
"You don't want to end up in, like, a Verdun situation, where you just have mass casualties, mass expense, and end up with a stalemate," he told a Japanese newspaper. "It's in everybody's interest to try to get to a place where we can have a cease-fire."
He praised the U.S.-Japan alliance to which Mr. Trump was at times hostile, and took some voter-pleasing jabs at China.
But the statecraft choreography was left mainly to Thursday's leg in Israel, which came at a fraught moment. Israel's new government, the most right-wing in its history, has drawn tens of thousands of protesters to the streets and alienated many American Jews. Mike Caruso, a Republican Florida state representative, said in an interview from Jerusalem that he rushed a bill through the Legislature in Tallahassee this week to increase criminal penalties for antisemitic and other bias crimes so the governor could sign it ceremonially in Jerusalem.
"They love him in Israel, I can tell you that," Mr. Caruso said. "I've never seen a more inviting crowd. When he walked into the room, it just lit up."
And at a news conference where Mr. DeSantis favored conservative outlets from the United States and Israel, he took a swipe at the Biden administration, criticizing the deterioration under Mr. Biden in relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia, and suggesting that Washington should avoid taking sides in Israel's domestic debate about the future of its judiciary. Mr. Biden has taken an increasingly vocal stance against efforts by the far-right Israeli government to assert greater control over the country's Supreme Court.
"We must also in America respect Israel's right to make its own decisions about its own governance," Mr. DeSantis said. "You're a smart country, you figure it out; it shouldn't be for us to butt into these important issues."
He also flagged his efforts as governor in targeting Airbnb, after the travel listings company briefly removed from its website properties in the Israeli-occupied West Bank a few years ago. Mr. DeSantis also repeated his long-held position on the West Bank, which the governor says is "disputed" territory and which he referred to as "Judea and Samaria," the biblical name for the territory used by right-wing Israelis.
His stance is at odds with that held by most countries, which consider the West Bank occupied territory because it was captured by Israel from Jordan during the Arab-Israeli War of 1967.
But in embracing the Israeli far right and its positions on domestic and Middle Eastern affairs, Mr. DeSantis was obliquely praising the policies of the Trump administration. While never mentioning Mr. Trump by name, Mr. DeSantis tried to differentiate himself from his rival by noting that he had pushed the administration to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, months before Mr. Trump decided to do so.
Mr. DeSantis also hailed the deals between Israel and the Persian Gulf states brokered by Mr. Trump, known as the Abraham Accords, and said that he supported efforts to secure a new one between Israel and Saudi Arabia.
"It would be petty of the governor to not acknowledge that accomplishment," Mr. Cuccinelli said, "and he is not petty."
The governor's performance in Israel could shore up his standing with conservative evangelical Christians, the most stalwart supporters of the Israeli right, as well as with wavering Republican donors. Miriam Adelson, a Republican megadonor who was part of the proceedings on Thursday in Jerusalem, has been a strong supporter of Mr. Trump, but since the death of her husband, the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, she has pulled back her giving to Republican candidates.
But in a world where nothing dies on the internet, said David Jolly, a former Republican House member from Florida who left his party in disgust during the Trump era, the most lasting image of Mr. DeSantis's trip might be the goofy face he made in Tokyo when asked about polls showing him well behind Mr. Trump. His answer -- "I'm not a candidate, so we'll see, if and when that changes" -- will be forgotten but his odd expression might not be.
"When confronted on the world stage, you saw him physically react and flail," Mr. Jolly said. "Those memes are going to live on for a long time."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The elimination of check marks that helped authenticate accounts has convulsed a platform that once seemed indispensable for following breaking news.
In the 24 hours after Twitter last week eliminated the blue check mark that historically served as a means of identifying public agencies, at least 11 new accounts began impersonating the Los Angeles Police Department.
More than 20 purported to be various agencies of the federal government. Someone pretending to be the mayor of New York City promised to create a Department of Traffic and Parking Enforcement and slash police funding by 70 percent.
Mr. Musk's decision to stop giving check marks to people and groups verified to be who they said were, and instead offering them to anyone who paid for one, is the latest tumult at Twitter, the social media giant he has vowed to remake since he acquired it last year for $ 44 billion.
The changes have convulsed a platform that once seemed indispensable for following news as it broke around the world. The information on Twitter is now increasingly unreliable. Accounts that impersonate public officials, government agencies and celebrities have proliferated. So have propaganda and disinformation that threaten to further erode trust in public institutions. The consequences are only beginning to emerge.
Alyssa Kann, a research associate at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, said Twitter under Mr. Musk was systematically dismantling safeguards that had been put in place over years of consideration and controversy.
"When there are so many things going wrong at once, it's like: Which fire do you put out first?" she said.
After a public dispute with NPR, which Twitter falsely labeled state-affiliated media, the platform last week removed all labels that had identified state-owned media, including those controlled by authoritarian states like Russia, China and Iran.
That, coupled with a decision to stop blocking recommendations for them, has coincided with a spike in engagement for many of these accounts, according to research by the Digital Forensic Research Lab and another organization that studies disinformation, Reset, which is based in London.
In Sudan, new accounts on Twitter are falsely representing both sides of the civil war that has erupted there. One account that, presumably, bought a blue check mark falsely proclaimed the death of Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, the leader of the rebel Rapid Support Forces. More than 1.7 million people viewed the tweet.
Twitter's new head of trust and safety, Ella Irwin, did not respond to a request for comment on the changes and their consequences.
Twitter has always been a font of misinformation and worse, but the previous policies sought to inform readers of the sources of content and limit the most egregious instances. The debut of verified accounts at Twitter in 2009 is usually associated with Tony La Russa, a major-league baseball manager who sued Twitter for trademark infringement and other claims after being impersonated on the platform.
Over time, verified accounts with blue check marks steered users to official sources and real people. Labeling news organizations as state media indicated that the accounts reflected a certain point of view.
Impersonators became a problem almost immediately after Mr. Musk took the helm in November and offered to sell the check marks to anyone who subscribed for the monthly fee. He backtracked after companies like Eli Lilly and PepsiCo grappled with seemingly verified spoof accounts promising free insulin and praising the superiority of Coca-Cola.
By last week, Twitter had begun removing the blue check marks from companies, government agencies, news organizations and others who did not agree to pay. It appears that many chose not to sign up, though Twitter has not disclosed any figures.
Some cheered the changes.
"Now you can even find me in the search," tweeted Margarita Simonyan, the editor in chief of RT, the Russian state television network that has been accused of rampant misinformation and hate speech aimed at Ukraine. She signed off the tweet by saying, "Brotherly, Elon @elonmusk, from the heart."
Twitter's algorithms previously excluded accounts labeled state officials or media from recommendations, dampening engagement. According to Reset, 124 accounts belonging to Russian state media have received on average 33 percent more exposure in views and impressions after the changes, which took effect in late March.
They include accounts like that of Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former president of Russia and deputy chairman of the country's security council, who posted a distorted photograph of President Biden on Tuesday, calling him in English "a daring geezer."
When an account argued this month that Twitter was amplifying Russia's genocidal propaganda toward Ukraine, Mr. Musk replied dismissively: "All news is to some degree propaganda. Let people decide for themselves." (The account he was responding to has since been suspended.)
Researchers said the abrupt changes in how the check marks are obtained threatened, at a minimum, to create confusion. They could also undermine trust in a tool for communication during crises like natural disasters.
The main account of the Los Angeles Police Department has a gray check mark, which Twitter created for "legacy accounts," but not all of its various bureaus do -- the Hollywood division, for example. In addition to providing blue check marks for $ 8 a month, Twitter has invited organizations to pay $ 1,000 to receive gold marks for multiple accounts. For a time, at least, one was extended to a Disney Junior impostor account that tweeted racist and vulgar language.
"This is going to be chaos for emergency services," tweeted Marc-André Argentino, a research fellow at the London-based International Center for the Study of Radicalization.
Mr. Argentino tracked examples showing an account impersonating the mayor of Chicago replying to one impersonating the city's Department of Transportation. Another had New York City's actual government-run account arguing with an impostor.
"Yes this is funny, let us all laugh," Mr. Argentino wrote. "Now take two seconds and go back to any mass casualty incident in a major city, or a natural disaster, or any crisis/critical incident when people turn to official sources of information in times need & think of the harm that this can cause."
On Friday, the comedian George Carlin's daughter, Kelly Carlin, tweeted an accusation that someone was masquerading as the account she runs for her late father, even using the same profile photo and claiming to be her.
"HERE IT BEGINS," she wrote, later complaining after several unsuccessful attempts to have the impostor account removed that "Twitter is broken." The spoof account was still up on Wednesday, with nine followers.
Josh Boerman, who co-hosts a pop culture podcast, "The Worst of All Possible Worlds," was the source of the account impersonating Mayor Eric Adams of New York, promising to create a traffic and parking department and cut police funding.
Mr. Boerman said he had tried hard to leave obvious hints that he was an impersonator. His tweet thread included unrealistic scenarios where all police officers' guns were melted down and sold for scrap, with the proceeds going to the parks department. He made up an organization with a ludicrous name: the New York City Porcine Benevolent Association. He promoted his podcast to his relatively small Twitter following of 1,700 users.
"Pretty much everybody got that it was a joke immediately, which was my hope -- I wasn't trying to mislead anyone," Mr. Boerman said. "The point was that this can be both a joke on the state of the network right now as well as an opportunity to think about the way that media is disseminated and how we think about our public figures."
The removal of the blue verification badges caused "immediate and pure chaos," but the novelty eventually wore off, he said. His profile name is now "bosh (not mayor anymore)." He said he was careful to confirm any announcement he saw on Twitter using other sources.
"The problem comes when you have accounts that maybe have hundreds of thousands of followers and are positioning themselves as the real thing," Mr. Boerman said. "Twitter's approach of 'Well, if people pay for verification, certainly they must be legit' is so inane I don't even know how to put words to it."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Netflix, which has been struggling recently, announced last week that on Sept. 29 it will cease its 25-year-old DVD-by-mail delivery business to focus on its streaming service. Whereas most functioning members of 21st-century culture greeted the news with indifference or puzzlement -- "People still use DVDs?" -- the announcement hit me with a jolt of dread and dismay.
In the face of pity from viewers of all ages, I've boasted for years, perhaps with a touch of hyperbole, of being the last paying subscriber of DVD.com, the spinoff division Netflix created in 2011. I was the kind of full-throttle loyalist who actively urged others to switch back to the vestigial anomaly that was DVD.com -- the O.G. Netflix, to those of us who lived and breathed during the previous century. I also refused to upgrade. A colleague once went so far as to set up an HBO Max trial account for me and shove it into my inbox. "You'll be converted," he said with the assurance of someone who understands accepted behavioral norms.
But I had been happy bucking the norm! My devotion to DVD.com is not about Luddite resistance or stubborn nostalgia. It's a choice and it's about better choices. Choice in all senses of the word -- about simultaneously expanding and narrowing my options, about active decisions over passive ones, about human curation as opposed to the algorithm.
Let me explain. Netflix pays for streaming rights to films and programs it does not own the rights to, which means that films come and go on the service according to the terms of those contracts. But DVD.com offered all its movies and TV shows at all times. Last week, for example, I watched two movies not currently available on Netflix: 1979's "The China Syndrome" and 1980's "Altered States," both period paranoia fare and reflective of the sort of niche moods and obsessions that populate my maxed-out 500-disc-long queue. If I want to go deep into Albert Finney, I can line up nearly every film of his, from "Tom Jones" to "The Gathering Storm." I can toggle movies upward if I grow impatient to see something I added three years earlier.
Or I can allow for serendipity -- movies appear in my mailbox that I barely remember adding in the first place. I can play a kind of guessing game around what precipitated a particular whim. Was it Jeanne Moreau's obituary? A retrospective at MoMA? The site's regularly maintained "forthcoming release" page, which I checked religiously? During the service's glory days, you could easily sort movies by country of origin and display them in chronological order. The Criterion Collection was in there, sure, but so was "Alien³." You could add not-yet-available movies to a special "saved" section when you'd missed the theatrical release or before an old film existed on DVD.
The choices were broader but my options were narrower, because on my subscription plan, I would have only four movies available to me at any given time. When I visited homes that subscribed to every streaming service from Amazon Prime to Disney+, I felt paralyzed by the surfeit of possibilities, like Robin Williams floored in the coffee aisle in "Moscow on the Hudson" (available, yes, on DVD.com). As the psychologist Barry Schwartz documented in his seminal book, "The Paradox of Choice," more is, in fact, often less -- having too many options can send us into a tailspin.
I started on Netflix's DVDs 20 years ago, while I was dating the man who became my husband, an early customer of what was then known simply as Netflix. This was well before streaming led the company to spin off DVD.com like a discarded training bra, a source of shame to what had become an entertainment behemoth. He allowed me into his account the way a boyfriend offers a spare dresser drawer. Tentatively at first, I added movies I wanted to watch to his queue. Soon I was working the list, pushing my choices ahead of his. "Did you delete my Buster Keaton?" he'd ask while I pretended to clean out the refrigerator. As happens with any long-married couple, we eventually worked it out in that I essentially took over the account and he moved on to more advanced technologies.
There is a cost to clinging to products and services as they shuffle off into obsolescence. Like a mom-and-pop video store with a desperate "Everything must go!" sign in its window, the service starts to decline as employees are laid off. On DVD.com, the "coming soon" feature disappeared a few years ago and the responses to my forlorn emails to customer service essentially said, "Yeah, sorry." Like a half-empty shelf in aisle 4, the new "user interface" eliminated the drop-down menu of foreign movies by language; the once assiduously updated "new releases" became a vague "new and popular."
When the portable DVD player that I perched on the elliptical machine in my basement petered out after 12 workhorse years last winter, I excitedly ordered a new one. "Surely it will be better than the old jalopy!" I told myself. But companies have few incentives to upgrade dying technology. My replacement DVD player offered fewer amenities than its predecessor. It mutters out movie dialogue reluctantly, barely exceeding the swooshing sounds of the elliptical treads.
Here I must make a confession: I am not, in fact, impervious to the lure of streaming. My secret affair started during lockdown with an Apple TV+ account I rationalized as "part of the computer." I soon added a press account or two for streaming services because I "needed them for work." When I watch films or series on these services I tell myself it is purely part of covering the culture and not actively participating in it. The truth is, I have started enjoying these services. Delete this paragraph after reading.
So yes, I have been slightly cheating on DVD.com. But I'm still not ready for the relationship to end. My alternative partners look as unappealing as photo-less profiles on an astrology-based dating app: I do not want to watch movies on an iPad, where all kinds of notifications may interrupt. Streaming movies don't include fun DVD extras like deleted scenes, director commentaries and original trailers. Surely, I would never actually buy DVDs for movies I want to watch just once. I pity anyone who has missed out on the pleasures of DVD.com, just as I pity the kids who never knew the joys of Le Video or the original Kim's Video or even an especially well-stocked Blockbuster. You still have five months left.

Outcry Over Inclusive Beer Ad Points to Peril for Big Business: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Bud Light's marketing effort with a transgender influencer has put it "in the center of the culture wars in a way that no company could possibly want to be," one observer said.
When she was named Anheuser-Busch's marketing vice president, Alissa Heinerscheid explained in a recent podcast interview, "I had this super clear mandate: We need to evolve and elevate this incredibly iconic brand." Doing that, she said, "means having a campaign that's truly inclusive."
But the limits of that mandate, and of how Anheuser-Busch defined "inclusive," became apparent in recent days, when the company announced that Ms. Heinerscheid and her boss, Daniel Blake, were on a leave of absence after a wave of right-wing outrage over a Bud Light marketing campaign that involved the transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.
The backlash and subsequent scrambling provide a lesson in the newly unsettled politics of corporate America. In the past decade, major companies have leaned into liberal social politics that are increasingly anathema to their longstanding allies in the Republican Party and the consumers who vote for them.
Bud Light's trials this month have underscored the difficulty of straddling that divide. Ms. Heinerscheid's efforts reflected the company's aspirations of shoring up years of eroding market share among consumers in predominantly liberal urban areas. Ms. Heinerscheid did not respond to a request for comment.
The resulting furor, however, has led to double-digit sales declines in rural red-state markets, where a broader revolt against transgender rights has become central to Republican politics.
"They've stepped into a polarized America," said Benj Steinman, the editor of Beer Marketer's Insights, an industry trade publication. "They're in the center of the culture wars in a way that no company could possibly want to be."
On April 1, Ms. Mulvaney posted a video on her Instagram account showing off a custom Bud Light can featuring her face, which brand marketers had sent her as part of a March Madness promotion. A backlash and boycott quickly followed, driven by conservative media outlets and personalities like the musician Kid Rock, who posted an expletive-laden video on Instagram of himself mowing down several cases of the beer with a submachine gun.
Sales of Bud Light, the largest brand for Anheuser-Busch InBev, dropped 17 percent by value for the week ending April 15, compared with a year ago, according to one industry report. In a statement about the executives on leave, Anheuser said, "We have made some adjustments to streamline the structure of our marketing function to reduce layers so that our most senior marketers are more closely connected to every aspect of our brands' activities."
Despite the drop, Anheuser-Busch's stock has barely faltered and is currently near its high point in the past year, suggesting investors may believe the storm will be short-lived.
"Companies will not end the standard business practice of including diverse people in ads and marketing because a small number of loud, fringe anti-L.G.B.T.Q. activists make noise on social media," Sarah Kate Ellis, the president and chief executive of the L.G.B.T.Q. advocacy organization GLAAD, said in a statement. She noted that a 2020 survey the organization conducted in conjunction with Procter & Gamble found three-quarters of non-L.G.B.T.Q. Americans were comfortable seeing L.G.B.T.Q. people in ads.
The boycott of Bud Light has divided prominent Republicans and campaign organizations, too. Many have rushed toward the latest front in the culture war, including several 2024 Republican presidential hopefuls.
Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur and Republican presidential candidate who has campaigned on criticism of corporate progressivism, has raised money off the Bud Light episode, which he argues is emblematic of how top corporate executives are increasingly embracing liberal cultural values at odds with their companies' consumers. "I think what Budweiser did would otherwise be inexplicable but for a corporate culture created by some of those top-down forces in American life," he said.
In an interview this month with the right-wing media personality Benny Johnson, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, who is expected to enter the 2024 presidential race soon, said, "It's part of a larger thing where corporate America is trying to change our country, trying to change policy, trying to change culture."
But others in the party have urged restraint in light of Anheuser-Busch's Republican campaign donations, which led supporters of L.G.B.T.Q. rights to boycott the company as recently as two years ago.
On his podcast this month, Donald Trump Jr., the former president's son, cautioned against "destroying an American and iconic company for something like this," criticizing the Bud Light campaign but reminding his audience of its parent company's history of donating to Republican political campaigns.
After posting an online fund-raiser mocking Bud Light this month, the National Republican Congressional Committee, which received more than $ 464,000 in donations from Anheuser-Busch last year, took down the page within minutes, The Daily Beast reported.
The extent to which the backlash against Bud Light has affected the company's sales is unusual. Other companies that have in recent years found themselves the target of ire on the right over race and gender politics, like Nike and Disney, or on the left over support of former President Donald J. Trump and his stolen election claims, like Goya Foods, have paid little for it with consumers.
Americus Reed, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who studies the intersection of social movements and consumer behavior, says that for many companies that have openly embraced racial justice politics and L.G.B.T.Q. rights in recent years, such gestures reflect an awareness that "it's another way to differentiate yourselves in a competitive marketplace."
He cited Ben & Jerry's ice cream, which has built brand identity and loyalty for decades in part by wearing its roots in the hippie enclave of Burlington, Vt., and its liberal politics on its sleeve. "Then suddenly that bucket is not just cream and sugar, it's something else," he said.
But Anson Frericks, who was Anheuser-Busch's president of U.S. operations until last year, said that logic didn't necessarily hold for his former company: a behemoth of a brand with a customer base that was historically divided more or less evenly between the two sides of the country's increasingly stark partisan divide, and with an identity associated more with Clydesdales, Americana and humorous Super Bowl commercials than social justice.
"There's an authenticity element to what Ben & Jerry's does," said Mr. Frericks, who is now co-founder and president with Mr. Ramaswamy of Strive Asset Management, an investment firm that has positioned itself against the trend toward socially and environmentally conscious investing.
"When you have these large corporations that have a historic brand identity, it just looks inauthentic when they're all of a sudden getting involved in these social campaigns." Anheuser-Busch, he argued, had "lost track of the consumer."
The company's backtracking, though, has left it with few defenders.
"This was their opportunity to say, 'We do stand with the L.G.B.T.Q. community and specifically the trans community,"' said Stacy Lentz, the chief executive of the Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative, the philanthropic foundation of the historic gay bar in Manhattan.
Ms. Lentz is also a co-owner of Stonewall Inn, which refused to sell Anheuser-Busch products during Pride weekend two years ago over the company's support of Republican lawmakers it considered anti-L.G.B.T.Q. She said the boycott had led to heartening conversations with representatives from the company, and she had been further encouraged by the promotion involving Ms. Mulvaney -- and dismayed by its retreat from it.
"They were going after the younger generation," she said. "But that's a really hard thing to do on a marketing level, to be all things to all people. And it failed massively."

Biden Has Something He'd Like to Tell You: [Op-Ed]

Author: Collins, Gail; Stephens, Bret

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Gail Collins: Well, Bret, it looks like Joe Biden will be announcing his re-election bid this week.
Bret Stephens: Proving my prediction from last week dead wrong.
Gail: I know you disagree with him on many issues, particularly relating to the economy.
But given the likely Republican presidential candidates, any chance you'll actually be able to avoid voting for him?
Bret: Arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Probably not.
It says something about the state of the Republican Party that the two current front-runners -- let's call them Don Caligula and Ron Torquemada -- are nonstarters for a voter like me. And I'm a guy who believes in low taxes, a strong military, broken-windows policing, entitlement reform, a border wall and school choice. That's the Nikki Haley side of the party -- now reduced to single digits of the G.O.P. base.
Gail: Sorry about Haley's failure to take flight. I know you were rooting for her.
Bret: Well, I'm still holding out hopes -- increasingly faint though they are.
On the other hand, I really, really wish Biden weren't running, for all the reasons we've discussed. He's just not a convincing candidate. And for all the talk of Donald Trump being unelectable in the general election, we've heard those predictions before. All it might take is a recession -- which is probably coming -- for swing voters to care a lot less about abortion rights in Florida or the Jan. 6 attempted coup than they will about jobs and the economy.
Aren't you a wee bit nervous?
Gail: Nervous? Just because we're talking about a presidential election in which one of the two major parties nominates either a loony ex-president drowning in legal problems or a deeply unappealing, extremely right-wing enemy of Disney World?
Bret: It's a game of Russian roulette, played with three bullets in the six-shooter.
Gail: As for the Democrats, I've already told you I think 80 is too old to be planning another presidential campaign. And Biden has been around so long, it's hard to make anything he talks about doing sound exciting.
But what you're worried about -- a popular reaction against a bad economy -- would be a problem for anybody in the party.
Bret: True, but Amy Klobuchar or Gretchen Whitmer or some other plausible nominee can't be accused of owning the economy the way Biden can.
Gail: Biden certainly has negatives. But Trump has a lot more -- all way more dire. And even if Ron DeSantis weren't a terrible campaigner, I can't see him winning over the electorate with his past plans to torpedo Medicare.
Bret: You're probably right about DeSantis, who seems too obsessed trying to slay Mickey and Minnie to appeal to regular voters outside Florida. As for Trump, this is a strange thing to say, but: The guy has demon energy. You know the movie "Cocaine Bear"? Trump is "Diet Coke Cujo," if you get my Stephen King reference.
Gail: Yeah, he's never boring. Sigh. But we'll see how energetic he looks when he's defending himself for falsifying business records and all the other investigations that await him.
Alas, we'll be conversing about this for a very long time, Bret. On the more immediate horizon, there's the Fox News-Dominion settlement. Tell me your thoughts.
Bret: I am sorry we didn't get to watch Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham and the rest of the gang of cynical, lying, repulsive and wretched propagandists squirm under oath in courtroom testimony. Would have paid money just to see that.
But realistically speaking, it's probably the best possible result. It's the closest Fox will ever come to admitting guilt, $ 787.5 million is rich vindication for Dominion, and it spares us the possibility of an appeals process that might have ended with the Supreme Court revisiting the strict libel standards of Times v. Sullivan and potentially limiting the freedom of the press.
Gail: Yeah, for all my daydreams about Fox celebrities having to get up in court and apologize to the nation, in the real world this is probably the best you can get while protecting all the rights of a free press.
Bret: The good news, Gail, is that Dominion still has suits pending against Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Newsmax and Mike Lindell, the MyPillow guy, along with a few others. And there's also the pending Smartmatic suit against Fox.
Having fun, making bank and doing good at the expense of creeps has got to be the greatest joy adults can have in a boardroom.
But we mentioned the Supreme Court. Any thoughts on the mifepristone ruling, staying the lower court's ban on the abortion pill? I'm relieved, of course, that the court will allow the pill to remain on the market.
Gail: Well, this is the nice thing about a democracy. You have the powers that be suddenly realizing the public is totally not on their side. So they fudge a little, dodge a little and quietly backtrack.
Bret: It'll be some irony if Republicans come to rue last year's Dobbs decision for making them unelectable in all but the reddest parts of the country -- and Democrats come to celebrate it for helping them cement a long-term majority that eventually changes the composition of the court so that abortion rights are restored.
Gail: But we're still a long way from living in a country where every woman has the right to control her own body when it comes to reproduction issues.
Bret: As the dissents from Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito in the mifepristone ruling make clear ....
Gail: I've always wanted to see state lawmakers from both sides get together on a package of reforms that would couple abortion rights with easily available, easily affordable health and counseling services for poor pregnant women.
Along, of course, with high-quality child care for low-income working mothers. Ahem.
Bret: Gail, would it shock you to know that I don't disagree with anything you just said? Of course, child care won't solve the root of so many of our problems, which is the near destruction of stable two-parent families in too many poor households. But that's a disaster whose cure lies beyond a government's ability to solve.
Gail: Wow -- government support for high-quality early education? I think I'm hearing a major change of heart. If so, gonna buy a very nice bottle of wine for dinner tonight and drink a toast to you.
Bret: I tend to soften in your presence.
Gail: Awww. Well, go on -- back to the issues of the day.
Bret: Speaking of disasters, your thoughts on Biden's E.P.A. rule controlling emissions from power plants?
Gail: A worthy effort to protect future generations from environmental disaster, and of course, the Republicans hate it.
Bret: There should be a better way of saving the planet than by using administrative means to impose high costs on industry that will inevitably be passed along to consumers in the form of higher energy prices -- which also hit poorer people harder -- while setting wildly unrealistic target dates for an energy transition.
Notice that I'm saying this and I still will probably have no choice but to vote for Biden. Unbelievable.
Gail: Our colleague Jim Tankersley wrote a great analysis about the ongoing crisis over raising the debt limit, which has got to get done this spring. And how more than half of the Republicans' 320-page version of a debt limit bill is actually about removing clean energy restrictions.
Bret: I'd need to see the fine print before making a judgment, but a lot of what passes for "clean energy," like biofuels, is really a dirty-energy, big government, big business boondoggle. As for the debt limit, it wouldn't be a bad thing if Biden showed any willingness to meet Republicans halfway on spending cuts and work requirements for able-bodied adults taking federal subsidies.
Gail: Bret, the debt limit is ... something responsible people take care of without creating a political crisis with demands they'll never achieve.
But hey, that's a mean way to end our talk. You're always great about telling me about something new you've just read. Go ahead.
Bret: Gail, I have to recommend Katie Hafner's smart and humane obituary on Richard Riordan, the last Republican mayor of Los Angeles and a man who brought calm good sense to a city reeling from riots and racial strife. Riordan was a warts-and-all kind of guy, who cracked some dumb jokes that would have probably been politically fatal in our cancel-culture age. But he also brought common sense and a strong work ethic to his job and embodied a Republican pragmatism that we could sorely use today. He was the last of nine children born to an Irish Catholic family -- California is better because his parents were persistent.

Staying Home, and Missing Benefits of the Office: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: One of the first major studies on remote work shows a hidden penalty of flexibility: less supervision.
At least 10 times a day, Erika Becker, who works as a sales development manager at a technology company called Verkada, turns to her boss with questions. "Did I handle that correctly?" she asks. "What could I have done better?"
Ms. Becker, 28, comes into her office in San Mateo, Calif., five days a week, along with all her colleagues. The routine is a stark departure from her previous role at Yelp, where she worked from home and often spoke with her boss by phone just once in a day. Ms. Becker has rediscovered an upside of the office: feedback. Lots of it.
"It's like if there's something in my teeth, I want you to tell me," she said. "Because I want to move up in my career."
Since the start of the pandemic, sweeping workplace changes have arrived far faster than the research examining their effects. More than 50 million Americans, largely in white-collar jobs, began working from home at least part of the time. Many of them, especially working parents, became fiercely attached to the flexibility. In recent months, as large employers -- including Amazon, Disney and Starbucks -- have tried to call workers back to the office, thousands of employees have objected, pointing to a track record of productivity at home.
But remote workers may be paying a hidden professional penalty for that flexibility, according to a working paper from economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the University of Iowa and Harvard. The research is among the first major studies to demonstrate the professional downside of remote work.
The economists -- Natalia Emanuel, Emma Harrington and Amanda Pallais -- studied engineers at a large technology company. They found that remote work enhanced the productivity of senior engineers, but it also reduced the amount of feedback that junior engineers received (in the form of comments on their code), and some of the junior engineers were more likely to quit the firm. The effects of remote work, in terms of declining feedback, were especially pronounced for female engineers.
"We find a now-versus-later trade-off associated with remote work," said Ms. Harrington, an economist at the University of Iowa. "Particularly for junior engineers who are new to this particular firm, and younger engineers, they receive less feedback from their senior colleagues when they're remote."
The study's findings are preliminary and relatively narrow, directly measuring just one form of interaction among one set of workers at one technology firm. But the authors said their findings suggested something broader: that the office, at least for a certain type of white-collar knowledge worker, played an important role in early-career development. And the mentorship and training people get in person had so far proved hard to replicate on Slack and Zoom.
"It's what grandparents have been saying for a long time," Ms. Emanuel, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in an interview this month. "Face-to-face meetings are very different from FaceTime."
For some major employers, the research confirms a sentiment that has guided their decision-making on hybrid work: "It's hard to replicate the opportunities for apprenticeship and learning that come from in-person interactions," said Sara Wechter, head of human resources at Citi, where most employees are in the office at least three days a week.
At Verkada, the Bay Area-based technology company that called its workers back into the office five days a week, interviews with several employees showed why some people were choosing to leave jobs with flexible work arrangements in search of an office where they could cultivate relationships.
Morgan Shapiro, who joined Verkada in November 2020, had previously worked at Lyft, where she struggled to manage her team of recruiters once the pandemic sent workers home. When questions came up throughout the day, she worried about reaching out to her employees spontaneously, because she knew the anxiety that a sudden calendar invitation could provoke.
During her first week at Verkada, back in an office, she realized what she had been missing. She bumped into the company's chief executive in the hallway, and he invited her to set up a meeting to talk about her department's approach to compensation, which had come up during her job interview. She emailed his assistant to schedule the conversation right away.
"I also knew his assistant because I had gotten coffee with her," Ms. Shapiro, 36, said. "If I was remote, that would have been a lot harder because she would have said, 'Who is this person trying to get time with the C.E.O.?"'
Ms. Shapiro, who had a baby this year, noted that increased flexibility in her field had also made it easier for in-office employees to give priority to child care when crises arose. "Of course if you need to be home, be home," she said. "Home is first."
Ms. Shapiro's experience highlights a particular challenge for companies and workers navigating return-to-office tensions: The career penalty for remote work may be greatest for women, young people and people of color, who often lack the professional networks that being in the office can help provide. But numerous surveys find that those same groups of workers are also the ones who value flexible arrangements the most, and who are the least likely to return to the office voluntarily.
"Those who want remote work -- those who will likely take advantage of remote work -- are likely those who will lose jobs or at least lose out on opportunities because of remote work," said Kweilin Ellingrud, a director of the McKinsey Global Institute who has studied how remote work affects career development.
Worse, Ms. Ellingrud said, the price of flexibility may not be obvious to workers or companies until years later, when disparities in pay or promotion emerge.
Take Jackiez Gonzalez, 36, who works remotely in social impact for Best Buy, and signed up for a mentoring program for employees of color. She was told that participants would gather regularly to discuss career development. But she learned a month after signing up that she'd been accidentally left off the calendar invitations for meetings.
"When you're remote, you're out of sight, out of mind," Ms. Gonzalez said of the experience, adding that while she has largely felt positive about her flexible work arrangements, "there are growing pains."
The intangible benefits of in-person work have been challenging for researchers to study because they are, by definition, hard to measure. Existing studies of remote work have tended to focus on call centers or similar workplaces where productivity is easy to define and measure -- but where creativity, collaboration and mentorship may be less important.
Ms. Emanuel and her colleagues focused on software engineers at a Fortune 500 technology company, which the researchers had agreed not to identify. Before the pandemic, some engineering teams at the company were working in the same building, holding meetings in person and interacting with colleagues in the cafeteria. Other teams were split between buildings and held most of their meetings online to avoid the 20-minute walk across the company's campus.
The economists were able to measure feedback by looking at the number of comments that engineers made on one another's code -- a routine and essential form of interaction at most software companies. They found that before the pandemic, engineers working in the same building received 21 percent more feedback than those working in different buildings. Once the pandemic hit, and everyone worked remotely, the feedback gap virtually disappeared, suggesting it had been physical proximity -- not some other difference between the groups -- that had led to greater feedback for in-person teams.
The "power of proximity," as the researchers call it in their paper's title, was particularly large for newly hired engineers, younger workers and women. Engineers under age 30, for example, tended to receive more feedback, especially from their more experienced colleagues -- but only if they were all in the same building.
"These effects are really concentrated," Ms. Emanuel said. "The folks who really benefit the most from being in person are junior engineers and also are younger. Those are the groups that you might imagine have the most to learn."
Notably, engineers -- especially younger workers and women -- who had previously been on teams that were all in the same building were more likely to quit their jobs once the pandemic sent everyone home. There was no such surge in departures among people who had previously worked on teams spread across multiple buildings. That suggested workers missed in-person interactions, Ms. Emanuel said.
The challenge for companies is that remote work has also brought real benefits for many employees, particularly for working parents and others juggling responsibilities at work and at home. In a survey from FlexJobs, the remote job search site, 60 percent of women and 52 percent of men said they would consider looking for a new job if they could no longer work remotely; 62 percent of women and 56 percent of men said better work-life balance was a benefit of remote work.
"Employee sentiment on remote work is crystal clear," said Reyhan Ayas, senior economist at Revelio Labs, which collects and analyzes job postings, layoff notices and other work force data. "Employees, if they are able to work from home, would like to work from home."
Many companies have embraced a hybrid model, permitting some employees to work remotely while allowing or requiring others to be in the office. Still, the "power of proximity" paper calls that approach into question: The economists found that the benefits of in-person work apply only when an entire team is physically together.
"If you have even one remote teammate, that can still result in less collaboration between the remaining teammates," Ms. Emanuel said.
Still, many hybrid-work experts maintain that companies can find inventive ways of supporting their remote workers. There are even technologies emerging to enable that, including Gatheround, a videoconferencing platform that, among other functions, ensures all meeting participants get equal time to speak -- by cutting people off once they've gone on longer than their colleagues.

Full text: Investigators seized the Attic Greek cup from the Met last year. They, and others, doubt the museum's reconstruction of it from fragments was simply a product of genius.
The first shards of pottery arrived at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1978, a purchase from a Swiss dealer. A second handful was bought from a Los Angeles gallery a year later.
These ceramic tidbits -- part of the hodgepodge of ancient fragments that the museum routinely collected -- bore the unmistakable designs of ancient Greek pottery. A Met expert thought they were a small part of a significant artifact, a drinking cup known as a kylix.
In dribs and drabs over the next 16 years, a remarkable pattern emerged -- a Humpty Dumpty story with a happier ending. As hundreds of disparate shards of pottery arrived at the museum -- some as purchases, some as gifts -- dozens turned out to be parts of the same Greek kylix from roughly 490 B.C.
With great patience and puzzle-solving, the Met reconstructed the cup and decided it had been created by two notables of ancient ceramics: Hieron, the potter, and Makron, the painter.
One can imagine the excitement when the last fragment arrived in 1994. A terra-cotta kylix, created in Athens 2,500 years earlier, had been restored to life. The cup, 13 inches in diameter and depicting a man and a woman reclining on a couch, went on display five years later: an icon of ancient beauty as well as a testament to modern scholarship and technical expertise.
But law enforcement officials and a dozen archaeologists and art historians said in interviews that they believe that other, less serendipitous forces may also have been at work. They suggest that the individual shards of the kylix, which had likely been found together, were knowingly dispersed among dealers who sold them separately to the Met, their small size deflecting the kind of attention a complete cup would have drawn.
In September, the Manhattan district attorney's office seized the kylix, now valued at more than $ 1 million, and declared it the product of looting. The office cited as evidence old Polaroids of some of the fragments that had been taken prior to their arrival at the Met. The photos had been found in the Geneva offices of Giacomo Medici, an accused Italian antiquities trafficker.
Investigators were struck by the fact that the fragments from a single cup -- shards that had ostensibly lain together in the ground for centuries -- ended up in the hands of different dealers or collectors who eventually sold or donated them to the Met.
Three of them were later associated with the sale of looted antiquities.
A fourth, it turned out, was Dietrich von Bothmer, who for decades served as chief curator of Greek and Roman artifacts at the Met. After he purchased the other fragments for the museum, von Bothmer surprisingly found shards in his own private collection that nearly completed the piece, including the final fragment he gave to the Met in 1994.
Nowhere, according to the Met's records, did he or any of the others indicate where they had gotten the fragments.
David Gill, an archaeologist and fellow with the Centre for Heritage at the University of Kent in England, is among the experts who believe the Makron kylix was illicitly excavated just before pieces of it began showing up at the museum. He views it as another example of a long employed, but seldom discussed, practice of using fragments to market illicit antiquities because intact artifacts would draw too much attention.
"If the Met had bought this complete cup attributed to Makron, there would have been jumping up and down," Gill said. "Instead, it had bought a fragment, and it loses the impact."
"It looks," he continued, "as if they are just putting a jigsaw puzzle together."
Many experts believe the smuggling of illicit fragments became a black market routine. Some experts go further, suggesting that thieves at times smashed intact antiquities, destroying markers of history that had survived for millenniums.
Matthew Bogdanos, the prosecutor with the Manhattan district attorney's office who leads the Antiquities Trafficking Unit that seized the Met's kylix, said the breaks in fragments on some cups appear to have been made strategically so that figures on the pottery remain intact.
"It does make you wonder how many items they destroyed before they got good at it," he said.
Other experts, though, say looters do not have the patience to undertake a scheme that can take a decade or more to unfold. And even cumulatively, they argue, fragments from a cup would not nearly match the price of an intact artifact.
"They are worth much more unbroken!" said J. Michael Padgett, the former curator of ancient art at the Princeton University Art Museum.
Ancient artifacts, he said, are reconstructed, not through the intrigue of conspirators, but because expert, methodical researchers, with many contacts and special databases, are capable of making matches from a universe of orphaned shards.
But those who embrace the fragment theory suggest that there is little value to an intact vase if it can't be successfully exported and that the prices of fragments soar if they are the last of the missing pieces.
"The first three fragments are not going to be of great value," Bogdanos said. "Now more come on the market and the price of the fragments is driven up. The dealer says, 'Hey, there are four more pieces!' Now you want to pay more -- I call it 'incentivized buying."'
'Like Truffles Underground'
The Met's kylix was created during the golden age of Greek pottery, a period from about 550 B.C. to 350 B.C., when painters depicted all manner of scenes from mythology, wars, sports and the erotic encounters of humans, satyrs and gods. The Greeks used the cups, made from the country's iron-rich clay, at symposiums, the sometimes bawdy drinking parties that featured music, poetry and debate.
The kylix is thought to have traveled to Italy in trade with the Etruscans, whose civilization dominated central Italy in the centuries before the rise of the Roman republic.
Rich Etruscans coveted Attic pottery, which they most likely used for banquets, for daily life and as sanctuary offerings to a deity. Thousands of artifacts like the kylix were found in tombs, perhaps intended for use in the afterlife.
"The Etruscans were interested in the mythic stories depicted on many vases and also their role in drinking culture, as well as their beauty," said Sheramy Bundrick, a professor of art history at the University of South Florida. "It gave them cachet."
One early British collector, John Disney, explored an ancient Italian site in the 1820s and said that the remains of ancient vases were so plentiful they "seem to grow there like truffles underground." Some artifacts had been reduced to shards found buried just yards below the surface; others were discovered intact, protected by the volcanic rock from which Etruscan tombs were often carved.
Over time, thousands of the vases have been reconstructed from fragments found alongside each other. What some experts are concerned about are those rarer instances when vases have been reconstructed from shards that scattered and then turned up in the hands of multiple dealers.
Michael Vickers, professor emeritus of archaeology at Oxford University and a former curator at its Ashmolean Museum, is among those experts who said the sharp, crisp edges of some fragments are evidence of fresh breaks that occurred in modern, not ancient, times. A piece of pottery that lay in the ground for 2,500 years would have more rounded, worn edges, he said.
Daniela Rizzo, an expert in illicit trafficking, said that while she agrees dealers have parceled out fragments from broken pottery in schemes intended to deflect attention, she does not think there is much intentional shattering of pottery by the thieves.
Rizzo, whose work over the past three decades helped Italy recover dozens of artifacts from foreign museums, said ancient vases break underground for many reasons. "The breakage is not voluntary, I've always rejected this hypothesis," she said.
A Puzzle With 2,500-Year-Old Pieces
In 1981, von Bothmer began to reconstruct the kylix, using the initial fragments that the Met had purchased.
He had already established himself as one of the greatest connoisseurs of ancient Greek art. Born in Germany, he studied at Oxford under Sir John Beazley, the legendary Greek art scholar, and moved to the United States where he served in the Army in the South Pacific and received a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart for bravery.
He had run into a bit of rough seas in 1972 when he persuaded the Met to purchase another ancient Greek vase, the Euphronios krater, for $ 1 million, an astounding sum at the time, from Robert Hecht, a major dealer who the authorities accused several times of antiquities trafficking but who was never convicted.
Italian authorities almost immediately demanded it back, saying it had been looted only a year earlier from an Etruscan tomb, and there was feverish attention in the press on their complaint. (The Met ultimately returned the krater in 2008.)
But von Bothmer's expert reputation only grew, in part because he was so accomplished at reassembling ancient vases from fragments with the help of conservators.
"It does require great knowledge, photographic memory and ability to understand, connoisseurship to identify and group them by author," said Sean Hemingway, the current lead curator of Greek and Roman art at the Met.
In a 1982 film, von Bothmer explained the epiphanies that helped him match fragments he had seen in disparate locations. "You come to the almost instant recognition that what you have in front of you on a Saturday afternoon in Paris," he said, "is bound to join a fragment perhaps not more than 2 ½ inches across in Oxford."
Von Bothmer did not leave detailed records of the process he used in recreating the kylix. But photographs of the Met's first reconstruction in 1981 show about two dozen fragments set against a modern white plaster bowl. Then and now conservators use a special reversible adhesive so that any joins can be easily undone.
The Met's current head of conservation, Lisa Pilosi, said that when remaking a cup, it's important to first check to see if the fragments are stable enough to handle without flaking.
"If there is an image," she said, "that makes it easier, just like a jigsaw puzzle. If not, you just have to go by the edges."
"It takes patience, someone who can see in three dimensions in their head," she said, adding, "it's not for someone who just needs instant gratification."
In 1988, the next batch of fragments arrived at the Met, sold to the museum by the owner of a gallery in Switzerland. The following year, two more fragments that fit the cup came to the Met, this time as a gift from von Bothmer's own extensive private collection.
Von Bothmer had become a voracious collector of ancient Greek artifacts, though some experts later discouraged curators from collecting privately in the same area of interest as their museum expertise, given the potential conflicts of interest.
"If donors know you are a collector, it opens the door to all kinds of situations where there could be rewards of the kind, 'I give this to the museum and this to you,"' said Elizabeth Marlowe, an art historian and the director of the museum studies program at Colgate University in New York.
The Met, however, says collecting by its curators is permitted under its guidelines, as long as any prospective purchase is offered to the Met first.
Slowly, the cup was coming into focus as the fragments arrived. It was a so-called red-figure kylix, a style in which the reddish figures are set against darkened backgrounds and have finer facial details -- innovations that introduced greater realism to Greek art. Von Bothmer had already attributed it to Makron, a painter celebrated in particular for his depiction of women and their garments.
On the interior of the cup, a bearded man and a woman in partial dress recline on a couch at a symposium, or drinking revel. The woman, perhaps a prostitute, is shown flicking dregs of wine from a cup at a target in a game the Greeks called kottabos. On the cup's exterior, older men pursue younger ones. One youth holds a cock, a love gift. Another holds a sponge for oils and a strigil, an instrument for scraping oil and sweat from the body.
The names of three men -- Hippodamas, Eukrates and Euryptolemos -- are inscribed on the outside, each followed by the word "kalos," which means "is handsome" or "is beautiful."
In 1994, some 16 years after the first fragments arrived, a final singular shard was given to the Met, again a gift from von Bothmer. He left no record of where he had gotten it, but at that point he carried out the final reconstruction that completed the cup.
"Dietrich turned what was a bunch of fragments into something that was beautiful," said Hemingway, the Met curator.
Coincidence, Connoisseurship or Conspiracy?
It is not clear how the dozens of fragments that were used to reconstruct the kylix came to be so widely dispersed. But it is clear, investigators said, that three of the dealers who sold those fragments to the Met would be linked to the illegal trafficking of antiquities.
And all of them had some kind of relationship with von Bothmer.
Fritz Bürki, who sold the Met the first fragments in 1978, was an expert in the reassembly of fractured artifacts. He had rebuilt the infamous Euphronios krater for Hecht, the dealer who sold it to von Bothmer and the Met. In 2001, Bürki admitted knowing that many artifacts he restored had been looted and that he occasionally acted as a frontman for Hecht in the sale of such artifacts, according to court records.
The second set of kylix fragments came from Summa Gallery, a Los Angeles dealership in which Hecht had partnered with Bruce McNall, a colorful U.S. businessman. McNall, a former part owner of the Los Angeles Kings hockey team who once owned a Canadian Football League team with the actor John Candy and Wayne Gretzky, said in an interview that he could not remember the kylix fragments.
But he acknowledged that Hecht often purchased items from Medici, the dealer who had Polaroids that showed parts of the kylix. The photographs were found during a 1995 raid on Medici's Geneva storeroom that turned up a hoard of looted artifacts and thousands of photographs of items that the authorities view as stolen.
"To my knowledge, everything was coming from wrong sources back then," McNall said. No one in the art world, he said, showed particular concern, including curators who he said thought they were preserving for public display items that might otherwise disappear into private collections.
In an interview, Medici said he could not recall the kylix and disputed the contention that the Polaroids constituted evidence that the depicted fragments had passed through his hands. He said he was frequently sent photographs by other dealers.
McNall, who unlike Hecht was never accused of antiquities trafficking, said he did not knowingly participate in any organized scheme to sell the kylix in pieces to the Met. But he agreed that dealers would parcel out fragments over time, in part to ensure that prices would escalate as collectors or museums closed in on completing an object.
"The last pieces are so valuable," he said.
The last of the fragments sold to the Met came in a 1988 purchase from Frieda Tchacos, a dealer who gave the Met a fragment for a second cup in 1990 to honor von Bothmer. Tchacos was arrested by Italian authorities in Cyprus in 2002 on charges of trafficking in looted art. She received an 18-month suspended sentence for handling smuggled goods.
Investigators with the Manhattan district attorney's office said that, based on a witness account, they believe Tchacos, who could not be reached for comment, had gotten her kylix fragments from Raffaele Monticelli, a man U.S. and Italian authorities identified as a major tomb raider before his death last year.
Some of the dealers who sold fragments to the Met had not been charged with any crimes related to antiquities when their fragments came to the museum. But Bogdanos said an expert like von Bothmer "could not have not known that these objects were looted."
In the late 1970s, concern in the museum world over looted objects did not burn as brightly as it does today. By the 1990s, though, when von Bothmer donated his last fragment to the reconstruction, museums had embraced stricter guidelines that frowned on the acquisition of ancient objects that lacked a back story.
"From the very first fragment, it was the responsibility of the Met to verify that they are not putting themselves in trouble," especially after the outcry over the Euphronios krater, said Christos Tsirogiannis, a forensic archaeologist and head of illicit antiquities research at the Ionian University in Greece. "Instead, in this case they collected all these fragments out of thin air with a provenance that had no details" beyond the names of the immediate suppliers.
Von Bothmer, who died in 2009, had long denied being lax in his acquisition standards or cavalier in accepting the krater.
"A dog shouldn't be treated the way they treated me," he said in an interview in 1972.
In a statement, the Met said: "All acquisitions met the Museum's standards at that time. As laws and guidelines on collecting have changed over time, so have The Met's policies and procedures."
The experts who dispute the theory that fragments are used to aid smuggling argue that shards could easily become dispersed at an archaeological dig if someone discovered a key shard first, paying less attention to other pieces that might have been farther away, and leaving them in the ground for others to find later in second or third digs.
Dealers, these experts said, are typically rivals unlikely to conspire with competitors, but capable of letting fragments become separated in the tumult of a busy workshop.
The seeming serendipity of their coming together in a museum can be explained by the strength of von Bothmer's expertise, Padgett, the former Princeton curator, said.
"Bothmer had a good eye," said Padgett, who called him "a man of deep principles."
But Marlowe, the art historian from Colgate, said the remarkable reunification of long lost fragments suggested other forces may have been at work.
"There are tens of thousands of fragments out there," she said. "I don't care how big your contact book is, there is no way you are going to connect the dots unless you already have advance knowledge and notification to look out for, say, some guy's left arm."
At his death, von Bothmer bequeathed the Met some 16,000 fragments, some of which are on display today in one of the two galleries named for him at the museum.
Occupying a central spot in one of the galleries is a second cup by Makron and Hieron that von Bothmer also put together from fragments.
It, too, is remarkable, not just because of its craftwork or the careful way it was reconstructed. Like the kylix just returned to Italy, the pieces for this second cup came to the Met over time from the very same group as the first: Bürki, Tchacos, McNall's gallery and von Bothmer himself, with an additional shard donated by Elizabeth Hecht, the tainted dealer's wife.
Bogdanos said he was aware of the second cup, describing it as an artifact of interest but not one currently part of an investigation.
It is hard, though, he said, to embrace the notion that some museum curators were just blessed when it came to finding the pieces they needed.
"Of all of the millions upon millions of fragments in the world, of all of the thousands of museums, of all the gin joints in the world, all the fragments came into my place?" he said. "And that's a coincidence?"

Full text: TAMPA, Fla. -- Did you hear about the women who hid all night underneath the truck?
Rumors were flying outside the Raymond James Stadium more than 36 hours before Taylor Swift took the stage of the 75,000-seat site on Florida's west coast.
They went from person to person, as in a children's game of telephone. But the lines outside the stadium last week were made up of fans of all ages willing to put up with hours of discomfort to buy souvenirs tied to the singer's Eras Tour. Many of them arrived well before sunrise.
When word went out that certain prize items might be sold out, some Swifties spoke darkly of resellers with suitcases who had bought up boxes of T-shirts and sweatshirts at previous tour stops. There was also talk that a couple of women had spent the night beneath a merchandise truck.
That turned out to be true. One of the women, Larisa Roberts, had the selfies to prove it -- grainy photos showing that she and a friend had spent hours taking shelter from the rain under the official Eras truck.
"No one was here," Ms. Roberts, an interior decorator from Trinity, Fla., said of the scene outside the stadium when she arrived between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. on Wednesday. She added that she planned to buy sweatshirts for her daughters, Lilly and Daisy.
Shirley Vogler, a nurse in Tampa, said she had made it to the Eras truck at 10 p.m. the night before. Like other early arrivals, she had been moved from spot to spot by security guards in the rainy predawn hours. At 5:45 a.m., she was among the hundreds of people camped out on a sidewalk next to the six-lane West Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. Ms. Vogler, 31, was seated on the ground toward the front, chatting with two other women whom she had befriended.
Fans were able to buy merchandise inside the stadium on each of the three nights that Ms. Swift would perform at the home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. So why bother waiting all night in the rain? Ms. Vogler, who had tickets to a show, said it was because of what she had seen on social media -- specifically, "the TikToks about how bad all of the arenas are with the merch lines and the traffic."
Several other fans mentioned having seen posts by Bailey McKnight-Howard, one half of the twin influencer duo @brooklynandbailey, an Instagram account with nearly nine million followers. A few days earlier, Ms. McKnight-Howard had put up pictures of herself waiting outside AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas.
She had also modeled a newly purchased blue crew neck sweatshirt, the most-sought after item among fans. Nearly every person outside the stadium on Wednesday morning was trying to buy one, or two, or as many as they were allowed to have.
There was nothing flashy about it. The sweatshirt had no sequins or embroidery or hidden pockets. It was just your average everyday sweatshirt, with Ms. Swift's name and "Eras Tour" printed across the front and the tour dates and the titles of her albums on the back. If you closed your eyes and conjured a blue crew neck sweatshirt with some writing on it, your mental image would probably match up with this in-demand item.
One thing that made it special was the fact that, unlike some other tour souvenirs, it was not available in the "merch" section of taylorswift.com. It was also, notably, the rare garment for sale that day without Ms. Swift's face printed on it. In the weeks since the start of the Eras Tour, fans had elevated this unexceptional article of clothing to cult status.
"Every Swiftie wants the blue crew," said Debbie Losee, a 60-year-old teacher who said she was waiting in line on behalf of her daughter.
The apparently limited supply made it even more prized. "The resale on the sweatshirts is $ 300, Jake!" one fan was heard shouting into her phone. She was correct. The sweatshirt is available on eBay for more than four times its $ 65 list price.
"I've been having nightmares about getting this crew neck," said Emily Rottkamp, a 20-year-old employee at Disney World. "I haven't been sleeping."
Alyssa Misay, a personal injury specialist from Land O' Lakes, Fla., joined the line before 5:30 a.m. She said her teenage niece had given her strict instructions: "'The sweatshirt, the sweatshirt!"'
"Social media just makes things a bigger deal than what they are -- like, almost unattainable," Ms. Misay, 36, said. "Like, if you don't have it, you're not cool in school."
Nearby, Venisha Jardin, a sophomore at Wiregrass Ranch High School in Wesley Chapel, Fla., wore a hooded plastic poncho to protect her from the rain. In the hours before sunrise, the glow from her phone illuminated the area around her. "I'm missing school for this," she said.
Her mother, Chrys, was sitting in a nearby parked car.
"I was like, 'There's no way I'm missing merch just to go to school,"' Ms. Jardin said, describing how she had managed to convince her parents. She added that she planned to buy at least five items, including the you know what.
Despite the chill in the air and the steady drizzle, spirits were high. Gina Delano, 27, walked up and down the sidewalk telling people she had a cooler full of free snacks and drinks. Wearing a cardigan that had gone on sale at taylorswift.com at the time of the singer's 2020 album "Folklore" (which includes the song "Cardigan"), Ms. Delano said she had traveled from her home near Buffalo.
"The weather could definitely be better," she said, "but if this is what it takes to get merch, then this is what we'll do."
Elsewhere in the line, Jess Montgomery, a wedding photographer from Dade City, Fla., cradled her 7-week-old son, Denver, in a blanket. Standing beside her was her 11-year-old niece. "I'll be 40 next year," Ms. Montgomery said, "and when she's my age I want her to look back and say, 'My aunt was super cool."' She added that she had struck out in her attempts to score tickets for any of the three sold-out Tampa shows.
The people outside the stadium included teenagers who had never known a world in which Ms. Swift wasn't an international superstar and women who had grown up alongside the 33-year-old singer. The hours of waiting gave them a chance to feel at home among hundreds of others who shared a love for Ms. Swift's songs about high school bullies and first loves, about heartbreak and loss.
"The worst kind of person is someone who makes someone feel bad, dumb or stupid for being excited about something," Ms. Swift said in a 2019 interview. It's a line that her fans have often quoted on social media in reply to the haters.
Shortly after 7 a.m., Matt Langel, a Tampa resident, was sitting on the sidewalk decked out in Pittsburgh Steelers gear while his daughter, Alexis, filmed the scene for her mother. Ms. Swift's music had become a lifeline for the family, Mr. Langel said, adding that his wife was disabled. "My wife, since she's been bedridden, pretty much Taylor is what got her through," Mr. Langel said.
At 8 a.m., two hours before the merchandise was to go on sale, stadium workers opened the parking lot. Some fans tried to respect the existing line as others rushed toward the front. Because many people had been waiting at different locations, there was a scramble. Fans who tried to abide by an honor system found themselves more or less out of luck.
"Everyone started running from all different directions," Ms. Roberts, the woman from under the truck, said after she had managed to secure a spot near the front of the line.
Farther back, some people squabbled with those trying to cut in. "Back of the line or I'm going to have to put you in jail," an officer with the Tampa Police Department can be heard saying in a video of the scene recorded by a fan and reviewed by The New York Times. Some people cheered as several of the apparent line-cutters obeyed his order.
As 10 a.m. approached, local TV news crews showed up to interview fans, and a helicopter whirred not far above the merch truck. Strong winds whipped across the lot, stirring up dust. Tears streamed down Haylee Lewis's face.
"I just feel like camping overnight is a little much," said Ms. Lewis, a 21-year-old college student who lives in Orlando. The line was already over 1,000 people long when she had arrived at 8:30 a.m., she added. "I understand it, maybe, for concert tickets, but for the merch line it's actually insane," she said.
There turned out to be two trucks selling merchandise. Next to the Eras truck, which was patterned with images of Ms. Swift's face, there was a plain black truck topped with a sign reading "COOL STUFF" in big red letters. Both trucks sold the same items.
Inside the trucks, sales people prepared for the rush, unpacking boxes of shirts, tote bags, light wands and posters. They wore black Eras Tour T-shirts, the same ones they would be selling for $ 45 apiece. (Online, some fans have complained that certain shirts fade noticeably after washing.) There was one rule for the day: only two blue crew neck sweatshirts per customer.
At 10 a.m., the line lurched forward. A pair of AirPods flew into the air and landed on the ground, their owner seemingly oblivious. Things progressed slowly as the fans who made it to the very front asked to see various sizes and mulled their options. The mood was tense but jovial.
Less than an hour later, the vibe shifted as word circulated that the prize sweatshirts had sold out. Anna Avgoustis, a 26-year-old fan, got one of the last ones.
"By the time I got to the front, they were taking them off the wall," she said. "I was like: 'Please give me the last one. I will do anything for you. I'll run you guys Starbucks."' A few hours later, true to her word, she returned with coffees for the sales crew.
Kristi Kall, 38, and her daughter, Kaylee, 11, said they would try to buy a sweatshirt at the concert. "I just wish they would have had a little bit more, because they knew that's what everybody wanted," Ms. Kall said.
"I'm a little upset," said Kaylee, who bought an Eras Tour-branded water bottle instead.
In the afternoon, Laura Gavagan, a 33-year-old fan in Baltimore who had come directly from the airport, joined the line outside the truck, her suitcase rolling behind her. "I'm getting some looks," she said.
Jaclyn Quinn, a high school English teacher from Joliet, Ill., said that Ms. Swift's work came in handy in her lessons. "We use 'The Man' to teach critical lenses and talk about the feminist lens versus the genderqueer lens," she said. "We use her song 'Bad Blood' to talk about metaphor." She bought an Eras Tour wall tapestry for her classroom.
As 5 p.m. approached, the salespeople began straightening up the trucks and peeling off the tour T-shirts. When asked if they got to keep the shirts they had worn that day, one of the workers said, "No." Instead, they folded them and returned them to the stacks to be sold to the next day's fans.
"Isn't that so gross?" the salesperson said. "Don't tell."

NEW YORK — The first shards of pottery arrived at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1978, a purchase from a Swiss dealer. A second handful was bought from a Los Angeles gallery a year later.
These ceramic tidbits — part of the hodgepodge of ancient fragments that the museum routinely collected — bore the unmistakable designs of ancient Greek pottery. A Met expert thought they were a small part of a significant artifact, a drinking cup known as a kylix.
In dribs and drabs over the next 16 years, a remarkable pattern emerged — a Humpty Dumpty story with a happier ending. As hundreds of disparate shards of pottery arrived at the museum — some as purchases, some as gifts — dozens turned out to be parts of the same Greek kylix from roughly 490 B.C.
With great patience and puzzle-solving, the Met reconstructed the cup and decided it had been created by two notables of ancient ceramics: Hieron, the potter, and Makron, the painter.
One can imagine the excitement when the last fragment arrived in 1994. A terra-cotta kylix, created in Athens 2,500 years earlier, had been restored to life. The cup, 13 inches in diameter and depicting a man and a woman reclining on a couch, went on display five years later: an icon of ancient beauty as well as a testament to modern scholarship and technical expertise.
But law enforcement officials and a dozen archaeologists and art historians said in interviews that they believe that other, less serendipitous forces may also have been at work. They suggest that the individual shards of the kylix, which had likely been found together, were knowingly dispersed among dealers who sold them separately to the Met, their small size deflecting the kind of attention a complete cup would have drawn.
In September, the Manhattan district attorney’s office seized the kylix, now valued at more than $1 million, and declared it the product of looting. The office cited as evidence old Polaroids of some of the fragments that had been taken prior to their arrival at the Met. The photos had been found in the Geneva offices of Giacomo Medici, an accused Italian antiquities trafficker.
Investigators were struck by the fact that the fragments from a single cup — shards that had ostensibly lain together in the ground for centuries — ended up in the hands of different dealers or collectors who eventually sold or donated them to the Met.
Three of them were later associated with the sale of looted antiquities.
A fourth, it turned out, was Dietrich von Bothmer, who for decades served as chief curator of Greek and Roman artifacts at the Met. After he purchased the other fragments for the museum, von Bothmer surprisingly found shards in his own private collection that nearly completed the piece, including the final fragment he gave to the Met in 1994.
Nowhere, according to the Met’s records, did he or any of the others indicate where they had gotten the fragments.
David Gill, an archaeologist and fellow with the Centre for Heritage at the University of Kent in England, is among the experts who believe the Makron kylix was illicitly excavated just before pieces of it began showing up at the museum. He views it as another example of a long employed, but seldom discussed, practice of using fragments to market illicit antiquities because intact artifacts would draw too much attention.
“If the Met had bought this complete cup attributed to Makron, there would have been jumping up and down,” Gill said. “Instead, it had bought a fragment, and it loses the impact.”
“It looks,” he continued, “as if they are just putting a jigsaw puzzle together.”
Many experts believe the smuggling of illicit fragments became a black market routine. Some experts go further, suggesting that thieves at times smashed intact antiquities, destroying markers of history that had survived for millenniums.
Matthew Bogdanos, the prosecutor with the Manhattan district attorney’s office who leads the Antiquities Trafficking Unit that seized the Met’s kylix, said the breaks in fragments on some cups appear to have been made strategically so that figures on the pottery remain intact.
“It does make you wonder how many items they destroyed before they got good at it,” he said.
Other experts, though, say looters do not have the patience to undertake a scheme that can take a decade or more to unfold. And even cumulatively, they argue, fragments from a cup would not nearly match the price of an intact artifact.
“They are worth much more unbroken!” said J. Michael Padgett, the former curator of ancient art at the Princeton University Art Museum.
Ancient artifacts, he said, are reconstructed, not through the intrigue of conspirators, but because expert, methodical researchers, with many contacts and special databases, are capable of making matches from a universe of orphaned shards.
But those who embrace the fragment theory suggest that there is little value to an intact vase if it can’t be successfully exported and that the prices of fragments soar if they are the last of the missing pieces.
“The first three fragments are not going to be of great value,” Bogdanos said. “Now more come on the market and the price of the fragments is driven up. The dealer says, ‘Hey, there are four more pieces!’ Now you want to pay more — I call it ‘incentivized buying.’”
‘Like Truffles Underground’
The Met’s kylix was created during the golden age of Greek pottery, a period from about 550 B.C. to 350 B.C., when painters depicted all manner of scenes from mythology, wars, sports and the erotic encounters of humans, satyrs and gods. The Greeks used the cups, made from the country’s iron-rich clay, at symposiums, the sometimes bawdy drinking parties that featured music, poetry and debate.
The kylix is thought to have traveled to Italy in trade with the Etruscans, whose civilization dominated central Italy in the centuries before the rise of the Roman republic.
Rich Etruscans coveted Attic pottery, which they most likely used for banquets, for daily life and as sanctuary offerings to a deity. Thousands of artifacts like the kylix were found in tombs, perhaps intended for use in the afterlife.
“The Etruscans were interested in the mythic stories depicted on many vases and also their role in drinking culture, as well as their beauty,” said Sheramy Bundrick, a professor of art history at the University of South Florida. “It gave them cachet.”
One early British collector, John Disney, explored an ancient Italian site in the 1820s and said that the remains of ancient vases were so plentiful they “seem to grow there like truffles underground.” Some artifacts had been reduced to shards found buried just yards below the surface; others were discovered intact, protected by the volcanic rock from which Etruscan tombs were often carved.
Over time, thousands of the vases have been reconstructed from fragments found alongside each other. What some experts are concerned about are those rarer instances when vases have been reconstructed from shards that scattered and then turned up in the hands of multiple dealers.
Michael Vickers, professor emeritus of archaeology at Oxford University and a former curator at its Ashmolean Museum, is among those experts who said the sharp, crisp edges of some fragments are evidence of fresh breaks that occurred in modern, not ancient, times. A piece of pottery that lay in the ground for 2,500 years would have more rounded, worn edges, he said.
Daniela Rizzo, an expert in illicit trafficking, said that while she agrees dealers have parceled out fragments from broken pottery in schemes intended to deflect attention, she does not think there is much intentional shattering of pottery by the thieves.
Rizzo, whose work over the past three decades helped Italy recover dozens of artifacts from foreign museums, said ancient vases break underground for many reasons. “The breakage is not voluntary, I’ve always rejected this hypothesis,” she said.
A Puzzle With 2,500-Year-Old Pieces
In 1981, von Bothmer began to reconstruct the kylix, using the initial fragments that the Met had purchased.
He had already established himself as one of the greatest connoisseurs of ancient Greek art. Born in Germany, he studied at Oxford under Sir John Beazley, the legendary Greek art scholar, and moved to the United States where he served in the Army in the South Pacific and received a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart for bravery.
He had run into a bit of rough seas in 1972 when he persuaded the Met to purchase another ancient Greek vase, the Euphronios krater, for $1 million, an astounding sum at the time, from Robert Hecht, a major dealer who the authorities accused several times of antiquities trafficking but who was never convicted.
Italian authorities almost immediately demanded it back, saying it had been looted only a year earlier from an Etruscan tomb, and there was feverish attention in the press on their complaint. (The Met ultimately returned the krater in 2008.)
But von Bothmer’s expert reputation only grew, in part because he was so accomplished at reassembling ancient vases from fragments with the help of conservators.
“It does require great knowledge, photographic memory and ability to understand, connoisseurship to identify and group them by author,” said Sean Hemingway, the current lead curator of Greek and Roman art at the Met.
In a 1982 film, von Bothmer explained the epiphanies that helped him match fragments he had seen in disparate locations. “You come to the almost instant recognition that what you have in front of you on a Saturday afternoon in Paris,” he said, “is bound to join a fragment perhaps not more than 2 1/2 inches across in Oxford.”
Von Bothmer did not leave detailed records of the process he used in re-creating the kylix. But photographs of the Met’s first reconstruction in 1981 show about two dozen fragments set against a modern white plaster bowl. Then and now conservators use a special reversible adhesive so that any joins can be easily undone.
The Met’s current head of conservation, Lisa Pilosi, said that when remaking a cup, it’s important to first check to see if the fragments are stable enough to handle without flaking.
“If there is an image,” she said, “that makes it easier, just like a jigsaw puzzle. If not, you just have to go by the edges.”
“It takes patience, someone who can see in three dimensions in their head,” she said, adding, “it’s not for someone who just needs instant gratification.”
In 1988, the next batch of fragments arrived at the Met, sold to the museum by the owner of a gallery in Switzerland. The following year, two more fragments that fit the cup came to the Met, this time as a gift from von Bothmer’s own extensive private collection.
Von Bothmer had become a voracious collector of ancient Greek artifacts, though some experts later discouraged curators from collecting privately in the same area of interest as their museum expertise, given the potential conflicts of interest.
“If donors know you are a collector, it opens the door to all kinds of situations where there could be rewards of the kind, ‘I give this to the museum and this to you,’” said Elizabeth Marlowe, an art historian and the director of the museum studies program at Colgate University in New York.
The Met, however, says collecting by its curators is permitted under its guidelines, as long as any prospective purchase is offered to the Met first.
Slowly, the cup was coming into focus as the fragments arrived. It was a so-called red-figure kylix, a style in which the reddish figures are set against darkened backgrounds and have finer facial details — innovations that introduced greater realism to Greek art. Von Bothmer had already attributed it to Makron, a painter celebrated in particular for his depiction of women and their garments.
On the interior of the cup, a bearded man and a woman in partial dress recline on a couch at a symposium, or drinking revel. The woman, perhaps a prostitute, is shown flicking dregs of wine from a cup at a target in a game the Greeks called kottabos. On the cup’s exterior, older men pursue younger ones. One youth holds a cock, a love gift. Another holds a sponge for oils and a strigil, an instrument for scraping oil and sweat from the body.
The names of three men — Hippodamas, Eukrates and Euryptolemos — are inscribed on the outside, each followed by the word “kalos,” which means “is handsome” or “is beautiful.”
In 1994, some 16 years after the first fragments arrived, a final singular shard was given to the Met, again a gift from von Bothmer. He left no record of where he had gotten it, but at that point he carried out the final reconstruction that completed the cup.
“Dietrich turned what was a bunch of fragments into something that was beautiful,” said Hemingway, the Met curator.
Coincidence, Connoisseurship or Conspiracy?
It is not clear how the dozens of fragments that were used to reconstruct the kylix came to be so widely dispersed. But it is clear, investigators said, that three of the dealers who sold those fragments to the Met would be linked to the illegal trafficking of antiquities.
And all of them had some kind of relationship with von Bothmer.
Fritz Bürki, who sold the Met the first fragments in 1978, was an expert in the reassembly of fractured artifacts. He had rebuilt the infamous Euphronios krater for Hecht, the dealer who sold it to von Bothmer and the Met. In 2001, Bürki admitted knowing that many artifacts he restored had been looted and that he occasionally acted as a frontman for Hecht in the sale of such artifacts, according to court records.
The second set of kylix fragments came from Summa Gallery, a Los Angeles dealership in which Hecht had partnered with Bruce McNall, a colorful U.S. businessman. McNall, a former part owner of the Los Angeles Kings hockey team who once owned a Canadian Football League team with actor John Candy and Wayne Gretzky, said in an interview that he could not remember the kylix fragments.
But he acknowledged that Hecht often purchased items from Medici, the dealer who had Polaroids that showed parts of the kylix. The photographs were found during a 1995 raid on Medici’s Geneva storeroom that turned up a hoard of looted artifacts and thousands of photographs of items that the authorities view as stolen.
“To my knowledge, everything was coming from wrong sources back then,” McNall said. No one in the art world, he said, showed particular concern, including curators who he said thought they were preserving for public display items that might otherwise disappear into private collections.
In an interview, Medici said he could not recall the kylix and disputed the contention that the Polaroids constituted evidence that the depicted fragments had passed through his hands. He said he was frequently sent photographs by other dealers.
McNall, who unlike Hecht was never accused of antiquities trafficking, said he did not knowingly participate in any organized scheme to sell the kylix in pieces to the Met. But he agreed that dealers would parcel out fragments over time, in part to ensure that prices would escalate as collectors or museums closed in on completing an object.
“The last pieces are so valuable,” he said.
The last of the fragments sold to the Met came in a 1988 purchase from Frieda Tchacos, a dealer who gave the Met a fragment for a second cup in 1990 to honor von Bothmer. Tchacos was arrested by Italian authorities in Cyprus in 2002 on charges of trafficking in looted art. She received an 18-month suspended sentence for handling smuggled goods.
Investigators with the Manhattan district attorney’s office said that, based on a witness account, they believe Tchacos, who could not be reached for comment, had gotten her kylix fragments from Raffaele Monticelli, a man U.S. and Italian authorities identified as a major tomb raider before his death last year.
Some of the dealers who sold fragments to the Met had not been charged with any crimes related to antiquities when their fragments came to the museum. But Bogdanos said an expert like von Bothmer “could not have not known that these objects were looted.”
In the late 1970s, concern in the museum world over looted objects did not burn as brightly as it does today. By the 1990s, though, when von Bothmer donated his last fragment to the reconstruction, museums had embraced stricter guidelines that frowned on the acquisition of ancient objects that lacked a back story.
“From the very first fragment, it was the responsibility of the Met to verify that they are not putting themselves in trouble,” especially after the outcry over the Euphronios krater, said Christos Tsirogiannis, a forensic archaeologist and head of illicit antiquities research at the Ionian University in Greece. “Instead, in this case they collected all these fragments out of thin air with a provenance that had no details” beyond the names of the immediate suppliers.
Von Bothmer, who died in 2009, had long denied being lax in his acquisition standards or cavalier in accepting the krater.
“A dog shouldn’t be treated the way they treated me,” he said in an interview in 1972.
In a statement, the Met said: “All acquisitions met the Museum’s standards at that time. As laws and guidelines on collecting have changed over time, so have The Met’s policies and procedures.”
The experts who dispute the theory that fragments are used to aid smuggling argue that shards could easily become dispersed at an archaeological dig if someone discovered a key shard first, paying less attention to other pieces that might have been farther away, and leaving them in the ground for others to find later in second or third digs.
Dealers, these experts said, are typically rivals unlikely to conspire with competitors, but capable of letting fragments become separated in the tumult of a busy workshop.
The seeming serendipity of their coming together in a museum can be explained by the strength of von Bothmer’s expertise, Padgett, the former Princeton curator, said.
“Bothmer had a good eye,” said Padgett, who called him “a man of deep principles.”
But Marlowe, the art historian from Colgate, said the remarkable reunification of long lost fragments suggested other forces may have been at work.
“There are tens of thousands of fragments out there,” she said. “I don’t care how big your contact book is, there is no way you are going to connect the dots unless you already have advance knowledge and notification to look out for, say, some guy’s left arm.”
At his death, von Bothmer bequeathed the Met some 16,000 fragments, some of which are on display today in one of the two galleries named for him at the museum.
Occupying a central spot in one of the galleries is a second cup by Makron and Hieron that von Bothmer also put together from fragments.
It, too, is remarkable, not just because of its craftwork or the careful way it was reconstructed. Like the kylix just returned to Italy, the pieces for this second cup came to the Met over time from the very same group as the first: Bürki, Tchacos, McNall’s gallery and von Bothmer himself, with an additional shard donated by Elizabeth Hecht, the tainted dealer’s wife.
Bogdanos said he was aware of the second cup, describing it as an artifact of interest but not one currently part of an investigation.
It is hard, though, he said, to embrace the notion that some museum curators were just blessed when it came to finding the pieces they needed.
“Of all of the millions upon millions of fragments in the world, of all of the thousands of museums, of all the gin joints in the world, all the fragments came into my place?” he said. “And that’s a coincidence?”

Full text: With the release of "Guy Ritchie's The Covenant," here's a look at the occasional phenomenon of directors branding movies with their own names.
He turned Will Smith into a cerulean genie for the 2019 live-action "Aladdin" and twice reimagined Sherlock Holmes as a swashbuckling rogue, to hefty box-office returns. As a filmmaker, though, Guy Ritchie has long been synonymous with sprawling ensemble pictures like "Snatch," "The Gentlemen" and "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels": laddish, kinetic crime capers larded with movie stars, bloodied knuckles and inscrutable Cockney accents. (The latest of such outings, an antic international spy lark called "Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre" featuring Jason Statham, Hugh Grant and Aubrey Plaza, arrived to middling fanfare this past March.)
So why is "Guy Ritchie's The Covenant," a somber-looking Afghanistan war drama about an American sergeant (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his Afghan interpreter (Dar Salim), the first of the director's 15 features to formally bear his name? The answer, according to its U.S. distributor, MGM, turns out to be fairly prosaic: Another company had already asserted rights to the title. ("Lee Daniels' The Butler," produced by the Weinstein Company, faced a similar challenge in court from Warner Brothers in 2013 and lost, precipitating a hasty last-minute change.)
But this kind of déjà vu is hardly new: Broad-strokes monikers like "Crash," "Heat" and "Rush" have all done double duty over the last few decades; "Twilight" is the name of both a poorly received 1998 neo-noir starring Paul Newman and Susan Sarandon and the 2008 teen-vampire juggernaut that launched four fanged, lugubrious sequels, as well as a cult 1990 mystery by the Hungarian filmmaker György Fehér. (Ritchie might have called his latest‌ ‌ "The Interpreter" instead, had that appellation not already been claimed by a 2005 Sydney Pollack political thriller starring Nicole Kidman; so back, alas, to the drawing board.)
If the back story of "The Covenant" wanders into the weeds of copyright law, "Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio," which won the Academy Award for best animated feature last month, makes an easier case for its qualifier: Without it, the movie could hardly be set apart from both the 1940 Disney classic still widely seen as definitive and an uncanny remake led by Tom Hanks -- it currently sits at a grim 29 percent approval rating on the critical-aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes -- released less than two months before.
In a larger sense, though, the inclusion of del Toro's name also serves as shorthand and a promise, portending not only the age-old tale of a wooden boy made real but the particular vision of its maker -- a lush, prolific fantasist famed for the distinctive visual style and dazzling gothic grotesqueries of films like "Pan's Labyrinth" (2006) and the best picture-winning "The Shape of Water" (2017). That del Toro actually split directing duties for "his" "Pinocchio" with Mark Gustafson seems almost a footnote. Though Gustafson, an industry journeyman with a wide range of writing and animation credits ("Fantastic Mr. Fox," the original California Raisins), shared both the stage and the statuette with del Toro at this year's Oscars ceremony, it's the latter's renown, by most Hollywood metrics, that matters.
With "Pinocchio" and the 2022 Netflix horror-anthology series "Guillermo del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities," the director joins a long line of auteurs, from Alfred Hitchcock to Tim Burton, whose presence not merely above the title but in it serves as a stylistic marker, even when it's not strictly their hand guiding the material. (The horror godhead Wes Craven habitually did the same; see "Wes Craven's New Nightmare.") Few, though, can claim to be the one-man industry that is Tyler Perry, who retains full ownership of the projects produced under his personal shingle at his stand-alone studio in Atlanta. The multihyphenate creator has famously put‌‌ his signature on several movie and television titles released under its umbrella -- including "Tyler Perry's A Madea Homecoming," the most recent iteration of the reliably raucous comedies that he also writes and stars in as a salty, well-cushioned matriarch of a certain age.
While Madea is Perry's wholesale creation, indubitably linked to the man who wears her wig onscreen, certain intellectual properties with roots that reach back centuries have tilted their brims instead toward a more literal (and literary) acknowledgment of the source. Think of the high-gloss 1990s productions "Bram Stoker's Dracula" (directed by Francis Ford Coppola) and "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" (directed by Kenneth Branagh): It takes both the budget and the personal leverage of a prestige director, one presumes, to lay claim to the definitive versions of characters who have long been turned over to the public domain. Neither movie did much service to these iconic novels, but show business, as always, carries on: Coppola's four-decades-in-the-making passion project "Megalopolis," which wrapped shooting several weeks ago, was funded in part, he has publicly said, by his long-ago work on "Bram Stoker's Dracula." And Branagh, having recently mined his own Irish childhood for the dewy black-and-white drama "Belfast" (which won him an Oscar for original screenplay), will next direct and star as Hercule Poirot in his third Agatha Christie adaptation in six years, "A Haunting in Venice," due this September. Neither he nor Christie is officially billed in the title.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Speaking at the conservative Heritage Foundation, the Florida governor doubled down on his 2024 pitch, ignoring headlines about worried donors and Republican consolidation behind Donald Trump.
After a week in which little seemed to go his way, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida got back into his comfort zone: talking up his lengthy list of policy achievements in front of a receptive conservative audience outside Washington.
"We've really become the beating heart of the conservative movement in these United States," Mr. DeSantis said of his state on Friday morning as he addressed the Heritage Foundation, an influential conservative think tank celebrating its 50th anniversary. "Florida is the state where our shared ideas and values actually become political reality."
But outside that packed Maryland ballroom -- where the foundation's president, Kevin Roberts, suggested Republicans were "craving a bold and visionary leader" like the Florida governor -- the conservative movement has signaled some hesitation about Mr. DeSantis as he prepares for a likely 2024 presidential bid. Prominent donors have expressed concern, and Florida Republicans in Congress have so far shown little inclination to back him.
Underscoring Mr. DeSantis's biggest challenge is his continued avoidance of mentioning former President Donald J. Trump, who is well ahead in polls and has kept up a whirlwind of attacks on his potential rival. Even as Mr. DeSantis spoke, Mr. Trump shared several critical posts about him on Truth Social, the former president's social media website.
Mr. Trump's posts focused on days of negative headlines challenging Mr. DeSantis's political acumen and his handling of the fallout from a huge rainstorm in South Florida. The storm, which hit last week, flooded the Fort Lauderdale area and set off a severe gas shortage in the state's most populous region.
Both of Florida's Republican senators, in implicit swipes at Mr. DeSantis, have complained about the lack of fuel.
"They've got to get this thing fixed, this is crazy," Senator Marco Rubio said in a video on Twitter, without naming the governor. Senator Rick Scott wrote that "Florida families shouldn't have uncertainty about their next tank of gas."
Jeremy Redfern, the governor's deputy press secretary, defended the way the state had handled the gas shortage.
"At the direction of Governor DeSantis, the state emergency response apparatus has been at work since the flooding occurred and continues in full swing, responding to the needs of the localities as they are communicated to us," he said in an email.
At the Heritage event, which was attended by a mix of policy professionals, conservative activists and think-tank donors, the crowd greeted Mr. DeSantis with a standing ovation. Organizers estimated that roughly 1,000 people had shown up to hear him.
In his remarks, Mr. DeSantis leaned into his pitch that he would be the most electable Republican in 2024: He won the governor's office in a tight 2018 race, governed aggressively as a conservative and then earned a landslide re-election that included flipping liberal Miami-Dade County to the Republican column.
"We reject the culture of losing that has infected the Republican Party in recent years," he said before cycling through conservative highlights of his record, including his decision to reopen Florida's economy early in the coronavirus pandemic, his handling of Hurricane Ian and his signing of a new law prohibiting abortion in the state after six weeks of pregnancy.
Despite his electoral success, Mr. DeSantis has at times faced criticism for lacking a personal touch on the campaign trail. On Friday, he spent a few minutes shaking hands with attendees after his speech, at one point affably helping a woman navigate the camera on her phone for a selfie.
Ross Schumann, an attendee from Midland, Texas, who said he worked in the oil and gas industry and who ran for Congress in 2020, managed to get a brief handshake with the governor as his security detail ushered him toward the exit. He said Mr. DeSantis had hit all the right notes in his speech. But Mr. Schumann did not think the time was right for Mr. DeSantis to run for president.
"He's been very strong on getting policy wins, but this primary is Trump's to lose," he said.
Mr. DeSantis is learning just how tightly the party is wedded to the former president.
On Tuesday, he traveled to Washington seeking to court Republican members of Congress. But so far, the effort has resulted in little success. Several representatives, including some from Florida, have instead endorsed Mr. Trump. One of those lawmakers, Representative Anna Paulina Luna, tweeted a photo from a celebratory dinner at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's Palm Beach residence, where the former president hosted members of Florida's congressional delegation on Thursday night.
Other vulnerabilities have emerged as well. Potential rivals for the White House are slamming Mr. DeSantis over his fight with Disney, one of Florida's economic engines.
All of it is having an effect on the race for dollars. A prominent conservative donor, Thomas Peterffy, told The Financial Times last week that he was putting his donations to Mr. DeSantis "on hold," citing the governor's far-right stance on social issues.
Even little things seem to be going awry. Early Thursday morning, the state mistakenly sent a noisy emergency alert message to cellphones across Florida -- waking up startled residents and leading Mr. DeSantis to promise "swift accountability" on Twitter. (The state soon announced that it had terminated its contract with the software firm responsible.)
Soon after the governor ended his speech at the Heritage event, Steven Cheung, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, said in an email that Mr. DeSantis had "spent more time playing public relations games instead of actually doing the hard work needed to improve the lives of the people he represents."
Still, Mr. DeSantis's allies have dismissed recent skepticism of his prospects as Beltway hand-wringing that will not matter when voting begins in the early primary states next year.
"If you ask an Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or Nevada voter if he had a bad week, they won't see it that way," said Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, who is leading Never Back Down, the main super PAC backing the governor's expected presidential bid.
Mr. Cuccinelli, who served in the Trump administration, said conservative voters were responding to Mr. DeSantis's record as governor and his biography as a veteran, husband and father.
"When we tell that story, people get very excited," he said. "They see the fighter. They see the winner."
Although polls show the governor lagging well behind Mr. Trump, he is often pegged as voters' second choice -- suggesting he could coalesce support should the former president falter. Mr. DeSantis will next seek to elevate his foreign policy credentials on a state trade mission to Japan, South Korea, Israel and Britain that will start Monday.
And he retains the backing of the political donor Robert Bigelow, a Las Vegas real estate and aerospace mogul. Mr. Bigelow donated $ 20 million to Never Back Down -- roughly two-thirds of its recent fund-raising -- according to a person familiar with the super PAC's activities.
"I will give him more money and go without food," Mr. Bigelow told Time magazine.
While the Heritage event focused on the conservative policies that the group hopes the next Republican administration will embrace -- the think tank is working to build a database that could help staff the next G.O.P.-led White House and federal agencies -- it also demonstrated how conspiracy theories continue to course through parts of the party's base.
Before Mr. DeSantis arrived, an audience member raised a question during a panel discussion on the Justice Department, falsely telling the speakers that the Sept. 11 attacks had been an inside job.
The panel's moderator, the conservative writer Mollie Hemingway, interrupted to ask for the next question.

A Web Pioneer, BuzzFeed News Will Shut Down: [National Desk]

Full text: A quirky upstart that became a Pulitzer Prize-winning operation fell prey to the punishing economics of digital publishing.
In a move that brings to a close a pioneering era of online journalism, BuzzFeed is shutting down its namesake news division. After beginning as a quirky digital upstart and rising to a Pulitzer Prize-winning operation, it ultimately fell prey to the punishing economics of digital publishing that has laid low many of its peers.
It's a sobering end for a publication once seen as a serious challenger to legacy media outlets that had been slow to adapt to the internet. It was also the final chapter of a venture capital-fueled digital period that left an indelible mark on how journalism is produced and consumed.
When BuzzFeed News was founded in 2011, in the run-up to the next year's presidential election, it explored stories both slight and serious through listicles and click-bait-style headlines designed to go viral on social media. That mirrored the practice of its parent company, an internet laboratory of sorts that Jonah Peretti started in 2006.
The news operation soon drew attention for its ambitious, sharp reporting, however, and went on to open overseas bureaus and invest in investigative journalism. A number of alumni work for the more established news organizations it sought to disrupt, including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News, and those newsrooms have embraced many of the practices that BuzzFeed pioneered in search of readers online.
But for all its accomplishments, the news division failed to make money, unable to square the reliance on digital advertising and the whims of social media traffic with the considerable costs of employing journalists around the world.
Ben Smith, the founding editor of BuzzFeed News, who left in 2020 to be a media columnist at The Times, said in an interview that he was "really sad" about the closing.
"I'm proud of the work that BuzzFeed News did, but I think this moment is part of the end of a whole era of media," said Mr. Smith, who now runs the media outlet Semafor. "It's the end of the marriage between social media and news."
The closing of the news division is part of a broader round of job cuts at BuzzFeed, Mr. Peretti, the company's chief executive, said in an email to employees on Thursday. The shutdown of the news division will affect about 60 of BuzzFeed's roughly 1,200 employees, some of whom will be offered jobs at other parts of the company. The company will also cut 120 people across its business, content, tech and administrative teams.
The decision is the latest in a series of financial setbacks faced by digital media companies. Once the focus of enormous optimism and investment from industry titans including the Walt Disney Company and Comcast, new-media firms like BuzzFeed, Vox Media and Vice have failed to live up to their formerly lofty valuations.
Vox laid off 7 percent of its staff in January, blaming the uncertain economic climate. Vice, which has struggled financially for years, is desperately seeking a buyer. On Thursday, Insider announced that it was laying off 10 percent of its staff in the United States, a move the company attributed to broader economic headwinds.
BuzzFeed was part of a rising crop of media companies that capitalized on the growing dominance of tech platforms to deliver audiences to their stories, betting that profits would follow. BuzzFeed News peppered its headlines and boldface copy with phrases that would stop thumbs midscroll and was attuned to online conversations that many news organizations chose to ignore. Some of its traditional media competitors ultimately emulated BuzzFeed's obsession with its readers' habits, with editors glued to online dashboards created by companies like Chartbeat and Parse.ly to measure audience behavior.
But it was the tech titans, including Meta, Alphabet and ByteDance, that reaped most of the value from the huge audiences their platforms attracted, and the profits that those huge audiences suggested never materialized for BuzzFeed News. Digital advertising -- a mainstay for digital publishing companies -- is increasingly following young consumers to tech platforms like Instagram and TikTok.
Rafat Ali, the founder and chief executive of the digital media company Skift, said the demise of BuzzFeed News was a stark reminder that news organizations risked becoming obsolete if they didn't focus on developing multiple ways to make money.
"The age of disposable media is here," Mr. Ali said. "When you build your business on a trend -- in this case, social sharing -- and that trend comes to an end, so does your business."
In his memo, Mr. Peretti said he had "made the decision to overinvest" in BuzzFeed's news division because he loved the work it produced but acknowledged that he had been slow to accept that social media platforms would not provide the financial support needed to make Buzzfeed News profitable.
"I've learned from these mistakes, and the team moving forward has learned from them as well," Mr. Peretti wrote. "We know that the changes and improvements we are making today are necessary steps to building a better future."
BuzzFeed will continue to publish news on HuffPost, another digital media pioneer, which BuzzFeed bought in 2020. Mr. Peretti said in his memo that HuffPost was profitable and less dependent on social platforms. He added that the company was moving forward "only with parts of the business that have demonstrated their ability to add to the company's bottom line."
The financial pressures on the news division had been apparent for years. In Mr. Smith's coming book about the digital media era, "Traffic," he writes that there had long been confusion "about what BuzzFeed News was for." That became an issue during a contentious unionization drive at the company in 2019.
"I've come to regret encouraging Jonah to see our news division as a worthy enterprise that shouldn't solely be evaluated as a business," Mr. Smith writes. "Jonah resented what seemed like ingratitude from people whose work he so valued that he was approaching $ 100 million in losses."
In better times, BuzzFeed News was a beacon for up-and-coming political and investigative journalists. The site won a Pulitzer Prize in 2021 for international reporting for stories that used satellite imagery to report on the Chinese government's detention of Muslims.
While it won plaudits for its investigative work, becoming a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize in 2017 for an exposé into a corporate dispute-settlement process, it was also criticized for ignoring some of the norms followed by some of its more traditional competitors.
In 2017, BuzzFeed published a dossier full of unverified information about Donald J. Trump, who had just been elected president. The company's decision to publish the dossier was met with opprobrium by some media critics, who said it was irresponsible to make the information public without extensive vetting. BuzzFeed and Mr. Smith, the editor at the time, defended the decision, saying the public had a right to information that was circulating at the highest levels of power in Washington.
That same year, BuzzFeed News was sued by a Russian executive named in the dossier, who said the news organization had defamed him when it published its story. BuzzFeed won the lawsuit, and Mr. Smith said in an essay for The Atlantic on Thursday that he would make the same decision to publish again.
Newsroom employees had been told not to go into the office on Thursday. Mr. Peretti held an all-hands video meeting after the announcement, with some members of management joining from a New York meeting room unfortunately named "Operation Doomsday," according to a BuzzFeed staff member who was on the call and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.
Mr. Peretti told the workers that he had failed them, the staff member said. "It is clearly a massive failure on my part, and I am deeply sorry for it," Mr. Peretti said in the meeting, according to the person.
Mr. Peretti was asked if he would resign, and he said he was staying on at the company.
"I own this decision," he said, according to the person in the meeting. "Nothing that is happening today is about the work of this team."
Karolina Waclawiak, the editor in chief of BuzzFeed News, told employees in an email on Thursday that the newsroom had been making progress toward being profitable this year "only to be told -- four months in -- that we were out of time."
A spokesperson for BuzzFeed said the company was planning to keep all of the stories published by the news division archived on its website in perpetuity.
BuzzFeed News signed off on Thursday in the somewhat irreverent fashion it became known for over the last decade.
"BuzzFeed News is logging off with a reminder that Blippi pooped on his friend," read an Apple News push alert from BuzzFeed, alluding to a story by the outlet about an actor who plays a character from a prominent children's show.

An Artist Who Asks What 'American' Means: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: Jaune Quick-to-See Smith was sitting on the shore of a lake in Montana when she had an epiphany. An artist and curator, Smith was visiting the Flathead Reservation -- the home of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, of which she is a citizen. She'd been born on the reservation in 1940 and later moved to Albuquerque. On this trip, in 1991, as she looked out at the landscape that had helped shape her, she realized that she needed to do a better job of communicating. "I'm making paintings and I know what they're about but the viewer doesn't," she recalled in a recent interview.
Then came the light-bulb moment: Her works were about contemporary Native life, but they were more abstract, less direct in approach. "What if I cut articles out of the newspaper, glue them in, and paint on them, like Rauschenberg did?" she thought.
Smith liked Robert Rauschenberg's process of incorporating cutouts into his works, building his famous collage aesthetic that placed a medley of objects and images on equal footing. "But if I do it," Smith told herself, "I can make it so that it really says something."
She started placing newspaper clippings on her canvases and painting around and over them. As the idea took hold, she made the layouts more purposeful: juxtaposing excerpts from The New York Times and the Flathead Reservation's Char-Koosta News, as well as other printed snippets, that, when read together, became suggestive and rhythmic, creating what Smith calls her "rap." She added found images, bits of fabric, and more expressive passages of paint, all of it simmering behind large, simply rendered icons, like a canoe. In 1992, she hung above one such canvas a series of objects featuring racist Native stereotypes, including a baseball cap from the Cleveland Indians. With a twist of dry humor, she titled her piece, which stretched 14 feet long, "Trade (Gifts for Trading Land With White People)."
That monumental, still stunning artwork sits at the heart of "Jaune Quick-to-See Smith: Memory Map," opening this week at the Whitney Museum of American Art. The exhibition includes some 130 pieces from over five decades, making it the artist's largest survey. Smith's is the first retrospective of a Native artist that the New York institution has itself organized, a fact that's less surprising than it is vexing.
"It forces the question of, why not before? Why not more attention to contemporary Indigenous art?" said Laura Phipps, the Whitney's assistant curator who organized the exhibition with Caitlin Chaisson, a curatorial project assistant. "We're constantly questioning what 'American' means, but in a lot of those conversations, the idea of Native America has not been a part of that."
Smith's retrospective arrives as the map of the art world seems to be shifting: Contemporary Native artists have been more visible and sought after than ever before, in museum commissions and collections and in galleries. Smith, 83, also has a commission in Counterpublic, a new triennial in St. Louis, and is curating an exhibition featuring some 50 Native artists at the National Gallery of Art. The show, which will open in September, represents more overdue firsts: the first time an artist has ever curated an exhibition there and the first show of Native art at the NGA in 30 years.
But if the current wave of attention has opened up new possibilities for Indigenous artists, particularly younger ones, credit is due less to the institutions than to Smith and others of her generation for the tireless work they did to "break the buckskin ceiling," in her words. The Whitney retrospective makes that clear. Although Smith's curating and activism are represented only minimally, her paintings, prints and sculptures demonstrate how she took various modern and postmodern artistic languages, including collage, appropriation and Pop Art, and made them her own -- or, as she would say, made them Native.
Take, for example, "Trade (Gifts for Trading Land With White People)," which, according to the Choctaw-Cherokee artist Jeffrey Gibson, "offers so much allowance and freedom for Native artists." Gibson spoke of the challenges he has felt in trying to be a Native artist, activist, educator and parent simultaneously. "You need a unified model of how someone can be the same person in all those spaces," he said. "Jaune has provided that for me."
Smith has always occupied multiple roles. She and her sister were raised by their father, Arthur, after their mother, who gave birth to Smith as a teenager, left. Arthur was a horse trader, and while attending school, Smith worked with him -- and in canneries and on farms -- throughout her childhood. One of her favorite escapes was to hide in a tree and read books.
Smith didn't get an advanced art degree until she was 40. In high school, a white adviser told her, "Indians don't go to college," so she did college prep. When an art teacher told her she drew better than the men, but that "women cannot be artists," she got an art education degree. Along the way, she met her partner, Andy Ambrose, had children, and worked a variety of jobs to help support them. (Her son Neal Ambrose-Smith is also an artist; two of their collaborations are on view at the Whitney.)
In 1976, Smith moved to Albuquerque and started auditing art classes at the University of New Mexico, -- it took three applications until the school admitted her. There, she and the Indigenous artists Larry Emerson, Conrad House, Felice Lucero, Emmi Whitehorse and Paul Willeto formed a collective called Grey Canyon. "She's like a mother hen," said Whitehorse, who is Navajo and was then an undergraduate at UNM. "She took it on herself to teach me the ropes."
Grey Canyon provided emotional support, but Smith wanted their art to be taken seriously. She sought places for them to exhibit and in 1979 landed their first show, at New York's American Indian Community House. At the time, she was making pastels that referred to places that were meaningful to her. They look like enigmatic maps, with floating pictographs and tracks -- Smith's response to professors who emphasized abstraction. But when Grey Canyon exhibited at the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian in 1980, the members found that their modern paintings and abstract art clashed with some people's stereotypical expectations of Native artists. Whitehorse recalled that white board members "hated it. They said, 'What the heck are you doing? You should be at home, learning the craft your grandmothers are doing, making pottery and rugs."'
Smith's approach to organizing the Grey Canyon shows -- cold-calling anywhere she could think of -- established how she would go about much of her activism and curating for the next two decades: in a mode between seat-of-the-pants and "when the spirit moves me," as her father would say.
Her improvisational urgency has had remarkable results. Her projects include helping to save Albuquerque's Petroglyph National Monument and Santa Fe's Institute of American Indian Arts. She's also organized over 30 exhibitions, including important group shows of contemporary Native American photographers and women artists, and two exhibitions that rebutted the 1992 quincentennial celebrations of Columbus's arrival in the Americas.
Such work reflects her communal mind-set -- how she has expanded the space for Indigenous people in art by inviting others to give talks, connecting them to resources, or just writing notes of encouragement. "When I come through the door, I bring a community with me," Smith said. "I want there to be others after me." She attributes this to her heritage. "I'm still doing my dad's horse trading," she told me, only now what's being exchanged are ideas and support.
Molly Donovan, the National Gallery's curator of contemporary art, likened working with her to being "this lucky student in a pro seminar being taught by the pre-eminent voice on the subject. Jaune has a generous pedagogy; she freely shares her knowledge."
Smith's early solo gallery shows were in Santa Fe, then New York. She's continued to exhibit regularly throughout her career, but has nonetheless felt relegated to the periphery: seen and heard but not always fully understood, her work written about but rarely in real depth.
"We're marginalized," she said, "and actually, there's a certain comfort level in that. You don't have to worry about bad PR, because nobody writes about it -- nobody looks at it. So you can do whatever you want."
In Smith's case, that has meant honing her collage technique; introducing more icons, like the U.S. map and bison; and adjusting her colors and insistent strokes and drips of paint to better convey the clamorous contradictions of American Indian life. One potent painting, "Sovereign Nations" (2002), features three layered wingtip dresses decorated with American-flag stars (a nod to Jasper Johns's "Three Flags" from 1958, hanging upstairs at the Whitney). They're set against the text of the 1855 Treaty of Hellgate, which created the Flathead Reservation.
Part of what makes Smith's practice fascinating is the tension it carries between her embrace of more Eurocentric, modernist methods and her pro-Indigenous, environmentalist, anticapitalist messages. Those messages feel very contemporary and of a piece with art by Nicholas Galanin, Maria Hupfield, and New Red Order, yet these younger Indigenous artists' work is more formally experimental and often more direct.
"I'm caught between two generations," Smith told me: that of her father, whose childhood experiences of being beaten at an American Indian boarding school made him feel like he "couldn't say anything," and that of younger Native artists, who "can say things that maybe we felt like we couldn't," Smith reflected, "I don't think I have that freedom."
It's difficult to walk through her retrospective and reconcile that sentiment with what's on view. Her canoe piled with skulls and flag with Mickey Mouse ears suggest that despite limitations or fear, she has found ways to say what she needs to. In a recent painting, she took the U.S. map and flipped it sideways. The move dispels the map's authority, making it look precarious and absurd. In the center, amid yellows, reds and oranges, Smith added a cutout phrase that could serve as a secondhand manifesto: "NDN humor Causes people To survive."

Jaune Quick-to-See Smith was sitting on the shore of a lake in Montana when she had an epiphany. An artist and curator, Smith was visiting the Flathead Reservation — the home of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, of which she is a citizen. She’d been born on the reservation in 1940 and later moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico. On this trip, in 1991, as she looked out at the landscape that had helped shape her, she realized that she needed to do a better job of communicating. “I’m making paintings, and I know what they’re about, but the viewer doesn’t,” she recalled in a recent interview.
Then came the light-bulb moment: Her works were about contemporary Native life, but they were more abstract, less direct in approach. “What if I cut articles out of the newspaper, glue them in and paint on them, like Rauschenberg did?” she thought.
Smith liked Robert Rauschenberg’s process of incorporating cutouts into his works, building his famous collage aesthetic that placed a medley of objects and images on equal footing. “But if I do it,” Smith told herself, “I can make it so that it really says something.”
She started placing newspaper clippings on her canvases and painting around and over them. As the idea took hold, she made the layouts more purposeful: juxtaposing excerpts from The New York Times and the Flathead Reservation’s Char-Koosta News, as well as other printed snippets that, when read together, became suggestive and rhythmic, creating what Smith calls her “rap.” She added found images, bits of fabric, and more expressive passages of paint, all of it simmering behind large, simply rendered icons, like a canoe. In 1992, she hung above one such canvas a series of objects featuring racist Native stereotypes, including a baseball cap from the Cleveland Indians. With a twist of dry humor, she titled her piece, which stretched 14 feet long, “Trade (Gifts for Trading Land With White People).”
That monumental, still stunning artwork sits at the heart of “Jaune Quick-to-See Smith: Memory Map,” opening this week at the Whitney Museum of American Art. The exhibition includes some 130 pieces from over five decades, making it the artist’s largest survey. Smith’s is the first retrospective of a Native artist that the New York institution has itself organized, a fact that’s less surprising than it is vexing.
“It forces the question of, why not before? Why not more attention to contemporary Indigenous art?” said Laura Phipps, the Whitney’s assistant curator who organized the exhibition with Caitlin Chaisson, a curatorial project assistant. “We’re constantly questioning what ‘American’ means, but in a lot of those conversations, the idea of Native America has not been a part of that.”
Smith’s retrospective arrives as the map of the art world seems to be shifting: Contemporary Native artists have been more visible and sought after than ever before, in museum commissions and collections and in galleries. Smith, 83, also has a commission in Counterpublic, a new triennial in St. Louis, and is curating an exhibition featuring some 50 Native artists at the National Gallery of Art. The show, which will open in September, represents more overdue firsts: the first time an artist has ever curated an exhibition there and the first show of Native art at the NGA in 30 years.
But if the current wave of attention has opened up new possibilities for Indigenous artists, particularly younger ones, credit is due less to the institutions than to Smith and others of her generation for the tireless work they did to “break the buckskin ceiling,” in her words. The Whitney retrospective makes that clear. Although Smith’s curating and activism are represented only minimally, her paintings, prints and sculptures demonstrate how she took various modern and postmodern artistic languages, including collage, appropriation and Pop Art, and made them her own — or, as she would say, made them Native.
Take, for example, “Trade (Gifts for Trading Land With White People),” which, according to Choctaw-Cherokee artist Jeffrey Gibson, “offers so much allowance and freedom for Native artists.” Gibson spoke of the challenges he has felt in trying to be a Native artist, activist, educator and parent simultaneously. “You need a unified model of how someone can be the same person in all those spaces,” he said. “Jaune has provided that for me.”
Smith has always occupied multiple roles. She and her sister were raised by their father, Arthur, after their mother, who gave birth to Smith as a teenager, left. Arthur was a horse trader, and while attending school, Smith worked with him — and in canneries and on farms — throughout her childhood. One of her favorite escapes was to hide in a tree and read books.
Smith didn’t get an advanced art degree until she was 40. In high school, a white adviser told her, “Indians don’t go to college,” so she did college prep. When an art teacher told her she drew better than the men but that “women cannot be artists,” she got an art education degree. Along the way, she met her partner, Andy Ambrose, had children and worked a variety of jobs to help support them. (Her son Neal Ambrose-Smith is also an artist; two of their collaborations are on view at the Whitney.)
In 1976, Smith moved to Albuquerque and started auditing art classes at the University of New Mexico; it took three applications until the school admitted her. There, she and Indigenous artists Larry Emerson, Conrad House, Felice Lucero, Emmi Whitehorse and Paul Willeto formed a collective called Grey Canyon. “She’s like a mother hen,” said Whitehorse, who is Navajo and was then an undergraduate at UNM. “She took it on herself to teach me the ropes.”
Grey Canyon provided emotional support, but Smith wanted their art to be taken seriously. She sought places for them to exhibit and in 1979 landed their first show, at New York’s American Indian Community House. At the time, she was making pastels that referred to places that were meaningful to her. They look like enigmatic maps, with floating pictographs and tracks — Smith’s response to professors who emphasized abstraction. But when Grey Canyon exhibited at the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian in 1980, the members found that their modern paintings and abstract art clashed with some people’s stereotypical expectations of Native artists. Whitehorse recalled that white board members “hated it. They said, ‘What the heck are you doing? You should be at home, learning the craft your grandmothers are doing, making pottery and rugs.’”
Smith’s approach to organizing the Grey Canyon shows — cold-calling anywhere she could think of — established how she would go about much of her activism and curating for the next two decades: in a mode between seat-of-the-pants and “when the spirit moves me,” as her father would say.
Her improvisational urgency has had remarkable results. Her projects include helping to save Albuquerque’s Petroglyph National Monument and Santa Fe’s Institute of American Indian Arts. She’s also organized more than 30 exhibitions, including important group shows of contemporary Native American photographers and women artists, and two exhibitions that rebutted the 1992 quincentennial celebrations of Christopher Columbus’ arrival in the Americas.
Such work reflects her communal mindset — how she has expanded the space for Indigenous people in art by inviting others to give talks, connecting them to resources or just writing notes of encouragement. “When I come through the door, I bring a community with me,” Smith said. “I want there to be others after me.” She attributes this to her heritage. “I’m still doing my dad’s horse trading,” she told me, only now what’s being exchanged are ideas and support.
Molly Donovan, the National Gallery’s curator of contemporary art, likened working with her to being “this lucky student in a pro seminar being taught by the preeminent voice on the subject. Jaune has a generous pedagogy; she freely shares her knowledge.”
Smith’s early solo gallery shows were in Santa Fe, then New York. She’s continued to exhibit regularly throughout her career but has nonetheless felt relegated to the periphery — seen and heard but not always fully understood, her work written about but rarely in real depth.
“We’re marginalized,” she said, “and actually, there’s a certain comfort level in that. You don’t have to worry about bad PR, because nobody writes about it; nobody looks at it. So you can do whatever you want.”
In Smith’s case, that has meant honing her collage technique; introducing more icons, like the U.S. map and bison; and adjusting her colors and insistent strokes and drips of paint to better convey the clamorous contradictions of American Indian life. One potent painting, “Sovereign Nations” (2002), features three layered wingtip dresses decorated with American-flag stars (a nod to Jasper Johns’ “Three Flags” from 1958, hanging upstairs at the Whitney). They’re set against the text of the 1855 Treaty of Hellgate, which created the Flathead Reservation.
Part of what makes Smith’s practice fascinating is the tension it carries between her embrace of more Eurocentric, modernist methods and her pro-Indigenous, environmentalist, anti-capitalist messages. Those messages feel very contemporary and of a piece with art by Nicholas Galanin, Maria Hupfield, and New Red Order, yet these younger Indigenous artists’ work is more formally experimental and often more direct.
“I’m caught between two generations,” Smith said: that of her father, whose childhood experiences of being beaten at an American Indian boarding school made him feel like he “couldn’t say anything,” and that of younger Native artists, who “can say things that maybe we felt like we couldn’t,” Smith reflected. “I don’t think I have that freedom.”
It’s difficult to walk through her retrospective and reconcile that sentiment with what’s on view. Her canoe piled with skulls and flag with Mickey Mouse ears suggest that despite limitations or fear, she has found ways to say what she needs to. In a recent painting, she took the U.S. map and flipped it sideways. The move dispels the map’s authority, making it look precarious and absurd. In the center, amid yellows, reds and oranges, Smith added a cutout phrase that could serve as a secondhand manifesto: “NDN humor Causes people To survive.”

BuzzFeed News, Which Dragged Media Into the Digital Age, Shuts Down

In a move that brings to a close a pioneering era of online journalism, BuzzFeed is shutting down its namesake news division. After beginning as a quirky digital upstart and rising to a Pulitzer Prize-winning operation, it ultimately fell prey to the punishing economics of digital publishing that has laid low many of its peers.
It’s a sobering end for a publication once seen as a serious challenger to legacy media outlets that had been slow to adapt to the internet. It was also the final chapter of a venture capital-fueled digital period that left an indelible mark on how journalism is produced and consumed.
When BuzzFeed News was founded in 2011, in the run-up to the 2012 presidential election, it explored stories both slight and serious through listicles and click-bait-style headlines designed to go viral on social media. That mirrored the practice of its parent company, an internet laboratory of sorts that Jonah Peretti started in 2006.
The news operation soon drew attention for its ambitious, sharp reporting, however, and went on to open overseas bureaus and invest in investigative journalism. A number of alumni work for the more established news organizations it sought to disrupt, including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News, and those newsrooms have embraced many of the practices that BuzzFeed pioneered in search of readers online.
But for all its accomplishments, the news division failed to make money, unable to square the reliance on digital advertising and the whims of social media traffic with the considerable costs of employing journalists around the world.
Ben Smith, the founding editor of BuzzFeed News, who left in 2020 to be a media columnist at the Times, said in an interview that he was “really sad” about the closing.
“I’m proud of the work that BuzzFeed News did, but I think this moment is part of the end of a whole era of media,” said Smith, who now runs the media outlet Semafor. “It’s the end of the marriage between social media and news.”
The closing of the news division is part of a broader round of job cuts at BuzzFeed, Peretti, the company’s CEO, said in an email to employees Thursday. The shutdown of the news division will affect about 60 of BuzzFeed’s roughly 1,200 employees, some of whom will be offered jobs at other parts of the company. The company will also cut 120 people across its business, content, tech and administrative teams.
The decision is the latest in a series of financial setbacks faced by digital media companies. Once the focus of enormous optimism and investment from industry titans including The Walt Disney Co. and Comcast, new-media firms like BuzzFeed, Vox Media and Vice have failed to live up to their formerly lofty valuations.
Vox laid off 7% of its staff in January, blaming the uncertain economic climate. Vice, which has struggled financially for years, is desperately seeking a buyer. On Thursday, Insider announced that it was laying off 10% of its staff in the United States, a move the company attributed to broader economic headwinds.
BuzzFeed was part of a rising crop of media companies that capitalized on the growing dominance of tech platforms to deliver audiences to their stories, betting that profits would follow. BuzzFeed News peppered its headlines and boldface copy with phrases that would stop thumbs midscroll and was attuned to online conversations that many news organizations chose to ignore. Some of its traditional media competitors ultimately emulated BuzzFeed’s obsession with its readers’ habits, with editors glued to online dashboards created by companies like Chartbeat and Parse.ly to measure audience behavior.
But it was the tech titans, including Meta, Alphabet and ByteDance, that reaped most of the value from the huge audiences their platforms attracted, and the profits that those huge audiences suggested never materialized for BuzzFeed News. Digital advertising — a mainstay for digital publishing companies — is increasingly following young consumers to tech platforms like Instagram and TikTok.
Rafat Ali, the founder and CEO of the digital media company Skift, said the demise of BuzzFeed News was a stark reminder that news organizations risked becoming obsolete if they didn’t focus on developing multiple ways to make money.
“The age of disposable media is here,” Ali said. “When you build your business on a trend — in this case, social sharing — and that trend comes to an end, so does your business.”
In his memo, Peretti said he had “made the decision to overinvest” in BuzzFeed’s news division because he loved the work it produced but acknowledged that he had been slow to accept that social media platforms would not provide the financial support needed to make BuzzFeed News profitable.
“I’ve learned from these mistakes, and the team moving forward has learned from them as well,” Peretti wrote. “We know that the changes and improvements we are making today are necessary steps to building a better future.”
BuzzFeed will continue to publish news on HuffPost, another digital media pioneer, which BuzzFeed bought in 2020. Peretti said in his memo that HuffPost was profitable and less dependent on social platforms. He added that the company was moving forward “only with parts of the business that have demonstrated their ability to add to the company’s bottom line.”
The financial pressures on the news division had been apparent for years. In Smith’s coming book about the digital media era, “Traffic,” he writes that there had long been confusion “about what BuzzFeed News was for.” That became an issue during a contentious unionization drive at the company in 2019.
“I’ve come to regret encouraging Jonah to see our news division as a worthy enterprise that shouldn’t solely be evaluated as a business,” Smith writes. “Jonah resented what seemed like ingratitude from people whose work he so valued that he was approaching $100 million in losses.”
In better times, BuzzFeed News was a beacon for up-and-coming political and investigative journalists. The site won a Pulitzer Prize in 2021 for international reporting for stories that used satellite imagery to report on the Chinese government’s detention of Muslims.
While it won plaudits for its investigative work, becoming a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize in 2017 for an exposé into a corporate dispute-settlement process, it was also criticized for ignoring some of the norms followed by some of its more traditional competitors.
In 2017, BuzzFeed published a dossier full of unverified information about Donald Trump, who had just been elected president. The company’s decision to publish the dossier was met with opprobrium by some media critics, who said it was irresponsible to make the information public without extensive vetting. BuzzFeed and Smith, the editor at the time, defended the decision, saying the public had a right to information that was circulating at the highest levels of power in Washington.
That same year, BuzzFeed News was sued by a Russian executive named in the dossier, who said the news organization had defamed him when it published its story. BuzzFeed won the lawsuit, and Smith said in an essay for The Atlantic on Thursday that he would make the same decision to publish again.
Newsroom employees had been told not to go into the office Thursday. Peretti held an all-hands video meeting after the announcement, with some members of management joining from a New York meeting room unfortunately named “Operation Doomsday,” according to a BuzzFeed staff member who was on the call and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.
Peretti told the workers that he had failed them, the staff member said. “It is clearly a massive failure on my part, and I am deeply sorry for it,” Peretti said in the meeting, according to the person.
Peretti was asked if he would resign, and he said he was staying on at the company.
“I own this decision,” he said, according to the person in the meeting. “Nothing that is happening today is about the work of this team.”
Karolina Waclawiak, the editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed News, told employees in an email Thursday that the newsroom had been making progress toward being profitable this year “only to be told — four months in — that we were out of time.”
A spokesperson for BuzzFeed said the company was planning to keep all of the stories published by the news division archived on its website in perpetuity.
BuzzFeed News signed off Thursday in the somewhat irreverent fashion it became known for over the last decade.
“BuzzFeed News is logging off with a reminder that Blippi pooped on his friend,” read an Apple News push alert from BuzzFeed, alluding to a story by the outlet about an actor who plays a character from a prominent children’s show.

Trading One Patagonia for Another: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The documentary "Wild Life" tells the story of Kristine Tompkins, a former chief executive who retired at 43 and moved to South America for love and conservation.
SANTA PAULA, Calif. -- Kristine McDivitt Tompkins's idea of sibling bonding is a monthlong trip to Antarctica on an icebreaker ship, including an icy dunk into the frigid waters of the Ross Sea, kayaking, hikes on icebergs and a lot of time analyzing maps.
"It's heaven down there," said Ms. Tompkins, the former chief executive of the outdoor-apparel company Patagonia. Sipping tea in her Southern California ranch home last week as her English Labrador, Finneaus, and her brother's Lab, Beto, strolled in and out of her living room, she recalled an expedition she took with her brother a few months earlier.
"Some people were really ready to get out," she said. "I could have turned and gone back the other way."
After her Antarctic sojourn, she headed to Chile and Argentina, working on conservation projects she and her husband had begun some three decades earlier. Ms. Tompkins, 72, has doubled down on those efforts in recent years, including meeting with Chile's president recently to discuss donating land for a new national park.
Ms. Tompkins is the subject of "Wild Life," a new documentary from Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, the Oscar-winning duo behind "Free Solo." The film tells the story of Ms. Tompkins and her husband, Doug Tompkins, a founder of the North Face and the apparel company Esprit, as well as the ambitious -- and controversial -- conservation projects they started after leaving their corporate careers behind.
In an interview, Ms. Tompkins said she was as committed as ever to her conservation efforts, helping her find purpose seven years after a deadly kayaking accident upended her life.
In a way, her life as an environmentalist began when Ms. Tompkins was a teenager in Southern California, where she befriended Yvon Chouinard; her family's beach house neighbored his. She started working in shipping at his climbing-equipment company, and, after college, she became one of the first six employees at a company he founded in 1973, Patagonia.
She had her fingerprints on many parts of the business, helping pick the typeface in the original logo, producing catalogs and heading imagery. Eventually, she rose to lead the company for years in the 1980s and 1990s.
Despite loving the work, she started to feel that something was missing.
"I was really kind of choking and sensing a kind of desperate need to figure out something else that would be as interesting and engaging as Patagonia," she said, adding, "Sometimes your body hangs there, but your heart is gone, your mind."
She ran into Mr. Tompkins, whom she had previously met. He had recently cashed out of his half of Esprit, reportedly for about $ 150 million, lamenting his role in the consumption-driven economy and wanting to focus on conservation.
For Ms. Tompkins, the encounter not only opened a door to a relationship but also shed light on her own search for a new mission.
"It was love immediately, but it was also, 'That's what I want to do,"' she recalled. "It was the light bulb. It was the flash."
As they grew closer, she took a plunge. At 43, she retired from Patagonia, joining Mr. Tompkins only days later on the farm he had moved to in southern Chile.
"I wanted an extreme life, and I mean really extreme, and I didn't know that that's what I was looking for and couldn't find on my own," she said. "But I think that's what I recognized in him."
Newlyweds Who Generated Suspicion
The couple were married in 1994, he at age 51, she at 44. The first years in their adopted home proved isolating and difficult as Ms. Tompkins found that she needed to improve her Spanish and that the rainy and cold conditions of Patagonia took some getting used to.
They focused on buying up parcels of land -- hundreds of thousands of acres at a time -- from which they removed livestock, fencing and invasive species in an effort to restore the land.
Their efforts were met with fierce local opposition and suspicion. Complaints ranged from criticisms that they were stunting development and disrupting the livelihoods of local farmers to more conspiratorial theories (Mr. Tompkins was accused of plotting to send the region's water to China or replace local cows with American bison). The couple, Mr. Tompkins especially, attracted a robust group of adversaries that included, at various times, Argentine and Chilean government figures, an energy company, the Catholic Church and the salmon industry.
"People were used to the idea of foreign corporations coming into Chile and buying land to exploit it," said Nadine Lehner, who served as executive director of one of the Tompkinses' organizations. "But the idea of coming in to conserve it was quite a new idea, and as such, I think, generated a lot of suspicion."
As they navigated their new marriage, they continued to pursue projects in Chile and Argentina and established an organization, Tompkins Conservation. Ms. Tompkins tapped into her managerial instincts, keeping projects moving while Mr. Tompkins set out an overall vision and occasionally grew fixated on the design of specific structures in the parks.
The relationship "worked in that he's a tough guy, but he respects it when you stand up to him -- and she's tough," Mr. Chouinard said. "And she stood up to him and he respected that, and it worked."
'I Wouldn't Let Him Go'
On Dec. 8, 2015, Mr. Tompkins was on a kayaking trip on General Carrera Lake, which straddles Chile and Argentina, with a group of friends, including Mr. Chouinard. Ms. Tompkins, who was several hours away by car, had discreetly given a member of the group a satellite phone, a device that Mr. Tompkins and Mr. Chouinard hated. After a while, emergency calls started to come in. Mr. Tompkins's kayak had capsized in windy conditions, and he had spent about an hour in the frigid water before being taken out.
When she found out, she crawled underneath the parked small plane he would often fly to explore the parks. "I wouldn't come out," Ms. Tompkins said, adding, "I didn't want any part of it."
Mr. Tompkins died before she reached the hospital.
"I just crawled up in his bed, and I wouldn't let him go," she said through tears, adding, "He was lucky to have lived that long, considering how he lived his life."
In her grief, Ms. Tompkins felt lost and unsure of how to proceed, but she ultimately decided to double down on her conservation efforts.
"Let's go for broke," she recalled thinking.
Carolina Morgado, the executive director of Rewilding Chile, which grew out of Tompkins Conservation, described her in that moment as a woman who "transformed her grief in power."
In 2018, Tompkins Conservation finalized a deal with the Chilean government in which the organization donated over a million acres of conservation land, with the government adding roughly nine million acres to create five new national parks and expand three. In total, the organization has created or expanded 15 national parks, protecting over 14 million acres in Argentina and Chile -- an initiative that continues. The organization and its offshoots have also taken up so-called rewilding efforts, reintroducing jaguars, red-and-green macaws, giant anteaters and other species.
For the husband-and-wife directors of "Wild Life," which opened in theaters on Friday and will come to Disney+ on May 26, Ms. Tompkins proved to be a compelling subject. (Mr. Chin and Ms. Vasarhelyi's previous documentaries covered the Thailand cave rescue and a climber's attempt to ascend Yosemite's El Capitan without a rope.)
"Climbing El Cap is really amazing, but what's more badass than saving the planet?" Mr. Chin said.
For Ms. Vasarhelyi, Ms. Tompkins's story is one of reinvention after profound loss.
"We made this film for our kids," Ms. Vasarhelyi said, adding, "While climate change may seem so big, while losing the love of your life may seem so big, step by step, effort by effort, you can address these things, we can do something."
But Ms. Tompkins calls herself cynical, saying she worries deeply about climate change. "On a good day, it's grief," she said. "On a bad day, it's despair." But she's not throwing in the towel, she said: "I'm going the other direction."
Ms. Tompkins is still involved with Patagonia, serving on its board and living near its headquarters. She even has thoughts on the evolution of Patagonia apparel into the de facto outfit for a certain variety of tech and finance worker. (Sometimes, the uglier a product, "the more heavily it would be sold into the business community," she recalled.)
Ms. Tompkins said that with her recent trip to Antarctica, as in her relationship with Mr. Tompkins and her conservation work, "what I still look for is this icy clarity and confrontation of extreme circumstances and harshness and difficulty. I think it makes me feel like I'm breathing."

Writers Guild Approves Strike as Shutdown Looms: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The writers have not gone on strike in 15 years, and the vote gives their unions the right to call for a walkout when their contract expires on May 1.
Hollywood is getting ever closer to a shutdown.
The unions representing thousands of television and movie writers said on Monday that they had overwhelming support for a strike, giving union leaders the right to call for a walkout when the writers' contract with the major Hollywood studios expires on May 1.
The unions, which are affiliated East and West Coast branches of the Writers Guild of America, said more than 9,000 writers had approved a strike authorization, with 98 percent of the vote.
W.G.A. leaders have said this is an "existential" moment for writers, contending that compensation has stagnated over the last decade despite the explosion of television series in the streaming era. In an email last week to writers, the lead negotiators said that "the survival of writing as a profession is at stake in this negotiation."
With two weeks to go before the contract expires, there has been little sign of progress in the talks. In the email, the negotiating committee said the studios "have failed to offer meaningful responses on the core economic issues" and offered only small concessions in a few areas.
"In short, the studios have shown no sign that they intend to address the problems our members are determined to fix in this negotiation," the email said.
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of Hollywood production companies, said in a statement that a strike authorization "should come as no surprise to anyone."
"A strike authorization vote has always been part of the W.G.A.'s plan, announced before the parties even exchanged proposals," the statement said. "Our goal is, and continues to be, to reach a fair and reasonable agreement." It added, "An agreement is only possible if the guild is committed to turning its focus to serious bargaining by engaging in full discussions of the issues with the companies and searching for reasonable compromises."
In recent weeks, Hollywood executives have begun preparing for a strike, both by stockpiling scripts and by getting ready to produce a torrent of reality series, which do not need script writers. David Zaslav, the chief executive of Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns the Warner Bros. film and TV studios as well as HBO, said at a news media event last week that he was hopeful a deal would be reached. He added that "a strike will be a challenge for the whole industry."
Still, he said, the company was fully prepared if there was a walkout.
"We're assuming the worst from a business perspective," he said. "We've got ourselves ready. We've had a lot of content that's been produced."
A strike authorization does not guarantee writers will take to the picket lines in two weeks. In 2017, a last-minute deal was struck with the studios not long after 96 percent of the writers voted to authorize a strike. The last time the writers went on strike was in 2007. That stoppage dragged for 100 days, into early 2008, and cost the Los Angeles economy an estimated $ 2.1 billion.
If a strike begins in early May, late-night shows like "Saturday Night Live" and talk shows hosted by Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel and Seth Meyers will go dark immediately. It would take a strike of several months before viewers began to notice an effect on scripted television series and movies.
The streaming era has resulted in a significant rise in the number of scripted television series that are produced, but writers say working conditions have not kept pace.
"Writers are working more weeks for less money," said Eric Haywood, a veteran writer and producer, and a member of the W.G.A. negotiating committee. "And in some cases, veteran writers are working for the same money or, in some cases, less money than they made just a few years ago."
The timing of the talks has an added complexity given the current financial challenges for all media and entertainment companies.
Over the last year, share prices for those companies have nose-dived after Wall Street began questioning why many streaming services were losing billions of dollars a year. The studios are quickly trying to make those streaming services profitable, after years of focusing primarily on growth. The shift is coming at a cost.
Disney is in the midst of 7,000 job cuts. Warner Bros. Discovery, confronting a debt load of about $ 50 billion, shelved projects and laid off thousands of workers last year. Other media companies are taking similar cost-cutting measures.
The writers do not appear to be sympathetic.
"The current status quo is unsustainable," Mr. Haywood said.
The writers have taken particular aim at so-called minirooms. There is no one definition of a miniroom, but they have proliferated in the streaming era.
In one example, the studios will convene a miniroom before a show has been picked up by a studio and scheduled to air. A small group of writers will develop a series and write several scripts over two or three months.
But because the studios have not ordered the series, they will use that as justification to pay writers less than if they were in a formal writers' room, union leaders said. And given the relatively short duration of the position, those writers are then left scrambling to find another job if the show is not picked up.
One union leader likened minirooms to "labor camps" during the negotiations, according to two people familiar with the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.
A W.G.A. spokesman said the reference was not literal and had come during a presentation lasting an hour and a half.
"Development work has always been paid at a premium because you're coming up with the idea," Ellen Stutzman, the chief negotiator for the W.G.A., said in an interview. "If you're going to have these rooms before you pick up a show or a season, you should pay writers a premium."
The writers have also said residuals -- which Ms. Stutzman called "the profit participation of the middle-class writer" -- have been affected in the streaming era. Before streaming, writers could receive residual payments whenever a show was licensed, whether that was for syndication, an international deal or DVD sales.
But in the streaming era, as global services like Netflix and Amazon have been reluctant to license their series, those distribution arms have been cut off and replaced with a fixed residual, Ms. Stutzman said.
"If an overwhelming majority of the content writers create is for the streaming platforms where they are completely cut out of global growth and success, that is a very big problem," she said.

LOS ANGELES — Hollywood is getting ever closer to a shutdown.
The unions representing thousands of television and movie writers said Monday that they had overwhelming support for a strike, giving union leaders the right to call for a walkout when the writers’ contract with the major Hollywood studios expires May 1.

Santos Received $5,300 in Donations, and Reports Refunding More: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mr. Santos, a first-year House Republican from New York, has returned nearly $ 8,400 in donations so far this year, and has reported no spending on lawyers or trips.
During George Santos's run for Congress, he told prospective voters that he hoped one day to be able to "serve and give back to our community."
In his most recent financial disclosures, Mr. Santos, now a first-term Republican congressman representing parts of Queens and Long Island, reported doing just that: He has returned nearly $ 8,400 in donor contributions.
The refunds exceed the $ 5,333.26 that Mr. Santos has raised in the first quarter of 2023, a net loss that lowers his cash on hand to just over $ 25,000, according to the reports filed on Saturday with the Federal Election Commission.
"I don't think I've ever seen a worse report for an incumbent member of Congress," said Brett Kappel, a leading elections lawyer who advises both Democrats and Republicans.
In contrast, Representative Anthony D'Esposito, a first-term Republican who represents a neighboring district in Nassau County, raised more than $ 215,000 from individual donors and more than $ 300,000 from political action committees.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Santos declined to comment on the fund-raising numbers.
Mr. Santos's filings are the first indication of his campaign's activity since he filed paperwork last month signaling his intent to continue raising money for a possible re-election bid. Though Mr. Santos has not publicly said whether he plans to run again, the move allows his campaign to keep raising and spending money.
But those hoping that the filings might offer a window into what exactly Mr. Santos has been doing since taking office in January will be largely disappointed. They show no campaign trips or payments to vendors. Nor do they show payments to any lawyers, despite continuing ethics and criminal investigations.
Mr. Santos has sought to blame his campaign finance issues, which prompted the watchdog group the Campaign Legal Center to file a complaint with the F.E.C., on his former campaign treasurer.
Subsequent filings, including the April quarterly filing, have been signed by his new treasurer, identified as Andrew Olson. But with no payments listed in reports, it would seem that he was not compensated by the campaign for whatever work he did for Mr. Santos.
Mr. Santos's previous treasurer, Nancy Marks, resigned in January, after The New York Times and other news media outlets reported on numerous financial irregularities -- from an odd string of payments for $ 199.99 to hundreds of thousands of dollars in unexplained and unitemized spending.
Of the $ 5,333.26 in recent donations to Mr. Santos, only one donation, for $ 254.95, came from a named donor: Sacha Basin, who listed a New York address. The donor could not be reached for comment. Some of the donors who received refunds were similarly not identified; those that were included Mayra Ruiz and Robert Mangi, whose contributions of $ 2,900 each were returned, and Thomas Zmich, a former House candidate who was refunded $ 500.
Mr. Zmich explained that the money had been for a bus trip to support Mr. Santos on the day of his inauguration; the trip was later canceled. When asked if he still supported the congressman, he was noncommittal: "I couldn't say yes and I couldn't say no."
Ms. Ruiz, a Republican donor in Miami, gave $ 10,800 to Mr. Santos's joint fund-raising committee, and was among the first to give Mr. Santos money after he won the election. She also was one of two wealthy donors who participated in the sale of a $ 19 million luxury yacht that was brokered by Mr. Santos.
Ms. Ruiz did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Mangi declined to comment.
Aside from public appearances -- a visit to show support for former President Donald J. Trump at his arraignment in Manhattan, several official tours and a handful of television shows and podcasts -- it has been hard to account for what Mr. Santos has been up to since taking office.
Ordinarily, House members' time is taken up by responsibilities related to their committee assignments. But Mr. Santos does not serve on any committees, having opted to resign from his postings at Speaker Kevin McCarthy's urging. Mr. Santos has introduced four bills, none of which have attracted co-sponsors.
But he has remained a vocal and emphatic presence online, where he has bragged about the value of a Cartier watch, decried the detention of a Wall Street Journal reporter in Russia and declared his loyalty to the New York Mets (albeit somewhat unpersuasively).
And he has spoken 18 times on the floor of the house -- the most of any freshman, according to the C-SPAN podcast "The Weekly." He has used the minute-long opportunities that House members are afforded for a broad spectrum of purposes, from disavowing the possibility of a new nuclear accord with Iran to congratulating Jericho High School on Long Island for being granted exclusive rights to put on a musical based on the Disney movie "Frozen."

The DeSantis Model: [Op-Ed]

Full text: Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida is in a trap of his own devising. His path to the Republican presidential nomination depends on convincing Donald Trump's base that he represents a more committed and disciplined version of the former president, that he shares their populist grievances and aims only to execute the Trump agenda with greater forcefulness and skill. But it also depends on convincing a G.O.P. elite grown weary of Mr. Trump's erratic bombast (not to mention electoral losses and legal jeopardy) that he, Mr. DeSantis, represents a more responsible alternative: shrewd where Mr. Trump is reckless; bookish where Mr. Trump is philistine; scrupulous, cunning and detail-oriented where Mr. Trump is impetuous and easily bored. In short, to the base, Mr. DeSantis must be more Trump than Trump, and to the donors, less.
Thus far, Mr. DeSantis has had greater success with party elites. By pairing aggressive stances on the culture wars with free-market economics and an appeal to his own competence and expertise, Mr. DeSantis has managed to corral key Republican megadonors, Murdoch media empire executives and conservative thought leaders from National Review to the Claremont Institute. He polls considerably higher than Mr. Trump with wealthy, college-educated, city- and suburb-dwelling Republicans. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, retains his grip on blue-collar, less educated and rural conservatives. For the G.O.P., the primary fight has begun to tell an all-too-familiar story: It's the elites vs. the rabble.
Mr. Trump, for his part, appears to have taken notice of this incipient class divide (and perhaps of the dearth of billionaires rushing to his aid). In the past few weeks, he has skewered Mr. DeSantis as a tool for "globalist" plutocrats and the Republican old guard. Since his indictment by a Manhattan grand jury, Mr. Trump has sought to further solidify his status as the indispensable people's champion, attacked on all sides by a conspiracy of liberal elites. While donors and operatives may prefer a more housebroken populism, it is Mr. Trump's surmise that large parts of the base still want the real thing, warts and all.
If his wager pays off, it will be a sign not just of his continued dominance over the Republican Party but also of something deeper: an ongoing revolt against "the best and brightest," the notion that only certain people, with certain talents, credentials and subject matter expertise, are capable of governing.
During his second inaugural speech in Tallahassee in January, Mr. DeSantis embraced the culture wars pugilism that has made him a Fox News favorite; he railed against "open borders," "identity essentialism," the "coddling" of criminals and "attacking" of law enforcement. "Florida," he reminded his audience, with a favored if clunky applause line, "is where woke goes to die!"
But the real focus -- as with his speech at the National Conservatism conference in Miami in September -- was on results (a word he repeated). Mr. DeSantis promised competent leadership; "sanity" and "liberty" were his motifs. For most of the speech, the governor sounded very much the Reaganite conservative from central casting. "We said we would ensure that Florida taxed lightly, regulated reasonably and spent conservatively," he said, "and we delivered."
In general, Mr. DeSantis's populism is heavy on cultural grievances and light on economic ones. The maneuvers that tend to endear him to the nationalist crowd -- flying a few dozen Venezuelan migrants from Texas to Martha's Vineyard, attempting to ban "critical race theory" at public colleges and retaliating against Disney for criticizing his "Don't Say Gay" bill -- are carefully calibrated to burnish his populist bona fides without unduly provoking G.O.P. elites who long for a return to relative conservative normalcy.
Indeed, Republican megadonors like the Koch family and the hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin appear to admire Mr. DeSantis in spite of the populist firebrand he periodically plays on TV. Mr. Griffin recently told Politico's Shia Kapos he aims, as Ms. Kapos described it, to "blunt" the populism that has turned some Republican politicians against the corporate world. Mr. Griffin gave $ 5 million to Mr. DeSantis's re-election campaign.
Mr. DeSantis's principal claim to being Mr. Trump's legitimate heir, perhaps, is his handling of the Covid pandemic in Florida. Mr. DeSantis depicts his decision to reopen the state and ban mask mandates as a bold move against technocrats and scientists, denizens of what he calls the "biomedical security state."
But his disdain for experts is selective. While deciding how to address the pandemic, Mr. DeSantis collaborated with the Stanford epidemiologist Jay Bhattacharya ("He'd read all the medical literature -- all of it, not just the abstracts," Dr. Bhattacharya told The New Yorker) and followed the recommendations of a group of epidemiologists from Stanford, Harvard and Oxford who pushed for a swifter reopening. Mr. DeSantis's preference for their recommendations over those of Dr. Anthony Fauci and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn't signify a rejection of expertise as such, only an embrace of alternative expertise. Mr. DeSantis wanted to save Florida's tourism economy, and he found experts who would advise him to do so.
In reality, Mr. DeSantis is not against elites, exactly; he aims merely to replace the current elite (in academia, corporations and government) with a more conservative one, with experts who have not been infected, as Mr. DeSantis likes to say, by "the woke mind virus." The goal is not to do away with the technocratic oligarchy, but to repopulate it -- with people like Ron DeSantis.
Earlier generations of American thinkers had higher aspirations. "The reign of specialized expertise," wrote the historian Christopher Lasch in 1994, "is the antithesis of democracy." In the 19th century, European visitors were impressed (and unnerved) to find even farmers and laborers devouring periodicals and participating in the debating societies of early America. The defining feature of America's democratic experiment, Mr. Lasch insisted, was "not the chance to rise in the social scale" but "the complete absence of a scale that clearly distinguished commoners from gentlemen."
Twentieth-century capitalism, Mr. Lasch thought, had resulted in a perilous maldistribution of intelligence and competence; experts had usurped governance, while the value of practical experience had plummeted.
Mr. Lasch briefly came into vogue among conservatives during the Trump years, but they never grasped his central claim: that generating equality of competence would require economic redistribution.
In his 2011 book, Mr. DeSantis railed against the "'leveling' spirit" that threatens to take hold in a republic, especially among the lower orders. His principal target in the book is "redistributive justice," by which he apparently means any effort at all to share the benefits of economic growth more equitably -- whether using government power to provide for the poor or to guarantee health care, higher wages or jobs.
The essential ingredients of his worldview remain the same. Mr. DeSantis has adopted a populist idiom, but he has no more sympathy now than he did 12 years ago for the "'leveling' spirit" -- the ethos of disdain for expertise that Mr. Trump embodied when he burst onto the national political stage in 2015. In fact, Mr. DeSantis's posture represents a bulwark against it: an effort to convince G.O.P. voters that their enemies are cultural elites, rather than economic ones; that their liberty is imperiled, not by the existence of an oligarchy but by the oligarchs' irksome cultural mores.
Mr. DeSantis has honed an agenda that attacks progressive orthodoxies where they are most likely to affect and annoy conservative elites: gay and trans inclusion in suburban schools, diversity and equity in corporate bureaucracies, Black studies in A.P. classes and universities. None of these issues have any appreciable impact on the opportunities afforded to working-class people. And yet conservative elites treat it as an article of faith that these issues will motivate the average Republican voter.
The conservative movement has staked its viability on the belief that Americans resent liberal elites because they're "woke" and not because they wield so much power over other people's lives. Their promise to replace the progressive elite with a conservative one -- with men like Ron DeSantis -- is premised on the idea that Americans are comfortable with the notion that only certain men are fit to rule.
Mr. Trump, despite what he sometimes represents, is no more likely than Mr. DeSantis to disrupt the American oligarchy. (As president, he largely let the plutocrats in his cabinet run the country.)
Few politicians on either side appear eager to unleash -- rather than contain -- America's leveling spirit, to give every American the means and not merely the right to rule themselves.
To break through the elite standoff that is our culture war, politicians must resist the urge to designate a single leader or group of leaders, distinguished by their brilliance, to shoulder the hard work of making America great. It would mean taking seriously a proverb frequently quoted by Barack Obama but hardly embodied by his presidency: "We are the ones we've been waiting for." It would also mean, to quote a line from the Scottish essayist Thomas Carlyle favored by Mr. Lasch, that the goal of our republic -- of any republic -- should be to build "a whole world of heroes."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: TAIPEI, Taiwan -- I just returned from visiting China for the first time since Covid struck. Being back in Beijing was a reminder of my first rule of journalism: If you don't go, you don't know. Relations between our two countries have soured so badly, so quickly, and have so reduced our points of contact -- very few American reporters are left in China, and our leaders are barely talking -- that we're now like two giant gorillas looking at each other through a pinhole. Nothing good will come from this.
The recent visit by Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-wen, to the United States -- which prompted Beijing to hold live-fire drills off Taiwan's coast and to warn anew that peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are incompatible with any move by Taiwan toward formal independence -- was just the latest reminder of how overheated this atmosphere is. The smallest misstep by either side could ignite a U.S.-China war that would make Ukraine look like a neighborhood dust-up.
That's one of the many reasons I found it helpful to be back in Beijing and to be able to observe China again through a larger aperture than a pinhole. Attending the China Development Forum -- Beijing's very useful annual gathering of local and global business leaders, senior Chinese officials, retired diplomats and a few local and Western journalists -- reminded me of some powerful old truths and exposed me to some eye-popping new realities about what's really eating away at U.S.-China relations.
Hint: The new, new thing has a lot to do with the increasingly important role that trust, and its absence, plays in international relations, now that so many goods and services that the United States and China sell to one another are digital, and therefore dual use -- meaning they can be both a weapon and a tool. Just when trust has become more important than ever between the U.S. and China, it also has become scarcer than ever. Bad trend.
More personally, being back in Beijing was also a reminder of how many people I've come to know and like there over three decades of reporting visits -- but please don't tell anyone in Washington that I said that. There's something of a competition today between Democrats and Republicans over who can speak most harshly about China. Truth be told, both countries have so demonized the other of late that it is easy to forget how much we have in common as people. I can't think of any major nation after the United States with more of a Protestant work ethic and naturally capitalist population than China.
Being back was also a reminder of the formidable weight and strength of what China has built since opening to the world in the 1970s, and even since Covid hit in 2019. China's Communist Party government has a stronger grip than ever on its society, thanks to its police state surveillance and digital tracking systems: Facial recognition cameras are everywhere. The party crushes any challenge to its rule or to President Xi Jinping. These days, it is extremely difficult for a visiting columnist to get anyone -- a senior official or a Starbucks barista -- to speak on the record. It was not that way a decade ago.
That said, one should have no illusions: The Communist Party's hold is also a product of all the hard work and savings of the Chinese people, which have enabled the party and the state to build world-class infrastructure and public goods that make life for China's middle and lower classes steadily better.
Beijing and Shanghai, in particular, have become very livable cities, with the air pollution largely erased and lots of new, walkable green spaces. As my Times colleague Keith Bradsher reported in 2021, Shanghai had recently built 55 new parks, bringing its total to 406, and had plans for nearly 600 more.
Bradsher, one of the handful of American reporters who lived in mainland China through nearly three years of stringent "zero Covid" policies, also pointed out to me that some 900 cities and towns in China are now served by high-speed rail, which makes travel to even remote communities incredibly cheap, easy and comfortable. In the last 23 years America has built exactly one sort-of-high-speed rail line, the Acela, serving 15 stops between Washington, D.C., and Boston. Think about that: 900 to 15.
I say this not to argue that high-speed trains are better than freedom. I say this to explain that being in Beijing reminds you that China's stability is a product of both an increasingly pervasive police state and a government that has steadily raised standards of living. It's a regime that takes both absolute control and relentless nation-building seriously.
For an American to fly from New York's Kennedy Airport into Beijing Capital International Airport today is to fly from an overcrowded bus terminal to a Disney-like Tomorrowland. It makes me weep for all the time we have wasted these past eight years talking about a faux nation builder named Donald Trump.
On my first day in Beijing, I had a conversation with a young Chinese woman, a college student. Her first question, alluding to a book I wrote, was: "Mr. Friedman, is the world still flat?"
I explained why I thought it was flatter than ever by my definition -- that because of steady advances in connectivity and digitization, more people can compete, connect and collaborate on more things for less money from more places than ever. During my time in Beijing, I was struck at how educated Chinese people seem to be more connected, and able to get around digital firewalls, than before.
I could see the woman wasn't totally convinced by my explanation, so we moved on to other subjects. And then she dropped this: "I just used ChatGPT."
I said, "You used ChatGPT from Beijing, and you're asking me if the world is still flat?"
Indeed, a story making the rounds in Beijing is that many Chinese have begun using ChatGPT to do their ideology homework for the local Communist Party cell, so they don't have to waste time on it.
It's funny, though -- just when you start to worry about the state of J.F.K. Airport, and all the stories in recent years that China was going to bury us in the race to A.I., an American team, OpenAI, comes up with the world's leading natural language processing tool, which enables any user to have humanlike conversations, ask any question and get deep insights in every major language, including Mandarin.
China got an early jump on A.I. in two realms -- facial recognition technology and health records -- because there are virtually no privacy restrictions on the government's ability to build huge data sets for machine learning algorithms to find patterns.
But generative A.I., like ChatGPT, gives anyone, from a poor farmer to a college professor, the power to ask any question on any subject in his or her own language. This could be a real problem for China, because it will have to build many guardrails into its own generative A.I. systems to limit what Chinese citizens can ask and what the computer can answer. If you can't ask whatever you want, including what happened in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, and if your A.I. system is always trying to figure out what to censor, where to censor and whom to censor, it will be less productive.
"ChatGPT is prompting some people to ask if the U.S. is rising again, like in the 1990s," Dingding Chen, a Chinese political scientist, told me and Bradsher.
It's for all of these reasons that weighing the shifting power relationship between America and China has become such a popular pastime among elites in both of our countries. For instance, through social media, many Chinese got to see parts of the March 23rd hearing on Capitol Hill where members of Congress questioned -- or, actually, berated, harangued and constantly interrupted -- TikTok's chief executive, Shou Chew, claiming TikTok's videos were damaging American children's mental health.
Hu Xijin, one of China's most popular bloggers, with almost 25 million followers on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, explained to me just how insulting Chinese found that hearing. It was widely and derisively commented about online in China.
(All that said, YouTube has been banned from China since 2009, so we're not the only ones frightened by popular apps. I say we trade: We'll accept TikTok if Beijing will let in YouTube.)
"I understand your feeling: You have been in the first place for a century, and now China is rising, and we have the potential to become the first -- and that is not easy for you," Hu said to me. But "you should not try to stop China's development. You can't contain China in the end. We are quite smart. And very diligent. We work very hard. And we have 1.4 billion people."
Before the Trump presidency, he added: "We never thought China-U.S. relations would ever become so bad. Now we gradually accept the situation, and most Chinese people think there is no hope for better relations. We think the relationship will be worse and worse and hope that war will not break out between our two countries."
It was repeated conversations like these that got me started asking American, Chinese and Taiwanese investors, analysts and officials a question that has been nagging at me for a while: What exactly are America and China fighting about?
A lot of people hesitated when I asked. Indeed, many would answer with some version of "I'm not sure, I just know that it's THEIR fault."
I'm pretty sure I'd get the same answer in Washington.
The best part of this trip was uncovering the real answer to that question and why it stumps so many people. It's because the real answer is so much deeper and more complex than just the usual one-word response -- "Taiwan" -- or the usual three-word response -- "autocracy versus democracy."
Let me try to peel back the layers. The erosion in U.S.-China relations is a result of something old and obvious -- a traditional great-power rivalry between an incumbent power (us) and a rising power (China) -- but with lots of new twists that are not always visible to the naked eye.
The old and obvious aspect is that China and America are jostling to acquire the most economic and military clout to shape the rules of the 21st century in ways most advantageous to their respective economic and political systems. And one of those disputed rules, which America has acknowledged but not endorsed, is China's claim to Taiwan as part of "One China."
Because that "rule" remains in dispute, we will continue to arm Taiwan to deter Beijing from seizing the island, crushing its democracy and using it as a jumping off point to dominate the rest of East Asia, and China will keep pushing for reunification -- one way or another.
One of the twists, though, is that this standard-issue great-power rivalry is occurring between nations that have become as economically intertwined as the strands of a DNA molecule. As a result, neither China nor America has ever had a rival quite like the other.
America knew how to deal with Nazi Germany, an economic and military peer, but a country with which we were not deeply economically intertwined. America knew how to deal with the Soviet Union, a military peer but nowhere near our economic peer, and a country with which we were not economically intertwined at all.
Ditto China. For several thousand years China saw itself as situated in the middle of the world -- hence it referred to itself as Zhong Guo, the Middle Kingdom -- protected by mountains, deserts and seas on all sides, and often dominating states around it, while fiercely preserving its own culture. That was until the 19th century, when it began to be repeatedly ravaged by stronger foreign powers: Britain, France, Russia and Japan.
But in modern times, China, like America, has never had to deal with a true economic and military peer with which it was also totally intertwined through trade and investment.
How intertwined? Americans' favorite device is an iPhone assembled mostly in China, and until recently the favored foreign destination of Chinese college students -- some 300,000 of them today -- is America. That makes for some weird scenes, like watching one country shoot down another country's intelligence balloon just after the two countries in 2022 set a record in annual bilateral trade.
Another new twist, and a reason it's hard to define exactly what we're fighting about, has a lot to do with how this elusive issue of trust and the absence of it have suddenly assumed much greater importance in international affairs.
This is a byproduct of our new technological ecosystem in which more and more devices and services that we both use and trade are driven by microchips and software, and connected through data centers in the cloud and high-speed internet. When so many more products or services became digitized and connected, so many more things became "dual use." That is, technologies that can easily be converted from civilian tools to military weapons, or vice versa.
In the Cold War it was relatively easy to say that this fighter jet is a weapon and that that phone is a tool. But when we install the ability to sense, digitize, connect, process, learn, share and act into more and more things -- from your GPS-enabled phone to your car to your toaster to your favorite app -- they all become dual use, either weapons or tools depending on who controls the software running them and who owns the data that they spin off.
Today, it's just a few lines of code that separate autonomous cars from autonomous weapons. And, as we've seen in Ukraine, a smartphone can be used by Grandma to call the grandkids or to call a Ukrainian rocket-launching unit and give it the GPS coordinates of a Russian tank in her backyard.
This, too, leads to more weird twists. I am thinking of how a number of U.S. armed forces branches have banned TikTok from government-issued smartphones and computers. This is surely the first time that the Pentagon has banned an app that is known mostly for sharing dance moves. But there is a real fear that TikTok's highly addictive algorithm is dual use and could be repurposed by the Chinese intelligence service to amass data on our youth -- more than 150 million Americans have downloaded the app, the company says -- to scramble their brains, spread disinformation or collect information that could one day be used for blackmail.
And the twists just keep on coming. For the first 30 or so years after Beijing opened up to trading with the world, starting around 1978-79, China largely sold America what I call "shallow" goods -- shoes, socks, shirts and solar panels.
Meanwhile, America and the West tended to sell China what I call "deep goods" -- goods that went deep into their systems and were dual use -- namely software, microchips, bandwidth, smartphones and robots. China had to buy our deep goods because, until relatively recently, it could not make many itself.
As long as most of what China sold us was shallow goods, we did not care as much about its political system -- doubly so because it seemed for a while as if China was slowly but steadily becoming more and more integrated with the world and slightly more open and transparent every year. So, it was both easy and convenient to set aside some of our worries about the dark sides of its political system.
But then, about eight years ago, we got a knock on our door and there was a Chinese salesman. He said: "Hi, my name is Mr. Huawei and I make 5G telephone equipment better than anything you have. I'm starting to install it all over the world, and I'd like to wire America."
What America essentially told this Huawei salesman, as well as other rising Chinese high-tech firms, was this: "When Chinese companies were just selling us shallow goods, we didn't care if your political system was authoritarian, libertarian or vegetarian; we were just buying your shallow goods. But when you want to sell us 'deep goods' -- goods that are dual use and will go deep into our homes, bedrooms, industries, chatbots and urban infrastructure -- we don't have enough trust to buy them. So, we are going to ban Huawei and instead pay more to buy our 5G telecom systems from Scandinavian companies we do trust: Ericsson and Nokia."
The role of trust in international relations and commerce took one more great leap for another reason: As more and more products and services became digitized and electrified, the microchips that powered everything became the new oil. What crude oil was to powering 19th- and 20th-century economies, microchips are for powering 21st-century economies.
So today, the country or countries that can make the fastest, most powerful and most energy efficient microchips can make the biggest A.I. computers and dominate in economics and military affairs.
But here's the rub: Because the physics of making advanced logic chips has become so complex -- a human hair is about 90,000 nanometers thick and the world's best mass producer of advanced chips in the world is now making three-nanometer transistors -- no one country or company can own the whole supply chain. You need the best from everywhere, and that supply chain is so tightly intertwined that each company has to trust the others intimately.
China doesn't need to look far for that lesson. It is on display right across the Straits of Taiwan, at the world's greatest chip-making company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, better known as TSMC.
After I left Beijing, I came to Taiwan, where I spent an afternoon with the leaders of TSMC at their headquarters in Hsinchu Science Park, a 90-minute drive south of Taipei, the capital. When you ask them what is the secret that enables TSMC to make 90 percent of the world's most advanced logic chips -- while China, which speaks the same language and shares the same recent cultural history, makes zero -- their answer is simple: "trust."
TSMC is a semiconductor foundry, meaning it takes the designs of the most advanced computer companies in the world -- Apple, Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD and others -- and turns the designs into chips that perform different processing functions. In doing so, TSMC makes two solemn oaths to its customers: TSMC will never compete against them by designing its own chips and it will never share the designs of one of its customers with another.
"Our business is to serve multiple competitive clients," Kevin Zhang, senior vice president for business development at TSMC, explained to me. "We are committed not to compete with any of them, and internally our people who serve customer A will never leak their information to customer C."
But by working with so many trusted partners, TSMC leverages the partners' steadily more complex designs to make itself better -- and the better it gets, the more advanced designs it can master for its customers. This not only requires incredibly tight collaboration between TSMC and its customers, but also between TSMC and its roughly 1,000 critical local and global suppliers.
"Our customers are very demanding," added Zhang. "Their products each have unique requirements." They each "tell us what they want to do, and together we figure out how TSMC will design the process to make it." As the physics of chip making gets more and more extreme, "the investment from customers is getting bigger and bigger, so they have to work with us more closely to make sure they harvest as much [computing power] as they can. They have to trust you."
China also has a foundry, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, which is partly state-owned. But guess what? Because no global chip designers trust SMIC with their most advanced designs, it is at least a decade behind TSMC.
It's for these reasons that the erosion in U.S.-China relations goes beyond our increasingly sharp disagreements over Taiwan. It is rooted in the fact that just when trust, and its absence, became much bigger factors in international affairs and commerce, China changed its trajectory. It made itself a less trusted partner right when the most important technology for the 21st century -- semiconductors -- required unprecedented degrees of trust to manufacture and more and more devices and services became deep and dual use.
Why did China lose our trust?
After the period of China's isolation and internal turmoil under Mao Zedong ended with his death in 1976, a successor, Deng Xiaoping, made a 180-degree turn away from Maoism. Deng established a much more collective leadership for China and term limits for the top leaders, and he put pragmatism -- whatever would drive economic growth -- above Communist ideology, while hiding China's growing strength.
In the era of Deng and his successors -- in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s -- Beijing forged strong economic and educational ties with the United States, which ushered China into the World Trade Organization, on the condition that China gradually phase out its mercantilist practice of funding state-owned industries and that it gradually open itself to more foreign investment and ownership, much as the world opened itself to China's exports.
But after Xi Jinping took over as China's paramount leader in 2012, he seemed to be alarmed at how China's openness toward the world, its consensus approach to leadership and its rush down a semi-capitalist path had led to runaway corruption inside both the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, to a degree that was hurting the party's legitimacy.
So Xi centralized power into his own hands, crushed all the fiefs that had been created by different leaders of different government agencies and sectors of the economy, re-injected the authority of the Communist Party into every corner of business, academia and society and deployed pervasive surveillance technologies. All together, this reversed what seemed like China's steady march toward more openness -- and even a somewhat freer press.
Xi also basically shifted away from Deng's unabashed unleashing of the private sector, focusing instead on building national economic champions that could dominate all the key industries of the 21st century -- from A.I. to quantum computing to aerospace -- and making sure Communist Party cells were in their management and in their work forces. And when American trade officials said: "Hey, you need to live up to your W.T.O. commitments to restrict state-funding of industries," China basically said: "Why should we live by your interpretation of the rules? We are now big enough to make our own interpretations. We're too big; you're too late."
Combined with China's failure to come clean on what it knew about the origins of Covid-19, its crackdown on democratic freedoms in Hong Kong and on the Uyghur Muslim minority in Xinjiang, its aggressive moves to lay claim to the South China Sea, its increasing saber rattling toward Taiwan, its cozying up to Vladimir Putin (despite his savaging of Ukraine), Xi's moves toward making himself president for life, his kneecapping of China's own tech entrepreneurs, his tighter restrictions on speech and the occasional abduction of a leading Chinese businessman -- all of these added up to one very big thing: Whatever trust that China had built up with the West since the late 1970s evaporated at the exact moment in history when trust, and shared values, became more important than ever in a world of deep, dual-use products driven by software, connectivity and microchips.
As that happened, it started to matter a lot more to Western nations generally and the United States in particular that this rising power -- which we were now selling to or buying from all sorts of dual-use digital devices or apps -- was authoritarian.
Beijing, for its part, argues that as China became a stronger global competitor to America -- in deep goods like Huawei 5G -- the United States simply could not handle it and decided to use its control over advanced semiconductor manufacturing and other high-tech exports from America, as well as from our allies, to ensure China always remained in our rearview mirror. So Beijing came up with a new strategy, called "dual circulation." It said: We will use state-led investments to make everything we possibly can at home, to become independent of the world. And we will use our manufacturing prowess to make the world dependent on our exports.
Chinese officials also argue that a lot of American politicians -- led by Trump but echoed by many in Congress -- suddenly seemed to find it very convenient to put the blame for economic troubles in the U.S.'s middle class not on any educational deficiencies, or a poor work ethic, or automation or the 2008 looting by financial elites, and the crisis that followed, but on China's exports to the United States. As Beijing sees it, China not only became America's go-to boogeyman, but in their frenzy to blame Beijing for everything, members of Congress started to more recklessly promote Taiwan's independence.
A senior administration official told me that Xi told President Biden at their summit in Bali in November, in essence: I will not be the president of China who loses Taiwan. If you force my hand, there will be war. You don't understand how important this is to the Chinese people. You're playing with fire.
Nevertheless, it's clear to me that at some level Chinese officials now understand that, as a result of their own aggressive actions in recent years on all the fronts I've listed, they have frightened both the world and their own innovators at precisely the wrong time.
I say that because of how often senior Chinese officials tell every foreign leader and visiting Western business executive they meet today that China is "open" and eager for foreign investment. The reality is, it has to be more open to foreign direct investment because China's provinces desperately need capital to compensate for all the money each local government spent controlling Covid and because many of them are running out of land to sell for state-owned factories to raise money.
I also don't think it was an accident of timing that Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba and sort of the Steve Jobs of China, suddenly reappeared a few weeks ago in state-controlled media after having suddenly disappeared from public view in 2020. Ma had vanished after a disagreement with state regulators, who thought he was getting too big and independent. His disappearance sent shock waves through China's start-up community and curbed investments.
I have no problem saying that I would like to live in a world where the Chinese people are thriving, alongside all others. After all, we are talking about more than one out of six people on the planet. I don't buy the argument that we are destined for war. I believe that we are doomed to compete with each other, doomed to cooperate with each other and doomed to find some way to balance the two. Otherwise we are both going to have a very bad 21st century.
I have to say, though, Americans and Chinese remind me of Israelis and Palestinians in one respect: They are both expert at aggravating the other's deepest insecurities.
China's Communist Party is now convinced that America wants to bring it down, which some U.S. politicians are actually no longer shy about suggesting. So, Beijing is ready to crawl into bed with Putin, a war criminal, if that is what it takes to keep the Americans at bay.
Americans are now worried that Communist China, which got rich by taking advantage of a global market shaped by American rules, will use its newfound market power to unilaterally change those rules entirely to its advantage. So we've decided to focus our waning strength vis-à-vis Beijing on ensuring the Chinese will always be a decade behind us on microchips.
I don't know what is sufficient to reverse these trends, but I think I know what is necessary.
If it is not the goal of U.S. foreign policy to topple the Communist regime in China, the United States needs to make that crystal clear, because I found a lot more people than ever before in Beijing think otherwise.
And by the way, in today's fused world, the notion that China can economically collapse and America still thrive is utter fantasy. And the notion that the Europeans will always be with us in such an endeavor, given the size of China's market, may also be fanciful. Note French President Emmanuel Macron's bowing and scraping in Beijing last week.
As for China, it can tell itself all it wants that it has not taken a U-turn in recent years. But no one is buying it. China will never realize its full potential -- in a hyper-connected, digitized, deep, dual-use, semiconductor-powered world -- unless it understands that establishing and maintaining trust is now the single most important competitive advantage any country or company can have. And Beijing is failing in that endeavor.
In his splendid biography of the great American statesman George Shultz, Philip Taubman quotes one of Shultz's cardinal rules of diplomacy and life: "Trust is the coin of the realm."
Never has that been truer than today, and never has China been more in need of embracing that truth.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A new coalition, organized by the Broadway League, has formed to defeat a casino proposal backed by Caesars and Jay-Z.
Some New Yorkers may love Times Square; some definitely hate it. That also goes for a casino that may be headed there.
Caesars Entertainment and SL Green Realty Corporation, New York City's largest commercial landlord, say that Times Square -- with its neon lights and jostling tourists -- is tailor-made for their Jay-Z-backed bid for a parlor of one-armed bandits and roulette wheels.
Via their "Coalition for a Better Times Square," they have enlisted dozens of local supporters, including roughly a dozen restaurants in the area; two hotel chains with properties nearby; several unions, including the Actors' Equity Association and Local 802, which represents Broadway musicians; two local stores; and a handful of landlords.
But Max Klimavicius, the owner of the century-old Sardi's restaurant, would like a word.
"A casino in Times Square has the potential to jeopardize the character of the theater district and ultimately the fate of its restaurants," Mr. Klimavicius said. "Casinos are designed to keep the gamblers inside. They have their own restaurants."
Sardi's is part of a new coalition, organized by the Broadway League, that is designed to defeat the casino proposal. The group, called the No Times Square Casino Community Coalition, also includes two restaurants and a bar founded by Joe Allen, as well as a Times Square church, five residents associations, a bus association and a youth travel association.
Opposition to the project is to be expected: Protests have greeted proposals for casinos next to Citi Field in Queens, at the Nassau Coliseum in Long Island and by the boardwalk in Coney Island, Brooklyn.
But because New York has fashioned a siting process that is heavily reliant on community input, any opposition may hold disproportionate weight. The approvals gantlet includes a six-person, site-specific community advisory committee, made up of representatives of local elected officials. A two-thirds majority of support is required for a proposal to move forward.
Liz Krueger, the state senator whose district encompasses Times Square and who has a vote on that committee, appears to be a no. "I'm still waiting for one human being who lives in my district who doesn't work for one of the casino companies bidding or the P.R. companies working for them to tell me that they really, really think that a casino is a great idea," she said. "I think it's a terrible idea."
The Broadway League, a trade association that represents theater owners and producers, agrees, suggesting that a casino would harm the neighborhood's character and draw people away from the theaters that are so essential to New York City's tourist economy, which is only now getting back onto its feet.
"We believe it challenges the cultural significance and the unique character that Broadway has delivered for New York for such a long time," Charlotte St. Martin, the Broadway League's president, said. "Obviously, we are just coming back and getting healthy, and we believe that a casino will damage that character and damage attendance."
This is hardly a David and Goliath battle pitting grass-roots opposition against a corporate behemoth; both sides have plenty of capital and influence.
The Broadway League's board includes Thomas Schumacher, the head of Disney Theatrical Group, whose Lion King musical runs at the Minskoff Theater -- directly at the base of the SL Green skyscraper at 1515 Broadway where the casino is planned.
Mr. Schumacher declined to comment for this story.
Five of the league's board members work for the Shubert Organization, Broadway's biggest theater owner, whose headquarters and 17 Broadway theaters are all close to the proposed casino.
A spokesman for the Shubert Organization declined to make one of its leaders available for an interview.
The No Times Square Casino Community Coalition includes the Manhattan Plaza Tenants Association, which represents residents at the 1,700-unit complex two blocks west of the Theater District. A large proportion of the residents are professional artists.
As it happens, the owner of that property, Related Companies, is also bidding to build a Manhattan casino, in its case over the rail yards on the Far West Side where it has promised to build a school and affordable housing.
Aleta LaFargue, the tenant association president, said the tenants voted to oppose the Times Square casino, and she opposes both. For Ms. LaFargue, it is personal. Gambling addiction afflicted her great-grandfather and her great-uncle, who spends his money on slot machines and is about to lose his house, she said.
Ms. LaFargue was speaking from Margate, N.J., where her mother grew up, just outside of Atlantic City -- many opponents' Exhibit A as to why they do not want casinos in urban areas. She lives in Hell's Kitchen, where she says drug abuse and street crime have risen in recent years.
"We're really working to try to turn that around, and I think that bringing in a casino might be the worst thing we could ever do," she said.
Ken Sturm, the owner of Bacall's Family Steakhouse just down the street from Sardi's, did not share the views of Ms. LaFargue or Mr. Klimavicius, whose concerns he dismissed as "stupid."
"It's a big shot in the arm for New York City to have it in Midtown at this convenient location, versus Queens or Yonkers or some nonsense like that," sad Mr. Sturm, whose five-year-old restaurant has been struggling to recover from the pandemic.
In 2022, New York State approved the issuance of up to three downstate casino licenses. At least eight proposals have been floated, with the region's two existing racinos -- horse tracks with electronic casino-styled games -- potentially holding an edge. One of those is at the Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens; the other is in Yonkers, just north of the city.
Casinos are a divisive economic development strategy. Elected officials have a habit of overstating the projected tax benefits of casinos, and their economic impact often wanes over time.
"There's always pretty significant divided opinion, with social advocates arguing for the problems associated with all the social harms, and economic advocates arguing that they're losing money to neighboring states," said Robert Williams, a coordinator at the Alberta Gambling Research Institute. "It's the same story over and over again."
For decades, those concerned with the social harms associated with gambling tended to win the day, he said. But in recent years, Mr. Williams has noted a change, as the casino industry has become a "juggernaut," he said.
"It tends to be the casino proponents that are winning these days," Mr. Williams said.

"We believe it challenges the cultural significance and the unique character that Broadway has delivered for New York for such a long time," Ms. St. Martin said.

Full text: A new show at the Wild Project in Manhattan imagines how a small 1950s community weathers the arrival of the mass media age.
In "Television," which opened Wednesday in a Thirdwing production at the Wild Project, the playwright and director Cameron Darwin Bossert once again zeros in on America's most sprawling form of soft power: its homegrown media. It's an uneven production, but one that continues Bossert's examination of the clash between the country's cozy self-image and its greedier actions.
Here, he imagines what happens to a small Colorado town in the late 1950s once its local TV station loses its CBS affiliation. As with his previous diptych, "A Venomous Color" -- a pair of plays, "Burbank" and "The Fairest," about the labor conditions during the early years of Disney's animation studio -- he is interested in the small, midcentury moments when mass media quietly lost its innocence.
With "Television," Bossert reaches for a more epic canvas: wider and wholly fictionalized, like the ongoing soap operas that populated the era's airwaves. But, over a period of just over two hours, he slowly loses his focus, and the piece overflows with expanding motivations and plotlines.
The action begins quickly, at least, with Wesley (Arash Mokhtar), the owner of the ailing station, meeting a neighboring family, the Fitzwaters, and taking an interest in their son, Billy (Cian Genaro). Soon headed off to study psychology in Denver, of which his veteran father, Arnold (Dikran Tulaine), disapproves, Billy has been passing the time writing conveniently episode-length plays whose nuanced mundanity Wesley thinks would make great counterprogramming to the overwrought offerings, like "Gunsmoke" and "Johnny Staccato," currently crowding the broadcast schedule.
Along with his colleague Barry (Bobby Underwood), Wesley begins producing the kid's scripts, which, starring the dreadfully serious actress Sandra (Aprella Godfrey Barule), become a regional sensation. Soon enough, the independent network starts looking to fill up their programming schedule, and mother Fitzwater (Mary Monahan) gears up to host her own cooking show.
Success, naturally, takes its toll on everyone. Taking on issues as macro as shell-shock, imperialism and media saturation, and as intimate as the particular sins of the Fitzwater father, Bossert struggles to maintain his usual precision. He rushes through and doesn't sketch the piece's many characters thoroughly enough for us to be really invested.
But they are all compelling threads, drawn intelligently from modern American legends -- there is more than a little of Paddy Chayefsky's "Network" here, especially regarding Lionel (Wesli Spencer), an affable mailman who slowly begins to lose it after being plucked to host a talk show.
Bossert's acuity for matter-of-fact dialogue, and directing it tensely, is still incredibly engaging, initially coming across as jarring before revealing the lively emotion behind it; the air in his plays is not dead, but rather dense. It's underscored by Deeba Montazeri's sparsely deployed sound design, whose melancholy piano is immediately reminiscent of golden age melodrama, and nicely serves Bossert's larger intentions of compounding the personal and historical.
"Television" might not rise above the sensory overload it seeks to address, but still shows Bossert as a keen observer of the origins of our current media landscape.

California Stung As Vital Sectors Suffer Setbacks: [National Desk]

Full text: As recession fears persist, the troubles in major industries have hurt tax revenues, turning the state's $ 100 billion surplus into a deficit.
California has often been at the country's economic forefront. Now, as fears of a national recession continue to nag, the state is hoping not to lead the way there.
While the California economy maintains its powerhouse status, outranking even those of most countries, the state's most-powerful sectors -- including tech companies and supply chain logistics -- have struggled to keep their footing, pummeled by high interest rates, investor skittishness, labor strife and other turmoil.
Even the weather hasn't cooperated. Severe flooding throughout much of the winter, caused by atmospheric rivers, has left farming communities in the Central Valley devastated, causing hundreds of millions of dollars in crop losses.
Thousands of Californians have been laid off in the last few months, the cost of living is increasingly astronomical, and Gov. Gavin Newsom revealed in January that the state faced a $ 22.5 billion deficit in the 2023-24 fiscal year -- a plummet from the $ 100 billion surplus a year ago.
"It's an EKG," Mr. Newsom said at the time, comparing a graph of the state's revenue to the sharp spikes and drops of the heart's electrical activity. "That sums up California's tax structure. It sums up the boom-bust."
The structure, which relies in large part on taxing the incomes of the wealthiest Californians, often translates into dips when Silicon Valley and Wall Street are uneasy, as they are now. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, one of the state's most prominent corporations, said in January that it was cutting 12,000 workers worldwide, and Silicon Valley Bank, a key lender to tech start-ups, collapsed last month, sending the federal government scrambling to limit the fallout.
This has coincided with a drop in venture capital funding as rising interest rates and recession fears have led investors to become more risk-averse. That money, which declined 36 percent globally from 2021 to 2022, according to the management consulting firm Bain & Company, is critical to Silicon Valley's ability to create jobs.
"The tech sector is the workhorse of the state's economy, it's the backbone," said Sung Won Sohn, a finance and economics professor at Loyola Marymount University. "These are high earners who might not be able to carry the state as much as they did in the past."
Entertainment, another pillar of California's economy, has also been in retreat as studios adjust to new viewing habits. Disney, based in Burbank, announced in February that it would eliminate 7,000 jobs worldwide.
In California alone, employment in the information sector, a category that includes technology and entertainment workers, declined by more than 16,000 from November to February, according to the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics data, which predates a recent wave of job cuts in March.
A recent survey from the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California found widespread pessimism about the economy. Two-thirds of respondents said they expected bad economic times for the state in the next year, and a solid majority -- 62 percent -- said they felt the state was already in a recession.
When Mr. Newsom announced the deficit earlier in the year, he vowed not to dip into the state's $ 37 billion in reserves, and instead called for pauses in funding for child care and reduced funding for climate change initiatives.
Joe Stephenshaw, director of the California Department of Finance, said in an interview that he and top economists had begun to spot points of concern -- persistent inflation, higher interest rates and a turbulent stock market -- on the state's horizon during the second half of last year.
"Those risks became realities," said Mr. Stephenshaw, an appointee of the governor.
He acknowledged that the problem was driven largely by declines in high earners' incomes, including from market-based compensation, such as stock options and bonus payments. As activity slowed, he said, interest rates rose and stock prices fell.
But the state's problems aren't limited to the tech industry.
California's robust supply chain, which drives nearly a third of the state's economy, has continued to buckle under stresses from the pandemic and an ongoing labor fight between longshoremen and port operators up and down the West Coast, which has prompted many shipping companies to rely instead on ports along the Gulf and East Coasts. Cargo processing at the Port of Los Angeles, a key entry point for shipments from Asia, was down 43 percent in February, compared with the year before.
"The longer it drags on, the more cargo will be diverted," said Geraldine Knatz, a professor of the practice of policy and engineering at the University of Southern California, who was executive director of the Port of Los Angeles from 2006 to 2014.
Still, wherever the economic cycle is leading, California heads into it with some strengths. Although unemployment in February, at 4.3 percent, was higher than in most states, it was lower than the rate a year earlier. In the San Francisco and San Jose metropolitan areas, unemployment was below 3.5 percent, better than the national average.
Over decades, California's economy has historically seen the highest of highs and the lowest of lows, part of the state's boom-bust history. During the recession of the early 1990s, largely driven by cuts to aerospace after the end of the Cold War, California was hit much harder than other parts of the country.
In March, the U.C.L.A. Anderson Forecast, which provides economic analysis, released projections for both the nation and California, pointing to two possible scenarios -- one in which a recession is avoided and another in which it occurs toward the end of this year.
"Even in our recession scenario we have a mild recession," said Jerry Nickelsburg, director of the Anderson Forecast.
Regardless of which scenario pans out, California's economy is likely to be better off than the national one, according to the report, which cited increased demand for software and defense goods, areas in which California is a leader. Mr. Nickelsburg also said the state's rainy-day fund was healthy enough to withstand the decline in tax revenues.
But that shortfall could complicate the speed at which Mr. Newsom can carry out some of his ambitious, progressive policies. In announcing the deficit, Mr. Newsom scaled back funding for climate proposals to $ 48 billion, from $ 54 billion.
The fiscal outlook also casts a cloud over progressive proposals, widely supported by Democrats, who have a supermajority in the Legislature.
A state panel that has been debating reparations for Black Californians is set to release its final report by midyear. Economists have projected that reparations could cost $ 800 billion to compensate for overpolicing, housing discrimination and disproportionate incarceration rates. Once the panel releases its report, it will be up to lawmakers in Sacramento to decide how much state revenue would support reparations -- a concept that Mr. Newsom has endorsed.
Through all this, one thing has remained constant: Many Californians say their biggest economic concern is housing costs.
The median value for a single-family home in California is about $ 719,000 -- up nearly 1 percent from last year, according to Zillow -- and recent census data shows that some of the state's biggest metro areas, including Los Angeles and San Francisco Counties, have continued to shrink. (In Texas, where many Californians have relocated, the median home value is about $ 289,000.)
Still, some Californians remain optimistic.
Zeeshan Haque, a former software engineer at Google, learned in January that he was being laid off. His last day was March 31.
"It was out of nowhere and very abrupt," said Mr. Haque, 32, who recently moved from the Bay Area to Los Angeles.
He bought a $ 740,000 house in the city's Chatsworth neighborhood in February and spent time focusing on renovations. But in recent weeks, he has begun to look for a new job. He recently updated his LinkedIn avatar to show the hashtag #opentowork and said he hoped to land a new job soon.
"It's just very competitive at this time because of so many layoffs," he said.

When Celebrities Sling Mud, It's Fertile Soil for Drama: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A dramatization of the trial between the wives of two soccer stars is returning to the West End in London, joining TV shows, podcasts and documentaries about the high-profile spat.
With its stage transformed into a green soccer pitch, "Vardy v. Rooney: The Wagatha Christie Trial" at Wyndham's Theater in London last November promised its nearly sold-out audience a game, and the two women onstage were both trying to score a goal.
But as two pundits ooh'ed and aah'ed from the sidelines, the actresses sparring were not playing soccer stars but the women married to them, caught at the center of an Instagram feud turned high-profile libel case that captured the British public's attention last May and peeled back the curtain hiding the machinations of British celebrity and the glitzy world of English soccer.
"I see it as a comedy of manners," said Liv Hennessy, the writer of the play, which returns to the West End on Thursday at the Ambassadors Theater. "It's a theatrical way for us to look at the way people behave in our current society."
The play is just one recent retelling of the real-life case that became known as the "Wagatha Christie" trial, in which Rebekah Vardy, the wife of the Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy, sued Coleen Rooney, the wife of the former Manchester United star Wayne Rooney, for defamation. The catalyst: Rooney's accusation, on Twitter, that Vardy had leaked her personal information to the British press.
The wives and girlfriends of soccer players -- commonly known in Britain by the acronym WAGs -- have long been followed by tabloids, but Rooney's post caused an online furor. Its escalation into the legal realm led to breathless coverage, drawing in powerhouse lawyers and unearthing revelations about both women's personal lives.
The legal side of the long-running saga came to an end last July, with the High Court ruling against Vardy, saying that the reputational damage from the scandal was not libel and ordering Vardy to pay almost all of Rooney's legal costs, which amounted to about £1.7 million, or $ 1.9 million.
But the case's power as a story has lived on, with production companies, documentary makers, podcasters and journalists finding the unfolding trial and its cast of characters just too irresistible not to dissect, all helped by the availability of the weeklong case's court transcripts.
"It's the old adage of: You can't write this," said Thomas Popay, the creative director of Chalkboard TV, which produced a two-part dramatization, "Vardy v. Rooney: A Courtroom Drama," that aired on Channel 4 in Britain last December. "We literally didn't. We took the transcripts and recreated them."
Alongside the West End play and Channel 4 show, offerings for followers of the feud include a BBC podcast called "It's ... Wagatha Christie" and the Discovery+ documentary "Vardy vs Rooney: The Wagatha Trial." Rooney has signed a Disney+ deal for a three-part documentary looking at the events leading up to the trial, and the saga is reportedly being considered for a retelling as part of the series "A Very British Scandal."
"All of us can relate to the idea of being betrayed -- especially betrayed by someone who we trusted," Popay said. "And on Vardy's side -- we can all relate to not being believed."
In her 2019 social media post, Rooney described how she concocted a sting operation to reveal the betrayer by posting false stories that were visible to a single account -- Vardy's -- to test if they would turn up in The Sun, a London tabloid.
The popularity of the post led to Rooney being nicknamed "Wagatha Christie" -- a portmanteau of WAG and Agatha Christie, the mystery writer -- for her detective work. Vardy quickly denied she was the leaker and sued Rooney for defaming her.
"We are absolutely interested in people's misfortunes and what goes on in celebrity lives," said Adrian Bingham, a professor of modern British history at the University of Sheffield who has studied media and gender issues. The women's involvement with the soccer world gave their dispute resonance with a wider audience, he added, while the legal case gave the non-tabloid media a legitimate reason to cover it. Producers of the adaptations say they have asked their own lawyers to look over scripts, lest they find themselves accused of defamation.
The court transcript itself had moments and revelations that many say were ripe for re-enactment: a phone with key evidence in the form of WhatsApp messages, apparently lost to the bottom of the North Sea; lawyers in wigs formally reading out text messages from the women, some containing profanities; Vardy's tears on the witness stand after cross-examination by David Sherborne, Rooney's lawyer.
"It was positively Shakespearean in terms of how it went down," said Popay. "We decided the best thing to do and the most accurate thing to do was to completely recreate the trial by using the court transcripts verbatim." His company's show, which was commissioned in May during the trial and aired in December, drew 1.5 million viewers.
Hennessy, the writer of the West End play, also relied heavily on the court transcripts, but took liberties by leaning into the soccer world, structuring the play like a game itself. Reading the transcripts, she said she was struck by the humanity of the two women, who have both been criticized (Vardy has said that people made abusive threats toward her and her unborn baby following that fateful post, while the trial laid bare tensions in Rooney's marriage and her experience growing up with fame).
"It does ask how complicit we are in creating public figures, and tearing them down when they don't meet our standards," Hennessy said.
Even at a rehearsal in late March, before the play's official return, it was clear the trial continued to intrigue and perplex even the cast members. During a pivotal scene in which Rooney is grilled by Vardy's lawyer on precisely why she made the fateful decision to share the feud with the world, the actors broke character to pose their own burning questions: Was that decision one of a calculating woman, or a woman at a breaking point? Why had she not privately confronted Vardy? And what did it feel like to live, as they imagined Rooney did, in a world where one's image could become a public commodity?
Though celebrity gossip can be easy to dismiss as frivolous, the two opponents in the trial were both women from working-class backgrounds who laid out one aspirational pathway for others like them, said Rebecca Twomey, an entertainment correspondent who has covered both women closely.
"We like to put people on pedestals -- and bring them down," she said, adding that many people enjoyed a modern-day pantomime. "You might think they're airhead WAGs, but these are two sharp, intelligent women."
Still, the enduring appeal of the high drama of "Wagatha Christie" is also simple, Professor Bingham said.
"The reason people are telling it is not because it's insightful," he added. "It's because it's a great story -- with great lines."

California Economy Is on Edge After Tech Layoffs and Studio Cutbacks

LOS ANGELES — California has often been at the country’s economic forefront. Now, as fears of a national recession continue to nag, the state is hoping not to lead the way there.
While the California economy maintains its powerhouse status, outranking even those of most countries, the state’s most-powerful sectors — including tech companies and supply chain logistics — have struggled to keep their footing, pummeled by high interest rates, investor skittishness, labor strife and other turmoil.
Even the weather hasn’t cooperated. Severe flooding throughout much of the winter, caused by atmospheric rivers, has left farming communities in the Central Valley devastated, causing hundreds of millions of dollars in crop losses.
Thousands of Californians have been laid off in the past few months, the cost of living is increasingly astronomical, and Gov. Gavin Newsom revealed in January that the state faced a $22.5 billion deficit in the 2023-24 fiscal year — a plummet from the $100 billion surplus a year ago.
“It’s an EKG,” Newsom said at the time, comparing a graph of the state’s revenue to the sharp spikes and drops of the heart’s electrical activity. “That sums up California’s tax structure. It sums up the boom-bust.”
The structure, which relies in large part on taxing the incomes of the wealthiest Californians, often translates into dips when Silicon Valley and Wall Street are uneasy, as they are now. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, one of the state’s most prominent corporations, said in January that it was cutting 12,000 workers worldwide, and Silicon Valley Bank, a key lender to tech startups, collapsed last month, sending the federal government scrambling to limit the fallout.
This has coincided with a drop in venture capital funding as rising interest rates and recession fears have led investors to become more risk-averse. That money, which declined 36% globally from 2021 to 2022, according to management consulting firm Bain & Co., is critical to Silicon Valley’s ability to create jobs.
“The tech sector is the workhorse of the state’s economy, it’s the backbone,” said Sung Won Sohn, a finance and economics professor at Loyola Marymount University. “These are high earners who might not be able to carry the state as much as they did in the past.”
Entertainment, another pillar of California’s economy, has also been in retreat as studios adjust to new viewing habits. The Walt Disney Co., based in Burbank, announced in February that it would eliminate 7,000 jobs worldwide.
In California alone, employment in the information sector, a category that includes technology and entertainment workers, declined by more than 16,000 from November to February, according to the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics data, which predates a recent wave of job cuts in March.
A recent survey from the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California found widespread pessimism about the economy. Two-thirds of respondents said they expected bad economic times for the state in the next year, and a solid majority — 62% — said they felt the state was already in a recession.
When Newsom announced the deficit earlier in the year, he vowed not to dip into the state’s $37 billion in reserves, and instead called for pauses in funding for child care and reduced funding for climate change initiatives.
Joe Stephenshaw, director of the California Department of Finance, said in an interview that he and top economists had begun to spot points of concern — persistent inflation, higher interest rates and a turbulent stock market — on the state’s horizon during the second half of last year.
“Those risks became realities,” said Stephenshaw, an appointee of the governor.
He acknowledged that the problem was driven largely by declines in high earners’ incomes, including from market-based compensation, such as stock options and bonus payments. As activity slowed, he said, interest rates rose and stock prices fell.
But the state’s problems aren’t limited to the tech industry.
California’s robust supply chain, which drives nearly one-third of the state’s economy, has continued to buckle under stresses from the pandemic and an ongoing labor fight between longshoremen and port operators up and down the West Coast, which has prompted many shipping companies to rely instead on ports along the Gulf and East coasts.

Although unemployment in February, at 4.3%, was higher than in most states, it was lower than the rate a year earlier.

Work a Few Days From the Office, Then Head Home to Be Laid Off: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: McDonald's temporarily closed its corporate offices this week so it could lay off workers virtually. Was that a good idea?
This week, McDonald's asked corporate employees, who usually work from the office at least three days a week, to do the job from home. The plan was to lay off hundreds of employees, DealBook hears, and the company preferred to deliver its news virtually.
McDonald's isn't the only company to tweak the layoff playbook. In January, Google laid off thousands via email. And Mark Zuckerberg, the C.E.O. of Meta, last month announced plans for a year of big cuts in a 2,000-word memo, explaining that Meta staff "wanted more transparency sooner into any restructuring plans."
Like many work norms, how to fire people is being rewritten in the wake of the pandemic, when downsizing companies often had little choice but to make layoffs via Slack, Zoom and email, and often did so sloppily. With offices open again, and remote work more common, companies now have options -- and it's not necessarily clear what is best for workers.
"If we had this conversation three years ago, I would have said this is cruel and unusual punishment," said Bob Sutton, a professor at Stanford and the author of "The No Asshole Rule," about remote firing. "But it's changed so dramatically since the pandemic that I'm confused."
The case for virtual layoffs. Cynthia Huang, a senior marketing manager, was laid off from a consumer goods company with a hybrid work policy in February. Because she was working remotely that day, she got the news via a video call; others were let go at the office.
Huang said she preferred getting the call at home. "It felt more comfortable than if I had to physically walk out of the office, have everyone watch me, get all my stuff," she said.
Laying off people at home may sometimes be more compassionate in the hybrid-work era, Sutton said. "If you call people into the office who don't go into the office very much to lay them off, it's kind of weird," he said.
The case for face-to-face firing. When layoffs are done remotely, managers may not fully feel the human cost of their decisions, Sutton said: It's "a little bit easy come, easy go." And with an in-person notice, workers have a chance to say goodbye to co-workers.
Kim Scott, a former Google executive and the author of "Radical Candor," suggested that awkwardness or embarrassment could be avoided by planning ahead -- for instance, having an extra conference room for people to collect themselves and an option to collect belongings after hours.
The medium matters. A video call with your manager beats the impersonal email. "It's very hard to care personally over email," Scott said.
And experts question the wisdom of Zuckerberg's pre-layoff announcement.
"You have to be prepared at the same time to talk to people about both the process that you're going to go through and what people will get offered if it turns out that their jobs are at risk," said Sandra Sucher, a professor at Harvard Business School. "Because if you don't do all the pieces of that at the same time, you're just introducing a ton of uncertainty into your organization."
Scott advises a tight window between announcing and executing layoffs. "That makes everybody feel nervous," she said of the Zuckerberg approach.
But even the most considerate version of letting someone go is still painful. "It just felt very like there wasn't that, like, human touch," Huang said about her experience. "But I don't think that was necessarily because it was virtual versus in person. I think it's just the nature of a layoff." -- Sarah Kessler
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Donald Trump pleaded not guilty to 34 low-level felonies. The charges of falsifying business records are all related to hush-money payments to the porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016. Even if convicted, Trump would not automatically be barred from running for president.
Job growth slowed in March. Employers added 236,000 jobs, the Labor Department reported on Friday, down from an average of 334,000 added over the prior six months. The gradual slowing appears to reflect the impact of rising interest rates, which is good news for President Biden.
Jamie Dimon discussed the banking crisis. In an interview with CNN, the JPMorgan Chase C.E.O. said turmoil caused by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank would make a recession more likely. "We are seeing people reduce lending a little bit, cut back a little bit and pull back a little bit," he said.
Credit Suisse's leaders mourned the end of their bank. At the Swiss bank's annual meeting on Tuesday, top officials acknowledged that it would be the last as the firm prepared to be absorbed by its archrival, UBS. Axel Lehmann, Credit Suisse's chairman, also apologized for the scandals and missteps that had led to the bank's demise -- but shareholder after shareholder bitterly attacked company leaders: "You can almost taste the feelings of distaste and betrayal here today," one investor said.
LIV Golf players teed off at the Masters Tournament for the first time. A strong showing would be a breakthrough for the league, which is bankrolled by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. The tournament is scheduled to conclude on Sunday, weather permitting.
What if the Twitter board had said 'no' to Elon Musk?
A year ago this week, Elon Musk revealed himself to be Twitter's largest shareholder. Shortly afterward, he signed a deal to acquire the company for $ 54.20 per share, kicking off months of drama and legal challenges that ended with Musk as the owner.
Since then, he has laid off thousands of workers, made changes that have caused some advertisers to flee and confused users by tinkering with the app, most recently by adding the Dogecoin logo to the site's home page and blocking the liking or sharing of tweets that contain links to Substack.
But what if the board had rejected the offer? It's impossible to know for sure, but let's play it out.
Twitter would have slashed costs anyway. Had his offer been rejected, Musk could have launched a hostile bid. But he also could have simply moved on to other things, cratering Twitter's stock by selling his shares. In either situation, the board would have been left with one clear task: Get Twitter's share price to $ 54.20 -- up from roughly $ 40 on the day before Musk revealed his stake. JPMorgan Chase had already done the math on the board's behalf, and wasn't confident that it was possible. Twitter would have had to streamline spending, and years of overhiring was a clear place to start. If the board hadn't accepted Musk's offer, it planned to announce significant layoffs at Twitter's quarterly results in April, a person familiar with the company's strategy told DealBook.
Ad revenue would have continued to decline. Major advertisers, facing economic uncertainty, have pulled back their spending on digital advertising, which constitutes 90 percent of Twitter's revenue. Even without Musk at the helm, Twitter's advertising "would have been decimated," said Rich Greenfield, an analyst who covered Twitter as a public company -- though, he added, "obviously not as bad as what has happened under Elon." Greenfield estimated that Twitter's shares would be worth $ 10 to $ 20 today.
Other activists may have pounced. If Twitter's share price dwindled drastically below Musk's offer price, it would have left Twitter vulnerable to activists pushing for a board shake-up, or for the ouster of Twitter's recently installed C.E.O., Parag Agrawal. (Musk fired him shortly after acquiring the company.) And they could have pushed for a sale. No real bidders stepped forward to challenge Musk's $ 54.20 offer, but if the stock price had halved over the next year, would a deal have emerged with Disney? Comcast's NBCUniversal? Apollo?
Any of those options would have most likely left shareholders shortchanged compared with Musk's offer. Society, some have argued, would have benefited. But that's not whom the board thought it reported to.

The Newsmaker: Ari Emanuel keeps doing deals
Within Hollywood, there are talent agents, and there are entertainment moguls. And then there is Ari Emanuel, the C.E.O. of Endeavor.
On Monday, Endeavor announced an agreement to buy World Wrestling Entertainment at a $ 9.3 billion valuation, the latest landmark deal in a decades-long career that has elevated Emanuel from a star agent to the chief gatekeeper for a broad array of content and talent.
Emanuel co-founded Endeavor in 1995, famously carrying out a late-night raid for his own office files at International Creative Management. (He is also, famously, the main inspiration for the foul-mouthed agent Ari Gold in "Entourage.")
He has steadily built up Endeavor with a series of deals: first acquiring the old-guard William Morris Agency, then later striking a deal to buy the IMG agency, which gave Endeavor both a sports agency and a foothold in live events. Just as consequentially, Endeavor bought both Professional Bull Riders and Ultimate Fighting Championship, the latter of which brought mixed martial arts to the masses.
Along the way, Emanuel has assembled an enviable Rolodex that includes Dwayne Johnson, Mark Wahlberg and Elon Musk (while maintaining a notoriously disciplined fitness regimen that reportedly includes daily ice baths and very restrictive diets).
Behind all that deal making is a bet on scale. Endeavor represents talent across books, movies, music, sports, television and theater; distributes and licenses content; and owns live events like M.M.A. matches.
Combining W.W.E. with U.F.C. is meant to create a live-event colossus, with viewing platforms paying handsomely to show the bouts. It will also make Emanuel the C.E.O. of not one but two publicly traded companies: Endeavor, valued at $ 7 billion, and the united U.F.C-W.W.E., which is valued at $ 21 billion and will be spun out.
"He's going back to the playbook," Brandon Ross, an analyst at LightShed Partners, told Bloomberg. "Ari likes to get bigger."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After more than three decades in and around politics, I now spend most of my time grappling with political questions in the classroom and in focus groups. There is one conundrum that fascinates me above others: Why does Donald Trump still generate such loyalty and devotion? And unlike 2016, can a different Republican win the nomination in 2024 who largely shares Mr. Trump's agenda but not his personality?
To answer these questions, I have hosted more than two dozen focus groups with Trump voters across the country, the most recent for Straight Arrow News on Wednesday night to understand their mind-sets in the aftermath of his historic indictment in Manhattan. Many felt ignored and forgotten by the professional political class before Mr. Trump, and victimized and ridiculed for liking him now. Like Republican primary voters nationwide, the focus group participants still respect him, most still believe in him, a majority think the 2020 election was stolen, and half still want him to run again in 2024.
But there is a way forward for other Republican presidential contenders as well.
It begins by reflecting more closely on Mr. Trump's rule-breaking, paradigm-shattering campaign in 2016 and all of his unforced errors since then. It accurately reflects the significant attitudinal and economic changes in America over the past eight years. And it requires an acceptance that pummeling him and attempting to decimate his base will not work. Trump voters are paying laserlike attention to all the candidates. If they think a candidate's mission is to defeat their hero, the candidate will fail. But if a 2024 contender convinces them that he or she wants to listen to and learn from them, they'll give that person a chance. Neither Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz understood this dynamic when they attacked Mr. Trump in 2016, and that's why they failed.
So consider this a playbook for potential Republican candidates and for G.O.P. voters and conservative independents wanting someone other than Mr. Trump in 2024, a strategic road map based on informed experiences with Trump voters for the past eight years. This is what I've learned from these focus groups and research.
First, beating Mr. Trump requires humility. It starts by recognizing that you can't win every voter. You can't win even half of them: Mr. Trump's support within the Republican Party isn't just a mile wide, it's also a mile deep. But based on my focus groups since 2015, roughly a third of Trump voters prioritize the character of the country and the people who run it -- and that's enough to change the 2024 outcome. It's not about beating Mr. Trump with a competing ideology. It's about offering Republicans the contrast they seek: a candidate who champions Mr. Trump's agenda but with decency, civility and a commitment to personal responsibility and accountability.
Second, Mr. Trump has become his own version of the much-hated political establishment. Mar-a-Lago has become Grand Central Terminal for politicians, political hacks, lobbyists, and out-of-touch elites who have ignored, forgotten and betrayed the people they represent. Worse yet, with incessant fund-raising, often targeting people who can least afford to give, Mr. Trump has become a professional politician reflecting the political system he was elected to destroy. For more than seven years, he has used the same lines, the same rallies, the same jokes and the same chants. That's perfectly fine for some Trump voters. But there's a clear way to appeal to other Republican voters firmly focused on the future rather than on re-litigating the past. It starts with a simple campaign pitch along these lines: "We can do better. We must do better."
Third, recognize that the average farmer, small business owner and veteran will hold greater sway with the Trump voter than the famous and the powerful. Having endorsements or campaign ads from members of Congress will generate less support than the emotional stories of people who, just like so many Trump supporters, were knocked down, got back up and are now helping others to do the same. They just need to be authentic -- and be able to say that they have voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 and 2020 -- so the Never Trump label won't stick. Their best message: the Trump of today is not the Trump of 2015. In other words: "Donald Trump had my back in 2016. Now, it's all about him. I didn't leave Donald Trump. He left me."
Fourth, compliment Mr. Trump's presidency while you criticize the person. Trump focus groups are incredibly instructive in helping differentiate between the passionate support most Trump voters feel for his efforts and his accomplishments and the embarrassment and frustration they have with his comments and his behavior. For example, most Republicans like his tough talk on China, but they dislike his bullying behavior here at home. So applaud the administration before you criticize the man. "Donald Trump was a great president, but he wasn't always a great role model. Today, more than ever, we need character -- not just courage. We don't need to insult people to make a point, or make a difference."
Fifth, make it more about the grandchildren. Millions of Trump voters are old -- really old. They love their grandchildren, so speak specifically about the grandkids and their grandparents will listen as well. "We mistake loud for leadership, condemnation for commitment. The values we teach our children should be the values we see in our president."
The looming debt ceiling vote is the perfect hook. The increase in the annual deficit under Trump ranks as the third-largest increase, relative to the size of the economy, of any U.S. presidential administration. Long before Covid, Republicans in Congress were told by the Trump White House to spend more -- and that spending contributed to the current debt crisis. Mr. Trump will say he was fiscally responsible, but the actual numbers don't lie. "We can't afford these deficits. We can't afford this debt. We can't afford Donald Trump."
Sixth, there's one character trait that unites just about everyone: an aversion to public piety while displaying private dishonesty. In a word, hypocrisy. Until now, that hasn't worked for Trump's opponents, but that's because the examples weren't personally relevant to Mr. Trump's voters. During his 2016 campaign, Trump condemned Barack Obama repeatedly for his occasional rounds of golf, promising not to travel at taxpayer expense. What was Trump's record? Close to 300 rounds of golf on his own personal courses in just four years, costing hardworking taxpayers roughly $ 150 million in additional security. This may sound minor, but delivered on the debate stage, it could be lethal. "While more than half of America was working paycheck to paycheck, he was working on his short game. And you paid for it!"
Seventh, you won't be elected with Republicans alone. The successful candidate must appeal to independents as well. In 2016, Mr. Trump promised his voters that they would get tired of winning. But he alienated independents to such a degree that they abandoned Republicans and joined Democrats, giving America Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2018, President Biden in 2020, and Majority Leader Schumer in 2020. Just one Senate seat in 2020 would have brought the Democratic agenda to a complete halt. Most of Mr. Trump's endorsements in highly contested races in 2022 lost in a midterms surprise that few people (including me) anticipated. If Mr. Trump is the nominee in 2024, are Republicans fully confident he will win independents this time? The ex-president surely loses if Republicans come to believe that a vote for Mr. Trump in the primaries means the election of Mr. Biden in the general.
And eighth, you need to penetrate the conservative echo chamber. You need at least one of these on your side: Mark Levin, Dennis Prager, Ben Shapiro, Newt Gingrich and, of course, Tucker, Hannity or Laura. Thanks to the Dominion lawsuit, we all know what Fox News hosts say in private. The challenge is to get them to be as honest in public. That requires a candidate as tough as Mr. Trump, but more committed publicly to traditional conservative ideology like ending wasteful Washington spending -- and the ability to get it done. "Some people want to make a statement. I want to make a difference."
Among the likely Republican rivals to Mr. Trump for the nomination, no one is coming close yet to doing some or all of this. Ron DeSantis has only mildly criticized Mr. Trump, preferring an all-out assault on Disney instead. No worries. He has plenty of time to get his messaging in order. But when he and his colleagues step onto the Republican debate stage in August, they will have but one opportunity to prove they deserve the job by proving they understand the Trump voter.
To be clear, if Mr. Trump runs exclusively on his administration's record, he probably wins the nomination. So far, he has proved himself incapable of doing so. Most Republicans applaud his economic and foreign policy successes and his impact on the bureaucracy and judiciary, particularly in comparison to his predecessor and now his successor.
But that's not the Donald Trump of 2023. The cheerleading stops for many when asked to evaluate Mr. Trump's ongoing public comments and behavior. In 2016, the campaign was about what he could do for you. Today, it's about what is being done to him. If he becomes increasingly unhinged, or if his opponents focus on his tweets, his outbursts and his destructive personality, a sizable number of Republicans could choose someone else, as long as they prioritize core, time-tested priorities like lower taxes, less regulation, and less Washington.
Republicans want just about everything Mr. Trump did, without everything Mr. Trump is or says.

Their Romance Took a While to Develop: [Society Desk]

Full text: It took Samantha Weinstein and Philip Della Noce a few years to form a friendship, and another few more to become romantic.
Some people know instantly when they meet "the one." But when Samantha Rose Weinstein met Philip Joseph Della Noce, "It was not love at first sight," she said. "We weren't too fond of each other at the beginning."
The two met Aug. 26, 2010 at Wagner College in Staten Island, N.Y., on their first day of freshmen orientation.
"It was definitely a slow burn," Ms. Weinstein, 30, said. "When you first meet me, I'm very loud, and he's very soft-spoken. So, I was probably too much for him." Indeed, Mr. Della Noce said he found her "a little intimidating." They gravitated toward different social groups, and saw each other in classes and theater activities, but it wasn't until junior year that the two became friends.
"We took a trip to Amsterdam with school," Ms. Weinstein said. "The whole group became closer, including us. And by our senior year we were very close."
In the spring of their final year, Mr. Della Noce, now 31, contracted mononucleosis. "I was dating someone else at the time, but the first person I went to was Sam," he said.
The two say they can't pinpoint an exact first date. "It was more a gradual development," said Ms. Weinstein, who admits she was the first to have romantic feelings. "Starting in September 2014, we were in a kind of gray area. It took Phil longer to come around."
In November 2014, Mr. Della Noce received an offer to work as a performer aboard the Disney Fantasy cruise ship. On Jan. 19, 2015, he left to rehearse for six weeks in Toronto.
Ms. Weinstein was sure their budding romance was doomed. But she needn't have worried; Mr. Della Noce continuously reached out.
"I got to Toronto, and the first person I called was Samantha," Mr. Della Noce said. "We FaceTimed every single day."
On Feb. 28, Ms. Weinstein took a 13-hour bus ride from Manhattan to see him and told him, "I think I'm starting to fall for you." He replied the same.
The two were on FaceTime on March 7, 2015, as he was on his way to board the ship for six months. "Which was when he said 'I love you' for the first time," Ms. Weinstein said. They spoke whenever Mr. Della Noce was in port. And when Ms. Weinstein went to join him onboard for a week in June 2015, Mr. Della Noce asked her to be his girlfriend.
Mr. Della Noce moved back to the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan in November 2015. About a year later, he moved to Hudson Heights, where Ms. Weinstein joined him in June 2017 and they still live today.
"We've been through long distance and quarantining through Covid in a one-bedroom," Ms. Weinstein said. So, they knew it was love.
Ms. Weinstein, who was raised in New City, N.Y., is a real estate agent and the director of operations for the Kelly Robinson team at Compass. She graduated in May 2014 from Wagner College with a bachelor's degree in musical theater performance, as did Mr. Della Noce.

Mr. Della Noce, who grew up primarily in the Philadelphia area, is a senior data analyst at the Situation Group. He has an M.B.A. from Syracuse University.
On June 1, 2021, under the guise of getting together for a friend's birthday, Mr. Della Noce proposed in Fort Tryon Park.
The park is very special to the couple. They live nearby and have walked it hundreds of times. Ms. Weinstein said, "We had so many talks in that park about getting married one day and our future together."
The couple were wed March 25 at the Park Savoy Estate in Florham Park, N.J. Because Ms. Weinstein is Jewish and Mr. Della Noce is Catholic, they had the Rev. Bill Beute, an assistant chaplain at Valley Forge Military Academy and College in Pennsylvania, officiate, with Rabbi Dennis Tobin of Chavurah Temple Beth El of Co-Op City in the Bronx participating in the interfaith ceremony.
The couple requested that all 140 guests be vaccinated and encouraged Covid tests before attending.
The melding of traditions and inclusion of their families in the ceremony was a great success, although Mr. Della Noce was not particularly fond of one reception tradition: being lifted up in the air in a chair during the hora. Mr. Della Noce said, "I was hora-fied."

After Marvel Blockbuster, Indigenous Actress Holds Fast to Maya Roots

SANTA MARÍA DE JESÚS, Guatemala — For her big underwater scene in “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” Guatemalan actress María Mercedes Coroy had to hold her breath as her character, Princess Fen, gives birth in a hazy ocean world to a winged serpent son.
She emerges from the watery depths as a rarity even in Marvel’s fantastical universe: a female Maya superhero.
The day after filming her final scene in Los Angeles, Coroy, rather than hanging out in Hollywood, headed home to Santa María de Jesús, a Kaqchikel Maya town of about 22,000 at the base of a volcano in Guatemala. By nightfall, she was curled up in bed in her family’s bright-pink cinder-block house with vegetables growing in the backyard.
“I felt like my bed was hugging me,” said Coroy, 28, one of nine siblings in a family of farmers and vendors.
The next morning, she resumed her usual life. She and her mother put on their handwoven huipiles, or blouses, and cortes, or skirts, to catch the 5:30 bus to the small city of Escuintla to sell produce in the bustling market, a job she started after fifth grade when she had to drop out of school to help her parents.
Some days, she walks two hours with a mule to the family farm to cultivate cabbage and pumpkins. In her spare time, she weaves colorful huipiles with motifs of birds and flowers on a backstrap loom.
“People ask me what I do after filming,” said Coroy, who is working on her third Guatemalan movie after appearing in two in the United States. “I go back to normal.”
Coroy represents a new generation of Maya actors determined to hone their craft while holding onto their customs and helping expose a legacy of discrimination against Guatemala’s Indigenous population.
Although she said she enjoys acting in the United States — and posing in a pink-and-blue huipil at the 2021 Golden Globe Awards — she is more interested in her own country’s burgeoning film industry.
But whether she’s working in her homeland or Hollywood, acting can be draining, and she relies on Santa María de Jesús to recharge her.
“I love my life, but filming is physically demanding,” Coroy said, relaxing on a bench in Santa María’s central park. “This is my community.”
Coroy’s first role was the lead in a school play production of “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Santa María de Jesus has long been locally famous for its street theater, and a decade ago, Guatemalan director Jayro Bustamante came to town to prepare for his first feature film, “Ixcanul” (“Volcano”). He wanted to tell a story of Maya women that addressed issues such as endemic poverty and inequities in education and health care, and he was determined to cast Maya actors speaking the Indigenous language of Kaqchikel.
Bustamante initially put up a sign in the town’s central park: “Casting Here.” No one showed up. A few days later he posted: “Work Here.” He was overwhelmed with prospective actors.
Coroy missed the audition. But a friend put her in touch with the director the next day.
“He told me I was the only person who looked him in the eye,” she said. When he offered her the lead, she balked. “I had no experience. I was afraid I would ruin the movie.”
But he persuaded her to join the cast. For the next several months, they trained at the country’s first film academy, founded by Bustamente.
“When we began filming, they were no longer amateur actors,” Bustamente said.
“Ixcanul,” which won the Alfred Bauer Prize at the 65th Berlin International Film Festival, focuses on a poor family in the mountains that arranges for the daughter to marry a plantation overseer. The daughter secretly gets involved with a young man — a drunk and a dreamer — who promises to take her with him to the United States. But he leaves without her and she finds herself pregnant while still engaged to the other man.
After she gives birth in a hospital, a staff member tells her that her baby has died. When the young woman finds out later that her child had lived and had possibly been sold for adoption, grief consumes her.
“Quiet and fearless,” Los Angeles-based film critic Manuel Betancourt wrote of Coroy’s understated performance, which revealed anguish behind a still face.
“I mouthed the words I was feeling in my head,” Coroy said, explaining her acting method. “It was easier then because I was naturally timid. I’m much more animated now.”
Her second film with Bustamante, “La Llorona,” transformed a traditional Latin American ghost story into an indictment of a fictional dictator, but one clearly reminiscent of the Guatemalan leader, Gen. Efraín Ríos Montt. Five years before his death in 2018, Ríos Montt was found guilty of genocide and crimes against humanity for the systematic slaughter of Maya men, women and children in the 1980s after he took control of the country in a coup.
Coroy plays Alma, a Maya housemaid whose son and daughter were among those murdered. A spectral figure in white, she haunts the dictator in his home.
A casting director saw her in the two Bustamante films and picked her for the part of an Indigenous guerrilla in “Bel Canto,” an American film starring Julianne Moore. For 2 1/2 months, Coroy filmed in Mexico and the United States, the longest she had ever been away from her family. She froze in New York, she said, and didn’t like the food.
She prefers not to discuss politics. But Bustamante said artists in Guatemala worked in an increasingly hostile climate.
“You realize you’re in a country where there is a dictatorship without that name,” Bustamante wrote in an email interview. “There is a murky sort of oppression and no rights or freedom.”
When “Ixcanul” was released, he wrote, “there was a general rejection by the Guatemalan people of this sort of subject matter. With ‘La Llorona,’ it was much more dangerous. We received anonymous threats.”
“Wakanda Forever,” a global blockbuster distributed by Disney, also addresses the oppression of the Maya.
Coroy’s character, Princess Fen, catches smallpox brought by the Spaniards to the Yucatán Peninsula in the 16th century. A shaman gives her a drink that allows her to live and give birth underwater. When her winged son, Namor, played by Mexican actor Tenoch Huerta, returns to the Yucatán, he sees Spaniards beating the Maya they have enslaved.
In Guatemala, some Maya families encourage their children to speak only Spanish and wear Western clothing to escape ongoing rampant discrimination. But that’s not how Coroy was raised.
“My parents tell me I should be proud,” said Coroy, who eventually returned to night school and finished college. “There is no way that you can hide that you’re Indigenous.”
She has recently begun delving into Maya spirituality. Her grandmother was a natural healer who taught her about the curative properties or herbal teas and flowers. Although she worships in a Catholic church, she also studies with an Indigenous spiritual teacher and reads the Maya creation story, the Popol Vuh.
Central to Maya religion is Maximón, a trickster deity both benevolent and hedonistic. In ceremonies, adherents smoke and drink in front of his wooden figure in the hopes he will hear their entreaties. Coroy attends ceremonies without imbibing, she said.
“I respect Maximón,” she said. “I have connected with him in dreams. He said, ‘You neither speak well of me nor poorly, so I will protect you.’”
Although she’s famous enough in Guatemala that people in the colonial tourist city of Antigua, a UNESCO World heritage site, approach her politely for autographs, her neighbors in Santa María avoid singling her out. Walking in the town’s park, she might as well be any other vendor.
“There’s no movie star culture here,” Coroy said. “There are no paparazzi.”

Full text: After filming her part in "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever," María Mercedes Coroy returned to her "normal" life of farming and trading in a Guatemalan town at the base of a volcano.
SANTA MARÍA DE JESÚS, Guatemala -- For her big underwater scene in "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever," the Guatemalan actress María Mercedes Coroy had to hold her breath as her character, Princess Fen, gives birth in a hazy ocean world to a winged serpent son.
She emerges from the watery depths as a rarity even in Marvel's fantastical universe: a female Maya superhero.
The day after filming her final scene in Los Angeles, Ms. Coroy, rather than hanging out in Hollywood, headed home to Santa María de Jesús, a Kaqchikel Maya town of about 22,000 at the base of a volcano in Guatemala. By nightfall, she was curled up in bed in her family's bright pink cinder block house with vegetables growing in the backyard.
"I felt like my bed was hugging me," said Ms. Coroy, 28, one of nine siblings in a family of farmers and vendors.
The next morning she resumed her usual life. She and her mother put on their hand-woven huipiles, or blouses, and cortes, or skirts, to catch the 5:30 bus to the small city of Escuintla to sell produce in the bustling market, a job she started after fifth grade when she had to drop out of school to help her parents.
Some days she walks two hours with a mule to the family farm to cultivate cabbage and pumpkins. In her spare time, she weaves colorful huipiles with motifs of birds and flowers on a backstrap loom.
"People ask me what I do after filming," said Ms. Coroy, who is working on her third Guatemalan movie after appearing in two in the United States. "I go back to normal."
Ms. Coroy represents a new generation of Maya actors determined to hone their craft while holding onto their customs and helping expose a legacy of discrimination against Guatemala's Indigenous population.
While she said she enjoys acting in the United States -- and posing in a pink and blue huipil at the 2021 Golden Globe Awards -- she is more interested in her own country's burgeoning film industry.
But whether she's working in her homeland or Hollywood, acting can be draining, and she relies on Santa María de Jesús to recharge her.
"I love my life, but filming is physically demanding," Ms. Coroy said, relaxing on a bench in Santa María's central park. "This is my community."
Ms. Coroy's first role was the lead in a school play production of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Santa María de Jesus has long been locally famous for its street theater, and a decade ago, the Guatemalan director Jayro Bustamante came to the town to prepare for his first feature film, "Ixcanul" ("Volcano"). He wanted to tell a story of Maya women that addressed issues like endemic poverty and inequities in education and health care, and he was determined to cast Maya actors speaking the Indigenous language of Kaqchikel.
Mr. Bustamante initially put up a sign in the town's central park: Casting Here. No one showed up. A few days later he posted: Work Here. He was overwhelmed with prospective actors.
Ms. Coroy missed the audition. But a friend put her in touch with the director the next day.
"He told me I was the only person who looked him in the eye," she said. When he offered her the lead, she balked. "I had no experience. I was afraid I would ruin the movie."
But he convinced her to join the cast. For the next several months, they trained at the country's first film academy, founded by Mr. Bustamente.
"When we began filming, they were no longer amateur actors," Mr. Bustamente said.
"Ixcanul," which won the Alfred Bauer Prize at the 65th Berlin International Film Festival, focuses on a poor family in the mountains that arranges for the daughter to marry a plantation overseer. The daughter secretly gets involved with a young man, a drunk and a dreamer, who promises to take her with him to the United States. But he leaves without her and she finds herself pregnant while still engaged to the other man.
After she gives birth in a hospital, a staff member tells her that her baby has died. When the young woman finds out later that her child had lived and had possibly been sold for adoption, grief consumes her.
"Quiet and fearless," the Los Angeles-based film critic Manuel Betancourt wrote of Ms. Coroy's understated performance, which revealed anguish behind a still face.
"I mouthed the words I was feeling in my head," Ms. Coroy said, explaining her acting method. "It was easier then because I was naturally timid. I'm much more animated now."
Her second film with Mr. Bustamante, "La Llorona," transformed a traditional Latin American ghost story into an indictment of a fictional dictator, but one clearly reminiscent of the Guatemalan leader, Gen. Efraín Ríos Montt. Five years before his death in 2018, General Ríos Montt was found guilty of genocide and crimes against humanity for the systematic slaughter of Maya men, women and children in the 1980s after he took control of the country in a coup.
Ms. Coroy plays Alma, a Maya housemaid whose son and daughter were among those murdered. A spectral figure in white, she haunts the dictator in his home.
A casting director saw her in the two Bustamante films and picked her for the part of an Indigenous guerrilla in "Bel Canto," an American film starring Julianne Moore. For two-and-a-half months, Ms. Coroy filmed in Mexico and the United States, the longest she had ever been away from her family. She froze in New York, she said, and didn't like the food.
The actress prefers not to discuss politics. But Mr. Bustamante said artists in Guatemala worked in an increasingly hostile climate.
"You realize you're in a country where there is a dictatorship without that name," Mr. Bustamante wrote in an email interview. "There is a murky sort of oppression and no rights or freedom."
When "Ixcanul" was released, he wrote, "there was a general rejection by the Guatemalan people of this sort of subject matter. With La Llorona, it was much more dangerous. We received anonymous threats."
"Wakanda Forever," a global blockbuster distributed by Disney, also addresses the oppression of the Maya.
Ms. Coroy's character, Princess Fen, catches smallpox brought by the Spaniards to the Yucatán Peninsula in the 16th century. A shaman gives her a drink that allows her to live and give birth underwater. When her winged son Namor, played by the Mexican actor Tenoch Huerta, returns to the Yucatán, he sees Spaniards beating the Maya they have enslaved.
In Guatemala, some Maya families encourage their children to speak only Spanish and wear Western clothing to escape ongoing rampant discrimination. But that's not how Ms. Coroy was raised.
"My parents tell me I should be proud," said Ms. Coroy, who eventually returned to night school and finished college. "There is no way that you can hide that you're Indigenous."
She has recently begun delving into Maya spirituality. Her grandmother was a natural healer who taught her about the curative properties or herbal teas and flowers. While she worships in a Catholic church, she also studies with an Indigenous spiritual teacher and reads the Maya creation story, the Popol Vuh.
Central to Maya religion is Maximón, a trickster deity both benevolent and hedonistic. In ceremonies, adherents smoke and drink in front of his wooden figure in the hopes he will hear their entreaties. Ms. Coroy attends ceremonies without imbibing, she said.
"I respect Maximón," she said. "I have connected with him in dreams. He said, 'You neither speak well of me nor poorly, so I will protect you."'
While she's famous enough in Guatemala that people in the colonial tourist city of Antigua, a UNESCO World heritage site, approach her politely for autographs, her neighbors in Santa María avoid singling her out. Walking in the town's park, she might as well be any other vendor.
"There's no movie star culture here," Ms. Coroy said. "There are no paparazzi."

For Immigrants, Barriers to Aid Hurt Children: [National Desk]

Full text: NASHVILLE -- Jacqueline Acevedo is a shy seventh grader who spends long hours at the Baptist church where her father serves as a volunteer pastor after earning a scant wage from his day job selling bread.
Gabriel Garcia is a talkative 10-year-old whose mother is a chemist but drives for Uber and whose father squeezes grocery costs by posting receipts on the refrigerator door.
Although the families differ greatly -- Jacqueline's parents are unauthorized Salvadoran immigrants with little education, while Gabriel's left rewarding professions in Venezuela and won legal asylum in the United States -- the Nashville-area youths have two things in common.
They are children of poor immigrants. And their families have less access to aid than natives with the same incomes.
Children of immigrants, the fastest-growing group of American youths, have poverty rates more than twice those of other children. That is partly because their families earn less than native workers, but also because they face more barriers to government support. The barriers are largest for children of undocumented immigrants, but families of legal immigrants face obstacles, too.
More than 40 percent of the country's poor children are children of immigrants. While most are American citizens, about half have an undocumented parent, which bars the whole household from some government benefits. For parents who immigrated legally, obstacles to aid include waiting periods, language barriers and lack of program knowledge.
Were Jacqueline's parents native-born, the family could receive $ 12,000 in tax credits and food subsidies. Being undocumented bars them from three-quarters of that support, leaving Jacqueline -- an American child, Tennessee born and raised -- thousands of dollars below the poverty line.
As legal immigrants who do not speak English, Mr. Garcia and his wife face different impediments. While they qualify for food stamps, they only recently learned of the program and are unsure if it is proper to apply.
The question of immigrants' access to aid has long generated sharp divisions, but the debate has grown more consequential as immigrant families account for a growing share of American children.
"It's a very stupid investment decision to exclude or discourage these children from getting help," said Dolores Acevedo-Garcia, who runs a research group at Brandeis University called diversitydatakids.org. "About 90 percent of these children are U.S. citizens, and even those who aren't are likely to stay here until adulthood. They'll be with us as our future workers, neighbors and taxpayers."
Since most immigrants are Latino or Asian, barriers to aid may also deepen racial and ethnic divides.
Those who support limits on government aid say the country has always expected immigrants to practice self-reliance. They call it unfair to tax Americans for imported poverty, especially when immigrants come illegally, and warn that more welfare could encourage more unauthorized entries. If poverty among immigrants is a problem, they say, the solution is to admit fewer needy immigrants.
Even with the restrictions, immigrants get welfare at elevated rates because they are disproportionately poor.
"The more welfare that immigrants use, the more difficult it becomes to afford anti-poverty initiatives for the native-born," said Steven A. Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that seeks to sharply reduce immigration.
In Nashville, a growing immigration hub, Jacqueline Acevedo's father, Julio, confronts child poverty as parent and pastor. His modest church, which meets in a converted house, acts as a safety net of last resort, offering food, clothing and testaments to God's love to newcomers from across Latin America. Many, like him, are undocumented.
More interested in scripture than politics, Mr. Acevedo, 47, is reluctant to complain about restrictions on immigrant aid. "I'm very, very, grateful to God and to this country because I'm aware that I'm better off here," he said.
But when he talked of seeing children in church without enough to eat, his voice caught.
"I know what it's like to be hungry," he said.
Fleeing Violence and Hardship
Poverty is all Mr. Acevedo has known. He was born just before the Salvadoran civil war, and was 4 when his father died of an undiagnosed disease. Soldiers burned the family home, leaving his mother a homeless widow with more children than she could feed. He joined the army at 16 but left it a dozen years later to avoid a mission in Iraq.
By then, his wife, Rosa, had joined a brother in Nashville and found work as a cook. Mr. Acevedo followed, leaving their sons, 2 and 4, with relatives. Though he planned to return in a few years, the separation lasted two decades, as the Acevedos decided the best way to help their sons was to send money for their education. The family reunited only a few weeks ago when the brothers, weary of the separation, made their own unauthorized journey to Tennessee.
The birth of Jacqueline, 12 years ago, further rooted the Acevedos in the United States. "She is a gift of God," Mr. Acevedo said.
Like all children, she is also an expense. Working together, the Acevedos earned about $ 26,000 a year during the pandemic selling bread to grocery stores, and Mr. Acevedo spends Fridays on volunteer church work, to thank God for saving him from war and alcoholism. Since Jacqueline is a citizen, they receive the child tax credit, and she receives free school meals and Medicaid.
Native-born families and most legal immigrants could get much more: roughly $ 9,300 in food stamps and the earned-income tax credit, which undocumented immigrants cannot collect. (Though Jacqueline is eligible for a prorated food stamp benefit, the family is unaware of the policy.) The additional aid would lift her above the government poverty line.
Immigrants compensate for barriers to aid in part by working more.
Mr. Acevedo's assistant pastor and half brother, Fredi Hernandez, works in a factory. Mr. Hernandez's wife cleans, and their two daughters, 18 and 21, mix work and school and give the parents most of their pay. (The adults are undocumented, and a young son is a citizen.)
"It's very important we all work," Mr. Hernandez said.
The pooled earnings lift the family above the poverty line, but they struggled when they arrived seven years ago. Fleeing gang violence that killed a friend, one daughter developed temporary facial paralysis, grew depressed and cut herself, but the family could not afford medical care.
"We felt powerless," Mr. Hernandez said. "I'm not complaining -- it's just a fact. We understand we come from a different country."
Inside the church, one family's hardships have left an especially vivid impression. Luz Canales and her husband, undocumented immigrants from Honduras, were living in a garage with five young children when they first came to church. Her husband fell ill and could not work. Ineligible for food stamps, though they received free school meals, the children arrived at services so hungry that Mr. Acevedo took them home to eat.
"Look, there's one thing I want you to understand," Mr. Acevedo said, referring to the limits on immigrant aid. "The fact that I'm not complaining doesn't mean I don't have my opinion that it's unjust."
Citing scriptural commands to seek justice, he said he was speaking out despite the risks to encourage compassion. "Sometimes we see each other's struggles but feel indifference -- there's no love," he said.
Most Need, Least Access
Fears that poor immigrants will prove costly are old as the country itself. But only since the Great Society initiatives of the 1960s, which expanded immigration and aid, has mass migration coincided with a welfare state. Congress in the 1970s barred undocumented immigrants from most programs, and in 1996 it reduced access for many legal immigrants, too.
Most adult legal immigrants must wait five years to get public aid, unless they are elderly. While noncitizen children typically qualify without a wait, the adult restrictions reduce the family's income.
Program by program, immigrant eligibility varies greatly, with no obvious logic. Undocumented parents with citizen children get one cash subsidy (the child tax credit) but not another (the earned-income tax credit). Undocumented children receive school meals but not food stamps.
Nearly 20 million children in the United States have an immigrant parent, and since the 1970s their share of the child population has quadrupled to 27 percent. Fully 44 percent of poor children have an immigrant parent, according to research by Ms. Acevedo-Garcia, the Urban Institute, and UnidosUS, a Latino advocacy group. Nearly a fifth of poor children have an undocumented parent.
"There's no way to reduce child poverty without including immigrant kids," said Brayan Rosa-Rodriguez, a UnidosUS analyst.
Robert Rector of the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the country should admit fewer low-skilled immigrants, both legal and undocumented. About 11 million undocumented immigrants live in the United States, and roughly half of the adults lack high school degrees.
"It's inevitable that large numbers of them are going to be poor," he said. "The solution is to stop importing poverty."
The Trump administration tried to penalize welfare use among legal immigrants by counting it against them if they sought permanent residency. Although courts blocked the so-called public charge rule after several months, critics say the publicity has left some families afraid to seek aid.
But sympathies shifted during the coronavirus pandemic when undocumented immigrants won new appreciation as "essential workers." After initially denying stimulus checks to undocumented households, Congress passed a bill extending the aid to members of the household lawfully present.
"That was a teachable moment -- it showed the costs of leaving large numbers of people unattended," said Michael Fix of the Migration Policy Institute, who, in a study with Jeanne Batalova, found that poverty in noncitizen families plummeted as a result of the aid.
While child poverty has fallen in recent decades for both immigrant and native households, large disparities remain. According to Ms. Acevedo-Garcia and her colleagues, the prepandemic poverty rate was 9.3 percent for children of natives, 20.1 percent for children of immigrants, and 31.1 for American children in undocumented families.
Even when eligible for aid, immigrants are less likely to receive it. "There are language barriers, knowledge barriers, fear issues, trust," said Tara Lentz, co-director of Conexion Americas, a Nashville group named for the connections it helps immigrants make.
Nationwide, about 82 percent of eligible people get food stamps, but only 60 percent of eligible noncitizens, government data shows. Immigrant families eligible for the earned-income tax credit are 28 percent less likely to report getting it, according to a recent study in the journal Health Affairs by Dana Thomson and three co-authors.
In a comprehensive study last year, Child Trends, a research group, found that in 2019 government aid cut child poverty by 47 percent in native families but only 39 percent among immigrants. Citing limits in the data, Ms. Thomson, a co-author, said the gap is likely larger.
"The people who most need the aid have the least access to it," she said.
'Work for What You Want'
Public aid was the last thing that Jose Garcia and Yamile Yepez had in mind five years ago when they flew from Caracas to the United States. The prosperous couple were taking their 5-year-old, Gabriel, to Disney World, when they learned that intruders had broken in their house. In a country saturated with political violence, Mr. Garcia, a government computer engineer, had already survived a kidnapping. He considered the break-in a death threat.
"We left it all behind, everything," he said, abandoning house, cars, and savings to seek asylum.
Suddenly poor, the couple spent two years pursuing legal protection, mostly without authorization to work. They did odd jobs, borrowed from family, and "only rarely" ate less to feed Gabriel. Ineligible for most aid while waiting, they were afraid to seek it anyway for fear it would harm their case. "I thought it might be illegal," Mr. Garcia said.
Without health insurance, Ms. Yepez used expired birth control pills she had brought from Venezuela and learned to her distress that she was pregnant. A second son and legal papers arrived in close succession -- she thanks God for each -- but economic progress has been slowed by their lack of English.
Until recently, Mr. Garcia drove for Uber, with net earnings of $ 20,000 a year. Tax forms filed by a paid preparer show they also received about $ 11,000 in tax credits -- benefits they do not understand -- but that still leaves them well below the poverty line. They know little about other programs and are wary of government help.
"You have to work for what you want," Mr. Garcia said. "I wouldn't use it unless I really need it."
Gabriel's teacher recently suggested they apply for food stamps, the first they had heard of the program. They could likely collect about $ 7,500 a year but hesitate to apply, citing their belief in self-sufficiency and fear the aid would harm their legal status. (Under current law, it would not.)
Mr. Garcia recently found a job in a battery recycling plant at $ 15 an hour, a step up from Uber driving. With Ms. Yepez driving for Uber while the children are in school, their income may exceed the government poverty line this year -- about $ 33,000 for a Nashville-area family of four. But she may never regain what she had in Venezuela, with a doctorate and a job in a pharmaceutical plant.
Told that children of immigrants are disproportionately poor, Mr. Garcia expressed no surprise.
"The immigrant experience is rough," he said, adding with a hint of willed optimism: "You have to find ways to feel good about what you do have, knowing that things will get better over time."

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Jacqueline Acevedo is a shy seventh grader who spends long hours at the Baptist church where her father serves as a volunteer pastor after earning a scant wage from his day job selling bread.
Gabriel Garcia is a talkative 10-year-old whose mother is a chemist but drives for Uber and whose father squeezes grocery costs by posting receipts on the refrigerator door.
Although the families differ greatly — Jacqueline’s parents are Salvadoran immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, with little education, while Gabriel’s left rewarding professions in Venezuela and won legal asylum in the United States — the Nashville-area youths have two things in common.
They are children of poor immigrants. And their families have less access to aid than natives with the same incomes.
Children of immigrants, the fastest-growing group of American youths, have poverty rates more than twice those of other children. That is partly because their families earn less than native workers and also because they face more barriers to government support. The barriers are largest for children of immigrants living in the country without legal permission, but families of legal immigrants face obstacles, too.
More than 40% of the country’s poor children are children of immigrants. While most are American citizens, about half have a parent living in the country without legal permission, which bars the whole household from some government benefits. For parents who immigrated legally, obstacles to aid include waiting periods, language barriers and lack of program knowledge.
Were Jacqueline’s parents native-born, the family could receive $12,000 in tax credits and food subsidies. Living in the country without legal permission bars them from three-quarters of that support, leaving Jacqueline — an American child, Tennessee-born and raised — thousands of dollars below the poverty line.
As legal immigrants who do not speak English, Gabriel’s parents face different impediments. While they qualify for food stamps, they only recently learned of the program and are unsure if it is proper to apply.
The question of immigrants’ access to aid has long generated sharp divisions, but the debate has grown more consequential as immigrant families account for a growing share of American children.
“It’s a very stupid investment decision to exclude or discourage these children from getting help,” said Dolores Acevedo-Garcia, who runs a research group at Brandeis University called diversitydatakids.org. “About 90% of these children are U.S. citizens, and even those who aren’t are likely to stay here until adulthood. They’ll be with us as our future workers, neighbors and taxpayers.”
Since most immigrants are Latino or Asian, barriers to aid may also deepen racial and ethnic divides.
Those who support limits on government aid say the country has always expected immigrants to practice self-reliance. They call it unfair to tax Americans for imported poverty, especially when immigrants come illegally, and warn that more welfare could encourage more unauthorized entries. If poverty among immigrants is a problem, they say, the solution is to admit fewer needy immigrants.
Even with the restrictions, immigrants get welfare at elevated rates because they are disproportionately poor.
“The more welfare that immigrants use, the more difficult it becomes to afford anti-poverty initiatives for the native-born,” said Steven Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that seeks to sharply reduce immigration.
In Nashville, a growing immigration hub, Jacqueline’s father, Julio Acevedo, 47, confronts child poverty as a parent and pastor. His modest church, which meets in a converted house, acts as a safety net of last resort, offering food, clothing and testaments to God’s love to newcomers from across Latin America. Many, like him, are living in the country without legal permission.
More interested in scripture than politics, Acevedo, is reluctant to complain about restrictions on immigrant aid. “I’m very, very grateful to God and to this country because I’m aware that I’m better off here,” he said.
But when he talked of seeing children in church without enough to eat, his voice caught.
“I know what it’s like to be hungry,” he said.
Fleeing Violence and Hardship
Poverty is all Acevedo has known. He was born just before the Salvadoran civil war and was 4 when his father died of an undiagnosed disease. Soldiers burned the family home, leaving his mother a homeless widow with more children than she could feed. He joined the army at 16 but left it a dozen years later to avoid a mission in Iraq.
By then, his wife, Rosa Acevedo, had joined a brother in Nashville and found work as a cook. Julio Acevedo followed, leaving their sons, 2 and 4, with relatives. Although he planned to return in a few years, the separation lasted two decades, as the Acevedos decided the best way to help their sons was to send money for their education. The family reunited only a few weeks ago when the brothers, weary of the separation, made their own unauthorized journey to Tennessee.
The birth of Jacqueline, 12 years ago, further rooted the Acevedos in the United States. “She is a gift of God,” Julio Acevedo said.
Like all children, she is also an expense. Working together, the Acevedos earned about $26,000 a year during the pandemic selling bread to grocery stores, and Julio Acevedo spends Fridays on volunteer church work, to thank God for saving him from war and alcoholism. Since Jacqueline is a citizen, they receive the child tax credit, and she receives free school meals and Medicaid.
Native-born families and most legal immigrants could get much more: roughly $9,300 in food stamps and the earned-income tax credit, which immigrants living in the country without legal permission cannot collect. (Although Jacqueline is eligible for a prorated food stamp benefit, the family is unaware of the policy.) The additional aid would lift her above the government poverty line.
Immigrants compensate for barriers to aid in part by working more.
Julio Acevedo’s assistant pastor and half-brother, Fredi Hernandez, works in a factory. Hernandez’s wife cleans, and their two daughters, 18 and 21, mix work and school and give the parents most of their pay. (The adults are living in the country without legal permission, and a young son is a citizen.)
“It’s very important we all work,” Hernandez said.
The pooled earnings lift the family above the poverty line, but they struggled when they arrived seven years ago. Fleeing gang violence that killed a friend, one daughter developed temporary facial paralysis, grew depressed and cut herself, but the family could not afford medical care.
“We felt powerless,” Hernandez said. “I’m not complaining; it’s just a fact. We understand we come from a different country.”
Inside the church, one family’s hardships have left an especially vivid impression. Luz Canales and her husband, immigrants from Honduras living in the U.S. without legal permission, were living in a garage with five young children when they first came to church. Her husband fell ill and could not work. Ineligible for food stamps, though they received free school meals, the children arrived at services so hungry that Julio Acevedo took them home to eat.
“Look, there’s one thing I want you to understand,” Acevedo said, referring to the limits on immigrant aid. “The fact that I’m not complaining doesn’t mean I don’t have my opinion that it’s unjust.”
Citing scriptural commands to seek justice, he said he was speaking out despite the risks to encourage compassion. “Sometimes we see each other’s struggles but feel indifference; there’s no love,” he said.
Most Need, Least Access
Fears that poor immigrants will prove costly are old as the country itself. But only since the Great Society initiatives of the 1960s, which expanded immigration and aid, has mass migration coincided with a welfare state. Congress in the 1970s barred immigrants living in the country without legal permission from most programs, and in 1996, it reduced access for many legal immigrants, too.
Most adult legal immigrants must wait five years to get public aid, unless they are elderly. While noncitizen children typically qualify without a wait, the adult restrictions reduce the family’s income.
Program by program, immigrant eligibility varies greatly, with no obvious logic. Parents living in the country without legal permission with citizen children get one cash subsidy (the child tax credit) but not another (the earned-income tax credit). Children living in the country without legal permission receive school meals but not food stamps.
Nearly 20 million children in the United States have an immigrant parent, and since the 1970s, their share of the child population has quadrupled to 27%. Fully 44% of poor children have an immigrant parent, according to research by Acevedo-Garcia, the Urban Institute and UnidosUS, a Latino advocacy group. Nearly one-fifth of poor children have a parent living in the country without legal permission.
“There’s no way to reduce child poverty without including immigrant kids,” said Brayan Rosa-Rodriguez, a UnidosUS analyst.
Robert Rector of the conservative Heritage Foundation said the country should admit fewer low-skilled immigrants, both legal and those living in the country without legal permission. About 11 million immigrants live in the United States without legal permission, and roughly half of the adults lack high school degrees.
“It’s inevitable that large numbers of them are going to be poor,” he said. “The solution is to stop importing poverty.”
The Trump administration tried to penalize welfare use among legal immigrants by counting it against them if they sought permanent residency. Although courts blocked the so-called public charge rule after several months, critics say the publicity has left some families afraid to seek aid.
But sympathies shifted during the coronavirus pandemic when immigrants living in the country without legal permission won new appreciation as “essential workers.” After initially denying stimulus checks to others in households of immigrants living in the country without legal permission, Congress passed a bill extending the aid to members of the household lawfully present.
“That was a teachable moment; it showed the costs of leaving large numbers of people unattended,” said Michael Fix of the Migration Policy Institute, who, in a study with Jeanne Batalova, found that poverty in noncitizen families plummeted as a result of the aid.
While child poverty has fallen in recent decades for both immigrant and native households, large disparities remain. According to Acevedo-Garcia and her colleagues, the pre-pandemic poverty rate was 9.3% for children of natives, 20.1% for children of immigrants, and 31.1% for American children in families living in the country without legal permission.
Even when eligible for aid, immigrants are less likely to receive it. “There are language barriers, knowledge barriers, fear issues, trust,” said Tara Lentz, co-director of Conexion Americas, a Nashville group named for the connections it helps immigrants make.
Nationwide, about 82% of eligible people get food stamps but only 60% of eligible noncitizens, government data shows. Immigrant families eligible for the earned-income tax credit are 28% less likely to report getting it, according to a recent study in the journal Health Affairs by Dana Thomson and three co-authors.

Public aid was the last thing that Jose Garcia and Yamile Yepez had in mind five years ago when they flew from Caracas, Venezuela, to the United States. The prosperous couple were taking their 5-year-old, Gabriel, to Disney World, when they learned that intruders had broken into their house. In a country saturated with political violence, Garcia, a government computer engineer, had already survived a kidnapping. He considered the break-in a death threat.
“We left it all behind, everything,” he said, abandoning house, cars and savings to seek asylum.
Suddenly poor, the couple spent two years pursuing legal protection, mostly without authorization to work. They did odd jobs, borrowed from family, and “only rarely” ate less to feed Gabriel. Ineligible for most aid while waiting, they were afraid to seek it anyway, for fear it would harm their case. “I thought it might be illegal,” Garcia said.
Without health insurance, Yepez used expired birth control pills she had brought from Venezuela and learned to her distress that she was pregnant. A second son and legal papers arrived in close succession — she thanks God for each — but economic progress has been slowed by their lack of English.
Until recently, Garcia drove for Uber, with net earnings of $20,000 a year. Tax forms filed by a paid preparer show they also received about $11,000 in tax credits — benefits they do not understand — but that still leaves them well below the poverty line. They know little about other programs and are wary of government help.
“You have to work for what you want,” Garcia said. “I wouldn’t use it unless I really need it.”
Gabriel’s teacher recently suggested they apply for food stamps, the first they had heard of the program. They could likely collect about $7,500 a year but hesitate to apply, citing their belief in self-sufficiency and fear the aid would harm their legal status. (Under current law, it would not.)
Garcia recently found a job in a battery recycling plant at $15 an hour, a step up from Uber driving. With Yepez driving for Uber while the children are in school, their income may exceed the government poverty line this year — about $33,000 for a Nashville-area family of four. But she may never regain what she had in Venezuela, with a doctorate and a job in a pharmaceutical plant.
Told that children of immigrants are disproportionately poor, Garcia expressed no surprise.
“The immigrant experience is rough,” he said, adding with a hint of willed optimism, “You have to find ways to feel good about what you do have, knowing that things will get better over time.”

Endeavor and W.W.E. Join Forces for Live-Combat Tag Team: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The new company, with the stock ticker "TKO," is betting that the value of rights for live events like wrestling will continue to soar.
The tens of thousands of fans who crowded into SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles for WrestleMania this weekend got to watch the wrestling icon John Cena be hurled to the canvas by Austin Theory, one of World Wrestling Entertainment's biggest stars.
Offstage, bankers and executives huddled in conference suites at the stadium to put the finishing touches on a new plot for W.W.E.'s future. Endeavor, an entertainment colossus run by the Hollywood power broker Ari Emanuel, was finalizing a deal to acquire W.W.E. and merge it with Ultimate Fighting Championship, the combat sports league Endeavor owns.
News of the deal, which aims to create a new public company worth more than $ 21 billion, broke Sunday before the second night of WrestleMania, with Mr. Emanuel in attendance alongside Vince McMahon, the executive chairman of W.W.E. The companies officially announced the deal Monday morning, saying the as-yet unnamed firm -- whose stock will trade under the symbol "TKO" -- would be a juggernaut in live entertainment and combat sports.
The deal is expected to close near the end of the year, pending regulatory approval. Endeavor would own 51 percent of the company and existing W.W.E. shareholders would control 49 percent.
"Must-watch TV is a rarity these days," said Mark Shapiro, Endeavor's president and chief operating officer, who will also have those roles at the new company. "And unicorns like the U.F.C. and W.W.E. will be heavily in demand."
In fusing Ultimate Fighting Championship with World Wrestling Entertainment, Mr. Emanuel and Mr. McMahon are betting that traditional TV companies and video-streaming giants will continue to pay top dollar for the rights to show live events -- including scripted and unscripted fights.
The National Football League in December struck an agreement with YouTube TV that values its Sunday Ticket package of games at as much as $ 2.5 billion annually -- an increase of about $ 1 billion from the deal with its previous partner, DirecTV. The National Basketball Association is expecting to sharply increase its fees after its TV agreements expire following the 2024-25 season.
The intense competition between cable TV and deep-pocketed tech companies is behind the ballooning costs. As viewers abandon traditional television, live events like N.F.L. games and W.W.E. matches continue to draw big ratings, helping anchor the cable TV business. And tech giants like Amazon and Alphabet are using live sports to draw new subscribers to their services, creating a bidding war for rights.
Executives aim to use the tie-up of W.W.E. and U.F.C. to take advantage of that demand. U.F.C.'s contract with the Walt Disney Company's ESPN division ends in the next few years, and W.W.E.'s deals with NBCUniversal's USA Network and the Fox broadcast network are set to expire next year.
Shares of W.W.E. and Endeavor traded lower on Monday, with W.W.E. down about 2 percent and Endeavor down about 6 percent at market close. Brandon Ross, an analyst for LightShed Partners, said prices were fluctuating based on investor expectations for the value of the upcoming rights renegotiations.
"Shareholders are currently trying to determine how they see these rights renewals working out in an environment that has been good to sports rights holders but is difficult overall," he said.
The combination is the latest in a series of audacious deals struck by Mr. Emanuel, the workaholic Hollywood talent agent who rose from the mailroom to become one of the entertainment industry's most important figures. Mr. Emanuel will be the chief executive of the new company and will keep his chief executive title at Endeavor, which will continue to own other businesses, including the William Morris Endeavor talent agency and the Professional Bull Riding league.
The deal also provides a coda to a tumultuous chapter in Mr. McMahon's career. He was reinstated as executive chairman of W.W.E. in January after resigning from that position last year following an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment. Mr. McMahon will stay on at the new company as executive chairman, part of an 11-person board that will include six members from Endeavor and five members from W.W.E.
The Wall Street Journal reported last June that Mr. McMahon agreed to pay a secret $ 3 million settlement to an employee with whom he was said to have had an affair, and that the board had been investigating since April last year. The investigation unearthed other nondisclosure agreements involving claims of misconduct by Mr. McMahon.
Mr. McMahon acknowledged the harassment claims in an interview on Monday from Endeavor's Los Angeles offices.
"I've made mistakes in my 50-year career, both in business and personally, and I've always owned up to them," he said.
Mr. Emanuel said that he believed in "due process," adding that Mr. McMahon "takes full responsibility for what happened."
Dana White, the president of U.F.C., will keep that role at the combined company, and Nick Khan, the chief executive of W.W.E., will stay on as president. Patrick Whitesell, the prominent Hollywood executive and agent who represents actors including Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, will remain executive chairman of Endeavor.
Stephanie McMahon, Mr. McMahon's daughter and the former co-chief executive of W.W.E., will not have a role at W.W.E. after the deal, Mr. McMahon said, but Paul Levesque -- W.W.E.'s chief content officer also known by his wrestling name, "Triple H" -- will continue to work in that capacity.
The deal puts a hefty valuation on U.F.C., which Endeavor and its backers purchased for about $ 4 billion in 2016, and W.W.E., which was seeking about $ 9 billion in a deal. The all-stock deal values U.F.C. at $ 12.1 billion and W.W.E. at $ 9.3 billion. Mr. Shapiro said that the competitive sale process W.W.E. ran justified its "healthy price."
In the interview, Mr. Emanuel was enthusiastic about the possibility of creating shows and movies from W.W.E. characters, calling them "superheroes."
Mr. Emanuel described the company's intellectual property rights as "some of the greatest I.P. in the world." Endeavor is also betting the price tag will be justified by businesses other than rights, like selling sponsorships, creating new events and striking deals with social media companies Mr. Shapiro said.
The deal for W.W.E. came together quickly. Over the past several weeks, Mr. Emanuel and Mr. Shapiro visited W.W.E.'s headquarters in Stamford, Conn., and the offices of Raine, an investment bank in New York to finalize the details. On Sunday, as WrestleMania reached its conclusion, Endeavor and W.W.E. pinned down the final details.
Although Mr. Emanuel was one of the inspirations for the super-agent Ari Gold on the HBO show "Entourage," he said he wasn't likely to appear as a character in the W.W.E.'s story universe in the way that Mr. McMahon has.
"I'm a character already in my own mind," Mr. Emanuel said. "I don't need to share that with anybody."

Number of Remote Workers Is Debated: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: New Labor Department numbers indicate that fewer Americans worked remotely last year. But many experts criticize the government's data collection.
Millions of workers, employers, square feet of real estate and dollars of downtown economic retail are wrapped up in the question of how many people are working from home -- yet there remain large discrepancies in how remote work is measured.
The Labor Department, last week, released data indicating a decline in remote work: 72.5 percent of businesses said their employees rarely or never teleworked last year, up from 60.1 percent in 2021 and quite close to the 76.7 percent that had no such work before the pandemic. But while the Labor Department found that remote work was almost back to prepandemic levels, many other surveys show it is up four- to fivefold.
Outside research, including a monthly survey of workers from researchers at Stanford University and the Census Bureau's household survey, indicate that remote work remains prevalent, with Stanford's finding that it accounts for over a quarter of paid full-time workdays in the United States, just slightly down from 33 percent in 2021. Some scholars suggested that the Labor Department's survey may overcount fully in-person work, though the comparisons among the various surveys aren't direct.
"I see this survey as an outlier and not the most reliable measure," said Adam Ozimek, chief economist of the Economic Innovation Group, a public policy organization, describing the Labor Department's survey. "We need to think hard as we try to develop better measures of working from home."
Remote work is having profound effects on nearly every dimension of the economy: foot traffic to downtown businesses, housing markets in big cities and far-flung areas, methods of assessing productivity and child care. Public transportation ridership sank during the pandemic, and suburban real estate values rose.
Nearly one billion square feet of office real estate was available but in search of a tenant at the end of 2022. People refashioned their lives and routines, working 28 percent more after traditional hours, according to Microsoft.
The stakes of measuring remote work's prevalence are high. And researchers said the wording of the Bureau of Labor Statistics survey on remote work, which was distributed to businesses, might have caused some confusion among respondents.
"Telework is a work arrangement that allows an employee to work at home, or from another remote location, by using the internet or a computer linked to one's place of employment, as well as digital communications, such as email and phone," the survey read. "Do any employees at this location CURRENTLY telework in any amount?"
By defining telework so broadly -- as any worker sending an email or making a call outside the office -- the Labor Department's survey question should most likely have turned up a fully in-person figure lower than the one released last week, said Nick Bloom, an economist at Stanford, suggesting that some businesses may have been confused by the question.
This particular Labor Department figure on telework also combines fully remote work with hybrid arrangements. But hybrid work has eclipsed fully remote policies, with just over half of the workers who can do their jobs from home combining in-person and remote work, according to Gallup.
A spokeswoman for the Labor Department said the survey most likely did not reflect informal work-from-home arrangements.
"Taking into account that the self-employed and the public sector are not included in the sample, and that this is a survey of establishments rather than individuals, our estimates do not appear out of line with other estimates," the spokeswoman said.
Stanford's monthly study on working from home, which surveys 10,000 workers across cities and industries, found that 27 percent of paid full-time days were worked from home in early 2023.
Much of that remote work came from hybrid setups. Last month, the survey found that 12 percent of workers were fully remote, roughly 60 percent fully in person and 28 percent hybrid.
Other sources of data confirm that working-from-home patterns remain entrenched in certain industries. The building security firm Kastle, for example, tracks data on office badge swipes and reported this month that offices remained at roughly 48 percent of their prepandemic occupancy.
A closer look at New York, from the Partnership for New York City, found that 52 percent of Manhattan office workers were working in person on an average day at the start of this year, up from 49 percent in September. But only 9 percent of employees were in the office five days a week, underscoring the reach of hybrid arrangements. And Square, the retail technology company, which tracks payments at food and drink establishments, found that sales growth at bars and restaurants in Brooklyn had recently outpaced growth of those in Manhattan.
"It's clear that the work-from-home trends induced by the pandemic have transformed the food and drink scene in the city," said Ara Kharazian, an economist at Square.
The Partnership for New York City's data indicated that financial service firms were back in the office in greater numbers than many other companies. Financial service firms reported 59 percent daily office attendance in late January, according to the partnership. The tech industry, by contrast, was at 43 percent.
All this data is emerging as hundreds of companies formalize their policies on hybrid work, with many trying to persuade their employees to spend more time at the office.
Amazon told corporate workers last month that they had to be in the office three days a week starting in May, and Starbucks called its 3,750 corporate workers back three days a week as well. Disney asked employees to return to the office four days a week. Its chief executive, Robert A. Iger, cited the need for in-person creative collaborations.
Other chief executives have also begun to question the merits of remote work. Even Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce, which told all its employees that they could go permanently remote, began voicing concern this year that productivity among some employees has been lower.
As executives clamp down on in-person work, worker resistance has become more vocal. At Amazon, more than 29,000 employees joined a Slack channel, called Remote Advocacy, protesting the shift to in-person work. At Starbucks, more than 40 corporate employees signed an open letter opposing the new return-to-office policy.
Wherever people are doing the jobs they already have, mostly in person per the Labor Department or over a quarter of the time at home per others, one metric does indicate that hybrid work is here to stay: job postings.
A study from researchers at Stanford, Harvard and other institutions analyzing over 50 million job postings last month found that postings explicitly mentioning remote work are at 12.2 percent -- a fourfold increase since before the pandemic.

Can't Find Romance? Maybe It's Across the Ocean.: [Society Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For some American women, relocating outside of the United States has improved their dating lives. But some warn that finding love involves more than a change of address.
Kacey Margo has been going on plenty of fun dates ever since she moved to Paris in October 2019. Men frequently approach her with the dramatic antics seen in Disney movies.
"This one guy was like, 'I ran through traffic just to look into your eyes once, and if you don't want to go on a date with me, I can die happy knowing that I just met you,"' said Ms. Margo, a 28-year-old English teacher from Los Angeles.
After studying abroad in Paris in 2016, Ms. Margo fell in love with the city (and its men). She found a gig teaching English in Paris and moved there after she graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in May 2019.
Now, Ms. Margo is living a dream of many American women who are seeking relationships abroad, some of whom cite the toxic dating scene in the United States.
Tinder Passport, a subscription service that allows users to match with people in a destination of their choice, is one of the app's most popular features, with a majority of members using it up to nine times a month, said Stephanie Danzi, the senior vice president of global marketing at Tinder. From 2022 to 2023, there was a distinct increase in the number of female members shifting interest to unique locations.
There is even a dating show that premiered last month on the cable channel Freeform, "Love Trip: Paris," where four American women move to an apartment building in Paris filled with eligible French darlings. Although each woman has various levels of dating experience, they are all looking to find a French lover. ("I'm in Paris to find my woman," Caroline Renner, 26, said on the season premiere. "I am looking for a fresh start," Josielyn Aguilera, 26, said.)
"Paris is, for a lot of people, the epitome of romance," said Susan House, the executive producer of the show. "American women love Paris." Romanticized images of an American woman in a beret roaming through the streets of Paris, kissing a French partner by the Eiffel Tower -- they are enchanting for many. (Think: "Emily in Paris.")
But there are other reasons people want to date outside the United States.
For Ms. Margo, a Black woman who attended predominantly white institutions throughout her school years, she felt ignored in the United States, as if she "was not an option," she said. In Paris she felt seen.
As for the women in "Love Trip: Paris," they were all exhausted with casual dating in the United States.
"They felt like by going to a different country, suitors are more serious, or there's more intention behind their actions," Ms. House said. It's a sentiment that is shared by many American women who have had disappointing dating experiences in the states and feel that moving to a different country might help them open up to the idea of love again.
Alexis Brown, for example, noticed a lack of "effort and intention" from the men she was dating in Atlanta, where she attended Spelman College.
"The dating culture in the U.S. is that it's cool and normalized to be indifferent to someone and not really express how you genuinely feel," Ms. Brown, 23, said.
When she traveled across Europe for vacation from October 2022 to January 2023, however, the people she dated made it clear that they wanted to spend time with her.
"Their interest could have been tied to the fact that I was just different from anybody they had ever met before," said Ms. Brown, who works in communication and social media. Regardless, she appreciated making meaningful connections and new encounters.
"I was just open and interested in meeting different people and having cultural exchanges," she said.
Cepee Tabibian, who moved to Madrid at 35 from Austin, Texas, felt similarly. She was excited to meet people in Spain, where she noticed a culture of getting married or having children later in life than in the United States, or not getting married at all. "When I walked into the room, I wasn't the oldest person," Ms. Tabibian said. "I wasn't the only single person."
In Austin, dating apps became tiresome for her. "I felt like every guy was the same guy," she said. "I felt like if I stayed there, I'm probably going to be single forever."
Being in a new environment made Ms. Tabibian "very playful" in dating. "I didn't have the history of dating guys in Spain," she said. "I wasn't jaded."
Going on dates that were spoken entirely in Spanish was also an enjoyable challenge for Ms. Tabibian, who is Iranian and Colombian but did not grow up speaking Spanish.
In 2020, she met her partner, who is Spanish. Now, she is the founder of She Hit Refresh, a community that helps women over the age of 30 move to a different country.
For Cindy Sheahan, meeting people outside of her circles in Denver was momentous. She started traveling solo shortly after ending her 30-year marriage in 2016.
She found the men she dated in Denver after her divorce to be unadventurous. She said she went on 60 dates in 2017.
"It was like a comedy show," she said.
At the end of 2017, she quit her job and traveled throughout Southeast Asia for leisure, and she started using Tinder.
"Because they were out there living their life, there was a lot more energy to the dates," Ms. Sheahan, 61, said about the people she met while traveling. "It wasn't just somebody meeting after their work at the bank, on their way home to let out the dog in Denver."
In 2018, she met her partner of five years, Jean-Marie Mas, a 61-year-old professional tandem paraglider from Dordogne, France, in Nepal.
"You're not tied to your history," said Ms. Sheahan, who now lives in Porto, Portugal. "You're living more freely."
For Frantzces Lys, it was also important to be around people who are passionate about traveling. She found dating to be difficult in the United States, but ultimately she crossed paths with her current partner, Samiyyah Williams, after buying a one-way ticket to Thailand. She had just experienced a breakup in Silver Spring, Md., and the move was a part of her healing journey, she said.
She started a podcast called "Chronicles Abroad" with her co-host, who had met Ms. Williams, 40, in Malaysia. In 2018, Ms. Lys interviewed Ms. Williams, the founder of a consultancy, and the two kept in touch. They started dating years later.
"When you decide to just live your life for yourself, you actually end up stumbling upon people that match your energy and the same ideals and values," said Ms. Lys, a 42-year-old founder of a wellness company.
So, it's not just about the country. "Can you go to a beautiful city and find love, or are you bringing your baggage with you?" Ms. House, the executive producer of "Love Trip: Paris" said. That was the social experiment of the dating show after all: "You take these four women who have had a lot of issues dating, and now they're in Paris. They have a lot of the same issues," Ms. House said.
"I would argue that somebody isn't just looking for love, they might be seeking out something more deep in themselves," said Jess Carbino, a former sociologist for Tinder. "The issues we have transcend geographic borders in terms of what is motivating us internally."
That is precisely why the focal point for many women moving abroad is to learn more about themselves in a new environment; dating is just a piece of the bigger picture.
Ms. Brown, for example, had underwhelming dating experiences in the United States, but she also wanted to be in a new space. She traveled to 25 cities in 15 countries in three months.
"I felt like it would be hard for me to figure out what I want my life to look like in the same environment that I've always been in," Ms. Brown said. That included learning more about what valuable connections look like for her.
"I really don't know that I've ever been treated better," she said about one man she dated in Vienna, who was equally interested as she was in planning thoughtful dates. "If somebody that I met two days ago can treat me this well, I should focus on building relationships with people who are intentional and want to do the same."
Ms. Tabibian said that anyone who is jaded about dating should definitely try dating abroad. "It can really feel like you're living in your own rom-com," she said.
And while these women take the theatrical romantic encounters with a grain of salt, they serve as a reminder to reject thoughtless advances.
"Now, you won't catch me accepting a date where a guy is like, 'Let's pregame in my car,"' Ms. Brown said, reflecting on a previous encounter she had. "That's an immediate block."

Full text: You may have heard the phrase "parents' rights."
It sounds unobjectionable -- of course parents should have rights -- which is probably why it's become the term of choice for the conservative effort to ban books, censor school curriculums and suppress politically undesirable forms of knowledge.
When House Republicans introduced a bill that would require public schools to notify parents that they are entitled to see course material and lists of books kept in school libraries, they cited "parents' rights" as the reason.
"That's what today is all about: It's about every parent, mom and dad, but most importantly about the students in America," Speaker Kevin McCarthy said. Several Republican-controlled states have either proposed or passed similar measures.
The official name of Florida's infamous "Don't Say Gay" law, prohibiting "classroom discussion about sexual orientation or gender identity," is the Parental Rights in Education Act. And the state's Stop WOKE (short for Wrongs to Our Kids and Employees) Act, which outlaws any school instruction that classifies individuals as "inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously," was framed, similarly, as a victory for the rights of parents.
"By signing this legislation, which is the first in the nation to end corporate wokeness and critical race theory in our schools, we are prioritizing education, not indoctrination," Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez said in a statement. "We will always fight to protect our children and parents from this Marxist-inspired curriculum."
It should be said that this movement for "parents' rights" in Florida has empowered certain parents to remove books, films, even whole classes that threaten to expose their children to material that might make them uncomfortable. In Pinellas County, for example, a single complaint about the Disney film "Ruby Bridges" -- about the 6-year-old girl who integrated an all-white New Orleans school in 1960 -- led to its removal from an elementary school.
In his successful 2021 campaign for the Virginia governor's mansion, Glenn Youngkin made "parents matter" his slogan, and he has asserted "parents' rights" in his effort to regulate the treatment of transgender children and end "divisive concepts" such as "critical race theory" in schools. His early moves included new history standards that removed discussions of racism and downplayed the role of slavery in causing the Civil War.
And at this moment, Texas Republicans are debating a bill -- backed by Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick -- that, according to The Texas Tribune, "would severely restrict classroom lessons, school activities and teacher guidance about sexual orientation and gender identity in all public and charter schools up to 12th grade." Texas parents, The Tribune notes, already have the right to "remove their child temporarily from a class or activity that conflicts with their beliefs or review all instructional materials." This bill would further empower parents to object to books, lessons and entire curriculums.
"Parents' rights," you will have noticed, never seems to involve parents who want schools to be more open and accommodating toward gender-nonconforming students. It's never invoked for parents who want their students to learn more about race, identity and the darker parts of American history. And we never hear about the rights of parents who want schools to offer a wide library of books and materials to their children.
"Parents' rights," like "states' rights," is quite particular. It's not about all parents and all children and all the rights they might have.
The reality of the "parents' rights" movement is that it is meant to empower a conservative and reactionary minority of parents to dictate education and curriculums to the rest of the community. It is, in essence, an institutionalization of the heckler's veto, in which a single parent -- or any individual, really -- can remove hundreds of books or shut down lessons on the basis of that one person's political discomfort. "Parents' rights," in other words, is when some parents have the right to dominate all the others.
And, of course, the point of this movement -- the point of creating this state-sanctioned heckler's veto -- is to undermine public education through a thousand little cuts, each meant to weaken public support for teachers and public schools, and to open the floodgates to policies that siphon funds and resources from public institutions and pump them into private ones. The Texas bill I mentioned, for instance, would give taxpayer dollars to parents who choose to opt out of public schools for private schools or even home-schooling.
The culture war that conservatives are currently waging over education is, like the culture wars in other areas of American society, a cover for a more material and ideological agenda. The screaming over "wokeness" and "D.E.I." is just another Trojan horse for a relentless effort to dismantle a pillar of American democracy that, for all of its flaws, is still one of the country's most powerful engines for economic and social mobility.
Ultimately, then, the "parents' rights" movement is not about parents at all; it's about whether this country will continue to strive for a more equitable and democratic system of education, or whether we'll let a reactionary minority drag us as far from that goal as possible, in favor of something even more unequal and hierarchical than what we already have.

Head Over Heels, With or Without Somersaults: [Society Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Caitlin Reichel and Kristy Graziano met at a holiday party in Orlando, Fla., in 2016, but it would take three more years to become a couple.
Caitlin Skye Reichel was doing handstands at a corporate holiday party in Orlando, Fla., the first time Kristy Marie Graziano laid eyes on her.
It was not unusual for Ms. Graziano to see circus professionals balancing upside down on their hands or forearms -- after all, she's one herself, and on that evening in November 2016, she was managing the entertainment for the event. But somehow Ms. Reichel stood out.
"I didn't know anything about her, but I wanted to be her friend," Ms. Graziano said.
The two had a brief conversation that evening, and Ms. Graziano even entered her digits into Ms. Reichel's phone. Ms. Reichel was dating someone then, so the phone number went unused.
Fast forward three years. In December 2019, it occurred to their mutual friend and fellow acrobat, Joshua Johnson, that they might be a good match.
"They are both phenomenal performers," Mr. Johnson said. "It's difficult for performers to match with non-performers, because even when not working, we still have to train, and few understand how much that imposes on our social lives."
Plus, he added, "Kristy tends to be earnest and Caitlin more whimsical. I thought they would be able to balance each other and could grow together."
When he told each about the other, including the fact that both are queer, Ms. Graziano wasted no time and sent Ms. Reichel a friend request on Facebook. But Ms. Reichel barely uses the social media platform. Mr. Johnson had to tell her to check her account.
Ms. Reichel, 29, spent the early years of her life traveling around the country and in Canada with the circus, until her Dominican-American mother, Mary Reichel, and Jewish father, Steven Reichel, established a home base in Orlando just before her ninth birthday. They were clowns in the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, among other circuses. (Her mother still performs independently with fire; her father retired from performing and now works in construction.)
Ms. Reichel started training in acrobatics as a child, and studied classical ballet as a teen. Her specialty is spinning up to 30 hula hoops at a time on various body parts, or fewer while on pointe, juggling several hoops while doing splits and more. Her stage name is Caitlin Skye, and in addition to performing, she coaches and teaches circus arts independently, and just started working with Cirque du Soleil in Orlando in the props crew.
Ms. Graziano, 35, is an aerial performer, specializing in aerial silks and duo trapeze, performing most often with a partner as Duo Dames. Originally from Paducah, Ky., she has an associate degree in graphic design and commercial art from Nossi College of Art in Nashville.
She was introduced to circus arts while working in the costume department at Walt Disney World Resort. A colleague there had invited her to join her at a class, and she took to it immediately. She, too, coaches and works in the rigging department for Cirque du Soleil.
Their Facebook messenger chats soon turned to phone calls. When Ms. Graziano gave her phone number to Ms. Reichel, she realized she already had it in her phone.
Before going on a date, Ms. Reichel took Ms. Graziano's aerial class in February 2020. While Ms. Graziano invited Ms. Reichel to stay after to watch her and her partner rehearse, neither knew it would be another two hours before she finished, around 11:30 p.m.
When they walked to their cars afterward, they each saw that the other drove a Mini Cooper, which Ms. Graziano took as a sign.
"She stayed that whole time just to have a couple minutes with me," Ms. Graziano said. "Later, I called my trapeze partner and said, 'That was really big. I like her so much."'
While their training and performing schedules didn't allow for a proper date for a bit longer, each visited the other at practice. It was on one of those visits that they shared their first kiss.
They went to a horror movie for their first date: "Gretel & Hansel."
Successive dates took place at Universal CityWalk, part of Universal Orlando, and picnicking at a local cemetery. Ms. Reichel, in particular, likes cemeteries because they are peaceful, well-kept places; in Orlando, there are few places free of tourists. Also, she said, "because people are there to be with their loved ones."
By the time everything shut down for Covid in early 2020, including their work, they considered themselves a couple.
Dates now consisted of elaborate meals at home in Orlando and craft nights. One night, Ms. Graziano brought soup to a sick Ms. Reichel. They put their favorite movie on, "It," and Ms. Reichel fell asleep on Ms. Graziano. She had never before felt so comfortable that she had fallen asleep on someone, she said.
Ms. Graziano said she "just wanted to keep holding her" even though her arm was cramping.
Though they spent much of their free time together, they didn't want to rush their relationship.
There was their age gap, and the fact that Ms. Reichel had less relationship experience. But by this point each knew she was in love.
"I was not overly emotional or sensitive before. I was a little cold," Ms. Reichel said. "Kristy warmed my heart and showed me how to really love. She taught me how to love her, but also how to love my family and friends better."
"In my past relationships, I had lost the ability to laugh and have fun, and I laugh with Caitlin every day," Ms. Graziano said. "Caitlin is so talented and I admire her dedication so much, and I do the same for her."
While combining a ground act with an aerial act isn't simple, the couple are thinking about a duo act they can perform together. (Ms. Reichel often does poi spinning with her mother.)
In August 2021, Ms. Graziano moved into Ms. Reichel's house in Orlando, where she lived with her terrier mutt, Samantha.
In October 2021, both women were hired to dress as fairies at a "Pirates of the Caribbean"-themed wedding at Paradise Cove, and to interact with the guests and be part of the bridal party, even though they didn't know the couple. They both realized they could envision their own wedding at the venue, largely since it satisfied one of their requirements: There was space for a trapeze rig.
Ms. Graziano then got the Reichels' blessing to marry their daughter. She then planned a trip to Las Vegas in November 2021. Ms. Reichel got her nails done in anticipation.
But despite Ms. Reichel's mother's regular texts to Ms. Graziano asking if it had happened yet, the proposal would have to wait, as Vegas wasn't exactly the romantic backdrop Ms. Graziano was hoping for.
"Someone was throwing up in a corner, men were handing out fliers with naked women," Ms. Graziano said. "It was gross." They cut their stay short there and headed to the Grand Canyon. Days after they returned, at the Reichels' house, Ms. Graziano put the aquamarine ring in a mesh bag tied to Samantha's collar. When Ms. Reichel spotted it, Ms. Graziano got down on one knee.
"I had that ring for a year and a half before I asked," Ms. Graziano said. "I waited until I knew this is what Caitlin wanted."
Ms. Reichel wanted to propose as well. She bought a ring similar to the one Ms. Graziano had chosen, though with an alexandrite stone, and proposed at her parents' house as well, on her own birthday in March 2022.

They were married in front of 92 guests on Feb. 16 at Paradise Cove in Orlando by Ms. Reichel's sister, Amy Wright, who was ordained by the Universal Life Church for the occasion. Both wore bridal gowns with long trains. Ms. Reichel was walked down the aisle by her father, while Ms. Graziano, who is taking Ms. Reichel's name, was escorted by her older sister, Bobbi Billow.
"Seeing my sister not only being overwhelmingly loved by her bride, but also being embraced into a family who loves and accepts her, brought me to uncontrollable tears," Ms. Billow said.
Both women wrote their own vows, which, unbeknown to them beforehand, referenced "The Addams Family."
"I promise to love you fiercely and irrationally like the most romantic couple ever portrayed, Gomez and Morticia," Ms. Graziano said, while Ms. Reichel said, "You're the Morticia to my Gomez, but with better arms."
At the reception, there were performances from the Duo Rose trapeze act, who are close friends of the couple, as well as Ms. Graziano's trainers.
And then, in the "Don't Say Gay" state, not only did their queer community show up with pride flags and other accouterments to bring a queer club atmosphere to the dance floor, but two drag queens, Chavela Belleza and Mr Ms Adrien, performed.
Ms. Reichel told their guests, "Being at our wedding shows you choose love in a world full of hate; you're proving you have love in your heart."

Ways to Save When Taking A Family Trip: [SpecialSections]

Full text: Like everything else these days, the cost of a family vacation is rising. With spring break season upon us, here's how to keep costs under control.
In the seasonal surge to the skies and roads, spring break promises a recharge -- and a financial pinch. That's especially true this year, when flight prices are up 20 percent compared with last March and April, according to the travel booking app Hopper, and hotels in the United States are averaging $ 316 a night, up 64 percent in the same time frame.
Naturally, even eager travelers are nervous. A recent study from the nonprofit Family Travel Association found that while families are keen to travel -- 85 percent of parents said they were very likely to travel with their children in the next year, compared with about 70 percent in 2019 -- budget concerns are top of mind.
"Affordability has always been the No. 1 challenge for families," said Peter Bopp, the director of research for the association, adding that the pandemic's effect on family finances and inflation have heightened that concern.
"Everything is higher," said Lauren Masarik, a travel agent based in Jackson, N.J., who runs Vacations by Lauren.
To help families stretch their vacation budgets, agents, analysts and bloggers offered the following 12 tips for saving money.
1. Budget for travel
Conscientious spending allowed Antonia Grant, a Minnesota-based publicist and writer for the blog Families Love Travel, her husband and 8-year-old to spend a month in Italy last summer. They are planning a similar trip to Scotland this year.
"After our mortgage and groceries, travel is our third budget item," said Ms. Grant, who sets aside roughly 20 percent of the household's budget for travel. She added that the family has one car and "not the best car or biggest house" because "travel is what we prioritize."
2. Start with flights
Flights are often the biggest travel expense, so experts suggest tackling them first.
"A lot of time, instead of saying, 'I'm going to Paris,' I'll start with the flight," said Colleen Lanin, the founder of the family travel blog Travel Mamas.
She has a $ 49-a-year membership with Going (formerly known as Scott's Cheap Flights) that alerts her to inexpensive flights from her selected airports. Based on a sale notification several years ago, her family went to China for $ 450 a person, round-trip from Phoenix.
"I set up price alerts when I get the school calendar," said Kate Williams, the chief communications officer for the travel search platform Kayak and the mother of three boys, referring to a Kayak tracking tool that notifies users when prices drop or rise. Her latest tracked flight recently came down $ 65 a ticket for an April trip to Arizona.
Since many airlines have relaxed penalties for canceling trips and often return the value of a canceled ticket in the form of a flight credit, travelers who find a lower fare after they've booked can cancel and rebook using the flight credit, assuming both reservations are with the same airline.
When hunting for flights, use basic flight-search budget strategies, including searching for alternate airports near your departure and arrival destinations, and using flexible dates to show the lowest fares.
The online travel agency Expedia recommends flying domestically on a Wednesday to save 15 percent on average and booking at least a month out to save 10 percent.
Read the fine print on budget carrier sites. Their ticket prices often don't include things like carry-on bags or seat assignments, as do most fares from larger airlines such as American, Delta and United, except for basic economy fares. Add those fees in when comparing prices.
3. Find alternative destinations
As with flights, be flexible about your destination, advised Lauren Doyle, president of the Travel Mechanic, an agency based in Raleigh, N.C. For savings, she recommends Belize in place of Costa Rica, and St. Lucia over Hawaii.
Consider visiting more popular places during their low seasons. When Mexico beach resorts were expensive last Thanksgiving, Gunjan Prakash, the founder and chief executive of the Families Love Travel blog, and her family went to Paris. This year they plan to go to Porto, Portugal, for Thanksgiving -- another place that is not busy in November -- booking round-trip flights for about $ 300 a person from New York City and a hotel room for four for $ 200 a night.
In summer, when U.S. national parks can be overrun, consider a secondary preserve. The 16,000-acre Harriman State Park in eastern Idaho, for example, lies within the greater Yellowstone ecosystem, and has 22 miles of trails, and rental yurts from $ 82 nightly.
4. Cash in on the dollar's strength
One way to get more for your money is to travel to a country where the dollar is strong. It is currently worth about 0.94 euros; by comparison, it was worth 0.81 euros in early 2021. Mexico and Canada have also recently offered favorable exchange rates, as have countries in Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam.
Mr. Bopp of the Family Travel Association noted that closer destinations "make a lot of sense because it's not expensive to get there." Asia may have some great deals, he said, but "it's expensive to fly there."
Mexico, of course, is among the closer international destinations for U.S. travelers, but it has experienced a recent wave of violence that is deterring some travelers. Still, it was the top international destination in the Americas among families, according to the association's 2022 survey. Be sure to check the U.S. State Department's detailed travel advisory when planning a trip.
5. Save on city stays
Full-service hotels in some big cities such as San Francisco and Washington have not fully recovered from the pandemic crash, which might yield some deals, according to Jan Freitag, the national director of hospitality analytics at CoStar, a real estate analytics firm.
"Be aware of the meeting calendar," when hotels are likely to attract business travelers, he added.
Scrimp on urban accommodations if you're unlikely to spend a lot of time in the room.
"The key is a good location to walk to places, but you're just crashing," said Ms. Prakash, who, instead of staying in an expensive hotel, rented a bargain two-bedroom Airbnb in Rome last April for $ 100 a night.
6. Book family rooms
Finding spacious rooms suitable for the entire family takes some digging. The booking site Hotels.com has a "family friendly" filter to identify properties with multiple rooms and amenities for kids like clubs or child care.
Or consider a hostel. Design-focused groups like Generator, with 15 locations mostly in Europe, and Freehand, in four U.S. cities, have rooms with multiple beds that families can book privately. The Freehand Chicago recently had rooms with four beds from about $ 145 and the Generator London offered them from about $ 234.
The more basic a&o Hostels have family rooms with up to eight beds among its 40 European locations. A recent search for a quad family room in Vienna turned up a rate of about $ 30 a person.
7. Rent a vacation home
Since the pandemic began, travelers have embraced home rentals for privacy and space. Airbnb said its family business has grown 60 percent compared with 2019, with the average price per person on family stays globally at $ 52 a night.
In a recent survey of 1,000 Americans commissioned by the short-term rental service Vacasa, 65 percent of respondents said renting homes offered the best value. The service identified its best domestic bargains in Myrtle Beach, S.C. (around $ 104 a bedroom per night, including rentals with multiple bedrooms), and the Great Smoky Mountains ( $ 116).
Travel between April and early June to get prices averaging 20 percent less than summer rates, according to the rental platform HometoGo. On Vrbo, filters for a "weekly discount" and "new listing discount" help renters find deals on the site.
Check GetawayGoGo for last-minute deals. The new platform, which is working with more than 46,000 properties in 39 countries, offers sales on vacation home rentals available up to 14 days in advance. Recent listings included an eight-bedroom villa in the Dominican Republic at 34 percent off for $ 300 a night.
8. Invest in travel perks
Rob Taylor, a co-founder of the L.G.B.T.Q. travel blog 2TravelDads and the father of two children, uses the American Express Platinum Card, which has an annual fee of $ 695, to gain access to airport lounges with complimentary food and drink.
"If you have lunch at the airport for four, plus adult drinks by the time you board, you've spent $ 150. In one trip that's $ 300," he said. "A family of four or five can recover the cost in two trips."
9. Cruise without the views
Historically, a Caribbean cruise was about half the price of seeing the region by land, according to Ms. Masarik, the travel agent. But ship business is booming and the cruise lines are not giving as much away in deals.
"The best way to save on a cruise is going on an older, smaller ship," she said. "You can do a smaller ship with fewer bells and whistles for a third of the price of a new ship."
Another way to save money on a family cruise is to book an interior cabin, instead of an ocean view room. Over Christmas, Ms. Lanin of Travel Mamas and eight other family members took a Caribbean cruise.
"If you want to save money, you don't need a room with a balcony because you're never in the room," she said.
10. Rent a tent
Spending time in the great outdoors doesn't require a huge investment. Services like Arrive Outdoors and OutdoorsGeek allow occasional campers to rent gear. Instead of spending more than $ 200 on a high-quality, four-person tent, OutdoorsGeek rents North Face models for $ 49 for up to three days, or $ 62 for a week.
Glamping sites with platform tents often have high rates. But the affordable French company Huttopia operates more than 60 sites globally and recently made its North American debut with sites in Quebec, New Hampshire, Maine, New York and Southern California. Canvas-and-wood tents with kitchens and accommodations for up to five people start at $ 140 a night.
"We are working to make this easily accessible in price, but also accessible for families who don't know how to camp yet, don't have the equipment, and want to do it in a safe and accessible environment to educate their children," said Margaux Bossanne, the business development manager at Huttopia.
11. Avoid theme park pitfalls
For theme park vacations, "I always tell people don't put money into your hotel because you're never there," Ms. Masarik said. Instead, opt for cheaper accommodations with easy access to the park.
For instance, in Florida, Disney World resorts like Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge start above $ 500 in early April, while the nearby Caribe Royale Orlando has rates from about $ 200, including shuttles to the parks. Buy advance park admission from BestofOrlando.com, run by the local tourism office, to get discounts. Recently SeaWorld Orlando tickets were selling for about $ 100 a person, compared with nearly $ 148 at the gate.
For some parks, a season pass can be a better deal than paying a daily rate. At Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tenn., season passes start at $ 164, compared with $ 89 by the day, worth it if you spend two days at the park.
12. Spend selectively and nearby
Economize on food by eating breakfast in your room or rental and packing picnic lunches. "In the evening, you're tired and ready to have someone serve you, so we do restaurants at dinner," Ms. Lanin of Travel Mamas said.
Get creative with souvenirs. Instead of buying $ 25 T-shirts at each stop, Ms. Lanin suggested having children select a postcard from each gift shop, then writing about their experiences and mailing them to relive the trip back home.
Finally, you don't have to go far to be exposed to new things and to bond.
"Emphasize the experience of the journey," Ms. Grant of Families Love Travel said. "When it comes to traveling, the most important part is making memories and you can do that close to home."

In the seasonal surge to the skies and roads, spring break promises a recharge — and a financial pinch. That’s especially true this year, when flight prices are up 20% compared with last March and April, according to travel booking app Hopper, and hotels in the United States are averaging $316 a night, up 64% in the same time frame.
Naturally, even eager travelers are nervous. A recent study from the nonprofit Family Travel Association found that while families are keen to travel — 85% of parents said they were very likely to travel with their children in the next year, compared with about 70% in 2019 — budget concerns are top of mind.
“Affordability has always been the No. 1 challenge for families,” said Peter Bopp, the director of research for the association, adding that the pandemic’s effect on family finances and inflation have heightened that concern.
“Everything is higher,” said Lauren Masarik, a travel agent based in Jackson, New Jersey, who runs Vacations by Lauren.
To help families stretch their vacation budgets, agents, analysts and bloggers offered the following 12 tips for saving money.
1. Budget for travel
Conscientious spending allowed Antonia Grant, a Minnesota-based publicist and writer for the blog Families Love Travel, her husband and 8-year-old to spend a month in Italy last summer. They are planning a similar trip to Scotland this year.
“After our mortgage and groceries, travel is our third budget item,” said Grant, who sets aside roughly 20% of the household’s budget for travel. She added that the family has one car and “not the best car or biggest house” because “travel is what we prioritize.”
2. Start with flights
Flights are often the biggest travel expense, so experts suggest tackling them first.
“A lot of time, instead of saying, ‘I’m going to Paris,’ I’ll start with the flight,” said Colleen Lanin, the founder of family travel blog Travel Mamas.
She has a $49-a-year membership with Going (formerly known as Scott’s Cheap Flights) that alerts her to inexpensive flights from her selected airports. Based on a sale notification several years ago, her family went to China for $450 a person, round-trip from Phoenix.
“I set up price alerts when I get the school calendar,” said Kate Williams, the chief communications officer for travel search platform Kayak and the mother of three boys, referring to a Kayak tracking tool that notifies users when prices drop or rise. Her latest tracked flight recently came down $65 a ticket for an April trip to Arizona.
Since many airlines have relaxed penalties for canceling trips and often return the value of a canceled ticket in the form of a flight credit, travelers who find a lower fare after they’ve booked can cancel and rebook using the flight credit, assuming both reservations are with the same airline.
When hunting for flights, use basic flight search budget strategies, including searching for alternate airports near your departure and arrival destinations, and using flexible dates to show the lowest fares.
Online travel agency Expedia recommends flying domestically on a Wednesday to save 15% on average and booking at least a month out to save 10%.
Read the fine print on budget carrier sites. Their ticket prices often don’t include things like carry-on bags or seat assignments, as do most fares from larger airlines such as American, Delta and United, except for basic economy fares. Add those fees in when comparing prices.
3. Find alternative destinations
As with flights, be flexible about your destination, advised Lauren Doyle, president of the Travel Mechanic, an agency based in Raleigh, North Carolina. For savings, she recommends Belize in place of Costa Rica, and St. Lucia over Hawaii.
Consider visiting more popular places during their low seasons. When Mexico beach resorts were expensive last Thanksgiving, Gunjan Prakash, the founder and CEO of the Families Love Travel blog, and her family went to Paris. This year they plan to go to Porto, Portugal, for Thanksgiving — another place that is not busy in November — booking round-trip flights for about $300 a person from New York City and a hotel room for four for $200 a night.
In summer, when U.S. national parks can be overrun, consider a secondary preserve. The 16,000-acre Harriman State Park in eastern Idaho, for example, lies within the greater Yellowstone ecosystem, and has 22 miles of trails, and rental yurts from $82 nightly.
4. Cash in on the dollar’s strength
One way to get more for your money is to travel to a country where the dollar is strong. It is currently worth about 0.94 euros; by comparison, it was worth 0.81 euros in early 2021. Mexico and Canada have also recently offered favorable exchange rates, as have countries in Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam.
Bopp of the Family Travel Association noted that closer destinations “make a lot of sense because it’s not expensive to get there.” Asia may have some great deals, he said, but “it’s expensive to fly there.”
Mexico, of course, is among the closer international destinations for U.S. travelers, but it has experienced a recent wave of violence that is deterring some travelers. Still, it was the top international destination in the Americas among families, according to the association’s 2022 survey. Be sure to check the State Department’s detailed travel advisory when planning a trip.
5. Save on city stays
Full-service hotels in some big cities such as San Francisco and Washington have not fully recovered from the pandemic crash, which might yield some deals, according to Jan Freitag, the national director of hospitality analytics at CoStar, a real estate analytics firm.
“Be aware of the meeting calendar,” when hotels are likely to attract business travelers, he added.
Scrimp on urban accommodations if you’re unlikely to spend a lot of time in the room.
“The key is a good location to walk to places, but you’re just crashing,” said Prakash, who, instead of staying in an expensive hotel, rented a bargain two-bedroom Airbnb in Rome last April for $100 a night.
6. Book family rooms
Finding spacious rooms suitable for the entire family takes some digging. Booking site Hotels.com has a “family friendly” filter to identify properties with multiple rooms and amenities for kids like clubs or child care.
Or consider a hostel. Design-focused groups like Generator, with 15 locations mostly in Europe, and Freehand, in four U.S. cities, have rooms with multiple beds that families can book privately. The Freehand Chicago recently had rooms with four beds from about $145 and the Generator London offered them from about $234.
The more basic a&o Hostels have family rooms with up to eight beds among its 40 European locations. A recent search for a quad family room in Vienna turned up a rate of about $30 a person.
7. Rent a vacation home
Since the pandemic began, travelers have embraced home rentals for privacy and space. Airbnb said its family business has grown 60% compared with 2019, with the average price per person on family stays globally at $52 a night.
In a recent survey of 1,000 Americans commissioned by short-term rental service Vacasa, 65% of respondents said renting homes offered the best value. The service identified its best domestic bargains in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, (around $104 a bedroom per night, including rentals with multiple bedrooms), and the Great Smoky Mountains ($116).
Travel between April and early June to get prices averaging 20% less than summer rates, according to rental platform HometoGo. On Vrbo, filters for a “weekly discount” and “new listing discount” help renters find deals on the site.
Check GetawayGoGo for last-minute deals. The new platform, which is working with more than 46,000 properties in 39 countries, offers sales on vacation home rentals available up to 14 days in advance. Recent listings included an eight-bedroom villa in the Dominican Republic at 34% off for $300 a night.
8. Invest in travel perks
Rob Taylor, a co-founder of LGBTQ travel blog 2TravelDads and the father of two children, uses the American Express Platinum Card, which has an annual fee of $695, to gain access to airport lounges with complimentary food and drink.
“If you have lunch at the airport for four, plus adult drinks by the time you board, you’ve spent $150. In one trip that’s $300,” he said. “A family of four or five can recover the cost in two trips.”
9. Cruise without the views
Historically, a Caribbean cruise was about half the price of seeing the region by land, according to Masarik, the travel agent. But ship business is booming and the cruise lines are not giving as much away in deals.
“The best way to save on a cruise is going on an older, smaller ship,” she said. “You can do a smaller ship with fewer bells and whistles for a third of the price of a new ship.”
Another way to save money on a family cruise is to book an interior cabin, instead of an ocean view room. Over Christmas, Lanin of Travel Mamas and eight other family members took a Caribbean cruise.
“If you want to save money, you don’t need a room with a balcony because you’re never in the room,” she said.
10. Rent a tent
Spending time in the great outdoors doesn’t require a huge investment. Services like Arrive Outdoors and OutdoorsGeek allow occasional campers to rent gear. Instead of spending more than $200 on a high-quality, four-person tent, OutdoorsGeek rents North Face models for $49 for up to three days, or $62 for a week.
Glamping sites with platform tents often have high rates. But affordable French company Huttopia operates more than 60 sites globally and recently made its North American debut with sites in Quebec, New Hampshire, Maine, New York and Southern California. Canvas-and-wood tents with kitchens and accommodations for up to five people start at $140 a night.
“We are working to make this easily accessible in price, but also accessible for families who don’t know how to camp yet, don’t have the equipment, and want to do it in a safe and accessible environment to educate their children,” said Margaux Bossanne, the business development manager at Huttopia.
11. Avoid theme park pitfalls
For theme park vacations, “I always tell people don’t put money into your hotel because you’re never there,” Masarik said. Instead, opt for cheaper accommodations with easy access to the park.
For instance, in Florida, Disney World resorts like Disney’s Animal Kingdom Lodge start above $500 in early April, while the nearby Caribe Royale Orlando has rates from about $200, including shuttles to the parks. Buy advance park admission from BestofOrlando.com, run by the local tourism office, to get discounts. Recently, SeaWorld Orlando tickets were selling for about $100 a person, compared with nearly $148 at the gate.
For some parks, a season pass can be a better deal than paying a daily rate. At Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, season passes start at $164, compared with $89 by the day, worth it if you spend two days at the park.
12. Spend selectively and nearby
Economize on food by eating breakfast in your room or rental and packing picnic lunches. “In the evening, you’re tired and ready to have someone serve you, so we do restaurants at dinner,” Lanin of Travel Mamas said.
Get creative with souvenirs. Instead of buying $25 T-shirts at each stop, Lanin suggested having children select a postcard from each gift shop, then writing about their experiences and mailing them to relive the trip back home.
Finally, you don’t have to go far to be exposed to new things and to bond.
“Emphasize the experience of the journey,” Grant of Families Love Travel said. “When it comes to traveling, the most important part is making memories, and you can do that close to home.”

Florida Atlantic Makes 'Winning in Paradise' More Than Just a Motto: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Florida Atlantic has seemingly come out of nowhere to make a deep run in the men's N.C.A.A. tournament. The university's ambitions are relatively young, too.
HOUSTON -- David Vanterpool has played professional basketball in Italy, China, and Russia and coached in the N.B.A., yet even he was surprised on his first visit to Florida Atlantic University.
Vanterpool, who most recently served as an assistant coach with the Nets during the 2021-22 season, first set foot on the school's 850-acre, palm-tree lined campus in Boca Raton, Fla., in January. He was on a recruiting visit with his son, Devin, a guard who is getting ready to graduate high school. It was a balmy 85 degrees, and they stayed at a nearby beachside hotel. ("Winning in paradise" is the school's marketing tagline, and "1.8 miles to the beach" is stamped on its arena floor.)
"I asked if they could add me to the scholarship they offered my son and put me in some masters courses or something like that," Vanterpool joked.
Devin Vanterpool ended up verbally committing to Florida Atlantic on March 12, one day after the Owls won the Conference USA tournament, which earned them an automatic bid to the men's N.C.A.A. tournament. A few days later, Florida Atlantic started its current run of four wins in the national tournament to reach the Final Four. On Saturday night, the No. 9 seed Owls will meet No. 5-seeded San Diego State in a national semifinal, with the winner facing either Connecticut or Miami on Monday for the championship.
The Vanterpools had a leg up on many others when it came to their familiarity with Florida Atlantic, a university many people had never heard of beyond a line in a March Madness bracket challenge. (Some basics: The team is named the Owls because the main campus is an owl sanctuary. It also sits on the former Boca Raton Army Air Field, which was used in World War II for radar training, well before the university officially opened in 1964.)
Florida Atlantic's deep tournament run this year seemed to come out of nowhere. The team had only one previous tournament appearance, yet it has won 11 straight games.
"We describe the university a lot as an upstart stock," said Brian White, Florida Atlantic's athletic director. "It's crazy how young we are, not only as an athletic department, but as a university."
White said one area that the university had been developing in was its housing, with two new dorms that have been filled and a need for more.
"We had 300-plus kids living at the Fairfield Inn last year because we couldn't quite house them on campus, so the demand is already high," he said. "And with this basketball run, it's going to go through the roof."
White traces the rise of the athletic program to the school's decision to hire Howard Schnellenberger as its director of football operations in 1998 and later as its football coach. He had previously led Miami to a national championship in 1983, coached at Louisville and Oklahoma and also was the head coach of the Baltimore Colts in the early 1970s.
Schnellenberger raised $ 13 million in pledges, lobbied state lawmakers for support and coined the phrase "football in paradise" as a recruiting tool.
Jim Rosemurgy, who attended the University of Wisconsin as an undergraduate and then the University of California, Berkeley, for graduate school, moved to Boca Raton in 1970 and has been a prominent booster for Florida Atlantic ever since.
He said the school made a decision around the time he arrived to invest in sports as a way to enhance its overall profile and draw more applicants from out of state.
"They wanted to be a top-tier university," he said. "They decided that sports had to be part of that mission."
Florida Atlantic is less known for its athletic achievements than for being a last-chance saloon for coaches: Schnellenberger, Lane Kiffin, Willie Taggart and Tom Herman in football, and Mike Jarvis and Matt Doherty in basketball.
The work in progress has included some needed improvements to the facilities. Dusty May, Florida Atlantic's coach, said that after he accepted the job in 2018, he immediately felt some regret after seeing where the team would work.
An assistant coach, Todd Abernethy, said that among other improvements, the team used a $ 3 million donation to turn a yoga studio that had been unused during the coronavirus pandemic into an informal practice space, calling it "The Bubble" after the N.B.A.'s decision to finish its 2020 season at Walt Disney World.
The converted studio is not a full court, but it is a place to get up shots. The space consists of two baskets with 3-point arcs and another two baskets with free-throw lines.
"The funniest thing is 'The Bubble' is right above Dusty's office," Abernathy said. "And so it sounds like elephants are on top of us. When he's there early in the morning, and somebody's pounding, we'll say, 'Hey, go to the other basket, if you don't mind."'
White said he had extended May's contract multiple times already, and that he wanted to do so again after this run.
"I'd be crazy if I wasn't going to give him a really good extension after this year," White said.
May's name has been linked to bigger jobs, though many of the high-major openings have already been filled during Florida Atlantic's run. Next season, the university will move to the American Athletic Conference.
"I learned a long time ago you never mess with happy," May said on Friday. "At this point in my career, I couldn't be any more pleased and happy with where we are and just excited to continue building."
This week, some of the Owls players shot outdoors close to the beach, Abernethy said, to get used to the depth perception issues that come when playing in a football arena, where the baskets have a significant amount of space behind them and the players compete on an elevated floor.
It was the latest chapter in what has been a season-long embrace of beach culture for the Owls.
"We call ourselves the Beach Boys," said Brandon Weatherspoon, a guard who transferred from a junior college. "Earlier this year when we were playing Western Kentucky, they said we were the beach boys, calling us soft."
Then, he explained, "We just took it and ran with it."
Weatherspoon said that arriving in Houston for the Final Four had helped the players realize the significance of their run.
"Ten, 15 years from now we'll come back to Boca knowing we've been to the Final Four," he said.
"When we first started," he added, "this wasn't a goal."

Full text: In "Tao of Glass," Phelim McDermott, who has directed three Glass operas, turns to his personal history with the composer's work.
The first piece of theater that Phelim McDermott made after college, decades ago, used music by Philip Glass. And directing productions of three of Glass's operas has brought McDermott -- and Improbable, the theater company he helped found in 1996 -- glowing reviews and sold-out houses.
So it's not surprising that McDermott's "Tao of Glass," which arrives at the NYU Skirball on Thursday, is a loving tribute to his long relationship -- what, in an interview, he called "my obsession" -- with Glass's seemingly repetitive yet constantly transforming music.
"Philip's music has been like this river that's gone through my creative life," McDermott said on a video call from London, where he was completing rehearsals for a revival of his juggling-heavy production of Glass's "Akhnaten" at English National Opera. "It connects me to a part of myself that sometimes I neglect and have forgotten about. It's like an invitation to return to myself."
Improbable's productions tend to be built from everyday stuff, but "Tao of Glass" is even more modest than most. It is essentially a one-man show for McDermott. (Glass doesn't perform live in the piece, but is present in ghostly form through a sophisticated player piano that plays back precisely what he put down on it, including every detail of touch and phrasing.)
Onstage, McDermott is surrounded by shadow play, sticky tape and creatures formed from tissue paper as he tells stories about his life; his history with Glass, both the work and the man; his experiences in meditation-encouraging flotation tanks; and his encounters with the writings of Lao Tzu, the open-minded principle of "deep democracy" espoused by the author and therapist Arnold Mindell, and a shattered coffee table made of, yes, glass.
In the interview, McDermott talked more about his relationship with Glass and how the show came together. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Talk about the roots of your relationship with Glass's work.
I was at college in London, what was then Middlesex Polytechnic, and I became very obsessed with his music. This was in 1982 or '83, and I would take out VHS tapes of him playing with the Glass Ensemble, and footage of the operas and so on. And then, in the last six weeks of my degree course, I made an adaptation of an Ian McEwan short story, "Conversation With a Cupboard Man."
It was a monologue about a guy who lives in what, in the U.K., we call a wardrobe -- quite a dark, sort of strange piece about this guy who's a misfit. And Philip's music from "Glassworks" was so appropriate to that piece. It became the music we used in the show.
And when did you take on one of the operas?
I was approached by John Berry at English National Opera. It was 2005, and I was performing a show called "Spirit" at New York Theater Workshop, literally around the corner from where Philip lives, and he met me at Atlas Cafe. I'd been asked to do "Einstein on the Beach," and I thought it was a stupid idea. Philip asked me, "Why do you want to do 'Einstein'?" And I said, "I don't." So we talked a bit, and he said, "Your genuine reluctance to do this piece makes me think you should do it."
But then he mentioned "Satyagraha." And I went away and listened to it, and it's not a bio-opera about Gandhi; it's about a concept. I got excited by this idea of collective social activism, of big groups of people and how they can exchange ideas. And it resonated with Arnold Mindell's "worldwork": If you want to do social activism and change, you have to work on yourself. If there's an outer conflict, you also have to work on that conflict within yourself. That idea of "deep democracy" is in "Tao of Glass."
Your stagings of "Satyagraha," "Akhnaten" and "The Perfect American" have different unifying concepts.
With "Satyagraha," which we first did in 2007, it was big-scale spectacle, but using humble materials: sticky tape, newspaper -- building those into large-scale puppetry. That became a model or metaphor for how, collectively, you can create something powerful even with humble materials. For "The Perfect American" (2013), which is about Walt Disney, it was about animation, and about all the work that goes into it between every frame. And for "Akhnaten" (2016), about the Egyptian pharaoh, it was juggling -- and it turned out the very first image of juggling is in an ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic.
How did "Tao of Glass" come about?
It's a show that happened when another one didn't, which I talk about in "Tao of Glass." Philip and I were supposed to adapt Maurice Sendak's "In the Night Kitchen." I'd come out to New York; I'd done a storyboard and what musical bits might happen; but Maurice's sad death, in 2012, meant that project veered into not happening.
John McGrath at the Manchester International Festival said even if that project's not happening, if I was to dream what I might make with Philip, what might that be? And I got a vision, floating in the flotation tank, of me and Philip onstage together. I went to Philip and said, "I have a vision: I'm doing the puppetry, and you're at the piano." And he never said no.
Part of the story is my dream of getting him back into a rehearsal room the way I imagine he did when he was just starting out, just a downtown rehearsal space and some musicians. And it happened: There was this week where Philip did come into the rehearsal room, and I told stories -- about him, about Taoism, about Arnie Mindell -- and he would riff, and then he went away and arranged those bits of music he'd played. And, in a way, the show made itself. In the breaks, he would take us to a Tibetan curry house where they all knew him. It was Philip having a good time, really.
They say don't meet your heroes, but I did, and I ended up making a crazy show with him that's one of the things I'm proudest of. When you're making a show like this, you have to trust something, and what you end up trusting is just doing the next step and the next step and the next step. And that's what Philip's music does. People say it's repetitive, but it's not really repetitive. It's cyclical and it changes, and you get to a place where you don't know how you got there, a deeper place.
What comes next for you and him?
The last time I saw Philip -- we always have a little conversation about what happens next, and he said, "When we work together, it seems to go quite well." And at the moment we're talking again about "Einstein," to complete the trilogy with "Satyagraha" and "Akhnaten."
There's probably vocabularies from those other productions that will go into our version of "Einstein" -- probably a new vocabulary, too, but also elements of those other productions. When we met, he talked about various things, but the thing he's most excited about is the trilogy: that we've got to do our Improbable version of "Einstein," so that we can do all three operas across a city at the same time.
He's a bit slow now, but he said, "You've got me all fired up." So I know that that's what Philip wants to happen -- and I'm saying that publicly so that it does. That's how you make things happen.

Full text: The country star's hit-stuffed streaming blockbuster is just shy of one million equivalent sales. U2 opens at No. 5 with an album of acoustic rerecordings.
Morgan Wallen is not budging from No. 1 on the Billboard album chart, with the country star's latest hit-stuffed double album holding the top spot for a third week in a row.
Wallen's 36-track "One Thing at a Time" racked up the equivalent of another 209,500 sales in the United States, according to the tracking service Luminate, bringing its three-week total to just shy of one million. In its most recent week, it had 256 million streams and sold 12,500 copies as a complete package.
Two years ago, Wallen's last release, "Dangerous: The Double Album," spent its first 10 weeks at No. 1, even amid a media controversy and temporary radio ban after Wallen was caught on video using a racial slur. Can "One Thing at a Time" match the success of its predecessor? That album's success, by the way, is ongoing; this week "Dangerous" holds at No. 7, logging its 112th week in the Top 10.
Also this week, SZA's "SOS" climbs two spots to No. 2, and Taylor Swift's "Midnights" rises three to No. 3; both are former No. 1s that got boosts from their creators being on tour. Miley Cyrus's "Endless Summer Vacation" is No. 4.
U2, the veteran Irish rock band, is No. 5 with "Songs of Surrender," a retrospective project of mostly acoustic rerecordings of some of the group's signature songs. It arrived with the promotion of a Disney+ documentary and the recent announcement of a concert residency this fall at a high-tech new venue in Las Vegas, the MSG Sphere.
The most complete form of "Songs of Surrender" -- standard on streaming services, and a "super deluxe" four-LP doorstopper -- includes 40 songs over nearly three hours. The album opens with the equivalent of 46,500 sales, mostly from copies sold as a complete package.

Blood, Toil, Tears and Sweat at an Old Manor: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: Tim Soar stood in the oak-paneled drawing room of his 12th-century English manor house, known as Long Crendon Manor, fretting as the heat from the crackling fire escaped out of a door left ajar.
"Close the door! The heat! We need to conserve the heat," Mr. Soar yelled.
He was leading a reporter on a private tour of this massive relic in the Buckinghamshire countryside, about 50 miles northwest of London, which he and his wife, Sue Soar, recently listed for sale. Stepping inside from the courtyard, there was silence except for the tick-tock of the antique grandfather clock in the great hall. The hulking cream-and-gray flagstones underfoot had been worn away from centuries of service.
From the east wing, which was added in the 14th century, to the west wing, which arrived in the 15th century, this 39-acre property envelops visitors in a millennium of history, and looks every bit its age. And if it looks familiar, maybe it's because you've seen it in various films and television shows going back decades, from 1933's "The Private Life of Henry VIII" to 2012's "The Woman in Black," starring Daniel Radcliffe. (Also, one of its previous owners was Sir Winston Churchill's father.)
Medieval properties for sale like Long Crendon are exceedingly out of the ordinary, even among the historic estates that dot this rural part of England, said Ed Sugden, a broker and country-house specialist with Savills. He has listed the property at a guide price of 6.95 million British pounds ( $ 8.4 million), which includes its thatched summer house, a winter house with a fireplace, a hedge maze with a central fountain, a croquet lawn and plenty more.
"We have other manor houses on the market," Mr. Sugden said, "but nothing medieval. It's a pretty rare property. It's fair to say that it's a specialized market. Medieval architecture doesn't have such a wide appeal as Georgian architecture -- people like the proportions and the extra light Georgian properties give them. But because of their age, there are far fewer medieval properties available."
The main house at Long Crendon offers 13,500 square feet of living space on two floors, including a dining room, library, two sitting rooms, a butler's pantry, a wine cellar, two kitchens, 10 bedrooms and six bathrooms. There are three boilers and two Wi-Fi systems.
And only two people live here: Mr. Soar, 60, and Ms. Soar, 61.
Ms. Soar's parents bought the property in 1976, and the couple moved in 15 years ago. They've spent much of that time struggling to maintain the sprawling estate, operating a bed-and-breakfast, a farm shop, a cider business, a bakery, a pork store and various other commercial ventures to support its upkeep.
"With the dogs, pigs, geese, chickens, B&B guests, farm shop and everything else, we don't get time to go away together, ever," Mr. Soar said. In four decades, the longest stretch they've managed away from the house was four nights, he said, "and that was our honeymoon."
It wasn't always like this. Before the couple moved into this decaying castle, Mr. Soar lived a "corporate life" as a chartered engineer. "I felt important," he said. "But when I'm on my knees cleaning the fourth bog of the day, I think, 'What has it all come down to?' With houses like these, you have to be very hands-on indeed, unless you're very, very wealthy."
The Soars are not very, very wealthy, which has led to this new chapter in the 835-year history the home. Despite listing it for sale, however, the Soars aren't quite ready to let Long Crendon go.
"The property causes lots of people, both nearby and far, to be rather nosy," Ms. Soar said. "We're always being asked what our plans will be if we sell Long Crendon. Well, we simply don't know."
"But if we did," her husband added, "we'd probably buy something similar, but with five bedrooms and not 10."
The couple's ideal buyer would be a young family who could "bring it back to its former glory," Mr. Sugden said, "rather than going for a commercial venture. They're happy with both options, but would prefer that."
He cautioned that the house "is not turnkey," and that because it is "so unusual," it may take a while to sell. But, he added, "It's a joy to be selling a property with its history."
That history has been recorded at numerous times and in numerous places, including national archives and the local Buckinghamshire Council archives. Long Crendon goes back to about 1187, when the great room housed the Abbots of Notley. It was owned at one point by William Marshal, one of 25 rebellious barons who forced King John to put his seal on the Magna Carta in 1215. Six centuries later, it was owned by three generations of the Dukes of Marlborough, then by Lord Randolph Churchill, father of Sir Winston Churchill.
"It was advertised in the Times for 140,000 pounds when my parents bought it in 1976," Ms. Soar said, referring to the British daily newspaper. "But I think the price is completely irrelevant as they bought it bit by bit, buying the gatehouse first, as that suited the previous owners."
The couple took over Long Crendon and gave up their jobs after Ms. Soar's widowed mother, Celia, became ill. They raised their own children -- Tobias, Oliver and Emma -- in the house. It didn't take long for them to realize what they were up against. Buildings in Britain that have special architectural or historical merit are listed in one of three grades, which limit the alterations that can be made. Long Crendon is a Grade II*.
"When Sue's parents bought the property, it needed a major overhaul -- everything from the plumbing to the roof to the guttering," Mr. Soar said. "For us, as it's a listed building, the maintenance never ends."
A century ago, Mr. Soar said, there would have been a robust staff to help -- there were two butlers, two chauffeurs and two scullery maids. Today there is just a gardener, who visits once a week. "Everything else Sue and I do ourselves," Mr. Soar said.
"Cooking, chambermaiding, maintenance, running the farm shop. And while we don't have employed staff, we have a network of local tradesmen -- roofing, plumbing, French polishing, a limesmith, a cabinet maker," he trailed on with more chores.
He pointed out the leaded glass windows in the library, which he repaired himself. "A couple came to stay as B&B guests and the lady mentioned that she used to repair lead lights for churches and cathedrals," he said. "She gave me a one-day coaching workshop, teaching me how to cut the glass, stretch the lead and solder."
Much of the upkeep is for the benefit of the bed-and-breakfast guests. On internet review sites like booking.com, most Long Crendon guests post positive notes about the house and the hosts. "Incredible stay!" reads one. "Peaceful, beautiful and a B&B like no other I have stayed in," gushes another.
Not everyone, of course. One recent guest complained about the abundant cobwebs, "which is somewhat understandable given the type of accommodation, but did detract from the comfort," they wrote. Another said the house was "very comfortable, but lack of hot water spoilt it for me."
(Ms. Soar's wry wit sometimes earns its own reaction: One guest reported that she said their luggage "looked like a body bag.")
Some people just "have the wrong expectations," Mr. Soar said. "We don't have waiters serving cocktails."
When guests are replaced by film crews looking for authentic medieval ambience, "it is intrusive but lucrative," Mr. Soar said. The last major production to take over the house, he said, was the forthcoming Disney+ series "The Ballad of Renegade Nell," which brought in dozens of extras, as well as carriages, horses, chickens and goats.
"You have to turn a blind eye concerning your property," he said. "If they want to use the drawing room, it will get painted a different color, the fixtures and fittings all go. You can't be precious at all."
When Covid arrived, almost all of the Soars' revenue streams were interrupted. They couldn't even sell their meat and cider to restaurants, which were closed. They managed to keep the farm shop and bakery operating.
The estate also has a licensed cafe, which is run by a neighbor.
"Although we live nearby, we didn't know about the manor at all, so it was a nice surprise," said Robbie Elliott, who began overseeing the cafe with his wife, Rachel, in December. They live in the nearby village of Haddenham, a couple of miles away.
"The manor and the surroundings are stunning, and the local people have been so welcoming. There is a real community vibe here," Mr. Elliot said. "Long Crendon is only a small village, and one or two pubs have closed nearby recently, so people are keen to get a new local business."
The Soars have done their part to support the Long Crendon village by employing local tradespeople and hosting fund-raisers. "They don't Lord it up at all. They're very down to earth," said Derek Smith, a village resident. "They're always very approachable and are an asset to the village."
For years, the couple helped supply the village with meats, ciders and baked goods. These days, there's no baker to run the bakery. The last two, who hailed from Romania and Hungary, had to leave after Britain departed the European Union in 2020.
Ms. Soar still runs the farm shop, and the cider-making operation is churning out 6,000 liters a year, she said. The free-range, rare-breed pigs continue to supply a sausage and bacon business. "You certainly need to have eggs in lots of baskets running an estate," she said. Long Crendon Manor, left, northwest of London, has been featured in films and television shows.

Shattering Glass Ceilings and Slippers: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Andrew Lloyd Webber hopes to extend an unbroken 43-year streak on Broadway. But his 13th new musical may not be the charm.
First: Bring earplugs.
Not just because the songs in "Bad Cinderella," the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical that opened on Thursday at the Imperial Theater, are so crushingly loud. The dialogue, too, would benefit from inaudibility.
For that matter, bring eye plugs: The sets and costumes are as loud as the songs. If there were such a thing as soul plugs, I'd recommend them as well.
That's because "Bad Cinderella" is not the clever, high-spirited revamp you might have expected, casting contemporary fairy dust on the classic story of love and slippers. It has none of the grit of the Grimm tale, the sweetness of the Disney movie or the grace (let alone the melodic delight) of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical. Instead, it's surprisingly vulgar, sexed-up and dumbed-down: a parade of hustling women in bustiers and shirtless pec-rippling hunks.
Finally, a Cinderella for streetwalkers and gym rats!
That this is the supposedly improved version of the musical that opened in London in August 2021 beggars the imagination. Then simply called "Cinderella," and welcomed with indulgent warmth by critics who were perhaps rusty after more than a year of lockdown, it has here acquired the adjective "Bad," as if to dare headline writers with an easy mark. A more accurate adjective might have been "Unnecessary" -- except perhaps for Lloyd Webber himself, whose unbroken 43-year streak of shows on Broadway, beginning with "Evita" in 1979, would otherwise end with the closing of "The Phantom of the Opera" in April.
Yet if there was no good reason for "Bad Cinderella," that doesn't mean it couldn't have been good. Quite a few recent and incoming musicals -- "& Juliet," "Once Upon a One More Time" and "Six" among them -- have more or less reasonably applied a feminist spin to pre-feminist tales and history.
"Bad Cinderella" seems as if it could have been in the same league. Emerald Fennell (original story and book) and Alexis Scheer (book adaptation) have rejiggered the traditional plot to give Cinderella (Linedy Genao) a better motive for marrying Prince Sebastian (Jordan Dobson) than mere infatuation; he's already her friend instead of a stranger she meets at a ball. Her transformation from a "gutter rose" and a "rebel" to a silver-leafed stunner, with the help of a godmother (Christina Acosta Robinson) who's more of a mad aesthetician than a fairy, is not for him, we are told, but herself.
Despite that, and a series of effortful numbers Genao sings bravely, her story, which is almost entirely internal, recedes. Sebastian's is more interesting. An unassuming, enlightened type, he has been dragooned into choosing a bride only because his brawnier and better-loved brother, Prince Charming, is presumed dead after disappearing at war. With both his mother (Grace McLean) and Cinderella's stepmother (Carolee Carmello) devising other plans for him -- the dreaded stepsisters, here hideous Valley Girls -- Sebastian's problem isn't figuring out whom to marry (he wants Cinderella) but how.
Those changes are hardly groundbreaking, especially coming from Fennell, who won an Oscar for writing the feminist revenge thriller "Promising Young Woman," and Scheer, whose play "Our Dear Dead Drug Lord" took a cudgel to stereotypes of innocent girlhood. Still, they ought to have been sufficient to make "Bad Cinderella" at least a winky hoot.
One reason it isn't is the unrelievedly pompous direction by Laurence Connor. Aside from those strident sets and costumes (by Gabriela Tylesova) and that aggressive sound (by Gareth Owen), there is a fundamental mismatch between the flippant fairy tale tone of the book, which wants the lightest possible treatment, and the exhaustingly one-note insistence of the staging. (The choreography is by JoAnn M. Hunter.) As in his work on the Broadway revivals of "Les Misèrables" in 2014 and "Miss Saigon" in 2017, Connor seems to favor busy, murky, late-Reagan-era oversell, not necessarily inappropriate to those late-Reagan-era shows but lacking the delicacy necessary for much that came after.
Also lacking delicacy: the songs, with workmanlike lyrics by David Zippel, and music by Lloyd Webber that often sounds like it escaped from "Phantom." The prettiest, if most bombastic, is "Only You, Lonely You" for Sebastian, which has the engine-in-overdrive feeling of "The Music of the Night," complete with triple-crème melody and sludgy orchestrations (also by Lloyd Webber).
But "Phantom" was a show about obsession, so its richness and hysteria made sense. If anything, "Bad Cinderella" is about plotting how to "marry for love" (the title of a song in the second act) and thus requires a much lighter touch. In only one number, "I Know You," which McLean and especially Carmello turn into the show's comic highlight, do Lloyd Webber and Zippel hit the mark.
Whether the mark is worth hitting is another matter; a comic duet that pits aging, carping viragos against each other in the manner of "Bosom Buddies" from "Mame" is not perhaps a feminist anthem. At least there are jokes to land: "I must admit I never quite forget a face/Though every feature's in a slightly different place." But mostly when aiming for drollery, the songwriters overshoot and wind up at operetta.
Well, "Phantom" was at bottom an operetta too, yet even in an obsolete genre has run on Broadway for 35 years. If "Bad Cinderella" does not seem likely to match that success, its virtues, however invisible to me, may yet be measurable by other means.
Keep in mind that Lloyd Webber's 12 previous Broadway musicals, starting with "Jesus Christ Superstar" in 1971, have run up a total of 30,000 performances, nearly 75 years' worth. (And he has just turned 75 himself.) What the shows have grossed in New York City -- $ 1.4 billion for "Phantom" alone -- could finance a moon mission, or pay off thousands of mortgages for employees and send their children to college.
Lloyd Webber, not only British but a Lord, has been, in that sense, America's most successful theater composer. We can argue that "Evita" wasn't good for the culture -- and "Cats" not good for anything -- but somehow, he and Broadway made a match that's lasted like no other. Even without the blessing of critics, and just like "Bad Cinderella," it's an implausible story about a real marriage of love.

An unassuming, enlightened type, he has been dragooned into choosing a bride only because his brawnier and better-loved brother, Prince Charming, is presumed dead after disappearing at war. With both his mother (Grace McLean) and Cinderella’s stepmother (Carolee Carmello) devising other plans for him — the dreaded stepsisters, here hideous Valley Girls — Sebastian’s problem isn’t figuring out whom to marry (he wants Cinderella) but how.
Those changes are hardly groundbreaking, especially coming from Fennell, who won an Oscar for writing the feminist revenge thriller “Promising Young Woman,” and Scheer, whose play “Our Dear Dead Drug Lord” took a cudgel to stereotypes of innocent girlhood. Still, they ought to have been sufficient to make “Bad Cinderella” at least a winky hoot.
One reason it isn’t is the unrelievedly pompous direction by Laurence Connor. Aside from those strident sets and costumes (by Gabriela Tylesova) and that aggressive sound (by Gareth Owen), there is a fundamental mismatch between the flippant fairy-tale tone of the book, which wants the lightest possible treatment, and the exhaustingly one-note insistence of the staging. (The choreography is by JoAnn M. Hunter.) As in his work on the Broadway revivals of “Les Misèrables” in 2014 and “Miss Saigon” in 2017, Connor seems to favor busy, murky, late-Reagan-era oversell, not necessarily inappropriate to those late-Reagan-era shows but lacking the delicacy necessary for much that came after.
Also lacking delicacy: the songs, with workmanlike lyrics by David Zippel, and music by Lloyd Webber that often sounds like it escaped from “Phantom.” The prettiest, if most bombastic, is “Only You, Lonely You” for Sebastian, which has the engine-in-overdrive feeling of “The Music of the Night,” complete with triple-creme melody and sludgy orchestrations (also by Lloyd Webber).
But “Phantom” was a show about obsession, so its richness and hysteria made sense. If anything, “Bad Cinderella” is about plotting how to “marry for love” (the title of a song in the second act) and so requires a much lighter touch. In only one number, “I Know You,” which McLean and Carmello turn into the show’s comic highlight, do Lloyd Webber and Zippel hit the mark.
Whether the mark is worth hitting is another matter; a comic duet that pits aging, carping viragos against each other in the manner of “Bosom Buddies” from “Mame” is not perhaps a feminist anthem. At least there are jokes to land: “I must admit I never quite forget a face / Though every feature’s in a slightly different place.” But mostly when aiming for drollery, the songwriters overshoot and wind up at operetta.
Well, “Phantom” was, at bottom, an operetta too, yet, even in an obsolete genre, it has run on Broadway for 35 years. If “Bad Cinderella” does not seem likely to match that success, its virtues, however invisible to me, may yet be measurable by other means.
Lloyd Webber’s 12 previous Broadway musicals, starting with “Jesus Christ Superstar” in 1971, have run up a total of 30,000 performances, nearly 75 years’ worth. What the shows have grossed in New York City — $1.4 billion for “Phantom” alone — could finance a moon mission, or pay off thousands of mortgages for employees and send their children to college.
Lloyd Webber, not only British but a lord, has been, in that sense, America’s most successful theater composer. We can argue that “Evita” wasn’t good for the culture — and “Cats” not good for anything — but somehow, he and Broadway made a match that’s lasted like no other. Even without the blessing of critics, and just like “Bad Cinderella,” it’s an implausible story about a real marriage of love.

Wuhan Market Report Found Genetic Traces of Virus and Animals: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In a much-anticipated study, experts described a swab that was positive for the coronavirus and contained loads of genetic material from raccoon dogs.
On Jan. 12, 2020, Chinese investigators combing a market for clues about the outbreak of a mysterious new illness in the city of Wuhan swabbed a cart. It was the kind typically used for transporting animal cages, and it came back positive for the coronavirus.
Three years later, a team of international experts has sifted through the genetic contents of that swab, which were quietly uploaded to an international database and made public only this year. In a report released on Monday night, the scientists described in detail for the first time evidence from the swab that they say strengthens the case that illegally traded wild animals ignited the coronavirus pandemic.
Chinese researchers who had originally uploaded the raw data had it removed from the database after they were contacted by the international team. Now administrators of the database itself have cut off access to the international scientists for what they said were rules violations, raising questions about the database's own role in the tug of war over access to data that could shed light on the origins of a virus that has killed seven million people.
Along with genetic signatures of the coronavirus, the swab from the cart contained more than 4,500 lengthy fragments of genetic material from raccoon dogs, the report said. It had none from humans. Some Covid-positive swabs taken from other objects and surfaces at the market, the report said, also had more genetic material from animals than from humans.
Finding genetic footprints from animals in the same place as genetic material from the virus does not prove that the animals themselves were infected. But some scientists who reviewed the report said that the dominance of genetic material from animals -- and especially raccoon dogs -- suggested that species known to be able to spread the coronavirus were indeed carrying infections at the market in late 2019.
That scenario, they said, was consistent with the virus spilling into humans from market animals and touching off the pandemic, a set of circumstances similar to the one that gave rise to the first SARS outbreak in China two decades earlier.
"You look at them and say those are probably infected animals," Theodora Hatziioannou, a virologist at The Rockefeller University in New York who was not involved in the research, said of the latest findings. "If it was a human shedding the virus, one would expect to find human DNA there, too."
The swabs could yet hold more clues about where the virus in the samples had come from. The report said, for instance, that there was evidence of particular genes that could suggest the material had come from a raccoon dog's upper respiratory tract.
Even if an animal had been infected, however, it would not be clear that it had spread the virus to people. Someone infected with the virus could have gotten a market animal sick. And only by swabbing animals directly could scientists prove whether they had been carrying the virus, a step that was precluded by the market being cleared of animals soon after the outbreak began.
The report has been the subject of intense speculation since the international experts presented their findings to the World Health Organization last week and then raced to compile their analyses. At the same time, the findings set off a battle for access to the genetic sequences at their heart.
Chinese scientists had initially uploaded the raw sequences to a global database some time after publishing a study describing them last year. But once the international experts discovered the data in early March and alerted Chinese researchers to what they had found, the data was taken offline.
Last week, the W.H.O. rebuked China for hiding such crucial information from the rest of the world for three years. Now the nonprofit organization based in Munich that runs the database, called GISAID, has come under scrutiny for its role in controlling access to the data.
In the new report, the international team of scientists said that GISAID had "deviated from its stated mission" in allowing the Chinese researchers to withhold the data for so long.
The database administrators responded to the report on Tuesday by cutting off the team members' access to their online accounts and saying that they had violated its rules by getting out ahead of the Chinese scientists and posting their own analysis. The scientists said that they hewed to GISAID's database-access agreement in downloading and studying the sequences, and noted that they had made multiple offers to work with the Chinese scientists.
"The ramifications of cutting off access to this group of authors are huge," said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona and co-author of the new report, noting that GISAID also jeopardized work by team members related to coronavirus variants and flu preparedness. "They're making false accusations."
The international team homed in on raccoon dogs -- fluffy mammals related to foxes and sold for meat and fur -- because of how much of the animals' genetic material was found in the key swab from the cart and because they are known to spread the virus. They said their findings were consistent with that animal harboring the virus, which originated in bats, and passing it to humans at the market.
"This isn't an infected animal," said Joel Wertheim, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, San Diego and a co-author of the report, referring to the new genetic data. "But this is the closest you can get without having the animal in front of you."
The report, though, also offered the most concrete evidence to date of other animals susceptible to the virus being sold at the market, noted Kristian Andersen, a virologist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif., and a co-author of the report. Genetic material from those animals -- like the masked palm civet, a small Asian mammal that was implicated in the SARS outbreak two decades ago -- was also found in swabs that were positive for the coronavirus.
"It's literally Disney Land for zoonotic transfer," said Joseph DeRisi, a professor of biochemistry at the University of California, San Francisco, and president of the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, referring to the range of animals documented in the report.
A number of other swabs at the market found large quantities of human genetic material -- an indication, the report said, of certain virus samples likely being shed by infected people. Many of the earliest known Covid patients worked or shopped at the market.
Still other positive swabs, the report said, were dominated by genetic material from animals that are not believed to be susceptible to the virus. A sample taken from a fish packaging surface, for example, contained a lot of fish genetic material. That virus was likely to have been deposited by a person, scientists said, illustrating that substantial amounts of animal genetic material did not necessarily mean that animals had produced the virus there.
Citing those findings, some scientists said that the kinds of swabs analyzed in the report simply could not offer conclusive proof of an infected animal.
"The report does contain useful information," Sergei Pond, a virologist at Temple University in Philadelphia, said. But, he added, "Does it tell you anything about which animal was infected? It really doesn't."
Dr. David Relman, a microbiologist at Stanford, said that it was difficult to assess the findings without more details about how the Chinese investigators had collected and analyzed their swabs. The Chinese paper last year, he noted, described using a kit to filter out human genetic material and make the tests more sensitive to the virus.
But a number of swabs from the Chinese researchers described in the international team's report contained substantial amounts of human genetic material, suggesting that those filtering methods had not depleted the samples of human material. Dr. DeRisi, who specializes in the type of analysis described in the report, said that such kits were generally ineffective at removing the genetic signatures of people.
Frederic Bushman, a microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania who also specializes in sequencing techniques, agreed that the report's methods were sound.
"I think the simplest explanation is that it's an infected raccoon dog," he said. "I don't think it's absolute proof."

Full text: Sabrina Brier is finding success online in the role of a 20-something in New York who's trying to shed her basic suburban past.
It was a dark Saturday night last month on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where Saturday nights can get very dark, but Sabrina Brier, in a rhinestone necklace and strapless plaid pantsuit, was agleam onstage at a basement comedy club called Caveat warming up the crowd.
"You're the butter, I'm the microwave," she announced.
That particular joke passed quickly, but the metaphor hung in the air. After some years sweating on the back burner of show business, Ms. Brier, 28, has found instant success on the social media platform of the moment, TikTok. She has over 400,000 followers, and many more fans who view, "like" and share her videos, which mostly parody life as a young woman of some privilege and erratic self-confidence vacillating between the excitement of the city and the reassuring comforts of suburbia. ("You see this nook? Perfect for a pumpkin," she declared in one about reclaiming fall, the supposed favorite season of "basic" white women. "Don't blame me, blame the architect!")
Ms. Brier specializes in point of view, or P.O.V., videos that confront relatable, often hateable characters, with a subtle sneer, gleefully rubbery body and arch delivery of generational catchphrases like "slay, queen" and "I got you," often repeated for effect. She recently spoofed the Get Ready With Me (GR.W.M.) genre that has women across America smearing makeup on their faces, plugging beauty products and oversharing in equal measure.
P.O.V. of that GR.W.M.: "the girl who bullied you in high school is trying to be an influencer."
In a five-part series on the "Extremely Passive Aggressive Roommate," Ms. Brier pretends not to care about taking out the trash when it isn't her day; enforces a rule about not having people over on weeknights; complains about her roomie coming home at 3:27 a.m.; strong-arms that roommate into renewing their lease and then welcomes a guest to "the common space." (The first three videos have each been seen millions of times.) Ms. Brier's own real-life roommate, Alice Duchen, an I.C.U. nurse, is often behind the camera, deadpan.
The two women live in Greenwich Village, near a rack of CitiBikes (Ms. Brier has also sent up the CitiBike poser who ostentatiously bleats "on your left!"), in a small two-bedroom walk-up apartment. She's on a lower floor than the character she plays in one of her most popular videos, who breathlessly urges a visitor to ascend six flights of stairs in a building she's trying to argue is luxury: "It's going to be so worth it! Come on!"
Eleven days before the Caveat comedy show, Ms. Brier sat in her apartment's dining area before a plate of untouched cookies, under a collection of paintings by her paternal grandmother, and told her origin story.
Her mother, Susan Cinoman, is a playwright currently working on a feminist retelling of the King Arthur legend who divorced Ms. Brier's father, a cardiologist, when she was 5. "Very cordial," Ms. Brier said. "Not any big drama."
She has an older sister, Gabrielle, now a producer, and they were obsessed with Disney Channel when little, staging a modern-day "Cinderella "-- "except instead of the ball it's like a Britney Spears concert" -- and later "rom-com girlie movies" like "Clueless" and "Mean Girls."
Ms. Brier was in the sixth grade when she first got a phone, the Verizon Chocolate. "We were the A.I.M. generation," she said, never dreaming that a phone could one day be a portal to everything. She attended Amity High School, where she won first place in a Shakespeare competition with a monologue from "The Taming of the Shrew," not sure comedy was her winning strategy. "It was such a thing where the boys were the ones who got to have the personality, right? The boys were the class clowns." She loosened up at Smith College, an all-women's liberal arts college, where she majored in theater and took improv classes.
"It was always easy to identify her as someone who was performative," Ms. Cinoman said on the phone. "She wasn't an extrovert per se, but half of Sabrina was looking out the window at all times. Some other set of realities were impinging on the one that we were all in with her."
After graduation, Ms. Brier worked in talent management for two years, and then got an assistant job in the writers' room of "For Life," an ABC drama about a wrongfully convicted man who becomes a prison lawyer to exonerate himself. "I am a fiend for anything that makes me cry," Ms. Brier said. "Inside every comedienne is a sad girl, and that's definitely me."
After one season, Covid arrived. Restless in quarantine, she began posting videos on Instagram, one of which got picked up by Barstool, the popular sports blog. But this was before Reels. "It would be kind of blurry, and it wasn't translating, and I didn't understand it, and felt old," she said. Then she tossed up a few on TikTok, notably one in which she faux-naively referred to Houston Street in New York, which is pronounced How-ston, as Hew-ston. Boom.
As Ms. Brier expanded her oeuvre from the single note of a Connecticut transplant in New York into the complicated jazz of friendship, especially female friendship, she began getting recognized in restaurants and on sidewalks. Dixie D'Amelio, a princess of the platform, named her account a favorite to follow. The model Emily Ratajkowski used Ms. Brier's voice-over for a video about being "perceived." The playwright Jeremy O. Harris included her in his "Coronavirus Mixtape" posts, carousels of videos and memes Mr. Harris posted during lockdown.
Ms. Brier's viral fame has caught the attention of brands that pay her to write comic bits featuring their products, how she now makes her living. The girl who once made a video about being "the ULTIMATE subway girl" who couldn't swipe her MetroCard is now being hired to sell Subway sandwiches. (Other sponsorships include Bumble, Uno the board game and mirrored cellphone cases.)
But she dreams of having, and show-running, her own television program. In May, she'll perform two nights as her character at Union Hall in Park Slope, Brooklyn -- a neighborhood that character would probably struggle to find. Now represented by Creative Artists Agency, Ms. Brier is auditioning to play other parts as well.
In this town, after all, you still need ambition as well as an algorithm.
"People are like, 'Wow, this is all happening,"' Ms. Brier said. "And I'm like, 'This is just things working out the way I was trying to get them to work out. It's not random."'

Full text: In a long career in the House and armed with a barbed wit, she helped win legislation on family leave, pregnancy discrimination and other progressive causes.
Patricia Schroeder, a former leading feminist legislator who helped redefine the role of women in American politics and used her wit to combat sexism in Congress, died on Monday in Celebration, Fla. She was 82.
Her death, in a hospital, was attributed to complications of a stroke, her daughter, Jamie Cornish, said.
Ms. Schroeder, who was a pilot and a Harvard-trained lawyer, had a long and distinguished career in the House of Representatives. She was a driving force behind the passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which guarantees women and men up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a family member.
She helped pass the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act, which barred employers from dismissing women because they were pregnant and from denying them maternity benefits. And she championed laws that helped reform spousal pensions, opened military jobs to women, and forced federally funded medical researchers to include women in their studies.
Elected in 1972 as an opponent of the Vietnam War, Ms. Schroeder served on the Armed Services Committee for all 24 years she was in Congress. From that perch, she called for arms control and reduced military spending.
She worked to improve benefits for military personnel and persuaded the committee to recommend that women be allowed to fly combat missions; Defense Secretary Les Aspin ordered it so in 1993, and by 1995 the first female fighter pilot was flying in combat. That only further outraged Ms. Schroeder's critics on the right, like Lt. Col. Oliver North, who called her one of the nation's 25 most dangerous politicians.
One of the most enduring public images of Ms. Schroeder is of her crying when she announced in 1987 that she would not run for president, as her supporters had hoped. At an outdoor event in Denver, she choked up with emotion, pressed a tissue to her eyes and at one point leaned her head on her husband's shoulder. The episode dismayed some feminists, who said her tears had reinforced stereotypes and set back the cause of women seeking office.
It was an ironic charge against a woman who had done so much to promote that cause. Ms. Schroeder was the first woman elected to Congress from Colorado and the first to serve on the Armed Services Committee. She had to fight blatant discrimination from the start, facing questions about how, as the mother of two young children, she could function as both a mother and a lawmaker.
"I have a brain and a uterus and I use both," she responded.
When she arrived on Capitol Hill, she was one of just 14 women in the House, an institution she called a "guy gulag," where she was sometimes dismissed as "Little Patsy" even though she was relatively tall.
Ms. Schroeder was fully aware that women seemed to make many congressmen antsy. "It's really funny if two women stand on the House floor," she said. "There are usually at least two men who go by and say, 'What is this, a coup?' They're almost afraid to see us in public together."
In her book "24 Years of House Work ... and the Place Is Still a Mess" (1998), she wrote of being engaged in battles on every front, "whether we were fighting for female pages (there were none) or a place where we could pee."
The antagonism toward women was particularly pointed from Representative F. Edward Hebert, a conservative Louisiana Democrat who was the powerful chairman of what had been the all-male Armed Services Committee. At their first committee meeting in 1973, he made Ms. Schroeder sit in the same chair with Representative Ron Dellums, an African American. As she recounted it in her book, she and Mr. Dellums had to sit "cheek to cheek" because the chairman "said that women and blacks were worth only half of one 'regular' member."
It is not clear that he actually uttered those words -- other accounts, including Mr. Dellums's, do not contain that quotation -- but Ms. Schroeder was a sharp rhetorical speaker with a tart tongue, and she was not afraid to use it.
She was the one who branded Ronald Reagan the "Teflon president," against whom bad news, like the Iran-contra scandal, did not stick. Of Vice President Dan Quayle, she said, "He thinks that Roe versus Wade are two ways to cross the Potomac."
Her analysis of her opponents' strength carried the sting of truth: "The genius of the Republicans has been how they figured out how to so polarize the middle class that we vote against our own best interests." During her brief flirtation with running for president, she said the question she was trying to answer was this: "Is America man enough to back a woman?"
Ms. Schroeder had been co-chair of Gary Hart's promising 1987 presidential campaign, until he quit after being exposed as an adulterer. His sudden absence prompted Ms. Schroeder to consider running herself.
Had she pursued the White House, she would have been the first woman from a major party to do so since Representative Shirley Chisholm of Brooklyn, who sought the Democratic nomination in 1972.
But when she announced in Denver that she had decided against it, the crowd groaned. Her supporters had expected her to run. At that moment, her tears spilled forth.
"I had underestimated how much I wanted to pursue the presidency," she wrote in her book, in a chapter titled "The Presidential Weep-Stakes."
"I went on with my speech, but it was my tears, not my words, that got the headlines," she added. "Those 17 seconds were treated like a total breakdown."
Indeed, they created a media frenzy. Female columnists said she had ruined the chance for any woman to run for president for the rest of the century, while her conservative critics said she had displayed a dangerous emotionalism.
The harsh reaction, she said, only underscored the double standard for men versus women in American politics.
"I think it's amazing," she said, "that no one ever said that Joe Biden had ruined the future of men forever because people would think that they all plagiarized or that Gary Hart ruined the future of men forever because they all played around."
After her death, President Biden released a statement of condolence, saying in part: "On issue after issue, Pat stood up for basic fairness, sensible policy, and women's equal humanity. The result was a legislative record that changed millions of women's lives -- and men's lives -- for the better."
Patricia Nell Scott was born on July 30, 1940, in Portland, Ore. Her father, Lee Combs Scott, was a pilot who owned an aviation insurance company. Her mother, Bernice, taught first grade. The family moved often, ending up in Des Moines, where Ms. Schroeder graduated from high school.
She earned her pilot's license at 15 and attended the University of Minnesota, where she was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and majored in philosophy, history and political science.
From there she went to Harvard Law School, where she was one of 15 women in a class of more than 500. She married a classmate, James Schroeder, in 1962. In addition to her daughter, she is survived by her husband, along with their son, Scott; Ms. Schroeder's brother, Mike Scott; and four grandchildren.
After Ms. Schroeder graduated from Harvard Law in 1964, she and her family settled in Denver, where she worked for the National Labor Relations Board, volunteered as counsel for Planned Parenthood and taught at the University of Colorado and Regis College.
In 1972, when President Richard M. Nixon appeared to be headed for re-election in a landslide, the Democratic Party fielded only a conservative candidate for Congress in Ms. Schroeder's Denver district. Other liberals, including her husband, encouraged her to challenge him in a primary. They did not think she could necessarily win, but they thought it was important that someone give voice to their views -- antiwar, pro-environment and pro-women's rights.
She had almost no money and no backing, but her message and enthusiasm caught on. Gloria Steinem campaigned for her. And she won both the primary and the general election against a Republican incumbent, despite the Nixon landslide. Years later, when she requested her F.B.I. file, Ms. Schroeder found out that the bureau had placed her under surveillance during that race, breaking into her home and even recruiting her husband's barber as an informant.
She was re-elected 11 more times with only token Republican opposition. After the Democrats lost the House in 1994 and she had served in the minority for two years, she decided to retire. She would be 56 and the longest-serving woman in the House, and her decision upset many Democrats.
"She was the coach, the leader, the strategist," Representative Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat from New York, told The Washington Post. "She was, by far, the greatest feminist of my time."
Even some foes bore her grudging respect. Tony Blankley, press secretary to her nemesis, the Republican speaker Newt Gingrich, said, "I sense her legacy will be effectiveness in political rhetoric," which he called "an honorable part of this business."
As she left the House, she remained discouraged by the lack of gender equality in Congress. She told The Los Angeles Times, "I think women still should never kid themselves that they're going to come here and be part of the team."
She taught briefly at Princeton before becoming president and chief operating officer of the Association of American Publishers, the trade association for the book publishing industry, where she served for 11 years.
There, she fiercely opposed Google's plan to digitize copyrighted books, declaring that Google was "seeking to make millions of dollars by freeloading on the talent and property of authors and publishers." The dispute eventually ended in a settlement in 2008 in which writers and publishers would be compensated and, in some cases, users would be allowed to see up to 20 percent of the content of a book.
Afterward, she and her husband retired to Florida, specifically Celebration, a master-planned community built (and sold) by the Walt Disney Company. She remained an activist, continuing to advocate for the causes that had always animated her, like improving family life and caring for the planet, just as she had imagined doing in her book decades earlier.
"In my dotage, rocking on my porch," she wrote, "I will probably be faxing or emailing or communicating by whatever 21st-century method I cannot even fathom about social wrongs that need to be righted."

Full text: Michelle Yeoh made history, Ke Huy Quan made us tear up and Cocaine Bear made us cringe. These were just some of the highs and lows.
What will go wrong? After several years of missteps and controversies, that was the question hanging over the Oscar telecast on Sunday night. But the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences pulled off a largely controversy-free ceremony that seemed to keep everything on track, or at least didn't go off the rails. It came in close to on time, featured several emotional moments and even set some records. Here are the highs and lows as we saw them.
Most Historic Victory: Michelle Yeoh Becomes the First Asian Best Actress Winner
In the 95-year history of the Oscars, an Asian performer had never taken home the best actress statuette -- until Sunday, when Michelle Yeoh won the Academy Award for her lead performance as a beleaguered laundromat owner in "Everything Everywhere All at Once."
Her win -- also the first for a Malaysian performer -- was one of many breakthroughs for Asian artists on Sunday. Her co-star Ke Huy Quan became the first Vietnamese-born performer to win an Oscar, and their combined victories marked the first time more than one performer of Asian descent had won an Oscar in a single year.
"For all the little boys and girls who look like me watching tonight, this is a beacon of hope and possibilities," Yeoh said, adding, "This is proof that dreams -- dream big, and dreams do come true." -- Matt Stevens
Quickest Pivot: Jimmy Kimmel Jokes About the Slap
Long before the telecast, academy executives made it clear: they did not want the Slap -- the shocking moment when Will Smith struck Chris Rock onstage last year -- to be mentioned on the telecast this year, not even in joke form. They took great pains to make sure something like that would not happen again, going so far as to set up a crisis team and run through different scenarios. They even chose a veteran host, Jimmy Kimmel, for his ability to handle anything live television could throw at him. What they didn't count on was the host bringing up the subject they most wanted to avoid.
"If anyone in this theater commits an act of violence at any point during the show, you will be awarded the Oscar for best actor and permitted to give a 19-minute-long speech," he joked near the top of the show, starting a string of jokes related to the Slap. Since it was the subject many of us at home were most interested in, the academy's loss was our gain. -- Stephanie Goodman
Most Heartfelt Acceptance: Ke Huy Quan
The Oscars can often vacillate between insidery navel-gazing and a ho-hum march toward best picture, but occasionally an acceptance speech cuts through the noise with authenticity. On Sunday, those emotional words came from a teary-eyed Ke Huy Quan, 51, whose supporting actor Oscar was the stuff of dreams.
After childhood success in "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" and "The Goonies," his career had stalled for two long decades until he won the role of a supportive but neglected husband in "Everything Everywhere All at Once," the part that brought him to the Dolby Theater.
Putting in perspective the long road some performers tread to achieve film's highest honor, the Vietnamese-born Quan thanked his 84-year-old mother, who was at home watching, for the sacrifices she made to bring their family to the United States. "My journey started on a boat," he said. "I spent a year in a refugee camp. And somehow, I ended up here on Hollywood's biggest stage. They say stories like this only happen in the movies. I cannot believe it's happening to me. This, this is the American dream." -- Maya Salam
Biggest Feel-Good Win: Jamie Lee Curtis
It was fitting, probably, that Jamie Lee Curtis won the supporting actress Oscar just a few minutes after her "Everything Everywhere All at Once" co-star Ke Huy Quan took supporting actor.
Quan's win bookended a pretty epic career comeback; Curtis is Hollywood royalty, a daughter of two actors who got her start in "Halloween" in the 1970s. Neither of the pair's similarly long but very different journeys had included winning an Academy Award -- until Sunday. Their back-to-back wins got the ceremony off to a rousing start, filling it with warmth, nostalgia and good feelings.
Curtis, 64, made sure to spread all that love, saying that she shared her honor with the many people who had helped her along the way. And that included, she made sure to note, all the fans of the "Halloween" franchise, "True Lies" and the many, many other movies she has made over the decades.
"To all of the people who have supported the genre movies that I have made for all these years, the thousands and hundreds of thousands of people," she said, adding pauses for emphasis, "we just won an Oscar together!" -- Matt Stevens
Most Metaphoric Speech: Brendan Fraser
An incomplete accounting of all the nautical references in Brendan Fraser's acceptance speech after he won best actor for "The Whale": "throwing me a creative lifeline," "hauling me aboard," "the good ship 'The Whale,"' "our lighthouse," "whale-sized hearts," "only whales can swim at the depth of the talent of Hong Chau" and "like a bit of a diving expedition on the bottom of the ocean."
Metaphors aside, Fraser's acceptance was certainly heartfelt. The first-time nominee had been considered a front-runner for the Oscar since the film premiered at the Venice Film Festival at the end of the summer, and his win was the grace note on a lovely comeback story. But in the emotion of the moment, it all came out a bit waterlogged. -- Nancy Coleman
Best Speech by a Director Not Up for Best Director: Sarah Polley
Sarah Polley, the writer and director of "Women Talking," wasn't nominated in the best directing category, despite the film being nominated for best picture. After rare wins for women in the last two years -- Chloé Zhao for "Nomadland" and Jane Campion for "The Power of the Dog" -- no female directors were recognized at this year's ceremony. At least not officially: Polley ended up still having her moment onstage when she won best adapted screenplay. Wearing a spiffy black tux and glasses, she referred to both the title of her acclaimed film and the steep hill she had just climbed by thanking the academy for "not being too mortally offended by the words 'women' and 'talking' put so close together like that." -- Reggie Ugwu
Best Pop Superstar Performance, Tie: Rihanna and Lady Gaga
The queens didn't disappoint.
Two divas with soaring voices and impeccable stage presence took two very different approaches to performing on Sunday night, both to great success. Lady Gaga chose to strip it all down, removing the gothic makeup she wore on the red carpet and opting for black jeans and a black T-shirt. The unexpected approach worked, giving her track "Hold My Hand" from the blockbuster "Top Gun: Maverick" more gravitas than originally perceived.
Equally successful was Rihanna's homage to Chadwick Boseman in "Lift Me Up," with her band and backup singers ensconced in designs that resembled thatched roofs and the singer on a movable riser. The soaring ballad benefited from the deft stage design and Rihanna's vocals brought down the house. -- Nicole Sperling
Smartest Fashion Choice: Recycled Couture
There were lots of trends on the Oscar champagne carpet -- white dresses, black dresses, princess dresses, orange dresses (orange dresses? believe it), increasingly important jewels -- but the best one by far was the trend of actors shopping, if not their closets, then the closets of the brands that dressed them. Winnie Harlow wore a bright yellow Armani dress from 2005; Vanessa Hudgens wore black-and-white vintage Chanel; and Cate Blanchett wore a strong-shouldered sapphire velvet Louis Vuitton from the archive.
If the awards-show circuit has become in part a piece of fashion marketing content, this was as good an ad as any for the idea that new is not always better, and that the attention paid to what everyone wears can actually be used for a higher purpose than just promoting new stuff. Unlike the decision to swap the red carpet for a champagne-colored version, which was supposed to make the arrival segment feel contemporary but instead mostly made a lot of the dresses disappear, the reworn looks came closest to making the carpet seem relevant. -- Vanessa Friedman
Worst Production Design: The Not-Red Carpet
Was this the Oscars or an Ashley HomeStore showroom? Sure, the beige -- sorry, champagne -- carpet may have worked out well for Cara Delevingne, whose dramatic red Elie Saab gown popped against the decidedly unremarkable rug before it picked up some mud stains and began prompting dirty martini comparisons. And it made a chameleon of Jamie Lee Curtis, clad in a beige beaded gown. But 99 percent of the time, we just wanted Michelle Yeoh to verse-jump us to the alternate Oscars with the classic red rug. -- Sarah Bahr
Worst Tie-in: 'The Little Mermaid' Trailer
The actors Melissa McCarthy and Halle Bailey were introduced the same way presenters were. So you might have thought they were there to hand out an award. Yes, the two are stars of the live-action "Little Mermaid," with Bailey in the lead role, and the ceremony has often had actors in coming projects announce winners. But it hasn't generally been in the habit of introducing trailer premieres. With the exception of Sunday night.
The Oscars are broadcast on the Disney-owned network ABC and plenty of people are certainly excited to see the trailer for that studio's upcoming "Little Mermaid." But weaving that trailer into the actual ceremony (rather than running it as part of an ad bloc) just feels like a shameless use of the Oscar telecast's running time, especially when winners (including Judy Chin, an honoree for best makeup for "The Whale,") were played off during their acceptance speeches. -- Mekado Murphy
Weirdest Scheduling Decision: Big Wins, Then a Dull Song
Typically the Oscars like to space out the supporting-actor and supporting-actress wins, which are often the night's most emotional and talked about. So why did this broadcast have Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis shoved so close together, and then a wan original-song performance right after? (That would be Sofia Carson with "Applause," from the little known anthology film "Tell It Like a Woman.") Either of those acceptance speeches could have powered us through an entire commercial break. Let these jubilant winners have their moment, and give the audience the room to take it all in! -- Kyle Buchanan
Best Scheduling Decision: The Return of the Shorts Categories
The decision to hand out the short film Oscars before the telecast last year was controversial. Some observers (cough, me, cough) thought it was a good idea; academy members were largely opposed. I'm here to admit I was wrong. After a new executive team promised to restore them to the telecast this year, the shorts provided some wonderful moments on Sunday.
Who can resist a speech that begins, "I know the protocol is to say thank you a lot, but I'm British, so I'm more comfortable saying sorry"? That's what one of the animated short filmmakers, Matthew Freud ("The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse"), said as he apologized to all those who helped but couldn't be onstage with him. And without the winning live-action short "An Irish Goodbye," starring James Martin as a man with Down syndrome, would we have had the entire Dolby Theater serenading him with a round of "Happy Birthday"? I'm not crying; you're crying. -- Stephanie Goodman
Most Unexpected Comic: Malala
As Jimmy Kimmel filled the space between awards by asking audience members questions supposedly from fans, Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani activist for girls' education and the youngest recipient of a Nobel Peace Prize, was suddenly confronted by one of last year's pop culture fixations: "Do you think Harry Styles spit on Chris Pine?" Yousafzai -- who was an executive producer of "Stranger at the Gate," a nominee for best short documentary -- did not miss a beat. "I only talk about peace," she replied. The response swiftly ended the banter, but it wasn't long before she was wrapped up in a second middling joke, when a costumed Cocaine Bear crawled over to her. Malala, on behalf of all Americans, I apologize for these bits. -- Julia Jacobs
Best Dressed, Animal Division: Jenny the Donkey
A shining red bow and bedazzled emotional-support animal vest has never looked better. A donkey who looked a lot like Jenny, the undisputed star of best picture nominee "The Banshees of Inisherin," joined Kimmel onstage halfway through the broadcast, looking fairly confused about her surroundings but otherwise content.
"Not only is Jenny an actor," Kimmel said, "she's a certified emotional support donkey -- or at least that's what we told the airline to get her on the plane from Ireland." (Full disclosure: As The Los Angeles Times reported, that was not the real Jenny.) If the Tonys can tote a goat through the audience, it's about time the Oscars hopped on the furry bandwagon ... or, at the very least, time they honored the true darling of the season. -- Nancy Coleman
Worst Dressed, Animal Division: The Person in the Cocaine Bear Suit
Not all furry bandwagons need to be hopped on. Also, please leave Malala alone. -- Nancy Coleman
Best Musical Number With Dancing: 'Naatu Naatu'
"Do you know Naatu?" the Indian actress Deepika Padukone asked about an hour and a half into Sunday night's ceremony. Music to our ears. The showstopping number from the Indian action spectacular was recreated on the Dolby Theater stage, complete with suspenders popping, manic high-stepping and frenetic nodding. Chandrabose and M.M. Keeravani's syncopated tune would go on to win the Oscar for best original song. If something had to follow Jenny the donkey's cameo, this would be it. -- Sarah Bahr
Worst Musical Number With Dancing: 'This Is a Life'
A lot could be said about the David Byrne and company's performance of the best original song nominee "This Is a Life," from "Everything Everywhere All at Once." But an exchange between two of our writers sums it up best:
Wesley Morris: Byrne's hot dog fingers are as long and round as the singing is flat.
Kyle Buchanan: At least this number has returned inscrutable modern dance to the Oscars, where it belongs!
Most Welcome Repeat Winner: Costume Designer Ruth Carter
It was so refreshing to see Ruth Carter, the costume designer behind "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever," win her second Oscar. She's the first Black woman to win two Academy Awards -- she also won for the original "Black Panther" -- so she's been on this stage before. "Nice to see you again," she told the crowd on Sunday, and thanked the academy for recognizing the supernatural skills that every Black woman has, not just in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
She also paid tribute to her late mother who died in early March, at 101. She said "Wakanda Forever," which begins with a funeral procession after the death of King T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), had prepared her for her mother's passing, and in her speech asked Boseman to watch over the matriarch. Though Carter, who got her start designing outfits for Spike Lee in the '80s, was the only winner among the film's five nominations, she said she was grateful to reshape culture through film.
Something tells me this won't be her last time on the Oscar stage. -- Kalia Richardson
Most Welcome First-Timer: James Hong
There was one "Everything Everywhere" win that didn't come with a trophy: Jimmy Kimmel's tribute to one of the film's stars, the 94-year-old actor James Hong.
Kimmel noted that while the Chinese American actor has starred in more than 650 films and television shows, he didn't start acting professionally until age 25. He actually worked as a civil engineer who, Kimmel explained, helped design the road system in Los Angeles. "James, allow me to say, you are one of our great living actors and one of our worst civil engineers. The roads are unconscionable. But we salute you, James," Kimmel said.
Hong has gained more attention over the past year than seemingly in his entire, 69-year career, and we are here for it.
A founding member of the East-West Players theater troupe, he's certainly among the most prolific Asian American actors ever, with credits that include "Big Trouble in Little China" and "Kung Fu Panda." When "Everything Everywhere" won the Screen Actors Guild Award for best ensemble last month, Hong took center stage and spoke candidly about Hollywood's racism toward Asians during the 1950s. "But look at us now!" he said, arms upraised.
On Sunday, Hong could be seen onstage holding an Oscar, at the end of the night, when "Everything Everywhere" was named best picture. In many ways, it's a capstone to his remarkable life and career. But let's hope the James Hong renaissance is just getting started. -- Barbara Chai

Academy Awards Draws 18.7 Million Viewers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The viewership rose a second consecutive year, but was still the third-least-watched Oscars on record.
ABC executives and much of Hollywood can breathe a sigh of relief.
Viewership totals for ABC's telecast of the 95th Academy Awards on Sunday night rose for a second consecutive year, drawing 18.7 million people, according to Nielsen.
Even so, it was the third-least-watched Oscars on record. The standards for success in awards show ratings have been scrambled in recent years, however, as viewers increasingly turn away from much of live television in favor of on-demand streaming entertainment.
Only 10.4 million people watched the pared-down pandemic edition of the Oscars in 2021, setting off alarm bells within ABC and the entire entertainment industry. Last year's Oscars attracted 16.6 million, with viewership swelling after Will Smith slapped Chris Rock onstage. Before 2018, the telecast had never dropped below 32 million.
Sunday's Oscars had a few things going for it. Superstars like Rihanna and Lady Gaga performed nominated songs. Two films up for best picture grossed more than $ 1 billion at the box office -- "Top Gun: Maverick" collected $ 1.5 billion, and "Avatar: The Way of Water" took in $ 2.3 billion. And the best picture winner, "Everything Everywhere All at Once," generated $ 104 million in ticket sales. Viewership tends to increase when popular films are nominated.
In the run-up to Sunday's ceremony, the academy tapped new marketing partners like Letterboxd, a social media site for movie fans (with 8.4 million members, most of them ages 18 to 34), and increased its promotional efforts on TikTok, Instagram and Twitter.
Viewership among adults under 50 grew by 5 percent when compared with last year's Oscars, according to Nielsen.
The ceremony was hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, and might have been notable for the simplest thing: avoiding controversy. Reviews were mixed, with some critics praising the show's traditional look and feel, and others being turned off by what Mike Hale described in The New York Times as a "promotional, exhortatory, shrink-wrapped" ceremony.
The evening had plenty of tears, with all four acting winners (Brendan Fraser, Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis) giving emotionally charged speeches. In a change, most of the winners avoided soliloquies about politics, aspects of speeches that academy research has shown make people grab the remote.
Several pieces of data now point to a live events ratings turnaround this year. The Grammy Awards rebounded to 12.5 million viewers this year, up from 9.6 million last year. And last month the Super Bowl drew 113 million viewers, the second-highest viewership total in the game's history.
As recently as two years ago, the Oscars seemed vulnerable to losing its long-ranking status as the most-watched entertainment program in American television. Its position had became so weak that HBO programmed the finale of its hugely popular freshman drama, "The Last of Us," opposite the Oscars on Sunday night. (When "The Last of Us" went head-to-head against the Super Bowl last month, network executives released that week's episode on a Friday on HBO Max; the network did not bother deploying that get-out-in-front-of-it strategy for the Oscars.) HBO said on Monday that the finale drew a season high of 8.2 million viewers.
ABC has the broadcast rights to the Oscars through 2028, and the network provides the academy with roughly 80 percent of its annual revenue. The academy reported that the 2022 Oscars generated $ 137.1 million, almost all of it coming from Disney, ABC's parent company, for the domestic and international licensing rights.
ABC said on Friday that it had sold out its Oscars inventory; Pfizer, Rolex and Verizon were the lead sponsors. The network did not divulge its prices, but advertising buyers said ABC had charged between $ 1.6 million and $ 2.1 million for a 30-second spot, down slightly from the previous year.
And as ratings have slumped, ABC has increased the number of ads it places in the Oscars telecast. Last year, it collected about $ 139 million across 70 commercials, according to Vivvix, which tracks ad spending. In 2021, ABC pulled in $ 129 million across 56 ads. The red carpet preshow brings in roughly $ 16 million annually.

What will go wrong?
After several years of missteps and controversies, that was the question hanging over the Oscar telecast Sunday night. But the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences pulled off a largely controversy-free ceremony that seemed to keep everything on track, or at least didn’t go off the rails. It came in close to on time, featured several emotional moments and even set some records.
Here are the highs and lows as we saw them.
Most Historic Victory: Michelle Yeoh Becomes the First Asian Best Actress Winner
In the 95-year history of the Oscars, an Asian performer had never taken home the best actress statuette — until Sunday, when Michelle Yeoh won the Academy Award for her lead performance as a beleaguered laundromat owner in “Everything Everywhere All at Once.”
Her win — also the first for a Malaysian performer — was one of many breakthroughs for Asian artists Sunday. Her co-star Ke Huy Quan became the first Vietnamese-born performer to win an Oscar, and their combined victories marked the first time more than one performer of Asian descent had won an Oscar in a single year.
“For all the little boys and girls who look like me watching tonight, this is a beacon of hope and possibilities,” Yeoh said, adding, “This is proof that dreams — dream big, and dreams do come true.” — Matt Stevens
Quickest Pivot: Jimmy Kimmel Jokes About the Slap
Long before the telecast, academy executives made it clear: They did not want the Slap — the shocking moment when Will Smith struck Chris Rock onstage last year — to be mentioned on the telecast this year, not even in joke form. They took great pains to make sure something like that would not happen again, going so far as to set up a crisis team and run through different scenarios. They even chose a veteran host, Jimmy Kimmel, for his ability to handle anything that live television could throw at him. What they didn’t count on was the host bringing up the subject they most wanted to avoid.
“If anyone in this theater commits an act of violence at any point during the show, you will be awarded the Oscar for best actor and permitted to give a 19-minute-long speech,” he joked near the top of the show, starting a string of jokes related to The Slap.
Since it was the subject many of us at home were most interested in, the academy’s loss was our gain. — Stephanie Goodman
Most Heartfelt Acceptance: Ke Huy Quan
The Oscars can often vacillate between insidery navel-gazing and a ho-hum march toward best picture, but occasionally an acceptance speech cuts through the noise with authenticity. On Sunday, those emotional words came from a teary-eyed Ke Huy Quan, 51, whose supporting actor Oscar was the stuff of dreams.
After childhood success in “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom” and “The Goonies,” his career had stalled for two long decades until he won the role of a supportive but neglected husband in “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” the part that brought him to the Dolby Theater.
Putting in perspective the long road some performers tread to achieve film’s highest honor, the Vietnamese-born Quan thanked his 84-year-old mother, who was at home watching, for the sacrifices she made to bring their family to the United States.
“My journey started on a boat,” he said. “I spent a year in a refugee camp. And somehow, I ended up here on Hollywood’s biggest stage. They say stories like this only happen in the movies. I cannot believe it’s happening to me. This, this is the American dream.” — Maya Salam
Biggest Feel-Good Win: Jamie Lee Curtis
It was fitting, probably, that Jamie Lee Curtis won the supporting actress Oscar just a few minutes after her “Everything Everywhere All at Once” co-star Ke Huy Quan took supporting actor.
Quan’s win bookended a pretty epic career comeback; Curtis is Hollywood royalty, a daughter of two actors who got her start in “Halloween” in the 1970s. Neither of the pair’s similarly long but very different journeys had included winning an Academy Award — until Sunday. Their back-to-back wins got the ceremony off to a rousing start, filling it with warmth, nostalgia and good feelings.
Curtis, 64, made sure to spread all that love, saying that she shared her honor with the many people who had helped her along the way. And that included, she made sure to note, all the fans of the “Halloween” franchise, “True Lies” and the many other movies she has been made over the decades.
“To all of the people who have supported the genre movies that I have made for all these years, the thousands and hundreds of thousands of people,” she said, adding pauses for emphasis, “we just won an Oscar together!” — Matt Stevens
Most Metaphoric Speech: Brendan Fraser
An incomplete accounting of all the nautical references in Brendan Fraser’s acceptance speech after he won best actor for “The Whale”: “throwing me a creative lifeline,” “hauling me aboard,” “the good ship ‘The Whale,’” “our lighthouse,” “whale-sized hearts,” “only whales can swim at the depth of the talent of Hong Chau” and “like a bit of a diving expedition on the bottom of the ocean.”
Metaphors aside, Fraser’s acceptance was certainly heartfelt. The first-time nominee had been considered a front-runner for the Oscar since the film premiered at the Venice Film Festival at the end of the summer, and his win was the grace note on a lovely comeback story. But in the emotion of the moment, it all came out a bit waterlogged. — Nancy Coleman
Best Speech by a Director Not Up for Best Director: Sarah Polley
Sarah Polley, the writer and director of “Women Talking,” wasn’t nominated in the best directing category, despite the film being nominated for best picture. After rare wins for women in the past two years — Chloé Zhao for “Nomadland” and Jane Campion for “The Power of the Dog” — no female directors were recognized at this year’s ceremony. At least not officially: Polley ended up still having her moment onstage when she won best adapted screenplay.
Wearing a spiffy black tux and glasses, she referred to both the title of her acclaimed film and the steep hill she had just climbed by thanking the academy for “not being too mortally offended by the words ‘women’ and ‘talking’ put so close together like that.” — Reggie Ugwu
Best Pop Superstar Performance, Tie: Rihanna and Lady Gaga
The queens didn’t disappoint.
Two divas with soaring voices and impeccable stage presence took two very different approaches to performing Sunday night, both to great success. Lady Gaga chose to strip it all down, removing the gothic makeup she wore on the red carpet and opting for black jeans and a black T-shirt. The unexpected approach worked, giving her track “Hold My Hand” from the blockbuster “Top Gun: Maverick” more gravitas than originally perceived.
Equally successful was Rihanna’s homage to Chadwick Boseman in “Lift Me Up,” with her band and backup singers ensconced in designs that resembled thatched roofs and the singer on a movable riser. The soaring ballad benefited from the deft stage design and Rihanna’s vocals brought down the house. — Nicole Sperling

Winnie Harlow wore a bright yellow Armani dress from 2005; Vanessa Hudgens wore black-and-white vintage Chanel; and Cate Blanchett wore a strong-shouldered sapphire velvet Louis Vuitton from the archive.
If the awards-show circuit has become in part a piece of fashion marketing content, this was as good an ad as any for the idea that new is not always better, and that the attention paid to what everyone wears can actually be used for a higher purpose than just promoting new stuff.

Worst Production Design: The Not-Red Carpet
Was this the Oscars or an Ashley HomeStore showroom? Sure, the beige — sorry, champagne — carpet may have worked out well for Cara Delevingne, whose dramatic red Elie Saab gown popped against the decidedly unremarkable rug before it picked up some mud stains and began prompting dirty martini comparisons. And it made a chameleon of Jamie Lee Curtis, clad in a beige beaded gown.
But 99% of the time, we just wanted Michelle Yeoh to verse-jump us to the alternate Oscars with the classic red rug. — Sarah Bahr
Worst Tie-in: ‘The Little Mermaid’ Trailer

The showstopping number from the Indian action spectacular was re-created on the Dolby Theater stage, complete with suspenders popping, manic high-stepping and frenetic nodding. Chandrabose and M.M. Keeravani’s syncopated tune would go on to win the Oscar for best original song.

Worst Musical Number With Dancing: ‘This Is a Life’
A lot could be said about the David Byrne and company’s performance of the best original song nominee “This Is a Life,” from “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” But an exchange between two of our writers sums it up best:
Wesley Morris: Byrne’s hot dog fingers are as long and round as the singing is flat.
Kyle Buchanan: At least this number has returned inscrutable modern dance to the Oscars, where it belongs!
Most Welcome Repeat Winner: Costume Designer Ruth Carter
It was so refreshing to see Ruth Carter, the costume designer behind “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” win her second Oscar. She’s the first Black woman to win two Academy Awards — she also won for the original “Black Panther” — so she’s been on this stage before.
“Nice to see you again,” she told the crowd Sunday, and thanked the academy for recognizing the supernatural skills that every Black woman has, not just in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
She also paid tribute to her late mother who died in early March, at 101. She said “Wakanda Forever,” which begins with a funeral procession after the death of King T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman), had prepared her for her mother’s passing, and in her speech asked Boseman to watch over the matriarch.
Although Carter, who got her start designing outfits for Spike Lee in the ’80s, was the only winner among the film’s five nominations, she said she was grateful to reshape culture through film.
Something tells me this won’t be her last time on the Oscar stage. — Kalia Richardson
Most Welcome First-Timer: James Hong
There was one “Everything Everywhere” win that didn’t come with a trophy: Jimmy Kimmel’s tribute to one of the film’s stars, the 94-year-old actor James Hong.
Kimmel noted that while the Chinese American actor has starred in more than 650 films and television shows, he didn’t start acting professionally until age 25. He actually worked as a civil engineer who, Kimmel explained, helped design the road system in Los Angeles.
“James, allow me to say, you are one of our great living actors and one of our worst civil engineers. The roads are unconscionable. But we salute you, James,” Kimmel said.
Hong has gained more attention over the past year than seemingly in his entire, 69-year career, and we are here for it.
A founding member of the East-West Players theater troupe, he’s certainly among the most prolific Asian American actors ever , with credits that include “Big Trouble in Little China” and “Kung Fu Panda.” When “Everything Everywhere” won the Screen Actors Guild Award for best ensemble last month, Hong took center stage and spoke candidly about Hollywood’s racism toward Asians during the 1950s.
“But look at us now!” he said, arms upraised.
On Sunday, Hong could be seen onstage holding an Oscar, at the end of the night, when “Everything Everywhere” was named best picture. In many ways, it’s a capstone to his remarkable life and career. But let’s hope the James Hong renaissance is just getting started. — Barbara Chai This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

LOS ANGELES — At the Governors Ball after the Oscars on Sunday evening, the line for the prime rib was often longer than the one to get Oscar trophies engraved. That was fine by the winners from “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” who swarmed the second queue and were jubilant after picking up seven Academy Awards at the ceremony earlier in the evening.
Celebrating along with the “Everything Everywhere” crowd was Ke Huy Quan, the film’s supporting-actor winner, and his brother David. In his acceptance speech, the performer mentioned that David had texted his support every day. What did he text on Sunday? His brother jumped in, “I said you better mention my name!”
Elsewhere at the Governors Ball, held upstairs from the Dolby Theater, Brendan Gleeson, a supporting actor nominee for “The Banshees of Inisherin,” chowed down on some pizza while Paul Mescal (best actor nominee, “Aftersun”) popped cheese bites into his mouth before joining his mother and some friends.
When costume designer Ruth Carter won her second Oscar, for “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” she didn’t realize she had become the first Black woman to win two Academy Awards. “That’s crazy,” she said at the party. “That’s a hard act to follow. But that just means that we need more representation.”
Darren Aronofsky was in a celebratory mood because his drama “The Whale” landed two Oscars, for lead actor Brendan Fraser and for hair and makeup. “I’ve been working with that team for 25 years so that’s the bigger win for me,” Aronofsky said. Then with a wink, he added laughing, “I mean Brendan, I’ll never see that guy again.”
Cheryl Boone Isaacs, a former academy president, was up dancing with her crew and it was no wonder why: The evening went off without a hitch. Michael De Luca, a chairperson and CEO of Warner Bros. Film Group, put it succinctly, “Nobody got hit. It was a good night.”
It was the sentiment echoed by the academy CEO Bill Kramer. “We thought it was a fantastic show,” he said, adding, in reference to host Jimmy Kimmel: “Jimmy was amazing. The speeches were great, there were incredible surprises, and great diversity in the winners. We had a blast.”
Kramer, who took over the reins of the academy this past year, said he had been particularly heartened by the audience in the Dolby Theater: “It surprised me that the crowd was so engaged the entire time.”
Even CNN executive Amy Entelis, who’s been through a challenging year of her own as she watched her successful documentary division cut down as a result of the merger between Warner Media and Discovery, was in a party mood after her timely documentary “Navalny” took home the Oscar.
“It shows what the power of film can do for something that we’re all living through,” she said on her way through the ballroom to meet her filmmakers. “It’s wonderful that it’s been recognized by this film community as being as important as we thought it was. Now we have that validation.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Malachy McCourt Still Has a Few Stories Left to Tell: [Metropolitan Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The actor, writer, radio host, bartender and man about town is 91 years old, and he still has some stories to tell.
The news last summer hit his friends like a punch in the gut: Malachy McCourt had entered hospice care. It wasn't a complete surprise. Mr. McCourt was about to turn 91, and he was once known as much for his drinking as for his status as a public raconteur. He was part of a lineage that includes Jimmy Breslin and Pete Hamill, bar-stool champions of the little guy and dispensers of hard-earned wisdom.
But very soon, it seemed, the last of this breed would leave the earth. Throughout his long and colorful career, Mr. McCourt suffered many misfortunes but always bounced back. This time he would not, and another chapter in New York history would be closed.
Then on Nov. 9 came another not-quite shock: Mr. McCourt had been kicked out of hospice for not dying quickly enough.
"Who but Malachy McCourt could outrun the hospice?" said Colum McCann, the Irish-born novelist of "Let the Great World Spin," who now lives in New York and has known Mr. McCourt for more than 20 years. "Malachy was provocative before it was fashionable, using his platform to speak out about social injustice. Even in his 90s, he supports young talent, especially in the Irish American community. He has helped us uncover what it means to be an immigrant away from home, how one exists in new space, always pushing the edge."
Later I heard from the actor Liam Neeson, who shared much of Mr. McCann's warm sentiments. "Malachy has always reminded me of a type of Merlin," Mr. Neeson said, "a wise one with a delicious sense of humor."
I, too, have been privileged to know Malachy McCourt for quite some time. His more famous brother Frank -- who wrote the best seller about their childhood, "Angela's Ashes" -- taught creative writing at Stuyvesant High School from 1972 to 1987. I took his class in 1981, when I was 15. He became my mentor, and I came to know the McCourt clan. I volunteered to produce two microbudget documentaries for Conor McCourt, Malachy's son, during the mid-1990s. Malachy transformed my mother's somber Jewish funeral service into a lively Irish wake -- at her request.
When I heard he was dying, I asked if he was up for an "exit interview." He laughed and assured me he was eager to beat his obit. "But hurry up, love," he warned. He was worried he might not see another St. Patrick's Day.
I soon found myself in Mr. McCourt's Upper West Side living room. He sat in the electric wheelchair he has needed since 2021, surrounded by books and keepsakes, including a poster from his 2006 Green Party run for New York governor with his long-shot slogan: "Don't Waste Your Vote, Give It to Me."
The once plump and cheerful New York storyteller was now gaunt and cheerful. He explained he had a heart condition, skin and prostate cancer, and muscular degeneration. "I was doing OK at first," Mr. McCourt said, "before I slipped and broke my leg on my way to bed."
In his soft brogue, he played the hits, starting with his birth in Brooklyn in 1931, the second son of Irish immigrants. After his baby sister's crib death, the grieving family returned to Ireland on a steamboat. Just 3 years old, Malachy roamed the decks, singing the song "Paddy Reilly" for bread and jam.
This time in Ireland is well documented in "Angela's Ashes." The family of six slept in one cramped room. Frank and Malachy, the oldest boys, shared a bed with their twin brothers, who later died six months apart at age 4. The fragile mother, Angela, entered a catatonic state, smoking Woodbines and staring blankly into the fire, lost in grief.
Years later, on a rare sunny day in Limerick in 1952, Malachy, then 20, kissed his mother goodbye. Frank had returned to America first and sent his brother the $ 200 liner fare. Malachy expected to see him when he arrived at the docks, but Frank had already joined the U.S. Army and been shipped to Germany. A friend Malachy met on the boat helped him get a job on Welfare Island (which was later renamed Roosevelt Island) as a dishwasher and cleaner for $ 35 a week. This was enormous money in his mind; it was enough to rent a furnished room in Manhattan on Third Avenue and 58th Street.
"Soon after I arrived," Mr. McCourt told me, "I discovered that my literary hero, P.G. Wodehouse, was listed at 1000 Park Avenue in the Manhattan directory. So I rang him. And he said, 'Wodehouse!' And I said, 'McCourt!' And he replied, 'Yes, sir, what can I do for you?' And I replied, 'Yes, sir, you brightened my life and my brothers' lives in Ireland with your writing.' He replied, 'Very good.' I took that as a positive and said, 'I'd love to meet you sometime.' 'Well,' he said, 'I am rather busy, but thank you for asking."'
Third Avenue in Manhattan in that era was crowded with Irish bars with neon shamrocks. It was in a pub conversation with a New York rugby pal that Mr. McCourt scored a free summer share on Fire Island, where he sold Bibles on the beach for extra cash. During the summer of 1956, he met a couple of young writers for "The Tonight Show," who thought that the new host, Jack Paar, would love the way this young Irishman could tell a story.
In the spring of 1958, Mr. McCourt made his debut on "The Tonight Show." Despite being visibly intoxicated, he captivated Mr. Paar with a wild tale about how he avoided paying the electric company by sending his bills back after stamping them with the word "deceased," sparking a national trend and his public career.
Following his TV appearances, an entrepreneurial couple offered Mr. McCourt a partnership in a pub on 63rd Street and Third Avenue as long as he worked behind the bar. Malachy's Pub opened on May 12, 1958. When White Rock Beverages launched a national ad campaign featuring Mr. McCourt as "America's most famous bartender," celebrities like Grace Kelly, Audrey Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton started showing up.
At this time, ostensibly to discourage prostitution, women were prohibited from sitting alone at a bar. Mr. McCourt defied convention by welcoming anyone to sit and chat, inadvertently creating what some say was the first singles bar in New York. It was especially popular with the women from the ladies-only Hotel Barbizon across the street; they would sneak out after curfew, the story goes, wearing only raincoats -- with nothing underneath.
One day at Malachy's, Linda Wachsman, a striking model who went by the name Linda Claire, caught his eye from across the bar. They soon married and had a daughter, Siobhan, in 1959, and a son, Malachy Jr., a year later. However, Mr. McCourt's repeated infidelities and heavy drinking led to their separation in 1961.
Here, Mr. McCourt paused his monologue and grimaced. "It still shames me," he said. "I was a mule."
In October 1963, after his excessive drinking led to him being fired from the bar that bore his name, he stole back into his apartment -- Linda had kicked him out -- and drunkenly threatened to kidnap their children. He was arrested and held overnight on $ 1,000 bail. Even after his release, he spiraled further out of control; after meeting a man in an uptown bar with a shady scheme, he agreed to smuggle gold to India, where it sold for twice as much as in the West. He didn't care if he was caught, he said, risking years in prison.
By the end of that tumultuous year, Mr. McCourt was the part-owner of a new pub called Himself. He remarried in 1965, to a woman named Diana Galin, and was eager to leave the bar scene after he and his customers were held hostage during a robbery. (Two days later, he said, the same robbers killed another bartender in the neighborhood.)
Mr. McCourt had been making occasional TV appearances, and he jumped at the chance to host a talk show, "Sound Off With Malachy McCourt," on Channel 9 in New York. His first show, on Sept. 9, 1968, featured the actors Richard Harris and Sean Connery. The next guests included Muhammad Ali, who had refused to fight in Vietnam, Betty Friedan and the Columbia University students who had protested by barricading themselves in their dean's office. After a deluge of angry calls to the station's owner, "Sound Off" was canceled 10 days after it went on the air.
Mr. McCourt landed a couple of commercials (Imperial Margarine and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups), and he was nearly cast as Father Mulcahy in Robert Altman's "M*A*S*H," but he could not quite make it as a performer.
Then, in the 1970s, his luck turned. After scoring a radio slot on WMCA, Mr. McCourt also gained new fame as Kevin the bartender on the ABC soap opera "Ryan's Hope." By the end of the decade, he and his brother Frank started performing "A Couple of Blaguards," a storytelling show about their bumpy lives. The show became a modest hit at the Village Gate downtown. Stuyvesant High School hosted a special presentation for students when I was a junior.
When I met him in the 1980s, his energy was practically perpetual, but at this point in the conversation, all the talking and reminiscing seemed to have tired him out, and he needed a break.
Conor McCourt stopped by to update his father on his St. Patrick's schedule. He was to march (by wheelchair) during St. Pat's For All, an inclusive alternative to the traditional Fifth Avenue parade. He and other Irish American dignitaries would have breakfast with Mayor Eric Adams at Gracie Mansion.
Conor recalled his dad's role in "The Dain Curse," a 1970s mini-series. His father had to shave off his trademark red beard for the part, and Conor and his younger brother, Cormac, did not recognize him at the door. When they realized who he was, they fell down laughing and called, "Mom! Dad has a visitor!" Mr. McCourt grinned at the memory. "And she introduced herself as Mrs. McCourt before the shock registered," he added.
Bad habits don't change with a fresh shave. It wasn't until the death of his estranged, alcoholic father in 1985 that Mr. McCourt stopped drinking.
But the biggest change would come a decade later, when "Angela's Ashes" came out. There was a 25,000 first printing for his brother's book, and expectations were modest. It was a runaway best seller and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1997. The once-anonymous Frank McCourt was now lionized by presidents and movie stars.
"The twins died and my father deserted us in Limerick," Mr. McCourt recalled. "So when Frank got accolades and celebrity treatment, I felt like he earned it all because, as a child, my big brother worked and earned money and gave it all to Angela, which allowed us to eat." Long the star in the family, Malachy was now known as "Frank's brother."
"Which stung," he said. "But just a bit." In 1998, Malachy's own memoir, "A Monk Swimming," hit the best-seller list, reducing residual jealousy.
Frank died in 2009, and then his two youngest brothers, Mike and Alphie, died shortly after.
"Every day I wake up at 91, I am happy without a coffin over my head," he said. "I don't know where I'm going, but I do know from whence I came. I'm a New Yorker, born, half-bred and bred, who outlived my brothers and closest friends." He was grateful, he added, for the companionship of his wife Diana, whom he described as his "great love."
Mr. McCourt tries to maintain his public life, and now that he's no longer in hospice, he has resumed his role as a co-host of a Sunday morning radio show on WBAI.
In early March, he was invited to attend opening night of Craic Fest, an Irish film and music festival that was celebrating its 25th year in New York. The movie showing that night was a documentary about Richard Harris. Introducing the film was the Irish filmmaker Jim Sheridan (who once cast Mr. McCourt in "The Field," a 1990 film starring Mr. Harris).
Just as the lights were about to dim, Mr. McCourt wheeled himself into great applause, with Siobhan, Conor and two of his nine grandchildren following him. Mr. Sheridan's face glowed with pride and relief. "It wouldn't be a party," he announced, "without Malachy McCourt."

Judy Blume Was Always Here. Hollywood Just Noticed.: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The lunches Judy Blume used to have in Hollywood would all go the same way, she said. "Judy, sweetheart, what would you like to do?" the men would ask -- and they were always men. "We want to work with you. How do you want to adapt your books?" This began in the 1970s and continued for decades. She had already sold millions of copies, on her way to her current tally of more than 90 million worldwide.
But she didn't know what a Judy Blume movie should be. She was young when she first took the meetings. As the years went on, she kept writing while navigating two tumultuous divorces, newfound fame, and the relentless attacks by the religious right and its crusade to ban her books -- books that in Ms. Blume's quest to honestly depict the teenage experience dared to frankly discuss masturbation, menstruation and sexual desire, topics, among others, that made teens feel seen.
Some things were produced, mostly for television, including the 1978 made-for-TV movie based on the novel "Forever." In 1991, "Otherwise Known as Sheila the Great" became an ABC Weekend Special directed by her son, Larry Blume. A television sitcom, "Fudge," aired on ABC for two years in the mid-90s.
Yet so much was never made.
"Somebody used to say to me, 'Just wait till all these kids who grew up with you get to those positions of power in Hollywood -- you will see,"' Ms. Blume, now 85, said. "Of course, that is what happened. And I'm glad I'm still here to see it."
The Judy Blume Renaissance is upon us.
In April, Amazon Prime Video will release "Judy Blume Forever," a documentary by the filmmakers Davina Pardo and Leah Wolchok that tracks the effect that Ms. Blume's work has had on generations. The film features luminaries like the actress Molly Ringwald, the author Jason Reynolds and the filmmaker Lena Dunham, while also examining the surprising correspondence that Ms. Blume engaged in with thousands of readers, some of which lasted decades and sometimes dealt with issues of personal trauma. This was not just about writing to an author to ask about what happened to a beloved character after the last chapter.
Then on April 28, Lionsgate will debut in theaters "Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret," arguably Ms. Blume's most beloved novel -- and the one she was most reluctant to adapt. Ms. Blume softened her stance on turning the novel, about an 11-year-old girl grappling with her developing body while questioning the constraints of organized religion, into a movie after the filmmaker Kelly Fremon Craig ("The Edge of Seventeen") sent the author an impassioned email and she and the veteran producer James L. Brooks ventured to Ms. Blume's home in Key West, Fla., to make their case in person.
Also in the works are an animated film based on Ms. Blume's "Superfudge" book that will be produced by Joe and Anthony Russo ("Avengers: Endgame") for Disney+ and a Netflix series inspired by "Forever" that Mara Brock Akil ("Girlfriends") will oversee. And the long-gestating "Summer Sisters," which originally was set up as a Hulu series, is now being produced by Jenna Bush Hager at Peacock.
The author Mark Oppenheimer has begun working on her biography.
In Ms. Blume's mind, the newfound attention is based not on the booming streaming market and its insatiable quest for material but rather on nostalgia writ large. It doesn't hurt that her books still sell well today. As Mr. Reynolds says in the documentary: "I don't think that Judy Blume wrote her books to be timeless. I think she wrote her books to be timely, and they were so timely that they became timeless."
"I mean, they need content; I have books," she said. "But I really do think it's that they grew up, and they are in more powerful positions."
From 'no' to 'yes' in Hollywood
For the children growing up in the '80s, Judy Blume was the ultimate confidante. She was there for you when you got your period -- or when you were wondering why it was taking so long. She explained masturbation without making you feel ashamed. And in the fictional worlds she created, she allowed teenagers to have responsible, consensual sex without anything bad happening to them.
Through her novels, Ms. Blume has served as a guidepost for generations of children who needed answers when their grown-ups were keeping secrets. By honoring the complex, interior lives of young readers, she gave rise to the young adult genre of literature and compelled us to never look at the name Ralph the same way again. ("Forever" readers understand.)
Yet as beloved as she is -- and she is beloved, just ask her husband of 35 years, George Cooper, who talks about fans he calls the "OMG criers" who come to her bookstore in Key West asking to meet her and then promptly burst into tears in her presence -- she has never received the red carpet welcome from Hollywood when it came to adapting her books into films or television shows. And she tried.
At one point, Ms. Blume thought about moving to Los Angeles to work with the producer Edgar Scherick ("Shoot the Moon"), but her children were young and she was raising them in New Mexico. The megaproducer Aaron Spelling offered her $ 100,000 for "Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret" and another $ 100,000 for "Then Again Maybe I Won't." That didn't come together, either.
"That was a lot of money back then," Ms. Blume said.
In 2004, Ms. Blume rewrote the script for "Deenie," a story about a 13-year-old with modeling aspirations who is diagnosed with scoliosis, for Disney, only to have it fall by the wayside when the studio switched its attention toward blockbusters. "There have been a lot of almosts, a lot of maybes," Ms. Blume told The New York Times back then. Her son directed a film version of "Tiger Eyes," but it didn't do much to move the needle, grossing only $ 27,000 on tepid reviews.
"I was longing for somebody to say, 'Judy, sweetheart, this is what we want to do,"' she says now. "I don't know why things never worked. Eventually you just say, 'Eh, you know, let me write my books."'
But now, Ms. Blume said, she is finished writing. Her last book was the 2015 adult novel "In the Unlikely Event," a fictionalized account of the three plane crashes that occurred in her childhood hometown, Elizabeth, N.J., in the span of eight weeks in the early 1950s. Her focus is centered on adapting her works into films and television shows. Armed with an agent who understands her influence and scrutinizes any potential collaboration, Ms. Blume is finally, it seems, receiving the proper recognition in Hollywood.
"I sure have heroine worship when it comes to her," said Mr. Brooks, who produced Ms. Fremon Craig's adaptation of "Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret." "I've adapted books before, but I'll never know another stress like doing right by her. You can't be the person who let down Judy Blume, about anything, ever."
Ms. Blume's resurgence began with boxes of fudge. Jill Gillett, Ms. Blume's new agent at her longtime home, WME, had a grand plan for today's world of prestige programming -- an entire collection on Netflix or Hulu dedicated to Ms. Blume's vast bibliography. Ms. Gillett's colleagues wrangled the chocolate, and the group went on a road show to sell this sweet plan to the streaming services.
"Everybody was interested; everybody wanted to do her works," Ms. Gillett said. "And they asked me what I was looking for. And I said, 'Millions, many millions of dollars.' It was crickets. I was way too lofty."
Ms. Gillett was pitching places that have, in fact, paid many millions of dollars for a revered talent. Think Netflix's $ 100 million deal with Shonda Rhimes, the prolific television creator of such shows as "Grey's Anatomy" and "Scandal." But that wasn't how the Blume-aissance was going to work. Instead, the effort became a piecemeal enterprise. A passionate email here. A fortuitous meeting there. Despite a handful of starts and stops because of the pandemic and its overhang, we will soon be awash in Judy Blume projects, both those about the beloved author and adaptations of her treasured tomes.
Ms. Gillett confirmed that nostalgia had played a big part in how these deals were made. Nostalgia, specifically for entertainment from the '80s and '90s, has fueled some recent Hollywood hits like "Top Gun: Maverick," which earned $ 718 million, and this year's Oscar race, which has three stars from the '90s nominated -- Jamie Lee Curtis, Ke Huy Quan and Brendan Fraser. Yet the relationship that executives say they have with Ms. Blume is far more personal.
Just ask Susan Rovner, chairman of entertainment content at NBC, who is redeveloping "Summer Sisters" for its streaming service. The executive, who oversees all programming on NBC's linear channels and its streaming service, Peacock, talks about how "Deenie" saved her during her teenage years. As a girl growing up in Roslyn, N.Y., Ms. Rovner turned to Ms. Blume's 1973 book about a 13-year-old people pleaser with an unfortunate scoliosis diagnosis. "Deenie" was Ms. Rovner's salve, especially in the '80s when bulky back braces were the butt of so many jokes. (Think Joan Cusack in "Sixteen Candles.")
"I brought that book to college with me," she said. "Honest to god, it got me through my teen years." And to this day, she added, whenever she has a conversation with the higher power, she begins it with "Are you there God? It's me, Susan."
"So yes, Judy might be right," she continued. "Those books really spoke to women my age. And it's not until recently that we've been in positions of power to do something about it."
Who Judy Blume was to her readers
Quick-witted and sweet with an almost encyclopedic memory of her past and an insatiable curiosity about her present, Ms. Blume is exactly who you want her to be. Her airy apartment on the Upper West Side overlooks Central Park with a view that allows her and Mr. Cooper to see all the sunbathers and picnickers lounging on the grass. (You can almost picture the idlers thumbing through a Judy Blume novel.)
Books new and old are stacked on her coffee table. The best-selling novel "Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow," by Gabrielle Zevin, has a prominent spot, while an entire wall is dedicated to "his and hers" bookshelves: Ms. Blume's side is filled with fiction, everyone from Joyce Carol Oates to Philip Roth, and Mr. Cooper, a former Columbia law professor, has his side crammed with nonfiction titles.
Ms. Blume spends most of her time now in Florida, but in the fall she was in her New York City apartment for her annual doctors' visits and to enjoy the weather. She was also recovering from an infection that left her gasping for breath and questioning just how much time she had left.
"This really shook me," she said of her illness. "At 84, being that sick, it's a whole different thing."
And yet she is still not eager to analyze her legacy, hemming and hawing when asked why her books have endured through generations of readers.
Others will do so, happily.
The documentarians Ms. Pardo and Ms. Wolchok described how people would come up to them during each of the Sundance screenings of their film that they attended, with tears in their eyes wanting to talk.
"I don't think we realized how emotionally resonant the film would be with people," Ms. Wolchok said.
"I think part of it is the power of feeling seen and understood, and being taken back to a moment where you felt that, where you felt safe," Ms. Pardo said. "I think reconnecting with Judy's work takes you back to your childhood and, in a very specific way, to how you felt as a child."
Mark Oppenheimer, who first wrote about Ms. Blume in a 1997 essay for The Times, had been trying fruitlessly for the past decade to get her to agree to a biography, before she signed on last year. "I've been thinking about her work, and why it succeeds and its literary merits in some ways, since I was 10 years old," he said. "She's a tremendously important woman of letters. She is one of a very small number of people who have written exceedingly well, and with great success, for multiple age groups."
The world is a very different place from when Ms. Blume began writing over 50 years ago. Children searching for answers don't need Judy Blume to help them; they have Google. Yet book sales are still robust. According to Justin Chanda, a senior vice president at Simon & Schuster, the portion of Ms. Blume's catalog that the publishing house oversees, which includes the majority of her young adult titles except the "Fudge" series and a few others, sells 200,000 to 250,000 copies a year, with "Freckle Juice" being the best seller. Mr. Chanda adds that since publicity has begun on the "Margaret" film, sales of the 50-year-old novel have shot up 762 percent from a year ago.
Ms. Blume chalked it all up to children's insatiable curiosity that she believed was still not being satisfied by the internet. "They still say, 'Nobody is answering my questions, and nobody is telling me what it is I really want to know,"' she said.
Letters from children still arrived, though not as many as before and not as urgent as they once were. She's rarely called on to save anyone's life. The recent letters are more about her books' characters and stories. All the correspondence today happens on a computer, a technological advance that she believes creates more distance between people and their emotions.
Yet Ms. Fremon Craig said test screenings of "Margaret" had evoked a wistfulness among middle school readers for a time they never even lived through, a yearning, if possible, for a world where technology and social media didn't rule their lives.
"There is this feeling of wishing that they lived through it and also this weird, strange nostalgia that sort of feels like their own memory, but it is a step removed," she said.
Judy Blume's finale
As much as things have changed, so much remains the same. Ms. Blume's books are still some of the most banned in the country -- "Margaret," "Forever" and "Deenie" are perennial targets. It's an issue that still fires up the octogenarian.
"It's better because we're talking about it," she said. "It's worse, because it's so politicized. It was awful in the '80s. This is even bigger. And scarier. And more polarizing."
I asked Ms. Blume if any of her characters ever had an abortion -- a third-rail topic at the time and one with renewed resonance today in the wake of the recent Supreme Court ruling. She paused for a bit, recalled that it was discussed in "Forever" when Katherine goes to Planned Parenthood, but that was it -- in her novels anyway.
"I've had two, and you can write that," she said, pausing. "Both were during the horrible second marriage, when it just would have been a disaster. They weren't emotional moments for me at all. They were just something that needed to be done. I never thought of that as a baby. It's not a baby. It's a clump of cells."
It's at this moment that I realize that this diminutive, soft-spoken author, who wrote thoughtful, insightful books for middle school students when it wasn't even kosher for women to have a career outside the home, has long been a trailblazer in the fight for equality and body autonomy before it was a buzzword -- both in her writing and in her personal life. You want to be around her because it's almost a miracle that she exists.
"One of the real gifts of Judy is that she is, as a person, as approachable as her books are," Ms. Fremon Craig said.
Mr. Brooks added: "When you meet people who are thought of as national treasures and the experience confirms it, I don't think that is usual. She's a credit to national treasures."
And yet, in her presence, it's the furthest thing from her mind. The question of societal impact is met with a pat answer. "That's for somebody else to do," she said. "I've got family. They are my legacy."
Then in a follow-up email she added: "I've been thinking a lot about the question you asked about 'my legacy.' It embarrassed me when you asked so I dodged an answer. I still think my readers will say it better than I can. For me it's about having touched lives. So unexpected when I started to write. It still makes me wonder how this ever happened."

Hey, That Red Carpet Isn’t Red!

There are some fundamental truths in the world: The sky is blue. The grass is green. The Oscars red carpet is re —— champagne-colored.
Jimmy Kimmel, this year’s host, joked at the unveiling Thursday that the color change — the first time in more than six decades that the academy’s arrival rug will not be red — had been prompted by Will Smith slapping the comedian Chris Rock across the face onstage at last year’s ceremony.
“I think the decision to go with a champagne carpet rather than a red carpet shows just how confident we are that no blood will be shed,” he said.
Oscars organizers said they wanted the rug to be mellow, like a beach at sunset.
The 50,000-square-foot rug, which was created in a color chosen by the academy, is the latest in a trend of colorful carpets sweeping premieres, galas and award ceremonies across the country, from the Emmys (gold) to the Golden Globes (gray) to the purple-carpeted world premiere of “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” in Los Angeles in November.
“Every year, a new color will be a hot color,” said Steve Olive, president of Event Carpet Pros, the company that has manufactured the carpet for the Oscars for more than 20 years, as well as events on both coasts including the Golden Globes, the Emmy Awards, the Grammy Awards and thousands of movie premieres. “This year seems to be a lot of lavender,” he said. (Red, he notes, is still the most popular color, though black, white and gray are gaining on it.)
For the Oscars production team, which chose the champagne color, the priority was a light, “soothing” color that would not clash with the orange tent that will be erected over the carpet to shield attendees from the sun and potential rain. “The sienna-color tent and champagne-colored carpet was inspired by watching the sunset on a white-sand beach at the ‘golden hour’ with a glass of champagne in hand, evoking calm and peacefulness,” she said in an interview Thursday.
The red carpet traces its origins back to 458 B.C., when it appeared in the Aeschylus play “Agamemnon.” When the Greek king Agamemnon returns home victorious from the Trojan War, his vengeful wife, Clytemnestra, tries to trick him into arrogance by laying out a red carpet for him to walk on, an action that, undertaken by a mere mortal, would court the wrath of the gods. (He takes the bait and, shortly afterward, she murders him in a bathtub.)
Red carpets have been a staple at premieres and galas since 1922, when the showman Sid Grauman rolled one out for the 1922 premiere of “Robin Hood,” which starred Douglas Fairbanks, at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood. The Oscars adopted it beginning with the 1961 ceremony, and, ever since, the special shade — known as Academy Red — has been instantly recognizable in photos.
But beginning about 15 years ago, at events across the country, producers began opting for more vibrant and varied fare, Olive said. There are the Met Gala’s pink and red, white and blue carpets, and Disney’s blue (“Moana” and “Avatar: The Way of Water”), white with black thorns (“Maleficent: Mistress of Evil”) and green (“Pete’s Dragon”) carpets for its premieres.
“It’s important for us as creatives and producers to create visuals that stand out from each other,” said Keith Baptista, a partner at the creative agency Prodject, which handles design and management for events such as the LACMA Art + Film Gala and the MoMA Film Benefit, and works with companies including Chanel, Gucci and Ralph Lauren. “You want to be able to look at something at a quick glance and go, ‘That was the Met Gala’ or ‘That was Vanity Fair.’”
Mindi Weiss, an event planner who has worked with the Kardashians, Justin Bieber and Ellen DeGeneres, pointed to another consideration: How the carpet will photograph. Red, she said, tradition aside, is simply not flattering.
“The color of red carpets has changed because of fashion,” she said. “It has to match the dresses, and the red clashed.”
In fact, event planners say trends in carpet colors now correlate with trends on the runways.
“It all goes back to fashion and style and trendsetting,” Weiss said. “The carpet should reflect the fashion that’s going to walk down it and not fight with it.”
But a striking color does not always complement what celebrities are wearing, Baptista said — or photograph well. The wrong tone of gold, for instance, can wash out a photo, said Stephanie Goodell, who has led what the Television Academy refers to as its “SWATCH” team for the Emmys for the past seven years. To head off any issues, production companies do extensive lighting, color and even footprint testing beforehand, and warn stylists.
“We’re in constant communication with publicists before the show,” Goodell said. “We always want to make sure they know exactly what we’re dealing with because they do select fashion based on the color of the carpet.”
Planning teams for big-ticket events generally begin considering the carpet — the color, material, length, width and pile type — six months to a year before the event. They also look for other ways to stand out, such as inscribing a logo or lettering on the carpet, Baptista said.
“Sometimes we’ll see people use grass, especially for summertime events,” he said. Then, for the background, “a lot of people use hedgerows, so it’s just greenery and it becomes neutral. Sometimes, there’s no logo,” he said.
For the Oscars, Olive got the call that carpet would be champagne about 45 days before the show. He rushed to get the three-week manufacturing process underway, which takes place at a mill in Dalton, Georgia, before the carpet is trucked across the country to Los Angeles, which takes about a week.
So what happens to the carpet after Cate Blanchett and Austin Butler have strolled it?
Its future, Olive said, does not lie in an industrial-size dumpster. The polyester-based, sisal-style rug is made from recycled materials and is recycled after the event, possibly beginning life anew as wall insulation or carpet padding, Olive said.
But first, it has to look sharp on the big night. So, was this year’s Oscars squad worried that the champagne carpet — the kind of flooring that screams “Shoes-off house!” — would get dirty?
“It will probably get dirty — maybe it wasn’t the best choice,” Love said. “We’ll see!” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Group Black Is a Suitor To Buy BET: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Black Entertainment Television made the first Black billionaire in the United States. Will a Black executive buy it back?
When the cable giant Viacom bought Black Entertainment Television at the turn of the millennium for $ 2.34 billion, it made Robert L. Johnson, BET's founder, the first Black billionaire in the United States.
Since then, the fortunes of cable TV have waned. Viewers have abandoned traditional television in droves, and Black-owned media organizations in the United States, which were already scarce, have continued to dwindle.
But in recent days, Paramount -- as Viacom is now known -- has begun to explore selling a major stake in BET and its sister network, VH1, attracting entrepreneurs who would return the network to Black ownership. Tyler Perry, the actor and director who created the popular "Madea" franchise, has expressed interest in a bid, as has Byron Allen, who owns the Weather Channel.
Now, a third suitor has emerged, according to three people with knowledge of the sale process. Group Black, a media company in Miami run by Black executives, has expressed interest in a bid with CVC Capital Partners, a private-equity firm based in Luxembourg with more than $ 100 billion under management. To round out its bid, Group Black, led by Travis Montaque, the chief executive, has begun reaching out to prominent Black businesspeople and artists to team up.
Talks to sell BET are still in their early stages, and Paramount may ultimately decide not to sell ownership of BET or VH1 to any of the companies. Paramount declined to comment for this article. The company's chief executive, Bob Bakish, has said the company will not discuss sensitive dealmaking details publicly.
But the company is exploring a sale of ownership in BET and VH1 during a renewed push to support Black-owned and controlled media companies.
"There's real interest in having the independence to do the things that you want to do for your community and not having to answer to white people to do that," said Lauren Williams, who started Capital B, a news nonprofit controlled by Black journalists, in January 2022.
Since BET sold to Viacom in 2000, the number of Black-owned media companies has fallen sharply, said Jeffrey Blevins, a professor at the University of Cincinnati who has researched the subject. In the 1990s, Washington lawmakers repealed a tax policy benefiting minority owners and passed a law that cleared the way for TV station groups to buy out their rivals. Numerous smaller minority-owned groups then sold to companies controlled by white executives.
Each known suitor for BET brings different strengths. Mr. Perry is a bold-face name with a track record of producing popular TV shows and movies for BET. Mr. Allen has experience operating traditional TV networks, and he could bundle them with his existing channels, which include Comedy.tv and Pets.tv.
Group Black has connections with potential advertisers on BET. Over the last two years, the company struck agreements with agencies to spend more than $ 500 million in advertising on its properties, according to two people with knowledge of the deals. The ad contracts are contingent on Group Black's finding a suitable media partner; it recently submitted a bid to acquire Vice.
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that Mr. Perry and Mr. Allen were interested in acquiring majority stakes in BET and VH1.
Like all cable networks, BET has been losing traditional TV viewership in recent years as viewers have turned to streaming services. According to Nielsen data, BET's average daily audience has decreased about 20 percent since 2000. Its annual profit fell to $ 205 million last year from its peak of $ 319 million in 2013, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Those numbers do not include the BET+ streaming service or the network's studio business.
Splitting BET and VH1 off from Paramount's portfolio of cable networks defies the conventional wisdom of the traditional TV business. Corporations like Disney, NBCUniversal and Paramount have accumulated large portfolios of cable networks, betting that they can drive a harder bargain with cable providers if they have a wide variety of popular content. But cable providers might be reluctant to drop BET and VH1, even if they are not part of a large company, because the networks are among the few that cater to Black audiences.
Ms. Williams of Capital B said Black-owned media companies had a greater ability to connect to Black audiences and reinvest in the Black community.
"Black ownership is important in commercial enterprises," she said, "because Black people should be profiting from Black products."

For Oscars, A Reboot. (Again.): [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The awards telecast has been losing viewers for years. New leadership wants to reverse that starting Sunday, and ensure the financial well-being of the organization.
The stage design for the 95th Academy Awards on Sunday is more Doctor Strange modern and less Dowager Countess musty. That means plentiful video screens, including ones that cover the sides of the theater, with nary a Swarovski crystal curtain -- the old standby -- to be seen.
In a change from last year, when eight categories were awarded during a nontelevised portion, all of the Oscars will be handed out live on air. To make the telecast interactive and help viewers better understand crafts categories, such as sound mixing and art direction, QR codes will appear before commercial breaks to direct viewers to internet vignettes about the nominees and behind-the-scenes footage and photos.
To reinvigorate the red carpet preshow, Oscars organizers hired members of the Met Gala creative team. Expect much more star power, specialized lighting (to make a process that happens in daylight seem more like evening) and better integration with the theater's entrance.
But some of the most important changes -- part of an urgent effort to make the Academy Awards more relevant to young people and draw a broader international audience -- involve things that most viewers won't notice. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will post video of acceptance speeches in the six biggest categories in near real time on TikTok and Facebook, and all speeches will quickly be posted on Twitter. In a first, Disney+ will stream the Oscars show live in parts of Europe.
The academy has also sought out new marketing partners like Letterboxd, a social media site for movie fans (8.4 million members, most of them ages 18 to 34), in a sad-but-true admission that it must convince people that they should care about the Oscars.
"We didn't have to before," Janet Yang, the academy's president, said in an interview at the organization's Beverly Hills offices. "We could rest on our laurels and just let it carry itself."
One might respond with exasperation: You're only now figuring that out? Perhaps the time to pull out all the stops to keep the Oscars vibrant was five years ago, when the telecast, for the first time, attracted fewer than 30 million people, a 20 percent decline from the previous year.
Since then, the number of viewers for the Academy Awards has dropped another 37 percent, according to Nielsen's data. About 16.6 million people watched "CODA" win the Oscar for best picture at the most recent ceremony, with viewership swelling after Will Smith slapped Chris Rock onstage late in the show.
But Ms. Yang can't be held responsible. She was elected president only in August. The academy also has a new chief executive for the first time in 11 years; Bill Kramer, the former director of the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, was appointed to that role in June. Together, Ms. Yang and Mr. Kramer have brought a blast of fresh air to the stuffy organization, working to improve transparency, calm a membership revolt over last year's removal of several categories from the live Oscars telecast and shore up the academy's wobbly finances.
In the past, Ms. Yang said, "a lot of cultural institutions felt like they should be sitting on a hill, a little bit more protected, almost untouchable." She added that the academy itself felt "ivory tower-ish," but that it was now "a different time" and "a different culture."
ABC has exclusive rights to broadcast the Oscars ceremony until 2028 and provides the academy with about 80 percent of its annual revenue. Last year, Oscar-related revenue was $ 137.1 million, according to financial disclosures. Awards-related expenses totaled $ 56.8 million.
The TV network generated an estimated $ 139 million across 70 commercials during last year's show, according to Vivvix, which tracks ad spending. (To compare, ABC pulled in about $ 129 million across 56 ads in 2020.) A red carpet preshow brought in an additional $ 16 million in advertising revenue.
To secure a distribution contract of similar value when its deal with ABC expires, the academy must reverse viewership declines. A less lucrative deal could imperil some of the organization's year-round activities, including film restoration.
"This is so important to the livelihood and future of the organization that we better confront it," Ms. Yang said.
In many ways, however, the academy is hamstrung when it comes to reinventing the Oscars telecast.
ABC and other traditional television networks are shadows of their former selves, with younger audiences in particular decamping en masse to streaming services. Some other awards shows are following them, notably the Screen Actors Guild Awards, which will stream live on Netflix starting next year. After an ethics, finance and diversity scandal, the Golden Globe Awards, long broadcast on NBC, are also looking for a new distribution partner.
Many viewers have long complained that the Oscars ceremony is overlong, with groan-inducing banter between presenters adding to a feeling of bloat. Last year's Academy Awards was three and a half hours, despite moving eight of the 23 awards off the live broadcast. (The offscreen acceptance speeches were recorded, edited and incorporated into the live show.) In the past, the Oscars telecast has run as long as four hours and 23 minutes.
Jimmy Kimmel will return as the host on Sunday, having served as M.C. in 2017 and 2018, and he has been planning a traditional monologue.
"We are working very hard to deliver the show on time with all disciplines honored," Mr. Kramer said.
Linda Ong, the chief executive of Cultique, a consulting firm in Los Angeles that advises companies on changing cultural norms, said people were still interested in the award show's winners and the things they had to say. The problem for the academy, she said, is that "people don't feel the need to watch the show to be part of the conversation."
"They just watch some clips on social," she added.
Ms. Ong noted that, in a once-unthinkable move that speaks to the Oscars' fading relevancy, the season finale of HBO's hugely popular post-apocalyptic drama, "The Last of Us," will broadcast head-to-head against the ceremony.
"That's a big cultural tell," she said.
The academy is hopeful that Nielsen's ratings meters for the Oscars will tick upward on Sunday. Big musical stars, including Rihanna, are scheduled to perform their nominated songs; Lenny Kravitz will perform during the "In Memoriam" segment. Lady Gaga will be absent, though, with Oscars producers saying on Wednesday that she was too busy filming a movie to perform her nominated song from "Top Gun: Maverick."
The nominee pool for best picture has never before included more than one billion-dollar ticket seller, according to box office databases, and this year there are two. "Top Gun: Maverick" collected $ 1.5 billion, and "Avatar: The Way of Water" took in $ 2.3 billion. The front-runner for best picture, "Everything Everywhere All at Once," generated $ 104 million in ticket sales. (Viewership tends to increase when popular films are nominated.)
But the academy says it's not just about TV anymore -- that relying on Nielsen's numbers alone to assess relevancy is outdated, and that online chatter and streaming-service viewing should also be taken into account.
"We have to rethink our success metrics," Mr. Kramer said, noting that the Oscars will be available for viewing on Hulu the next day.
Conversations on social media during and after award shows can be significant. Last month's Grammy Awards, for instance, attracted about 12.6 million viewers. On the day of the ceremony and the next day, the Grammys generated about seven million mentions on Twitter, according to ListenFirst, an analytics company.
If nothing else, the academy is hoping for a smooth show on Sunday. In the past, the academy started to plan for the Oscars as late as November. This time, planning started in June.
"It should be about unity and celebrating this industry," Mr. Kramer said. "People are still consuming movies. People love movies. Perhaps they're doing it on streaming more than they did a few years ago. But our art form is as relevant as ever."

The stage design for the 95th Academy Awards on Sunday is more Doctor Strange modern and less Dowager Countess musty. That means plentiful video screens, including ones that cover the sides of the theater, with nary a Swarovski crystal curtain — the old standby — to be seen.
Unlike last year, when eight categories were awarded during a nontelevised portion, all of the Oscars will be handed out live on air. To make the telecast interactive and help viewers better understand crafts categories, such as sound mixing and art direction, QR codes will appear before commercial breaks to direct viewers to internet vignettes about the nominees and behind-the-scenes footage and photos.
To reinvigorate the red carpet preshow, Oscars organizers hired members of the Met Gala creative team. Expect much more star power, specialized lighting (to make a process that happens in daylight seem more like evening) and better integration with the theater’s entrance.
But some of the most important changes — part of an urgent effort to help make the Academy Awards more relevant to young people and draw a broader international audience — involve things that most viewers won’t notice. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will post video of acceptance speeches in the six biggest categories in near real-time on TikTok and Facebook, and all speeches will quickly be posted on Twitter. In a first, Disney+ will stream the Oscars show live in parts of Europe. The academy has also sought out new marketing partners like Letterboxd, a social media site for movie fans (8.4 million members, most of them ages 18 to 34), in a sad-but-true admission that it must convince people that they should care about the Oscars.
“We didn’t have to before,” Janet Yang, the academy’s president, said in an interview at the organization’s Beverly Hills offices. “We could rest on our laurels and just let it carry itself.”
One might respond with exasperation: You’re only now figuring that out? Perhaps the time to pull out all the stops to keep the Oscars vibrant was five years ago, when the telecast, for the first time, attracted less than 30 million people, a 20% decline from the previous year. Since then, the number of viewers for the Academy Awards has dropped another 37%, according to Nielsen’s data. About 16.6 million people watched “CODA” win the Oscar for best picture at the most recent ceremony, with viewership swelling after Will Smith slapped Chris Rock onstage late in the show.
But Yang can’t be held responsible. She was elected president only in August. The academy also has a new chief executive for the first time in 11 years; Bill Kramer, the former director of the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, was appointed to that role in June. Together, Yang and Kramer have brought a blast of fresh air to the stuffy organization, working to improve transparency, calm a membership revolt over last year’s removal of several categories from the live Oscars telecast and shore up the academy’s wobbly finances.
In the past, Yang said, “a lot of cultural institutions felt like they should be sitting on a hill, a little bit more protected, almost untouchable.” She added that the academy itself felt “ivory tower-ish,” but that it was now “a different time” and “a different culture.”

Everything Everywhere All Up for Auction: [Style Desk]

Full text: Hot dog hands, a raccoon puppet and other oddities from the multiverse fetched thousands of dollars in an online auction of props from "Everything Everywhere All at Once."
The free market has assessed the value of the prosthetic hot dog hands that appeared in "Everything Everywhere All at Once" as $ 55,000 -- or $ 5,500 per sausagey finger.
That price was determined in a weeklong auction that ended Thursday, in which the independent film studio A24 sold 43 lots of props and costumes from the movie. The reality- and genre-bending film, which is nominated for 11 Oscars, stars Michelle Yeoh as Evelyn Wang, a Chinese American immigrant and laundromat owner trying to save a dizzying multiverse from ruin.
Bidders claimed the Elvis costume worn by the stylish villain Jobu Tupaki (Stephanie Hsu) and the lip balm that Evelyn's husband, Waymond (Ke Huy Quan), uses to zip between universes. Bidding peaked at $ 60,000 for an suggestively shaped "auditor of the month" trophy that first appears on the desk of an I.R.S. bureaucrat (Jamie Lee Curtis) but winds up somewhere else altogether. The Wang family's laundry-delivery R.V. sold for $ 11,000 to a buyer who should not expect to drive it anytime soon.
"This needs new transmission, engine, tires and serious T.L.C. on the interior," the lot's description warned. "The R.V. is currently not street legal."
No memento proved more desirable than a raccoon puppet nicknamed Raccacoonie that, at $ 90,000, was the auction's highest-selling item. The puppet figures in a recurring gag about Disney and Pixar's "Ratatouille," one of several eclectic cinematic references dotted throughout by the film's directors, Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan.
Proceeds from the auction, which totaled $ 555,725, will be donated to three organizations: the Asian Mental Health Project, which aims to make mental health care more accessible in Asian American communities; the Transgender Law Center, which champions the rights and safety of transgender and gender-nonconforming people; and the Laundry Workers Center, which works to improve conditions for laundry, warehouse and food service workers. A24 declined to release the names of the winning bidders.
Jason Kisvarday, the film's production designer, said in an interview on Wednesday that he was surprised to see so many of the items going for thousands of dollars. "There's usually not a lot of demand or interest in these types of things after the movie comes out," he said.
The galaxy-brain nature of the film's plot demanded equally absurd props and costumes, which have resonated with fans. The multiverse was made chic by the costume designer Shirley Kurata, while Mr. Kisvarday oversaw the department that bought or created most of the other items for sale in the auction.
Some were easier to procure than others. A pair of gloves for the hot dog hands were cut from a sweater and hot-glued together by Allison Trautman, the art department coordinator. An umbrella covered in doughnuts was secured by Joshua Bramer, the prop master. The hot dog hands themselves, along with Raccacoonie, were created by the special effects and makeup artist Jason Hamer.
Mr. Kisvarday took other projects into his own, non-hot-dog-shaped hands. He visited a stone supplier in Pasadena, Calif., with the film's directors to select about 10 rocks that at one point replace the human characters. They were looking for "neat and interesting" rocks that could be thrown down a hill, he said.
One of them, accessorized with googly eyes that Mr. Kisvarday ordered from Amazon, sold on Thursday for $ 13,200. "It's not because it's a rock," he said, "it's because of how many people saw the rock, are excited about this rock, and it means something to them."
In addition to its charitable goals, the auction also advances A24's efforts to build a recognizable brand with cultural cachet. Since the studio was founded in 2012, it has been responsible not just for hits ("Euphoria," "Lady Bird") but also for a growing offering of beanies and hoodies meant to appeal to the Letterboxd and Criterion Collection crowd. The studio has previously auctioned off items from "Midsommar" and "Uncut Gems," including, yes, an "iced out" Furby pendant.
"Everything Everywhere All at Once" has made more than $ 100 million worldwide since its release in March, making it A24's highest-grossing title.
The auction generated buzz for the film during an awards season in which it has become an unexpected heavyweight. The film picked up honors at the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild Awards, and leads the pack with 11 Oscar nominations, including for best picture, best director, best actress (Ms. Yeoh), best supporting actress (Ms. Hsu and Ms. Curtis) and best supporting actor (Mr. Quan).
Awards season has been "absolutely bonker-pants," Mr. Kisvarday said.
Although Mr. Kisvarday expected many of the items in the auction to be sold to private collectors, he said he hoped that some, like the family R.V., would land somewhere publicly accessible like a museum.
"I think it's fun when mementos like this wind up in places where many people can see and enjoy them," he said.

The Courage to Be ... Dull: [Op-Ed]

Full text: Well, it's certainly hard to avoid seeing Ron DeSantis these days. He's all over the place, promoting his new book.
Have you been paying attention? Here's a pop quiz. DeSantis's tome is called:
A. "The Courage to Be Free"
B. "From the Panhandle to Pensacola"
C. "Available to Speak Is My Middle Name"
Yeah, yeah. "The Courage to Be Free" it is. And let me be honest with you, people. I made it only about halfway through before throwing in the proverbial towel.
That was when DeSantis was bragging about classifying the taping of professional wrestling matches as an "essential" service during Covid lockdown. And if he'd gone on to, say, tell us about meeting Hulk Hogan, we'd have been in totally different territory. But no -- there are virtually no interesting stories or amusing anecdotes in the book. The defining lesson from "The Courage to Be Free" is that Ron DeSantis is really boring.
His speeches don't seem any better. On Wednesday he gave a long address denying that his administration had anything to do with banning books. ("That's really a nasty hoax.") In which he demonstrated that it's possible to be passionate in a really non-engrossing way.
This week's State of the State speech to the Florida Legislature was another snooze. To be fair, these aren't generally addresses you'd ever want to tape for after-dinner entertainment. But if the executive in question has national-level ambitions, his staff will generally toss in at least one quotable moment.
Nah. There was only a little anti-vaxxing. ("No Floridians should have to choose between a job they need and a shot they don't want.") And a lot of introducing guests, notably the happy police officers who went to Florida under a state recruitment bonus program. No mention that said program was paid for with federal funds.
We did see some tender shots of the governor waving to his wife and kids. Casey DeSantis, a former talk show host, is a very important factor in her husband's career. Perhaps you remember the video she sent out during his re-election campaign that began, "And on the eighth day God looked down on his planned paradise and said, 'I need a protector."'
Hard to imagine Melania Trump coming up with something like that. Hey, whatever happened to Melania, anyway? This is an excellent opening for a comparison of the two most talked-about potential Republican presidential candidates.
Wait wait wait wait!!! Why should I worry about comparing DeSantis and Trump when I'm not going to vote for either one of them anyway?
Calm down. It's your job as a concerned citizen to know about this stuff.
Let's take abortion. DeSantis, always an opponent, said he was "proud" to have signed a bill banning abortion at 15 weeks, and he has promised to do the same with a bill now bouncing around the State Legislature that would basically prohibit ending a pregnancy before most women have any idea they're pregnant.
Donald Trump, on the other hand, is a guy who told a national TV audience "I am very pro-choice in every respect" back in 1999, but ran for president in 2016 promising to appoint a Supreme Court that would overturn Roe v. Wade.
The transformation had absolutely nothing to do with ethical evolution. It was all about his discovery, when he started eyeing the Republican nomination, that you could get a ton of applause at conservative events if you mentioned the evils of abortion.
So would you rather see the guy with political principles win? Even if you hate the principles in question? DeSantis has well-worked-out right-wing positions on everything, from vaccines to the teaching of anything about gender identity in public schools. That's the issue that got him into a war with Disney World -- and truly, you have to be pretty darned conservative to be pals with World Wrestling Entertainment but a foe of the Magic Kingdom.
Trump, meanwhile, is intensely opposed to ... taxes. That really does come from deep in his heart. The rest is kind of whatever works.
And he does love connecting with the public -- at least the friendly segment. While DeSantis was out promoting his book, Trump was at the Conservative Political Action Conference making a more, um, vigorous presentation. ("I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution.")
When DeSantis wants to get people excited, he generally falls back on the war against "woke." Last year, after an easy win in the Republican gubernatorial primary, he made a speech in which observers counted five assaults on wokeism in under 20 seconds.
So here are the choices. One is a rather dull potential Republican presidential nominee who wants you to think of him as a very conservative deep thinker.
The other just wants to stay in the headlines. Trump was happy to talk with reporters before his CPAC speech, even when the question was whether he'd keep running if indicted in any of the ongoing criminal investigations into his behavior. (Perhaps it goes without saying, but the answer was yes.)
OK, you wouldn't vote for either of these guys even if the contest was for an Academy Award for best inaccurate documentary. But warm weather's coming -- time to prepare for those spring picnic conversations.

Full text: In a speech before his supporters, the former president charged forward in an uncharted direction, talking openly about leveraging the power of the presidency for political reprisals.
Donald J. Trump has for decades trafficked in the language of vengeance, from his days as a New York developer vowing "an eye for an eye" in the real estate business to ticking through an enemies ledger in 2022 as he sought to oust every last Republican who voted for his impeachment. "Four down and six to go," he cheered in a statement as one went down to defeat.
But even though payback has long been part of his public persona, Mr. Trump's speech on Saturday at the Conservative Political Action Conference was striking for how explicitly he signaled that any return trip to the White House would amount to a term of spite.
"In 2016, I declared, 'I am your voice,"' Mr. Trump told the crowd in National Harbor, Md. "Today, I add: I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution."
He repeated the phrase for emphasis: "I am your retribution."
Framing the 2024 election as a dire moment in an us-versus-them struggle -- "the final battle," as he put it -- Mr. Trump charged forward in an uncharted direction for American politics, talking openly about leveraging the power of the presidency for political reprisals.
His menacing declaration landed differently in the wake of the pro-Trump mob's assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a last-ditch effort to keep him in power. The notion that Mr. Trump's supporters could be spurred to violence is no longer hypothetical, as it was in 2016 when he urged a rally audience to "knock the crap out of" hecklers. The attack on the Capitol underscored that his most fanatical followers took his falsehoods and claims of victimhood seriously -- and were willing to act on them.
While Mr. Trump has long walked up to a transgressive line, he has often managed to avoid unambiguously crossing it, leaving his intentions just uncertain enough to allow his supporters to say he is being mistreated or misinterpreted.
Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, said the speech was "a call to political action to defeat the Democrats who have put their collective boot on the throats of Americans," adding, "Anyone who thinks otherwise is either being disingenuous or is outright lying because they know President Trump continues to be a threat to the political establishment."
But John Bolton, a national security adviser under Mr. Trump who later broke publicly with him, had little doubt what the former president meant on Saturday. "I think he's talking about retribution he would exact on people who would cross him," said Mr. Bolton, who also served as ambassador to the United Nations. The reference was not about Mr. Trump's supporters, Mr. Bolton said, but about Mr. Trump himself.
"It would be, first and foremost, getting back at the people he thinks deserve some kind of punishment for not doing what he tells them to do," Mr. Bolton said. "And it's a big group of people."
After Mr. Bolton's public falling-out with Mr. Trump, the former ambassador wrote a detailed book about his time working for the president, describing his behavior as "obstruction of justice as a way of life" and depicting Mr. Trump as endlessly transactional. When Mr. Trump could not persuade a federal judge to block the book's publication, he threatened Mr. Bolton on Twitter.
Mr. Trump's comments on Saturday were in his prepared remarks, rather than being off the cuff. His aides seemed pleased with the inherently sinister tone. The remarks were quickly packaged and pinned atop his campaign's "War Room" Twitter page, and "I am your retribution," in all capital letters, was turned into the subject line of a fund-raising email.
Mr. Trump's speech was laced with allusions to Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, so far the chief threat to his winning another nomination. He referred, for instance, to "some in our party" who have been open to cutbacks in Social Security. "I wonder who that might be," Mr. Trump mocked.
Casting himself as a "warrior" was another reminder that Mr. Trump is generally determined to let no one -- including a Florida governor fresh off clashes with Disney and the College Board -- evince more strength than the former president in warring with the left and its perceived allies.
Facing investigations in two states and in two cases overseen by the Justice Department, Mr. Trump repeatedly insisted that the judicial system should not be trusted, holding himself and his supporters up as the true arbiters of justice. Mr. Trump said the same day that he would not exit the presidential race if he were indicted.
Mr. Bolton pointed to another part of Mr. Trump's speech: "This is it. Either they win or we win. And if they win, we no longer have a country."
"I think that's also a signal that he's not going to accept a second defeat, the same way he didn't accept the first defeat," Mr. Bolton said of Mr. Trump's election lies. Mr. Bolton suggested Mr. Trump's efforts to stay in power were not a well-oiled plan, but a series of day-to-day impulses he was acting on. But what Mr. Trump is saying now, Mr. Bolton said, is different.
In essence, Mr. Bolton said, the former president is "pretty much calling for something close to civil insurrection."
Mick Mulvaney, who served as Mr. Trump's acting chief of staff, saw the speech in terms of its potential to turn off general-election voters who rejected the former president in 2020.
"It's a great line for his hard-core supporters," said Mr. Mulvaney, who attended a recent donor retreat hosted by Mr. DeSantis. "But he just lost another two points with suburban women in the Midwest."
Planning is already underway for 2025 should Mr. Trump win the White House again. Advisers have discussed reimposing a Trump-era executive order, known as Schedule F, that would give the president vast power to replace what have traditionally been civil service workers embedded across the federal bureaucracy.
Mr. Trump alluded to those efforts on Saturday.
"I will totally obliterate the deep state," he said, "I will fire ..." he went on, before being interrupted by applause and "U.S.A.! U.S.A.!" chants. "I will fire the unelected bureaucrats and shadow forces who have weaponized our justice system like it has never been weaponized before."
Mr. Trump has for decades sought to play the role of victim and vowed vengeance on those who cross him, beginning in 1973 with the first Justice Department investigation into what it said were his family business's racially discriminatory housing practices, a case he eventually settled. He cried foul in August when the F.B.I. searched his private club, Mar-a-Lago, for classified documents that he had not turned over despite a grand jury subpoena. And he has railed against that investigation and the state inquiries in New York and Georgia, denouncing both prosecutors in those states -- who are Black -- as "racist" for looking into him.
Jason Stanley, a Yale professor who wrote the book "How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them," said the danger in undermining trust in the rule of law was that it left little alternative to overthrowing or overturning the system itself.
"This is the final battle," Mr. Trump said on Saturday. "They know it, I know it, you know it, everybody knows it."
Dr. Stanley said that such language was all the more notable given the context of Jan. 6. "He's saying it's a war," he said. "There is not law versus chaos, there is just him versus his enemies, your enemies."
He added bluntly, "Trump engages in fascist rhetoric."
Last month, Hugh Hewitt, the conservative radio host, asked Mr. Trump directly if he would "use the powers of the presidency to punish people who punished you."
"No, I wouldn't do that," Mr. Trump said, before indulging the topic further. "I would be entitled to a revenge tour, if you want to know the truth," he said, "but I wouldn't do that."
Demanding unconditional loyalty -- and promising retaliation if he doesn't get it -- has been so much a fixture of his career that former employees at his company often say the public still doesn't fully understand what he is capable of.
"If given the opportunity, I will get even with some people that were disloyal to me," Mr. Trump told Charlie Rose in a November 1992 interview about those who had crossed him during his recent financial struggles.
One dissident member of a board he dealt with, Mr. Trump said, was finally removed "after being hit over the head with a cannon."
"What was the cannon?" Mr. Rose asked.
"The cannon," Mr. Trump replied, "was me."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On the eve of Hollywood's big, if diminished, night, two deeply researched books dig into the scandal-soaked history of the Academy Awards.
Are the Oscars history?
What else to conclude from the recent publication of two erudite if waggish books about this somewhat deflated annual pageant: Michael Schulman's OSCAR WARS: A History of Hollywood in Gold, Sweat, and Tears (Harper, 589 pp., $ 40) and Bruce Davis's THE ACADEMY AND THE AWARD (Brandeis University, 485 pp., $ 40)? Pile these on the even fatter "Hollywood: The Oral History," by Jeanine Basinger and Sam Wasson (Harper, 748 pages), and you'll have jury-rigged something like a Norton Anthology of American Moviedom.
There have been plenty of Academy annals before, of course: detailed compendiums, official and not; glossy adornments for the coffee table; and at least one prose investigation of its increasingly byzantine fashion system. But these often felt like sideshows, guidebooks: boosterish accessories to a main event that is now struggling to regain and maintain its centrality in international culture.
With fewer than 10 million people in 2021 watching a telecast that once commanded five times that (a few more did tune in last year; viewership spiked after The Slap), and the box office for art films hardly afire, the new books land more like crisis management briefings.
Things in the film industry have been bad before, they remind, and might yet get better again.
There was, for example, 1934. In the middle of the Depression, reports Davis (a former Academy executive director who retired in 2011 and promptly plunged into its archives), the organization was forced to take up a collection from members, as if passing the plate in a church pew, so that the ceremony could go on.
Or 1989, widely and unfairly remembered as the Worst Oscars Ever, which Schulman, a staff writer for The New Yorker, dissects like a forensic pathologist hovering over an overdressed corpse.
The ceremony had become "a big, embarrassing yawn," and Allan Carr, the caftan-wearing producer of "Grease" known as "Glittermeister, " was hired to zhuzh it up, which he did with a caroming live-action Snow White -- uncleared with Disney -- singing "Proud Mary" with her Prince Charming, played by Rob Lowe, then a leader of the Brat Pack. The gaudy opening number, with stars ducking for cover as Snow roamed the aisles, ruined Carr's career and possibly his life. The unfortunate actress, Eileen Bowman, was coerced into signing a nondisclosure agreement that forbade her to talk about the Oscars for 13 years.
"Never trust a man in a caftan," Lowe had, in fairness, warned her.
Davis, whose book is subtitled "The Coming of Age of Oscar and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences," focuses on the organization's formative years, "an early life that deserves a bildungsroman."
But he is less Thomas Mann than diligent mythbuster, calling, for example, Susan Orlean's assertion in her biography of Rin-Tin-Tin that the dog got more votes than any other male actor at the first Awards (repeated in this newspaper) "nonsense of a high order, now inserted into the historical record utterly without evidence." In the ballot box Davis uncovered at the Margaret Herrick Library, there were no votes for the pooch.
Davis also dispels the belief that the statuette was originally nicknamed by Bette Davis -- no relation -- because its backside resembled that of her then-husband Harman Oscar Nelson. He makes the case rather to credit a secretary of Norwegian descent, Eleanore Lilleberg, who was tired of referring to the "gold knights in her care" as "doodads, thingamajigs, hoozits and gadgets" and mentally conjured a military veteran with dignified bearing she'd known as a girl.
This version of events, if true, is apt, for in Schulman's framing, the Oscars have long been no mere contest but brutal hand-to-hand combat. He chronicles the 1951 best actress race between Davis (for "All About Eve") and Gloria Swanson (for "Sunset Boulevard"); they lost to Judy Holliday ("Born Yesterday") but the first two performances both proved more enduring, show business loving no subject better than itself.
He retraces the long exile of the screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, perhaps the most prominent of the Hollywood Ten, blacklisted and driven behind pseudonyms for defying the House Un-American Activities Committee; credited and awarded for "Roman Holiday" only posthumously (his widow's cat, satisfyingly, scratched up the thingamajig's head).
And no book called "Oscar Wars" could neglect how Harvey Weinstein, currently facing life in prison for his sex crimes, made the campaign nuclear in 1999 with "Shakespeare in Love." The reign of this titan (and his eventual topple) was for the nation-state of Hollywood as consequential as Nixon's for the U.S. government.
He "made the Oscars dirty," Schulman writes, using tricks like buying ads suggesting Miramax's "The Piano" had won best picture at the preliminary critics' awards (with "runner-up" in tiny print); relentlessly wooing senior citizens; parties, swag, ballot-commandeering and bad-mouthing his opponents. He even brought Daniel Day-Lewis to Washington to help get the Americans With Disabilities Act passed as a boost for "My Left Foot."
Along with the envelope, some context, please: Scandal has always beset Hollywood. Indeed, both authors note that the Academy was founded to raise the tone after a series of them, most notoriously the arrest of the Paramount actor Fatty Arbuckle after a starlet died in his hotel room following an orgy. Both in their own way document the race and gender inequity endemic to the institution, and its often ham-handed attempts to course-correct.
And both conjure how exciting and special this event used to feel, with all its warts and overlength, like Christmas and New Year's rolled into one.
Now, as Oscar totters toward his 95th birthday, in a ceremony to be aired Sunday, March 12, going to a theater to see something screened feels fun but increasingly antique, like hopping on a wooden roller coaster (when I suggest it as a recreational activity to my teenagers, they look at me like I'm the MGM lion).
It's not just the pictures that have gotten small, as Swanson playing Norma Desmond declared -- they've gotten really small, as we're all Ernst Lubitsches now with cameras and flattering filters in our back pockets. The ceremony to commemorate them has shrunk as well.
"I'm not sure I see a way to re-establish the Academy Awards as an experience for a wide swath of the country's, or the world's, population," Davis writes. "It isn't hard to see the Oscars on a track to becoming something like the National Book Awards" -- heaven forfend! -- "with way more glamorous presenters."

May I Interest You in Something Pricier?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Companies are trying to maintain fat profits as the economy changes, making "premiumization" their new favorite buzzword.
Big companies are prodding their customers toward fancier, and often pricier, versions of everything from Krispy Kreme doughnuts to cans of WD-40.
It's evidence of the corporate world's new favorite buzzword: "premiumization."
Businesses are hoping to keep the good times rolling after several years in which they seized on strong spending by consumers and rapid inflation to raise prices and pump up profit margins. Many firms are embracing offerings that cater to higher-income customers -- people who are willing and able to pay more for products and services.
One sign of the trend: The notion of premiumization was raised in nearly 60 earnings calls and investor meetings over the past three weeks.
It is an indication of a changing economic backdrop. Inflation and consumer spending are expected to moderate this year, which could make it more difficult for firms to sustain large price increases without some justification.
The premiumization trend also reflects a divide in the American economy. The top 40 percent of earners are sitting on more than a trillion dollars in extra savings amassed during the early part of the pandemic. Lower-income households, on the other hand, have been burning through their savings, partly as they contend with the higher costs of the food, rent and other necessities that make up a bigger chunk of their spending.
"The pool of people willing to spend on small to large premium offers remains strong," said David Mayer, a senior partner in the brand strategy practice of Lippincott, a consultancy.
As products grow more expensive and exclusive, big swaths of the economy are at risk of becoming gentrified, raising the possibility that poorer consumers will be increasingly underserved.
Businesses have long segmented customers, trying to push richer ones into pricier and more profitable purchases: Think of the spacious premium seats on a plane versus the cramped economy-class alternatives. But the trend picked up during the pandemic, and the lurch toward luxury is now spanning a wider array of products and services.
Executives at some companies are focusing heavily on the rich. At American Express, which reported record spending by cardholders last quarter, "we're constantly tightening up the card members that we're acquiring," Stephen J. Squeri, the company's chief executive, told analysts on a recent call, describing how the firm has been steadily limiting its focus to higher-earning applicants. "That premium customer base, while not immune to economic downturns, certainly right now is spending on through."
Other companies are emphasizing premium offerings as an alternative to discounts. Krispy Kreme spent last year attracting customers using deals -- including a "Beat the Pump" discount that matched the price of a dozen glazed doughnuts to the national average price of a gallon of gas. But it is planning to do less discounting this year, an executive said on a call, aiming instead to generate "excitement around our premium specialty doughnuts," which include fancier, higher-priced offerings around holidays.
Pushing premium products has come up in some unexpected corners of the corporate world. WD-40, the firm that makes the lubricant of the same name, has found that customers will pay more for products with enhancements, like a can with a "smart straw" to spray the lubricant in two different ways -- in either a precision stream or more of a mist.
"Premiumization creates opportunities for revenue growth, grows margin expansion and, most importantly, it delights our end users," Steve Brass, the company's chief executive, said on a call.
The question now is what the shift toward more premium products means for the broader economy. It could be a sign that companies are making last-ditch efforts to justify higher prices and cling to fat profits as the economic outlook darkens.
To fight inflation, the Federal Reserve has been rapidly raising interest rates, which is meant to slow economic growth and cool consumer demand. That could make it harder for businesses to continue charging more, cooling inflation and potentially cutting into profits in the process.
"Most everybody had pricing power last year," said Scott Chronert, a strategist at Citigroup, explaining that his forecasts suggest "that is going to shift."
And attempts to maintain profit margins by giving products a premium sheen are not guaranteed to pay off.
Six Flags, the theme park operator, recently shifted to a more premium model by raising prices and limiting discounts, which Selim Bassoul, the chief executive, described as "bold changes to our business model in order to elevate the guest experience." It has had mixed results so far. In the nine months through September, attendance at its parks fell by 25 percent from the year before, spending per guest rose 22 percent and, in the end, profits fell by nearly 10 percent.
In January, the Walt Disney Company acknowledged that it might have pushed too hard on prices at its theme parks, angering loyal customers. It revised its policies on ticketing, hotel parking, ride photos and annual passes.
But the shift toward premium products could signal the start of a more lasting change, as businesses settle into a routine of selling lower volumes for higher prices in a divided economy -- a strategy that could leave poorer consumers worse off.
Take the U.S. car market. At the end of 2017, 36 models were priced below $ 25,000, and the share of cars that cost that much or less accounted for nearly 13 percent of all sales of new cars, according to an analysis by Cox Automotive. At the end of last year, only 10 models had starting prices that low, and their share of sales plunged to less than 4 percent. Subprime buyers are increasingly falling out of the market, in a sign that poorer people, who tend to have lower credit scores, are struggling for a foothold.
Carmakers may be cutting cheap models in part because it is hard to justify the cost of making them in an era of expensive parts and persistent labor shortages, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox. But the expectation is that they will continue to focus on bigger-ticket models, while resisting pushing overall vehicle production higher to levels that could lead to discounting even as supply bottlenecks ease.
"They're better off selling fewer and maintaining pricing power," Mr. Smoke said. That could spur competitors to jump into the market to provide cheaper cars, but such an adjustment is unlikely to happen quickly.
For now, car ownership could increasingly become the purview of the rich. Having fewer new cars eventually translates into fewer used cars. That raises prices and, together with higher interest rates, threatens to shut poorer people out of the market.
It's a window on what a widespread emphasis on premiumization could mean for the economy: lower production, potentially higher inflation in the short run and permanently higher prices in the long run.
But it is too early to tell whether what is happening now is widespread and persistent enough to have a meaningful economic impact, said Isabella Weber, an economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who has been studying profits and prices during the pandemic.
"It's a very confusing moment," she said.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Big companies are prodding their customers toward fancier, and often pricier, versions of everything from Krispy Kreme doughnuts to cans of WD-40.
It’s evidence of the corporate world’s new favorite buzzword: “premiumization.”
Businesses are hoping to keep the good times rolling after several years in which they seized on strong spending by consumers and rapid inflation to raise prices and pump up profit margins. Many firms are embracing offerings that cater to higher-income customers — people who are willing and able to pay more for products and services.
One sign of the trend: the notion of premiumization was raised in nearly 60 earnings calls and investor meetings over the past three weeks.
It is an indication of a changing economic backdrop. Inflation and consumer spending are expected to moderate this year, which could make it more difficult for firms to sustain large price increases without some justification.
The premiumization trend also reflects a divide in the U.S. economy. The top 40% of earners are sitting on more than $1 trillion in extra savings amassed during the early part of the pandemic. Lower-income households, on the other hand, have been burning through their savings, partly as they contend with the higher costs of the food, rent and other necessities that make up a bigger chunk of their spending.
“The pool of people willing to spend on small to large premium offers remains strong,” said David Mayer, a senior partner in the brand strategy practice of Lippincott, a consultancy.
As products grow more expensive and exclusive, big swaths of the economy are at risk of becoming gentrified, raising the possibility that poorer consumers will be increasingly underserved.
Businesses have long segmented customers, trying to push richer ones into pricier and more profitable purchases: Think of the spacious premium seats on a plane versus the cramped economy-class alternatives. But the trend picked up during the pandemic, and the lurch toward luxury is now spanning a wider array of products and services.
Executives at some companies are focusing heavily on the rich. At American Express, which reported record spending by cardholders last quarter, “we’re constantly tightening up the cardmembers that we’re acquiring,” CEO Stephen Squeri told analysts on a recent call, describing how the firm has been steadily limiting its focus to higher-earning applicants. “That premium customer base, while not immune to economic downturns, certainly right now is spending on through.”

Preaching Freedom but Gripping the Reins: [Review]

Full text: In his new book, "The Courage to Be Free," the Florida governor and potential Republican presidential candidate offers a template for governing based on an expansive vision of executive power.
THE COURAGE TO BE FREE: Florida's Blueprint for America's Revival, by Ron DeSantis
As governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis has been casting himself as a Trump-like pugilist. But the overall sense you get from reading his new memoir is that of the mechanical try-hard -- someone who has expended a lot of effort studying which way the wind is blowing in the Republican Party and is learning how to comport himself accordingly.
Not that he admits any of this, peppering "The Courage to Be Free" with frequent eruptions about "the legacy media" and "runaway wokeness." But all the culture war Mad Libs can't distract from the dull coldness at this book's core. A former military prosecutor, DeSantis is undeniably diligent and disciplined. "The Courage to Be Free" resounds with evidence of his "hard work" (a favorite mantra), showing him poring over Florida's laws and constitution in order to understand "the various pressure points in the system" and "how to leverage my authority to advance our agenda through that system." Even the title, with its awkward feint at boldness while clinging to the safety of cliché, suggests the anxiety of an ambitious politician who really, really wants to run for president in 2024 and knows he needs the grievance vote, but is also trying his best to tiptoe around the Trump dragon.
What a difference a dozen years make. Back in 2011, a year before DeSantis first ran for Congress, he published "Dreams From Our Founding Fathers" -- an obvious dig at Barack Obama, whom DeSantis lambasted for his "thin résumé" and "egotism" and "immense self-regard." It was a curious book, full of high-toned musings about "the Framers' wisdom" and "the Madisonian-designed political apparatus."
His new book will leave some supporters, who have encouraged DeSantis to "humanize himself" for a national audience, sorely disappointed. In his acknowledgments, he thanks "a hardworking team of literary professionals who were critical to telling the Florida story," but presumably those professionals could only do so much with the material they were given. For the most part, "The Courage to Be Free" is courageously free of anything that resembles charisma, or a discernible sense of humor. While his first book was weird and esoteric enough to have obviously been written by a human, this one reads like a politician's memoir churned out by ChatGPT.
DeSantis's attempts at soaring rhetoric are mostly too leaden to get off the ground. "During times of turmoil," he intones, "people want leaders who are willing to speak the truth, stand for what is right and demonstrate the courage necessary to lead." Of his childhood baseball team making the Little League World Series, he says: "What I came to understand about the experience was less about baseball than it was about life. It was proof that hard work can pay off, and that achieving big goals was possible." You have to imagine that DeSantis, a double-barreled Ivy Leaguer (Yale and Harvard Law School), put a bit more verve into his admissions essays. At around 250 pages, this isn't a particularly long book, but it's padded with such banalities.
Much of it is given over to laying out what he calls "Florida's blueprint for America's revival," or, as he puts it in his generic summary: "Be willing to lead, have the courage of your convictions, deliver for your constituents and reap the political rewards." What this has meant in practice looks an awful lot like thought policing: outlawing classroom discussion of sexual orientation through the third grade; rejecting math textbooks that run afoul of Florida's opaque review process; forbidding teachers and companies to discuss race and gender in a way that might make anyone feel "discomfort, guilt, anguish or any other form of psychological distress." Florida also has a ban on abortion after 15 weeks -- which DeSantis has indicated he would be willing to tighten to six weeks -- with no exceptions for rape and incest.
In this regard, all the bland platitudes do serve a purpose. DeSantis's blunt-force wielding of executive power might sound like a good time for hard-core social conservatives, but if part of the point of this book is to float a trial balloon for a presidential run, you can see the gears turning as he tries to make his message palatable for the national stage. Take out the gauzy abstraction, the heartwarming clichés, and much of what DeSantis is describing in "The Courage to Be Free" is chilling -- unfree and scary.
Of course, DeSantis insists that he's simply doing his bit to fight "political factionalism" and "indoctrination." He removed Tampa's democratically elected prosecutor from office in large part for pledging not to prosecute abortion providers -- explaining in the book that he, DeSantis, was just using the powers vested in him by Florida's state constitution to suspend a "Soros-backed attorney" for "a clear case of incompetence and neglect of duty." (Last month, a federal judge ruled that DeSantis was in violation of state law.) DeSantis boasts about big-footing companies and local municipalities when he prohibited vaccine mandates and lifted lockdowns. In April 2020, when the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship expressed annoyance at the possibility of dealing with some "jackass mayor," DeSantis told him not to worry: "I will overrule any mayor that gives you guys a hard time."
It's unclear what happened to the DeSantis of a decade ago, a boilerplate libertarian and founding member of the House Freedom Caucus who was mainly preoccupied with fiscal austerity and privatizing Medicare and Social Security. His 2011 book contained numerous tributes to "limited government." Now, he says, in his typically windy way, anything he does that looks suspiciously intrusive is in fact a cleansing measure, purging public life of excess politicization: "For years, the default conservative posture has been to limit government and then get out of the way. There is, no doubt, much to recommend to this posture -- when the institutions in society are healthy. But we have seen institution after institution become thoroughly politicized."
Fewer than 20 pages later, DeSantis proposes making about 50,000 federal employees -- currently apolitical civil servants -- into "at-will employees who serve at the pleasure of the president." By any measure, this would amount to politicization on steroids.
But despite all the dutiful servings of red meat, DeSantis looks so far to be the favored son of the donor class -- which is probably the main audience for this book. The message to them seems to be twofold. First, don't normalize "the woke impulse": When Disney's chief executive criticized Florida's so-called Don't Say Gay law (officially titled "Parental Rights in Education"), DeSantis cracked down accordingly. Second, Republican donors can take assurance from "the Sunshine State's favorable economic climate" that, when it comes to what truly matters to them, it will be business as usual.
Reading books, even bad ones, can be a goad to thinking, but what DeSantis seems to be doing in "The Courage to Be Free" is to insist that Americans should just stop worrying and let him do all the thinking for them. Any criticism of his policies gets dismissed as "woke" nonsense cooked up by the "corporate media." (Rupert Murdoch's Fox Corporation and News Corp, which owns the publisher of this book, doubtless don't count.) "I could withstand seven years of indoctrination in the Ivy League," DeSantis says, only half in jest.
The bullying sense of superiority is unmistakable, even when he tries to gussy it up in a mantle of freedom. DeSantis is not taking any chances: He may have been able to "withstand" the "indoctrination" of being exposed to ideas he didn't like, but he doesn't seem to believe the same could be said for anyone else.

DeSantis's 'Apocalyptic' Attack on Higher Education: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In 2017, the government of Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban passed a law intended to drive Central European University, a prestigious school founded by a Hungarian refugee, George Soros, out of the country. At the time, this was shocking; as many as 80,000 protesters rallied in Budapest and intellectuals worldwide rushed to declare their solidarity with the demonstrators. "The fate of the university was a test of whether liberalism had the tactical savvy and emotional fortitude to beat back its new ideological foe," wrote Franklin Foer in The Atlantic.
Liberalism, sadly, did not: The university was forced to move to Vienna, part of Orban's lamentably successful campaign to dismantle Hungary's liberal democracy.
That campaign has included ever-greater ideological control over education, most intensely in grade school, but also in colleges and universities. Following a landslide 2018 re-election victory that Orban saw as a "mandate to build a new era," his government banned public funding for gender studies courses. "The Hungarian government is of the clear view that people are born either men or women," said his chief of staff. In 2021, Orban extended political command over Hungarian universities by putting some schools under the authority of "public trusts" full of regime allies.
Many on the American right admire the way Orban uses the power of the state against cultural liberalism, but few are imitating him as faithfully as the Florida governor and likely Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis. Last week, one of DeSantis's legislative allies filed House Bill 999, which would, as The Tampa Bay Times reported, turn many of DeSantis's "wide-ranging ideas on higher education into law." Even by DeSantis's standards, it is a shocking piece of legislation that takes a sledgehammer to academic freedom. Jeremy Young, senior manager of free expression and education at PEN America, described it as "almost an apocalyptic bill for higher education," one that is "orders of magnitude worse than anything we've seen, either in the recent or the distant past."
Echoing Orban, House Bill 999 bars Florida's public colleges and universities from offering gender studies majors or minors, as well as majors or minors in critical race theory or "intersectionality," or in any subject that "engenders beliefs" in those concepts. The bill prohibits the promotion or support of any campus activities that "espouse diversity, equity and inclusion or critical race theory rhetoric." This goes far beyond simply ending D.E.I. programming, and could make many campus speakers, as well as student organizations like Black student unions, verboten.
There's more. Under House Bill 999, general education core courses couldn't present a view of American history "contrary to the creation of a new nation based on universal principles stated in the Declaration of Independence," creating obvious limits on the teaching of subjects like slavery and the Native American genocide. The bill also says that general education courses shouldn't be based on "unproven, theoretical or exploratory content," without defining what that means. "State officials would have unfettered discretion to determine which views are 'theoretical' and banned from general education courses," says a statement by the libertarian-leaning Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression.
Finally, the bill centralizes political control over hiring by allowing faculty to be cut out of the process. Right now, some boards of trustees have the power to veto hiring recommendations made by faculty and administrators, though Young says they rarely use it. Under House Bill 999, rather than an up-or-down vote on candidates vetted by university bodies, trustees could just hire whomever they want. "They don't even have to hire someone who applied through the regular process," said Young. "They can just say, 'Here's my friend Joe, he's going to be the new history professor."'
This would give DeSantis's cronies enormous power over who can teach in Florida's colleges and universities. Last month, I wrote about the governor's campaign to transform the New College of Florida, a progressive public institution, into a bastion of conservatism. At the time, some faculty members suspected that DeSantis's new trustees might find their grandiose plans stymied by bureaucratic obstacles. Young believes that House Bill 999 would sweep many of those obstacles away.
The bill, of course, is only one part of DeSantis's culture war. His administration has already limited what can be taught to K-12 students about race, sex and gender. (Some teachers removed all books from their classroom shelves while they waited for them to be reviewed for forbidden content.) When Disney spoke out against one of DeSantis's education measures, the governor punished the corporation. And he is pushing legislation taking aim at the news media by making it easier for people -- especially those accused of racial or gender discrimination -- to sue for defamation.
Last year, a court blocked parts of DeSantis's "Stop W.O.K.E" act, a ban on critical race theory that a federal judge called "positively dystopian." In the likely event that House Bill 999 passes, the courts may block it as well. But the governor, a front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, has made his political program very clear.
"DeSantis seems to be putting into practice some of the political lessons Orban has to teach the American Right," Rod Dreher, an American conservative living in Budapest, recently wrote with admiration. If you want to see where this leads, Hungary has a lot to teach us.

It was the 36th day of what was supposed to be a 30-day shoot in New Orleans, but the cast and crew of the rock drama "Daisy Jones & the Six" were still at it.
They were filming a scene, set in 1977, in which the actors Riley Keough and Sam Claflin, as the lead singers of the band Daisy Jones & the Six, unwind backstage after performing on "Saturday Night Live" for the first time. Half-empty liquor bottles, wood paneling, smoke-machine haze and framed photos of the Coneheads and Gilda Radner surround them.
Claflin, who plays Billy Dunne, asks Keough, in the title role of Daisy Jones: "How'd it feel?"
"It felt good, yeah," she says, "I mean, not as good as cocaine."
Before New Orleans, the cast and crew had filmed for 69 days in the Los Angeles area, and afterward some of them headed to Athens and the Greek island of Hydra for a key episode. Production on "Daisy Jones & the Six" was initially scheduled to begin in April 2020, and even after it was postponed because of Covid for about 18 months, it had to be suspended a few more times. Despite daily testing protocols and mask mandates, the reality of filming concerts with hundreds of extras, hookup scenes and booze-and-Quaalude-fueled bacchanals had taken a toll.
"Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll is hard to do in a pandemic," said Lauren Neustadter, who with Reese Witherspoon executive-produced the series.
"Daisy Jones & the Six" tells the story of a band's rise to sold-out-stadium-level fame thanks to a hit album, "Aurora." The musicians make and promote "Aurora" as Daisy, Billy and his wife, Camila Dunne (Camila Morrone), try to navigate the sharp edges of a love triangle.
It's based on a 2019 novel of the same name by Taylor Jenkins Reid that has sold more than 1 million e-book and print copies, according to NPD BookScan, and has been translated into more than 30 languages. Part of its appeal is the storytelling approach: Reid creates an oral history that reads like nonfiction, populating it with musicians and record producers who reminisce against the backdrop of beater vans, tour buses and Sunset Strip stages.
To answer many Google searches: The Six is not a real band, though it's inspired by Fleetwood Mac and others. Still, that uncertainty -- as well as the will-they-or-won't-they tension between Keough's and Claflin's characters -- is something Witherspoon's production company, Hello Sunshine, and Amazon Studios hope will grip viewers when "Daisy Jones & the Six" begins streaming its 10 episodes on Amazon Prime Video, starting March 3.
For Hello Sunshine, "Daisy Jones" could affirm its book-to-screen dominance after its successes with the film "Where the Crawdads Sing" and the Netflix series "From Scratch." For Reid, whose books have become coveted source material in Hollywood, this will be the first adaptation to reach audiences, so its popularity is likely to influence the market for her material. For the up-and-coming actors in the cast, many of whom sidelined other projects to stick with "Daisy Jones" amid its realigned shooting schedule, it's a chance to break out.
The built-in fan base that the book provides will be a boon for the series but also brings its own anxieties. "There is for me a desire to make the fans happy and bring to life this book that has lived in their hearts and in all of our hearts for so long," Morrone said. "I don't think I've ever done a project that has this many eyes on it."
It is one of the first projects that the head of Amazon Studios, Jennifer Salke, ordered after Jeff Bezos hired her in 2018. "You have to make noise," she said, discussing her early days at the company and her reaction to the "Daisy Jones" pitch. "You have to be able to do something that is different. It can't feel like a show that you could just get everywhere."
"Daisy Jones" promised to deliver that, she said, and Amazon stood by the production as it waited out the restrictions of the pandemic.
Covid delays provided a significant benefit: more than a year for the actors to take music lessons. Before then, the most noteworthy musical credential any of them had was that Keough is Elvis Presley's granddaughter.
'I need you to bring your iPad to the beach tomorrow'
If streaming-television economics are under pressure, as layoffs at Disney, Netflix and other companies indicate, you would not know it from Amazon's investment in "Daisy Jones & the Six."
The 1970s-era sets are designed to shag-carpeted verisimilitude. For a week, the production took over the Sunset Strip in Hollywood, using vintage pornography as a visual reference when they transformed the Viper Room into the seedy Filthy McNasty's. The principal characters alone required 1,500 wardrobe changes in the first half of production. With other characters and extras, the production sometimes needed 250 outfits a night.
About 25 original songs have been written by Blake Mills, who wrote some in collaboration with others, including Phoebe Bridgers, Marcus Mumford and Chris Weisman. Eleven of those songs make up "Aurora," which Atlantic Records will release when the series begins streaming. The first track, "Regret Me," dropped earlier this month and by mid-February had garnered about 2 million streams on Spotify.
Even the show's P.R. efforts hark back to the era of big-studio budgets: More than 30 publicists were involved (or hoped to be involved) in the reporting, photographing and fact-checking of this article. The photo shoot drew multiple entourages.
But the TV version of "Daisy Jones" started small, with a wife and husband in Los Angeles.
The husband is Scott Neustadter, a screenwriter whose credits include the 2009 movie "500 Days of Summer," which he wrote with Michael H. Weber.
One day in 2017, Neustadter's representatives got a call from Brad Mendelsohn, Reid's manager, asking if the screenwriter might want to take a look at a manuscript about a fictional 1970s rock band whose trajectory and interpersonal drama resembled Fleetwood Mac's. Neustadter, a fan of that era's music, started reading it that morning.
He got in touch later that day with his wife, Lauren Neustadter, who had just been hired by Witherspoon to lead Hello Sunshine's film and TV division. He reminded her that he and Witherspoon had once talked about being captivated by Stevie Nicks. "I knew this was a passion of Reese's," he said.
Lauren spent a few hours reading Reid's manuscript. Then she interrupted her boss's vacation. "I need you to bring your iPad to the beach tomorrow morning," she remembered emailing Witherspoon, "because this book is so good, and it's going to be so competitive."
The next morning, she said, Witherspoon replied: "I'm obsessed."
'I have prepared my whole life to write this'
Days later, the Neustadters hatched a plan.
Lauren took Reid to breakfast at Hugo's, in the San Fernando Valley. As she was praising the book, her phone rang.
"I think this is for you," Neustadter said, handing it to Reid, who by then had achieved modest success as an author. She maintained her chill, at least on the outside, as she listened to Witherspoon tell her how much she loved her book.
That afternoon, Scott took Reid to lunch at a coffee shop on Larchmont Avenue. "I told her I have prepared my whole life to write this," meaning a film or TV version of "Daisy Jones," he said.
Reid decided she wanted Hello Sunshine to spearhead the screen version, with Scott and his writing partner Weber attached as creators. She ultimately sold the "Daisy Jones" manuscript to Penguin Random House.
In May 2018, Lauren Neustadter and Witherspoon met Salke for lunch at Tavern, a restaurant in Brentwood. Salke, a former NBC executive, told them she was looking for big, ambitious projects that could benefit from the breadth of Amazon, including its ability to market and sell books, audiobooks, music and merchandise.
"They teased me with something, but they wouldn't tell me what it was," Salke said. "They were like, 'We might have something right up your alley."'
On a Friday in July, Neustadter sent her the "Daisy Jones" manuscript, a series overview and a script for the pilot episode, written by her husband and Weber, and said Salke had the weekend to consider it before Hello Sunshine would shop the series to others. Salke ordered it to series on Monday. "We just were really invested from the get-go," she said.
The following March, the novel came out and was named the pick for Witherspoon's book club. It sailed onto the New York Times best-seller list, as did one of Reid's earlier books, "The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo." That novel's paperback version has now spent more than 100 weeks on the list, and Netflix said last year that it is planning a screen adaptation.
'I was put on this earth to be Daisy'
A few months later, the producers began to think about casting. Lauren Neustadter received a call from Alexandra Trustman, one of Hello Sunshine's agents at C.A.A., who suggested one of her other clients, Riley Keough, for the role of Daisy.
Keough had recently finished filming Janicza Bravo's film "Zola," in which she played a stripper, when she met in May 2019 with the Neustadters, along with Will Graham, who shared the job of being the showrunner of "Daisy Jones" with Scott Neustadter; and Mendelsohn, an executive producer of the series.
"I was put on this earth to be Daisy," Keough told them.
Keough declined an interview request in the weeks after the death of her mother, Lisa Marie Presley, but in an email, she said that it was the character's combination of strength and vulnerability that moved her. "Daisy is complicated," she wrote. "I didn't identify with Daisy's desire to sing and write songs, because that's something I had never done. What I connected with was Daisy's artistry and how she felt, not being taken seriously as a young woman."
She was one of several actors playing musicians who first came to the roles without much musical training. Suki Waterhouse, a novice pianist when she was cast, plays the keyboardist Karen Sirko. Will Harrison, who was in a band in college, plays the lead guitarist Graham Dunne. Sebastian Chacon, who had drummed a bit, plays the drummer Warren Rojas (in the book, his last name is Rhodes). Josh Whitehouse, who actually knows how to play guitar, was cast as Eddie Roundtree, the bassist.
Claflin, as Billy Dunne, was the final band member cast. He had never played guitar. As part of an audition, he began to sing Elton John's "Your Song," before the musical supervisor urged him to stop. When Tony Berg -- the veteran producer who has worked with artists including Bob Dylan, Aimee Mann and Phoebe Bridgers, and who is the show's music consultant -- asked Claflin to sing a Beatles song, the actor couldn't think of one.
"Out of everyone involved in this project, my knowledge of '70s music, '70s L.A., '70s anything -- especially in America and especially in the music sphere -- was very, very, very lackluster," Claflin said in an interview.
The producers were determined to make it work. "We were going to lean on movie magic," Lauren Neustadter said.
After the pandemic upended the 2020 production schedule, the actors threw themselves into music. "I was incredibly into the idea of having three hours of piano lessons every single day," Waterhouse said. "This is something that nobody gets a chance to do."
'They sounded like a real band'
The work of transforming actors pretending to be in a band into a band became the professional preoccupation of the music supervisor Frankie Pine. She oversaw a monthslong "band camp" consisting of one-on-one instruction and group rehearsal, in addition to taking and reviewing video footage of practice sessions so they could listen to their pitch and timing and watch their comportment.
"I wanted to really try to create a sense that this is a real band," Pine said. "When you're a real band, you hang out together, you eat together, you drink together, you bitch to each other. You go through the normal motions of a group of people that are constantly together. So I was really trying to create this camaraderie that a true rock 'n' roll band has."
As the production prepared to start shooting in Los Angeles in September 2021, Lauren Neustadter felt it was important for the band to put on a live concert, performing songs from the show. They rented a Hollywood studio with a stage and, still limited by Covid, invited about 40 people who were working on the series.
In attendance was Tom Wright, a veteran actor ("Tales From the Hood," "Sunshine State") who plays Teddy Price, the Berry Gordy-Quincy Jones-esque record producer. He was prepared to be underwhelmed.
As a young actor, Wright lived in New York in the 1970s and had a roommate in the music business. "I got to know and hang out with people like Ornette Coleman and Chet Baker and Jim Hall -- you know, some great jazz musicians. And I got to see them perform live, so I kind of have a high bar," he said.
At the friends-and-family concert, "I was shocked," Wright said. "They sounded like a real band. It was incredible."
If this was the band's smallest-scale concert, the largest was in New Orleans, where the production design team refitted the 26,500-seat Tad Gormley Stadium to appear, on camera at least, as if it were Soldier Field in Chicago, where the story's biggest concert occurs.
This was the accomplishment of the show's production designer Jessica Kender, who said that because the look of the 1970s is so recognizable, details mattered. A scene at a gas station, for example, required them to remove ethanol warnings on the pumps that wouldn't have been there decades ago.
When Nzingha Stewart, who directed four episodes, envisioned a montage in which Billy and Daisy visited dozens of radio stations, the production design crew built one radio broadcasting booth that Kender remade over and over again with decals and details summoning Tulsa, Dallas and Fort Worth. In a concert scene, merch stands are piled with band T-shirts, like one with a sepia photo of Keough that reads, "Daisy Jones and the Six: Amsterdam, the Netherlands 5 Jun 1976."
Denise Wingate, the costume designer, once traveled with the 1980s band the Bangles. When she read "Daisy Jones," she said, "I was like, 'I have to do it."' During the pandemic delay, she spent hours every day searching eBay and vintage sites. Once lockdowns eased, she said, "I went to flea markets every weekend for a year."
And she fielded requests. When Keough asked for "Stevie Nicks vibes" for the Soldier Field performance, Wingate found a Halston caftan in gold lamé that she cut up the front to turn it into a cape and paired with a vintage metallic crochet dress. ("Daisy's wardrobe was a true highlight of my life," Keough wrote.)
To find inspiration for the "Aurora" album cover, Wingate made a mood board featuring Nicks in a billowing white dress. In the cover that resulted, Billy is in a denim shirt and Daisy wears a dress similar to the one Nicks wore, which Wingate had made. Just as it is described in the book, the rock stars are staring into each other's eyes, but a space exists between them.
For Reid, who imagined this story and took it from her head to paper starting in 2016, it's hard to believe it's all happening. "If your book is like your baby," she said, "then the adaptation is like my grandchild. I don't really get to take credit, but boy am I so proud of them."
She is thrilled by the show, she said. "When I think of Daisy now, I see Riley's face. When I think of Billy, I think of Sam."

'SOS' Is in Rarefied Air With 9th Week at No. 1: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: "SOS" is now the longest-running No. 1 album by a woman since Adele's "25" seven years ago.
SZA, SZA, SZA, SZA, SZA, SZA, SZA, SZA, SZA.
For a ninth time, "SOS," the latest release by the R&B singer-songwriter SZA, is No. 1 on Billboard's album chart, making it the longest-running chart-topper by a woman in seven years -- since Adele's "25" notched 10 weeks at the top in late 2015 and early 2016.
In its 10th week out, "SOS" had the equivalent of 93,000 sales in the United States, a figure that includes its 127 million clicks on streaming services, according to the tracking service Luminate. Released in early December, "SOS" has dipped from No. 1 only once, when the K-pop group Tomorrow X Together took the top spot with a blitz of sales of collectible CDs.
Since "25," a handful of other albums have had runs at No. 1 of at least nine weeks, but none were by female artists: the "Encanto" soundtrack (nine); Morgan Wallen's "Dangerous: The Double Album" (10); and Drake's "Views" and Bad Bunny's "Un Verano Sin Ti" (13 apiece).
And in the time since "25," the recorded music industry has been through a complete format transformation. When Adele released her album, she declined to make the entire thing available for streaming, and it racked up CD sales figures that seem unthinkable now -- five million units sold in its first six weeks alone. ("25" was not available on streaming outlets for its first seven months.) By contrast, virtually all of the consumption of "SOS" has come via streaming; last week, only about 500 copies of the album were sold as a complete package.
Also this week, Rihanna's latest album, "Anti" (2016), rose 42 spots to No. 8 after her performance in the Super Bowl halftime show.
The pop-punk-etc. band Paramore opened at No. 2 with its sixth studio album, "This Is Why," which had the equivalent of 64,000 sales. Taylor Swift's "Midnights" is No. 3.
Wallen's "Dangerous" is No. 4 -- its 110th week on the chart and 107th in the Top 10. In the 67-year history of Billboard's album chart, only two titles have had longer stays in the Top 10: the "My Fair Lady" Broadway cast recording, released in 1956 (173 weeks), and the soundtrack to "The Sound of Music," from 1965 (109 weeks). In recent weeks, Wallen's album has passed the "West Side Story" soundtrack (106) and the cast recording of "The Sound of Music" (105).
Bad Bunny's "Un Verano Sin Ti" is No. 5 in its 41st week on the chart.

In a Dream Garden, Guidance on Love: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Kate Soper's "The Romance of the Rose," which had its long-delayed premiere at Long Beach Opera, showcases her signature quick-shifting eclecticism.
SAN PEDRO, Calif. -- "What is art?" the composer Kate Soper asked at the beginning of "Ipsa Dixit," her last big stage work, from 2016.
In her tender, whip-smart new opera, "The Romance of the Rose," which premiered this weekend at Long Beach Opera, she quotes a chunk of Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" that poses another query: "What is love?"
No one has ever accused Soper of shying away from the big questions. And her works go about answering them studiously but sensuously -- with earnestness, wit, whimsy, self-awareness and music that ranges freely among, for a start, Baroque madrigals, power ballads and barbed modernism.
In "Ipsa Dixit," she answers the question "What is art?" with, more or less, the piece's title: It is whatever I say it is. In "The Romance of the Rose," the answer to "What is love?" is something like: It's a lot of conflicting things, in a scary, delicate balance. It's every thing.
Over a decade in the making and based on the medieval epic of the same name -- nearly 22,000 lines of octosyllabic Old French couplets -- "The Romance of the Rose" adapts some of the poem's strands while adding inventions of Soper's own. (She usually writes her librettos, often with interpolations from other authors, ancient to modern.) In an allegorical garden, the Dreamer guides the Lover as she pines for a rose: "What a perfect symbol for a dream of love!"
Aroused and confused, the Lover is set upon by the God of Love, Lady Reason and Shame -- and all have advice that's at once persuasive and suspect, compelling and incomplete, about how the Lover should feel, about what love means.
As the loose, stylized, funny, often poignant plot progresses, these allegorical characters seem to lose their moorings; in Soper's world, even stock figures can't be trusted to maintain their points of view. (This isn't, or isn't just, the old battle between head and heart.) The fatal seductiveness of narcissism; ambivalence about performing; the nature of reality -- it's all, ambitiously, here.
I should insert what has become a standard caveat about this composer: Describing "The Romance of the Rose" might make it sound dry and bookish, but it isn't. Soper's text is so sly and eloquent -- "Since the truth's thus riddled with such tears, the essential question's not 'What is the truth?' but 'Who cares?"' -- and her music so eclectic and quick-shifting that her work keeps you engaged even when you're a bit baffled. Like her other stage pieces, "Rose" is high culture and low, talky but agile, brainy but -- and! -- feeling.
Few composers are as interested in, or as gifted at, exploring the transitions and the middle ground between speaking and singing, which gives Soper's works a familial relationship to book-based musical theater. There's something of "Hadestown" in this new piece's opera-pop-Broadway amalgam and mythological milieu, even though Soper's vision is less folksy and more crystalline -- more like Sondheim in its precision and cleverness, its laughing-crying lucidity about life's complications, if not in its sound.
Her vision of musicals extends from sumptuous golden-age lyricism through "Phantom of the Opera"-style rock belting to contemporary confessional intimacy, though she's also unafraid of astringency, complexity and moments of plain noise. There is also the lovely, pared-down tunefulness that gives away Soper's early-career roots as an aspiring singer-songwriter: She writes in an online essay about "The Romance of the Rose" that the germ of an aching torch-song duet for Idleness and Pleasure (two minor characters who nod toward a Greek chorus), a highlight of the score, dates back to those days.
Like a true singer-songwriter, Soper trusts economy of musical expression. Christopher Rountree, Long Beach Opera's music director, conducts an ensemble of nine, but often the instrumental textures are sparer than even those modest forces. In one memorable passage at the end of the first act, the Dreamer's elegy is accompanied by the slow calligraphy of a solo viola.
It's Long Beach Opera's luck to have ended up with the piece after its premiere -- planned for April 2020 at Montclair State University's Peak Performances series -- was canceled by the pandemic.
Long Beach, which in 2019 premiered Anthony Davis's "The Central Park Five" before it went on to win a Pulitzer Prize, has had some internal rockiness in the past year over its commitment to inclusion efforts but also a new artistic director, James Darrah, who has staged "The Romance of the Rose" at the Warner Grand Theater here.
Darrah's production is a mixture of scrappiness and chic, and emphasizes the otherworldliness of Soper's conception. Prairie T. Trivuth's set, lit starkly by Pablo Santiago, depicts the garden as a pristine white courtyard dotted with potted plants and, eventually, dripping with blood. Molly Irelan's costumes, with period cuts, vivid fabrics and sparkling touches, further the opera's mood of pert pastiche. Its Baroque references connect medieval France to the glittery splendor of 17th-century allegorical court masques.
In keeping with Soper's stylistic variety, the cast comes from a range of musical backgrounds but shares a commitment to making the bountiful, erudite text legible. (The supertitles, for once, aren't really necessary.) As the Dreamer, Lucas Steele has a sweet voice and Disney-prince ingenuousness with a self-referential wink. Radiating a charming mixture of naïveté and intelligence, Tivoli Treloar has a light mezzo-soprano flexible enough to convey all the Lover's changes of perspective.
As the God of Love, Phillip Bullock travels from airy falsetto to basso profundo depths. Anna Schubert is a fiercely articulate Lady Reason, Laurel Irene a punkish Shame. Tiffany Townsend and Bernardo Bermudez bring rich-toned gusto to Idleness and Pleasure, here a couple of louche lounge lizards.
"The Romance of the Rose" isn't perfect. The piece experiments with giving each of the three main allegorical foils a distinctive live-electronic vocal processing identity -- Lady Reason, angular vocoding; the God of Love, echoey reverb; Shame, angry distortion. But even if it had been more perfectly executed, this conceit feels like a complication too many in an already complicated piece.
Soper's previous major stage works, "Here Be Sirens" (2014) and "Ipsa Dixit," were substantial single acts. Conceiving "The Romance of the Rose" in two acts was Soper setting a new challenge for herself, not just in length but also in structure. What, in theater, should prompt an intermission, and what brings the audience back for more? What hunger in the first act does a second act satisfy; what crisis is resolved?
These are questions that "The Romance of the Rose" doesn't entirely solve. The second act feels like more of the same, with a somewhat blurrier version of the characters having the same debates they had before the break. (The production could be clearer in the final half, too.)
Discussing the piece later with the friend I brought to the performance, I thought that Shame, which we learn at the beginning is our "urge for self-annihilation" -- "an emissary from the gut to foil both the head and the heart" -- might have been more effectively introduced as a crisis at the end of the first act. The war that ensues between her and the rest of the dramatis personae might then have given the second act higher and sharper stakes.
Shame's role in the first act as an equal point in the allegorical triangle surrounding the Lover might be true to the original poem. But in the opera this figure feels like the odd one out, rather than the singular nihilistic force opposing everyone else onstage.
It's a criticism, sure. But the fact that my friend and I spent hours going over what we enjoyed and what we might tweak about "The Romance of the Rose" gives you a sense of the piece and its marvels, its ability to stick in the mind and soul. After all, a lesson of the opera is that, for better or worse, we can't help wanting to perfect the things we love.

Full text: What you should do while you are still employed, how to retain important data and what you should be doing with your money.
Tech booms and busts are nothing new, so the recent layoffs at places like Facebook and Google may not be that surprising. The media industry is its own perpetual roller-coaster ride, so forced departures from NBC News and Gannett are understandable.
But when companies like 3M, Disney and FedEx push employees out the door, as they have in recent weeks, it makes sense for most people to sit up and stare squarely at the situation. With tens of thousands of employees from scores of employers having lost their jobs since the beginning of the year, it's well worth asking two questions.
Am I next? And if I might be, what should I do to prepare?
There is, in fact, a lot you can do, according to experts from fields as diverse as personal technology, career management, finance and employment law. And all of their advice can help you tighten up your life even if your job does not end up being on the line.
Do a career checkup while you are still employed.
First, keep a close eye on your employer's health. If your workplace holds regular staff meetings, ask about whether it is meeting its financial goals. If you work for a company that trades its shares publicly, this information will be readily accessible.
"Before you freak out and wonder if you're next, get a sense of how well your business is doing," said Scott Dobroski, a career expert at Indeed, the job search site. "If the business is staying flat or going down, you might want to start preparing."
Mr. Dobroski recommends annual career checkups, just like an annual physical exam with a doctor. Assess your résumé and make sure it reflects new skills you've acquired and projects you've tackled. You can also draft a generic cover letter.
It's easy to network with people you know, but push yourself to network outside your usual social and professional circle, too. You never know who will reach out with an opportunity -- what social scientists call "the strength of weak ties."
Introduce yourself to people who work at companies or in industries you're interested in, and keep in touch with them intermittently, through platforms like LinkedIn. Mr. Dobroski also advised being mindful when speaking with competitors.
"It's always a good rule of thumb to act with transparency and take actions you'd feel comfortable with your boss, or colleagues, knowing," he said.
J.T. O'Donnell, a career coach, noted that you can set up your LinkedIn profile to ensure recruiters are able to get in touch with opportunities. That means turning on the feature in privacy settings that indicates you're open to being contacted, updating your headline on LinkedIn with top skills, updating your work history to quantify accomplishments in various positions (with data when possible) and posting your perspective on industry news so LinkedIn followers get a sense of your voice.
Developing personal relationships with colleagues in a remote-work environment requires more effort, especially when you've never met in person. If you've collaborated with someone consistently, and you trust the person, ask for his or her personal email address and phone number. That way, if layoffs arrive abruptly or unexpectedly, you can reach out, whether you need a reference or just want to talk.
Many companies offer professional development budgets. Take advantage of those to build skills that will make it easier to land your next role. According to Handshake, a job search platform for students and early-career workers, notable skills that employers are searching for include Microsoft Excel, Python, Java, Adobe Illustrator, Canva, machine learning and Adobe InDesign. There has also been a nearly 17-times increase in Handshake job openings mentioning TikTok since 2019.
Save emails that you've received praising your work and testifying to your abilities. When applying for jobs in the future, you might want to reread those as a reminder of some of the strongest work you've done, or even to quote from. Those notes will also be useful as a reminder that losing a job often has nothing to do with your skills and abilities.
Separate your personal and work data, and make a plan to retain important information.
The shift to remote work during the pandemic forced many workers to blend together their professional and personal lives. This inevitably led workers to use their work devices at home for personal tasks.
Though convenient and cost effective, using an office computer for personal use poses serious risks to your private data in the event of a layoff, said Brian Fitzpatrick, the founder of Google's Data Liberation Front, a team that developed products for people to manage their Google data.
Anything that you do on company equipment can be monitored and obtained by your employer. If you became involved in a legal issue, all of your data -- including photos, browser history and personal messages -- could become exposed in the discovery process.
That's why Mr. Fitzpatrick responds from his personal address when friends and family send emails to his professional email accounts.
"You should absolutely never put any of your personal data in your work account," he said. "You don't own that data if it goes to your company account."
The simplest way to divorce personal data from work machines is to use only devices you own for personal matters. Buying your own computer is one solution -- and there are plenty of options for less than $ 200, like Chromebooks or refurbished machines.
Realistically, however, when workers are in the office they will deal with some personal matters on their devices, Mr. Fitzpatrick said. Do what you can to keep that activity off the work machine.
For instance, if you take your own smartphone to the office, use it to message your friends and check your social media accounts. If you must use your office machine for personal matters, create a separate profile in a web browser. In the Chrome web browser, for example, click on the profile icon in the upper-right corner and choose "Add" to create a separate profile for personal use. When done, toggle back to your work profile.
Workers should download copies of all their data that they would legally be allowed to take with them. Many employers forbid sales workers to take copies of their contacts, because client lists are deemed confidential -- so check the legality of what you can take before downloading copies.
If you've determined there is personal data on your work devices, download a copy and store it elsewhere, like a personal cloud service such as a Dropbox account or a USB thumb drive.
Here are some examples of how to download copies of your data:
If your office uses Google services, you can visit google.com/takeout. From there, you can follow Google's steps to grab copies of your contacts list, files stored in Google Drive, chat histories and photos. (If your office has disabled Takeout, it's on you to manually dig through your machine and Google account for personal data, drag and copy that data to your own cloud drive or storage device and purge it from the machine.)
If your company uses Microsoft tools, Microsoft lists some simple steps to download copies of your Outlook contacts list and calendar; it also has steps on how to download copies of documents created with Microsoft Word and presentations made with PowerPoint.
Many offices also use password managers that store all of a user's passwords in a digital vault. Most vaults are likely to contain passwords for personal accounts, so it's important to have a copy of your vault to continue to have access to those accounts. LastPass and 1Password, two popular password managers, list steps on their websites for how to download a copy of your vault.
Make your money moves.
Standard personal finance rules apply when considering the possibility of a layoff.
If you have cash in an emergency savings account, it will supplement any severance pay and unemployment insurance you receive. If you don't, now is a fine time to start putting money away, given that many banks are offering savings account interest rates of 3 percent or more.
If you can't put much in savings, going into debt could be necessary if you stop getting a paycheck. The best time to apply for loans, however, is now -- when you do have regular income to report on any application. If you're a homeowner, consider opening a home equity line of credit. If you aren't, a new low-interest credit card might be in order.
Many people borrow from their workplace 401(k) and similar plans. If that's you, keep in mind that leaving or losing your job can trigger the need for more immediate repayment.
Fidelity and Vanguard, which are big administrators of such plans, note that upon the termination of your job, you may have as little as 30 days to repay the debt -- and usually no longer than 90 or so. If you don't pay in time, the balance could become a distribution that could come with a tax bill and a possible 10 percent penalty.
Some employers offer more generous terms, so check your plan's details if you've taken out this type of loan. Better yet, chip away at the debt while you can, if you can, before any potential layoff.
If your employer offers pretax health care flexible spending accounts or dependent care accounts, this might be a good time to seek any reimbursements throughout the year as you incur eligible expenses. That way, you are not scrambling to file one giant pile of claims in the midst of the chaos of a job loss.
But if you don't do this ahead of time, you should still have at least a bit of time after termination to put in for reimbursement before you would forfeit the money in the accounts. Employers allow an average of 90 days to file those claims -- sometimes from the date of your departure and sometimes from the end of the plan's year, according to HealthEquity, a company that administers these plans. Some employers are more strict, however, so ask about this before you make any assumptions.
Employees who get some compensation via stock or options will want to plan as well. Start by checking the vesting schedule for anything you're eligible for, and then see what you can learn about the so-called post-termination exercise period.
You usually have 95 days or less after losing your job to exercise stock options, according to Carta, a company that helps employers and employees manage such compensation, though some companies are more generous.
One task worth doing now: See if your bank account information with a service like Carta is updated so you can quickly transfer money to buy stock options if you want to after losing your job.
Understand your legal options.
If you believe that your employer might sweep you into a layoff for reasons that are illegal, you'll want to retain evidence that could support any legal claim.
Employment lawyers offer several suggestions, and the first one is just basic career hygiene. "Ask for feedback, or demand it, on your performance so you have a record of it," said Lisa J. Banks, a partner in Washington with the firm Katz Banks Kumin.
Employers are often bad at keeping piecemeal records of high performance, but you can be good at it. According to Ms. Banks, emails like "Hey, Bob, thanks, we really rely on you" could be useful later. It is fine to forward these messages to a personal email address, as long as they don't contain any confidential or proprietary information that you were not supposed to have in the first place.
If bad things are happening to you, you'll want to document those as well. It may make sense to consult with a lawyer to make sure you don't break any laws while gathering evidence. Legal counsel might also help you weigh whether to register a formal complaint with your employer while you still have a job (which may subject you to retaliation) or do nothing for now (which, if you threaten legal action after a layoff, may lead the employer to argue that you would have filed a formal complaint sooner if the problem had been real).
At the very least, it makes sense to document any sketchy workplace doings for yourself as they happen, said Jennifer Liu, the managing partner at the law firm of Liu Peterson-Fisher in Burlingame, Calif.
"They can't say that you're making things up now if you have a time-stamped chronology of the last 10 years on the job," she said. "Use your personal email, and email yourself."
Ms. Liu also suggested talking to trustworthy people about what is happening as it happens. Think, too, about who might be willing to speak on your behalf someday if a post-layoff dispute arises.
"When one person says something, it's not as credible as three people saying it," she said.
Plan for the moment.
Layoffs may come without notice, and you may suddenly find yourself on Zoom or in a room with someone who is as uncomfortable as you are. Let that person marinate in those feelings a bit, wallow in any silence and possibly fill it to avoid discomfort.
"When presented with the pink slip, the best thing to do is to listen to what they're saying," said Wendi S. Lazar, a partner in New York City with the law firm Outten & Golden. "People often say, 'I don't remember what they said to me.' Ask for a pencil and paper."
Then ask why you were let go. "They may say: 'Oh, well, we had a mass layoff. There were no performance issues involved at all,"' Ms. Lazar said. "And let's say you end up with a discrimination case and opposing counsel says that you were fired for performance reasons. That's in direct conflict."
Whatever someone says to or about you, try to sit on your hands and hold your tongue. "Don't agree to anything, sign anything or engage in a debate over the merits of the termination right then and there," Ms. Banks said. "There is a possibility that what you say might be construed as some kind of admission of wrongdoing."
And, once more with feeling, transcribe as much of the conversation as you can. "Documentation is all important," she said. "In good times and bad."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The actor and author has a tableware collection for Williams-Sonoma, out just in time for Valentine's Day. For an enthusiastic host, it wasn't much of a stretch.
The scene was set for a party at the Upper East Side apartment that Marlo Thomas shares with her husband, Phil Donahue. Easy-listening instrumental music filled the air; easy-sniffing Jo Malone candles perfumed it.
It was midmorning, but the table was already dressed for dinner. It was mid-January, but the theme was Valentine's Day. The 10 place settings were anchored by red-and-white plates and red-and-white napkins, part of the tabletop collection that Ms. Thomas, 85, the actor, author, activist and philanthropist, has designed in partnership with Williams-Sonoma.
Vivid pink and crimson roses filled an oak-and-stainless-steel wine cooler in the center of the table (part of the Marlo Thomas collection). White hydrangeas were massed in a blue-and-white botanical-print porcelain Champagne bucket (also part of the Marlo Thomas collection) on the sideboard. Pink lilies bent from a blue-and-white hexagonal ceramic jar on an accent table.
"I'm pretty much a flower lady. I'm from California, and I was raised with flowers all year long," said Ms. Thomas, who became a household name in the late 1960s as the preternaturally charming, crackly voiced star of the sitcom "That Girl." "To me, every container is a place to put them."
Every surface, too. The Lalique vase on the sofa table held ivory roses; there were more pink lilies on the coffee table and the console. Peace lilies, Peruvian lilies, boxwood, a fan palm and an arboricola -- all in blue-and-white ceramic planters and ginger jars -- dotted the floor. A dozen floral-print pillows lined the white sectional sofa.
Marlo Thomas, 85
Occupation: Actor, author, activist and philanthropist
New York, New York: "I love it here. I love that we live near seven restaurants. Phil and I are not planners. We don't have a reservation; if there's a table, we go in. And we don't need a car. Can you imagine trying to get a cab in L.A.? You'd be waiting for the rest of your life."
"I told a decorator to send me a whole bunch of chintz pillows and I'd pick some," Ms. Thomas said. "I put them on the floor, and I thought they looked so pretty I said, 'Let's do them all."'
She added: "If you put two different fabrics together, they look clash-y. But if you do 30, they all go together!"
Ms. Thomas became smitten with Mr. Donahue (and vice versa) in 1977, when she was a guest on his talk show, then based in Chicago. (Watch the video on YouTube; their connection was immediate and evident.)
"When we were walking from the green room into the studio, Phil said to me, 'I'd like to ask you about your mother during the interview. Is that OK?"' Ms. Thomas recalled.
"And I thought to myself, 'This is an interesting guy,' because everybody always wanted to know about my father," she continued, referring to the actor and comedian and TV producer Danny Thomas, who founded and was a major benefactor of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, in Memphis. Ms. Thomas is now its national outreach director.
"No one had ever asked about my mother," she said. "I was so touched." (Here's a bit of what Mr. Donahue and his viewers learned: Before marrying Mr. Thomas and having three children -- Marlo is the eldest -- the former Rose Marie Cassaniti was a singer and the host of a radio show in Detroit.)
Ms. Thomas and Mr. Donahue, a divorcé with five children, had a long-distance courtship; she was based in Los Angeles, he in Winnetka, Ill. Not long before they married in 1980, "Phil told me, 'I can't live in L.A. I don't want to spend the rest of my life interviewing John Wayne. I can live in New York or Washington,"' Ms. Thomas said. "And I told him, 'Well, I can live in New York or L.A.' So New York it was."
For the sake of Mr. Donahue, who had never before lived in an apartment, it needed to be New York with a terrace. For the sake of Ms. Thomas, a human heliotrope, it needed to be New York with abundant sun. Think Malibu overlooking Central Park. The penthouse duplex that ticked all the boxes has been home since 1987.
The couple's architect, Charles Gwathmey, convinced them to knock down many a wall to take full advantage the apartment's three exposures: north, south and west. The light from the floor-to-ceiling windows -- they were a headache to install, Ms. Thomas said, but eminently worth it -- brightens the flowing space that comprises the dining room, the living room and the library/TV room.
That girl was very clear with that architect. "I told Charles, 'I don't want a house with Louis anybody -- no Louis XIV, no Louis XV. I just want comfortable furniture,"' Ms. Thomas said, urging a visitor to try out a high-backed, pale-blue leather chair, one of a pair.
She has two of the same style in gray. "When they arrived, Phil called me and said, 'The chairs came, but there's been a mistake. They're not all the same. There are two blue and two gray,"' Ms. Thomas recalled. "And I said, 'Yes, that's the point. Otherwise, the room would look like an airport lounge."'
She chose her wicker dining chairs in part because they had arms, to give friends something to lean on during marathon talkfests around the table. She had the legs of an old pine dining table shortened because it was the only way she could find a coffee table with sufficient surface space for the multitude of hors d'oeuvres that are standard at her parties. A bonus: the table has pullout extensions for guests to easily reach and rest their drinks.
Mr. Gwathmey proposed. Ms. Marlo disposed. He pressed for a marble floor in the entryway. She went with slate. He lobbied for teak floors. She chose pine. "Charles thought pine was too soft, and he was right," Ms. Thomas said. "There are a lot of high-heel marks on it now, but so what? It's a floor. I wanted to use materials that made this feel like a home that had been here for a while."
By design, it is a home whose public spaces don't double as shrines to the self. "We don't put anything professional in our living area," Ms. Thomas said. "You go to some people's houses, and they have magazine covers in the living room."
Still, there are some impressive sights here, if you know where to look.
On a wall beyond the library is a photo of Ms. Thomas receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Barack Obama in 2014. "You dream about winning an Oscar, winning an Emmy," she said. "You don't dream about getting the medal of freedom. I didn't realize how much it meant to me until I was there."
Ms. Thomas's office, a cheerful clutter, contains her four Emmy Awards; a watercolor of her holding the sun, painted by Elaine May; photos of Ms. Thomas flanked by Bill Clinton and Al Gore; photos of her with first ladies Betty Ford, Barbara Bush, Rosalynn Carter, Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama (soon to come: Ms. Thomas with Jill Biden); photos of her with her father; and a picture of Ms. Thomas and Mr. Donahue at Disney World, on their first date.
"Aren't we cute?" Ms. Thomas wanted to know.
They are cute. And now they are also facilitators-in-chief of the podcast "Double Date," an exploration of enduring marriage and its challenges, based on their best-selling 2020 book, "What Makes a Marriage Last." A new batch of episodes is planned for the spring.
Ms. Thomas's interests and commitments often feed into each other. A few years ago, Laura J. Alber, the chief executive of Williams-Sonoma, was among the guests at an annual dinner Ms. Thomas gives for St. Jude's corporate sponsors. Ms. Alber admired the wood-and-silver serving pieces and the square plates arrayed on the coffee table, the fruits of trips to Italy, France and Japan and forays to the Portobello Road Market in the 1960s, when Ms. Thomas was starring in the London production of "Barefoot in the Park."
"Laura said, 'This is the most beautiful stuff I've ever seen. You have to do a collection for us,"' Ms. Thomas recalled.
It wasn't much of a stretch. You'll search long and hard to find a more enthusiastic host. The shelves of Ms. Thomas' china closet fairly groan with glassware and tableware. The large silver punch bowl that once belonged to her mother gets a frequent workout as a mini-seafood bar.
"I'm a person who loves to entertain," she said, pressing mini-sandwiches and cupcakes on some visitors. (For the record, resistance is futile, and the egg salad is great.) "And I really think it through. There's champagne right away, and I always put place cards on the table, so you don't have to walk in and think, 'Would it be bad if I sat next to the host?"'
"And," she added, "there's something nice about the idea that somebody has planned a seat for you."

Podcasts' Rise Hits Turbulence: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: "The dumb money era is over" as layoffs, budget cuts and scuttled deals challenge a long-booming industry.
When the celebrity-backed media company Religion of Sports -- founded by Tom Brady, Michael Strahan and Gotham Chopra -- debuted in 2018, getting into the rapidly expanding podcast business seemed like a no-brainer.
After producing a handful of film documentaries, it launched its first podcast, "Now for Tomorrow With Deepak Chopra," hosted by Gotham's father, in 2020. It hired more than a dozen audio producers and developed a broad slate of shows ranging from talk programs to scripted drama. (Six have been released, including "In the Moment With David Greene" and "False Idol.")
But after a faltering advertising market and fears of a looming recession began battering the media and technology sectors in 2022, executives at Religion of Sports made an about-face. Early last month, the company's podcast employees were informed that they had been laid off and that the audio division would shutter, according to two employees familiar with the decision who were granted anonymity because they feared violating a severance agreement. Ameeth Sankaran, its chief executive, didn't respond to multiple requests for comment.
The demise of Religion of Sports's audio ambitions is the latest sign of frost settling over the once sizzling podcast industry. Spotify has spent more than $ 1 billion in recent years acquiring production companies and signing exclusive deals with celebrities like Joe Rogan and Kim Kardashian. But in January it reduced podcast staff for the third time in five months, and the company's chief content officer, Dawn Ostroff, resigned.
"The dumb money era is over," said Eric Nuzum, a podcast strategist and co-founder of the independent studio Magnificent Noise. "People had been throwing money at things just to see if they could get in and scale up audience quickly, but now everyone's being a little bit more conservative."
Two other prominent podcast publishers, Vox Media and Pushkin Industries, also announced layoffs last month. And Amazon, SiriusXM, NPR and Spotify have all curbed podcast budgets in the last year, sometimes allowing expensive deals to sunset or canceling others before they closed.
Although many companies continue to invest in podcasts, and overall downloads continue to rise, interviews with a dozen current and former podcast producers and executives indicated increased reluctance among publishers to fund projects with no obvious path to short-term profitability. Short-run or seasonal narrative podcasts, which have a limited window to build audiences and attract advertisers, are under especially sharp scrutiny.
"The name of the game has been to 'do less with less,"' said a producer at NPR, who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly. NPR announced a hiring freeze last November, and its summer intern and fellowship programs have been paused indefinitely.
Strong growth in podcast listening and aggressive maneuvering from deep-pocketed companies helped drive the original gold rush. Since 2014, the year "Serial" debuted, the percentage of Americans 12 and over who have listened to a podcast has jumped to 62 percent from 30 percent, for a total of 177 million, according to a report released last year by the analytics firm Edison Research. In 2018, Spotify began acquiring the exclusive rights to podcasts to attract new users and diversify its business. Amazon followed suit, stocking up on original and exclusive podcasts for its services Audible and Amazon Music.
Payouts for content publishers soared. Spotify paid $ 230 million for Gimlet Media in 2019 and around $ 200 million more for The Ringer, Bill Simmons's sports media company, in 2020. Later that year, as consumers spent even more time listening to podcasts during the pandemic, Amazon bought the popular podcast studio Wondery for $ 300 million, while SiriusXM paid $ 325 million for the platform and publisher Stitcher.
Individual podcasts with popular hosts fetched similarly lofty sums. Spotify spent more than $ 200 million for "The Joe Rogan Experience" in 2020 and $ 60 million for Alex Cooper's "Call Her Daddy" in June 2021. That same month, Amazon paid up to $ 80 million for "Smartless," hosted by the actors Will Arnett, Jason Bateman and Sean Hayes, according to Bloomberg.
In addition to traditional advertising, the platforms hoped to recoup their investments through strategies including premium subscription offerings and intellectual property deals with Hollywood. But audiences have been slow to sign up for paid subscriptions to content they're accustomed to getting for free, and film and television development -- a notoriously inexact science -- hasn't proved to be a reliable moneymaker.
Last year, as macroeconomic factors cooled ad spending, darkening forecasts at both new content businesses, like Facebook, and traditional ones, like Warner Bros. Discovery, formerly rosy-eyed podcast executives began hitting the brakes.
"The first thing marketers do when they anticipate a downturn is cut their budgets," said Brad Adgate, an independent media consultant. "If advertising is your primary source of revenue, you're looking at the next quarter's earnings report and trying to figure out how to hit your numbers."
In April, Spotify declined to renew its licensing deal with the Obamas' Higher Ground Productions -- maker of "The Michelle Obama Podcast" and "Renegades: Born in the USA," with Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen -- and it later canceled 11 other original shows. (Higher Ground announced a new deal with Amazon last June.)
One high-profile casualty was a podcast by the "Dawson's Creek" star James Van Der Beek. In July 2022, SiriusXM's Stitcher canceled plans for a retrospective show that was to be hosted and produced by the actor, who promptly sued the company for breach of contract.
A spokesman for SiriusXM declined to comment. But the company's publicly available response to the suit argues that "no written agreement was ever executed by the parties, and no binding agreement was consummated."
According to a person familiar with Stitcher's side of the talks, who discussed confidential negotiations on the condition of anonymity, the publisher got cold feet about the program, for which it would have paid Van Der Beek a minimum of $ 700,000 and 50 percent of net ad revenue, after several of its podcasts missed income projections.
"We were seeing shows that might have had a sell-through rate of 70 percent coming in at more like 50 percent," the person said, referring to the percentage of available inventory the company sells to advertisers.
Stitcher executives were additionally concerned by challenges specific to the Van Der Beek podcast. The actor had preemptively ruled out advertisements for certain mattress companies and other popular product categories and expressed a desire to structure the show around the broader themes of "Dawson's Creek," a format that the publisher viewed as less commercial than a traditional episode-by-episode recap formula.
In an interview, Van Der Beek confirmed the brand exclusions and his intention to create a "nontypical podcast" that would "contribute something new to the space." But he said ad executives at Stitcher had agreed to his vision.
"After 30 years in this business, I know that you don't get to do the creative if you don't make money," he said. "I enjoy working with brands and I love adding value."
Some podcast analysts argued that cutbacks are part of the natural cycle of a new medium's evolution.
"Less direct investment in content isn't necessarily a sign of trouble," said Lauren Jarvis, the former head of content partnerships at Spotify, who oversaw the Joe Rogan acquisition and other deals before she left the company in 2021. "It could mean that the industry has hit a growth stride and can adjust to a more sustainable investment model."
Nuzum, of Magnificent Noise, found cause for optimism in the fact that overall demand for podcasts is up. A recent report from the analytics firm Triton Digital found that podcast downloads in the U.S. rose 20 percent last year over the year before.
"If the audience is there, that's the real sign of health," Nuzum said. "The business will figure itself out."

Filings Outline Emails Of Banker With Epstein
The former top JPMorgan Chase executive responsible for the bank's 15-year relationship with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein swapped sexually suggestive emails about young women with him -- even after Mr. Epstein had been convicted of sex crimes in 2008, according to a filing in a lawsuit against JPMorgan in federal court.
The document bolstered claims in the original complaint, filed in late December, that James E. Staley, who was the lead private banker of JPMorgan, and Mr. Epstein were unusually close and that the bank should have been aware of the relationship. The two men exchanged more than 1,000 emails, according to the filing.
Mr. Staley, who goes by Jes, later became the chief executive of the British bank Barclays. But in 2021, the bank pushed him out in the swirl of a regulatory inquiry into his years-earlier relationship with Mr. Epstein and whether he had fully disclosed the extent of those ties before joining Barclays.
Lawyers for the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands said in the amended civil complaint that Mr. Epstein had emailed Mr. Staley "photos of young women in seductive poses," and that the two had engaged in "discussions of sex with young women." The complaint is against JPMorgan, and Mr. Staley is not a defendant.
The lawsuit said, "JPMorgan had a more than close-up view of Epstein's sex-trafficking" of young women because of Mr. Staley's relationship to Mr. Epstein.
The original complaint was heavily redacted, with much of the more salacious allegations involving Mr. Staley hidden from view.

Seacrest Is Leaving 'Live' After 6 Years
Ryan Seacrest, right, announced on Thursday that he was leaving "Live With Kelly and Ryan," the syndicated morning talk show mainstay that he has hosted with Kelly Ripa since 2017.
Ms. Ripa said on the show that a familiar face, and frequent guest host -- her husband, Mark Consuelos -- would assume co-hosting duties. The show will now be known as "Live With Kelly and Mark."
Mr. Seacrest, a Hollywood multitasker, arrived at "Live" after a one-year search, and provided a steady hand at a somewhat tumultuous time for the show. In 2016, when Mr. Seacrest's predecessor, Michael Strahan, announced that he was leaving the show for "Good Morning America," Ms. Ripa felt blindsided and that the Walt Disney Company -- which syndicates the show -- was favoring its morning show franchise over her longtime talk show, which she has co-hosted since 2001. She walked off the show, setting off a tabloid feeding frenzy.
"Live," which started in the 1980s as a New York talk show co-hosted by Regis Philbin and Kathie Lee Gifford, has long centered on a simple concept: two hosts chatting about their lives, and bringing in celebrities for breezy interviews.
"The hosts have changed, but the overall concept continues on: two people, a man and a woman, and enjoying the chemistry between them," said Michael Gelman, the longtime executive producer, in a 2017 interview.
"Live" has been the top-rated daytime talk show among women ages 25 to 54, a demographic important to advertisers, for more than a year. JOHN KOBLIN

Full text: The latest installment in the Marvel franchise never takes flight despite its hard-working cast, led by Paul Rudd and a new villain played by Jonathan Majors.
Busy, noisy and thoroughly uninspired, "Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantumania" is the latest, though doubtless not the last, installment in a Marvel franchise that took unsteady flight in 2015. Simply titled "Ant-Man," that first movie was two hours of nonsense and branding, and disappointing enough to suggest that the character would be more farm-team material than A-lister. Given Marvel's own superpowers, though, the movie turned out to be a hit, ensuring that the buggy guy would dart around for a while. Three years later, the agreeably buoyant sequel "Ant-Man and the Wasp" followed, and was an even greater success.
"Quantumania" will most likely vacuum up yet more cash, partly because there's not much else shiny and new in theaters now, never mind that this movie isn't especially new or shiny. A hash of recycled ideas and schtick, it borrows from Frank Herbert's "Dune," the "Star Wars" cycle and Marvel's own annals and largely serves as a launching pad for a new villain, Kang (Jonathan Majors). Once again, after some perfunctory table-setting, Ant-Man a.k.a. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and his brainiac romantic partner, Hope Van Dyne a.k.a. the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), suit up, flying high and zipping low to save their family and the world amid quips, the usual obstacles and household drama. (Kathryn Newton plays the Ant kid.)
Directed by Peyton Reed from Jeff Loveness's barely-there script (the first movies each had multiple writers), "Quantumania" bops along innocuously at first, buoyed by the charm and professionalism of its performers and by your narrative expectations. Something is going to happen. After some jokey blather and reintroductions (hello again, Michael Douglas), it does, and once again Ant-Man et al. are sucked into the so-called Quantum Realm, a woo-woo alternative universe filled with swirls of color and looming threats. It's there that Hope's mother, Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), as you're laboriously reminded, spent many enigmatic years and where, after the some narrative delay, the mysteries of that adventure are revealed.
The Realm features darkly ominous hues, fractal shapes, biomorphic organisms, streams of fire and strange beings, including Bill Murray, as a lord, who briefly drifts in on the vapors of his celebrity and flirts with Pfeiffer before drifting out to cash his paycheck. Murray notwithstanding, there are enough attractions to keep your eyes engaged, and the creature design is fairly witty. It isn't pretty; the palette runs toward dun and dull red with slashes of marine blue. But it is diverting to see how movies realize alternative realities, and at least some of the C.G.I. wizards here -- who do yeoman's work in movies like "Quantumania" -- seem to have spent time studying the deep-space images captured by the Hubble Telescope.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
As is too often the case in the franchise realm, far less attention has been paid to the story. None of what transpires is surprising, which puts the burden on the actors. Rudd is fine. A professional cutie-pie, he is a reliably anodyne presence, a human warm blanket. Good-looking but not dangerously so, he has easy charm and a signature crinkly smile that telegraphs that he isn't worried, so you shouldn't be, either. Mostly, he excels at playing a durable Hollywood type -- the ordinary guy who proves extraordinary -- a character that flatters half the audience and will never go out of style as long as men run Hollywood.
Pfeiffer, Majors and Douglas (as Hope's equally big-brained dad) are the truer stars of this show, and each brings something valuable to the mix. (Lilly's character now feels like an afterthought.) For the most part, Majors strikes important poses while glowering imperiously. But he brings some complicated, wounded intensity to his role, and while his sotto-voce delivery sometimes edges into near-parodic Shakespearean overstatement, he effortlessly holds your attention, as do the sublimely chill Douglas and Pfeiffer. Douglas has even less to work with than Pfeiffer, who turns out to be the movie's M.V.P., but they're both wonderful to watch even when doing nothing much at all, which of course is its own kind of superpower.

Broadway Landlords To Merge Operations: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A major British theater company, Ambassador Theater Group, says it is "combining operations" with Jujamcyn, the smallest of Broadway's three big landlords.
Jujamcyn Theaters, the smallest of the three big Broadway landlords, is combining its operations with a large British company, the Ambassador Theater Group, or A.T.G.
The transaction, confirmed Tuesday by Jujamcyn and International Entertainment Holdings Limited, which is A.T.G.'s parent company, would give A.T.G., which already operates two of the 41 Broadway houses, a more sizable foothold in the heart of America's theater industry, and would give Jordan Roth, the Jujamcyn president, more resources for showcasing his creative ambitions. Jujamcyn operates five Broadway houses; A.T.G. has 58 venues in Britain, Germany, and the United States.
The companies said that the transaction is subject to regulatory approval, but did not say by what entity and in which country. No financial terms were specified.
Roth, one of the most colorful characters on Broadway's business side, will become the creative director of the combined company and its largest individual shareholder, with a seat on the board. There are also significant institutional shareholders: A large Rhode Island-based private equity firm, Providence Equity Partners, has for the last decade been A.T.G.'s majority shareholder, and at the height of the pandemic, when theaters were being financially squeezed by a lengthy shutdown, an Australian company, T.E.G., acquired a minority share of the company.
Roth, the 47-year-old son of the real estate titan Steven Roth and the Broadway producer Daryl Roth, has been a singular force in a staid industry, with a disruptive emphasis on customer service in his theaters, a fondness for couture, an exuberant presence on social media, and left-leaning politics sharply at odds with those of his Trump-supporting father.
The transaction portends a potential shift from the quirky to the corporate: A.T.G. is a large company, run by a former wine industry executive, Mark Cornell, who will remain as chief executive of the combined company. A.T.G. is fundamentally British, which could be a cause for concern on Broadway, where there is occasional worry about too many London shows -- often developed with British government support -- swamping work by American theater artists. (After Second Stage Theater, a nonprofit that focuses on work by living American writers, finally acquired a Broadway house in 2015, its artistic director, Carole Rothman, proudly proclaimed that her organization's Broadway programming would feature "No Brits.")
The companies, which would not make anyone available for comment, did not describe the transaction as either an acquisition or a merger, and it is not immediately clear what "combining operations" will mean for the employees or operations at the five Jujamcyn houses or the two A.T.G. Broadway houses.
The Jujamcyn theaters include the Eugene O'Neill, which is the long-term home of "The Book of Mormon," as well as the Al Hirschfeld ("Moulin Rouge!"), the Walter Kerr ("Hadestown"), the August Wilson ("Funny Girl") and the St. James (awaiting a new musical called "New York, New York"). Roth is expected to continue to decide what shows run in those five theaters, and he has previously shown a strong interest in work by American writers: Four of the five current Jujamcyn musicals have American origins; "Moulin Rouge!" has Australian roots, but the stage musical was developed in the United States.
A.T.G. has an ambitious Broadway track record thus far. The company has for a decade operated one of the biggest Broadway houses, the Lyric, which, lavishly reconfigured for 1,622 seats, has for the last five years been home to "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child." A.T.G. has since 2017 also operated one of Broadway's smaller houses, the Hudson, which with just under 1,000 seats often presents plays; the latest, a revival of "A Doll's House" starring Jessica Chastain, began previews Monday night. Among the hallmarks of the company's Broadway presence: fancier food and drink than at most of the American-operated houses.
Notably, both "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child" and "A Doll's House" are produced by companies financed by A.T.G. A lead producer of "Cursed Child" is Sonia Friedman, a prolific and powerful London-based producer whose production company is an A.T.G. affiliate; the director of "A Doll's House" is Jamie Lloyd, a British director whose production company is also affiliated with the group. (Friedman is also a lead producer of "Funny Girl" and "New York, New York," both running at Jujamcyn theaters.)
The combination of A.T.G. and Jujamcyn -- it is not clear what the amalgamated venture will be called -- will still be the smallest of the three big Broadway landlords, but now with seven of the 41 theaters. The Shubert Organization has 17 theaters and the Nederlander Organization has nine. Six theaters are operated by nonprofits, one by Disney, and one (Circle in the Square) is independently owned.
Jujamcyn, founded in the late 1950s, was named for Judy, James and Cynthia Binger, the grandchildren of the company's founder. The Binger family sold the company to Rocco Landesman in 2005; Jordan Roth bought a stake in the company in 2009.
Roth has been an activist theater owner. In the buildings, he has overseen everything from a redesign of the ice cubes (to reduce the clinking noise) to bringing in a new ticket seller, SeatGeek, to manage ticket sales.
He has presented multiple hit shows, among the biggest of which has been "The Book of Mormon," which has been running since 2011. He also landed "Springsteen on Broadway," an enormously successful Bruce Springsteen concert show that had runs both before and after the pandemic shutdown.
Roth has also been active as a producer, most recently transferring a concert-style production of "Into the Woods" from City Center to the St. James; he was also a producer of the Tony-winning 2018 revival of "Angels in America."
A.T.G. has been expanding its presence in the United States, where it now owns, operates or manages 16 theaters, including not only the two Broadway houses, but also the King's Theater in Brooklyn, the Colonial Theater in Boston, and theaters in Detroit, New Orleans, San Antonio, San Francisco and Sugar Land, Texas.

Full text: The members of the Ryuyukai have done nearly 100 years of hard time. Now they're just looking to stay out of trouble.
To hear more audio stories from publications like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android .
On paper, the Ryuyukai were the most fearsome team in Japanese softball. A sort of mutual aid society for retired gangsters, the club had racked up nearly a century of hard time. The manager had been a top mob consigliere; the relief pitcher, who took the field in hot pink shoes, had once been sent to kill him.
But on a cloudless day last March, these hardened ex-cons met their match: the Parent-Teacher Association of Nakanodai Elementary School. The P.T.A. showed no mercy, hitting pitch after pitch out of the scruffy park in suburban Tokyo. Midway through the game, the scorekeeper stopped counting.
Losing is nothing new for Japan's iconic gangsters, the yakuza. For over a decade, they have been suffering one defeat after another.
As late as the 1990s, yakuza numbered around 100,000. Their businesses -- scams, gambling and prostitution rackets -- were illegal, but the groups themselves were not. Fan magazines chronicled their exploits, sandwiching interviews with top bosses between organizational charts and brothel reviews. The groups had business cards and listed addresses. They gave Halloween candy to children and distributed relief supplies after disasters.
But today's yakuza are a shell of what they once were. The same demographic forces wearing down other Japanese industries have also hit organized crime. An aging population has made it hard to find young recruits -- more Japanese gangsters are in their 70s than in their 20s -- and has diminished the once-thriving demand for the yakuza's services.
Society, too, has become less tolerant of them. The authorities have carried out a relentless legal assault on the criminal underworld. Crime is both less profitable and riskier: In 2021, a court sentenced the head of the most violent syndicate to death, a first that sent shock waves through the mob's executive class.
All of that has made crime a less attractive career option. Over the last decade, the yakuza's rolls have plummeted by nearly two-thirds, to 24,000.
Many have struggled to reintegrate. Tattoos, missing fingers and long criminal records limit job opportunities and make it difficult to fit in. Japanese laws discouraging business with the yakuza effectively stop them from taking care of necessities like opening a bank account, getting a phone plan or renting an apartment until they can prove they've been out of the yakuza for five years.
Yuji Ryuzaki, the softball team's manager, established the Ryuyukai in 2012 to help his former colleagues build a new life.
Mr. Ryuzaki had quit the yakuza in the early 2000s. During his 72 years, he has been a member of a nationally ranked high school baseball team, a Buddhist priest, a model and an actor. He had sold jewels, imported luxury goods from Hong Kong and worked as a beautician. And he had -- of course -- been a top executive in a Tokyo affiliate of the Yamaguchi-gumi, Japan's largest mob organization.
The Yamaguchi-gumi is based in Mr. Ryuzaki's hometown, Kobe, a port city in western Japan, where his father ran a temple. He'd known gangsters as long as he could remember: He'd seen yakuza tattoos on his friends' parents and on people in local bathhouses.
In college, a low-ranking tough had beaten up one of Mr. Ryuzaki's friends. In retaliation, Mr. Ryuzaki kidnapped the man and buried him up to his neck in dirt. Mr. Ryuzaki got a beating in return, he said, but the gangsters were impressed by his mettle and signed him up.
Over the decades, he largely stayed behind the scenes. He didn't look like a stereotypical yakuza. He was afraid of needles, so he had never been tattooed. He had managed to keep all of his fingers. His first conviction was for getting mixed up in an argument at Tokyo Disneyland, he said. Not very yakuza.
The idea for the softball team sprang from a chance encounter with Katsuei Hirasawa, a member of Parliament from a working-class Tokyo neighborhood where yakuza were once a part of the social fabric. Mr. Hirasawa had long known Mr. Ryuzaki by reputation, he said during a recent interview, adding that the ex-yakuza had "contributed to a lot of social causes" locally.
The anti-yakuza laws of recent years were well intentioned but "discriminatory," Mr. Hirasawa said, arguing that they pushed people toward recidivism. Softball could help prevent that, he said, by keeping idle hands busy while building discipline and a sense of community.
Ryuyukai membership offered more tangible benefits, too. Mr. Ryuzaki and an associate, Takeshi Takemoto, worked to put the team's members up in housing and connect them with the kind of tough, temporary employment -- construction, road work, sewer maintenance -- that pays a living wage and doesn't ask too many questions.
For years, their efforts drew little notice. Then photos of the team showed up in a couple of weekly tabloids. Journalists started getting in touch. There was even talk of turning their story into a movie.
Mr. Ryuzaki was clearly enjoying the spotlight. He wanted to show the world that gangsters were people, too, he said. And he didn't hate the free publicity.
"We're not hurting anyone, so why not?"
'Pulled Back In'
The season got off to a slow start. One team was a no-show. Another delivered a clobbering that rivaled the P.T.A.'s. The Ryuyukai didn't seem to mind: They showed up early each time to practice their fielding and smoke.
While some teams played with near military precision, the Ryuyukai were clearly there to have fun. When a player fumbled an easy ground ball or stopped running halfway to second base, Mr. Ryuzaki jokingly cursed him out in a salty yakuza patois.
In the club's early days, some teams were intimidated by the former gangsters, Mr. Ryuzaki said. Umpires hesitated to call strikes and outs against them.
They worked on blending in. Mr. Ryuzaki traded the club's black uniforms for gray and electric pink, hoping to project a friendlier image. The league's director praised the team for helping to clean up the field after games. One year, they even won a league championship, cementing their position as part of the scene.
"In sports there are rules," the captain of another team said after a close loss. "As long as everyone follows them, it's not a problem."
Not every player on the Ryuyukai was a yakuza. There were a few broad-shouldered ringers in their 20s; a college friend of one of Mr. Ryuzaki's employees, who cowered when he made an error; and a group of older men who owed unspecified "favors" to Mr. Ryuzaki and Mr. Takemoto.
For those who had been gangsters, though, the team's rules were clear: New members must prove they have quit the yakuza.
The process of leaving can be difficult; traditionally, it cost a finger joint. Nowadays, members can buy their freedom or sometimes just request early retirement for something as prosaic as a bad back. The announcement is faxed to gang offices around the country. Some of the Ryuyukai's members carry a photo of the document on their phones, as proof of their excommunication.
But over the course of the season, it became clear that the team's story -- and the line between in and out of the mob -- was not so straightforward.
Joining the yakuza wasn't like getting a normal job, Mr. Takemoto said after one game. He himself had studied to be a schoolteacher and been a car salesman before he started dealing drugs for a gang in the northern city of Sapporo in his 30s. His ex-wife had even worked for the police.
"Being a salesman was tough," he said. Being a yakuza, on the other hand, was electrifying: "No one is apathetic about joining."
Mr. Takemoto loved the lifestyle. Money. Danger. Fast cars. It was hard to leave that behind. For him, quitting took over two decades in prison and a prosecutor's warning that he was about to spend the rest of his life there.
Masahiko Tsugane, who heads reintegration efforts at the Tokyo branch of the National Center for Removal of Criminal Organizations, noted the increasingly blurred boundaries between yakuza and civilians as gangs work around the new laws.
He's skeptical of mutual aid efforts by former gangsters. People who really want out need to make a clean break, he said: "Otherwise, they'll just get pulled back in."
The center has a program to help ex-yakuza find work. In Tokyo last year, no one applied.
"I've only got eight fingers. Who's going to hire me?" Mr. Takemoto said during an interview in his spacious walk-up apartment, which is owned by his girlfriend. Ex-colleagues in dark glasses and black suits glowered from a photo in a Disney frame.
Mr. Ryuzaki believes it's unrealistic to expect people to completely sever ties to their old lives. Socially, it would be difficult to turn down an invitation to a wedding or a funeral, he said.
He himself has kept one foot firmly in gangland. Yakuza bosses call him frequently, asking for advice or for help smoothing over a conflict. The police, too, sought him out for updates on gang activity.
Mr. Ryuzaki didn't see a problem with his mob contacts. Or with the yakuza at all.
Like most of his colleagues, he saw the yakuza -- and himself -- as chivalrous, modern-day Robin Hoods, outsiders looking out for the little guy and dispensing justice when the authorities can't, or won't.
"I never did anything that bad," he said during an interview in his apartment on the top floor of an old high-rise. One wall was covered with luxury handbags he rents out to women who work in hostess clubs, and a sign in the bathroom instructed visitors to relieve themselves "prison style."
As he spoke, two older men in tracksuits and chains busied themselves ironing his shirts and straightening up.
Mr. Ryuzaki described himself as an "economic yakuza," specializing in real estate shakedowns. It was all in his forthcoming autobiography, "Necessary Evil," he said.
Much of his current work, he admitted, existed in a gray zone. He made high-interest loans and exploited loopholes in import laws. After one softball game, he pulled three blueberry-sized precious stones out of a bag and handed them to Mr. Takemoto, who inspected them with a jeweler's loupe. They were imported from Southeast Asia, he explained -- one of their many sidelines.
Both men have been arrested several times since leaving their gangs, but nothing has stuck. Mr. Ryuzaki insisted that the police were just out to get them.
"They want to take what's gray and claim it's black," he said.
'Nothing Good'
In July, the Ryuyukai won their first game. Their opponents were a group of drinking buddies who called themselves "The Secret Club." Mr. Ryuzaki was delighted by the victory but worried about his team's next opponent: another P.T.A., this one widely acknowledged to be the strongest team in the league.
On the day of that game, Mr. Takemoto brought Popsicles for everyone. The P.T.A. brought its A-game, scoring six runs in the first inning.
Afterward, Mr. Ryuzaki and Mr. Takemoto held court in their favorite postgame haunt, an old-fashioned coffee shop that served pork cutlets and spaghetti. The elderly owner wore a thin black bow tie, and the television above the counter was often tuned to the horse races, one of Japan's few forms of legal gambling.
Despite their complaints about the anti-yakuza laws, Mr. Ryuzaki and Mr. Takemoto maintain a seemingly opulent lifestyle. Mr. Takemoto wore a jewel-encrusted watch that he said had cost nearly $ 30,000. Members of the softball team regularly ferried the men around in luxury sedans.
The team sorted itself into a rigid hierarchy, with the former bosses on top. At lunch, players would sometimes stand in front of Mr. Ryuzaki and bow deeply, rice bowls lifted in both hands before them, as they shouted out their thanks to him for picking up the tab. On one rainy day, a man with a large black umbrella trailed Mr. Takemoto around the softball field, ensuring he stayed dry.
The ex-cons on the team clung to a flashy gangster image that belied their current living conditions. They wore sequined baseball hats. Loud colors. Tinted glasses. Everything branded (especially Louis Vuitton.) At one game, Mr. Ryuzaki handed out pink Christian Dior face masks. No one questioned their authenticity.
But their former lifestyles had left behind deeper scars than the occasional stab wound. A team stalwart, Masao, dropped out of school at 16 and spent years bouncing from gang to gang.
After his third prison sentence, he had a revelation. "Going to jail after 50 is a waste," he said. "Nothing good happens there."
Masao, who asked that his surname be withheld, is covered in tattoos and missing a finger he cut off after leaving one of the gangs. No one asked him to, he said, but he did it anyway, hoping his old associates would let him be. The bone didn't separate cleanly, though, and he ended up rushing to a hospital. His former bosses never got the finger; in the hubbub it ended up in a convenience store trash can.
He had gotten hooked on meth and still had a hard time resisting its pull. But the softball team had helped him stay clean, he said, and Mr. Takemoto had found him an apartment and a job. During the season, he was helping to service a water main.
Drug addiction was a particularly pernicious problem for many of the former gang members. Not everyone escaped it. In July, one team member killed himself after struggling with withdrawal.
At his wake in August, Mr. Ryuzaki and other team members greeted a stream of men in dark suits who had come to pay their respects. Many of them, Mr. Ryuzaki said, were active yakuza.
'Bad Habits'
The Ryuyukai's season ended on a humid October afternoon with a 15-0 loss. The opposing team's pitcher, a rare woman in the league, fired balls over the plate with a ferocity that made the Ryuyukai's players jump back.
One of those pitches struck Masao. He jokingly demanded a payoff. The pitcher bowed deeply and blushed.
At lunch afterward, Mr. Ryuzaki couldn't stop coughing. He needed treatment for lung disease after years of smoking. He huffed on an inhaler and cleared his throat.
He seemed unruffled by the loss. Or a season with just two wins. Covid had stopped the players from practicing. They would get their title back someday. And besides, winning wasn't the point.
"People have to stay busy or they fall back into bad habits," he said, picking at a plate of stir-fried ginger pork.
The conversation stopped, and everyone, as if at an invisible signal, got up to leave.
There was a chill in the air and no more softball until spring.
"Who wants to go bowling?" Mr. Ryuzaki asked.
They all jumped in their cars and drove to the lanes.

Broadway and West End Theater Owners Agree to Join Forces

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Jujamcyn Theaters, the smallest of the three big Broadway landlords, is combining its operations with a large British company, the Ambassador Theater Group, or ATG.
The transaction, confirmed Tuesday by Jujamcyn and International Entertainment Holdings Limited, which is ATG’s parent company, would give ATG, which already operates two of the 41 Broadway houses, a more sizable foothold in the heart of America’s theater industry, and would give Jujamcyn President Jordan Roth more resources for showcasing his creative ambitions. Jujamcyn operates five Broadway houses; ATG has 58 venues in Britain, Germany and the United States.
The companies said that the transaction is subject to regulatory approval, but did not say by what entity and in which country. No financial terms were specified.
Roth, one of the most colorful characters on Broadway’s business side, will become the creative director of the combined company and its largest individual shareholder, with a seat on the board. There are also significant institutional shareholders: A large Rhode Island-based private equity firm, Providence Equity Partners, has for the past decade been ATG’s majority shareholder, and at the height of the pandemic, when theaters were being financially squeezed by a lengthy shutdown, an Australian company, TEG, acquired a minority share of the company.
Roth, the 47-year-old son of real estate titan Steven Roth and Broadway producer Daryl Roth, has been a singular force in a staid industry, with a disruptive emphasis on customer service in his theaters, a fondness for couture, an exuberant presence on social media and left-leaning politics sharply at odds with those of his Trump-supporting father.
The transaction portends a potential shift from the quirky to the corporate: ATG is a large company, run by a former wine industry executive, Mark Cornell, who will remain as CEO of the combined company. ATG is fundamentally British, which could be a cause for concern on Broadway, where there is occasional worry about too many London shows — often developed with British government support — swamping work by American theater artists. (After Second Stage Theater, a nonprofit that focuses on work by living American writers, finally acquired a Broadway house in 2015, its artistic director, Carole Rothman, proudly proclaimed that her organization’s Broadway programming would feature “No Brits.”)
The companies, which would not make anyone available for comment, did not describe the transaction as either an acquisition or a merger, and it is not immediately clear what “combining operations” will mean for the employees or operations at the five Jujamcyn houses or the two ATG Broadway houses.
The Jujamcyn theaters include the Eugene O’Neill, which is the long-term home of “The Book of Mormon,” as well as the Al Hirschfeld (“Moulin Rouge!”), the Walter Kerr (“Hadestown”), the August Wilson (“Funny Girl”) and the St. James (awaiting a new musical called “New York, New York”). Roth is expected to continue to decide what shows run in those five theaters, and he has previously shown a strong interest in work by American writers: Four of the five current Jujamcyn musicals have American origins; “Moulin Rouge!” has Australian roots, although the stage musical was developed in the United States.
ATG has an ambitious Broadway track record thus far. The company has for a decade operated one of the biggest Broadway houses, the Lyric, which, lavishly reconfigured for 1,622 seats, has for the past five years been home to “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.” ATG has since 2017 also operated one of Broadway's smaller houses, the Hudson, which with just under 1,000 seats often presents plays; the latest, a revival of “A Doll’s House” starring Jessica Chastain, began previews Monday night. Among the hallmarks of the company’s Broadway presence: fancier food and drink than at most of the American-operated houses.
Notably, both “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” and “A Doll’s House” are produced by companies financed by ATG. A lead producer of “Cursed Child” is Sonia Friedman, a prolific and powerful London-based producer whose production company is an ATG affiliate; the director of “A Doll’s House” is Jamie Lloyd, a Briton whose production company is also affiliated with the group. (Friedman is also a lead producer of “Funny Girl” and “New York, New York,” both running at Jujamcyn theaters.)
The combination of ATG and Jujamcyn — it is not clear what the amalgamated venture will be called — will still be the smallest of the three big Broadway landlords, but now with seven of the 41 theaters. The Shubert Organization has 17 theaters and the Nederlander Organization has nine. Six theaters are operated by nonprofits, one by Disney, and one (Circle in the Square) is independently owned.
Jujamcyn, founded in the late 1950s, was named for Judy, James and Cynthia Binger, the grandchildren of the company’s founder. The Binger family sold the company to Rocco Landesman in 2005; Jordan Roth bought a stake in the company in 2009.
Roth has been an activist theater owner. In the buildings, he has overseen everything from a redesign of the ice cubes (to reduce the clinking noise) to bringing in a new ticket seller, SeatGeek, to manage ticket sales.
He has presented multiple hit shows, among the biggest of which has been “The Book of Mormon,” which has been running since 2011. He also landed “Springsteen on Broadway,” an enormously successful Bruce Springsteen concert show that had runs both before and after the pandemic shutdown.
Roth has also been active as a producer, most recently transferring a concert-style production of “Into the Woods” from City Center to the St. James; he was also a producer of the Tony-winning 2018 revival of “Angels in America.”
ATG has been expanding its presence in the United States, where it now owns, operates or manages 16 theaters, including not only the two Broadway houses, but also the King’s Theater in Brooklyn, the Colonial Theater in Boston, and theaters in Detroit, New Orleans, San Antonio, San Francisco and Sugar Land, Texas.

The Redstone Family Drama: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Stewart, James B; Abrams, Rachel

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On Sunday, May 13, 2018, Leslie Moonves, the chairman and chief executive of CBS, faced a difficult decision, perhaps the most agonizing of his long and celebrated media career: whether to pull the trigger on a coup against the Redstone family, which controlled CBS.
"This is NUCLEAR," Mr. Moonves wrote that afternoon to Bruce S. Gordon, a former president of the N.A.A.C.P. and a close confidant on the network's board.
The philandering and increasingly infirm 94-year-old Sumner Redstone, the patriarch who assembled CBS, the Paramount film studio and a bevy of cable networks under the Viacom umbrella into a multibillion-dollar media and entertainment empire, had let Mr. Moonves run CBS as he saw fit.
But now Shari Redstone, Mr. Redstone's daughter, was solidifying her hold. She had managed to separate her father from the growing influence of his two live-in companions, one purportedly his fiancée, with a nine-carat diamond to prove it. Ms. Redstone had recently stocked the Viacom board with her allies, who had then replaced the company's long-serving chief executive with her choice for the job -- something that Mr. Moonves feared would soon happen at CBS.
After Mr. Redstone divided his empire into two publicly traded but Redstone-controlled companies -- CBS and Viacom -- in 2006, Mr. Moonves had led CBS out of last place in the ratings and made it the most consistently watched broadcast network. But now Ms. Redstone wanted to merge the much healthier CBS with a floundering Viacom, and was consulting with Mr. Moonves -- meddling, in his view -- on a regular basis.
As Mr. Moonves had implored one board director: "Help me here. Shari is driving me crazy."
He showed no sign of this to Ms. Redstone, with whom he continued to discuss the merger. But while she thought he was open to her ideas, Mr. Moonves and his supporters on the CBS board had secretly plotted a board vote to strip the Redstones of their voting control and block the merger. Then CBS would immediately sue in Delaware to prevent Ms. Redstone, her father and the family trust that controlled their assets from replacing CBS board members or otherwise nullifying the board's action. This was the "nuclear" option -- a legal gambit with profound implications for every public company with a controlling shareholder, which includes many of the biggest media and tech companies.
"After filing there can't be a deal," Mr. Moonves continued in his message to Mr. Gordon. Referring to Ms. Redstone: "She won't be manageable."
"She's not manageable now," Mr. Gordon responded.
Today Shari Redstone ranks among the most powerful executives in Hollywood. As nonexecutive chair she oversees Paramount Global, the company that emerged from the combination of CBS and Viacom, home to such hits as last summer's "Top Gun: Maverick" and the current streaming series "Yellowstone."
Mr. Moonves, by contrast, was fired from CBS after more than a dozen women, including his own doctor, accused him of sexual misconduct; was denied $ 120 million in severance payments; and retreated in disgrace to his homes in Beverly Hills and Malibu, Calif. Initially a reluctant participant in her father's business empire, intimidated by the big names attending the annual media conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, Ms. Redstone not only survived the "nuclear" option but emerged on top.
A trove of documents and testimony helps explain how she did it -- in part through her own "mettle," as her father might have put it, and in part thanks to some startling revelations that Mr. Moonves did his best to conceal from a board of directors who showed little interest in thoroughly investigating his past.
This account is drawn from our forthcoming book, "Unscripted: The Epic Battle for a Media Empire and the Redstone Family Legacy," and based on scores of interviews with participants conducted over three years. Many were on a not-for-attribution basis because of litigation and nondisclosure agreements. We reviewed numerous texts and emails exchanged among Mr. Moonves, CBS executives and board members, including those quoted above.
Through a spokesman, Mr. Moonves declined to comment. Ms. Redstone responded to questions either directly or through a spokesperson, and participated in fact-checking.
'Does not have the requisite business judgment'
That Ms. Redstone would ever be in a position to challenge Mr. Moonves -- or any of her father's other handpicked male executives -- once seemed unfathomable to anyone who knew the family's dynamic. The irascible Mr. Redstone had belittled and marginalized his daughter (and had driven his son, Brent, to abandon the business and family entirely and retreat to a Colorado ranch).
Mr. Redstone had long disparaged his daughter to Viacom executives, board members -- practically anyone who would listen. He pelted her with profanity-laced emails and faxes, according to several former Viacom executives who were copied on the missives. When his longtime lawyer and confidant, George Abrams, among those who saw the messages, begged Mr. Redstone not to use such hurtful language, he erupted, insisting he'd call his daughter whatever he pleased.
By 2007, father and daughter were barely speaking, communicating through faxes and lawyers. Fissures within the family were so widely known within CBS that employees would joke that the Redstones gave each other subpoenas for Christmas.
In a letter to trustees of his family trust that year, Mr. Redstone stated bluntly that "Ms. Redstone does not have the requisite business judgment and abilities to serve as chairman."
He took his disparaging views public in a letter to Forbes that July: "While my daughter talks of good governance, she apparently ignores the cardinal rule of good governance that the boards of the two public companies, Viacom and CBS, should select my successor."
'If there are any stories out there, we need to know'
When he was healthy, Mr. Redstone seemed certain that his daughter should not succeed him. That all appeared to change as his health, ability to speak and mental capacity deteriorated, especially after he ejected his romantic companions from his Beverly Hills mansion.
Over time, he increasingly depended on his daughter for his care and to interpret his wishes. Ms. Redstone emerged as his heir apparent, a powerful executive in her own right and the de facto chairman of her father's companies. This was the situation deemed intolerable by Mr. Moonves and his allies.
As the CBS board contemplated the "nuclear" option in early 2018, Mr. Moonves was well aware that far more was at stake than just the Redstone family's corporate control.
After articles in The New York Times and The New Yorker about Harvey Weinstein's serial abuse of women ushered in the #MeToo era, which encouraged sexual assault victims to speak publicly, rumors began circulating that Mr. Moonves would soon be another major media executive to be felled by accusations of misconduct. Ms. Redstone heard those rumors, too.
"There is a lot of noise here at CES," she emailed another board member, referring to the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January 2018.
According to another widespread rumor, Ronan Farrow, who had written the Weinstein exposé for The New Yorker, was at work on an article about Mr. Moonves.
Not all CBS directors were eager to get to the bottom of the rumors, but after Ms. Redstone's prodding, they hired Michael Aiello, a partner at Weil Gotshal & Manges, to interview Mr. Moonves about any potential accusations that could become public. Little did Ms. Redstone realize that her own future would turn on revelations about Mr. Moonves's past sexual misconduct.
"If there are any stories out there, we need to know," Mr. Aiello began a call with Mr. Moonves on Jan. 16, 2018, according to a lawyer's notes of the interview that were reviewed by The Times.
Mr. Moonves said there were two instances of possible concern, both decades in the past, long before his employment by CBS.
In the first, a young actress had come in for a meeting when he was at Warner Bros. He didn't know her. He said that he had exposed himself and that she "ran out of room," according to the notes.
"Let me take a step back," Mr. Aiello said. "What does 'exposed' mean?"
This time, Mr. Moonves said they had engaged in consensual oral sex. Afterward, he heard from her manager that the actress was "upset." The manager said that he had gotten calls from The Times, and that there was "buzz" about what had happened.
The second incident, Mr. Moonves said, involved a female television executive who had recently filed a police complaint against him for sexual assault. But the incident dated to the 1980s, and the statute of limitations had expired long ago, which would prevent any charges. In any event, he said, the sex was consensual.
That was pretty much the end of the investigation. No one asked Mr. Moonves the names of the women, let alone tried to hear their accounts.
Mr. Aiello assured the board that while there had been times when Mr. Moonves might have been "clumsy" and made "unwanted advances," there was nothing to worry about. Asked by one director for details about any incidents, Mr. Aiello seemed squeamish. He said that the board "didn't want to know" and that he "didn't want to go there."
Mr. Aiello declined comment for the book and didn't respond to requests for comment on this article.
Later that month, Ms. Redstone had lunch alone with Mr. Moonves at his office in Los Angeles. She laid out her long-term plans -- CBS and Viacom would merge and then be in a stronger position to compete or be acquired by another company. As she had said before, she didn't want to be a media mogul -- she was looking forward to focusing on her family and her other ventures. Was Mr. Moonves on board?
He said he was.
Mr. Moonves, she said, was essential to the plan. There was also the delicate issue of the #MeToo rumors. Ms. Redstone asked Mr. Moonves if there was any truth to them.
He told her to look him in the eyes. He assured her there was nothing to be concerned about.
'A public war for 6 months'
In May, as the "nuclear" option loomed, Mr. Moonves was clearly worried about Ms. Redstone's concerns. Even if he thought he had done nothing wrong, sexual abuse accusations alone -- should they ever become public -- were potentially ruinous to him and fatal to any lawsuit against the Redstones.
Mr. Moonves anguished over the decision, even trying to back out of the carefully orchestrated attack. In a series of texts produced in the Delaware litigation, he wrote to CBS's head of communications, his close ally Gil Schwartz, on May 13:
"I can't do this. I do not want to file. It will be a public war for 6 months. I am not emotionally prepared for this. I would rather leave. Sorry."
It fell to Bruce Gordon, the board confidant, to coax Mr. Moonves back. Mr. Gordon wasn't entirely surprised that Mr. Moonves was wavering. But he was convinced that a merger was not in the interest of CBS shareholders and had to be stopped.
The CBS board convened by phone that day to consider the attack on the Redstone family. With the meeting in progress, Mr. Gordon texted with Mr. Moonves, alternately sympathizing and cajoling: "I really don't think you want to do this. You are destroying your credibility."
"I am not ready for the fight," Mr. Moonves replied. "I can't do it. 6 months of attacks. No."
Mr. Moonves agonized that if he supported the board vote to dilute the Redstones' voting power and to file the ensuing lawsuit, Ms. Redstone would attack him with all the ammunition she could muster. If he didn't, he'd lose the support of the board members still loyal to him.
"I am sick either way," Mr. Moonves added. "I have never felt worse." He continued, "A public spectacle." Ms. Redstone "wants to run it. Let's let her."
Minutes later, Mr. Gordon texted Mr. Moonves that it was time for him to join the board call.
"I think we will add you on momentarily. You ready?"
Somehow Mr. Gordon had talked him back from the brink. Mr. Moonves had done another about-face and was ready to go ahead.
"Less is more," Mr. Gordon advised him. "Leave us the flexibility to work details this week."
Mr. Moonves joined the board call in progress just after 3 p.m. In minutes of the meeting reviewed by The Times, he said the board members had his full support in its decision to block the merger and sue the Redstones.
The board members on the call essentially had to choose between Ms. Redstone and Mr. Moonves and believed Mr. Moonves to be essential to the health of the enterprise. It voted unanimously that a merger with Viacom was not in the interest of CBS shareholders except for the Redstones.
The board members voted unanimously to go ahead with the plan.
After the vote, Mr. Gordon checked in with Mr. Moonves.
"You ok?" he texted.
"Yes," Mr. Moonves answered. It was only about 5:40 p.m., but he was already drinking. "On my third vodka and second egg roll. Go time."
As the evening went on, Mr. Moonves was still worrying about Ms. Redstone in texts to Joseph Ianniello, CBS's chief operating officer and a close ally. "She will come after me big time. I know you have my back!!! She threw us under the bus when not under pressure. Now??? Wow ... She will be enraged."
An hour and a half later, Mr. Moonves threw down the gauntlet.
"Mattresses tomorrow am," he texted Mr. Ianniello, in a reference to "The Godfather." "And take the gun. We need it."
The next morning, May 14, Ms. Redstone was at her apartment high in the tower of the Pierre Hotel in New York. Central Park sprawled outside her windows, its landscape a vivid green with spring foliage.
At 9:30 a.m. she received an email saying there would be a special CBS board meeting that Thursday. That was the first that Ms. Redstone had heard about any special board meeting.
She called one of her lawyers, Christopher Austin at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton in New York.
"What's this about a board meeting?"
"I'm afraid it's worse than that," Mr. Austin replied. "You've been sued. In Delaware."
"What?"
Mr. Austin outlined the claims: Ms. Redstone was plotting to replace the CBS directors. She had violated her duty to shareholders. Her fellow board members wanted to strip her, her father and her family of their control. As she saw it, they wanted to steal the company her father had built.
Ms. Redstone wandered through the apartment in a daze. She had just decided to drop the merger idea if Mr. Moonves didn't support it. For all their difficulties, she believed she and Mr. Moonves were friends.
At least that's what she had thought.
In Los Angeles it was just after 6:30 a.m., so Ms. Redstone texted Rob Klieger, her lawyer and fellow CBS director.
"I've been sued in Delaware. Call me. They've declared war."
'I am frankly ashamed'
CBS won Round 1 of the court battle, gaining a temporary restraining order preventing the Redstones from rewriting the bylaws or replacing the board members. But a new factor in the continued tenure of Mr. Moonves was looming outside the courtroom.
The rumor that Ronan Farrow was working on a Moonves article for The New Yorker turned out to be true. On July 27, the magazine published an exposé featuring the accounts of six women: "Les Moonves and CBS face allegations of sexual misconduct."
After reading the article, Ms. Redstone could barely contain her anger and frustration. All of it had come as a shock, notwithstanding the months of rumors.
She and Mr. Klieger were astonished that no one from the board or CBS had called them after the article came out. Yet the independent directors, those not aligned with Ms. Redstone and for the most part staunch supporters of Mr. Moonves, had gone ahead without consulting them and issued a public statement saying Mr. Moonves had the board's "full support."
Ms. Redstone fired off a letter to her fellow directors.
"I am frankly ashamed to sit on a board with independent directors who have demonstrated such blind allegiance to senior management and repeatedly failed to act in the best interests of the company, its employees and its shareholders," the letter began. (The letter was reviewed by The Times.)
She was especially critical of the board's previous investigation of the rumors about Mr. Moonves. Mr. Aiello's interview had seemed, to her, perfunctory at best. How could the board have expressed its support for Mr. Moonves when it had done almost nothing to investigate?
"While rumors and allegations are not fact, they do require board action, particularly given the intensity with which they were circulating," she wrote. "The board does not discharge its obligations by asking the C.E.O. if he engaged in any misconduct and taking his word for it when he says he did not."
She added that she had nothing to do with the New Yorker's investigation: "I have never spoken to Ronan Farrow, nor have I spoken with any of the women who have leveled accusations against Les."
'We all did that'
The board convened by phone on Monday morning, July 30, in executive session, which meant Mr. Moonves was excluded. Mr. Klieger and Ms. Redstone participated from offices at Cleary Gottlieb.
By then, sexual misconduct allegations had led to the firing of media celebrities like Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose. CBS itself, like many companies, had issued public statements that such conduct wouldn't be tolerated. Despite this, a cadre of CBS directors had no interest in discussion and had already made up their minds to support Mr. Moonves, according to the accounts of several directors who were at the meeting.
Arnold Kopelson, who won a best-picture Academy Award for producing "Platoon," was especially ardent in his support for Mr. Moonves, dismissing the New Yorker incidents as ancient history. He kept repeating that it was pilot season, when CBS most needed Mr. Moonves's golden touch.
At another point, according to those in the room, he insisted, "We all did that," referring to the allegations against Mr. Moonves. Mr. Kopelson subsequently emailed all his fellow directors: "I don't care if a hundred women come forward. Les is our leader and we have to stand behind him." (Other directors confirmed these remarks; Mr. Kopelson died not long after these events. The Times reviewed a copy of his email to the directors.)
There was also considerable talk about the likely negative reaction on Wall Street if Mr. Moonves was suspended, given that he was closely linked with CBS's success.
The directors didn't have to stay until midnight to resolve their differences. They seemed only too happy to embrace a suggestion from Mr. Klieger, the Redstone lawyer and board member, to wait until they heard from the outside lawyers hired for an independent investigation -- anything to delay removing Mr. Moonves. The meeting adjourned in less than an hour.
Amid intense speculation about Mr. Moonves's fate, CBS issued a statement saying that the board was "in the process of selecting outside counsel to conduct an independent investigation" and that "no other action was taken on this matter at today's board meeting."
Few were satisfied, either on Wall Street or beyond.
But unlike Harvey Weinstein, Matt Lauer or Charlie Rose, Mr. Moonves had survived.
'Naïveté about what he needs to disclose'
In the wake of the New Yorker article, CBS directors had finally agreed that the company needed an independent investigation. But even then, the warring factions couldn't agree on a firm. So they compromised by hiring lawyers from two different firms -- Mary Jo White, a former head of the Securities and Exchange Commission and a partner at Debevoise & Plimpton, and Nancy Kestenbaum, a former federal prosecutor and a partner at Covington & Burling.
Their investigation focused less on the instances uncovered by The New Yorker and more on the two that Mr. Moonves disclosed when Mr. Aiello interviewed him the previous year: the actress, Bobbie Phillips, and the television executive, Phyllis Golden-Gottlieb.
Only now did the lawyers learn that more than 20 years after the alleged incident, the actress's manager, Marv Dauer, had been pressuring Mr. Moonves for months to cast Ms. Phillips, and that Mr. Moonves had approached CBS's casting head about the matter. Ms. Phillips had even been offered a part without having to audition or submit a tape.
This revelation came as a bombshell to the lawyers. A 30-year-old allegation of a sexual assault was one thing. But the casting conversation had just happened. It suggested that Mr. Moonves had wanted to cover up the incident, using company resources to silence a potential threat. And he hadn't told them about it.
Ms. White and Ms. Kestenbaum briefed members of the board. They gave an account of an interview they had with Mr. Moonves the previous day, touching on the police report, the actress and the incidents reported in The New Yorker, according to notes of the meeting reviewed by The Times. Ms. Kestenbaum summed up Mr. Moonves's response: "There were times when he would feel an attraction, think it was mutual, make an overture, and if he got rebuffed, he would leave it alone."
Ms. White continued, "Our sense is that whatever occurred, you don't see that after he gets married. Appears to have a 14-year period without this activity. We asked him what else might be out there. He said there was a time when I was dating, there could be something there, but all consensual. He mentioned an encounter with a female doctor, which was rebuffed. Wouldn't give the name or any details."
Then Ms. Kestenbaum mentioned the revelations about the actress and her manager. Mr. Moonves's lawyer "described this scenario as a shakedown," Ms. White said, according to the notes.
"In our view, this raises serious concerns both with respect to candor and forthrightness and the fact that Les took steps with human resources of CBS," Ms. Kestenbaum added.
Ms. White said the "other risk is what I would call naïveté about what he needs to disclose and what is risk," adding, "No one heard about the actress and getting her a job."
She seemed especially concerned that while Mr. Moonves recognized the personal risk -- "his stomach is churning" -- he didn't recognize the larger risk to the company that needed to be disclosed.
Ms. Kestenbaum continued: "In light of recent events, with the casting director, we are recommending that there be a change in status. We now think there is something new. Troubling."
"This is a deal breaker," she concluded.
'And now the end is here'
This was effectively the end of Mr. Moonves's career at CBS. He was fired on Sept. 9, 2018. With him gone, the "nuclear option" lawsuit collapsed just days later, when both sides agreed to dismiss the case. CBS and Viacom merged in 2019, and were renamed Paramount Global.
Ms. Redstone had finally prevailed. But the empire she now controlled was beset by new competitive threats and upheavals in the media landscape.
There's no question that combining CBS and Viacom allowed the company to gain greater scale. But Wall Street analysts were skeptical. And by the measure that Sumner Redstone cared most about -- the stock price -- the merger has failed to stem the company's decline. The combined market capitalization of Viacom and CBS was $ 30 billion when the merger was announced in 2019. Paramount Global's valuation is about half that. It was up against competitors that were many times larger: Amazon (market capitalization of over $ 1 trillion), Netflix (about $ 160 billion) and Walt Disney (about $ 200 billion).
While its competitors seized the opportunities presented by the digital revolution, Viacom and CBS lost precious years to their internal struggles. It's safe to say the intracompany warfare before 2018 delivered the worst possible outcome -- neither a merger of CBS and Viacom nor a sale to someone else.
It's not clear to what extent Mr. Redstone understood or was able to savor his daughter's win. Peter Bart, who was a longtime editor of Variety and close to Mr. Redstone, was granted a rare visit in 2019.
"His withered hand signaled a greeting, or the semblance of one," Mr. Bart reported in a column for Deadline Hollywood. "His eyes flickered weakly, but his effort at conversation was reduced to a grunt, mixed with an occasional scream of rage and frustration over his limitations." Mr. Redstone was bedridden, being fed intravenously, and "a team of nurses and conservators stand by for needed assistance," Mr. Bart observed.
On the morning of Aug. 11, 2020, Mr. Redstone's nurse called Ms. Redstone to tell her she thought the end was near.
Ms. Redstone told the nurse to put warmers on her father's hands and to hold him. She kept the phone line open so her father could hear her talk.
Over the next several hours, she reviewed his life's accomplishments. She promised to take care of the family and to nurture the business empire he had created. "It will be here forever," she assured him. "I love you," she said over and over.
Finally the nurse told her that Mr. Redstone had quietly stopped breathing.
He was 97. National Amusements, the family's holding company, announced his death, describing him as "the self-made businessman, philanthropist and World War II veteran who built one of the largest collections of media assets in the world."
Despite the father and daughter's late-in-life reconciliation, Ms. Redstone could never be certain she had gained her father's love or approval given his impaired faculties.
Just after Mr. Redstone died, Ms. Redstone reached out to Tad Jankowski, her father's friend and longtime business colleague, for reassurance. Had she done the right thing? she wondered, citing the changes on the Viacom board and the firing of Mr. Moonves. Would her father have approved? Had he really loved her?
What could he say? Mr. Jankowski emphasized that Mr. Redstone had loved a fight and loved to win. Ms. Redstone had never given up. He would be proud of her.
Mr. Redstone's remains were flown to his hometown, Boston. Ms. Redstone and two of her children accompanied the hearse to the family plot at Sharon Memorial Park. Because of the pandemic, no one else was present except for Ms. Redstone's ex-husband, a rabbi, who conducted the burial ceremony.
The gathering was so intimate that Ms. Redstone felt no need to restrain her emotions. She knelt so close to the grave her children worried she might fall in. Between bouts of crying, she told her father everything she had ever wanted to say to him.
Finally she stopped. "Is there anything else?" she asked.
Her daughter reminded her that Mr. Redstone had asked that Frank Sinatra's recording of "My Way" be played at his funeral. Ms. Redstone had always cringed on the many occasions her father insisted on listening to it. But now she asked her daughter to pull up the lyrics on her phone. Ms. Redstone began singing:
And now the end is here
And so I face that final curtain
She struggled through the five verses, each ending with the refrain:
"I did it my way."

Interest Rates Weigh on Markets Again: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks dropped Thursday following another mixed set of profit reports from companies, as rising expectations for interest rates keep up the pressure on Wall Street.
The S&P 500 fell 0.9 percent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.7 percent and the Nasdaq composite sank 1 percent. All three indexes had been up by close to 1 percent in the morning, before momentum gave out.
Stocks have been shaky this week amid uncertainty about where interest rates and inflation are heading. A strong jobs market has investors buying more into the Federal Reserve's forecast that it will raise rates a couple of more times before holding them at a high level through this year.
A narrowing disconnect between markets and the Fed could lead to less volatility in markets in the future, said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. But for now, with a jumble of earnings reports pouring in from companies along Wall Street and questions remaining about whether the economy can avoid a sharp recession, swings are likely to remain.
"There's continuing evidence that the economy is stronger than people thought it was going to be," Mr. Martin said. "The question is what is the economy's ability to continue that resilience in the face of interest rates that are a lot higher than they were a year ago."
In the bond market, at least, a warning signal is continuing to flash red with yields on shorter-term Treasurys well above longer-term Treasurys. It's an unusual occurrence that has often preceded recessions in the past.
The two-year Treasury yield, which tends to move with expectations for Fed action, climbed to 4.48 percent from 4.43 percent late Wednesday. It reached its highest level since mid-November during the day, according to Tradeweb. The 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and other loans, rose to 3.68 percent.
"We're still somewhere in that 40 percent to 60 percent area of a recession," Mr. Martin said. "I'm not trying to be wishy-washy about it, but there are so many ways to go. The level of uncertainty has been high and remains high."
High inflation and worries about a slowing economy have already begun to hit corporate earnings, and big U.S. companies have been reporting relatively lackluster results for the end of 2022.
The Walt Disney Co. surprised the market when it reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also said it will cut about 7,000 jobs as part of a plan to reduce its costs by $ 5.5 billion. Its shares fell 1.3 percent after being up more than 5 percent earlier in the morning.
The media giant joined the growing list of high-profile companies to announce layoffs amid an uncertain economy. The bulk began in the technology industry, where companies acknowledged misreading the boom coming out of the pandemic and hiring too many people. Job cuts have since spread to other industries.
"Things have gotten good on the inflation front, but now I think the next cause of volatility is beginning to shift to recession fears," said Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company.
Overall, though, the job market has remained resilient. Last week, 196,000 U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits. That was slightly more than the prior week, but it remained below the 200,000 level for a fourth straight week.
While a strong job market is good for workers and for sales of companies selling to them, the Federal Reserve also worries that it could lead to upward pressure on inflation.
Another drop for Google's parent company, Alphabet, also weighed heavily on the market. It fell 4.4 percent, continuing its rough week amid worries about competition from Microsoft, which recently unveiled a new Bing search engine powered by artificial intelligence.

Full text: Dudamel, a charismatic 42-year-old conductor, will take up the Philharmonic's podium in 2026, in a major coup for the orchestra.
LOS ANGELES -- Gustavo Dudamel, the charismatic conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, whose fiery baton and bouncy curls have made him one of classical music's most recognizable figures, will leave his post in 2026 to become the music director of the New York Philharmonic, both orchestras announced on Tuesday.
"What I see is an amazing orchestra in New York and a lot of potential for developing something important," he said in an interview. "It's like opening a new door and building a new house. It's a beautiful time."
The appointment of Dudamel, 42, is a major coup for the New York Philharmonic, the oldest symphony orchestra in the United States, which was once led by giants including Mahler, Toscanini and Bernstein. Just a decade ago, there were concerns about its future, given the languishing efforts to renovate its lackluster hall and questions about its artistic direction. Now its home, David Geffen Hall, has reopened after a $ 550 million renovation, and it has secured in Dudamel the rare maestro whose fame transcends classical music, even as he is sought by the world's leading ensembles.
His departure is a significant loss for Los Angeles, where since 2009 Dudamel has helped build a vast cultural empire and helped turn the orchestra into one of the most innovative and financially successful in the United States.
He was lured east by Deborah Borda, the New York Philharmonic's powerful president and chief executive, in an instance of classical music history repeating itself. She signed the 26-year-old Dudamel to the Los Angeles Philharmonic back when she led that ensemble, and helped make him a superstar in its relatively new Walt Disney Concert Hall. Now she hopes to repeat that success in New York.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"It's a wonderful match," said Borda, who arranged the deal in one of her last big pieces of business before she steps down from her post at the end of June. "I'm joyous for our orchestra. I'm joyous for our city."
The terms of the deal were not disclosed. Dudamel, one of the highest-paid artists in the industry, earned $ 2.8 million during a recent season in Los Angeles. In New York, he will be given the expanded title of music and artistic director, to match his current role. He will succeed Jaap van Zweden -- first as music director designate in the 2025-26 season, then as the orchestra's 27th music director in the 2026-27 season -- with an initial contract for five years.
Dudamel, who was born in Venezuela, will be the orchestra's first Hispanic leader, in a city where Latinos make up about 29 percent of the population. His appointment comes as the Philharmonic has worked to connect with new audiences, especially young people and Black and Latino residents.
Classical music audiences typically skew older, but Dudamel is a rare figure who has been able to galvanize traditionalists and newcomers alike. He has made nurturing a younger generation of artists and music fans a priority, building a youth orchestra in Los Angeles modeled on El Sistema -- the Venezuelan-based movement, in which he trained, that weds teaching and social work.
And he is unique among modern conductors for his pop-culture celebrity. Dudamel has appeared in a Super Bowl halftime show and voiced Trollzart in the animated film "Trolls World Tour." He inspired the wunderkind Latin American conductor played by Gael García Bernal on the Amazon series "Mozart in the Jungle" and made a cameo appearance on the show. ("Hear the Hair" was its parody of a classical music marketing campaign.) In addition to making recordings with the Berlin Philharmonic and the Vienna Philharmonic, he has conducted on soundtracks of a recent "Star Wars" film and Steven Spielberg's version of "West Side Story." In 2019, he was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
Dudamel now faces the difficult task of attempting to raise the New York Philharmonic's standing in American cultural life while helping it navigate a series of challenges, including dwindling ticket revenues, shifting audience behavior since the pandemic and persistent questions about the relevance of classical music and live performance today.
Dudamel said that as music and artistic director, he would champion new music and work to develop the orchestra's sound, now that the musicians had a hall in which they could fully hear each other onstage.
"There are no limits, especially in an orchestra with such a history," he said. "I see an incredible infinite potential of building something unique for the world."
Dudamel, who has been the music director of the Paris Opera since 2021, and of the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela since 1999, was a favorite for the podium in New York as soon as it became vacant. In the fall of 2021, van Zweden announced that he would step down at the end of the 2023-24 season after a six-year tenure.
When Dudamel appeared at the Philharmonic last spring, for a two-program Schumann symphony cycle, some players, hoping to win him over, showed up to rehearsals bearing gifts and handwritten notes. Inside his dressing room, a group of musicians gave him a bottle of the Brooklyn-made Widow Jane bourbon, telling him the Philharmonic would welcome him if he could find a way to spend more time in New York.
"Everything comes alive with him," said Christopher Martin, the orchestra's principal trumpet. "Everything is as natural as breathing."
Borda said that it was Dudamel's long and fruitful relationship with the Philharmonic -- he has led 26 concerts with the orchestra since his debut in 2007 -- that had made him the choice of the musicians, board members and managers. She recounted meeting him secretly in various European cities over the past year, often flying in and out within 24 hours to avoid suspicion, as she tried to secure a deal. (Seeing him in Los Angeles, she said, "just didn't feel kosher.")
In October, when Dudamel was in New York to perform at Carnegie Hall with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, she took him on a tour of the renovated hall during a rehearsal, taking a circuitous route to sneak him onto the third tier so that even the orchestra's musicians would not know. The attempt at secrecy was foiled when they bumped into Lin-Manuel Miranda, who was preparing for a gala performance.
The secrecy was broken on Tuesday afternoon when the New York Philharmonic's musicians were summoned for an announcement shortly after a rehearsal with the guest conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen. Some worried that the news would be bad; only members of the orchestra committee knew what the meeting would be about.
With the players reunited onstage, Borda and her successor, Gary Ginstling, stepped onto the podium.
"Our next music director will be," Borda said, with a pause, "Gustavo Dudamel."
The musicians erupted into 20 seconds of applause, in a journey from wide-eyed surprise to whistles and cheers, genuine expressions of joy. Judith LeClair, the bassoonist, was the most animated of them, looking dumbfounded before holding a radiant smile through the rest of Borda's speech.
"The Philharmonic has had its ups and downs," Borda told them. "And it had an amazing time in the '60s, when we were golden," she added, referring to Bernstein's music directorship. "I really feel the promise of that again."
Afterward, members of the orchestra were visibly elated. The oboist Ryan Roberts, who grew up in Los Angeles, called his mother there: "Mom, guess who our new music director is." She could be heard responding with Dudamel's name, virtually screaming with excitement.
The appointment of Dudamel is the latest chapter in a remarkable career. Born in the Barquisimeto, Venezuela, he grew up in a musical family: His mother was a voice teacher, and his father a trombonist who played in salsa bands. He enrolled in El Sistema as a child and studied violin and composition before pursuing conducting.
He sometimes faced questions about his ties to Venezuelan leaders -- he conducted at the funeral of President Hugo Chávez -- but tried to remain above the political fray. But in 2017, after a young El Sistema-trained viola player was killed during a street protest, Dudamel issued a statement that said "enough is enough" and wrote an opinion piece in The New York Times accusing the government of flouting the Venezuelan constitution. President Nicolás Maduro canceled several overseas tours by Dudamel and the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra as punishment, and Dudamel did not return to Venezuela until a quiet trip late last year.
Dudamel has been a champion of new music, collaborating in Los Angeles with composers including John Adams and Gabriela Ortiz. He has also joined forces with pop and jazz stars, such as Billie Eilish and Herbie Hancock. The New York Times critic Zachary Woolfe wrote in 2017 that the Los Angeles Philharmonic was "the most important orchestra in America. Period."
At the New York Philharmonic, Dudamel will lead an organization that is smaller than his Los Angeles empire, and one that has struggled in recent decades with financial troubles. The Los Angeles Philharmonic, with its Frank Gehry-designed Disney Hall as well as the Hollywood Bowl, garnered about $ 187 million in yearly revenue before the pandemic. The New York Philharmonic earned $ 86 million.
Chad Smith, the chief executive of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, congratulated Dudamel on the move, praised his tenure there for leaving "indelible marks on classical music" and hinted at the orchestra's next steps.
"From our earliest days, the L.A. Phil has been a trailblazer, boldly embracing the new, welcoming the world's greatest artists to our stages and redefining the role of an orchestra in our community," he said in a statement. "The search for our next music director will be conducted with this same spirit as we define the future of our organization."
Dudamel broke the news on Tuesday to Los Angeles players after a rehearsal, telling them that he would always be an Angeleno.
Dale Breidenthal, a violinist in the orchestra, said Dudamel's departure was stunning for the ensemble. "We haven't processed it," she said on her way out from the rehearsal. Still, she added, New York needed his talents. "We are really excited for him," she said.
Dudamel said he did not expect to build a replica of the Los Angeles Philharmonic in New York. "It's impossible," he said. "They are completely different cultures."
Still, he said, he would like to explore the idea of creating a youth education program similar to his efforts in Los Angeles. "It will be very important that we really develop social action through music," he said. "For artistic institutions in the world, it's important to embrace and to build. It will be very beautiful."
Borda, who returned to New York in 2017 after 17 years at the helm of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, balanced the New York Philharmonic's budget and built up its once-depleted endowment. She also helped bring to fruition the long-delayed renovation of Geffen Hall, working with Henry Timms, the president and chief executive of Lincoln Center, to push it through ahead of schedule during the pandemic shutdown.
That renovation has helped to revitalize the orchestra; speaking with the players on Tuesday, Borda told them, "It's really because of you that he's coming" but added, "And I have to say, it doesn't hurt to have a nicer hall."
Paid attendance so far this season has hovered around 88 percent, compared with 74 percent before the pandemic, though the revamped hall is somewhat smaller. But the ensemble is still grappling with a host of questions about its identity and vision.
Borda offered Dudamel two gifts while wooing him. One, given early in the search, was a program book from a Philharmonic tour of Venezuela in 1958, with a cover designed by the artist Carlos Cruz-Diez.
The other, which he received as the deal was being finalized, was a pencil that was used to compose music by an artist who will now be his predecessor: Leonard Bernstein.
Dudamel said in the interview that he would always maintain a connection to Los Angeles.
"I don't feel that I'm leaving this place or that it will be goodbye forever," he said. "All the time I have spent here and all the experience that I have built here, I will bring to New York to build something new. This is life. I don't feel that it's an end."

Is He New York's New Bernstein?: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The superstar conductor's hiring is the New York Philharmonic's attempt to recapture the populist glamour it enjoyed under Leonard Bernstein in the 1960s.
Gustavo Dudamel becoming the New York Philharmonic's next conductor is a seismic event for the city's cultural scene.
Gifted and energetic, Dudamel, 42, is the rare classical artist to break into the mainstream. He has made albums with the world's top orchestras -- and voiced an animated character in "Trolls World Tour." He is the music director of the venerable Paris Opera -- and inspired the wild-haired maestro protagonist of the Amazon series "Mozart in the Jungle." He can shuttle between a Mahler symphony and a "Star Wars" soundtrack, between a John Adams premiere and a Super Bowl halftime show.
So New York hiring Dudamel is a huge coup, promising full houses and the devotion of donors. But his being poached from the Los Angeles Philharmonic -- for a five-year contract beginning with the 2026-27 season -- was also entirely predictable.
Over the past six years, New York's Philharmonic has been remodeling itself after Los Angeles's, the most ambitious and progressive major orchestra of the 21st century. In 2017, New York stole away Los Angeles's chief executive, Deborah Borda, who brought Dudamel to California when he was a 20-something wunderkind.
Borda gave New York's programming an L.A.-style, contemporary-minded face-lift. She helped complete a long-delayed renovation of David Geffen Hall that made the space more intimate and congenial -- and conspicuously similar to Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles.
Top executive, check. Programming, check. Hall, check. It was only a matter of time before Dudamel came on board -- famous conductor, check -- for what has swiftly become the Los Angeles Philharmonic East.
But if he is the final step in the Californiafication of Geffen Hall, he is also the fulfillment (or the attempt at one) of the New York Philharmonic's slower burning, less openly acknowledged longing: to recapture the populist glamour it enjoyed under Leonard Bernstein, its music director from 1958 to 1969.
Since then, through the ups and downs of six successors, there has been a palpable sense that the Philharmonic essentially wants a repeat of the Bernstein of the 1960s, when he was not just one of America's best known musicians, but also one of its best known figures, period.
Bernstein was a best-selling author who used his network-TV platform to render newly accessible the intricacies of Beethoven's Fifth, sonata form and jazz, and who had composed, with "West Side Story," a Broadway and Hollywood sensation. Friendly with the Kennedys, Lauren Bacall and Alice B. Toklas, he was as familiar from the society pages as from the arts section.
The mists of memory have erased some smudges. Critics sniped at his over-the-top emotiveness on the podium and at his long breaks between appearances with the orchestra. Not every piece he touched turned to gold.
But whatever actually happened, the Philharmonic quickly came to perceive his as the true glory days of the nation's oldest orchestra, which was founded in 1842 and has included luminaries like Mahler and Toscanini among its directors. With Bernstein conducting, its opening concert at its new Lincoln Center home in 1962, broadcast on CBS, was the top-rated show in its time slot that night. So enthusiastic were audiences that even when Bernstein took a sabbatical in the 1964-65 season, sold-out performances persisted.
The decades since have hardly been unmitigated failures. Pierre Boulez -- like Bernstein, a composer, though in a more recondite modernist mode -- innovated with repertory mixtures and concert formats. Zubin Mehta had easy charisma; Kurt Masur, old-world gravitas; Lorin Maazel, analytic brilliance; Alan Gilbert, D.I.Y.-style modesty; Jaap van Zweden, driven precision.
But the post-Bernstein years -- even Mehta's 13-year run, the orchestra's longest-ever directorship -- come across in many tellings as a bit of an anticlimax. Not since Lenny, the story goes, has the fit been exactly right, either in terms of the music-making or the whole romanticized feeling of being in the middle of it all, hitched to an actual star.
Until now?
For all the warmth he inspires in musicians, Dudamel isn't Bernstein. Talented and charming, he isn't a public communicator like Bernstein was. His fame, befitting our era, is about his vigor and visual silhouette -- that popcorn halo of curls -- more than his ability to articulate the meaning of Mahler in words for a mass audience.
And we now live a very different time than the '60s, for culture in general and classical music in particular. The recording industry is a shadow of the giant that created and promoted over 200 of Bernstein's incendiary, soulful collaborations with the Philharmonic. The orchestra now barely makes PBS, let alone CBS. The globe-trotting tours during which Bernstein was greeted like a liberating hero have been sharply curtailed.
And Dudamel's conducting can be uneven. His cycle of Schumann symphonies with the Philharmonic last season was spirited and unpretentious, naturally unfolding and fresh, more than deep or intense. Dvorak's "New World" Symphony, in 2020, was full of underlinings and italicizations, the work of a young man intent on making his presence known in a standard.
But even if he doesn't lecture on Mahler in prime time, his Mahler can be excellent, as in his strong, sincere Ninth Symphony recording with Los Angeles, from 2012. (In May, the Ninth will fill his first performances with the New York Philharmonic since his hiring.) While Dudamel is not a composer like Bernstein, his commitment to education and his advocacy for new music -- both pillars for Borda and her team in California -- have been as unfaltering as his great predecessor's. Both men managed to connect with audiences long schooled to think that only Europeans could have authority in the classics.
Dudamel is altogether as close a figure to Bernstein as any conductor in the world today, with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame to go with the capacity crowds at the Hollywood Bowl. Like Bernstein, he has achieved genuine civic stature -- and like Bernstein, enough of one to occasionally enmesh him in controversy. Dudamel was sharply criticized for continuing to work in his native Venezuela as humanitarian crises mounted under its president, Nicolás Maduro; under pressure, he spoke out against the Venezuelan government in 2017.
There were other options New York could have pursued -- acclaimed podium leaders even further from being household names. Santtu-Matias Rouvali, a few years younger than Dudamel, has had considerable success with the Philharmonic, as have more established hands like Manfred Honeck and Susanna Mälkki.
But there has long been, in this orchestra's music director choices, a sense of a pendulum swinging, each maestro the greatest possible contrast to the one before -- a key sign of an organization always looking for a singular savior, an answer to the problem of the moment, rather than making leadership decisions that emanate from sustained core values.
So it makes perfect sense that Dudamel, a superstar, would be the choice after van Zweden, a minor character even within the music industry. Van Zweden, in turn, was a martinet specialist in the standards who seemed appealing as an about-face from Gilbert, less electric in the core repertory. Gilbert's familial closeness to the Philharmonic -- both his parents were players -- was seen as the antidote to Maazel's remoteness. And so on, back to Bernstein. It's a recipe for short-term satisfaction, and short tenures.
It's also important to remember that Bernstein wasn't merely a star; he was a visionary. When he came back to the Philharmonic from that mid-60s sabbatical, for example, he announced that his programs over the next two years would be dominated by 20th-century works -- not short pieces, but substantial symphonies and concertos. That venture came from him, not from administrators whose marching orders he was executing.
So we'll see whether Dudamel just offers the easy sheen of celebrity, or whether he'll be connected organically to the orchestra, its growth and its city. He will certainly face challenges vastly more daunting than in Los Angeles, where that Philharmonic is the looming titan on the music scene. In New York, to the chagrin of conductor after conductor, you're competing with the world's greatest ensembles, constantly touring through Carnegie Hall with their best, most polished programs.
"A lot of us think," Zubin Mehta once said, "why not send our worst enemy to the New York Philharmonic and finish him off, once and for all."
Dudamel will immediately disrupt the city's cultural center of gravity -- including at Lincoln Center, where attention has long been weighted toward the mighty, publicity-grabbing Metropolitan Opera. For the Philharmonic, basking in robust attendance at its newly reopened hall as orchestras around the country are struggling, he offers the hope of further fending off a downturn. The question is whether he can fully break the New York music director curse for the first time since you-know-who.
When Bernstein announced he wouldn't extend his contract past 1969, he said, "I shall always regard the Philharmonic as 'my' orchestra." And in a way, it has been his ever since -- still in thrall to what he represented and the feelings he inspired, still seeking to recapture all that.
The Philharmonic is finally getting what it's wanted. Now we'll see what the orchestra does with it.

New York Hails Maestro as a ‘Monstro’ and a Boon to Young Musicians

Abstract: None available.

NEW YORK — Eduardo Cordova, a bartender at the Venezuelan restaurant Casa Ora in Brooklyn, greeted the naming of Gustavo Dudamel as the New York Philharmonic’s next music director and its first Hispanic leader with high praise.
“He’s a ‘monstro,’ ” Cordova said, speaking in Spanish and using a slang term that translates as “monster” in English but that had a different meaning in this context.
“Someone who has achieved a lot, a person who is talented,” said Cordova, who has lived in New York for six years and, like Dudamel, was born in Venezuela.
Susie Jaramillo, a children’s book author and CEO of the youth-oriented entertainment company Encantos, used the Spanish phrase “orgullo patrimonial,” or national pride, to describe her reaction to Dudamel’s hiring.
“To see him put our culture on such a pedestal, it’s incredible,” said Jaramillo, who was born in Caracas, Venezuela.
“The other thing about Dudamel,” she added, “is that he is an example of someone who went from nothing to everything, and there are so many Venezuelan kids coming into the country right now and need to see hope.”
Casa Ora’s owner, Ivo Diaz, expressed similar pride at hearing of his fellow Venezuelan’s prominent new post. Venezuela, Diaz said, is often portrayed in the media merely as the source of thousands of migrants who have come to the United States in recent years, and are now the focus of a contentious political debate.
“Every time we hear good news, it’s important,” Diaz said, speaking in Spanish. He added, “It’s like it’s always bad news, bad news. So it means the world to see good news and to see us represented well.”
Ismael Guevara is among those who made the arduous journey from Venezuela to the United States and, eventually, New York. Now housed at the city’s Brooklyn Cruise Terminal men’s shelter, Guevara was familiar with Dudamel and happy to hear about the next phase of his career.
“He’s really, really good, he’s very well-prepared,” Guevara said in Spanish, adding that “for me, it’s great, and it’s a source of pride.”
Ali Bello, a Venezuelan-born violinist who has long lived in New York and was trained in the country’s El Sistema music education program, which also produced Dudamel, said their shared foundation had surely helped his countryman reach such lofty heights.
“This is not luck,” Bello said. In addition to providing rigorous training in music, he noted, El Sistema emphasizes the importance of ensemble play and working with others in ways that carry well beyond the orchestra stage.
Learning from a young age that “we are only as good as we are, as a group” had meshed well with Dudamel’s superior musicianship, winning personality and powerful charisma to fuel his success, Bello said.
Members of New York’s Venezuelan diaspora were not the only ones who were excited by the announcement that Dudamel would soon take the Philharmonic’s helm.
The city is home to several youth music organizations with roots in the principles of social action through music that El Sistema promotes. Leaders of those groups said they believed Dudamel’s presence would be felt far beyond the orchestra’s Lincoln Center headquarters.
“I think there have been many missed opportunities to have a deep impact on music education across the city,” said Alvaro Rodas, an Ecuadorean-born percussionist and the founder and director of one such group, the Corona Youth Music Project in Queens. Based on Dudamel’s track record in Los Angeles, Rodas said, that seemed likely to change.
Anne Fitzgibbon, the founder and executive director of the Harmony Program, another organization that was inspired by El Sistema and provides after-school music education in schools that otherwise have limited access to it, said Dudamel’s move from Los Angeles would have a “seismic impact” on children like the ones her group works with.
“He has genuine commitment to promoting excellence as well as access to music education,” Fitzgibbon said.
Luigi Auquilla, who learned violin through the Harmony Program and is now a New York University junior studying political science, said he “couldn’t be more excited” about Dudamel joining the Philharmonic.
Auquilla, who had a chance to play under Dudamel’s direction at a festival in Mexico City in 2018, said he had been impressed at the way the conductor treated the young musicians: “the same way he would treat any other orchestra players.”
How did he expect Dudamel to use his new position to advance music education in New York?
“Spreading the love,” Auquilla said. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Irving's Nets Era Ends With Trade to Dallas: [Sports Desk]

Full text: Irving's tenure with the Nets was marred by his refusal to be vaccinated for the coronavirus and his posting of a link to an antisemitic film. In Dallas, he will join the superstar Luka Doncic.
Kyrie Irving is on his way out of Brooklyn after three and a half scandal-filled years in which the Nets fell way short of realizing their aspirations of seriously contending for an N.B.A. championship.
The Nets reached an agreement on Sunday to trade Irving to the Dallas Mavericks, according to three people familiar with the situation. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the trade had not yet been announced and they were not authorized to speak publicly about it.
The Nets were expected to receive Spencer Dinwiddie, 29, a guard who played five seasons with the Nets from 2016-21; forward Dorian-Finney Smith, 29; a first-round pick in 2029; and multiple second-round picks, two of the people said. The Mavericks will also receive the veteran forward Markieff Morris from the Nets, one of the people said.
The deal could help the Mavericks (28-26) rise enough in the tightly contested Western Conference to contend for a championship this season.
Irving, a dynamic point guard with a history of social activism, has also embraced controversy and conspiracy. He is in the final year of his contract with the Nets and had been hoping to work out a contract extension. With little progress on a deal, he asked the Nets to trade him last week, according to a person familiar with Irving's request who was not authorized to speak publicly about it.
On Jan. 26, Shetellia Riley Irving, his agent and stepmother, made public that his contract negotiations were not progressing.
"I have reached out to the Nets regarding this," she told Bleacher Report in January. "We have had no significant conversations to date. The desire is to make Brooklyn home, with the right type of extension, which means the ball is in the Nets' court to communicate now if their desire is the same."
Irving and the star forward Kevin Durant signed with the Nets as free agents in 2019, hoping their talent could help lead the Nets to an N.B.A. championship. But Irving's time with the Nets was tumultuous. He played in only 143 of the Nets' 278 regular-season games while on their roster.
When the two players signed with the Nets, Durant was still recovering from rupturing an Achilles' tendon in the 2019 N.B.A. finals with Golden State. Durant then missed the entire 2019-20 season. After having an operation on his right shoulder, Irving missed the end of that season, which the N.B.A. ended in a so-called bubble on the Walt Disney World campus in Florida because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The Nets lost a first-round series in the 2020 playoffs. In 2021, they lost an Eastern Conference semifinal series to the eventual champion Milwaukee Bucks in seven games.
Last season, Irving played in only 29 of the Nets' 82 games because he would not get vaccinated against the coronavirus despite New York City's vaccine requirement for private sector employees. The Nets initially said they would not allow Irving to play for them at all while he was ineligible for home games. But in January 2021, they changed course and allowed him to join the team on the road.
Irving's stance irritated a teammate, the star guard James Harden, who joked that he would vaccinate Irving himself, but then asked for a trade. Harden was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers in February 2022 for Ben Simmons, who did not play for the rest of that season because of his mental and physical health.
The Nets were swept by the Boston Celtics, the eventual conference champions, in the first round of the 2022 playoffs.
After that series, Irving and Durant flirted with leaving the organization. Irving was given the opportunity to find a trade partner, but ultimately he opted into the final year of his contract. Last June, Durant asked for a trade, but the Nets did not find a trade they thought suited them.
Despite having Simmons, Durant and Irving all available for the start of this season, the Nets lost six of their first eight games.
During that time, Irving posted a link to an antisemitic film on his social media accounts. A reporter from Rolling Stone wrote that the film's message centered on antisemitic tropes, and Irving was in trouble again. Irving faced backlash from Jewish leaders and the Nets owner Joe Tsai, who said on Twitter that he was disappointed Irving had linked to the movie and wanted to sit down with him so that he understood the hurt he had caused.
In a news conference in late October, Irving defended posting the film. The Nets kept Irving away from reporters for the next two games, and on Nov. 2 he released a statement with the Anti-Defamation League saying he would donate $ 500,000 to anti-hate causes.
But the next day, Irving addressed reporters after a practice and refused to apologize for posting the film or to disavow antisemitism.
The Nets suspended Irving later that day and said the suspension would last at least five games. He missed eight games and was allowed to return to the team after he apologized. Around that time, on Nov. 1, the Nets fired Steve Nash, who had been their head coach since September 2020, and hired Jacque Vaughn, who had been Nash's assistant.
When Irving has played, he has shown his value on the court. He has averaged 27.2 points per game since his return, and the Nets have gone 22-10 with him in the lineup since then. The Nets (32-20) are fourth in the Eastern Conference. Durant has missed the Nets' past 12 games with a knee injury. The Nets have gone 5-7 without him.
On Saturday, a day after Irving requested the trade, the Nets sat Irving with what they said was a calf injury. Still, the Nets notched a thrilling 125-123 victory over the Washington Wizards with 44 points from a reserve player, Cam Thomas.
The Athletic was first to report Irving's agreement with Dallas on Sunday. He is leaving one superstar in Durant to join another in the Mavericks' Luka Doncic. A 6-foot-7 guard, Doncic, 23, has been named an N.B.A. All-Star four times and was the league's rookie of the year in 2019.
Doncic played better at the beginning of this season than he had at the start of any of his previous seasons. His 33.4 points per game average ranked second in the league behind Philadelphia's Joel Embiid entering Sunday. Doncic has not yet averaged more than 30 points per game in a complete season.
In December against the Knicks, Doncic became the first player in N.B.A. history to score 60 points with 20 rebounds and 10 assists in one game. Earlier this season, he averaged 40.2 points per game during a 10-game stretch.
Despite Doncic's play, the Mavericks have struggled. They lacked enough depth to contend with injuries to key players. Maxi Kleber, a forward and center, had surgery on his hamstring in December. Christian Wood, who is also a frontcourt player, has missed the Mavericks' last eight games with a fractured thumb.
Dallas has won four of its last 11 games. The Mavericks are in sixth place in the Western Conference, but had only one fewer win than the third-place Sacramento Kings entering Sunday.

Full text: Poppy Liu plays a blackjack dealer in "Hacks." And has been working nonstop ever since.
Name: Poppy Liu
Age: 32
Hometown: Xi'an, China
Now Lives: In a one-bedroom ranch-style home on the East Side of Los Angeles with their partner, Jonah Tucker.
Claim to Fame: Poppy Liu is a first-generation Chinese American actor who plays Kiki, a sassy private blackjack dealer in the HBO series "Hacks." Although Ms. Liu's characters do not always identify as nonbinary or queer, "if they cast me in it, I'm like, 'Well, this character is a little bit queer now,"' said Ms. Liu, who uses "they" for a pronoun. "I think the essence of who you are is always present, and I really embrace that." They are also a doula to women of color and transgender people, and founded Collective Sex, a queer production company dedicated to inclusive stories about sex and healing.
Big Break: After graduating from Colgate University in 2013, Ms. Liu moved to New York City and landed various roles in downtown theater. In 2019, a casting call for "Sunnyside," an immigration sitcom created by Kal Penn, led to the part of Mei Lin, a Chinese billionaire's daughter. "I didn't always see the stories that represent the people that I care about," they said. "So, having my first experience on this incredible show with this ensemble became like a mini family."
Latest Project: They recently played Mitzi, the spoiled daughter of a mafia boss, in the Hulu romantic thriller "Wedding Season." But Ms. Liu's focus has been on parenthood, after giving birth in December. "It happened really quickly, so I don't know if I even had time to get existential about it," they said.
Next Thing: Ms. Liu has a recurring role in Season 2 of "The Afterparty," a murder-mystery comedy on Apple TV+, as well as on "American Born Chinese," an action-comedy series on Disney+, in which they play Princess Iron Fan, "a celestial girlboss" who can be "emotionally manipulative." While it's hard to pick favorites, they are most excited about a role in "Dead Ringers," a drama series on Amazon Prime Video. The character "is different than anything else I've done," they said. "The whole tone of the show is quite dark, it's very broody."
Reproductive Fight: They serve on the board of the SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, a group in Atlanta, and has helped a Mandarin-speaking patient who had a complex pregnancy. "I came on as her doula but ended up being her primary translator at the hospital as well," they said.

This Is What It Looks Like to Try to Count America's Homeless Population: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: To fix a problem like homelessness in America, you need to know its scope. To do that, you need sheriffs, social workers, volunteers, flashlights and 10 days in January.
They go into the streets in search of data. Peeking behind dumpsters, shining flashlights under bridges, rustling a frosted tent to see if anyone was inside. This is what it takes to count the people in America who don't have a place to live. To get a number, however flawed, that describes the scope of a deeply entrenched problem and the country's progress toward fixing it.
Last year, the Biden administration laid out a goal to reduce homelessness by 25 percent by 2025. The problem increasingly animates local politics, with ambitious programs to build affordable housing getting opposition from homeowners who say they want encampments gone but for the solution to be far from their communities. Across the country, homelessness is a subject in which declarations of urgency outweigh measurable progress.
Officially called the Point-in-Time Count, the annual tally of those who live outside or in homeless shelters takes place in every corner of the country through the last 10 days of January, and over the past dozen years has found 550,000 to 650,000 people experiencing homelessness. The endeavor is far from perfect, advocates note, since it captures no more than a few days and is almost certainly a significant undercount. But it's a snapshot from which resources flow, and creates a shared understanding of a common problem.
This year, reporters and photographers from The New York Times shadowed the count, using a sampling of four very different communities -- warm and cold, big and small, rural and urban -- to examine the same problem in vastly different places.
On any given evening, the forces that drive someone to sleep outside or in a shelter are myriad and complex. A long-run erosion in wages. A fraying social safety net. The fact that hard drugs are cheap and mental health care is not. Year after year, the count finds people experiencing homelessness to be disproportionately Black, disproportionately old and disproportionately sick. Members of the L.G.B.T.Q. community are overrepresented as well.
There is one factor -- the high cost of housing and difficulty of finding anything affordable -- that rises above the rest. The numbers bear this out, explaining why expensive West Coast cities like Los Angeles have long had the nation's worst homeless problems, why growing cities like Phoenix are now seeing a troubling rise, and why it is seemingly easier to solve homelessness in places like Rockford, Ill., a once-thriving factory town that has lost a lot of jobs but where housing remains cheap.
"Housing has become a competition for a scarce resource, and when you have that the people who are most vulnerable are going to lose," Gregg Colburn, a professor at the University of Washington and a co-author of "Homelessness Is a Housing Problem," said in an interview.
The 2023 count will provide a crucial understanding of the legacy of the Covid-19 pandemic and the success of government efforts in blunting its effects. Last year's count -- 582,462 -- showed homelessness was essentially flat from two years ago, a fact that Jeff Olivet, executive director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, attributed to widespread eviction moratoriums, billions in rental assistance and an expansion of federal housing vouchers that fortified the safety net. The question for this year, Mr. Olivet said, is "whether we were able to flatten the curve and even start pointing downwards."
Behind each number are tens of thousands of volunteers, outreach workers and public safety officers who spend the wee hours looking for the most destitute members of their community.
Sometimes, people gladly answer questions and thank volunteers for what they are doing, with a hope that accurate figures will bring more funding for housing and services. Other times, they feel violated and gawked at.
"What are you doing?" a man on a bicycle in Los Angeles asked a team of volunteers in day glow vests as they walked past a downtown sidewalk covered in tents.
"Counting."
"Counting what?"
"Counting people."
-- Conor Dougherty
'Once you enter this whole cycle, you are always on the edge'
In the capital of the capital of homelessness, the people who live outside are used to seeing outsiders. This is especially true in Skid Row, a 50-block neighborhood in downtown where some 3,000 people live in the tents, shanties and recreational vehicles that so thoroughly clog the sidewalks that much of the pedestrian traffic is in the streets. So when dozens of volunteers in reflective vests left the Downtown Women's Center to count on a recent evening, the people they were counting rarely so much as looked up.
"They constantly have visitors, whether it's proselytizers, outreach teams, people offering them something to eat, people offering them drugs -- people doing a homeless count," said Suzette Shaw, a volunteer who helped with the tally this year. "This community never sleeps."
Ms. Shaw is a 58-year-old student who lives in the neighborhood and was once homeless herself. She lived in various forms of transitional housing -- hotels, shelters -- until she found a permanent subsidized unit in 2016, whose rent is partially covered with a Section 8 housing voucher. Joining the count is one way she tries to make sense of a neighborhood whose scenes of ragged fabric and open fires are some of the bleakest pictures America has to offer.
Given that it has the nation's worst homeless problem, Los Angeles's count requires assembling a small army that spends three days and several thousand hours amassing their figures. This ranges from volunteers like Ms. Shaw who comb sidewalks for a few hours, to officers like Lt. William Kitchin, of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, who along with a team of deputies and outreach workers spent a recent Wednesday driving a stretch of the Los Angeles River to tally the residents who live under overpasses and along the banks.
Unlike smaller cities, which often pair the Point-in-Time Count with interviews and outreach, for sensitivity and safety reasons organizers in Los Angeles discourage volunteers from interacting with the people on the streets.
Some walk, some drive, but for the most part it happens briskly and the numbers they come back with are large. According to last year's count, about 20 percent of the entire nation's unsheltered population -- about 50,000 people -- lived in Los Angeles County.
This has left voters despondent: Surveys consistently show housing and homelessness are the biggest concern of California voters, while a recent poll by the Los Angeles Business Council Institute found residents are furious at the city's inability to make so much as a dent, with many voters saying they feel unsafe and have considered moving because of the homeless problem.
After a campaign last year that focused almost entirely on homelessness, Karen Bass, the city's new mayor, declared a state of emergency on her first day in office. This gives her office expanded powers to speed the construction of affordable housing by lifting rules that impede it.
"Tonight we're counting the people on the street, but we also know that it is most important that we prevent new people from falling into homelessness," the mayor said to a crowd at a kickoff event in the San Fernando Valley. She joined the count shortly after, along with the actor Danny Trejo.
Ms. Bass summed up the central problem for Los Angeles and other high-cost U.S. cities: Even as they spend billions on new housing and expanded services, more people continue to fall into homelessness faster than these programs can help people already on the streets. Nationally, some 901,000 people exited homelessness each year between 2017 and 2020 on average. That figure would be a huge accomplishment, but for one detail: About 909,000 people entered homelessness each year over the same period.
"Once you enter this whole cycle, you are always on the edge," Ms. Shaw said.
'I stayed there till they kicked me out'
Daniel Greene never thought he would end up homeless in Phoenix, a city that enticed him from Idaho a decade ago with balmy winters and cheap housing. But when his lease was up for renewal in December, Mr. Greene said his landlord raised the monthly rent on his one-bedroom apartment to $ 1,400 from $ 700. Arizona has few restrictions on rent increases. Now, Mr. Greene is sleeping in a park while he tries to scrape together a deposit.
"I would need $ 4,000," he said on Tuesday morning, as a volunteer counted Mr. Greene as part of the city's portion of the annual Point-in-Time Count.
Mr. Greene, 54, is one of thousands of newly homeless people who have been coughed out of the tailpipe of Arizona's economic engine, casualties of growth that has drawn new factories and hundreds of thousands of new residents, while sending housing costs spiraling.
Advocates say Phoenix's streets are increasingly filled with people who simply could not afford an increasingly pricey Arizona: Average rent in the Phoenix area has risen by about 70 percent over the past five years, and the number of people in shelters or living on the street has gone up by 60 percent.
"The cost of housing is the biggest thing we see," said Kenn Weise, the mayor of the suburban city Avondale, Ariz., and chairman of the Maricopa Association of Governments, which runs the Point-in-Time Count.
The path that brought Mr. Greene to a park in downtown Phoenix, repairing a beater bicycle, began, he said, when he fell from a scaffold at his carpentry job a few years ago. Work was impossible after he crushed his leg, but he said he survived on monthly disability checks.
The rent on his apartment near the palms of Encanto Park crept up from $ 525 to $ 700 before doubling in December, part of the disappearance of modestly priced rentals around Phoenix. A decade ago, almost 90 percent of apartments around Phoenix rented for $ 1,000 or less. Now, just 10 percent do.
"I stayed there till they kicked me out," Mr. Greene said.
He shoved his furniture and most of his clothes into a $ 100 monthly storage unit and decided to live outside to try to rebuild his finances. A weekly motel might have been safer, but he figured the open air was free. He is camping out with three other men and spends a lot of time scouring roommate websites.
"I'm doing this on my own," he said.
As the first of nearly 1,000 volunteers crisscrossed downtown Phoenix starting before sunrise on Tuesday morning, they met people sleeping in makeshift tents beside new art spaces and camping out in the shadow of construction cranes.
One volunteer, Katie Gentry, regional homelessness program manager for the Maricopa Association of Governments, walked up to a gas station downtown where people had come to ask for quarters to buy coffee and escape from the chill; she approached them to ask a series of deeply personal questions with a matter-of-fact cheerfulness.
The Point-in-Time Count is part census, part deeply intimate personal history. Volunteers here ask for people's name, age and ethnicity, but also whether prison time, drug use or mental illness is a factor in their homelessness. One question asks whether people had ever traded sex for shelter.
Gustavo Martinez, 56, said he lost his job as a concessionaire for spring-training baseball games during the early days of the pandemic, and he lost his subleased apartment a few months later. He has been bouncing from friends' couches to shelter beds to living on the streets ever since. He said that he earned a little money cleaning up after the downtown Phoenix farmers market, and that he often spent his time marveling at how anyone could afford to live downtown in the new high-rises sprouting up around him.
"Everything is just going up and up and up."
'They were born there, raised there, and they have become homeless there'
One of Florida McKay's colleagues had passed on a tip: There was a woman living in a trailer without heat, light or water in Shelby, Miss., a little hamlet surrounded by the soybean and cotton fields north of town. On a cold and gray morning, Ms. McKay and Robert Lukes, who was helping to administer the Point-in-Time Count in the Mississippi Delta, drove past acres of mud-bogged farmland to find her.
"The Delta's a little different from other areas in terms of homelessness," said Ms. McKay, the director of homeless services for the Bolivar County Community Action Agency, a nonprofit organization. There are plenty of people in need here -- the median household income in Bolivar County is less than half of the nation's and the poverty rate is roughly triple -- but they are scattered across the region, making the Point-in-Time Count a sprawling exercise in detective work.
On a street corner in Shelby, they parked near a blue and white trailer sagging into the grass. A woman opened the tattered door, hugging herself in the cold, and welcomed Ms. McKay and Mr. Lukes inside. Blankets were stapled over the windows and a rusty propane tank squatted at the end of a bed.
Mr. Lukes began the questionnaire: name, age, how long had she been homeless. Vickey Wells, she said, born on Christmas Day, 1971. She had been living in this dark, cold room for most of a year. Asked how long she had been in the community, Ms. Wells seemed puzzled. She grew up down the street. "This is my home," she said.
Rural areas are different in terms of homelessness and the Delta is perhaps more different still. In this vast expanse of rural Mississippi, one of the poorest regions of the country, there are very few shelters, very few multifamily housing developments and, relative to the rest of the country, fewer places for rent.
It is a landscape of cropland and modest stand-alone homes, where families have lived -- or did live -- for generations. Some homes have been empty for years, left behind by a Great Migration of Black people out of the Delta that began early last century and has never really stopped.
In contrast to big cities, where those who are homeless are often people who have moved there in search of opportunities, many of the people without a place to stay in the Delta are those who have never left. In some cases they seek shelter in the homes left by those who went elsewhere.
"People in the Delta that are homeless are from the Delta," said Hannah Maharrey, the director of the Mississippi Balance of State Continuum of Care, a federally funded program to address homelessness. It's also the organization that Mr. Lukes works for. "They are literally homeless in their hometown. They lived there, they're from there, their roots are there, they were born there, raised there, and they have become homeless there."
Some have been kicked out by family or marooned after the death of a parent; some are escaping abuse; some have fallen prey to addiction in a place where the margin for error is virtually nonexistent. Some never left their homes at all, staying as the structures around them decayed and utilities were cut off, becoming homeless without ever moving.
Jobs in the Delta are scarce, government services are limited and the nonprofit infrastructure is thin, Ms. Maharrey said. The burden of helping the desperate falls largely to churches, neighbors and community groups.
The Point-in-Time Count relies on these local ranks and their network of sources -- court clerks, gas station attendants, motel owners, police officers, longtime contacts within the homeless community itself. On cold nights, those seeking shelter find sanctuary anywhere they can, in cars, abandoned homes and vacant strip malls. The only way to really know who is staying where is to live in these communities and know the people firsthand.
The fact that the rural homeless population is harder to see is what makes the yearly census so important, Ms. Maharrey said. "When I talk to other communities, they find it difficult to believe that there's homelessness in rural Mississippi, or that there's homelessness in rural America," she said. "The Point-in-Time Count gives us a reference point."
In Greenwood, Miss., population around 14,000, the team drove into a wooded lot where Donjua Parris, 43, had been living with her partner since the summer. Four years ago, her partner lost his maintenance job at the apartment building where they lived, she said, and when they were evicted, her family wouldn't take them in. Ms. Lukes ran through the census questions with Ms. Parris, who shivered in the cold, then he asked her where they should go to find others.
"There is a place," she said, gesturing toward an area on the riverside of a nearby levee, where she said a pregnant woman was living. "She needs help."
A few minutes later, Mr. Lukes had climbed down the levee and found a campsite abandoned. If the woman had been there, she was gone now.
'Right now, I don't got to worry anymore'
Empty bridges, empty alleys, an empty shanty behind a strip mall parking lot. Angie Walker ticked off a list of where people have been known to sleep. Outside, it was in the mid-20s with a light layer of snow upholstered on fences and grass.
"Our hope is that nobody is outside," said Ms. Walker, who oversees the homeless program for Rockford's Health and Human Services Department. "We don't usually get that lucky."
They did not, but they were close. After a three-hour search in a Chevy Suburban that at times went off-road and on bike paths, Ms. Walker and her team, which included a retired police officer and a member of the Fire Department, found only one person -- a shivering man in a tent who clasped his hands as she ran through a list of survey questions -- on the night of Rockford's count.
As Ms. Walker had predicted earlier in the evening, most of the night's numbers consisted of the three-dozen people who laid on rectangles of padding parceled across a gym floor at Second First Church. On winter nights, the church becomes a warming center, providing a captive audience for Ms. Walker and the dozen others who spent an hour counting bodies and performing surveys after the drive.
"Right now, I don't got to worry anymore," said Shirley Gill, a 63-year-old who was in for the evening.
Not having to worry anymore: That is the goal of the tens of billions that city, state and federal governments spend each year in their so far futile effort to end homelessness.
Rockford is one of the country's biggest success stories, having effectively ended the condition for veterans and chronically homeless individuals, or those who have experienced homelessness for at least a year, who have severe addiction problems or live with a disability of some kind.
The road to those accomplishments was a program called "Built for Zero," a coalition of 105 local governments nationwide whose members commit to reorganizing their social services and gathering monthly data with a goal of drastically reducing their homeless population. (In 2021, Community Solutions, the New York nonprofit that created "Built for Zero," was awarded a $ 100 million grant from the MacArthur Foundation to expand the program.)
Central to the work is a concept called "functional zero," or the point at which the number of people going into and out of homelessness is equal each month, and anyone who experiences it isn't homeless for more than a few weeks. This does not mean no one will ever be seen sleeping on the streets: Community Solutions instead likens its strategy to a hospital that can take care of everyone who shows up, even if the medical staff can't prevent them from getting sick.
"Before we get to a place where no one ever has to experience homelessness, we need some milestone that shows we have a system that can be responsive," said Beth Sandor, chief program officer at Community Solutions.
Back at the warming center on the night of the count, Douglas Webb, a 54-year-old Marine Corps veteran, provided an example of good news. The first time Mr. Webb visited the warming center at Second First, he said, was after an outreach worker found him under a mass of blankets in a parking garage. Now he works at the warming center in the winter.
"I was able to pull myself out of it," he said.
Mr. Webb is part of what is perhaps the most encouraging story in homelessness. Measured by the Point-in-Time Count, homelessness among veterans nationwide has plunged 55 percent since 2010, as the federal government has poured money into housing and support programs for them.
Mr. Webb noted that he paid $ 620 for a one-bedroom apartment, low by national standards. (Rockford's rents are about half the national level, according to a rental index compiled by Zillow.) This is a reflection of the city's economic malaise. In the hours before the count, Ms. Walker gave a brief tour of Rockford, with sights that included an abandoned factory that used to provide good paying jobs, the anchor storefront that used to be a Kmart, the boarded-up school where people sometimes live.
The city of 147,000 is a picture of Rust Belt decline, with problems that are a magnification of the country's stratifying economy: Over the past several decades, its base of middle-class manufacturing jobs has withered and been replaced by low-wage retail work, creating a cycle of poverty, despair and crime.
As Ms. Walker surveyed a deserted encampment made with tarps and PVC piping, she noted that some of the city's success in fighting homelessness could be attributed to its decline. In other words, because there's been so much disinvestment, Rockford's housing is cheaper and more plentiful than elsewhere. And such is the irony of homelessness: Economically speaking, it's easier to solve it in places where things are going poorly than where things are going well.

Name: Poppy Liu
Age: 32
Hometown: Xi’an, China
Now Lives: In a three-bedroom ranch-style home on the East Side of Los Angeles with their partner, Jonah Tucker.
Claim to Fame: Poppy Liu is a first-generation Chinese American actor who plays Kiki, a sassy private blackjack dealer in the HBO series “Hacks.” Although Liu’s characters do not always identify as nonbinary or queer, “if they cast me in it, I’m like, ‘Well, this character is a little bit queer now,’” said Lui, who uses “they” for a pronoun. “I think the essence of who you are is always present, and I really embrace that.” They are also a doula to women of color and transgender people, and founded Collective Sex, a queer production company dedicated to inclusive stories about sex and healing.
Big Break: After graduating from Colgate University in 2009, Liu moved to New York City and landed various roles in downtown theater. In 2019, a casting call for “Sunnyside,” an immigration sitcom created by Kal Penn, led to the part of Mei Lin, a Chinese billionaire’s daughter. “I didn’t always see the stories that represent the people that I care about,” they said. “So, having my first experience on this incredible show with this ensemble became like a mini family.”
Latest Project: They recently played Mitzi, the spoiled daughter of a mafia boss, in the Hulu romantic thriller “Wedding Season.” But Liu’s focus has been on parenthood, after giving birth in December. “It happened really quickly, so I don’t know if I even had time to get existential about it,” they said.
Next Thing: Liu has a recurring role in Season 2 of “The Afterparty,” a murder-mystery comedy on Apple TV+, as well as on “American Born Chinese,” an action-comedy series on Disney+, in which they play Princess Iron Fan, “a celestial girlboss” who can be “emotionally manipulative.” While it’s hard to pick favorites, they are most excited about a role in “Dead Ringers,” a drama series on Amazon Prime Video. The character “is different than anything else I’ve done,” they said. “The whole tone of the show is quite dark, it’s very broody.”
Reproductive Fight: They serve on the board of the SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, a group in Atlanta, and has helped a Mandarin-speaking patient who had a complex pregnancy. “I came on as her doula but ended up being her primary translator at the hospital as well,” they said.

Warner Bros. Long-Term Plan Relies on Superman's Powers: [Correction]

Full text: The yet-to-be-cast "Superman: Legacy" will begin a story that unfolds across at least 10 interconnected movies and TV shows, with Batman, Swamp Thing and others.
Superman is returning to theaters -- only now, along with saving the world, he has to prove that Warner Bros. has finally, without question, it means it this time, found a winning superhero strategy.
DC Studios, a newly formed Warner division dedicated to superhero content, unveiled plans on Tuesday to reboot Superman onscreen for the first time in a generation, tentatively scheduling the yet-to-be-cast "Superman: Legacy" for release in theaters in July 2025. James Gunn, known for "Guardians of the Galaxy," is writing the screenplay and may also direct the movie, which will focus on Superman balancing his Kryptonian heritage with his human upbringing.
"He is kindness in a world that thinks of kindness as old-fashioned," said Peter Safran, chief executive of DC Studios, a title he shares with Mr. Gunn.
Moreover, "Superman: Legacy" will begin a story that will unfold (Marvel style) across at least 10 interconnected movies and TV shows and include new versions of Batman, Robin, Supergirl, Swamp Thing and Green Lantern. Those marquee DC Comics characters will be joined by lesser-known personalities from the DC library, including Creature Commandos and Booster Gold, a time traveler. One of the shows will explore Themyscira, the mythical island home of Wonder Woman.
The 10 projects will roll out over four to five years -- at which time a second batch of related films and shows will be announced, expanding the "Superman: Legacy" saga to nearly a decade and perhaps helping David Zaslav, the chief executive of Warner Bros. Discovery, to keep a promise to Wall Street about growth.
"Part of our strategy is drive the hell out of DC," Mr. Zaslav said at an RBC Capital Markets event in November. Discovery took over Warner Bros. last year as part of a $ 43 billion merger.
If it all comes to fruition, the "Superman: Legacy" universe of projects will add to a roster of unrelated superhero movies left over from a previous Warner Bros. administration. These movies, sequels all, include "Shazam! Fury of the Gods," "The Flash," "Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom," "Joker: Folie à Deux" and "The Batman -- Part II."
Warner Bros. and DC Comics became part of the same conglomerate in 1969, and the studio has since used DC characters to make more than 40 movies and at least 30 television shows, including cartoons. But the DC library has been widely viewed on Wall Street as underexploited because a competing comics-to-screens company, the Disney-owned Marvel, has provided an example of what is possible.
Over the last 10 years, Marvel has been a blockbuster machine, delivering slates of interconnected superhero movies that have collected $ 23 billion at the global box office. Movies based on DC characters and released by Warner Bros. have generated about $ 9 billion over that period.
Suffice it to say, Warner Bros., which invented the big-budget superhero movie in 1978 with "Superman," has been under pressure to get its act together. In a restructuring in October, Mr. Zaslav ended the studio's decentralized approach to superhero management -- separate film and television divisions developed material independently, sometimes causing friction -- and put Mr. Gunn and Mr. Safran in charge of superhero films, series and animated offerings.
"The stakes are massive for us, and for Warner Bros. Discovery," Mr. Safran said.
Mr. Gunn called Warner's old system "pretty messed up."
"Nobody was minding the mint," he added. "They were just giving away I.P. like they were party favors to any creator who smiled at them."
Superhero movies remain reliably popular at the box office, but a glut of them has prompted worries that studios are wearing out the audience.
"I think it's real," Mr. Gunn said, referring to superhero fatigue. "You have to make the stories diverse and different. Good guy, bad guy, giant thing in the sky, good guys win -- you can't tell that story again. You need to tell stories that are more, you know, morally complex."

Cindy Williams, the Hopeful Half Of 'Laverne & Shirley,' Dies at 75: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: From 1976 to 1983, she (Shirley) and Penny Marshall (Laverne) drew millions of viewers to a sitcom playing roommates who worked in a Milwaukee brewery.
Cindy Williams, an actress best known for her role on the long-running sitcom "Laverne & Shirley," died on Wednesday in Los Angeles. She was 75.
Her assistant, Liza Cranis, confirmed the death on Monday, saying it came after a brief illness. No specific cause was given.
"Laverne & Shirley," which ran on ABC from 1976 to 1983, starred Ms. Williams and Penny Marshall as two young single women working at a Milwaukee brewery in the 1950s. Ms. Williams played Shirley Feeney, an upbeat and demure complement to Ms. Marshall's brash Laverne DeFazio. The show was a spinoff of the hugely popular sitcom "Happy Days."
For several years "Laverne & Shirley" was among the highest-rated shows in the country. Ms. Williams appeared in more than 150 episodes but left early in the eighth and final season after considerable on-set tension between her and Ms. Marshall. Ms. Marshall died in 2018, also at age 75.
Ms. Williams is survived by her children, Emily and Zak Hudson. Her marriage to the musician Bill Hudson ended in divorce.
Before Ms. Williams landed the role that would most define her career, she was cast in the George Lucas film "American Graffiti," a 1973 coming-of-age story about a group of California teenagers. Ms. Williams played Laurie, the girlfriend of one of the film's other main characters (played by Ron Howard), a portrayal that earned her a best supporting actress nomination from the British Academy Film Awards.
The next year she was in the Francis Ford Coppola film "The Conversation." "American Graffiti" (which was produced by Mr. Coppola) and "The Conversation" garnered best picture nominations at the Academy Awards.
Ms. Williams auditioned for the role of Princess Leia in the original "Star Wars" movie, also directed by Mr. Lucas, a part that went to Carrie Fisher.
Later in her career, she was a guest star on well-known television shows like "Law and Order: SVU" and "7th Heaven" and earned several stage credits, including a brief stint in 2007 in the Broadway production of the musical "The Drowsy Chaperone." But she was best known as Shirley.
"She was sort of an optimist, kindhearted, repressed, temperamental, fun-loving person," Ms. Williams once said of her character. "I always saw her as having this fear," she added, noting that while Shirley's desires were never explicitly played out onscreen, both Laverne and Shirley strove for the comforts of modern life.
"That was the sadness of those characters to me," Ms. Williams added. "What if that never happens, then where are we? And that was sort of my life, too."
Cynthia Jane Williams was born on Aug. 22, 1947, in Van Nuys, a neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, to Beachard and Frances Williams. She became interested in acting during high school and attended Los Angeles City College, where she majored in theater arts. "I'm what you might call a 'Valley Girl,"' Ms. Williams wrote in her 2015 memoir, "Shirley, I Jest! A Storied Life."
Before going into show business, she worked at a pancake house and the Whisky a Go Go nightclub in Hollywood. She went on to perform in commercials for deodorant and sunglasses, some of which never aired, she said in an interview with the Television Academy. Her early television roles included parts on the high school comedy-drama "Room 222," the sitcom "Nanny and the Professor" and the anthology comedy series "Love, American Style."
"I always played the lead's best friend, always," she said.
Known at the time for her seemingly guileless American sweetheart presence, Ms. Williams turned that expectation inside out with a sly performance in "The Conversation." In that film, the viewer pieces together her words from a surreptitiously recorded conversation, expecting her to be a helpless victim and not as someone in control of her own fate, as she actually is. More dramatic roles might have followed, but she turned to situation comedy.
Ms. Williams and Ms. Marshall were writing partners at Zoetrope, a production company founded by Mr. Coppola, where they were working on a prospective TV spoof for the bicentennial, when the producer and director Garry Marshall, Ms. Marshall's brother, asked if the two women would guest star on his show "Happy Days" as dates for Fonzie (Henry Winkler) and Richie (Ron Howard). Fonzie claimed Laverne for himself, while Shirley was meant for Richie, reuniting Ms. Williams with her "American Graffiti" co-star.
That episode of "Happy Days," which aired in 1975, was so popular that Mr. Marshall pitched Fred Silverman, a top executive at ABC, on a comedy starring the two, arguing that there were no other shows about blue-collar women.
The opening credits of "Laverne & Shirley" featured a school rhyme and a heartwarming mission statement that summed up the duo's playful, hopeful ethic: They might just be young working-class women in the big city, but they are going to make their dreams come true.
Laverne and Shirley's high jinks were reminiscent of those of Lucy Ricardo and Ethel Mertz on "I Love Lucy," but in this comedy pairing, Shirley was (usually) the calmer and dreamier of the two. With her breezy personality, Ms. Williams demonstrated a flair for portraying the awkwardness of youth in broad physical comedy.
In a review of "Laverne & Shirley" in 1976, John J. O'Connor of The New York Times wrote: "Both title roles are played to a splendid noncondescending turn. Miss Williams and Miss Marshall touch all the best bases, a bit of Barbara Stanwyck in 'Stella Dallas' here, a bit of Giùlietta Masina in 'La Strada' there, touches of Lucille Ball, Eve Arden and that crowd all over the place."
Though the actresses shared the screen, Ms. Williams sometimes felt that her co-star got preferential treatment because of her familial connection to Mr. Marshall. For her part, Ms. Marshall felt that Ms. Williams's husband at the time, Mr. Hudson, who wanted to be a producer, was making too many demands on the production to accommodate his wife's pregnancy.
At the beginning of the show's final season, viewers watched Ms. Williams marry a man named Walter Meeney (and become Shirley Feeney Meeney). Soon afterward, however, her long run came to an ignominious end, with the plot claiming that Shirley had followed her new husband overseas, leaving only a note to say goodbye. In reality, Ms. Williams had hoped to work with the show to hide and accommodate her pregnancy. She later sued for $ 20 million; the case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.
"'Laverne & Shirley' ended abruptly for me," Ms. Williams wrote in her memoir. "When we shot the first episode, I was four months pregnant. But when it came time to sign the contract for that season I realized that the studio had scheduled me to work on my delivery due date."
"In the wink of an eye, I found myself off the show," she continued. "It was so abrupt that I didn't even have time to gather my personal things."
In 2013, Ms. Williams and Ms. Marshall reunited for an appearance on the Nickelodeon series "Sam & Cat," a modern show that riffed on the themes of "Laverne & Shirley" and starred Jennette McCurdy and Ariana Grande.
Last year, Ms. Williams completed a national theater tour of a one-woman show, "Me, Myself and Shirley," in which she chronicled her life in Hollywood as well as her relationship with Ms. Marshall.
"You couldn't slip a playing card in between us because we just were in rhythm," she said last year in an interview with NBC. "I couldn't have done it with anyone else."

Gen X Nostalgia Gets a Sing-Along: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The educational snippets are the ultimate font of Gen X nostalgia. But what is it we're nostalgic for?
When I was in second grade, my teacher held a contest: The first students to memorize their multiplication tables would get dinner at McDonald's. I was one of them. I'd like to credit hard work or the motivation of those golden fries, but in truth it was easy. I learned it from "Schoolhouse Rock."
It was not the last time that watching too much TV would pay off for me, but it was perhaps the sweetest.
If you were an American kid around when I was (nineteen-seventy-cough), you probably have "Schoolhouse Rock" hard-wired into your brain too. The musical shorts, which began airing on ABC in 1973, taught Generation X multiplication, grammar, history and, eventually, nostalgia.
That last lesson stuck best. Winona Ryder and company crooned "Conjunction Junction" and "I'm Just a Bill" in the 1994 generational-statement film "Reality Bites." De La Soul borrowed "Three Is a Magic Number" as the backbone for their buoyant self-introduction, "The Magic Number," in 1989. Nostalgia for "Schoolhouse Rock" is now itself old enough to be nostalgic for.
On Wednesday, ABC will tap into that spirit with a prime time "50th Anniversary Singalong," in which the Black Eyed Peas, the Muppets, Shaquille O'Neal and others will hook up the words, phrases and clauses of the Saturday-morning favorites.
The special promises wholesome family fun, and I can think of worse things to do on a weeknight than musically unpacking my adjectives in the judgment-free zone of my living room. But nostalgia is not just a fun emotion. Like some of the best "Schoolhouse Rock" songs, it carries a note of wistfulness.
In this case, it's a reminder of a time when network TV gave us a common culture, language and lyrics, before we were sliced into subcultures and demographics. Pre-internet, pre-cable, pre-DVD -- pre-VHS, even -- "Schoolhouse Rock" convened a classroom of millions for three-minute servings of revolutionary art alongside installments of "The Great Grape Ape Show."
Like much classic kids' TV, "Schoolhouse Rock" was brought to you by Madison Avenue. The ad executive David McCall, who noticed that his son could memorize pop songs but struggled with arithmetic, suggested to George Newall, a creative director, and Thomas Yohe, an art director, that they figure out how to set math to music.
As Newell told the Times in 1994, they pitched the idea to Michael Eisner, then the director of children's programming at ABC, who happened to be meeting with the legendary Looney Tunes animator Chuck Jones. "I think you should buy it right away," Jones said.
Unlike the dutiful news interstitials that vitamin-fortified other Saturday-morning cartoon lineups, "Schoolhouse Rock" harnessed the power of comedy and ear worms. The facts and figures made it educational. But they weren't what made it art.
That was the animation, psychedelically colorful and chock-full of rapid-fire slapstick gags. Above all, there was the sophisticated music. The jazz composer Bob Dorough wrote the banger-filled first season, "Multiplication Rock," surveying a range of styles from the duodecimal prog-rock of "Little Twelvetoes" to the spiraling lullaby of "Figure Eight."
The lyrics were sly and funny but could also detour, like a fidgety schoolkid sitting by the window, into daydreams. The blissful "Three Is a Magic Number" isn't just a primer on multiples; it's a rumination on the triad foundations of the universe, from geometry to love. (If your voice does not break singing, "A man and a woman had a little baby," you're doing something wrong.)
The following seasons, about grammar, American history and science, added other contributors, including Lynn Ahrens, the future Broadway songwriter thanks to whom an entire generation cannot recite the preamble to the Constitution without breaking into song.
The words and numbers in "Schoolhouse Rock" were never just words and numbers. Like the early years of "Sesame Street," the shorts had an anarchic spirit and a pluralistic sensibility. "I Got Six" is a funk explosion whose Afrocentric animation includes a dashiki-ed African prince with six rings on all 10 fingers. "Verb: That's What's Happening" -- imagine if Curtis Mayfield taught your English class -- depicts a Black superhero long before Black Panther made it to the movie screen.
When my kids were school-aged, I got the full "Schoolhouse Rock" DVD set for them, which is to say, I got it for me. (You can now stream the '70s seasons, plus a brief 1980s series about computers and a clunky 1990s revival, "Money Rock," through Disney+.)
Rewatching the series taught me about a new subject: Time.
The songs are as catchy as ever. But to screen "Schoolhouse Rock" as an adult is to visit a different period in cultural history, and not just because of the bell-bottoms. The America of "Schoolhouse Rock" was divided by Vietnam and Watergate, but it could at least subscribe to basic common facts and civic principles.
Consider Bill, the underdog paper hero of "I'm Just a Bill," longing to become a law that would keep that cartoon school bus safe at railroad crossings. Now he's a time traveler, from a pre-Reagan age when government activism, however imperfect, was considered a force for good.
Today, with culture-warring politicians like the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, red-penciling school curriculums, weaponizing pronouns and hammering history teachers for "indoctrination," the potential land mines add up. "The Great American Melting Pot" did not imagine a future president telling asylum seekers, "Our country is full." When "Interjections" depicted a doctor giving a child a shot, it did not anticipate legislators denouncing Big Bird for advocating childhood vaccination.
(Likewise, when "Elementary, My Dear" taught counting by twos with a gospel-style Noah's Ark song, it didn't fear repercussions for bringing religion into kids' TV.)
And that's before you even get to "Science Rock." "The Energy Blues" makes a matter-of-fact pitch for conservation that would cause smoke eruptions today. (In 2009, a climate-focused season, "Earth Rock" went straight to DVD.) When "Schoolhouse Rock" showed kids a three-minute video on how the body worked, there was no internet algorithm to suggest a rebuttal by someone who "did his own research."
That said, I wouldn't romanticize the "Schoolhouse Rock" era as a paradise of educational consensus. In 1974, the year before the "America Rock" season began, protesters against desegregation in Boston threw rocks at buses carrying Black students. And the series had its own blind spots, which historians and educators have since pointed out.
In particular, "America Rock," an upbeat celebration of the bicentennial, covers the American Revolution and women's suffrage but skips over the Civil War and slavery. (The Roots filled in this hole in a 2017 episode of "black-ish" with "I Am a Slave," about Juneteenth.) "Elbow Room" is a jaunty story of westward expansion from the point of view of white settlers, with little note of who got elbowed out. (One scene shows a settler taking a toy arrow through his hat.) America's unflattering history didn't make the cut because mass broadcasting meant not alienating the masses.
But whatever its limits, "Schoolhouse Rock" at least told us we were equal: We counted with the same numbers, our hearts pumped the same blood, we were entitled to the same inalienable rights.
And it operated in a period when people saw the same media and accepted the same facts. Months after its premiere, the Watergate hearings also aired on national TV. They were able eventually to turn even many Republicans against President Nixon, in part because Americans watched the same story together, without a partisan cable and internet ecosystem to spin the investigation as a witch hunt.
It's tempting to say that you couldn't make "Schoolhouse Rock" again today. But I'm sure you could, even if it would be slightly different. Current kids' shows like Netflix's "We the People" are in a way exactly that. What you couldn't create again today is the mass audience, or the context in which we assembled, one nation, sitting cross-legged in front of our cathode-ray teacher.
Instead, we have "Schoolhouse Rock" binge-watches and sing-alongs, which, like all exercises in nostalgia, offer the tantalizing pleasure of stretching to touch yesterday, though we know we can't. The past is like infinity, a concept that "Schoolhouse Rock" also introduced to my generation. "No one ever gets there," as "My Hero, Zero" taught us. "But you could try."

Is a Spoonful of Sea Moss the Key to Good Health?

In videos on TikTok, influencers wince as they dig spoons into jars of what looks like slime. Sometimes the glop is pale green or yellow, sometimes it’s deep red. Some people wrinkle their noses and grimace as they swallow a dollop; others sniff their spoons and grin into the camera. “It kind of smells like ocean water,” one woman said before choking down a glob and then covering her mouth, appearing to gag, eyes watering. “It’s really good,” she said flatly and unconvincingly, blinking away tears. “I’m going to do it every day.”
They are among a number of people online who have been promoting the health benefits of sea moss — an edible sea vegetable in the algae family that is packed with nutrients like folate, vitamin K, vitamin B, iron, iodine, magnesium, zinc and calcium.
While the plant can be consumed raw and in supplement form — including as pills, powders and gummies — it’s most often eaten as a gel, made by soaking the dried plant in water, blending it and letting it coalesce in the fridge. Some claim that a scoop or more per day can heal their gut, clear their skin, regulate their menstrual cycle, strengthen their immune system or help them shed pounds. But is this hype based on science?
Here’s what to know before slurping down a spoonful.
What is sea moss?
Sea moss is a spiky, frilly sea vegetable that somewhat resembles frisée lettuce when it’s in the ocean. It thrives along the Atlantic coasts, mainly between North America and Europe, and in the warm waters of Asia, South America, Africa and parts of the Caribbean. When dried and packaged, the plant looks like cooked ramen noodles, with tangled tendrils that clump together. Food manufacturers harvest it for its carrageenan, an ingredient that acts as a thickening agent for foods like ice cream, chocolate milk and creamers.
But because it’s so nutrient-rich, people sometimes eat it in hopes of improving their health — swirling the gel into smoothies, blending it into puddings or eating it straight from a jar.
The gel often tastes fishy and has a slick, slimy texture. Raw sea moss can also have an earthy, ocean-like taste, not unlike an oyster or a clam — which can be off-putting to some, said Brooke Levine, a dietitian nutritionist at NYU Langone Health.
When did sea moss become so popular?
Sea moss has received a number of celebrity endorsements on social media in recent years. In 2020, Kim Kardashian shared on Twitter that she drank sea moss smoothies as part of her diet; last summer, Erewhon Market, a grocery chain based in Los Angeles, released “Hailey Bieber’s Strawberry Glaze Skin Smoothie” — complete with sea moss gel. Rapper Meek Mill mused online in 2019 that maybe sea moss made him smarter, and in 2021, former Disney Channel actress Skai Jackson said she ate sea moss “every single day.”
Sea moss also gained attention last fall when a flurry of panicky social media posts from fans of the plant claimed that the Food and Drug Administration was going to ban all sea moss products, possibly because of certain unproven health claims. While the FDA has issued warning letters to makers of sea moss-containing products in the past (including to a company that claimed its product could prevent or treat COVID-19), the posts about the ban turned out to be based on misinformation. But the passionate reactions of some users showed just how fervent a following the plant had gained.
Is sea moss actually good for you?
Sea moss, in gel or other forms, can be a relatively low-calorie conduit to adding more nutrients to your diet, said Dr. Melinda Ring, the executive director of the Osher Center for Integrative Health at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. The plant is rich in antioxidants, which can break down free radicals that damage our cells, she said. And sea moss gel contains large amounts of potassium, an essential mineral that supports muscle contraction and blood pressure control.
But while nutrition experts say that the nutrients in sea moss might offer some health benefits, the hype is probably overblown, Ring said. “Like all of the superfoods that have come and gone, there’s some truth to it,” she said. “It’s just not a magical thing that everyone should be taking.”
No clinical trials have investigated whether sea moss is beneficial for humans, Levine said, though seaweed in general has been well researched: It’s packed with vitamins and minerals similar to those found in sea moss, and some studies suggest that certain fatty acids and vitamins in some types of seaweed, like omega-3 fatty acids and vitamins D and B12, can help strengthen the immune system.
But without hard and fast data on sea moss itself, Ring said, its health effects aren’t totally clear.
Besides, Levine said, you’re most likely already getting the same nutrients found in sea moss if you follow a well-balanced diet. And if you don’t, she said, consuming sea moss won’t counteract poor nutrition choices. “It won’t help to eat sea moss gel if you’re getting a Big Mac,” Levine said.
Instead of turning to sea moss for a nutritional boost, she said, a few rolls of sushi containing seaweed can help supply comparable amounts of B vitamins and zinc. You can also get many of the nutrients in sea moss from leafy greens like kale, arugula or Swiss chard, said Mary Ellen DiPaola, a senior outpatient dietitian at the University of California, San Francisco.
Kristin Kirkpatrick, a dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic, agreed. “When a patient comes to me and says, ‘I saw this on TikTok, I’m thinking about taking it,’ I’m like, ‘That’s great, how about having more broccoli?’ ” she said.
Can sea moss help you lose weight?
Despite what some people are saying online, sea moss won’t suddenly speed up your metabolism, Kirkpatrick said. It does, however, contain plenty of prebiotic fiber, a food source for the good bacteria in your gut, which can help regulate your digestive system, she said.
Theoretically, sea moss gel could contribute to weight loss because its goopy consistency makes it slow to leave our stomachs, keeping us fuller for longer, Ring said, but it’s not guaranteed.
Can sea moss keep you from getting sick?
The individual nutrients found in sea moss — like B vitamins and zinc — indicate that, theoretically, the gel could help support your immune system, Ring said. But without data or clinical trials, there’s no proof that sea moss can prevent or cure any disease.
Are there risks associated with eating sea moss?
Sea moss contains high levels of iodine, which can damage your thyroid if consumed in large quantities, Ring said. If you want to try it, she recommended taking no more than two tablespoons of the gel at a time and using it every other day, rather than every day.
Like seaweed, sea moss may contain trace amounts of heavy metals like aluminum or cadmium, depending on where it’s grown. So you should be careful to not overdo it, Ring said.
If you’re taking sea moss in supplement form, keep in mind that the FDA does not strictly regulate supplements, so you can never be 100% sure that what is stated online or on a package is what’s in the product.
Is sea moss worth shelling out for?
A bag of the dried plant, which you can use to make sea moss gel at home, can be expensive. Some sellers on Amazon list it for around $20 per pound, others for around $80 per pound. A 16-ounce jug of premade gel can run around $15 on the lower end, or $60 on the higher end.
If you decide the expense is worth it, swallowing a spoonful of sea moss isn’t likely to harm you, experts said. But it won’t transform your health or body, either.
“When we’re having a conversation about diet, there’s never been a situation where we’ve found one food is the salvation we were searching for,” Kirkpatrick said. “It’s always a combination of factors.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Thrive Capital Said to Commit Funds to Stripe: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Thrive has committed $ 1 billion, which would value the payments provider Stripe at about $ 55 billion to $ 60 billion, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Thrive Capital, the investment firm founded by Joshua Kushner, is leading a potential investment in the payments provider Stripe at a valuation of $ 55 billion to $ 60 billion, down sharply from two years ago, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
Stripe is aiming to raise roughly $ 2.5 billion, one of the people said. Thrive has committed $ 1 billion, said another person familiar with the situation, who requested anonymity because the talks are confidential.
If completed, the funding could give Stripe breathing room amid a tough market for public listings. The money is expected to be used to pay the start-up's tax liabilities and to allow its employees to sell their company shares. Many privately held tech companies use stock options to help recruit employees, but a faltering market for public offerings has made it difficult for employees to cash out of those shares. Some Stripe employees have stock grants that will start expiring next year if the company does not go public or raise new funding, a person familiar with the situation said.
The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Stripe had considered raising new funds.
Stripe's moves are being scrutinized because it was once the most highly valued private company in the United States. How it responds to an inhospitable market for public offerings could be a harbinger for how others manage it.
The company, which the brothers John and Patrick Collison founded in 2010, hired Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase to advise it on a potential public listing in the next year. It told employees last week that it was considering multiple routes to letting its employees cash out within 12 months.
Among the options is listing Stripe's shares on the public market. Another is to raise money privately followed by a tender offer, in which the company would sell employee shares to other investors while staying private. The new funding does not mean a public listing is off the table, one of the people with knowledge of the matter said.
A valuation of $ 55 billion to $ 60 billion would be a steep drop for a company that last raised money at a roughly $ 95 billion valuation in 2021. Stripe sells payment processing software to companies including Peloton, Wayfair and Amazon.
Over the last year, the start-up funding environment has deteriorated amid rising interest rates and a renewed focus on profits. Some tech companies have found it harder to attract new investments and many start-ups have had to cut their costs.
For Thrive, known for its investments in start-ups like Skims, Warby Parker and SpaceX, a $ 1 billion bet is a big check. Mr. Kushner has been trying to steer the firm out of the shadow of his older brother, Jared, who was a top adviser to his father-in-law, former President Donald J. Trump.
Thrive closed a $ 3 billion fund, its largest ever, last year. Last week, it announced that it had sold a minority stake in the firm to executives including Robert Iger, Disney's chief executive, and Henry Kravis, a co-founder of private equity firm KKR. The deal valued Thrive at $ 5.3 billion. It is also in talks to invest in the artificial intelligence company OpenAI.

An English Stalwart Has Fallen, And It Can't Get Up: [Sports Desk]

Full text: Europe is filled with big clubs that lost their way. But soccer's fallen giants will never rise again until they face what they've become.
Frank Lampard can, at least, be sure that there will be no lasting damage. The disappointment of his firing as Everton manager will sting for a while, of course, but there is little reason to believe it will be held against him. A failure to meet expectations at Everton has long since become the sort of thing that might happen to anyone.
It did not, after all, stop Carlo Ancelotti -- who steered Everton to the dizzying heights of 10th in the Premier League in his sole full season at Goodison Park -- from getting the Real Madrid job. Less than a year after leaving Merseyside, Ancelotti picked up his fourth Champions League trophy (a record), and became the first manager in history to win domestic titles in all of Europe's five most illustrious leagues.
Ancelotti's predecessor at Goodison, Marco Silva, has not done quite so well, but his Fulham team currently sits seventh in the Premier League. Ronald Koeman left England with his reputation shredded, but he has since managed the Dutch national team, Barcelona, and the Dutch national team again. Roberto Martínez spent eight years in charge of Belgium; his next task is to take Portugal to the European Championship next summer.
Indeed, of the six most recent (permanent) managers to have clasped English soccer's great poisoned chalice before Lampard, so far only one -- Sam Allardyce -- failed to recover, and that might be attributed at least in part to his pre-existing, not especially flattering and largely self-inflicted caricature. (Rafa Benítez, whom Lampard replaced a year ago, has yet to return to work.)
That is instructive. Only one of those managers, Ancelotti, left the club on his terms and with the broad beneficence of the fans. The rest left Goodison Park bilious, rancorous and, more than once, on the verge of outright mutiny.
That so few of those managers have been sullied by the manner of their departures indicates that soccer, as a whole, does not feel Everton, these days, is the sort of place where a manager's talent can be accurately gauged. Lampard -- now four years into his managerial career and with little proof, either way, of whether he is particularly cut out for the job or not -- will benefit from that just as Koeman, Silva and all of the others did.
Why that should be, of course, has been outlined frequently in the days since Lampard was fired.
As noted by this newsletter last week, Everton's majority owner, Farhad Moshiri, lacks a clear vision for what he wants the club to be, other than -- as a statement put it -- not in the Premier League's relegation zone. He has, in the six years since he bought Everton, spent something north of $ 500 million on players, but the recruitment has been so scattershot that it has incontrovertibly made the team worse.
He appointed a director of football and then, by most accounts, did not empower him to sign anyone. He has hired and fired managers with such speed that Lampard's team for his final game, a defeat at West Ham, contained players brought in by four of his predecessors. Everton is a patchwork of different influences and ideas and policies, a consequence of years of failure.
Both among the club's fan base and soccer's professional commentariat, conventional wisdom has it that it is from there that the tendrils of Everton's chronic disappointment, its permanent crisis, climb: not with the manager but with the system in which they are expected, forlornly, to work. It is, of course, correct. It may not, though, quite get to the root of the issue.
It is impossible to escape Everton's history. It is there, emblazoned on the stadium, in a series of snapshots commemorating the club's finest teams, its greatest achievements. It is there, in the words to "Grand Old Team," the song that long served as one of the club's prematch standards. It even warranted a mention in the statement Lampard released after his departure, in which he paid homage to the club's "incredible" history.
That is understandable: Everton's history is unusually illustrious. It is, depending on your preferred metric, either the fourth most successful team in English history -- in terms of league titles won, ahead of Manchester City, Chelsea and Tottenham -- or the eighth, if total trophy haul is deemed a better measure. That history is, as it should be, a source of immense pride.
It is also, though, a prison. The metastasis of soccer over the last two decades has, effectively, rendered history largely irrelevant as a marker of power. Everton's nine league titles do not mean it earns more from the Premier League's television deals than Brentford, just as A.C. Milan's seven European Cups do not give it more financial firepower than Bournemouth (Champions League titles: zero).
The old hierarchies no longer hold, as the rise of Manchester City and Paris St.-Germain make clear, toppled and leveled by the flood of money rushing into the game from broadcasters and sponsors, from oligarchs and hedge funds. History is no longer a draw. Or, rather, it is not nearly so significant a draw as wealth, or prospects, or status, or facilities, or plans.
That adjusted reality has affected the game's self-appointed superpowers, of course, just as surely as it has affected the vast majority of clubs, the minnows and the traditionally mediocre, all of whom have been forced to adapt to narrowed horizons and limited ambitions.
The impact has been most profound, though, on the class of club to which Everton belongs, those on the second rung of the game's long established and now defunct power structure, those who are best regarded as soccer's cruiserweights.
Those teams can be placed, broadly, into two categories. There are those who have accommodated themselves to the way things are now, who have managed to carve out a new definition of success that enables them to find some contentment in a hostile environment.
For Benfica and Ajax, say, that has taken the form of trading continental prominence for domestic supremacy, secured thanks to a steady stream of young talent. For Borussia Dortmund, it has involved accepting a place as the game's most reliable springboard, a role as a midwife to greatness.
And then there are those who seem to be weighed down by the burden of their history: Valencia, Inter Milan, Marseille, Schalke, Hamburg, West Ham, Aston Villa and, of course, Everton, all unable or unwilling to adopt the methods of their former peers to stake out a new place for themselves.
It is no surprise that these teams have become, for the most part, the most unstable, the least contented clubs in Europe. Happiness is a fleeting thing in soccer; elite sport does not lend itself to lasting satisfaction. But these clubs often seem the most unhappy, caught in a grinding, unending identity crisis, trapped between what they were and what they are.
That is what lies at the heart of the modern Everton. Like Lampard, even Moshiri, to some extent, can be viewed as a consequence as much as a cause of the problem. The club was so desperate to be restored to what it once was that it sold itself to someone who -- on the balance of the last six years -- has very little clue what he is doing, beyond hiring famous managers and signing expensive players and hoping for the best.
And it is what will continue to undermine Everton until it is resolved, as the teams above them streak away and the teams traditionally beneath them -- the smart, progressive ones, at least -- roar past. Everton has never been willing to surrender the idea that it is more than a way-station, that it is a destination sort of a club, even if doing so is the first step to returning itself to relevance. To do so would be to think small, and thinking small is unimaginable when you believe, when history dictates, that you are big.
Correspondence
Thanks, first of all, to the half-dozen eagle-eyed readers who got in touch to inform me that I had my magical kingdoms mixed up: Disney World is in Florida, by all accounts, whereas Disneyland is in California. I have, alas, been to neither, owing to a lifelong -- and to be honest perfectly logical -- fear of giant anthropomorphized mice.
The issue of celebrations, meanwhile, seems to animate even more of you than the misattribution of theme parks. "I wonder if goal celebrations can (or used to) be culture-specific," wrote Thomas Bodenberg. "In 1994, Brazil played Sweden at the late, unlamented Pontiac Silverdome. When Kennet Andersson scored for Sweden, putting them 1-0 up, he just jogged stoically back to his end, awaiting kickoff. I wonder if that was more a product of Swedish culture than the individual."
What irks Allan Culham, on the other hand, is how often goal-scorers "do not recognize whoever set them up to get it. Often the assist is the most impressive part, but players celebrate as if it was a result of their effort alone."
It feels to me as if many players do, these days, opt for the "emphatic pointing" method of celebration, singling out the teammate who made the chance, but this hits upon an issue close to my heart, and one I have discussed with a host of current and former players: the cliché runs that scoring a goal is the hardest job in soccer, but I would contend that making one is infinitely more difficult. (They largely disagree with me.)
Dan Lachman is not short on ambition. It is time, he wrote, to "retire" the tradition/habit/pretension of referring to players by the role seemingly predicated by their numbers. "Does the casual fan have any clue what a 'No. 6' is? How about calling it a holding, or defensive, midfielder? It's time for this to go."
Oddly, this is a relatively new phenomenon: At a rough guess, the phrase "No. 6" would never have appeared in English commentary of a game even 10 years ago. It is a recent (and entirely harmless) import, and I would agree that it does not actually offer the clarity people assume. What a No. 6 does in Spain, say, is different from what one does in Germany, which is different again from how the Dutch perceive the position.
And a forlorn request from Tony De Palma. "I long to know what is being sung by fans at Premier League stadia," he wrote. "I love the feel of the spectacle, the ambient sound, but I am unable to make out all but the most well-known chants. How can I, an American onlooker, figure out what these English fans are singing?"
Alas, Tony, the first assumption should always be that whatever it is, the lyrics would almost certainly make the Grey Lady blush. I remember going to a baseball game in San Francisco a few years ago with my wife, who is no fan of either sport. So powerful is social conditioning, though, that after a few minutes even she turned to me, with the air of a disappointed line manager conducting a performance review, and asked why it was that the fans were not swearing at the opposition team.

Full text: It's all those pandemic puppies.
Dressed in black leggings and a puffer jacket, Bethany Lane, 35, was walking down Bleecker Street in Manhattan last Friday afternoon with a pack of three goldendoodles and one bernedoodle named Tinkerbelle. They poked their noses into the Whalebone store to collect some treats, before trotting along the Hudson River Park and having their photos taken by several tourists.
After an hour, Ms. Lane took them home to a stately townhouse owned by a 40-something professional couple who made their fortune in real estate. "It's my job to make the dogs happy when their owners are busy," she said. "I fall in love with these dogs. They are like my babies."
Ms. Lane started walking dogs 11 years ago, after graduating from Rutgers University and moving to New York City to pursue a public health career. "I had to pay my rent and student loans, so I went on Craigslist," she said. "I saw that somebody would pay me to walk dogs. As an animal lover who is obsessed with dogs, it was perfect."
As business took off, she founded Whistle & Wag in 2014 as a boutique pet care service in the West Village. At one point, she was working 12-hour days, and she was able to pay off her student loans and hire other dog walkers.
Now, nearly three years after the start of the pandemic, she can't keep up with demand. After raising her rates (she quoted one customer $ 35 a walk), and taking on dozens of new clients, she expects she will have made six figures last year (she declined to be more specific).
She feels confident enough about business that she bought a weekend home in Tuckerton, N.J., last summer. "It's a three-bedroom home, but it has a very nice yard, and it is on the bay," said Ms. Lane, who lives in a two-bedroom rental in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn with her longtime partner. "I can go to whatever restaurant I want, whenever I want. I can go on vacation. I am very fortunate."
"If I would have told my younger self I can make a living caring for dogs," she added, "I never would have believed it."
It is a lucrative time to be a dog walker, especially for pet entrepreneurs who cater to the wealthy. Though searches on Rover and other job sites yield beginner dog walkers in Manhattan who charge as little as $ 14 for a 30-minute walk, seasoned dog walkers with well-heeled clients are charging nearly three times as much, and earning $ 100,000 or more a year.
After all, it is a bull market for pet care providers. According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, more than 23 million American households -- nearly one in five nationwide -- acquired a dog or cat during the pandemic. With many Americans back in the office, somebody has to walk all those pandemic puppies.
"Prepandemic I used to get a call maybe one or two times a month from a potential new client," Ms. Lane said. "I get multiple calls a week now. It is a lot of puppies."
Dog walking traditionally appealed to those seeking a stable gig but also the flexibility to pursue other passions. It was an attractive job for actors, musicians, writers, students, retirees, stay-at-home parents and those figuring out what they want to do.
The rise in pet ownership, combined with a boom in pet care, has turned dog walking more into a business venture -- not only for standard walks but also for more upscale services that cater to city dogs like nature hikes, day trips to farms, training camps and dog spas.
Among those looking to capitalize on the moment is Michael Josephs, 34, a former special needs teacher in Brooklyn who used to train Willy, his mixed black Labrador, at Prospect Park after school. "After three months I could ride my bike into the park, and he would run behind me," he said. "People saw our rapport and asked me if I could train their dog."
In 2019 Mr. Josephs decided to quit his teaching job to start Parkside Pups, charging $ 20 for a 30-minute group walk. Within a month he had about eight clients, working about five hours a day to make about $ 30,000 a year.
Business came to a halt during the pandemic lockdowns of 2020 but has since rebounded. "In 2022 we've been rocking it," said Mr. Joseph, who lives in Middletown, N.J. "We used to mostly see clients in Downtown Brooklyn or around Prospect Park. Now we see dogs in neighborhoods you never saw many dogs before like Ditmas Park and Windsor Terrace."
Parkside Pups now offers puppy training ( $ 60 for one hour), pet sitting ( $ 65 a day) and 15-minute puppy check-ins ( $ 12) -- and generated more than $ 100,000 in income last year, Mr. Joseph said.
Mr. Joseph's wife, Clarissa Soto, helps with the business, and the couple is considering expanding to a doggy day care near Prospect Park and an overnight camp in western Connecticut. "The biggest thing for us is we now have financial security for our son," said Ms. Soto, who gave birth last year. "We have a savings fund set up for him, we have a college fund."
They also have more discretionary income. "We just did a whole vacation with our families down in Disney World for six days," Mr. Josephs said. "We went to Miami. We were in Canandaigua for a wedding, and stayed for a couple of days. We can splurge."
Some dog walkers are doing so well financially that they are once again pursuing their passion projects. Maren Lavelle, 28, an aspiring filmmaker in New York City, took over a dog walking business, Big City Woof Walker, with a college friend in 2017.
At first, they worked eight-hour days, walking 15 to 25 dogs each day, and making $ 15 per walk. It was a grind -- endless hours of picking up poop and corralling barking dogs -- but they made enough to own their business outright, and hire about 10 walkers. Although the company closed for a few months during the pandemic, business has never been better.
They now have about 700 clients, employ about 25 dog walkers in New York City, along with an additional 13 walkers in Chicago, where they opened a second operation. To cater to the puppy boom, the company also offers socialization training. "A lot of the pandemic puppies didn't get even the baseline of socialization," Ms. Lavelle said. "They are fearful or react to every sound or movement because it's super-novel to them."
Ms. Lavelle feels secure enough financially that she has returned to filmmaking, and is making a short horror film set in upstate New York. "When the business took so much out of me and didn't pay that much, it was hard to give my energy to filmmaking," she said. "I actually now have a production company with my husband, and we make narrative films."
"It costs money to make these films," Ms. Lavelle added. "It's cool that I can take my dog walking success and pursue a creative career."

Full text: Courtney Archie impressed Ashleigh Lewis with her southern hospitality. A few years later, they chose to get married in New Orleans to honor Ms. Archie's ancestors.
In December 2020, Courtney Beneé Archie left New Orleans to accept a contract nurse anesthetist position in Newport News, Va. At the time, she was a nurse anesthetist at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge, La.
Her work hours had been reduced and she needed a change of scenery.
It was the first year of Covid, so there were few places to go out. In April 2021, Ms. Archie, 39, decided to sign up for Tinder which is where, three days in, she connected with Kermit Ashleigh Lewis, 40.
It was a photo of Ms. Archie in hunting regalia that first caught his eye. "I hunt too, and don't meet a lot of women who hunt," said Mr. Lewis, who goes by Ashleigh. "She was glammed up in another picture, and I thought, 'How could she do both?"'
Mr. Lewis, who grew up in Chesapeake, Va., and lived in Virginia Beach at the time, is a chief gunner's mate with the U.S. Coast Guard, based in Portsmouth, Va. His first marriage ended in divorce.
Ms. Archie grew up in Baton Rouge and received her bachelor's of science degree from the School of Nursing at Southern University and A&M College in Baton Rouge, and a doctor of nursing degree at Louisiana State University in New Orleans. She now works as a nurse anesthetist at Riverside Regional Medical Center in Newport News, Va.
For a week, they texted from work by day and talked by phone late into the night, often while Ms. Archie cooked.
"We were like high school kids on the phone," Ms. Archie said.
A week later, they had their first date at Monsoon, an Indian restaurant in Hampton, Va.
"Ashleigh was so different, so attentive," said Ms. Archie, who is taking Mr. Lewis's name. "He really listened to me and asked me so many questions."
When Mr. Lewis dropped Ms. Archie off at her apartment, she brought him a to-go meal she had made: smothered turkey necks with gravy, rice and collard greens.
"That's something my mom would do," he said. "I thought, 'Who is this woman?' She had that southern charm I just love."
Both said they knew they had met "the one" that night.
She met his family a month later, and a month after that, he met hers. In August, Ms. Archie and her miniature husky, Piper, moved in with Mr. Lewis and his French bulldog, Stitch. "Dogs were hesitant, but they quickly realized neither was leaving," she said.
Mr. Lewis organized a trip to the Big Island of Hawaii for Valentine's Day 2022 with a couple who are good friends. On the beach outside of Lava Lava Beach Club, on the black lava rocks, he got down on one knee and proposed at sunset.

Two months before their wedding, the couple, who now live in Chesapeake, took part in an Iroquoian wedding ceremony at the 30th annual Corn Harvest Powwow and School Day, an annual gathering for the Cheroenhaka Nottoway Indian tribe of Southampton County. The outdoor ceremony was officiated by the groom's father's cousin, County Chief Walt "Red Hawk" Brown on tribal land in Courtland, Va., to honor the groom's deceased father and his Native American ancestry.
They were married Jan. 7 in front of 250 guests at the New Orleans Board of Trade, an events space near the French Quarter, by Apostle Kenneth Diggs, a founder of the Eternity Community Church in Frisco, Texas, who is also the bride's uncle.
Ms. Archie had an unusual request when she approached their wedding planner, Audi Brown. She deliberately chose a venue near the French Quarter not for its famed joy and merriment, but because it was where many slaves were bought and sold.
"For that area to be filled with so much hurt and suffering and blood and tears," Ms. Archie said, "wouldn't it be nice to celebrate and bring love and happiness back to that place where our ancestors didn't have that?"
While Ms. Brown has a strict "no plantations" policy, a Black bride who said she wanted to "reclaim the narrative," was something new and different. She was persuaded.
Given the bride's love of Disney films -- "The Princess and the Frog" is a particular favorite of the couple -- the wedding had a fairy tale theme. (The fact that the groom shares a first name with a famous frog, too, isn't lost on them.)
"Ashleigh is so kind, and tries everything to make me happy," said Ms. Archie, adding, "Our wedding was truly like a fairy tale."

Ron DeSantis Likes His Culture Wars: [Op-Ed]

Author: Bouie, Jamelle

Publication info: Bouie, Jamelle.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Here's a question: What does Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida think about Medicare? Medicaid? Social Security? The Affordable Care Act?
DeSantis has built his national political image on well-timed and strategically chosen battles. First it was opposition to Covid mitigation strategies and vaccine mandates. Then it was open hostility toward L.G.B. (and especially) T. Floridians and anything and anyone deemed woke. Now it is an escalation of both moves, aimed at seizing the right flank in the Republican presidential contest, which has already begun to move away from behind-the-scenes jockeying to open competition between rivals.
DeSantis says he wants to ban vaccine mandates and restrict mask rules and make Florida a safe haven from what he calls a "biomedical security state." He also wants state universities to provide the number and ages of students who have sought or received treatment for gender dysphoria, which critics argue is the governor's first step toward banning those services. And his Department of Education has already rejected an Advanced Placement pilot course covering African American studies on the grounds that it is a tool for political indoctrination. "As submitted, the course is a vehicle for a political agenda and leaves large, ambiguous gaps that can be filled with additional ideological material, which we will not allow," Bryan Griffin, DeSantis's press secretary, said.
By no means is any of this trivial or unimportant. Florida is the third-most-populous state. To launch a war on vaccines or use state power to harass transgender students is to make life difficult, even dangerous, for thousands of people.
And yet there is a reason DeSantis has made these issues, and virtually nothing else, the platform from which he hopes to build national power. By leaning into high-profile battles as a culture warrior par excellence for the most reactionary segment of the American public -- last year, to give another example, he picked a fight with the Disney corporation -- DeSantis has made himself the hero of conservative elites and the bête noire of liberals and Democrats without so much as mentioning his radical and unpopular views on social insurance and the welfare state.
As a congressman, serving three terms from 2013 to 2018 (when he ran for governor), DeSantis was one of the founders of the House Freedom Caucus, the most hard-line and conservative faction in the House Republican conference, now in the spotlight because of its leadership battle with Speaker Kevin McCarthy and its driving role in using the debt ceiling to force spending cuts on an unsuspecting public.
DeSantis was an especially fierce opponent of so-called entitlements and other forms of federal aid. He helped lead the effort to shut down the government over funding for the Affordable Care Act in 2013 and the same year voted to pass a budget resolution that would have cut more than $ 250 billion from Social Security and Medicare over a decade. In 2017, like most other Republicans, he voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act and to cut taxes on corporations, high earners and wealthy heirs.
DeSantis believes, according to his 2011 book, "Dreams From Our Founding Fathers: First Principles in the Age of Obama," that the framers of the Constitution "strived to construct a system of government that prevented government-mandated wealth redistribution." Turning his attention to the Affordable Care Act and the federal bureaucracy, DeSantis condemns both as "administrative despotism" that have exerted "stifling constraints on the whole of society." And while he doesn't take direct aim at the New Deal and its offspring -- the whole book is framed as an attack on the Obama administration -- his arguments against redistributive policy should apply as much to Social Security as they do to Obamacare. It is not for nothing that Florida is one of 11 states that has not adopted the Medicaid expansion.
Yes, as governor of Florida, DeSantis has eagerly used a windfall of Covid relief funds to strengthen his political position in the state, with bonuses for emergency medical workers and new money for environmental protection. But that does not mean he has changed his thinking on these larger questions of federal spending.
The upshot of all this is that DeSantis's opponents should, as much as possible, refuse to play his game. You don't have to confront him on his terrain. You could instead force him to acknowledge or account for his other, more unpopular political commitments. Interestingly, this is the approach that Donald Trump might take to rebuff DeSantis in a Republican primary contest. "One area in which Trump and his allies smell that kind of weakness in DeSantis is on Social Security," Rolling Stone reports. Trump, it should be said, used this strategy to great success against his Republican opponents in 2016.
It might be too much to ask liberals and Democrats to take a lesson from the former president, but here they should. The best way to neutralize DeSantis as a political force might be to spend less time on cultural conflict and more time making the clear case that if given the chance, he would slash what's left of the safety net and use the proceeds to help the rich stay rich.

Gerrie Coetzee, 67, South African Boxer and Soft-Spoken Opponent of Apartheid: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He won the World Boxing Association title in 1983, became a symbol of racial comity and showed a surprising gentleness in public.
Gerrie Coetzee, a South African heavyweight boxing champion who rejected the epithet "great white hope" and criticized apartheid, earning the respect of Nelson Mandela, died on Jan. 12 at his home in Bloubergstrand, a suburb of Cape Town. He was 67.
The cause was lung cancer, his longtime manager, Thinus Strydom, said.
After losing bids for the World Boxing Association title in 1979 and 1980, Coetzee avenged himself in 1983, when he knocked out the previously undefeated Michael Dokes. Gerrie (pronounced herry -- rhymes with "merry" -- with a guttural "h") Coetzee (pronounced coat-SEE-uh) became Africa's first world heavyweight champion.
In that era, white South Africans could still be described by The Washington Post as a "beleaguered minority" for whom Coetzee's attempts at boxing glory represented "a chance at a national vindication."
Instead, Coetzee's fame worked against apartheid. His 1979 bid for the title brought the first racially integrated crowd -- 81,000 people -- to Loftus Versfeld Stadium, in Pretoria.
When The New York Times canvassed people in the Black township of Soweto for their views of the fight -- which pitted John Tate, an African American, against an Afrikaner -- even supporters of Tate frequently praised Coetzee.
"Coetzee is a better fighter and a more principled man," one schoolboy told The Times. "Tate is just here to collect a purse." In contrast, he continued, "Coetzee will use the title to speak out against apartheid."
Coetzee did exactly that at a news conference before the fight. "What really makes me happy is for Black, brown and white people to accept me as their fighter," he said, adding, "People should be treated on merit and not on race or color."
International sporting contests generally barred South African athletes, making Coetzee one of the nation's few worldwide athletic stars. Both white and Black South Africans crowded around radios in the middle of the night to hear broadcasts of his fights abroad. One listener, an amateur boxer looking for distraction during an imprisonment of 27 years, was Nelson Mandela.
He sent Coetzee a letter of encouragement before the Dokes fight, and Coetzee replied by sending a videotape of his victory, Mr. Strydom said. For a photo shoot during one of several meetings, the two men faced each other in a boxing stance and smiled.
Coetzee's independent-mindedness was not only ideological. In interviews, he countered expectations for a professional pugilist, speaking softly about boxers who had intimidated him. In the ring, he informed opponents in a matter-of-fact tone that he would knock them out. He took breaks in training to work as a technician at a friend's dental laboratory.
When Coetzee traveled, he called home every day to check on the well-being of Wendy, a companion he always wanted at his side. Wendy was an English cocker spaniel he had bought when she was a puppy.
Coetzee's wife "wasn't too keen on Wendy in the bed," he told The Times in 1982. "She was afraid of fleas or ticks, but I said, 'Forget it -- my Wendy is a clean dog.' Now she loves Wendy as much as I do."
Gerhardus Christian Coetzee was born on April 8, 1955, in Johannesburg. He grew up in Boksburg, a nearby mining town. His father, Philip, was a car mechanic who ran a local amateur boxing club; his mother, Meisie (Vu Vuurs) Coetzee, was a homemaker.
Gerrie was a shy boy not particularly interested in boxing, but his father paid him 50 cents a week to spar. By 13, he had won a provincial bantamweight title.
He went pro in 1974 and boxed while studying to be a dental technician at the University of the Witwatersrand. He graduated in 1976.
He rose to fame in June 1979 when he faced off against Leon Spinks, who a year earlier had fought Muhammad Ali in two high-profile bouts, winning the first and losing the second but briefly gaining the status of undisputed heavyweight champion.
In what an announcer called an "amazing upset," Coetzee pulverized Spinks, knocking him down three times in the first round. The decisive blows came from Coetzee's right hand, around which a mystique grew. He fractured it again and again, and a 1978 operation fused his metacarpal bones into a permanent fist, leading some to call the hand "bionic."
In 1979, The Washington Post quoted a doctor saying Coetzee's right hand "could punch a hole in a brick wall."
That year, Coetzee had the chance to become World Boxing Association champion, a title that Ali had vacated by retiring. Instead, John Tate handed Coetzee his first professional defeat. In another title bout the next year, Coetzee was knocked out by Mike Weaver.
That match haunted him.
"I saw the punch coming, I saw the crowd clearly when I was down, I heard the referee counting, but my legs just would not respond to my brain," he told The Times in 1981. For three nights he did not sleep, replaying the scene in his mind's eye, he said.
After Dokes beat Weaver in 1983, Coetzee got a final shot at the title. In that fight he was the aggressor, driving Dokes to the ropes for much of the fight. In the fifth round, he gave Dokes the first knockdown of Dokes's career and, in the 10th round, he used his left hand to prop Dokes up while pounding him with his right, sending him conclusively to the mat.
Crucially, Coetzee displayed new power in his left hook, which he used to set up the devastating punches of his infamous right fist.

At the pinnacle of his career, Coetzee was one of three claimants to the title of world heavyweight champion, along with Larry Holmes, the International Boxing Federation titleholder, and Pinklon Thomas, the holder of the World Boxing Council's belt. Schism reigned until Mike Tyson became the undisputed boxing champion in 1987.
Coetzee lost his title belt to Greg Page, who knocked him out in 1984. His career in prime time ended ignominiously, with a first-round flattening by a brawny and focused Frank Bruno in 1986.
Coetzee married Rina Steyn in 1976. She survives him, as do their son, Gerhard; their daughters, Lana and Tana Coetzee; two brothers, Jansie and Flip; a sister, Gerda van Aswegen; and seven grandchildren.
Part of Coetzee's image as a figure of racial comity came from his friendship with his sparring partner, the African American boxer Randy Stephens, and his worship of Ali. During a stint in the army, Coetzee spent most of a month's salary on a copy of "The Greatest," Ali's 1975 memoir.
Coetzee and his wife were invited to his hero's hotel room in the late 1970s. When a TV crew showed up, Ali began taunting Coetzee, crowing that he could beat him "to the moon" and suggesting that Coetzee's wife was probably a more skilled fighter than Coetzee.
But Coetzee preferred to dwell on what happened when the crew left. "He was nice again," he recalled to The Times, "and poured us some tea."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: LADYSMITH, British Columbia -- I am sitting across from Pamela Anderson, at her kitchen table, trying to explain to her that I have an app on my phone that will make me look like Pamela Anderson.
"What?" she says, her blue eyes widening. "What is it? What could it possibly do?"
I open my phone to show her. Ms. Anderson, 55, puts on a pair of reading glasses, then examines my screen, which has transformed my face into a 1990s version of her: hair in a tousled top bun, pencil-thin eyebrows, mouth in a lip-lined pout.
She shrieks. "That's insane." When I angle the camera toward her, she ducks out of the frame. "I am not doing it on myself. I will not. I refuse," she says.
She's laughing, but she means it. She doesn't want to look like a 20-something version of herself, nor does she want to relive that period in her life. Or at least she's not going to let someone else force her to do so.
The world learned that last year, when it got word of Ms. Anderson's reaction to "Pam & Tommy," the Hulu series that tells the story of her life and, in particular, her marriage to the Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee, the father of her children.
That relationship began with a four-day courtship in Cancún, Mexico, and a wedding, with Ms. Anderson in a string bikini, and mostly ended with Mr. Lee in jail after striking his wife while she was holding their newborn son. The marriage began to unravel after a video of the couple having sex was stolen from a safe in their Malibu, Calif., home -- then went the 1990s version of viral.
If you grew up in a certain era, you know about that tape. Maybe you even watched it. The VHS was delivered wrapped in brown paper to the sticky hands of teenage boys and men all over the world, earning its distributors $ 77 million in less than 12 months.
What you might not have known -- at least not until you watched "Pam & Tommy" -- was that the tape was stolen, not leaked by the couple for publicity, and that Ms. Anderson and Mr. Lee unsuccessfully sued to try to stop it. It also wasn't a sex tape, at least not originally. It was a 54-minute home video, filmed during the early months of their relationship, roughly eight minutes of which featured actual sex acts. Those moments were spliced together by skeezy porn distributors, turning him into a sex god and her into a punchline.
"Pam & Tommy" was meant to set the record straight on that bit of retro tabloid history and to depict what happens when millions of people got intimate access to the world's most famous sex symbol.
But Ms. Anderson wouldn't play the game. She refused to watch the show. When Lily James, the actress who stars in it, reached out after taking the role to ask if they could speak -- saying in a handwritten letter, that she wanted nothing more than to honor her -- Ms. Anderson snubbed her. A scanned copy of that letter still sits in Ms. Anderson's inbox somewhere, unread.
For Ms. Anderson, "Pam & Tommy" felt like just another exploitation. Except this time it came wrapped in the paper-thin promise of some sort of salvation.
"It was already hurtful enough the first time," Ms. Anderson tells me, pausing as she takes a tray of roasted vegetables out of the oven. She looks ethereal in all white, barefaced and in a pair of slippers, against the backdrop of the snow outside. "It's like one of those things where you're going, 'Really?' People are still capitalizing off that thing?"
It is hard to overstate the influence that Ms. Anderson had on a particular era of culture, which happens to be the one that I grew up in. She was the distillation of straight male fantasy come to life -- a small-town Canadian girl next door who'd been transformed into pure American erotica.
She was already a Playboy model when she helped make "Baywatch," which was previously canceled, the most-watched television show in the world -- exporting the image of a platinum blond, blue-eyed California dream, running in slow motion in a red one-piece swimsuit, to more than 140 countries. Even three decades later, cosmetic surgeons credit Ms. Anderson with ushering in an era of plastic surgery that made them rich. She was the precursor to "Girls Gone Wild," to the bared abs and sexy baby voices of Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, to a whole swath of culture that seemed to argue for objectification as empowerment, as long as you could convince yourself you were the one in control.
Though to say she was objectified almost doesn't do her treatment justice. To look back on the many, many articles written about Ms. Anderson over the years is to learn that "heads, as they always do, turn" when she enters the room. That many of the words used to describe her "start with the letter B: buxom, blond, babelicious, bombshell, bodacious" and that on the day one women's magazine sat down to interview her, "her freckles stood out more than her breasts."
"Am I physically attracted to Pamela Anderson? Of course," the critic Chuck Klosterman wrote in his low culture manifesto, "Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs." "But the more I see her, the more I realize I'm not looking at a person I'd like to sleep with; I'm looking at America."
But if you really want to understand Ms. Anderson's cultural impact, simply try telling people you are writing an article about her. Women say things like, "I starved myself to look like her," while men suggest, "You should take a selfie with your boobs out," or ask, "Are you sure you don't need an assistant?" For years, Ms. Anderson would say in interviews, "I thought the novelty would wear off by now." It hasn't. She turns grown men into horny teenage versions of themselves.
And then, of course, there's that tape. That tape, which helped normalize online pornography and, quite literally, popularize the internet. It was a precursor to the celebrity sex tape as we know it and, ultimately, contributed to many of the privacy and revenge-porn laws that would make it harder to distribute today.
All of which made Ms. Anderson seem a perfect candidate for the kind of narrative reframing "Pam & Tommy" was offering -- the kind we're offering up to all sorts of women these days as we look back on the tragedies of their lives with a newer, more enlightened gaze.
And yet isn't it all a bit patronizing, this notion that a TV show should swoop in and correct the cultural record on her behalf? At the very least, it's awkward. "I mean, I'm probably a case study for any feminist," Ms. Anderson acknowledges, and she considers herself one, by the way. But she's not dead. Isn't it sort of weird for someone else to re-examine her story while she's right here?
'I just blocked it out'
For the past few years, Ms. Anderson has been doing something of a re-examination herself.
She sold her house in Malibu during the pandemic and moved back to her tiny hometown on Vancouver Island, on a woodsy property next to the sea that she bought from her grandmother two decades ago. Save for a brief relationship with a construction worker who was working on her house (you can read about that one in the tabloids), she says, this is the longest period she has ever been alone.
It was here, in a modest house next door to her parents -- she moved them onto the compound last year -- with her three dogs roaming the garden, where she began writing down her life story. (Want to do something awkward? Ms. Anderson jokes when I first meet her. Write a book about your life and then move your parents in next door.)
At first, she thought she might post snippets on her website -- a website, by the way, she only recently gained control of after years of impersonators using it to sell fake merch and cheap Viagra. Then, she thought, she might just write it all down for her sons, Brandon and Dylan Lee, who are now grown and living in Los Angeles. But eventually -- at the urging of her elder son, Brandon, the unofficial keeper of his mom's legacy ("I work for him," she jokes) -- she decided to publish it, really publish it, in memoir form. "Love, Pamela" will be released this month, in tandem with a Netflix documentary co-produced by Brandon, that provides a kind of visual accompaniment.
The book is a mix of narrative and poetry (yes, Pamela Anderson writes poetry), a chronology of her life "beginning to end, my first memory to my last" that she hopes will, if not exactly set the record straight (she is hesitant to use that phrasing), just explain her to a world that has long assumed it already understood her.
If you grew up thinking Ms. Anderson had an upbringing as sun-kissed as her hair, you would be wrong. She grew up poor, with a violent father she says has softened in his older age and a mother who tried to leave him more than once but always returned. Her childhood was at times "unbearable," she writes, checkered by abuse: She writes that she was molested by a babysitter she eventually stood up to, telling her she hoped she died -- only to learn, not long after, that the girl died in a car accident. She couldn't tell her parents, she writes, because then they'd know "that I'd killed her with my magical mind."
Her first sexual experience with a man, at around age 13, was with someone more than a decade her senior and ended in rape. She had a high school boyfriend who once kicked her out of a moving car and another who let his friends assault her in a back seat. "I didn't tell anybody," she writes. "I just blocked it out."
Ms. Anderson was working in a tanning salon when she was discovered in her early 20s at a local football game: the Jumbotron panned to a fresh-faced brunette in a Labatt's beer T-shirt, and the company promptly hired her as a spokesmodel. Playboy quickly came calling; it wanted her for a photo shoot in Los Angeles, and fast.
She decided to do it in part to defy her fiancé at the time, who forbade it. (That same guy, she writes, once told her she was "too sexual to be trusted" -- while having an affair.) She threw up during the first photo shoot, after a makeup artist touched her breast. "I couldn't believe a woman had touched me there, I just couldn't," she writes. She would go on to pose for more covers of Playboy than anyone else in the magazine's history, including its last nude issue, published in 2015, in which she wore nothing but a gold choker spelling "sex."
That Pamela Anderson, hypersexualized creature, was the subject of sexual trauma is not coincidental, of course. She writes that learning to see herself as sexual was how she took back some control. "It was my choice," she writes of her decision to pose nude. But it also "gave some people the impetus, sadly, to treat me without respect."
Ms. Anderson parlayed Playboy into bit acting roles, like Lisa the "Tool Time" girl on "Home Improvement." But it was playing the lifeguard C.J. Parker on "Baywatch" that truly imprinted Ms. Anderson onto the cultural memory. "Baywatch" was one of the most widely distributed shows in history, and many of its international deals had Pamela clauses to ensure she would appear in them, she writes. Soon came the products: Baywatch Barbie, a Pammy-Cola. Her face and body appeared on trading cards, prepaid phone cards, stickers and blow-up pool floats. "I've had so many people tell me, like, 'I just wish I could bottle you up and sell you,"' she tells me. "It's like, I'm not a thing."
Even before the sex tape, "Pamela Anderson" was among the most searched terms on the internet. By 2000, Guinness World Records had named her the "most downloaded star" of all time. (It sent her a plaque, she says.)
She made little on those offshoots, of course. At the time she negotiated her contract with "Baywatch," she said, she had no agent and no management; she'd hardly heard terms like "syndication" and "merchandising rights," let alone knew how to negotiate for them. "I was a little girl from Canada coming here and running on a beach. Like, how would you think that would make any money?"
Sex tape or no sex tape, there was not much variation to the Pamela Anderson brand from that point forward. She had been a babe with tools, then a babe on a beach. She'd go on to play a babe who was a bounty hunter ("Barb Wire"), a babe mistaken for a bodyguard ("V.I.P."), a babe who works in a bookstore ("Stacked" -- get it?), one of two blond babes in a film called "Blonde and Blonder" and a babe playing herself, the American obsession of a Kazakh reporter named Borat.
But she was also in on the joke, at least to a point -- undressing on "S.N.L." to overcome her stage fright; marking off her body parts like slabs of meat for PETA; embodying the role of an animated cartoon in "Stripperella," created by the Marvel legend Stan Lee, about a superheroine who could cut glass with her nipples. (He wanted to make the cartoon nude. Ms. Anderson said no.) "My breasts have a career," she once joked in Esquire. "I'm just tagging along."
Sure, she has things she wishes she could do over. The breasts (implanted, then deflated, then implanted again -- "a vicious cycle," she writes), the marriages (a handful of them, to men who seem to "progressively get worse," she jokes), the bad career choices (reality TV), worse financial decisions (including a hefty tax debt), leading to even worse career choices ("Dancing With the Stars"). But that's not the same as having regrets. "I guess the sex symbol-y thing is part of what people think of me," she says. "And it's not like I'm trying to change it."
It's just that if anyone is going to tell the story of Pamela Anderson's life in 2023, it's going to be her.
'I'm not a damsel in distress'
There was a certain dance that we expected from women who made a living, in part, off being beautiful in the 1990s (or maybe that we have always expected from sex symbols). We expected to talk about their bodies in front of them and have them laugh along. We expected them to embody perfection but resented them for conforming to an unattainable ideal. We expected them to have higher aspirations -- but sneered at any suggestion that they could.
Ms. Anderson, for the most part, did this dance effortlessly: She was grateful for the hand she was dealt, happy for the opportunity, humbled by her sliver of success, even if she never had the chance to "really show what I am capable of," she says.
But now there is a new dance we expect, often from these same women: If they're among those who, in the past, were treated particularly unkindly -- those for whom there was a sex tape, a conservatorship, an affair, a drug overdose -- we offer them redemption, in exchange for their publicly living through it all again.
Pamela Anderson does not want to do this dance.
She is telling her story, yes, and that story may confirm many of the things people assumed about her. But in the years since that tape was released, she also didn't collapse. She raised two sons, who are her staunchest defenders. She has designed vegan accessories, published a series of novels, co-wrote a book of relationship advice, produced a documentary about meat, started a foundation and became something of an art muse.
Last year she made her debut on Broadway in "Chicago," playing the role of the misunderstood seductress Roxie Hart -- a character with whom she said she felt a particular kinship. Her performance was surprisingly well received. But that's the thing about that whole dumb blonde trope, Ms. Anderson says wryly: "I can only surprise people."
For years, she says, she resisted offers to do projects about her life, unconvinced anyone needed to hear from her, content with her mark on the culture without wanting to challenge it. She isn't after validation or affirmation and is not particularly concerned about her legacy.
But the book, she says, stirred something primal in her. She says it's the first thing in her life over which she has had complete control -- down to the copy edits, which she insisted on transferring into the manuscript herself -- and losing that control was not an option. "It really was life or death," she says. "I felt I need to tell my story. And I really couldn't let anybody do it but me."
We forget sometimes, when we talk about the idea of agency, that it's as much about the stories we tell ourselves as it is about the actions we take. It's not just about what happened to us; it's about the role we feel we played in what happened. It's the difference between posing for Playboy and a stolen sex tape. It's why hearing someone recount your life to you can make you feel sick, while telling your own story, in your own words, can feel like a matter of survival.
In the trailer for "Pamela, a Love Story," Ms. Anderson and her son Brandon present through a series of clips how she was exploited, lost control of her image, had to make a career out of the pieces left. But the trailer is ultimately defiant.
"I'm not the damsel in distress," a barefaced Ms. Anderson declares at one point, then suggests she'll do all the interviews naked.
The tone, as always, with Pamela Anderson, is light and charming, but the message is clear: You spent years gawking at me, drooling over me, reducing me to a punchline. Don't you dare feel good about yourselves for rescuing me now.

The Enduring Power of Blond: [Op-Ed]

Full text: If you are ever trapped between a hungry bear and a blonde with an attitude, fight the bear.
That was my lesson over the holiday break.
I took a few weeks off into the new year to fight pneumonia and prepare for the semester. Complete bed rest meant that my administrative work fell by the wayside. Instead, I zoned out to "Masterpiece Theater," browsed through the stack of magazines I had collected during busier times and occasionally logged into social media.
That's how I ended up running afoul of the Blondes.
You see, part of my convalescence involved watching TikTok videos, or TikToks. The app's users skew younger than me, and yet I joined last summer, in part, because I teach a graduate seminar called "Social Problems in the Information Society." TikTok's algorithm makes it easy to love. It ruthlessly surfaces the latent constructs of our personalities. We may say we are serious people who want to consume content about ancient Mesopotamia, but how we actually allocate our attention reveals that we want cats, a little soft-core porn and more cats. My TikTok algorithm served up a lot of middle-aged women playing with fashion and experts explaining their niche subject area.
That's how I found myself stitching a TikTok about blondes. I'd come across a video of a young white American woman with brassy white blond highlights and dark brown roots. A commenter had accused the content creator of being a brunette. To refute the accusation, the young woman asked her mother whether she was a "natural brunette." "No, you were born blond," the mother responded.
Give yourself 100 points if you picked up that the mother answered a different question than the one the daughter had asked. I picked up on it immediately, and using the instant editing magic of stitching, a feature that allows TikTokers to build on or respond to content across the site, I responded.
My reply described the humorous video as an example of a multiyear project I have been working on about "blonde" as a racial signifier. We use "blonde" (and if to a lesser extent "brunette") to signal that someone is white without using a racialized term like "white." It may also be more -- a signifier of a type of white person. When the daughter with visibly brown roots insists that having blond hair as a child makes her a natural blonde, she is saying something I have heard countless people say. I have always been puzzled by it.
What could be so important about a genetic trait that someone would use it to describe herself long after the trait's phenotypic expression -- light hair -- no longer exists? It makes literal sense only if by blonde she is referring to something more than hair. Being a natural blonde must confer honor, esteem and power to those who can legitimately claim it. Guess how we define social status? It is as a role or identity that confers honor, esteem and power to those who legitimately hold it.
I told my modest 15,600 or so followers that we would return to the subject. As far as public scholarship goes, this was casual and low-key. It was also part of my oeuvre. My first public essay to go viral (well, what passed for viral then) was published in 2013, when I wrote about Miley Cyrus doing a sexually provocative number with Black female backup dancers at an awards show. That would not generate a lot of attention today, but in 2013, Cyrus was a few years from her Disney tenure. I wrote about how Cyrus played with race and performance and gender to signify danger. That essay started a decade-long thread about race and beauty that takes both seriously as political, economic and cultural work that we all do, usually without thinking about how we do it. I have written about the power of everyday aesthetics, Dolly Parton and political fashion. A breezy TikTok was a no-brainer.
Over two days, angry self-proclaimed blondes messaged me, stitched me and replied to me. A popular TikTok account appears to have encouraged its followers to report me en masse, a common online tactic called swarming.
I knew a lot of the anger had to do with my critics' being Extremely Online, a condition where social media compels us to read thinly, strip out all context and get to the part where we can be insulted as efficiently as possible. But that doesn't explain their visceral reaction to my idea that blonde is a social status. Commenters complained that their blond children are simply prettier with light hair -- and they characterized their adulation as a natural, understandable obsession with youth. People who were born blond and now have dark hair were among the angriest. They insisted that being a "natural blonde" should matter more than their actual hair color. When pushed on what makes that matter, they got even angrier.
People often get angry when I write about aesthetics and power. Most of us hate the idea that whom we are attracted to, for instance, has any political context. We hate thinking that the things we enjoy -- like a soapy western with conservative tropes -- mean anything. That is the thing about status. We all want it, but, should we acquire it, we don't want it to mean anything. We don't want to feel bad about having status. The real blondes let me have it because, they maintained, being blond should mean something for them but not mean anything for the rest of us. That is not how status works.
I was banned two days after my video had almost one million views.
Being banned from a major social media platform for more than a week stung a bit. Then it mellowed into pride. I've never been banned before! It's heady stuff for a kid who spent her entire youth waiting to be offered illegal drugs at a party only to discover that I kind of look like a narc.
I wear the banning proudly, but I contest my humiliating defeat at the hands of angry blondes. I don't protest out of pride but from intellectual seriousness. We talk a lot about race and class and gender in this country. Although we don't talk about it particularly well, the U.S. public discourse on race and its associated inequalities is comparatively sophisticated. You only have to look at the Meghan Markle debacle in Britain to see that we aren't the absolute worst at this.
When people have outsize emotional reactions to benign inquiries about their self-evident beliefs, it is often an indicator that status is doing invisible work. That makes the culture, economics and politics of blondness great ways to think about how status derives its power and how we use that power in our own lives. Now we're having a conversation about the real meaning of blonde that builds on research. "Racism Without Racists" by Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, a sociologist at Duke, is a classic study on the discursive strategies we use to talk about race without talking directly about race. The book informs my thinking about euphemisms for race and status.
Bonilla-Silva argues that white people have an in-group language to talk about racial categories, just as all groups do. We may use "citizen" or "taxpayer" or "American" to talk about dominant racial groups, which, in the American case, means white. We also use "blonde" not just to construct meaning about whiteness but also to describe how it is achieved and maintained. Sometimes our usage is also about gender and class and the status behaviors people develop to be legible as members of the dominant group. I'd bet that if you envisioned a blonde at any point while reading this, the woman you pictured looks more like Reese Witherspoon than Beyoncé. The tricky thing about status is that the specter of race is always close at hand.
Blond is the physical expression or phenotype of a genetic trait. The idea can be presented as a noun ("blond" for male, "blonde" for female) or an adjective ("blond"). Parents celebrate when a baby is born blond and cry if the child grows out of it. Some research finds that blondes make more money than brunettes (that might explain why they have more fun). The blonde stereotype I'm thinking of is a modern invention of advertising and pop culture. The sociopolitical meaning of blonde as genetically superior, desirable is much older and more sinister. Many cultures have a language to describe "blond" but it does not always describe light hair. Sometimes it describes skin shade or economic capital. That is the case in Spanish, where "rubia" can mean more than light hair.
Ambitions to be a blonde, and sorrow for not "winning" this "genetic lottery," are global. Readers from Spain, Italy, Brazil, South Korea and Sweden wrote to me about their different yet intertwining beliefs about blondness. They shared deeply personal comments on Instagram, Twitter, my university and public email addresses -- anywhere they could find me, really. They wanted me to know how much not being blond has affected their lives. Some mentioned heartbroken grandparents who mourn darkening hair on a young child. Another remembered being a dark-haired Jewish child who concluded that she could never be good enough. There was the woman who used blondness to buffer fat bias. There is a lot of loss wrapped up in blonde's status. Maybe that is why staying blond is so expensive. The process can also be painful. Yet, a vast majority of the world's blondes are that way because of chemical intervention.
I may need to convince you that unpacking what blonde means as a social status is worth your consideration. I am up for the task. It helps that I'm bringing a gang. I will be talking with writers, anthropologists, economists and readers about what blonde means. They can help us understand the class distinctions people make about people who achieve blonde from $ 10 at-home kits versus those who pay $ 1,500 for it. They can also help us make sense of why so many women in conservative media are also blondes.
We all play status games, and they always cost something. It may be uncomfortable at times, but to paraphrase what L'Oreal's old advertising campaign for hair dye tells us, it's "because you're worth it."

Full text: At a Brooklyn club, fans of the Netflix series "Wednesday" showed off their takes on the pigtailed heroine's signature moves in a midnight competition.
On a Brooklyn street dotted with auto repair garages, a line of young women wearing black ruffled dresses, black chokers, little black backpacks and Doc Martens waited in the cold outside a club called Quantum on Friday night. They were united in their fandom for the Netflix series "Wednesday" and their adoration for the show's macabre protagonist, Wednesday Addams.
The club, which is beside the Gowanus Expressway, was hosting an Addams Family-themed party dedicated to the dance that Wednesday performs in the show's fourth episode at a prom-like event at Nevermore Academy, a boarding school for outcasts, vampires and werewolves. The angular dance is characterized by unpredictable arm flails and head jerks, and executed to the 1981 psychobilly classic "Goo Goo Muck," by the Cramps. It has inspired endless fans to post bedroom tributes on TikTok.
Jenna Ortega, the 20-year-old former Disney star who plays Wednesday, choreographed the moves herself by studying footage of goths dancing at clubs in the 1980s and borrowing ideas from performers like Bob Fosse, Siouxsie Sioux, Lene Lovich and Denis Lavant.
She has also cited the gyrations of Lisa Loring, who played Wednesday in the 1960s TV series "The Addams Family." The New York Times dance critic Gia Kourlas has written of Ortega's performance: "It's the defiant dance of a nonconformist. It's a celebration of weird."
As the club filled up with Wednesdays, there was a sense of anticipation in the crowd: At midnight, on an elevated runway, there would be a contest to determine which Wednesday had mastered the dance best.
A big screen behind the D.J. booth showed clips of the old black-and-white TV series, the Addams Family movies from the 1990s and the Netflix show. The event's organizer (an outfit called Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger Presents) had promoted the party with a program that promised a playlist of "sad girl bops," which ended up meaning songs by Lana Del Rey and My Chemical Romance. On the stage, the hip-hop artist Sl!ck performed a Wednesday-inspired rap.
The Quantum dance floor became a fashion runway for all manner of Wednesday Addams costume interpretations: outfits featured black-and-white socks, polka dot shirts, leather coats, metal skull earrings, thick-soled boots with silver spider buckles and brothel creepers. But there were a few spots of color in the crowd, in the form of fans dressed as Enid Sinclair, Wednesday's jovial roommate, who wears floral skirts, pink sweaters and berets.
Between dances, fans reflected on Ms. Ortega's performance, as well as why a character conceived in the 1930s by the New Yorker cartoonist Charles Addams is now thriving as a mascot for the weird almost 90 years later.
"What Wednesday's dance represents is that it's not about trying to prove you're different," said Melanie Allen-Harrison, 32, who wore a dark baggy coat and a silver pendant necklace. "It's about knowing that you are and owning that."
Ariella Van Cooten, 31, a middle-school teacher who had dyed her hair pink and green, said: "Now it's cool to be goth because of the show. People used to look at me funny because I shopped at Hot Topic." She added, "I think Wednesday has endured as a character because she's not afraid to be bold, even if that means drinking poison."
The D.J., Cip Cipriano, who wore a Wednesday Addams muscle shirt, said: "I was a gay guido from Yonkers who had to move to San Francisco. We're drawn to Wednesday because so many of us know what it feels like to be an outcast. And not only is Wednesday a black sheep, she's the black sheep of the Addams Family."
Finally, midnight arrived, and the Wednesday dance contest was at hand.
Six contestants climbed onto the stage. The reverb guitar twang of "Goo Goo Muck" began to thunder through the club's loudspeakers. As the crowd cheered, the contestants mimicked Ms. Ortega's moves while imitating her character's signature cold stare.
In the final round, water guns were given to audience members so that they could douse the contestants in red paint -- a homage to the scene following Ms. Ortega's dance, in which some local teenagers stage a cruel prank on the Nevermore students by pumping a blood-like liquid into the school's sprinkler system.
The winner was picked democratically: whoever received the loudest applause. It was Jeffrey Pelayo, a 23-year-old fashion stylist who had dressed up as Wednesday's father, Gomez Addams. He was wearing a blazer and tie, and his smudged pencil mustache was drawn in mascara. He was given a tiara and a drink ticket as his prize.
As night waned into early morning at the club, the Wednesday crowd began to thin out and the staff diverted its attention to customers who wanted to slam shots and party to hits by Kesha and Katy Perry. The dance floor, in other words, turned into the kind of scene that Wednesday Addams would despise. Bombarding the stage, a gang of college girls screamed along to the lyrics of Rihanna's "We Found Love" while a couple of guys loitered at the bar building up their liquid courage.
And yet, as the club devolved into a fratty spectacle, a pair of last-call Wednesdays were dancing hard in a dark corner of the floor, stomping their boots and moshing around in circles, their little black backpacks bobbing up and down. They moved with defiance, dancing strangely without a care.

A Founder of Netflix Cedes the Role of Co-Chief: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Mr. Hastings will become the streaming giant's executive chairman. Greg Peters will join Ted Sarandos as a co-chief executive.
Reed Hastings, one of the founders of Netflix, has helmed the company since before it was a streaming service, when its business model revolved around sending DVDs through the mail.
Now, after spending a quarter-century building Netflix into the world's first major streaming company -- and dragging the rest of the media industry with him -- Mr. Hastings said Thursday that he was ceding his co-chief executive title and becoming the company's executive chairman.
In his place, Netflix is appointing Greg Peters, the company's chief product and chief operating officer, to join Ted Sarandos as a co-chief executive. Mr. Sarandos has been in the role since 2020.
Mr. Hastings, 62, said the executive reorganization was part of a long-in-the-making succession plan. In announcing the move, he pointed to Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos as other company founders who moved into chairman roles "after they pass the baton to others."
"In the last two and a half years, I've increasingly delegated the management of Netflix to them," Mr. Hastings said in a statement, noting that Mr. Sarandos and Mr. Peters have dealt with the challenges of the pandemic and upheavals in the streaming industry. He added, "The board and I believe it's the right time to complete my succession."
"I'll be helping Greg and Ted and, like any good chairman, be a bridge from the board to our co-C.E.O.s. I'll also be spending more time on philanthropy, and remain very focused on Netflix stock doing well."
Later, in a video interview for investors, Mr. Hastings said the Netflix board had begun thinking of the succession process about a decade ago. "This is acknowledging in formal terms how we've been operating at least the last few quarters," he said.
The company is also appointing Bela Bajaria, its global head of television, chief content officer and naming Scott Stuber, its global head of film, chairman of Netflix Film, a new role.
"We've all learned so much from his intellectual rigor, honesty and willingness to take big bets -- and we look forward to working with him for many more years to come," Mr. Sarandos said of Mr. Hastings. "Since Reed started to delegate management to us, Greg and I have built a strong operating model based on our shared values and like-minded approach to growth."
The news regarding Mr. Hastings accompanied Netflix's fourth-quarter earnings announcement. The company said it had added 7.7 million subscribers -- well past its forecast of about 4.5 million -- crediting the influx of new users to strong fourth-quarter programming.
Netflix now has more than 231 million subscribers worldwide, it said. That means that Netflix ended 2022 with more subscribers than it started the year with, despite a disappointing first six months, when it lost more than a million subscribers.
Netflix generated about $ 7.85 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter, a nearly 2 percent increase from a year earlier. The company generated about $ 55 million in profit, a 90 percent decrease from a year earlier.
Netflix's share price went up more than 6 percent in after-hours trading.
In a letter to shareholders, Netflix said its advertising-supported subscription had resulted in subscriber growth and increased customer engagement. The company said that relatively few of its customers had switched from other plans, and that both customers and advertisers had been bullish on the option.
Netflix did not provide any guidance for new subscriber additions in the first quarter of 2023, after an announcement last year that it would stop providing those closely watched updates to investors. As Netflix's streaming business has matured, investors and analysts have focused more on revenue growth and profit. But the company said it expected revenue to increase 4 percent in the quarter, with subscriber growth higher in the second quarter of this year compared to the first.
Netflix, which is famous for citing sleep as one of its biggest competitors, acknowledged in its letter that it faces competition from streaming competitors in addition to emerging platforms like TikTok. It also cited traditional television, YouTube and video games as other rivals for potential customers.
Netflix's advertising tier, priced at $ 6.99 a month in the United States, was a major reversal for the streaming company, whose executives -- Mr. Hastings chief among them -- had long insisted that they didn't believe ads were right for the company. But the plan, which debuted in November, has been popular with investors who were spooked by the company's earlier subscriber losses.
On Wednesday, Netflix announced that its 2023 film slate would feature 49 movies, including animated and foreign-language films. That is down from 2022, when the company's ambitions to release a film a week resulted in 61 English-language, live action titles; five animated features; three anime films; and 17 live-action movies in other languages.
Highlights for 2023 include a David Fincher thriller, "The Killer," starring Michael Fassbender; Zack Snyder's sci-fi epic "Rebel Moon"; and David Yates's "Pain Hustlers," starring Emily Blunt, which the company bought out of the Cannes Film Festival last year for a reported $ 50 million. Netflix is also making good on its intent to franchise its content with second iterations of "Murder Mystery" and "Extraction" also set to debut in 2023.
Netflix, which was once unchallenged in the video-streaming market, has faced increased competition from deep-pocketed rivals like Disney, Comcast and Warner Bros. Discovery, companies that it used to rely on for programming. That competition, combined with an increasingly saturated U.S. market, has encouraged Netflix to seek subscribers in international markets, crack down on password-sharing and introduce its advertising plan.
In its letter to shareholders, Netflix said it hoped to increase its subscribers through new initiatives like "paid sharing," which allows subscribers to add users to accounts for an additional fee.
Netflix also cited the success of its recent programs, including the series "Wednesday" and "Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery," a movie that it screened in a limited number of theaters in the United States before its debut on Netflix. In its last quarter, Netflix also began streaming "The Pale Blue Eyes," a period-piece detective mystery starring Christian Bale and Harry Melling.
Mr. Hastings, who had already successfully founded a company called Pure Software, helped found Netflix in 1997 with Marc Randolph as a movie rental-by-mail service. The two put in place a corporate culture of "radical honesty" to the extent that in 1998, Mr. Hastings made a PowerPoint presentation to Mr. Randolph detailing the reasons he was no longer fit to remain chief executive.
Since then, Mr. Hastings has been instrumental in the company's shift to streaming. Though Mr. Hastings often repeated the line "No advertising coming onto Netflix. Period," it eventually came to pass.
The one real black mark on Mr. Hastings's record was Qwikster, the short-lived DVD portion of the business that Netflix created to differentiate it from the streaming offering. It lasted just one month after one million subscribers left the service, unhappy with the price increase that came from splitting the service into two pieces.
In late 2018, Netflix was criticized for pulling an episode of the comedy show "Patriot Act," starring Hasan Minhaj, from its Saudi Arabia feed because it was critical of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and ran afoul of Saudi censors. Mr. Hastings responded by saying: "We're not trying to do truth to power. We're trying to entertain."
In 2021, the company stood by the comedian Dave Chappelle when critics inside and outside the company said his stand-up special promoted bigotry against transgender people. A number of employees participated in a walkout to protest Netflix's decision to leave the content on the site.

Predicting The Oscar Nominees: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: It's an unusually wide open year for the Academy Awards. But our expert has a good idea about what will make the cut. Here are his projections.
When it comes to the Oscar nominations, which will be announced on Tuesday, I would advise you to expect the unexpected: This is an unusually fluid awards season, and most of the top categories still feel up for grabs.
(Well, all the top categories except for the supporting actor race. But who won't be excited to watch the "Everything Everywhere All at Once" star Ke Huy Quan win that one in a walk?)
Still, as your Projectionist, it's my job to at least give you a hint of the unexpected, so with that in mind, here are my projections for the nominations in the top six Oscar categories, gleaned from industry chatter, the televised boosts offered by the Golden Globes and Critics Choice Awards, and the recent nominations from the Screen Actors Guild, Producers Guild of America and Directors Guild of America.
Best Picture
Three films have been nominated by the producers, directors and actors guilds -- "Everything Everywhere All at Once," "The Fabelmans" and "The Banshees of Inisherin" -- and each has won a televised award for best film, too. Those are your front-runners in a category that recently expanded to 10 guaranteed slots, followed closely by "Tár," the intellectual favorite, and "Top Gun: Maverick," the popcorn pick.
The next two slots should go to two box-office success stories: "Elvis," the rare adult drama to make a killing last year, and "Avatar: The Way of Water," which has put up eye-popping numbers all through the Oscar-voting period and is poised to pass $ 2 billion worldwide.
What about another huge sequel, "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever," which made the producers' lineup, and the epic-scaled "RRR" and "The Woman King," both of which that guild snubbed? ABC executives would be thrilled if the telecast could tout those crowd-pleasers, but the expanded best picture lineup has never been dominated by so many action-driven blockbusters. (And I'd have more faith in "Wakanda Forever" if the Screen Actors Guild, which gave the first "Black Panther" its top film prize, had nominated this sequel in the same category.)
The best actor winner almost always hails from a film nominated for best picture, so if you think a resurgent Brendan Fraser could go all the way this year, then expect a nod here for "The Whale," which cast him in a transformative role as a 600-pound recluse. And though Netflix has been pushing "Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery," it's the streamer's German-language "All Quiet on the Western Front" that most resonates with the voters I've spoken to.
There's still a shot that the Sarah Polley-directed "Women Talking," which received a SAG ensemble nomination, or the British fave "Aftersun" could show up here. But I'm predicting the final slot goes to the class-warfare comedy "Triangle of Sadness," which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, just as another social satire, "Parasite," did four years ago.
Best Director
Last year, four of the five people nominated by the Directors Guild also went on to receive an Oscar nomination, and I expect that crystal ball to prove just as predictive this time around. The safest contenders appear to be Steven Spielberg, whose ninth Oscar nomination would tie him with Martin Scorsese for the second-most best director nominations ever, behind William Wyler's 13; Todd Field for "Tár; and Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan, who directed "Everything Everywhere All at Once" and will be the first duo nominated in this category since Joel and Ethan Coen for 2010's "True Grit."
Martin McDonagh failed to make the best director lineup for his Oscar-winning "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri," a reminder that dialogue-driven comedies aren't always showy enough for this branch. Still, I expect that his new film, "The Banshees of Inisherin," where the conversations are punctuated by some stunning scenery, will finally earn him entry into this race.
I'd be a bit surprised if the fifth D.G.A. pick, the "Top Gun: Maverick" director Joseph Kosinski, makes it in: The film is well-made, but it lacks an auteurist stamp. "Avatar: The Way of Water" could only have been directed by James Cameron, but voters will probably wait until his franchise concludes to honor him. And though there are worthy women who ought to be contenders in this category -- among them, Gina Prince-Bythewood ("The Woman King"), Sarah Polley ("Women Talking") and Charlotte Wells ("Aftersun") -- their films aren't assured of making the best picture lineup.
There could be a surprise from the international film community here, as this branch has recently sprung for the likes of Ryusuke Hamaguchi and Thomas Vinterberg. But I'm betting on a big name, the Australian auteur Baz Luhrmann ("Elvis"), who has embraced the awards-season campaign trail with zeal.
Best Actor
This front-loaded race boasts four contenders that pull from some of the academy's most favored archetypes. You've got a makeup-aided comeback performance (Brendan Fraser in "The Whale"), a movie star proving there's more to him than people might have suspected (Colin Farrell in "Banshees"), a singing, strutting biopic performer (Austin Butler in "Elvis") and a well-regarded but oft-overlooked veteran (Bill Nighy in "Living").
After that, there are no guarantees. Though "Top Gun: Maverick" will rack up mentions in other categories, when academy voters consider nominating a Tom Cruise performance, they want to see him stretch. Other big stars in contention all have significant drawbacks: Hugh Jackman ("The Son") leads a film that was critically savaged, Tom Hanks scored a heartland hit ("A Man Called Otto") that coastal voters aren't watching, and Will Smith ("Emancipation") ... well, you know.
Occasionally, you'll see someone in the best actor category whose film doesn't factor into any other race, but that party crasher is usually a well-respected veteran -- a Denzel, a Willem, a Viggo -- and not Adam Sandler, whose SAG nomination for the basketball drama "Hustle" may be all he can muster. So I'm projecting that our fifth nominee will be Paul Mescal, whose acclaimed "Aftersun" is at least in best picture contention, and whose rising-star trajectory (after his breakthrough in the limited series "Normal People") is something the academy will be keen to get in on.
Best Actress
The duel between the "Tár" star Cate Blanchett and the "Everything Everywhere" actress Michelle Yeoh will almost certainly be Oscar night's most suspenseful contest. But in the meantime, who will keep the two of them company in this category?
Like Blanchett and Yeoh, Viola Davis of "The Woman King" was nominated by the Screen Actors Guild, the Golden Globes and the Critics Choice Awards, so she should have a safe berth here. The other two slots are harder to call. Ana de Armas managed a SAG nomination for playing Marilyn Monroe in "Blonde," but the movie is polarizing. And as Oscar voting began, a raft of famous names suddenly took to social media to tout Andrea Riseborough's performance as a struggling alcoholic in "To Leslie," though it's unclear whether that grass-roots campaign will move the underseen indie to the front of voters' queues.
I think one of the remaining slots will go to the "Till" star Danielle Deadwyler, who won the Gotham Award for her lead performance, a victory tempered by surprise snubs from the Independent Spirit Awards and Golden Globes. Finally, reserve a spot for the "Fabelmans" star Michelle Williams: Though SAG omitted her, I think that headline-making snub will actually remind people to vote for her, as it did last year with Kristen Stewart for "Spencer."
Best Supporting Actor
Three of the last five supporting actor races have featured a pair of nominees competing from the same film. Could this year offer two such duos?
Both Brendan Gleeson and Barry Keoghan from "Banshees" ought to make the cut: It's Gleeson's gruffness that sets the plot in motion, and Keoghan's tragic fool that makes you laugh, then weep. "The Fabelmans" also has a well-liked pair of contenders in Paul Dano, who plays the introverted father of our young Spielberg stand-in, and Judd Hirsch, cast as his rambunctious great-uncle. Gleeson, Keoghan and Dano were all nominated by the screen actors, and though the 87-year-old Hirsch missed there, I suspect option-addled Oscar voters will default to a few key titles and nominate as many people as they can from them, as Emmy voters recently have.
Who else may be chosen as an eventual runner-up to the "Everything Everywhere" star Ke Huy Quan, the comeback kid who has dominated this awards season and will cruise to an easy Oscar victory? Eddie Redmayne (SAG-nominated for "The Good Nurse") and Brian Tyree Henry ("Causeway") could make it in, though their movies are hardly juggernauts. Tom Hanks ("Elvis") and Brad Pitt ("Babylon") are Oscar-winning veterans in higher-profile films, but Hanks was critically derided and "Babylon" bombed.
If there is a surprise late entry, I'd look to Ben Whishaw, who offers sensitive support to the female ensemble in "Women Talking," or Woody Harrelson as a Marxist cruise captain in "Triangle of Sadness," who could show up here if the movie overperforms.
Best Supporting Actress
All hail the queen: Angela Bassett has already won televised trophies at the Golden Globes and Critics Choice Awards for playing a grief-stricken monarch in "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever." Though comic-book actors usually have to don Joker greasepaint if they want Oscar voters to pay attention, it's well past time for Bassett to earn her second Oscar nomination, since her first came all the way back in 1994 for "What's Love Got to Do With It." The 64-year-old Bassett has been too good for too long, and the academy would err by curtailing her moment.
Do we have room in this race for another duo? Earlier in the season, it looked like Claire Foy and Jessie Buckley from "Women Talking" would be that pair, but the Screen Actors Guild failed to nominate either, despite liking the movie enough to give it an ensemble nod. Instead, the "Everything Everywhere" co-stars Jamie Lee Curtis and Stephanie Hsu both made the SAG shortlist and ought to repeat here: Curtis is a veteran actress campaigning hard for her first nomination, while Hsu, who impresses in a tricky dual role, is peaking at just the right time.
That's one film with a quartet of likely nominees in its cast. Another is "Banshees," which will almost certainly earn its fourth acting nomination, for Kerry Condon as Farrell's feisty sister. But the fifth supporting actress slot could go to any number of women, including Dolly de Leon, whose cruise-ship cleaner comes to the fore late in "Triangle of Sadness," and Janelle Monáe, who's terrific in "Glass Onion" but must gun for an acting nomination that even the first "Knives Out" didn't manage.
When in doubt, let's default to archetypes. This category frequently makes room for what I'll dub the Patient Partner, someone who offers supportive ballast to a dominant, tricky lead character (even if that support and patience is sorely tested). This race offers two such contenders: Nina Hoss, whose loaded glances to Blanchett say so much in "Tár," and the SAG nominee Hong Chau, who shines in "The Whale" as Fraser's caregiver. Chau also had a scene-stealing turn in this season's culinary horror-comedy "The Menu," and taken together, they are evidence of an expansive taste in roles that I project will give her the edge.

'A Man Called Otto' Strikes a Chord in Middle America: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Ticket sales totaled $ 15 million over the holiday weekend, fueled by older audiences in the middle of the country.
A nearly extinct species of theatrical movie -- a conventional drama aimed at older ticket buyers in the middle of the country -- sent a reminder to Hollywood over the weekend: If you build it (properly), they will come.
"A Man Called Otto," starring Tom Hanks as a cranky widower, will collect roughly $ 15 million over the four-day holiday weekend in the United States, for a total of $ 21 million since opening in limited release on Dec. 20, according to Comscore. That kind of sturdy debut has recently escaped pedigreed dramas like "Babylon," "She Said," "Amsterdam," "Till" and "The Fabelmans," leading to worries about the viability of dramas in theaters.
For the most part, these films have been aimed at audiences on the coasts. "A Man Called Otto," however, was marketed toward heartland audiences. Crowds came out in places like Detroit, Minneapolis, Denver and Salt Lake City, box office analysts said. None of the top 75 theaters for the film were located in Los Angeles or New York, which is very unusual.
Ticket sales were "particularly vibrant in small-town theaters," according to Sony Pictures Entertainment, which released the PG-13 film. About 60 percent of ticket buyers were female, and 46 percent of attendees were over the age of 55, Sony said. "A Man Called Otto" received warm reviews (68 percent positive, according to Rotten Tomatoes), with the obviousness of the plot the primary complaint. But ticket buyers loved it, as evidenced by a 96 percent positive audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
"The audience for original adult films will absolutely return to theaters, if we don't forget them," Tom Rothman, the chairman of the Sony Motion Picture Group, said in an email. "And if you are able to strike a chord in Middle America, it can be especially strong." "A Man Called Otto" took in 50 percent more than the $ 10 million that analysts predicted going into the weekend.
"A Man Called Otto" cost about $ 50 million to make (not including marketing expenses), with financing shared by TSG Entertainment and SF Studios, a Swedish film and television company. A remake of a Swedish film and based on a best-selling novel called "A Man Called Ove," it is the heartstring-tugging story of a depressed widower who finds himself in an unusual friendship with a new neighbor. Hanks co-stars with Mariana Treviño and a cat named Smeagol. The movie was directed by Marc Forster, who is known for "Finding Neverland" and "Quantum of Solace."
The top movies at the North American box office over the weekend were wide-release holdovers. In first place, "Avatar: The Way of Water" (Disney) collected about $ 38.5 million between Friday and Monday, for a five-week total of $ 563 million ( $ 1.9 billion worldwide). "M3gan," a horror comedy from Universal, ranked second, with estimated ticket sales of $ 21.2 million, for a two-week total of $ 60 million ( $ 91 million worldwide).

Plotting Openly, Rioters in Brazil Breached Security With Ease: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: As the bus made its way from Brazil's agricultural heartland to the capital, Andrea Barth pulled out her phone to ask fellow passengers, one by one, what they intended to do once they arrived.
"Overthrow the thieves," one man replied.
"Take out 'Nine-Finger,"' said another, referring to Brazil's leftist president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who lost part of a finger decades ago in a factory accident.
"You might escape a lightning strike," another man said, as if confronting Mr. Lula himself. "But you won't escape me."
As the passengers described their plans for violence, more than a hundred other buses bulging with supporters of Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right former president, were also descending on Brasília, the capital.
A day later, on Jan. 8, a pro-Bolsonaro mob unleashed mayhem that shocked the country and was broadcast around the world. Rioters invaded and ransacked Brazil's Congress, Supreme Court and presidential offices, intending, many of them said, to spur military leaders to topple Mr. Lula, who had taken office just a week earlier.
The chaotic attack bore an unsettling resemblance to the Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol: Hundreds of right-wing protesters, claiming an election was rigged, stomping through the halls of power.
Each episode rattled one of the world's largest democracies, and almost two years to the day after the U.S. attack, last Sunday's assault showed that far-right extremism, inspired by antidemocratic leaders and fed by conspiracy theories, remains a grave threat.
Mr. Lula and judicial authorities have moved swiftly to reassert control, arresting more than 1,150 rioters, clearing the encampments that gave them refuge, searching for their funders and organizers and, on Friday, opening an investigation into how Mr. Bolsonaro may have inspired them.
But questions continue to swirl about how a relatively small band of unarmed protesters, who had largely publicized their plans, were able so easily to storm the country's most important government buildings.
The New York Times spoke with law enforcement, government officials, witnesses and protesters, and reviewed dozens of videos and hundreds of social media posts to piece together what happened. The reporting shows that a mob, led by what appeared to be a relatively small group of extremists bent on destruction, swiftly and effortlessly overwhelmed a drastically outnumbered police presence.
It also shows that some officers not only failed to take any action against rioters, but they also appeared to be sympathetic, snapping photos as the mob tore through Congress. One man who came to see what was going on said the police simply waved him on toward the riot.
The imbalance between protesters and the police remains a central focus of the authorities' investigation, and interviews with security officials yielded accusations of gross negligence and even active complicity in the mayhem. After the riot, federal authorities suspended the governor responsible for protecting the buildings and arrested two top security officials who worked for him.
The rampage in the heart of Brazil's capital has put the nation at perhaps its most challenging political juncture since civilian leaders replaced a 21-year military dictatorship in 1985.
Brazil had weathered graft scandals and huge protests, tense elections and economic crises, presidents impeached and imprisoned. But with election deniers drawing inspiration from counterparts in the United States, the attack revealed how vulnerable Brazil's democracy is.
Many of those who carried out the assault on Brazil's democratic institutions plotted in broad daylight, announcing their plans on social media. But intelligence officials issued warnings that went unheeded.
And as federal investigators follow money trails around Brazil, it is becoming clear that business elites and Bolsonaro allies were instrumental in financing the protests that eventually turned violent.
Still, Brazil's biggest challenge could be that a sizable portion of the country has lost faith in its democracy, despite no credible evidence of electoral fraud.
While Brazil's institutions formed a united front against any attempt by Mr. Bolsonaro to challenge the election's results -- the former president has absconded to a rental home near Disney World -- his false claims about voter fraud have festered and spread across Latin America's largest nation.
The morning after the riot, interviews with a dozen protesters showed that they were far from giving up and were even moving past the man who had once led them.
"We are not here for President Bolsonaro anymore. We are here for our nation, our freedom," said Nathanael S. Viera, 51, who had driven 900 miles to fight against what he said was a Communist plot. "Our future is being stolen. You understand?"
'It Didn't Seem Serious'
On New Year's Day, Mr. Lula ascended the ramp to Brazil's presidential offices and accepted the green and gold presidential sash -- not from Mr. Bolsonaro, as the law prescribed, but from a woman who collects trash to recycle. Mr. Bolsonaro had already decamped for Florida.
For roughly half the country, it was the welcome end to four years of tumult under Mr. Bolsonaro. But for millions of other Brazilians, it was the completion of an elaborate crime -- a stolen election that they had been begging the military to overturn for two months.
Days later, calls went out across pro-Bolsonaro corners of the internet -- in tweets, TikTok videos, Telegram channels and WhatsApp groups -- for an enormous Sunday demonstration in the capital, right where Mr. Lula's supporters had celebrated a week before.
Some digital fliers promised a party, while others called for something far more serious. There were messages that demanded blocked highways and oil refineries, and others that took aim at the heart of government.
"The plan is to surround Brasília," one person wrote in a Telegram group, attaching an aerial image of Congress, the Supreme Court and the Planalto Palace, headquarters of the presidency, with each building circled.
"We need journalists from around the world to report on this moment," another person responded, "so it will become marked in Brazil's history."
Yet the plans did not appear to overly alarm the authorities.
Ricardo Cappelli, the No. 2 official at Brazil's justice ministry, said that pro-Bolsonaro rallies had long taken on conspiratorial tones but had remained largely nonviolent. "It didn't seem serious," he said, "and it wasn't big enough to be serious."
The planned protest's location -- the mile-long grassy esplanade that ends at Brazil's Congress -- has been the choice spot for Brazilians to vent their frustration for decades, sometimes with crowds in the hundreds of thousands.
Intelligence suggested that Sunday's turnout would be just a few thousand.
While the esplanade is lined with the federal government's most important buildings, a different entity has long handled security of demonstrations there: the district government that oversees Brasília.
The federal government pays the district $ 2 billion each year to provide security, and had been satisfied with the results. The 2022 election was tense but every gathering in Brasília was peaceful.
Yet on the day after the inauguration, there was an abrupt change in the district's security apparatus. On Jan. 2, the district's security chief was replaced with Anderson Torres, Mr. Bolsonaro's former justice minister and a leading force behind the baseless claims that Brazil's electronic voting systems are rife with fraud. (Reviews have never uncovered evidence of fraud, and audits of the election system by independent security experts have concluded it is safe.)
Mr. Torres quickly replaced much of his department's senior staff.
On Jan. 6, two days before the planned protest, the district held a meeting that yielded a four-page plan placing much of the security responsibility on the district police, according to a copy obtained by The Times. The police would stop protesters before they reached Congress, the plan said, and would consider closing the esplanade.
Flávio Dino, Brazil's new justice minister, said that the next day, the district governor, Ibaneis Rocha, told him the esplanade would be kept off limits. Then, shortly before the protest, Mr. Dino learned from a news article that, in fact, Mr. Rocha had decided to open it to demonstrators.
The number of police officers, Mr. Dino later told reporters, was woefully inadequate "to let them go down the esplanade."
Mr. Rocha has said the size of the force was Mr. Torres's responsibility.
On Saturday, Mr. Torres was already in Florida for the start of a two-week vacation.
'A Totally Peaceful Protest'
On Sunday morning, the mood on Brasília's vast avenues was eerily calm, even as those gathering vowed to sow chaos.
Ana Priscila Azevedo, 38, an aspiring right-wing online influencer, had been posting one video after another in the lead-up to the attack. In one, she said Bolsonaro supporters planned to shut down at least eight refineries around the country to choke off gasoline supplies.
By Sunday morning, she was on the esplanade. At 11:20 a.m., she posted a video assuring followers that the stage was set for one of the most important moments of their lives. She had just spoken with two police officers, she said, and "they are completely on our side."
Bolsonaro supporters began streaming en masse down the esplanade. As their numbers swelled, they grew more belligerent, chanting in unison, "We will die for Brazil!"
Around midday, Mr. Rocha, the governor, received an audio message from an official filling in for Mr. Torres, the security chief. "Everything is calm," the official said. "A totally peaceful protest."
By early afternoon, protesters were reaching the end of the esplanade and the start of Congress's front yard -- the perimeter the police were supposed to protect. Two rows of temporary metal fencing, about 200 yards wide, marked the barrier. On the two streets flanking the front yard, there were movable roadblocks. Scattered along the front line were just a few dozen police officers.
The Modernist buildings they were protecting were largely empty, with Congress adjourned and Mr. Lula in São Paulo. But by 2:30 p.m., a crowd was collecting outside.
"People are still arriving," Bruno Gomides, a former candidate for state representative, said in a Facebook livestream. "Let's see what develops." The atmosphere was relatively tranquil.
Then, at 2:42 p.m., a surge of protesters reached one of the roadblocks. One group of protesters pulled the metal railing back, while another group pushed through the roadblock. A few police officers sprayed a chemical agent, but resistance was minimal.
Within seconds, the security line had fallen. The invasion had begun.
'The People Have Invaded Congress'
A surge of bodies, many draped in the Brazilian flag, rushed toward Congress. Many protesters ran directly to the wide ramp leading to the capitol's flat roof.
During their inaugurations, new presidents ascend that ramp and another at the Planalto, making it a symbol of taking power. Within minutes, it was crowded with protesters.
The police immediately launched tear-gas canisters, with the explosions and smoke transforming the atmosphere. On their way to Congress, protesters dipped their bandannas in a reflecting pool and put them over their faces to ward off the effects of the gas.
"I got used to the burning," Ana Carolina Isique Guardieri, a veterinarian, said into her phone, adding that she had helped pull down the barrier. "This here is ours."
As approaching protesters spotted the crowds atop Congress, they, too, began storming ahead.
"The people have invaded Congress!" shouted Joelson Sebastião Freitas as he jogged and filmed. "God bless Brazil!"
The mood was pure euphoria. Ms. Azevedo, the internet influencer, filmed herself celebrating on the ramp with a group of men. "Mission accomplished!" they shouted in unison.
On the roof, protesters painted "Armed Forces SOS" and unfurled a banner proclaiming "We Want the Source Code," referring to a conspiracy theory that the electronic voting machines were programmed for Mr. Lula.
A gray-haired woman sank to her knees and raised her hands to the sky. "A warrior!" Mr. Freitas shouted as he filmed her.
A popcorn vendor set up shop next to the reflecting pool, while a man with a stick piled high with cotton candy ascended the ramp with the crowd.
Inside, hundreds of people were laying waste. Some lifted metal pillars and smashed glass panels. Others entered the legislative chambers and scoured offices for plunder. They damaged artworks, stole computers and left a trail of glass shards.
"It was insanity," said Adriana Reis, 30, who was cleaning Congress when the invaders rushed in. "I don't think the police could handle them all."
'Lula's Palace!'
It was one thing to occupy Congress. But taking the fight to the chambers of Mr. Bolsonaro's main foes, Mr. Lula and the Supreme Court, was another.
As a mob tore through the capitol, another group headed about 300 yards to the Planalto, while a third headed 300 yards in the other direction to the Supreme Court. They easily broke into both.
The rioters made quick work of devastating much of the Supreme Court, leaving the courtroom where justices decide cases in shambles. Rioters made off with the Brazilian republic's coat of arms, a copy of Brazil's Constitution and even the robes used by the justices.
By 3:45 p.m., the ramp to the Planalto, where Mr. Lula had accepted the presidential sash, was filled with rioters.
"Look here!" said Ms. Azevedo, continuously chronicling the attack, as she reached the top of the ramp. "Lula's palace!"
Inside, the assailants overturned furniture, stole stun guns and damaged valuable treasures, including a Modernist painting by Emiliano di Cavalcanti. But they were stopped at Mr. Lula's office, his spokesman explained, because it is reinforced with bulletproof glass.
Outside, some police officers tried fighting back, firing rubber bullets and tear-gas canisters, including from two helicopters.
At one point, rioters swarmed a lone police officer on horseback. They beat him with sticks and flagpoles, and then they beat the horse.
Elsewhere, however, officers stood and watched. One video shows about 10 police officers chatting with protesters, texting and filming on their phones as rioters they were expected to stop swarmed the nation's Congress.
Pedro Lustosa, a graduate student who went to watch the protests, noticed the nonchalance of some police officers and began filming. At 3:38 p.m., three-quarters of a mile down the esplanade, he encountered a group of nearly 20 officers chatting and asked them if he could take a dip in the reflecting pool in front of Congress.
"Everything is allowed today?" he asked. The officers appear to respond affirmatively, and waved him in the direction of Congress.
The government estimates there were roughly 5,000 protesters, said Mr. Cappelli, the justice ministry official, while the district later reported that it had assigned 1,300 police to the event. (The national police force also had nearly 200 officers there, he said.)
But Mr. Cappelli said he believes there were "many fewer" than 1,300 officers present, and footage throughout the day shows them far outnumbered.
"The issue is not just the number -- if the guidance is, 'Stay there,' or 'Don't get involved,"' he said. "It's the command."
The same forces had helped secure the inauguration and other protests, he added. What had changed was their new boss: Mr. Torres, a Bolsonaro ally.
Mr. Rocha, the governor, also laid the blame on Mr. Torres and his team. "The governor was deceived," said Alberto Toron, Mr. Rocha's lawyer.
At 4:43 p.m., Mr. Rocha fired Mr. Torres, six days after he took the job.
At about 6 p.m., Mr. Lula made an emergency decree. Mr. Cappelli was named the new head of district security and headed to the street, in a suit and tie, to direct the forces.
'Military Intervention -- Against the Brazilian People!'
By that time, army soldiers, federal police officers and other reinforcements had arrived and were retaking the buildings.
At the Planalto, soldiers formed a barrier to stop any more intruders. "Military intervention -- against the Brazilian people!" Mr. Freitas shouted at them.
Other soldiers went inside. Many rioters then sat down, some praying, and begged the troops to side with them. Ms. Azevedo was among them, smiling into her camera and saluting.
The authorities arrested 210 people on the scene, many led back down the ramps in handcuffs.
That night, the Supreme Court suspended Mr. Rocha for 90 days. Later the court approved a federal police request for arrest warrants against Mr. Torres and the district police chief.
Mr. Torres, who is Mr. Bolsonaro's former justice minister, said he would prove his innocence. "I have always guided my actions with ethics and legality," he said on Twitter. On Saturday, he was arrested upon arriving in Brasília from Florida.
During a search of Mr. Torres's home, the authorities found a draft of a presidential decree that sought to effectively overturn the election. Mr. Torres has suggested he received the document from a third party and planned to throw it away.
The morning after the riot, the authorities swept a long-running protest camp outside the army headquarters, detaining 1,200 people.
At the camp, some protesters hurriedly departed with their things. Several admitted to storming the federal buildings. One said he still had a stolen flag. But in a dozen interviews, all insisted that Bolsonaro supporters did not cause the damage; it was leftists in disguise.
"Proof? No," said Antônio Morim, a trucker. "But they started it."
Ms. Azevedo was among those arrested. She had spent years trying to gain fame in Brazil's right-wing circles, and now, in custody, her videos were rocketing around the internet.
Her compatriots were also posting about her -- but not in the way she had imagined.
"Look who broke everything," read the text on a video of Ms. Azevedo shouting in a ransacked room of the Planalto, which was posted by right-wing accounts. "Priscilla vandalized and framed us patriots who were protesting peacefully."

BRASÍLIA, Brazil — As the bus made its way from Brazil’s agricultural heartland to the capital, Andrea Barth pulled out her phone to ask fellow passengers, one by one, what they intended to do once they arrived.
“Overthrow the thieves,” one man replied.
“Take out ‘Nine-Finger,’” said another, referring to Brazil’s leftist president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who lost part of a finger decades ago in a factory accident.
As the passengers described their plans for violence, more than a hundred other buses bulging with supporters of Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right former president, were also descending on Brasília, the capital.
A day later, on Jan. 8, a pro-Bolsonaro mob unleashed mayhem that shocked the country and was broadcast around the world. Rioters invaded and ransacked Brazil’s Congress, Supreme Court and presidential offices, intending, many of them said, to spur military leaders to topple Lula, who had taken office a week earlier.
The assault showed that far-right extremism remains a grave threat.
Lula and judicial authorities have moved swiftly to reassert control, arresting more than 1,150 rioters, clearing the encampments that gave them refuge, searching for their funders and organizers and, on Friday, opening an investigation into how Bolsonaro may have inspired them.
The New York Times spoke with law enforcement, government officials, eyewitnesses and protesters, and reviewed dozens of videos and hundreds of social media posts to piece together what happened. The reporting shows that a mob swiftly and effortlessly overwhelmed a drastically outnumbered police presence.
It also shows that some officers not only failed to take any action against rioters, but they also appeared to be sympathetic, snapping photos as the mob tore through Congress.
The imbalance between protesters and police remains a central focus of the authorities’ investigation, and interviews with security officials yielded accusations of gross negligence and even active complicity in the mayhem. After the riot, federal authorities suspended the governor responsible for protecting the buildings and arrested two top security officials who worked for him.
While Brazil’s institutions formed a united front against any attempt by Bolsonaro to challenge the election’s results — the former president has absconded to a rental home near Disney World — his false claims about voter fraud have festered and spread across Latin America’s largest nation.
The morning after the riot, interviews with a dozen protesters showed that they were far from giving up and were even moving past the man who had once led them.
“We are not here for President Bolsonaro anymore. We are here for our nation, our freedom,” said Nathanael S. Viera, 51, who had driven 900 miles to fight against what he said was a communist plot. “Our future is being stolen. You understand?”
On New Year’s Day, Lula ascended the ramp to Brazil’s presidential offices and accepted the green and gold presidential sash from a woman who collects trash to recycle. Bolsonaro had already decamped for Florida.
Days later, calls went out across pro-Bolsonaro corners of the internet for an enormous Sunday demonstration in the capital, right where Lula’s supporters had celebrated a week before.
“The plan is to surround Brasília,” one person wrote in a Telegram group, attaching an aerial image of Congress, the Supreme Court and the Planalto Palace, headquarters of the presidency.
Yet the plans did not appear to overly alarm authorities.
Ricardo Cappelli, the No. 2 official at Brazil’s justice ministry, said that pro-Bolsonaro rallies had long taken on conspiratorial tones but had remained largely nonviolent. The planned protest’s location — the mile-long grassy esplanade that ends at Brazil’s Congress — has been the choice spot for Brazilians to vent their frustration for decades, sometimes with crowds in the hundreds of thousands.
Intelligence suggested that Sunday’s turnout would be just a few thousand.
While the esplanade is lined with the federal government’s most important buildings, a different entity has long handled security of demonstrations there: the district government that oversees Brasília.
The federal government pays the district $2 billion each year to provide security, and had been satisfied with the results.
Yet on Jan. 2, the district’s security chief was replaced with Anderson Torres, Bolsonaro’s former justice minister and a leading force behind the baseless claims that Brazil’s electronic voting systems are rife with fraud.
Torres quickly replaced much of his department’s senior staff.
On Jan. 6, the district held a meeting that yielded a four-page plan placing much of the security responsibility on the district police, according to a copy obtained by the Times. Police would stop protesters before they reached Congress, the plan said, and would consider closing the esplanade.
Flávio Dino, Brazil’s new justice minister, said that the next day, the district governor, Ibaneis Rocha, told him the esplanade would be kept off limits. Then, shortly before the protest, Dino learned from a news article that, in fact, Rocha had decided to open it to demonstrators.
The number of police officers, Dino later told reporters, was woefully inadequate “to let them go down the esplanade.”
Rocha has said the size of the force was Torres’ responsibility. On Saturday, Torres was in Florida for the start of a two-week vacation.
On Sunday morning, the mood on Brasília’s vast avenues was eerily calm.
Ana Priscila Azevedo, 38, an aspiring right-wing online influencer, had been posting one video after another in the lead-up to the attack. In one, she said Bolsonaro supporters planned to shut down at least eight refineries around the country to choke off gasoline supplies.
By Sunday morning, she was on the esplanade. At 11:20 a.m., she posted a video assuring followers that the stage was set for one of the most important moments of their lives. She had just spoken with two police officers, she said, and “they are completely on our side.”
Bolsonaro supporters began streaming en masse down the esplanade. As their numbers swelled, they grew more belligerent, chanting in unison, “We will die for Brazil!”
Around midday, Rocha, the governor, received an audio message from an official filling in for Torres, the security chief. “Everything is calm,” the official said.
Then, at 2:42 p.m., a surge of protesters reached one of the roadblocks. One group of protesters pulled the metal railing back, while another group pushed through the roadblock. A few police officers sprayed a chemical agent, but resistance was minimal.
Within seconds, the security line had fallen. The invasion had begun.
A surge of bodies rushed toward Congress. Many protesters ran directly to the wide ramp leading to the capitol’s flat roof.
As a mob tore through the capitol, another group headed about 300 yards to the Planalto, while a third headed 300 yards in the other direction to the Supreme Court. They easily broke into both.
By 3:45 p.m., the ramp to the Planalto was filled with rioters.
The government estimates there were roughly 5,000 protesters, said Cappelli, the justice ministry official, while the district later reported that it had assigned 1,300 police to the event.
But Cappelli said he believes there were “many fewer” than 1,300 officers present, and footage throughout the day shows them far outnumbered.
“The issue is not just the number — if the guidance is, ‘Stay there,’ or ‘Don’t get involved,’” he said. “It’s the command.”
The same forces had helped secure the inauguration and other protests, he added. What had changed was their new boss: Torres, a Bolsonaro ally.
Rocha also laid the blame on Torres and his team. “The governor was deceived,” said Alberto Toron, Rocha’s lawyer.
At 4:43 p.m., Rocha fired Torres, six days after he took the job.
About 6 p.m., Lula made an emergency decree. Cappelli was named the new head of district security and headed to the street, in a suit and tie, to direct the forces.
By that time, army soldiers, federal police and other reinforcements had arrived and were retaking the buildings. Authorities arrested 210 people on the scene.
That night, the Supreme Court suspended Rocha for 90 days. Later the court approved a federal police request for arrest warrants against Torres and the district police chief. On Saturday, Torres was arrested upon arriving in Brasília from Florida.
During a search of Torres’ home, authorities found a draft of a presidential decree that sought to effectively overturn the election. Torres has suggested he received the document from a third party and planned to throw it away.
The morning after the riot, authorities swept a long-running protest camp outside the army headquarters, detaining 1,200 people. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

The Party's Over for Us. Where Do We Go Now?: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For decades, conservative values have been central to Bret Stephens's and David Brooks's political beliefs, and the Republican Party was the vehicle to extend those beliefs into policy. But in recent years, both the party and a radicalized conservative movement have left them feeling alienated in various ways. Now, with an extremist fringe seemingly in control of the House, the G.O.P. bears little resemblance to the party that was once their home. Bret and David got together to suss out what happened and where the party can go.
Bret Stephens: Lately I've been thinking about that classic Will Rogers line: "I am not a member of any organized political party. I am a Democrat." A century or so later, it looks like the shoe is on the other foot. Is it even possible to call the Republican Party a "party" anymore?
David Brooks: My thinking about the G.O.P. goes back to a brunch I had with Laura Ingraham and Dinesh D'Souza in the '80s that helps me see, in retrospect, that people in my circle were pro-conservative, while Ingraham and D'Souza and people in their circle were anti-left. We wanted to champion Edmund Burke and Adam Smith and a Reaganite foreign policy. They wanted to rock the establishment. That turned out to be a consequential difference because almost all the people in my circle back then -- like David Frum and Robert Kagan -- ended up, decades later, NeverTrumpers, and almost all the people in their circle became Trumpers or went bonkers.
Bret: Right, they weren't conservatives. They were just illiberal.
David: Then in 1995 some friends and I created a magazine called The Weekly Standard. The goal was to help the G.O.P. become a mature governing party. Clearly we did an awesome job! I have a zillion thoughts about where the Republican Party went astray, but do you have a core theory?
Bret: I have multiple theories, but let me start with one: The mid-1990s was also the time that Newt Gingrich became speaker of the House and Fox News got started. Back then, those who were on the more intelligent end of the conservative spectrum thought a magazine such as The Weekly Standard, a channel such as Fox and a guy like Gingrich would be complementary: The Standard would provide innovative ideas for Republican leaders like Gingrich, and Fox would popularize those ideas for right-of-center voters. It didn't work out as planned. The supposed popularizers turned into angry populists. And the populists turned on the intellectuals.
To borrow Warren Buffett's take about investing, the conservative movement went from innovation to imitation to idiocy. It's how the movement embraced Donald Trump as a standard-bearer and role model. All the rest, as they say, is Commentary.
Your theory?
David: I think I'd tell a similar story, but maybe less flattering to my circle. The people who led the Republican Party, either as president (Ronald Reagan through the Bushes), members of Congress (Jack Kemp, John McCain, Paul Ryan) or as administration officials and intellectuals (Richard Darman, Condi Rice) believed in promoting change through the institutions of established power. They generally wanted to shrink and reform the government but they venerated the Senate, the institution of the presidency, and they worked comfortably with people from the think tanks, the press and the universities. They were liberal internationalists, cosmopolitan, believers in the value of immigration.
Bret: I'd add that they also believed in the core values of old-fashioned liberalism: faith in the goodness of democracy, human rights, the rule of law, free speech, political compromise, the political process itself. They believed in building things up, not just tearing them down. I would count myself among them.
David: Then the establishment got discredited (Iraq War, financial crisis, the ossifying of the meritocracy, the widening values gap between metro elites and everybody else), and suddenly all the people I regarded as fringe and wackadoodle (Pat Buchanan, Donald Trump, anybody who ran CPAC) rose up on the wave of populist fury.
Everybody likes a story in which the little guy rises up to take on the establishment, but in this case the little guys rode in on a wave of know-nothingism, mendacity, an apocalyptic mind-set, and authoritarianism. Within a few short years, a somewhat Hamiltonian party became a Jacksonian one, with a truly nihilistic wing.
Bret: Slightly unfair to Jackson, who at least opposed nullification, but I take your overall point.
David: After many years of the G.O.P. decaying, the party's institutional and moral collapse happened quickly, between 2013 and 2016. In the 2000 Republican primaries I enthusiastically supported John McCain. I believed in his approach to governance and I admired him enormously. But by 2008, when he got the nomination, the party had shifted and McCain had shifted along with it. I walked into the polling booth that November genuinely not knowing if I would vote for McCain or Barack Obama. Then an optical illusion flashed across my brain. McCain and Obama's names appeared to be written on the ballot in 12-point type. But Sarah Palin's name looked like it was written in red in 24-point type. I don't think I've ever said this publicly before, but I voted for Obama.
Bret: I voted for McCain. If I were basing my presidential votes on the vice-presidential candidate, I'd have thought twice about voting for Biden.
On your point about populism: There have been previous Republican presidents who rode to office on waves of populist discontent, particularly Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. But as presidents they channeled the discontent into serious programs and also turned their backs on the ugly fringes of the right. Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency and expanded the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Reagan established a working relationship with Democratic House leaders to pass tax reform and gave amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. What's different this time is that populist feelings were never harnessed to pragmatic policies. As you say, it's just populism in the service of nihilism.
David: So where does the G.O.P. go from here and where does the old core of the conservative movement go? Do they (we) become Democrats or a quiet left-wing fringe of what's become Matt Gaetz's clown show?
Bret: When people get on a bad path, whether it's drinking or gambling or political or religious fanaticism, they tend to follow it all the way to the bottom, at which point they either die or have that proverbial moment of clarity. I've been waiting for Republicans to have a moment of clarity for a while now -- after Joe Biden's victory, or Jan. 6, the midterms, Trump's dinner with Kanye West. I had a flicker of hope that the Kevin McCarthy debacle last week would open some eyes, but probably not. Part of the problem is that so many Republicans no longer get into politics to pass legislation. They do it to become celebrities. The more feverish they are, the better it sells.
On the other hand, some Republicans who conspicuously did well in the midterms were the "normies" -- people like Gov. Brian Kemp in Georgia and Gov. Mike DeWine in Ohio. It gives me hope that the fever will eventually burn itself out, maybe after a few well-earned defeats. The solution here is some kind of Republican version of the old Democratic Leadership Council, which yanked left-wing Democrats back to the center after three consecutive presidential wipeouts and paved the way for the election of Bill Clinton.
Which raises another question for me, David: Where are the old brains and money trusts of the G.O.P., to give life and energy to that kind of effort?
David: Well, it's not going to be me! Even in my red-hot youth, when I worked for Bill Buckley at National Review, I didn't see myself as a Republican, just a conservative. I maintain a distance from political parties because I think it's always wrong for a writer to align too closely to a party. That's the path to predictability and propagandism. Furthermore, I belong in the American tradition that begins with Alexander Hamilton, runs through the Whig Party and Lincoln, and then modernized with Theodore Roosevelt, parts of Reagan and McCain. I wasted years writing essays on how Republicans could maintain this tradition. The party went the other way. Now I think the Democrats are a better Hamiltonian home.
Bret: I'm part of the same conservative tradition, though maybe with a heavier dose of Milton Friedman.
David: Our trajectories with the G.O.P. are fairly similar, and so are our lives. I'm older than you, but our lives have a number of parallels. We both grew up in secular Jewish families, went to the University of Chicago, worked at The Wall Street Journal, served in Brussels for The Journal, and wound up at The Times.
Bret: We also probably had many of the same professors at Chicago -- wonderful teachers like Nathan Tarcov, Ralph Lerner, François Furet, and Leon and Amy Kass -- who taught me that Lesson No. 1 was to not succumb to the idea that justice is the advantage of the stronger, and to always keep an open mind to a powerful counterargument. That's not a mind-set I see with the current Republican leaders.
David: When people ask me whether they should end a relationship they're in, I answer them with a question: Are the embers dead? Presumably when the relationship started there was a flame of love. Is some of that warmth still there, waiting to be revived, or is it just stone-cold ash? In my relationship with the G.O.P., the embers are dead. I look at the recent madness in the House with astonishment but detachment. Isaiah Berlin once declared he belonged to "the extreme right-wing edge of the left-wing movement," and if that location is good enough for old Ike Berlin, it's good enough for me.
Bret: I wouldn't have had trouble calling myself a Republican till 2012, when I started to write pretty critically about the direction the party was taking on social issues, immigration and foreign policy. In 2016 I voted for a Democratic presidential candidate for the first time in my life, did it again in 2020, and I think of myself as a conservative-minded independent. If I haven't finalized my divorce from the G.O.P., we're definitely separated and living apart.
David: I suppose I went through stages of alienation. By the early 2000s, I came to believe that the free market policies that were right to combat stagnation and sclerosis a few decades earlier were not right for an age of inequality and social breakdown. Then the congressional Republicans began to oppose almost every positive federal good, even George W. Bush's compassionate conservatism. Trump brought the three horsemen of the apocalypse -- immorality, dishonesty and bigotry. The party, complicit in all that, is dead to me, even though, I have to say, a good chunk of my friends are Republicans.
Bret: I'm loath to give up completely on Republicans only because I believe a successful democracy needs a morally healthy conservative party -- one that channels conservative psychological tendencies into policies to check heedless progressivism while engaging productively with an evolving world. I see no other plausible vehicle to advance those policies. Still, the party's road to recovery is going to be long and hard. And it's going to require some courageous and credible conservatives to speak up and denounce the current direction of the party.
David: As for who is going to lead a Republican revival, I guess I'd start in the states. One of Al From's insights in leading the Democratic Leadership Council was that change was going to come from the young and ambitious state legislators and governors, like Bill Clinton -- a new generation of politicians from moderate parts of the country. But the Democrats had a strong incentive to change because they lost a lot of elections between 1968 and 1992. The country is now so evenly divided, it takes only a slight shift to produce victory, and nobody has an incentive to rethink his or her party.
Bret: And, of course, when Republicans lose, they console themselves with the thought that it's because the other side cheated.
David: If the Republican Party is to thrive, intellectually and politically, it will have to become a multiracial working-class party. A lot of people are already thinking along these lines. Oren Cass at American Compass has been pushing a working-class agenda. The Trumpish writers and activists who call themselves national conservatives are not my cup of tea, but they do speak in the tone of anti-coastal-elite protest that is going to be the melody of this party for a long time to come. To my mind, Yuval Levin is one of the brightest conservatives in America today. He runs a division at the American Enterprise Institute where the debates over the future of the right are already being held.
The party will either revive or crack up, the way the Whig Party did. But it's going to take decades. If I'm still around to see it, I'll be eating mush and listening to Led Zeppelin Muzak with the other fogeys at the Rockefeller Republican Home for the Aged.
Bret: You may well be right about how long it takes. But I don't think it's going to do so as a party of the working class. The natural place for the G.O.P. is as the party of economic freedom, social aspiration and moral responsibility -- a party of risers, if not always of winners. Its archetypal constituent is the small-business owner. It wants less regulation because it understands from experience how well-intended ideas from above translate into onerous and stupid rules at the ground level. It doesn't mind big business per se but objects to moralizing C.E.O.s who try to use their size and incumbency to impose left-coast ideology. And it thinks there should be consequences, not excuses, for unlawful behavior, which means it looks askance at policies like bail reform and lax law enforcement at borders.
The problem is that Trump turned the party into a single-purpose vehicle for cultural resentments. It doesn't help that coastal elites do so much on their own to feed those resentments.
David: We've reached a rare moment of disagreement! Your configuration for Republicans was a product of long debates in the 20th century. Size-of-government arguments are going to be less salient. Values, identity and social status issues will be more salient. I think the core driver of politics across the Western democracies is this: In society after society, highly educated professionals have formed a Brahmin class. The top of the ladder go to competitive colleges, marry each other, send their kids to elite schools and live in the same neighborhoods. This class dominates the media, the academy, Hollywood, tech and the corporate sector.
Many people on the middle and bottom have risen up to say, we don't want to be ruled by those guys. To hell with their economic, cultural and political power. We'll vote for anybody who can smash their machine. The Republican Party is the party of this protest movement.
Bret: Another way of thinking about the class/partisan divide you are describing is between people whose business is the production and distribution of words -- academics, journalists, civil servants, lawyers, intellectuals -- and people whose business is the production and distribution of things -- manufacturers, drivers, contractors, distributors, and so on. The first group makes the rules for the administrative state. The latter lives under the weight of those rules, and will continue to be the base of the G.O.P.
By the way, since you mentioned earlier the need for new leaders to come from the states, is there anyone who particularly impresses you? And how do you feel about the quasi-nominee-in-waiting, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida?
David: I'm slightly bearish about DeSantis. He does a good job of being Trumpy without Trump, but I wonder if a man who apparently has net negative social skills and empathy can really thrive during an intimately covered national campaign that will last two years. Trump was at least funny, and to his voters, charismatic. Do you have any other candidates on your radar screen?
Bret: Well, I don't think it'll be either of the Mikes -- Pious Pence or Pompous Pompeo. I like Nikki Haley personally and think she has a good mind and a terrific personal story. But I don't get the sense of much public enthusiasm for her beyond high-level donors.
Which brings me back to DeSantis. He seems to have figured out that the G.O.P. sits on a three-legged stool consisting of Trumpists, evangelicals and the business community. He's earned the respect of the first with his pugilistic jabs at the media, of the second with his attacks on Disney and his parental rights legislation, and of the third with an open-for-business approach to governance that has brought hundreds of thousands of people to Florida. Next to all that, the personality defects seem pretty surmountable.
David: Sigh. I can't rebut your logic here. Save us, Glenn Youngkin!
Bret: Final question, David: If you could rewind the tape to 1995, is there anything you or anyone in our circle could have done differently to save the Republican Party from the direction it ultimately took?
David: In 1996 Pat Buchanan's sister, Kathleen, worked at The Standard as an executive assistant. A truly wonderful woman. We virulently opposed Pat in his presidential run that year. The day after he won the New Hampshire primary she smiled kindly at us and said something to the effect of: Don't worry. I'll protect you guys when the pitchforks come.
Bret: Given what happened to The Standard, it didn't work out as promised.
David: I wish we had taken that Buchanan victory more seriously, since it was a precursor of what was to come. I wish we had pivoted our conservatism even faster away from (sorry) Wall Street Journal editorial page ideas and come up with conservative approaches to inequality, to deindustrialization, to racial disparities, etc. I wish, in other words, that our mentalities had shifted faster.
But in truth, I don't believe it would have made any difference. Authoritarian populism is a global phenomenon. The Republicans were destined to turn more populist. The big question is, do they continue on the path to authoritarianism?
Bret: I look back at the world of conservative ideas I grew up in, professionally speaking, and I see a lot worth holding on to: George Kelling and James Q. Wilson on crime, Nicholas Eberstadt on social breakdown, Linda Chavez on immigration, Shelby Steele on racial issues, Garry Kasparov on the threat of Vladimir Putin, and so on. I don't think the ideas were the core problem, even if not every one of them stands the test of time. The problem was that, when the illiberal barbarians were at the conservative gates, the gatekeepers had a catastrophic loss of nerve. Whether it's too late to regain that nerve is, to me, the ultimate question.

Full text: I was recently shown some frames from a film that I had never heard of: Alejandro Jodorowsky's 1976 version of "Tron." The sets were incredible. The actors, unfamiliar to me, looked fantastic in their roles. The costumes and lighting worked together perfectly. The images glowed with an extravagant and psychedelic sensibility that felt distinctly Jodorowskian.
However, Mr. Jodorowsky, the visionary Chilean filmmaker, never tried to make "Tron." I'm not even sure he knows what "Tron" is. And Disney's original "Tron" was released in 1982. So what 1970s film were these gorgeous stills from? Who were these neon-suited actors? And how did I -- the director of the documentary "Jodorowsky's Dune," having spent two and a half years interviewing and working with Alejandro to tell the story of his famously unfinished film -- not know about this?
The truth is that these weren't stills from a long-lost movie. They weren't photos at all. These evocative, well-composed and tonally immaculate images were generated in seconds with artificial intelligence.
During the filming of my documentary, Alejandro told me about the Greek-Armenian philosopher and mystic George Gurdjieff. He taught that we are born without a soul and that our task in life is to help our soul to grow and develop: Souls aren't born; they're earned. Every single day, Alejandro creates. He writes, he draws, he paints. He works on his soul through art. Next month he'll turn 94, and he's preparing to direct a new film. He's a man in perpetual creative motion.
I first met Alejandro in 2010, when I approached him about filming a documentary on his mid-1970s attempt to make a feature film version of Frank Herbert's sci-fi novel "Dune." My interest wasn't in the story of the young noble Paul Atreides, the desert planet Arrakis or the mind-altering spice called melange. I wanted to find out why the mysterious and guru-like director chose to follow up his 1970 acid western "El Topo" (the very first midnight movie) and 1973 scandalous and hallucinogenic "The Holy Mountain" with an attempt to make the most colossal science-fiction film of all time.
After adapting the novel into a screenplay, he worked for two years with a team of artists -- his "spiritual warriors": the British illustrator Chris Foss, who helped him design his striped spaceships; the Swiss artist H.R. Giger, whose dark style would help him create the home planet of the film's villains; the American special effects innovator Dan O'Bannon; and, of course, Jean Giraud, France's greatest comics artist, who would help Alejandro design the costumes, as well as draw the more than 3,000 storyboard sketches needed to visualize this epic tale.
The cast would have included Mick Jagger, Orson Welles, Salvador Dalí and Alejandro's 12-year-old son, Brontis, in the lead role. The soundtrack would have been composed and recorded by Pink Floyd.
He wanted "Dune" to be more than a movie. It was to be a prophet! It was to change the world! And it was not to be. You've never seen the film because it was never completed.
The project ended once Alejandro presented his massive compendium of artwork to the Hollywood studios. They turned it down out of fear or shortsightedness or simply because they could not comprehend what he was trying to do. Or maybe it was because he refused to submit to the practical limits of the two-hour film, threatening that his "Dune" would be as long as 20 hours.
He was never given the chance to shoot a single frame of "Dune." There's no unused footage that can be dismissed because of campy acting or poor special effects. It will forever be the greatest film never made, because it exists solely in our imaginations.
Just because you can't watch Alejandro's "Dune" doesn't mean it didn't change the world. This unfilmed film's influence on our culture is astounding. Ideas and images from the "Dune" art bible have escaped into the world. They can be experienced in movies like "Blade Runner," "Raiders of the Lost Ark," "Prometheus," "The Terminator" and the original "Star Wars." His "Dune" does not exist, yet it's all around us.
It took Alejandro and his team two years of pure analog struggle to create his "Dune" -- pencil on paper, paint on canvas, inventing the practical effects required to deliver his onscreen spectacle.
It's different with A.I. No struggle was involved in creating these images of "Jodorowsky's Tron." It didn't require any special skills or extensive direction from Johnny Darrell, the Canadian director who made these pictures with an A.I. program called Midjourney. A simple prompt is all it took: a few words -- in this case, slight variations on "production still from 1976 of Alejandro Jodorowsky's Tron" -- followed by less than a minute of waiting, and a computer deep in the racks of a data center somewhere, sifting through the numbers encoded into its memory banks associated with the words "Tron" and "Jodorowsky."
I'm still trying to wrap my mind around it all. There seems to be a correlation between how Alejandro's work was absorbed and referred to by subsequent filmmakers and how it was ingested and metabolized by computer programming. But these two things aren't the same. I want to say that influence is not the same thing as algorithm. But looking at these images, how can I be sure?
To what extent do these rapidly generated images contain creativity? And from what source is that creativity emerging? Has Alejandro been robbed? Is the training of this A.I. model the greatest art heist in history? How much of art-making is theft, anyway?
On the one hand, the software gives you a kind of turbocharged pastiche. But there's still some fresh splendor in that imitation. It's succeeding at one of filmmaking's main jobs: transporting you to another time, to another world. If A.I.s were eligible for the Academy Awards, I'd vote for "Jodorowsky's Tron" for best A.I. costume design just for dreaming up such outrageous retro sci-fi hats and helmets.
If, as Mr. Gurdjieff taught, creation leads to the development of one's soul, whose soul is being developed here?
Nothing in this software seems controllable in the pixel-precise way artists use digital tools like Photoshop. When Mr. Darrell generated these images, he didn't choose the colors, the framing or what the characters would be doing. He also didn't determine some of the other choices that the A.I. program assimilated from 1970s science fiction: the seemingly all-white cast and the vintage gender roles. Whatever he might have had in his mind's eye was not what he was going to get. He needed to state his prompt cleanly and clearly. But the creativity bubbled out of the machine.
In exploring more of Mr. Darrell's A.I. experimentation, I saw some still images that he made for an occult motorcycle flick called "The Snakes Are the Devil." They were incredible. So full of mystery and depth. I wanted to watch this movie.
I promptly went to IMDb to search it out. But no such luck. Hmmmmm. I went back to his images, one of which was a lobby card. I noted the lead actor's name, Jay Clennan, and returned to IMDb. No such actor exists.
I couldn't find anything because there was no film. There was no actor. There was no anything. These images were another A.I. creation. And I'd known that right from the start. Yet still, I hoped that somehow it was real. I'm still annoyed at Mr. Darrell for making me want what I can't have.
That's how powerful it is to allow A.I. to generate pictures of films or other art objects you wish could exist. It's like watching a magic show. Going in, you know it will all be illusions and sleight of hand. But during the show, your suspension of disbelief kicks in. Your heart wants to believe it's real, and it gets your brain to go along for the ride. Life is more fun that way.
What will it mean when directors, concept artists and film students can see with their imaginations, when they can paint using all the digitally archived visual material of human civilization? When our culture starts to be influenced by scenes, sets and images from old films that never existed or that haven't yet even been imagined?
I have a feeling we're all about to find out.

As the bus made its way from Brazil’s agricultural heartland to the capital, Andrea Barth pulled out her phone to ask fellow passengers, one by one, what they intended to do once they arrived.
“Overthrow the thieves,” one man replied.
“Take out ‘Nine-Finger,’” said another, referring to Brazil’s leftist president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who lost part of a finger decades ago in a factory accident.
As the passengers described their plans for violence, more than a hundred other buses bulging with supporters of Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right former president, were also descending on Brasília, the capital.
A day later, on Jan. 8, a pro-Bolsonaro mob unleashed mayhem that shocked the country and was broadcast around the world. Rioters invaded and ransacked Brazil’s Congress, Supreme Court and presidential offices, intending, many of them said, to spur military leaders to topple Lula, who had taken office a week earlier.
The assault showed that far-right extremism remains a grave threat.
Lula and judicial authorities have moved swiftly to reassert control, arresting more than 1,150 rioters, clearing the encampments that gave them refuge, searching for their funders and organizers and, on Friday, opening an investigation into how Bolsonaro may have inspired them.
The New York Times spoke with law enforcement, government officials, eyewitnesses and protesters, and reviewed dozens of videos and hundreds of social media posts to piece together what happened. The reporting shows that a mob swiftly and effortlessly overwhelmed a drastically outnumbered police presence.
It also shows that some officers not only failed to take any action against rioters, but they also appeared to be sympathetic, snapping photos as the mob tore through Congress.
The imbalance between protesters and police remains a central focus of the authorities’ investigation, and interviews with security officials yielded accusations of gross negligence and even active complicity in the mayhem. After the riot, federal authorities suspended the governor responsible for protecting the buildings and arrested two top security officials who worked for him.
While Brazil’s institutions formed a united front against any attempt by Bolsonaro to challenge the election’s results — the former president has absconded to a rental home near Disney World — his false claims about voter fraud have festered and spread across Latin America’s largest nation.
The morning after the riot, interviews with a dozen protesters showed that they were far from giving up and were even moving past the man who had once led them.
“We are not here for President Bolsonaro anymore. We are here for our nation, our freedom,” said Nathanael S. Viera, 51, who had driven 900 miles to fight against what he said was a communist plot. “Our future is being stolen. You understand?”
On New Year’s Day, Lula ascended the ramp to Brazil’s presidential offices and accepted the green and gold presidential sash from a woman who collects trash to recycle. Bolsonaro had already decamped for Florida.
Days later, calls went out across pro-Bolsonaro corners of the internet for an enormous Sunday demonstration in the capital, right where Lula’s supporters had celebrated a week before.
“The plan is to surround Brasília,” one person wrote in a Telegram group, attaching an aerial image of Congress, the Supreme Court and the Planalto Palace, headquarters of the presidency.
Yet the plans did not appear to overly alarm authorities.
Ricardo Cappelli, the No. 2 official at Brazil’s justice ministry, said that pro-Bolsonaro rallies had long taken on conspiratorial tones but had remained largely nonviolent. The planned protest’s location — the mile-long grassy esplanade that ends at Brazil’s Congress — has been the choice spot for Brazilians to vent their frustration for decades, sometimes with crowds in the hundreds of thousands.
Intelligence suggested that Sunday’s turnout would be just a few thousand.
While the esplanade is lined with the federal government’s most important buildings, a different entity has long handled security of demonstrations there: the district government that oversees Brasília.
The federal government pays the district $2 billion each year to provide security, and had been satisfied with the results.
Yet on Jan. 2, the district’s security chief was replaced with Anderson Torres, Bolsonaro’s former justice minister and a leading force behind the baseless claims that Brazil’s electronic voting systems are rife with fraud.
Torres quickly replaced much of his department’s senior staff.
On Jan. 6, the district held a meeting that yielded a four-page plan placing much of the security responsibility on the district police, according to a copy obtained by the Times. Police would stop protesters before they reached Congress, the plan said, and would consider closing the esplanade.
Flávio Dino, Brazil’s new justice minister, said that the next day, the district governor, Ibaneis Rocha, told him the esplanade would be kept off limits. Then, shortly before the protest, Dino learned from a news article that, in fact, Rocha had decided to open it to demonstrators.
The number of police officers, Dino later told reporters, was woefully inadequate “to let them go down the esplanade.”
Rocha has said the size of the force was Torres’ responsibility. On Saturday, Torres was in Florida for the start of a two-week vacation.
On Sunday morning, the mood on Brasília’s vast avenues was eerily calm.
Ana Priscila Azevedo, 38, an aspiring right-wing online influencer, had been posting one video after another in the lead-up to the attack. In one, she said Bolsonaro supporters planned to shut down at least eight refineries around the country to choke off gasoline supplies.
By Sunday morning, she was on the esplanade. At 11:20 a.m., she posted a video assuring followers that the stage was set for one of the most important moments of their lives. She had just spoken with two police officers, she said, and “they are completely on our side.”
Bolsonaro supporters began streaming en masse down the esplanade. As their numbers swelled, they grew more belligerent, chanting in unison, “We will die for Brazil!”
Around midday, Rocha, the governor, received an audio message from an official filling in for Torres, the security chief. “Everything is calm,” the official said.
Then, at 2:42 p.m., a surge of protesters reached one of the roadblocks. One group of protesters pulled the metal railing back, while another group pushed through the roadblock. A few police officers sprayed a chemical agent, but resistance was minimal.
Within seconds, the security line had fallen. The invasion had begun.
A surge of bodies rushed toward Congress. Many protesters ran directly to the wide ramp leading to the capitol’s flat roof.
As a mob tore through the capitol, another group headed about 300 yards to the Planalto, while a third headed 300 yards in the other direction to the Supreme Court. They easily broke into both.
By 3:45 p.m., the ramp to the Planalto was filled with rioters.
The government estimates there were roughly 5,000 protesters, said Cappelli, the justice ministry official, while the district later reported that it had assigned 1,300 police to the event.
But Cappelli said he believes there were “many fewer” than 1,300 officers present, and footage throughout the day shows them far outnumbered.
“The issue is not just the number — if the guidance is, ‘Stay there,’ or ‘Don’t get involved,’” he said. “It’s the command.”
The same forces had helped secure the inauguration and other protests, he added. What had changed was their new boss: Torres, a Bolsonaro ally.
Rocha also laid the blame on Torres and his team. “The governor was deceived,” said Alberto Toron, Rocha’s lawyer.
At 4:43 p.m., Rocha fired Torres, six days after he took the job.
About 6 p.m., Lula made an emergency decree. Cappelli was named the new head of district security and headed to the street, in a suit and tie, to direct the forces.
By that time, army soldiers, federal police and other reinforcements had arrived and were retaking the buildings. Authorities arrested 210 people on the scene.
That night, the Supreme Court suspended Rocha for 90 days. Later the court approved a federal police request for arrest warrants against Torres and the district police chief. On Saturday, Torres was arrested upon arriving in Brasília from Florida.
During a search of Torres’ home, authorities found a draft of a presidential decree that sought to effectively overturn the election. Torres has suggested he received the document from a third party and planned to throw it away.
The morning after the riot, authorities swept a long-running protest camp outside the army headquarters, detaining 1,200 people. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Your Tax Refunds May Be Smaller This Year: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Credits that were expanded as part of pandemic relief have expired, as has the deduction for donations for people who don't itemize.
With the expiration of more generous tax credits offered as pandemic relief, many taxpayers could see "significantly smaller" refunds this year, the Internal Revenue Service says. In some instances, taxpayers may owe money.
The federal government temporarily expanded several tax credits for 2021 to help support families during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic. But Congress declined to make the changes permanent, so the credits reverted to prepandemic levels for 2022.
The child tax credit, available to working parents who meet certain income and other rules, provided as much as $ 3,600 per child in 2021. About 61 million children benefited, according to the Treasury Department. But for 2022, the credit returned to a maximum of $ 2,000 per child for eligible families. That means a family with three children may have received as much as $ 10,800 under the expansion, but would get at most $ 6,000 in 2022.
"That's a big, noticeable difference," said Melanie Lauridsen, director of tax practice and ethics for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
For the earned-income tax credit, available to low- and moderate-income workers, a qualifying taxpayer with no children who received about $ 1,500 in 2021 would now receive $ 560, according to the I.R.S. And the child and dependent care credit, available to those who need care for family members while they work, returned to a maximum of $ 2,100, from $ 8,000 in 2021.
The changes could shrink refunds, or possibly result in a balance due in some cases.
Kathy Brown, president of the National Association of Enrolled Agents, a group for federally licensed tax preparers, said some taxpayers may be disappointed if they are expecting the same refund as last year.
Ms. Brown said she heard from a client who was eager to have her return processed so she could use her refund to take her child on a Disney vacation. Ms. Brown advised her to hold off on booking the trip, cautioning her that the refund "won't be as large as it was last year."
Some people who typically get small refunds or break even often file for an automatic filing extension, since they don't feel a sense of urgency, Ms. Brown said. But this year, she said, filers shouldn't assume they won't have a tax bill. "They may not get a refund, and they may actually owe tax." In that case, getting an extension may cost them interest and a late-payment penalty because an extension allows more time to file, but not to pay.
Taxpayers may also see reduced refunds this year because of the end of Covid relief stimulus payments, also known as economic impact payments. The third and final payment, of $ 1,400, went out to most eligible people automatically starting in March 2021. But those who didn't receive it could claim it as a recovery rebate credit on their 2021 tax return, so it would reduce their tax bill or be included in their refund when they filed their return in 2022. But there were no stimulus payments last year, so no recovery rebate credit is available on 2022 returns, said Kathy Pickering, chief tax officer at H&R Block. "There have been a lot of changes, with the expiration of Covid relief programs," she said.
Filers may want to have their returns prepared early in the filing season, so they can adjust their budget if their refund falls short of expectations. "Knowing where you stand lets you make appropriate decisions," Ms. Pickering said.
If you do owe money, don't panic, she said. You can file your return when the I.R.S. begins accepting them, but you don't have to pay the tax until the filing deadline in April. That gives you about three months to save up the money. If you don't have the full amount, you may qualify for a payment plan.
Also in 2022, some states with budget surpluses have been issuing tax rebates to residents. While there has been some confusion about whether such payments count as taxable income on 2022 federal returns, that is not the case, said Richard Auxier, senior policy associate at the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution.
Other changes this year include the end of a tax break for charitable donations for people who don't itemize, or detail, their various tax deductions. Last year, filers who chose the standard deduction -- a flat amount that reduces taxable income -- could claim a charitable deduction of up to $ 300 per filer. But now, only filers who itemize can deduct their charitable contributions. "That doesn't exist in 2022," said Tom O'Saben, director of tax content and government relations for the National Association of Tax Professionals.
At the same time, taxpayers are facing what will probably be another tax season with subpar customer service from the I.R.S. -- this after enduring two seasons of pandemic-fueled disruptions at the agency.
The I.R.S. is "poised to start the 2023 filing season in a stronger position," thanks to a reduced backlog of paper tax returns and newly expanded staff, according to a report to Congress this week from Erin M. Collins, the national taxpayer advocate. Ms. Collins heads a group within the Internal Revenue Service that works on behalf of taxpayers.
There is "light at the end of the tunnel," Ms. Collins said in the report. But the new workers must be trained, taking experienced staff away from their main jobs and creating a "difficult balancing act" that will probably delay significant change until midyear, Ms. Collins said. That is well after the April federal tax filing deadline. "In the short run," she said, "that may mean fewer employees are assisting taxpayers."
Filers should "do everything they can" to file returns electronically, check returns for accuracy and arrange for direct deposit of refunds to avoid delays, Ms. Collins said in an interview. Last year, her report said, refunds for paper returns were delayed by six months or more.
The I.R.S. said in an announcement on Thursday that it expected taxpayers to experience improvements this tax season, and that most people who file electronically should get a refund within 21 days.
Here are some questions and answers about the tax filings season:
When does tax filing season officially begin?
The I.R.S. will begin accepting returns on Jan. 23.
When is the federal tax filing deadline this year?
Tax day this year for most filers is Tuesday, April 18, since the traditional April 15 deadline falls on a Saturday and the next Monday is a holiday in Washington, D.C. Some filers, like those in federal disaster areas, including victims of the recent storms in California, will get extra time to file.
I sold a used item online last year. Will I get a form 1099-K?
A policy change would have required digital payment services like Venmo and PayPal to report transactions over $ 600 to the I.R.S., raising concern that casual online sellers would receive 1099-K forms reporting the sale, even if their transactions aren't taxable. Because of a backlash from lawmakers and an uproar from small-business owners, the agency postponed the change until next year. (The rule still applies, but just to sellers with more than 200 transactions totaling over $ 20,000.) If you get a 1099-K, Mr. O'Saben said, "don't ignore it." Try to determine why you received it, he said, and consider consulting a tax professional to help decide if you should report the amount as income.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: I was seduced by Cate Blanchett in "Tár." The 1980s ecological disaster in "White Noise" felt eerily familiar to me in our time of climate change. I was struck by how dark Guillermo del Toro's "Pinocchio" was compared with the Disney animated version I saw as a child in South Jersey in the early 1960s.
As I do every year, I'll tune in to the Golden Globes tonight and the Oscars in March. I'll be curious to find out if my picks will win best picture or other awards.
Many people enjoy movies. But people are often surprised that I do, too, because I am legally blind. I don't watch a film the way a sighted person does, but the experience opens up a whole world for me.
Like many other people who are legally blind, as I have been my whole life, I do have some vision. I see colors, I see motion, and I see faces, though I may not recognize whose faces they are unless they are very near. I can write on my iPad and computer and read on my Kindle if I enlarge the font enough. I can watch movies or TV if I'm close to the screen.
I owe my movie-maven status to my mom and dad, now deceased. They loved me. They hadn't met any blind or low-vision people before I was born, and maybe because of that, they never set rigid boundaries on what I should or shouldn't do. "We wanted you to do and enjoy as much as possible what the other kids did," my mother told me. And so the movies.
Yearly, my folks took me to see an ophthalmologist. He was a kind man who saw the whole me, not just a pair of bad eyes. "Her vision will always be impaired," he said to my folks, "but Kathi's still learning to use the vision she has."
Watching movies, the good doctor advised, would encourage me to take in images. To look at people's faces and gestures. To notice what landscapes, houses and other spaces and places look like.
My parents, film buffs, needed no encouragement to expose me to the silver screen. In my small town, every Saturday afternoon, kids lined up to go to the matinee at the local movie theater. Quarter in hand, I went with my pals to see the latest picture along with the trailers and cartoons that preceded it.
My grandmother would tell me to smile when she took my picture, but I had no idea what a smile looked like. I didn't know what my dad was talking about when he'd tell me not to curl my lip. I was later thrilled to discover what smiling and dancing looked like when I saw Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews in "Mary Poppins." I shivered as I looked into the deliciously evil eyes of Cruella de Vil in "101 Dalmatians."
At the movies, for the first time, close to the giant silver screen, I could see clenched fists, grimaces, smiles, nods and other expressions and gestures. Back in the day, I would have had no idea of what a life hack was. But that's what movies have been for me.
In real life, I frequently have trouble reading the room because I rarely see facial expressions, gestures or what people are wearing unless I'm very close to them. I frequently miss visual information that gives sighted people clues about the people they date, fall in love with, marry, parent, socialize with and work with. I can't see how you gesture to get a server's attention when you're having dinner out or when you're flirting with me or rolling your eyes.
I won't pretend that I see what sighted people see when they view movies, but I see enough. I also sometimes use audio description, a form of narration that gives blind and low-vision people access to visual elements in movies and other media.
Yes, a lot of the time I can't tell what weapon is used in a murder mystery or the size of the engagement ring a lover has hidden in his beloved's dessert. But the sheer experience of film is what I love -- the sense of images moving across the screen as we move through space and time. And because movies are on a big screen, with close-ups of lovers, musical numbers, battles and street scenes, I'm able to view what I otherwise rarely can.
My everyday life, like that of everyone I've ever known, isn't like the movies. I'm not, like Norma Desmond, getting ready for my close-up. I've had some lovely romances but never as magical as in "The Philadelphia Story." I have moments of existential dread. But I'm not Laurence Olivier in "Hamlet."
Yet the imaginary world of the movies has helped me by giving me irreplaceable, even magical glimpses into how the world works. From watching films, I got my first idea of what people were talking about when they said someone was smirking, snarling or shrugging. Today I'm not bewildered if I'm asked to smile for a photo. One day, I'll learn how to roll my eyes.
Movies have been a decoder ring that helped me make sense of the world. They've taught me to go beyond -- to picture beyond the rainbow and wild moonlight and even to take pride in how I see them in ways not everyone does. A blur, the need to get really close, to pay exquisite attention can be beautiful.

Adam Rich, 54, Magnetic Star as Child on 'Eight Is Enough': [Biography]

Full text: After gaining popularity as a symbol of innocence on TV in the 1970s, he struggled with drugs and depression. He later became a mental health advocate.
Adam Rich, a former child actor who starred in the hit television series "Eight Is Enough" in the 1970s and '80s, then dropped out of show business, dealt with serious depression and later re-emerged as a commentator on mental health, died on Saturday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 54.
Danny Deraney, Mr. Rich's publicist, confirmed the death. The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner did not immediately list a cause on its website.
"Eight Is Enough," combining gentle comedy with moments of drama, aired on ABC from 1977 to 1981. Dick Van Patten played Tom Bradford, a newspaper columnist with eight children, with Mr. Rich as the youngest of the brood, Nicholas. His helmet of shiny golden brown hair and innocent demeanor won him the affection of the audience.
The show, set in Sacramento and based on a memoir by Tom Braden, a newspaperman with eight children, depicted genuine family drama, like the death of the children's mother (played by Diana Hyland) from cancer after only four episodes. (The father later remarries.) But "Eight Is Enough" more often concerned everyday matters. In one episode, a minor-league baseball player whom Nicholas looks up to becomes attracted to one of his older sisters.
In 1977, The New York Times wrote that "Eight Is Enough" was one of "the better productions" on television and a major factor in ABC's becoming "the new prime time champion."
A 1991 profile of Mr. Rich in People magazine called him an "audience favorite" and quoted Mr. Van Patten as describing his "magnetism" as an actor.
Yet, as Mr. Rich said in a YouTube interview posted in 2021, he came to resent the typecasting parts available to him on TV compared with meatier roles being offered to other actors around his age, like River Phoenix.
Mr. Rich, by his own account, was drinking and experimenting with drugs before he turned 13. In 1986, he dropped out of Chatsworth High School in California, where he had studied acting. He stopped accepting job offers and would tell his agent, "I'm on vacation," People magazine wrote.
In 1991, Mr. Rich was arrested on suspicion of smashing the window of a Los Angeles pharmacy with a tire iron and slipping inside to steal morphine, People reported. Prosecutors said that moments earlier he had been denied painkillers at a nearby hospital emergency room.
Mr. Rich called Mr. Van Patten, his TV father, who posted bail, but within 24 hours Mr. Rich was arrested again, charged with shoplifting sunglasses and socks from a department store.
By the time he was 22, Mr. Rich had been in rehab five times. An overdose put him in a coma for two weeks. In the press, he was often grouped together with other sitcom child stars who as adults had spun into drug use and petty crime.
In 2000, Mr. Rich appeared in several scenes of Dave Eggers's popular memoir "A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius." In one passage, Mr. Eggers describes the uncanny experience of seeing Mr. Rich, whom he considered a celebrity, working the room in a dingy San Francisco nightclub.
Recalling his youth, Mr. Rich described his heedless philosophy of life at the time in an interview with People: "Yesterday's a canceled check, and tomorrow's a promissory note, but today is cash. Today is all you can really bank on."
Adam Rich was born on Oct. 12, 1968, in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn. His mother, Francine, acted as "the enforcer" during Adam's child acting days, Mr. Rich said; his father, Robert, was a mechanic for the Ford Motor Company. The family moved to California during Adam's early childhood. He soon began acting and became a popular choice for commercials.
Information about his survivors was not immediately available.
Mr. Rich was in his early 30s when he began treatment for depression. He struggled to find the right medication, but in 2020 he began posting about mental health on Twitter, where he gained a modest following.
In the YouTube interview, he emphasized that clinical depression was not a mood but an illness that could be traced to brain chemistry.
"I feel like this disease may kill me," he said, "but I feel like if I'm going out, I want to go out sort of fighting for somebody that may come behind me."

The G.O.P. Is Getting It Wrong About DeSantis: [Op-Ed]

Full text: Engulfed in turmoil in Washington, D.C., and the humiliation and setbacks of their party leaders, Republicans can be forgiven for looking elsewhere for a savior. Former President Donald Trump was, until those final minutes, largely ineffective in getting his ideological offspring to make Kevin McCarthy speaker, and so hopeful eyes have turned yet again to that other Floridian.
"Wanna know who looks good right now and focusing on his state, constituents and staying out of the chaos and mayhem?" Meghan McCain tweeted. "DeSantis. DeSantis looks good right now."
"Ron DeSantis looks like a grown-up here, and an adult," a former Trump adviser, David Urban, said on CNN the night Mr. McCarthy finally got the votes, "where the Washington Republicans are kind of in a quagmire."
Being smart enough to stay out of the hot mess in the House is hardly the sign of political genius, but there is no doubt the newly re-elected governor of Florida has the wind at his back. After his commanding performance in the midterm elections, I informally polled my conservative family members in Miami, who all said they had dumped Mr. Trump and were on team DeSantis for '24. One colorfully called the former president she had voted for twice a "whiny crybaby" who could only talk about losing the last election. Ouch.
The case for Mr. DeSantis, according to them, isn't just that he looks comparatively sage next to Mr. Trump. It's also that he spoke out early against lockdowns and has overseen a growing economy. Florida now has the fastest-growing population in the country, a factoid that Mr. DeSantis's spokesman, Jeremy Redfern, immediately touted after it was announced. "People vote with their feet," he said. "We are proud to be a model for the nation, and an island of sanity in a sea of madness."
Most criticism of Mr. DeSantis's national electability has been centered around his lack of charisma, which Mr. Trump crystallized by giving him the cumbersome nickname Ron DeSanctimonious. But focusing on personality and style obscures the governor's real failings: Florida is not a model for the nation, unless the nation wants to become unaffordable for everyone except rich snowbirds.
While my home state's popularity might indeed seem like good news for a governor with presidential ambitions, a closer look shows that Florida is underwater demographically. Most of those flocking there are aging boomers with deep pockets, adding to the demographic imbalance for what is already one of the grayest populations in the nation. This means that Florida won't have the younger workers needed to care for all those seniors. And while other places understand that immigrants, who often work in the service sector and agriculture, two of Florida's main industries, are vital to replenishing aging populations, Mr. DeSantis and the state G.O.P. are not exactly immigrant-friendly, enacting legislation to limit the ability of people with uncertain legal status to work in the state.
All of the new arrivals have contributed to a growing unaffordability crisis in Florida. You can see it everywhere, but I noticed it most distinctly on a recent visit to the waterfront in the popular neighborhood of Coconut Grove in South Florida. Over the holidays, I went to what had once been a beloved bar and casual restaurant called Scotty's Landing. It had been one of the few affordable places left to have a bite on Biscayne Bay, and it's where I had spent many Sundays listening to live music while sitting on white plastic chairs, eating fried fish sandwiches. It is now home to a vast complex centered on a high-end restaurant inspired by the motto "vacation as a state of mind" topped by an Instagramable sign flashing "Miami" in neon lights. Eighty-year-old wooden bungalows nearby now go for almost $ 2 million, and glitzy new projects have moved into historically Black neighborhoods like Little Haiti, pushing out local people.
While Mr. DeSantis has been busy limiting what can be taught in schools, flying immigrants to Northern states and punishing "woke" Disney, working-class Floridians are being priced out of many Florida cities. Miami now surpasses Los Angeles and New York City as the least-affordable city for housing in the United States, and joining it in the top five is the once working-class South Florida Cuban-American bastion of Hialeah. Miami is also second in income inequality, with levels roughly comparable with Colombia's and Panama's. Rents are soaring across many other parts of the state as well. And health care costs are unbearably high compared with those in other parts of the country because workers in the state have to shoulder a higher percentage of premiums.
The fact is, Florida is having many of the same problems as its liberal archnemesis California, and its Republican-led State Legislature is doing little to help less-affluent families thrive. More than 76 percent of Floridians live on the coasts, but in an era of fierce storms due to climate change and rising sea levels, many can't afford or even qualify for insurance for their homes, especially those who live in older buildings or in low-income areas. Lawmakers in Tallahassee ended the year giving insurance companies a huge bailout but doing little to reduce insurance costs for homeowners.
Of course, not all of this is Mr. DeSantis's fault. But those wanting to anoint him as the next great hope of the Republican Party should take a minute. Mr. DeSantis may look attractive now compared with the mess in Congress, but the Florida he has overseen is anything but paradise.

Analysts Look to Corporate Reports With Lowered Expectations: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: As companies prepare to publish their latest financial results, Wall Street forecasters expect profits to fall for the first time since the early days of the pandemic.
The analysts who forecast the fortunes of corporate America have rarely been more pessimistic at the start of a year than they are in 2023.
The country's largest companies are about to start publicly reporting their quarterly financial results, when analysts will pepper company management with questions about profits and losses and try to glean hints about what to expect in the months ahead. Coming after the S&P 500-stock index fell nearly 20 percent last year, these reports could help buoy the market if things aren't as bad as they seem, or drag it down further.
On Friday, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and others will set the tone, providing a window on the state of the economy, consumer confidence and business activity in their financial releases.
Wall Street's prognosticators predict that companies in the S&P 500 are about to reveal an aggregate fall in profit of about 4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, versus the same period a year ago, according to FactSet, the first decline since the early days of the pandemic. They also expect earnings to continue falling in the first half before rebounding to finish up 4 percent for the full year, according to data collected by Goldman Sachs going back to 1986.
That may not sound so bad, yet it stands out as the lowest forecast in recent history. That's worse than was expected at the beginning of 2009, shortly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and worse than at the start of 2002, as the dot-com bubble was rapidly deflating.
Analysts are balancing soaring inflation and interest rates against a resilient economy and some signs that inflation has peaked. They also tend to be a preternaturally optimistic bunch, so their not-so-great expectations are still cause for alarm for those who parse earnings forecasts, price targets and other ephemera produced by market watchers on Wall Street.
"It tells you expectations are already low," said Ben Snider, an equity analyst at Goldman Sachs. "I don't want to paint a picture that analysts are overly pessimistic. I think the estimates are reflecting what is a mediocre growth environment."
For months, investors have been waiting for the bottom to fall out for corporate America. The rising costs of everything from energy to raw materials and labor stoked fears that profitability would plummet. However, many companies have been able to pass on higher costs to consumers without denting their sales, propping up profit margins and generating cash to spend on operations or dividends and share buybacks, which directly benefit investors.
That may be about to change.
Amazon is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings that are almost 50 percent less than the year before. Expectations for profits at Alphabet, Apple, Meta and Microsoft, which have an outsize impact on stock indexes because of their size, have also dropped, according to the FactSet. Big technology firms have laid off tens of thousands of workers in recent weeks.
However, all that information is immediately reflected in stock prices, or so the theory goes. That's why investors and analysts pay such close attention to comments by corporate executives about how they see the future panning out, even if earnings calls are ostensibly held to talk about the past.
On these calls, analysts mix praise of management with pointed questions about the feasibility of their strategies. The discussion this quarter will probably focus on the effects of high inflation and interest rates, the likelihood of recession, and layoffs. Investors will also been listening for signals about the effect of China's reopening as well as the impact of new taxes on corporate income.
And investors are wise to the common practice of executives talking down their companies' prospects, giving themselves wiggle room for underperformance or simply a lower bar to beat and boost to their company's stock price.
"Recent client conversations indicate some skeptical investors are wary that managements might low-ball" their latest results and the outlook for 2023, Goldman's analysts wrote in a recent research note.
Yet there is also reason to be genuinely cautious.
Inflation remains stubbornly high, so the Federal Reserve is expected to keep raising interest rates, tightening the screws on the economy. Central bank officials have been adamant that the economy needs to soften in order to bring down inflation, and that implies more layoffs and weaker consumer demand, which makes it harder for companies to raise prices.
This week, the Walt Disney Company announced changes to its pricing policy at theme parks, an acknowledgment that it may have pushed too hard in pursuit of profit, while FedEx said it would further pare back some weekend delivery services as demand waned for its services.
"Big picture, we care about what is happening with demand and what is happening to companies' costs," said Ron Temple, the chief market strategist at Lazard.
Goldman's analysts don't expect earnings of companies in the S&P 500 to grow at all this year, a more downbeat forecast than the average. The bank itself laid off up to 3,200 people this week.
The biggest risk for companies and the stock market remains the Fed's campaign to constrain the economy and lower inflation, potentially pushing the economy into recession. Goldman's analysts see a potential earnings decline of more than 10 percent this year in that scenario.
"What worries me is that there is this sense that we may still come through this period with very little going wrong," Mr. Temple said. "There is too much complacency."

They Won Guantánamo’s Supreme Court Cases. Where Are They Now?

In the frantic aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, hundreds of men captured abroad were sent to the U.S. military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, where they were held without access to lawyers and denied all other rights.
In time, the cases of three of the prisoners reached the Supreme Court and made history. Their challenges changed the legal landscape at Guantánamo and stripped the military and the White House of unchecked authority to detain people here.
We caught up with two of the men, one in a gray industrial town in central England where he grew up, the other a thousand miles away in the sun-splashed Riviera in France. The third is struggling in war-torn Yemen.
All three former prisoners were reunited with their families years ago and managed to build new lives despite the abuse they endured and the stigma of having been held at Guantánamo.
“It’s hard,” said Lakhdar Boumediene, who lost more than seven years in U.S. detention, where he was found to be unlawfully held. “They took my time, my family.”
Their stories still matter today. About 780 men and boys were taken to Guantánamo, all by the George W. Bush administration, beginning 21 years ago on Jan. 11, 2002. Of them, 35 prisoners remain. Some still have court cases that challenge the legal limits of the war against terrorism and continue to shape its legacy.
Here are the accounts of two of the men whose cases prevailed at the Supreme Court.
His Case Gave Prisoners Access to Lawyers
Shafiq Rasul never saw a lawyer during his 800 days in U.S. detention, even though the case that bears his name gave detainees access to legal counsel.
By the time the justices ruled in Rasul v. Bush in June 2004, the United States had repatriated him to his native England with four other British citizens. The case went forward because other men on the petition were still being held at the island prison.
Today, Rasul, 45, lives with his wife, their two children and his widowed mother in the same row house along Victoria Road in Tipton, England, where he was raised. Two of his brothers live with their families in adjoining houses in the former factory town of brick buildings and bygone canals.
A soft-spoken man, Rasul describes himself as a homebody who earns a living by servicing natural gas home heating systems for a locally based national firm.
“I just keep to myself and busy all the time,” he said.
His employers know he was held by the U.S. military, he said, and sometimes he thinks people recognize him as one of three Muslims from Tipton who were held at Guantánamo for two years without being charged. But no one discusses it anymore.
In his first years of freedom, he participated in a British docudrama, “The Road to Guantánamo,” which recounts the foolish journey he and three 20-something friends from central England undertook to Pakistan and then, out of curiosity, to Afghanistan.
They arrived in Kandahar the day the U.S. bombings began in reprisal for the Sept. 11 attacks.
“It was just stupid,” he said. “Buses were moving to and from Afghanistan,” and the four joined a journey from a mosque, he said, to see the work of the Taliban firsthand. One friend was separated from the group and vanished, long ago presumed dead in the bombings. “There was a lot of naivete,” Rasul said.
The three of them tried to flee the fighting, but they were rounded up by Afghan militiamen allied with the Americans. By early 2002, they were discovered to be British citizens, handed over to U.S. troops and airlifted to Guantánamo’s crude Camp X-Ray compound.
They were returned to England nearly three years later, and Rasul became one of the first former prisoners to campaign against the wartime prison.
Interest in his story took him far from home — to Berlin, Japan and back to Pakistan in 2005 to film a portion of the movie.
While he was there, he met his future wife, Kafia. Theirs was an arranged marriage. Finding a wife in England was hard. “When they heard you were in Guantánamo ... ” Rasul said, his voice trailing off.
They have two children: a daughter, Khadijah, 13; and a son, Zayd, 12, who view their father’s time in U.S. custody as something fleeting and mostly forgotten. It was only after their father dug out some letters he wrote to his mother from detention that they realized he had been held for years and not the days that they had come to imagine.
His time in U.S. custody, Rasul said, made him more devout.
“I don’t think I’d be as religious as I am now,” he said. “I didn’t see it as a prison. I saw it as a madrassa, a place to learn Islam.”
He learned to speak Arabic there and made the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca seven years ago.
He also gained inner strength, he said, and survival skills after withstanding beatings and other abuses, and he returned home with a sense of duty to the men he left behind.
For a time, Rasul said, he had nightmares of the sounds of guards dragging shackles along the metal cell blocks at Camp Delta. But those plague him no longer. He has had no formal therapy, but he believes weeks of conversations that he and other prisoners had with Gareth Peirce, a human rights lawyer who documented their detention, had a therapeutic aspect.
It was during that period, back in England, when the Supreme Court ruled in his favor in the case, which his mother had filed for him.
The decision would open the spigot to visits by hundreds of lawyers, most volunteers, and, in time, habeas corpus petitions by prisoners contesting their detentions.
By then, lawyers for the British prisoners were compiling accounts of their abuse for a lawsuit against senior U.S. military leaders. U.S. courts rejected the civil suit. But the British government paid out a multimillion-dollar settlement to 16 Guantánamo prisoners, including Rasul, who blamed British intelligence agents for some of their mistreatment.
Two years after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Rasul, it dealt the Bush administration another blow in the case of Salim Ahmed Hamdan v. Donald H. Rumsfeld, who was then the secretary of defense. Hamdan was charged with war crimes for serving as Osama bin Laden’s driver and bodyguard in Afghanistan. But in June 2006, the court struck down as unconstitutional the military tribunal that was created at Guantánamo to try Hamdan.
The Bush administration crafted a new court, this time with the approval of Congress, and in 2008, a panel of U.S. military officers convicted Hamdan. But he was sentenced to a short term and, with time served, he was back in his native Yemen before Bush, whose administration he had challenged, left office. A higher court overturned that conviction in 2012.
Hamdan, now 54, was reunited with his wife and two daughters, one of whom was born after his capture, and his two sons, who were born after his return to Yemen, a nation devastated by civil war. We were unable to reach him.
His Case Gave Detainees Meaningful Court Review
In the years since Lakhdar Boumediene won his freedom, he has struggled to start over. He has done factory work and by his own account was nearly defeated trying to navigate France’s social welfare system to obtain respiratory care for his sickly newborn son. He has co-written a memoir and become a grandfather.
Today, Boumediene, 56, is an Uber driver on the French Riviera, shuttling tourists along the Mediterranean among Nice, Saint-Tropez and Monaco in a hybrid Peugeot sedan purchased with donations from people who heard his story.
On a good day, he is home by late afternoon with fruit from the market and a few euros for the Disney character banks of his youngest daughters, ages 8 and 10.
His son, Yousef, is now a healthy 12-year-old soccer enthusiast. Two older daughters born before Guantánamo both have children, and sometimes the entire family crams into his four-room, state-supported apartment in Carros, a hillside village north of Nice.
But between the hustle to make ends meet, he is still bewildered by the injustice of it all.
Boumediene, an Algerian, said he never trained with or joined al-Qaida. Allegations that he was involved in a plot to attack the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo, Bosnia, proved unfounded. The Islamic Red Crescent had sent him there with his family to administer a charity for orphans “over a thousand miles away from the battlefield in Afghanistan,” the U.S. judge who ordered his release noted.
Yet Bosnian authorities handed him and five others over to the U.S. military in 2002 for what became an odyssey of humiliation, hunger strikes and abuse.
“I lost 7 1/2 years,” he said on a weekday afternoon in winter, the Riviera’s slow season, as his youngest daughters spilled into the sitting room after school for hugs and kisses.
On this day, six of his children and grandchildren, who range in age from a toddler to 27-year-old, supervised the little ones or played on the fringes of an interview with Boumediene and his wife, Abassia Bouadjmi, who stood by him throughout his time in prison.
“I would travel across the ocean for my husband,” she said of the distance Guantánamo put between them. When her husband was taken away, she and the girls returned to family in Algeria.
Then, under a resettlement agreement between the Obama administration and the French government, they were reunited in Paris. Boumediene was first taken to a military hospital to strengthen his frail body while his wife and his oldest daughters, Raja and Rahma, waited for him to be well enough to travel to the south of France, where his sister-in-law lived.
He spoke about his time at Guantánamo with a mix of bewilderment and indignation. He said his guards were trained to believe he was a terrorist and expressed interest in just three things: food, sports and sex. He began a hunger strike, he said, after seeing a guard siphoning off food rations intended for the prisoners.
For about two years, Boumediene refused to consume anything but a nutritional supplement, which at times was fed to him through a tube snaked up his nose and into his stomach, a common practice at the time at Guantánamo.
He was direct about what he thinks should happen now. He wants a letter of apology from the United States — and reparations.
On one level, he said, the landmark 2008 case Boumediene v. Bush means a federal judge can independently evaluate the U.S. military’s basis for holding an enemy combatant at Guantánamo. “But me, I am a person who represents this principle,” he said.
Then, he pulled out two artifacts from his time at Guantánamo. One was a copy of the ruling that, after the Supreme Court decision, ordered his release.
In it, Judge Richard Leon found that the Bush administration had insufficient evidence to hold him, a never-charged detainee, based on “so thin a reed” as an uncorroborated claim from an “unnamed source” that was included in a classified document.
The other was a white T-shirt he wore under his tan prison-issued uniform toward the end of his detention. After the judge ruled in his favor, he used prison art supplies to adorn it with a secret message.
It said, “Boumediene 2, Bush 0.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

The 'Trump of the Tropics' Goes Bust: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: SÃO PAULO, Brazil -- As a shocked nation watched live on television and social media, thousands of radical supporters of a defeated president marched on the seat of the federal government, convinced that an election had been stolen. The mob ransacked the Congress, the Supreme Court and the presidential palace. It took the authorities several hours to arrest hundreds of people and finally restore order.
Hopefully, that was the last act for the bolsonaristas, extremist supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who was once called the Trump of the Tropics. Yet, as with the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump, it is unclear if this is the end of a political movement or just the beginning of more division and chaos.
The new president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, already faced a difficult challenge to unite his divided country, even without a bombastic former president just offstage and many of his supporters now prone to violence. Bringing those responsible for the attack to justice is a vital place to start.
On Jan. 1, Mr. Lula was sworn in to his third term as president of Brazil in a ceremonial inauguration in the capital -- but Mr. Bolsonaro didn't attend. He was supposed to pass the presidential sash to Mr. Lula as a sign of a peaceful transition of power. Instead, he opted to spend the last days of his presidency and the first weeks of Mr. Lula's administration in Orlando, Fla., at a house near Disney World.
Yet in the days since his defeat many of Mr. Bolsonaro's supporters have camped outside military bases around the country, figuring that the former president would pull together a last-minute plan. "We don't know the date, we don't know what will happen, we don't know where, we only trust our president," one of the protesters told me.
In the end, nothing happened, so some members of the mob took matters into their own hands.
Over the last two years, Mr. Bolsonaro repeatedly made baseless claims that the electoral system could be manipulated. When Mr. Bolsonaro said there were only three alternatives for his future -- prison, death or victory -- he did not mention a fourth option: go eat fried chicken in the United States, which he was photographed doing in December. In the end, the necessary components for a successful insurrection just weren't there. The defeated president had neither the institutional nor the public support he needed to jolt the military into taking his side.
For a start, he lacked allies. As soon as Mr. Bolsonaro's electoral loss was announced, some of his political allies congratulated the new president-elect. Other Latin American presidents did the same. Joe Biden's congratulations came late on election night and were heralded in the Brazilian media as important endorsements of the fairness of the electoral process.
Most important, Mr. Bolsonaro's defeat provoked a much softer outcry among his voters than was feared -- although it was still disruptive. Thousands of his supporters blocked roads and set vehicles on fire in an attempt to paralyze the country. Hundreds of others decided to place tents in front of army barracks across the country, pressuring for military intervention in the government. "S.O.S. armed forces," they screamed, often alternating martial slogans with Holy Marys and the national anthem.
A few weeks later, all roads had been cleared. Some camps remained, including one in the Santana neighborhood here in São Paulo. On Christmas, I spent part of my afternoon talking to a dozen Bolsonaro supporters camped there. They still believed that the elections had been rigged. The strongest evidence came in the form of a question: "If everybody is here, why has the minority won?"
They insisted to me that Mr. Lula wouldn't be sworn in on Jan. 1. "We are certain that he won't," said a woman in her 70s. (The people I spoke to declined to give their names out of fear for their safety.) When I asked what might happen instead, the woman hinted at two possible outcomes: Either the military would be called to support a presidential coup just as the bolsonaristas wanted, or the "good citizens" would take to the streets -- also allegedly under Mr. Bolsonaro's instructions -- to ensure that he stayed in power.
Mr. Lula's administration, a broad coalition of democratic forces, will lead the country to communism, the protesters told me. That's why they called for military intervention while interpreting possible secret messages that the president has tapped to them in Morse code. (Yes, they've spent some time trying to decipher the drumming of Mr. Bolsonaro's fingers on a desk during his last livestream.)
The truth is that Mr. Bolsonaro's political capital has dwindled. When he left the country, his vice president, Gen. Hamilton Mourão, told the nation: "The alternation of power in a democracy is healthy and must be preserved." He also made a blunt reference to "leaders who were supposed to reassure and unite the nation around a project for the country" but who had instead fomented a climate of chaos and social collapse. Ouch. It appears that even the armed forces just want a calm transition to power so they can remain a privileged class without too many responsibilities.
Some of Mr. Bolsonaro's former allies in Congress now support Mr. Lula, and the former president's Digital Popularity Index, which is tracked by a consulting firm, has fallen more than half since its peak.
But hard-core bolsonaristas aren't to go quietly. Only on Monday did they remove their tents from outside military barracks in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and other cities. In Brasília, the authorities dismantled the camp and detained 1,200 people. The demonstrators have been waiting for more than two months for a miracle to happen. When it didn't, they tried to take the government by force.
In response, Mr. Lula signed an emergency decree allowing the federal government to intervene and restore order to the capital. It will remain in effect until the end of the month. The federal district governor was temporarily removed from his post by a Supreme Court judge. A criminal investigation has been opened to identify the rioters and their financial sponsors. On Monday, a member of Congress asked the government to request Mr. Bolsonaro's extradition.
Democracies need the rule of law to flourish. They also need a shared understanding that power must be transferred peacefully. Mr. Lula has his work cut out for him to hold his nation together. A good starting point will be to keep calm after these deplorable events and firmly follow the rites of justice to hold the culprits accountable.
For his part, Mr. Bolsonaro didn't speak out in support of the rioters. But he didn't ask them to go home, either, preferring to let them interpret his silence as they wish.

Crime and Police Shows Still Big Hits: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Prestige shows like "The White Lotus" grab a lot of the headlines and rave reviews. But viewers still like to settle in with the familiar.
Just a few years ago, it looked as though shows in which a group of characters confront and neatly resolve a crime or a court case in a single episode, a staple of TV since its earliest days, might not make the leap to the streaming future.
In the 2010s, as Netflix was ascendant, several hugely successful procedurals were shown the door. NBC unceremoniously canceled "Law & Order." CBS canceled "CSI," the popular police show, as well as three "CSI" spinoffs. Many television executives felt that a story told over the course of a whole season, like "Big Little Lies" or "House of Cards," would be better for Netflix-style binge watching.
As it turns out, those old-fashioned procedurals aren't just surviving, they are thriving, in a new medium.
The back libraries of network series like "Criminal Minds" (2005-2020), "NCIS" (2003 to present), "The Blacklist" (2013 to present) and "Bones" (2005-2017) are all among the most streamed shows since 2020, according to Nielsen's streaming ranker, which totals up series by the number of minutes watched.
In fact, "Criminal Minds" was the most-watched show in streaming in 2021, beating out shows considered cultural phenomena like "Squid Game," "The Great British Baking Show" and "Bridgerton." In 2022, "NCIS" was more watched than "Ozark" and the film "Encanto."
And "Law & Order"? It restarted last year.
Part of the reason the shows rank so high is that there are hundreds of episodes for viewers to watch. "Criminal Minds," for example, has more than 300 episodes, and it appears lots of viewers automatically play to the next episode, over and over again. Many of the most popular shows with a story arc that lasts a season or more have far fewer episodes. "Squid Game" has nine.
Part of the appeal is that the procedurals have a low barrier to entry. They are, to a fault, uncomplicated -- if viewers zone out or scroll through their phones, they won't be missing much; nor is there a need for an online recap or podcast to help decode intricate plot points.
David E. Kelley, the veteran producer of series like "Ally McBeal" and "The Practice," and now the creator of a show for Peacock, "The Calling," said that is a big draw.
"It only makes sense that a viewer is going to say: 'I want to watch something. I don't have time to watch 100 hours of it, or even 10 hours, but I want to commit to three, four hours to it. I want to feel like I had a whole meal,"' he said.
He continued: "You feel you've had the whole totality at least of the storytelling experience in three or four episodes, and then you can choose to go back to that restaurant or not for another meal."
Going back to the 1950s with "Dragnet," or the 1980s and '90s with "Murder: She Wrote" or the 2000s with "Law & Order: SVU," the procedural has survived technological shifts before.
Steven Binder, an executive producer of "NCIS," said he believed that older procedurals and other network-style dramas had a "universal appeal" that allowed them to thrive in streaming libraries.
"When I look at other shows in history that have been as popular as 'NCIS,' back to 'Gunsmoke' or 'Star Trek,' you've got characters on the show working together to solve problems," he said. "Our show isn't about the fighting between the characters."
He pointed out that Gene Roddenberry, the creator of "Star Trek," had a concept: no conflict among the Starfleet crew.
"It was groundbreaking back in the time when he said, 'No, we're not going to have our characters fighting each other -- they're all a team, and the conflict is going to come externally,"' he said. "That's what our show is: It's competent, capable people working together to solve problems. I think people have always liked seeing that. They're heroes."
George Cheeks, the president of CBS since 2020, who was a top NBC executive before that, noticed that "NCIS" and "Criminal Minds" were performing well on Netflix.
As a network executive, Mr. Cheeks said, people often asked him why he wasn't following the mid-2010s Netflix model where he could spend $ 10 million or more an episode for premium serialized dramas.
"I would always politely remind them," he said, "that these shows that you don't seem to think have value any more are demonstrating value both on broadcast TV and streaming."
The most popular shows on Paramount+, the home of popular streaming series like "Survivor" and "1923," are dominated by procedurals, with five series in its top 10 most watched list over the past few months, according to internal Paramount+ data, which was reviewed by The New York Times.
Series like "NCIS," "Criminal Minds," "Blue Bloods," "FBI" and "SEAL Team" are all in the top 10. Likewise, on free streaming services like Pluto, procedurals perform very strongly.
"There's a beginning, middle and end, and you don't have to have watched the prior episode to enjoy the current episode," Tom Ryan, a co-founder of Pluto TV and the president of streaming at Paramount, said on The Town podcast in October. "Lots of the content on Pluto that performs so well is just like that."
It also helps that the format travels well outside the United States. Mr. Cheeks said that "CSI," "NCIS" and "FBI" have high interest in international markets "in a way that streaming originals just don't."
When Mr. Cheeks saw that "Criminal Minds" was performing well on streaming, he urged restarting it for Paramount+. "Criminal Minds: Evolution" debuted in November, two years after the series was canceled on CBS. It will continue its weekly run on Paramount+ on Jan. 12.
And while the show has been slightly reimagined, the core story line remains.
"When you turn on 'Criminal Minds,' you know we're going to take you to the dark, we are going to scare you -- and then we're going to save you," said Erica Messer, an executive producer of "Criminal Minds: Evolution" who worked on the original iteration. "A lot has changed over the course of the 15-plus years the show's been on. But that hasn't changed.
"I think there's a comfort in knowing that I'm going to get really scared," she continued, "but I'm going to solve the mystery alongside these heroes."

Getting Rid of Remote Work Will Take More Than a Downturn: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: As the economy slows, a handful of prominent C.E.O.s have tried to put an end to remote work. But some economists say that even in a cooler labor market, working from home is likely to remain common.
The DealBook newsletter delves into a single topic or theme every weekend, providing reporting and analysis that offers a better understanding of an important issue in business. If you don't already receive the daily newsletter, sign up here .
During the nearly three years since pandemic precautions pushed remote work into the mainstream, companies have been negotiating a "new normal" in an environment that some say gives workers an upper hand: Hiring has been difficult, quitting has been popular, and employers had been in a good position to accommodate workers' preferences.
That era is over. While the labor market remains tight even as many forecast that the United States will fall into a recession, most economists expect more layoffs and fewer job openings in the coming months as companies rethink how they operate. This week, Amazon said it would cut 18,000 jobs, or about 6 percent of its corporate work force, and Salesforce said it planned to lay off 10 percent of its employees, or about 8,000 staff members. Goldman Sachs is preparing to lay off as many as 4,000 people.
As the workplace shifts, some prominent chief executives see an opportunity to get their employees back in the office. In May 2021, David Solomon, C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs, told workers to get ready to return the next month to encourage more in-person collaboration and shared culture. Elon Musk ended Twitter's "work from anywhere policy" in his first email to employees after acquiring the company last year, saying he would require them to work at least 40 hours a week from the office. Bob Iger stopped short of an office mandate when returning to Disney as chief executive in November, but he reportedly told employees that "I worry long term about the negative impact on people who have decided not to spend as much time at the office."
But is the pandemic-induced remote work experiment about to end? Economists studying the shift to more flexible workplaces say it is not likely despite the push by some of the world's most high-profile C.E.O.s.
Hybrid work is establishing itself as the new normal
Last year, remote work stabilized at well above prepandemic levels, according to data compiled by a group of researchers at Stanford University, the University of Chicago and Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México.
In 2019, around 5 percent of full paid working days in the United States were completed remotely, according to census data. But when the research group started gathering data for the U.S. Survey of Working Arrangements and Attitudes (S.W.A.A.), a monthly poll of workers, that proportion jumped to more than 60 percent in May 2020. For the past year, the percentage has been hovering around 30 percent.
"We are all back to prepandemic trends in online shopping, but permanently up on online work," said Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford and a co-author of the monthly survey.
The most common remote work situation, according to the S.W.A.A. and a number of other surveys, is now hybrid work, with employees spending some days in the office and some working remotely. Companies, industries and individual situations vary greatly on preferences and the feasibility of remote work, but on average, both sides have similar ideas about the ideal amount of time to spend in the office.
In the December S.W.A.A. survey, workers able to do their jobs from home said they preferred to operate remotely about 2.8 days per week. Their employers planned to allow them to work from home about 2.3 days per week. That's not a big gap in expectations.
There are obvious reasons employees say they like working remotely: They want to avoid the time and costs of commuting; they focus better without office chatter; they feel it's better for their well-being to be at home. When McKinsey, the consultancy, asked 12,000 job seekers last year about their reasons for looking for a new job, "flexible working" came in just behind "greater pay or hours" and "better career opportunities."
What often gets glossed over -- and one reason some economists believe that a recession would have little impact on the shift in working arrangements -- is that allowing employees to operate outside of the office can also benefit companies.
In a survey conducted by ZipRecruiter, the employment search site, job seekers on average said they would take a 14 percent pay cut in order to work remotely.
While the labor market remains strong, the economy is slowing down, and companies are looking for ways to make their jobs more valuable without raising pay. And many of them say they're using remote work to do it.
"It's not that there won't be some loss of bargaining power by workers," said Steven Davis, a professor at the University of Chicago and a co-author of the S.W.A.A. "It's just that many employers have their own independent reasons to think that the shift, the partial shift, to remote work is beneficial for them as well."
Managers are finding it hard to reverse the changes
For a working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Mr. Bloom, Mr. Davis and others asked the hundreds of senior business executives who are surveyed each month by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta if they had expanded remote work as a way to "keep employees happy and to moderate wage-growth pressures." Thirty-eight percent said they had done so in the past 12 months, including half of executives working in sectors such as finance, insurance, real estate and professional services. Forty-one percent said they planned to do so in the next year.
The authors used executives' estimates for how much they saved in pay by offering remote work to conclude that it would cut companies' salary bill by 2 percent over two years.
"That's not huge," Mr. Davis said. "But what it suggests is that there are non-trivial benefits to many firms from remote work."
A downturn could even make remote work more, not less, sticky. Recruiting more widely, including in cities where the cost of living is lower than where a company is headquartered, could mean paying lower salaries (though in some industries, such as tech, there is some evidence that salaries in different cities are converging).
Workers with an option to log in remotely may also take fewer sick days or decide to work remotely when they would previously have taken a day off to attend a friend's wedding or extend a holiday.
Of course, there are costs to remote work, too. Managers and workers often disagree about which environment is most productive. And working virtually can involve security considerations, new software purchases and compliance headaches around hiring in multiple states or countries. But, Mr. Davis said, in a lot of cases, companies have already paid for those costs. "We had almost three years of experience doing this," he said.
Perhaps the most practical reason that companies may hold on to remote work in a recession is that it is difficult to revoke. Even Musk, a little more than a week after mandating full-time office work, reportedly clarified that all that was required of employees who wanted to work remotely was an approval from a manager willing to take responsibility for ensuring excellent work (albeit at the risk of being fired).
"Many, many companies in recent months have insisted that people come back to the office five days a week, only to reverse that mandate within about a week after hearing that they'd lose their best and brightest," said Julia Pollak, the chief economist ZipRecruiter.
Remote work, Ms. Pollak added, "is not just used as a sort of perk in a tight labor market that's going to go away in a slacker labor market."

Once a Reluctant Actor, Now a Star: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A VHS tape of "Peter and the Wolf," the Disney animated short from 1946, played on repeat at home when Diego Calva was growing up in the 1990s.
Both terrified and tantalized by that first cinematic obsession as a child, Calva discovered the power of audiovisual storytelling in the unnerving leitmotif of the villainous wolf.
"Without being able to put in words, it made me realize that I was a little box of feelings and that movies could make them surface," Calva explained, speaking in Spanish. "That hooked me."
After only one major independent movie, the actor from Mexico City is now starring alongside Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie in his first mega-budget American production: the director Damien Chazelle's silent-era revel "Babylon," about the grotesque origins of the Hollywood film industry and why movies fascinate us.
Calva, 30, received a Golden Globe nomination for best actor in a musical or comedy for his performance as the Mexican-born Manny Torres, who slowly moves up the ranks in 1920s Hollywood -- from catch-all production assistant to influential producer.
His character functions as the story's driving force: as both the link between Pitt's and Robbie's characters -- two successful, often deranged actors -- and as the viewer's guide to this decadent world. Calva gives Manny an adoring naïveté about the movies, which fuels the character's determination to become a part of them, even if his devotion eventually backfires.
While Calva worked hard to win the part, performing wasn't his original dream. Long before Hollywood called, Calva had ambitions to become a writer-director, as he explained in an interview at a hotel in Beverly Hills. The tall, easygoing novice wore a preppy look composed of a gray sweater vest over a white T-shirt, black slacks and a pair of shiny black shoes.
From a young age, he surrounded himself with friends a few years older who were making short films. Like Manny, Calva helped out in miscellaneous positions behind the scenes of those independent shoots, whether it was catering or holding a boom mic.
On one such set, he was asked to step in for an actor who hadn't shown up, which led to more jobs, mostly unpaid, in front of the camera. He eventually landed his first lead in a feature film, appearing in the director Julio Hernández Cordón's 2015 gay drama "I Promise You Anarchy," a festival hit.
The story follows two male skateboarders in a tumultuous romance, as they become involved with criminals trafficking human blood on the black market.
On a friend's recommendation, Hernández Cordón checked out Calva's Facebook profile. Afterward, the director eagerly reached out to Calva, who had been skating since early adolescence.
"Within five minutes of meeting Diego, I knew he was the right person for the part because of his confidence and charisma," Hernández Cordón said on a video call from Mexico City.
While there was no formal casting process, Calva and his co-star, Eduardo Eliseo Martinez, had to agree to the intimate scenes in the screenplay. Their openness to portraying intense desire solidified the director's trust in them.
"I've always considered myself a bit punk and I love skating," Calva said, "so the movie was like bringing to life some situations I was already going through at the time."
As Hernández Cordón pointed out, Calva straddles the line between his middle-class upbringing, raised by a single mother who instilled in him an affinity for the arts, and the street smarts attained by wandering a large metropolis with kids from other socioeconomic backgrounds.
"I knew Diego had an innate talent, but I worried that he wouldn't realize the gift he has," Hernández Cordón said. "I'm very happy that he's starting a new chapter with 'Babylon."'
That introduction to performing professionally, however, didn't dazzle Calva enough to make him push his filmmaking aspirations aside.
He went on to enroll at the Centro de Capacitación Cinematográfica, one of Mexico's pre-eminent film schools, to study directing. But to stay afloat financially, Calva took on acting work, which created a conflict with the institution's policies.
Ultimately, he chose to leave the school and returned to acting full time, appearing on TV series and in supporting parts on the big screen, and putting on acting workshops for children.
It was during this period of doubt about his future that the opportunity to audition for the third season of the Netflix hit series "Narcos: Mexico" arrived. He aced it. And while playing the real-life drug lord Arturo Beltrán Leyva on the show introduced him to production on a larger scale, Calva couldn't anticipate what would soon come his way.
As Damien Chazelle searched, in late 2019, for a fresh face to star in "Babylon," he came across Calva's image amid a stack of headshots. The Oscar-winning director was struck by the actor's gaze.
"There was something of a dreamer in his eyes, something of a poet," Chazelle said via video. "But I had no idea if he could act."
The character he envisioned Calva for, Manny, is partly inspired by two Latin American filmmakers whose careers started to take off in the 1920s: Enrique Juan Vallejo, the Mexican cinematographer and director, and René Cardona, the prolific Cuban-born director.
Calva submitted several self-taped auditions and eventually met with Chazelle online during the early months of the Covid pandemic. The more intrigued Chazelle became by Calva, the more it also became apparent that the actor had limited experience and that his English needed work.
Chazelle and Olivia Hamilton, his wife and a producer of the film, "debated whether it was a gamble worth taking with Diego," Chazelle said. "She had this full 100 percent unwavering belief in him."
Several months into the casting process, Calva began to feel overwhelmed by the life-changing magnitude of the opportunity, which seemed closer to materializing but not yet certain. Aside from executing Chazelle's increasingly specific notes about his line delivery, improving his English became a priority.
In late 2020, Calva finally traveled to Los Angeles to meet with Chazelle and Robbie, who would play Nellie LaRoy, a fictional starlet and Manny's love interest.
Using his cellphone, Chazelle filmed the chemistry read between Calva and Robbie in his backyard. Their palpable energy convinced him that Calva could deliver on his potential.
"He had this kind of Al Pacino-level ability to command the camera without seeming to do anything," Chazelle said. In fact, Pacino's arc from innocence to corruption as Michael Corleone in "The Godfather" films served as a key reference for Calva's turn.
Robbie admired Calva's ability to improvise in his second language.
"It's so transformative to act with him because he's so present that you forget you're doing a scene," Robbie said. "He was the greatest scene partner I could ever wish for."
For Calva, the parallels between him and Manny feel almost like docu-fiction. "I identify with him in wanting to belong in the world of the movies," he said. The actor's wide-eyed reactions to an epic set piece early in the sweeping story came from genuine emotion.
"My first day on a Hollywood set was also the character's first day on a Hollywood set," Calva explained. "All of the expressions of surprise you see on my face are real."
By the time one of the final scenes was shot, in which Manny watches the musical "Singin' in the Rain" and cries, Calva had been immersed in the universe of Chazelle's movie for nearly eight months. For that emotional moment, the director asked him to replay "Babylon" in its entirety, from Manny's point of view, via facial expressions.
"It's such a crazy piece of direction, and he does it," Robbie said. "You feel everything you've felt for the last three hours play out on his face in a few seconds."
"I needed an actor who could really dig deep and summon something," Chazelle said. "It's the hardest kind of acting to do because you don't have the benefit of words, language or even body movement. You have to do it all just in your face, in your eyes."
As Manny rises in Hollywood, he loses perspective, even denying his Mexican identity and claiming to be from Spain. Calva, grounded in advice from his mother, whom he considers his best friend, said he believed that wouldn't happen to him.
"I don't want to lose my childlike outlook on life, my ability for wonder," Calva said. "I want to remember the road back home and know that if I make mistakes I won't lose myself."
For now, Calva plans to remain in Mexico City and build his burgeoning career, but whenever he's wanted on this side of the border, the actor will joyfully oblige.
"They invited me to this party," Calva said with a hint of mischievous glee. "Getting me out of Hollywood is going to be difficult."

Getting Rid of Remote Work Will Take More Than a Downturn

During the nearly three years since pandemic precautions pushed remote work into the mainstream, companies have been negotiating a “new normal” in an environment that some say gives workers an upper hand: Hiring has been difficult, quitting has been popular and employers had been in a good position to accommodate workers’ preferences.
That era is over. While the labor market remains tight even as many forecast that the United States will fall into a recession, most economists expect more layoffs and fewer job openings in the coming months as companies rethink how they operate. This past week, Amazon said it would cut 18,000 jobs, or about 6% of its corporate workforce, and Salesforce said it planned to lay off 10% of its employees, or about 8,000 staff members. Goldman Sachs is preparing to lay off as many as 4,000 people.
As the workplace shifts, some prominent CEOs see an opportunity to get their employees back in the office. In May 2021, David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs, told workers to get ready to return the next month to encourage more in-person collaboration and shared culture. Elon Musk ended Twitter’s “work from anywhere policy” in his first email to employees after acquiring the company last year, saying he would require them to work at least 40 hours a week from the office. Bob Iger stopped short of an office mandate when returning to Disney as CEO in November, but he reportedly told employees that “I worry long term about the negative impact on people who have decided not to spend as much time at the office.”
But is the pandemic-induced remote work experiment about to end? Economists studying the shift to more flexible workplaces say it is not likely despite the push by some of the world’s most high-profile CEOs.
Hybrid work is establishing itself as the new normal.
Last year, remote work stabilized at well above pre-pandemic levels, according to data compiled by a group of researchers at Stanford University, the University of Chicago and Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México.
In 2019, around 5% of full paid working days in the United States were completed remotely, according to census data. But when the research group started gathering data for the U.S. Survey of Working Arrangements and Attitudes (SWAA), a monthly poll of workers, that proportion jumped to more than 60% in May 2020. For the past year, the percentage has been hovering around 30%.
“We are all back to pre-pandemic trends in online shopping but permanently up on online work,” said Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford and a co-author of the monthly survey.
The most common remote work situation, according to the SWAA and a number of other surveys, is now hybrid work, with employees spending some days in the office and some working remotely. Companies, industries and individual situations vary greatly on preferences and the feasibility of remote work, but on average, both sides have similar ideas about the ideal amount of time to spend in the office.
In the December SWAA survey, workers able to do their jobs from home said they preferred to operate remotely about 2.8 days per week. Their employers planned to allow them to work from home about 2.3 days per week. That’s not a big gap in expectations.

When McKinsey, a consultancy, asked 12,000 job seekers last year about their reasons for looking for a new job, “flexible working” came in just behind “greater pay or hours” and “better career opportunities.”
What often gets glossed over — and one reason some economists believe that a recession would have little impact on the shift in working arrangements — is that allowing employees to operate outside the office can also benefit companies.

Full text: That downturn in streaming content that you've been hearing about? Not here yet.
There is a sea change coming to your TV screens, as shifting economics in the television and streaming video industries lead to a sudden decrease in the number of series competing for your limited attention and dollars. (Hold your applause.)
But not yet! This winter, the flood continues. The volume of notable shows is such that I didn't find room in this preview to list new seasons of series I enjoy like "Servant" (Apple TV+, Jan. 13), "Godfather of Harlem" (MGM+, Jan. 15), "Miracle Workers" (TBS, Jan. 16), "You" (Netflix, Feb. 9), "Star Trek: Picard" (Paramount+, Feb. 16) and "The Mandalorian" (Disney+, March 1). Here are the 24 new and returning shows that caught my eye, in chronological order; as always, dates are subject to change.
'Trigun Stampede'
The 1998 outer-space western "Trigun," which occasionally pops up on all-time-best anime lists, is reimagined by Orange, the studio behind the popular "Beastars" series on Netflix. The frenetic, peace-loving hero Vash of the desert planet No Man's Land returns along with his frenemy Meryl Stryfe, who's now a cub reporter. (Crunchyroll, Saturday. Another highly anticipated anime premiere: Season 2 of "Vinland Saga," Monday on Crunchyroll and Netflix.)
'Anne Rice's Mayfair Witches'
Wasting no time after the October premiere of "Anne Rice's Interview With the Vampire," AMC offers a second series based on Rice's supernatural tales. Alexandra Daddario plays a neurosurgeon unaware of her roots in New Orleans magic and debauchery. (AMC, Sunday)
'Detectorists'
Talk about a holiday gift: Five years after it ended its run, we get a bonus episode of Mackenzie Crook's melancholy comedy about friendship, disappointment, stubborn pride and the solace of walking around large empty fields wielding metal detectors. The 75-minute one-off catches up with Andy (Crook), Lance (the great Toby Jones) and the other members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, a small world where the stakes can get very high. (Acorn TV, Monday)
'Velma'
The non-canine protagonists of "Scooby-Doo" are reimagined in a highly self-referential prequel series centered on the brainy Velma Dinkley, voiced by Mindy Kaling. (HBO Max, Thursday)
'The Last of Us'
The conversation around this series from Craig Mazin ("Chernobyl") and the video game developer Neil Druckmann is about proving whether a really good live-action show can be made from a video game. (Apparently "Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?" didn't count.) Another question, of course, is how badly we need another series set after a zombie apocalypse. Pedro Pascal of "The Mandalorian" and Bella Ramsey of "Game of Thrones" star. (HBO, Jan. 15)
'Stonehouse'
What is it with British men and their painfully ill-fated attempts to fake their own deaths? Last year gave us "The Thief, His Wife and the Canoe" with Eddie Marsan as an angry prole who chose to paddle away from society. Now we have another estimable British actor, Matthew Macfadyen, as John Stonehouse, a member of Parliament who -- honey-trapped by the Czech secret service and an epic failure as a businessman -- assumed the identity of a dead constituent and absconded to Australia. (BritBox, Jan. 17)
'Zora Neale Hurston: Claiming a Space'
"American Experience" profiles a towering figure in 20th-century American literature and social science, in a documentary by Tracy Heather Strain ("Lorraine Hansberry: Sighted Eyes/Feeling Heart"). (PBS, Jan. 17)
'Night Court' and 'That '90s Show'
These revivals will be greeted with much good will, though what they might need is liniment. John Larroquette returns at 75 in "Night Court," with Melissa Rauch as the judge, who is the daughter of Harry Anderson's character from the original. Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith, 71 and 79, return in "That '90s Show" as the grandparents of the lead, a teenager played by Callie Haverda who's the daughter of the characters played by Laura Prepon and Topher Grace in "That '70s Show." (NBC, Jan. 17; Netflix, Jan. 19)
'Fauda'
The fourth season of the Israeli shoot-em-up thriller, which was shown in Israel this past summer, comes to the rest of the world. Wildly popular in some quarters for its orchestration of tension and mayhem, and condemned in others for its portrayal of Palestinians in the occupied territories, the show shifts much of its action in the new season to Brussels's Muslim district. (Netflix, Jan. 20)
'Extraordinary'
In her first series, the Northern Irish writer Emma Moran upends the superhero equation: Everyone has a power except her young heroine, Jen (Máiréad Tyers). Jen's angst is the focus, but the comic backdrop is the radical democratization of special abilities. Flight? A good way to escape an awkward date. Contacting the dead? Useful in probate court. (Hulu, Jan. 25)
'The 1619 Project'
The New York Times Magazine's examination of the centrality of slavery in American history has been adapted into a six-part documentary; Nikole Hannah-Jones, who won a 2020 Pulitzer Prize for the project, is the host. (The Times is a producer of the series.) (Hulu, Jan. 26)
'Poker Face'
Natasha Lyonne plays a roving do-gooder with a possibly supernatural ability to tell when people are lying in this retro crime-caper-drama-comedy-whatsit created by Rian Johnson of the "Knives Out" movies. The show is being compared, in advance, to "Columbo"; "Route 66" may also come to mind, and the first episode includes prominent nods to "Pulp Fiction" and "Burn Notice." (Peacock, Jan. 26)
'Wolf Pack'
Jeff Davis has had a TV career whose output is in inverse proportion to its success: He's been responsible for just two shows, the grisly CBS cash cow "Criminal Minds" and the stylish MTV supernatural drama "Teen Wolf." Both had intensely devoted followings, which probably barely overlapped. For his third series, he returns to teenage werewolves in California, in a young-skewing drama with Sarah Michelle Gellar and Rodrigo Santoro as the responsible adults. "Wolf Pack" is not connected to "Teen Wolf," which is likely to cause endless confusion, especially because Paramount+ is debuting the new series and Davis's "Teen Wolf: The Movie" on the same night. (Paramount+, Jan. 26.)
'The Upshaws'
In the wide Sargasso Sea of traditional family sitcoms, "The Upshaws," returning for its third season, is one of the funnier and more touching landfalls. Wanda Sykes, Mike Epps and Kim Fields play the putative authority figures in a fractious Indianapolis clan with an understated polish that doesn't slide over into the usual slickness. (Netflix, Feb. 16)
'Hello Tomorrow!'
Billy Crudup, Hank Azaria, Haneefah Wood and Dewshane Williams star as a crew selling timeshares on the moon -- "Glengarry Glen Ross" through a Ray Bradbury lens. This satirical sci-fi fantasy created by Amit Bhalla and Lucas Jansen ("Bloodline") is set in a retro-styled suburban future maintained by ungainly, hovering robots. (Apple TV+, Feb. 17)
'The Company You Keep'
Milo Ventimiglia segues from glossy soap opera in "This Is Us" to glossy crime drama, playing a high-class con man who hooks up with a C.I.A. agent (Catherine Haena Kim). One of the showrunners, Phil Klemmer, has a track record with shows that veer from the network norm: "Legends of Tomorrow," "Chuck" and "Veronica Mars." (ABC, Feb. 19)
'Snowfall'
This rabidly entertaining series, originally positioned as an exposé of government involvement in the crack-cocaine epidemic, has grown into a dark, operatic family drama. Its sixth and final season opens with Franklin (Damson Idris) pitted against his Aunt Louie (Angela Lewis) and Uncle Jerome (Amin Joseph) for survival in the South Central drug trade. (FX, Feb. 22)
'The Consultant'
Tony Basgallop, the creator of "Servant" on Apple TV+, goes creepy-comic again in this tech thriller set at a gaming company with a new boss (Christoph Waltz) whose management style redefines predatory capitalism. Brittany O'Grady from the first season of "The White Lotus" plays a personal assistant who's trying to figure out what he's up to. (Amazon, Feb. 24)
'Party Down'
The reboots of "Night Court" and "That '70s Show" are largely populated by new actors, but this critics' darling from 2009-10 is bringing back most of its cast for a third season that feels continuous despite the 13-year gap. Adam Scott, Ken Marino, Jane Lynch, Ryan Hansen, Megan Mullally and Martin Starr return; most of the characters no longer moonlight with the Hollywood catering company Party Down (at least at first), but they can't escape its orbit. (Starz, Feb. 24)
'Perry Mason'
Season 1 went through a strenuous, not entirely successful effort to complicate and darken the character from Erle Stanley Gardner's pulp novels; Mason was introduced as a cynical, alcoholic private eye before beginning to morph into the shrewd lawyer Gardner created. The 1930s Hollywood-noir atmosphere and Matthew Rhys's presence as Mason, though, argue for giving the second season a chance. (HBO, March 6)
'Shadow & Bone'
As dark (but not too dark) young-adult fantasy adventures go, this series, set in a martial world that blends elements of imperial Russia and Victorian England, is more than tolerable. The British actress Jessie Mei Li is appealing as the heroine, a cartographer who learns she has magical ability on an epic scale, which she is still trying to control in Season 2. (Netflix, March 16)
'Mrs. Davis'
Betty Gilpin of "Glow" joins forces with the writer and producer Damon Lindelof of "Watchmen," playing a nun doing battle with an omniscient artificial intelligence in a thriller written by Lindelof and Tara Hernandez ("The Big Bang Theory"). The nun is Simone; the A.I. is Mrs. Davis. (Peacock, April 20)
'Tom Jones'
Gwyneth Hughes, who has already adapted "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" and "Vanity Fair" for TV, takes on Henry Fielding's galloping, randy satire of 18th-century English values. A pair of newcomers star in the four-part series: Solly McLeod as the foundling Tom, and Sophie Wilde as his true love, Sophia, who's now an Anglo-Caribbean immigrant. (PBS, April 30)

Full text: Enlarge this image.
A VHS tape of “Peter and the Wolf,” the Disney animated short from 1946, played on repeat at home when Diego Calva was growing up in the 1990s.
Both terrified and tantalized by that first cinematic obsession as a child, Calva discovered the power of audiovisual storytelling in the unnerving leitmotif of the villainous wolf.
“Without being able to put in words, it made me realize that I was a little box of feelings and that movies could make them surface,” Calva explained, speaking in Spanish. “That hooked me.”
After only one major independent movie, the actor from Mexico City is now starring alongside Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie in his first megabudget American production: director Damien Chazelle’s silent-era revel “Babylon,” about the grotesque origins of the Hollywood film industry and why movies fascinate us.
Calva, 30, received a Golden Globe nomination for best actor in a musical or comedy for his performance as the Mexican-born Manny Torres, who slowly moves up the ranks in 1920s Hollywood — from catchall production assistant to influential producer.
His character functions as the story’s driving force: as both the link between Pitt’s and Robbie’s characters — two successful, often deranged actors — and as the viewer’s guide to this decadent world. Calva gives Manny an adoring naïveté about the movies, which fuels the character’s determination to become a part of them, even if his devotion eventually backfires.
While Calva worked hard to win the part, performing wasn’t his original dream. Long before Hollywood called, Calva had ambitions to become a writer-director, as he explained in an interview at a hotel in Beverly Hills. The tall, easygoing novice wore a preppy look composed of a gray sweater vest over a white T-shirt, black slacks and a pair of shiny black shoes.
From a young age, he surrounded himself with friends a few years older who were making short films. Like Manny, Calva helped out in miscellaneous positions behind the scenes of those independent shoots, whether it was catering or holding a boom mic.
On one such set, he was asked to step in for an actor who hadn’t shown up, which led to more jobs, mostly unpaid, in front of the camera. He eventually landed his first lead in a feature film, appearing in director Julio Hernández Cordón’s 2015 gay drama “I Promise You Anarchy,” a festival hit.
The story follows two male skateboarders in a tumultuous romance, as they become involved with criminals trafficking human blood on the black market.
On a friend’s recommendation, Hernández Cordón checked out Calva’s Facebook profile. Afterward, the director eagerly reached out to Calva, who had been skating since early adolescence.
“Within five minutes of meeting Diego, I knew he was the right person for the part because of his confidence and charisma,” Hernández Cordón said on a video call from Mexico City.
While there was no formal casting process, Calva and his co-star, Eduardo Eliseo Martinez, had to agree to the intimate scenes in the screenplay. Their openness to portraying intense desire solidified the director’s trust in them.
“I’ve always considered myself a bit punk and I love skating,” Calva said, “so the movie was like bringing to life some situations I was already going through at the time.”
As Hernández Cordón pointed out, Calva straddles the line between his middle-class upbringing, raised by a single mother who instilled in him an affinity for the arts, and the street smarts attained by wandering a large metropolis with kids from other socioeconomic backgrounds.
“I knew Diego had an innate talent, but I worried that he wouldn’t realize the gift he has,” Hernández Cordón said. “I’m very happy that he’s starting a new chapter with ‘Babylon.’”
That introduction to performing professionally, however, didn’t dazzle Calva enough to make him push his filmmaking aspirations aside.
He went on to enroll at the Centro de Capacitación Cinematográfica, one of Mexico’s preeminent film schools, to study directing. But to stay afloat financially, Calva took on acting work, which created a conflict with the institution’s policies.
Ultimately, he chose to leave the school and returned to acting full time, appearing on TV series and in supporting parts on the big screen, and putting on acting workshops for children.
It was during this period of doubt about his future that the opportunity to audition for the third season of the Netflix hit series “Narcos: Mexico” arrived. He aced it. And while playing real-life drug lord Arturo Beltrán Leyva on the show introduced him to production on a larger scale, Calva couldn’t anticipate what would soon come his way.
As Damien Chazelle searched, in late 2019, for a fresh face to star in “Babylon,” he came across Calva’s image amid a stack of headshots. The Oscar-winning director was struck by the actor’s gaze.
“There was something of a dreamer in his eyes, something of a poet,” Chazelle said via video. “But I had no idea if he could act.”
The character he envisioned Calva for, Manny, is partly inspired by two Latin American filmmakers whose careers started to take off in the 1920s: Enrique Juan Vallejo, a Mexican cinematographer and director, and René Cardona, a prolific Cuban-born director.
Calva submitted several self-taped auditions and eventually met with Chazelle online during the early months of the COVID pandemic. The more intrigued Chazelle became by Calva, the more it also became apparent that the actor had limited experience and that his English needed work.
Chazelle and Olivia Hamilton, his wife and a producer of the film, “debated whether it was a gamble worth taking with Diego,” Chazelle said. “She had this full 100% unwavering belief in him.”
Several months into the casting process, Calva began to feel overwhelmed by the life-changing magnitude of the opportunity, which seemed closer to materializing but not yet certain. Aside from executing Chazelle’s increasingly specific notes about his line delivery, improving his English became a priority.
In late 2020, Calva finally traveled to Los Angeles to meet with Chazelle and Robbie, who would play Nellie LaRoy, a fictional starlet and Manny’s love interest.
Using his cellphone, Chazelle filmed the chemistry read between Calva and Robbie in his backyard. Their palpable energy convinced him that Calva could deliver on his potential.
“He had this kind of Al Pacino-level ability to command the camera without seeming to do anything,” Chazelle said. In fact, Pacino’s arc from innocence to corruption as Michael Corleone in “The Godfather” films served as a key reference for Calva’s turn.
Robbie admired Calva’s ability to improvise in his second language.
“It’s so transformative to act with him because he’s so present that you forget you’re doing a scene,” Robbie said. “He was the greatest scene partner I could ever wish for.”
For Calva, the parallels between him and Manny feel almost like docu-fiction. “I identify with him in wanting to belong in the world of the movies,” he said. The actor’s wide-eyed reactions to an epic set piece early in the sweeping story came from genuine emotion.
“My first day on a Hollywood set was also the character’s first day on a Hollywood set,” Calva explained. “All of the expressions of surprise you see on my face are real.”
By the time one of the final scenes was shot, in which Manny watches the musical “Singin’ in the Rain” and cries, Calva had been immersed in the universe of Chazelle’s movie for nearly eight months. For that emotional moment, the director asked him to replay “Babylon” in its entirety, from Manny’s point of view, via facial expressions.
“It’s such a crazy piece of direction, and he does it,” Robbie said. “You feel everything you’ve felt for the last three hours play out on his face in a few seconds.”
“I needed an actor who could really dig deep and summon something,” Chazelle said. “It’s the hardest kind of acting to do because you don’t have the benefit of words, language or even body movement. You have to do it all just in your face, in your eyes.”
As Manny rises in Hollywood, he loses perspective, even denying his Mexican identity and claiming to be from Spain. Calva, grounded in advice from his mother, whom he considers his best friend, said he believed that wouldn’t happen to him.
“I don’t want to lose my childlike outlook on life, my ability for wonder,” Calva said. “I want to remember the road back home and know that if I make mistakes I won’t lose myself.”
For now, Calva plans to remain in Mexico City and build his burgeoning career, but whenever he’s wanted on this side of the border, the actor will joyfully oblige.
“They invited me to this party,” Calva said with a hint of mischievous glee. “Getting me out of Hollywood is going to be difficult.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Rules, Sometimes, Are Meant to Be Observed: [Review]

Full text: The new bistro from Ignacio Mattos, who made his name with iconoclastic places like Estela, is safe, correct and satisfying.
Ignacio Mattos, the chef and restaurateur, gave New York one of its most original restaurants of the past decade, Estela. With his latest place, Corner Bar, he seems to be out to prove that originality is overrated. I'm not sure he succeeds, but he comes a lot closer than I would have thought possible.
Corner Bar is more than a bar, but the rest is straightforward enough. It is indeed on a corner, inside Nine Orchard, a new boutique hotel on Canal Street where the smallest rooms currently start at $ 525 a night. The building is in that ambiguous piece of downtown where Chinatown and the Lower East Side meet and seem to run out of steam.
A stalemate was in effect there for years until the restaurant Dimes arrived with the alluring idea that the secret to youth and beauty was as simple as putting sunchokes in your Caesar salad and wheatgrass in your margaritas. Soon a cluster of new bars and other demographically aligned businesses had made the micro-district, by then called Dimes Square, one of the last places in Lower Manhattan where artists, skater kids, part-time novelists, full-time conversationalists and philosophy students stuck in waitressing gigs could share the same length of sidewalk.
Dimes Square's fame probably helped put Corner Bar on the map when it opened in June. For all practical purposes, though, the culture of Dimes Square ends just outside Corner Bar.
Bar hoppers who stroll in and out of Clandestino in packs may be brought up short by the phalanx of fancily dressed hosts and greeters at the door. Fans of Dimes's broccoli melt may blink hard at Corner Bar's canard à l'orange and terrine of foie gras with riesling gelée. Members of the natural-wine generation who pile into Le Dive and Parcelle for pét-nats and sans soufre chenin blanc may be at a loss faced with the outright classicism of Corner Bar's wine list, which kicks off with three pages of Champagne before lavishing attention on the Côte de Beaune and Côte de Nuits.
Corner Bar is nobody's idea of a cutting-edge restaurant. The menu is short, safe and self-explanatory, from the shrimp cocktail to the profiteroles. The least adventurous eater you know could find something to order in under two minutes, although it may take slightly longer to decipher the specials, written on a chalkboard above the long marble bar in lettering usually seen on an eye chart's bottom row.
An expensive restaurant in a luxury hotel serving highly familiar American, French and Italian food sounds like the most predictable thing imaginable. As a rule, unimaginative menus lead to sleepwalking cooks. (Or maybe it's the other way around.) Surprisingly, somewhat puzzlingly, this rule doesn't apply at Corner Bar. Under Vincent D'Ambrosio, the chef de cuisine, the kitchen is making these routine classics as if the fate of the world depended on it. This is cooking of a very high order.
The fresh tagliatelle -- silky from egg yolks, firm without being stiff -- suggest that somewhere in that kitchen is an unsmiling nonna who handles a rolling pin as authoritatively as Danai Gurira wields a vibranium spear. Some nights, the noodles glisten with a sauce that shows why a three-meat Bolognese (beef, lamb and pork, in this case) is always best. Other nights, they are tossed with soft and juicy pieces of lobster and a sticky, intense lobster stock.
The steak au poivre is not quite by the book; if there is any cream in the sauce, I couldn't find it. But enough butter seems to have been folded in to make up for it. The meat, under a knobby armor of peppercorns and flaky salt, is a strikingly juicy and satisfying Wagyu skirt steak.
This is the logical place to mention the pommes frites. They are thick and substantial, and have the kind of crunch that isn't achieved without time and effort. I'm sure no kitchen wants to be judged by its fried potatoes alone, but you know you're in a place that takes cooking seriously when you taste fries like these.
Corner Bar doesn't mess around in the shellfish department, either. Six long blue prawns make up the shrimp cocktail, and they are cooked exactly right (as they should be when a shrimp cocktail costs $ 35). Steamed in their shells, head and all, those prawns are also a highlight of the $ 85 plateau de fruits de mer, accompanied, when I had it, with shucked oysters, creamy marinated mussels, tiles of raw bluefin and sea trout, and half a small steamed lobster.
Disappointments are few and relatively minor -- a foie gras terrine cooked to a dull gray, an omelet under shaved white truffles was a little too firm. But in the company of other, virtually flawless dishes, and at these prices ( $ 34 for the terrine, $ 125 for the omelet), they stand out.
There's nothing wrong with making superior iterations of classics that have grown tired from overexposure. Alain Ducasse, in his bistro and brasserie makeovers, has devoted the recent part of his career to it. But it helps to bring some twists and turns to the canon. A predictable menu combined with high prices has a way of squeezing the fun out of a room.
Of course, the mood at Corner Bar lightens with dessert. The classic, shallow crême brûlée is soft and shot through with vanilla seeds. A pitcher of dark-chocolate sauce is almost emptied over the profiteroles, then set on the table for further use.
Somehow, though, the dessert I keep thinking about is the Matterhorn of soft-serve pineapple sorbet with emerald streams of basil oil running down its slopes. It may or may not be a tribute to the Dole Whip from Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room. I hope it is. Corner Bar is a serious restaurant, but it could use a few surprises.

DeSantis Takes Oath as Speculation Looms: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, who is weighing a possible run for president, set his state up as a blueprint for conservative policy across the country.
Gov. Ron DeSantis opened his second four-year term on Tuesday with a speech that heralded Florida as a conservative blueprint for the rest of the country and subtly signaled his long-rumored ambitions for the White House.
Speaking from the steps of the Florida Capitol in Tallahassee minutes after being sworn in, Mr. DeSantis, a Republican, made no direct mention of a potential presidential campaign in 2024. His 16-minute address during his second inauguration was peppered instead with suggestive lines that hinted at contrasts with former President Donald J. Trump, a fellow Floridian who is the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.
Mr. DeSantis, 44, criticized a "floundering federal establishment" for a "spending binge" that "left our nation weaker," without differentiating between increases under the Trump or Biden administrations. Similarly, he assailed the federal government for "pandemic restrictions and mandates" that "eroded freedom and stunted commerce." Many restrictions were put in place when Covid-19 first spread during Mr. Trump's time in office.
Mr. DeSantis has publicly questioned the science that federal health officials used to encourage vaccinations. And he has battled with Florida school districts, including in Republican counties, that defied his executive order to ban mask mandates in classrooms.
"We lead not by mere words, but by deeds," Mr. DeSantis said, calling the Republican-led state "the land of liberty and the land of sanity."
As he ticked through a list of benchmarks during his first term, Mr. DeSantis repeated the same phrase -- "We delivered" -- seven times during the first five minutes of his speech. He sought to claim credit for the state's economic success and population gains, and draw attention to his 19-point margin of victory in November over former Representative Charlie Crist, a Democrat.
Mr. DeSantis has not said whether he will run for president. At a debate during his re-election campaign, he refused to commit to serving a full four-year term.
On Tuesday, he promised a second-term agenda that would deliver "record tax relief" for Florida families and further lean into the cultural battles that have brought him national attention, Republican support and Democratic criticism.
As governor, Mr. DeSantis led the charge to prohibit discussions of sexual orientation and gender identity in early elementary school and limit what schools and employers can teach about racism. He stripped Disney, long an untouchable corporate giant in the state, of the ability to govern itself for the first time in more than half a century -- retaliation for the company's opposition to the crackdown on L.G.B.T.Q. conversations with young schoolchildren.
Mr. DeSantis offered no new specific policies in his speech, vowing only to "enact more family-friendly policies" and to lead the fight for "freedom."
In the audience was Jeb Bush, the former governor who came up short in his presidential bid in 2016. Mr. Bush ushered in a modern Republican era in Florida in 1998 with his first election as governor. Since then, Democrats have never recaptured the governor's mansion in Tallahassee.
On a breezy, 72-degree day, Mr. DeSantis was sworn in at about 11:15 a.m., joined by his wife, Casey, 42, and their three children: Madison, 6; Mason, 4; and Mamie, 2. Mason buried his head in his mother's light green dress as she held a Bible for her husband.
The Bible Mr. DeSantis used to take the oath of office was a Bible of the Revolution, the first complete Bible in English to be printed in America, according to Sotheby's. Glenn Beck, the conservative commentator, posted on Twitter that he lent that Bible to Mr. DeSantis for the inauguration.

NEW YORK — Ignacio Mattos, the chef and restaurateur, gave New York one of its most original restaurants of the past decade, Estela. With his latest place, Corner Bar, he seems to be out to prove that originality is overrated. I’m not sure he succeeds, but he comes a lot closer than I would have thought possible.
Corner Bar is more than a bar, but the rest is straightforward enough. It is indeed on a corner, inside Nine Orchard, a new boutique hotel on Canal Street where the smallest rooms start at $525 a night. The building is in that ambiguous piece of downtown where Chinatown and the Lower East Side meet and seem to run out of steam.
A stalemate was in effect there for years until the restaurant Dimes arrived with the alluring idea that the secret to youth and beauty was as simple as putting sunchokes in your Caesar salad and wheatgrass in your margaritas. Soon a cluster of new bars and other demographically aligned businesses had made the micro-district, by then called Dimes Square, one of the last places in lower Manhattan where artists, skater kids, part-time novelists, full-time conversationalists and philosophy students stuck in waitressing gigs could share the same length of sidewalk.
Dimes Square’s fame probably helped put Corner Bar on the map when it opened in June. For all practical purposes, though, the culture of Dimes Square ends just outside Corner Bar.
Bar hoppers who stroll in and out of Clandestino in packs may be brought up short by the phalanx of fancily dressed hosts and greeters at the door. Fans of Dimes’ broccoli melt may blink hard at Corner Bar’s canard à l’orange and terrine of foie gras with riesling gelée. Members of the natural-wine generation who pile into Le Dive and Parcelle for pét-nats and sans soufre chenin blanc may be at a loss faced with the outright classicism of Corner Bar’s wine list, which kicks off with three pages of Champagne before lavishing attention on the Côte de Beaune and Côte de Nuits.
Corner Bar is nobody’s idea of a cutting-edge restaurant. The menu is short, safe and self-explanatory, from the shrimp cocktail to the profiteroles. The least adventurous eater you know could find something to order in under two minutes, although it may take slightly longer to decipher the specials, written on a chalkboard above the long marble bar in lettering usually seen on an eye chart’s bottom row.
An expensive restaurant in a luxury hotel serving highly familiar American, French and Italian food sounds like the most predictable thing imaginable. As a rule, unimaginative menus lead to sleepwalking cooks. (Or maybe it’s the other way around.) Surprisingly, somewhat puzzlingly, this rule doesn’t apply at Corner Bar. Under Vincent D’Ambrosio, the chef de cuisine, the kitchen is making these routine classics as if the fate of the world depended on it. This is cooking of a very high order.
The fresh tagliatelle — silky from egg yolks, firm without being stiff — suggest that somewhere in that kitchen is an unsmiling nonna who handles a rolling pin as authoritatively as Danai Gurira wields a vibranium spear. Some nights, the noodles glisten with a sauce that shows why a three-meat Bolognese (beef, lamb and pork, in this case) is always best. Other nights, they are tossed with soft and juicy pieces of lobster and a sticky, intense lobster stock.
The steak au poivre is not quite by the book; if there is any cream in the sauce, I couldn’t find it. But enough butter seems to have been folded in to make up for it. The meat, under a knobby armor of peppercorns and flaky salt, is a strikingly juicy and satisfying Wagyu skirt steak.
This is the logical place to mention the pommes frites. They are thick and substantial, and have the kind of crunch that isn’t achieved without time and effort. I’m sure no kitchen wants to be judged by its fried potatoes alone, but you know you’re in a place that takes cooking seriously when you taste fries like these.
Corner Bar doesn’t mess around in the shellfish department, either. Six long blue prawns make up the shrimp cocktail, and they are cooked exactly right (as they should be when a shrimp cocktail costs $35). Steamed in their shells, head and all, those prawns are also a highlight of the $85 plateau de fruits de mer, accompanied, when I had it, with shucked oysters, creamy marinated mussels, tiles of raw bluefin and sea trout, and half a small steamed lobster.
Disappointments are few and relatively minor — a foie gras terrine cooked to a dull gray, an omelet under shaved white truffles was a little too firm. But in the company of other, virtually flawless dishes, and at these prices ($34 for the terrine, $125 for the omelet), they stand out.
There’s nothing wrong with making superior iterations of classics that have grown tired from overexposure. Alain Ducasse, in his bistro and brasserie makeovers, has devoted the recent part of his career to it. But it helps to bring some twists and turns to the canon. A predictable menu combined with high prices has a way of squeezing the fun out of a room.
Of course, the mood at Corner Bar lightens with dessert. The classic, shallow crème brûlée is soft and shot through with vanilla seeds. A pitcher of dark-chocolate sauce is almost emptied over the profiteroles, then set on the table for further use.
Somehow, though, the dessert I keep thinking about is the Matterhorn of soft-serve pineapple sorbet with emerald streams of basil oil running down its slopes. It may or may not be a tribute to the Dole Whip from Walt Disney’s Enchanted Tiki Room. I hope it is. Corner Bar is a serious restaurant, but it could use a few surprises.

Full text: The actor, known for his role as Hawkeye in Marvel's Avengers movies, had surgery, his representative said.
The actor Jeremy Renner was in critical but stable condition after being hospitalized with serious injuries from an accident while plowing snow in Nevada, his representative said in a statement.
Mr. Renner had surgery on Monday and had "suffered blunt chest trauma and orthopedic injuries" from the accident, the representative, Samantha Mast, said in a statement, adding that Mr. Renner remained in the intensive care unit.
The sheriff's office in Washoe County, Nev., said Mr. Renner had suffered a "traumatic injury" in Reno on Sunday morning. He was the only person involved in the accident and was flown to a nearby hospital, the sheriff's office said. Mr. Renner has a house in the Mount Rose-Ski Tahoe area, according to The Reno-Gazette Journal.
Mr. Renner, 51, has played Hawkeye, a member of Marvel's Avengers superheroes team, in several movies and a television series. He has also twice been nominated for an Oscar, for his roles in "The Hurt Locker" (2008) and "The Town" (2010).
Ms. Mast said Mr. Renner and his family were "tremendously overwhelmed and appreciative of the outpouring of love and support from his fans."
Mr. Renner has shared several updates on social media this winter as the Reno area received large amounts of snow.
"Nearly done With sledding hill For the kids," said a caption on an Instagram video clip showing a snow plow last week.
"Lake Tahoe snowfall is no joke," he said last month in a tweet that showed a vehicle covered in snow.
Mr. Renner stars in "Mayor of Kingstown," a thriller whose second season is set to be released on the Paramount+ streaming service on Jan. 15. Another show, "Rennervations," which follows Mr. Renner as he helps communities to reimagine purpose-built vehicles, is scheduled to air on Disney+ early this year.
The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning over the weekend for the areas around Reno, in addition to a warning that was in place for the Lake Tahoe Basin. On Saturday and Sunday, the Tahoe Basin at lake level received between 20 and 24 inches of snow, the Weather Service in Reno said.
The Weather Service on Sunday advised those with travel plans through the Sierra Nevada to prepare for winter weather driving conditions and warned of icy roads as additional storms arrive. About 22,000 customers in Nevada were without power early Monday after the storm, according to PowerOutage.us, which aggregates data from utilities across the country.

Hispanic Evangelicals, Now a G.O.P. Bloc, Ask: Trump or DeSantis?: [National Desk]

Full text: In Florida, where Hispanic evangelicals carry outsize influence, many of their pastors view the budding 2024 rivalry as a sign of the potency of their unabashedly politicized Christianity.
MIAMI -- Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida hasn't announced he's running for president yet. But among the right-leaning voting blocs that are pulling for him to enter the 2024 primary field are some of his biggest fans: Hispanic evangelical Christians.
It's not that they're opposed to the one Republican who has already declared himself a candidate, former President Donald J. Trump. But a showdown between the two titans of the right wing could turn Latino evangelicals into a decisive swing vote in Florida -- supercharging their influence and focusing enormous national attention on their churches, their politics and their values.
"If there is a primary, there's no doubt there will be fragmentation in the conservative movement, and there's total certainty that will be true of Hispanic evangelicals as well," said the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, a pastor in Sacramento, Calif., and the president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference. "We know the values we keep and the policies we want. The question that arises is, who will really reflect those?"
Mr. Rodriguez's group held a gathering last month in Tampa, Fla., with hundreds of pastors from across the country, where attendees said the hallways buzzed between sessions with more chatter about politics than about Scripture.
Much of it, they said, came down to a choice: Trump or DeSantis?
Few have settled on an answer yet, not surprisingly given that the first votes of the 2024 campaign are over a year away. But the talk of 2024 -- of Mr. Trump, who spent years courting evangelicals, and of Mr. DeSantis, who has leaned into the cultural battles that appeal to many conservative Christians -- showed both the heightened expectations among Hispanic evangelical leaders in Florida and their desire to demonstrate the potency of their now unabashedly politicized Christianity.
"It is about morals, and there is one party right now that reflects our morals," said Dionny Báez, a Miami pastor who leads a network of churches. "We cannot be afraid to remind people that we have values that the Republicans are willing to fight for. I have a responsibility to make clear what we believe. We can no longer make that taboo."
Hispanic evangelicals have long had outsize influence in Florida, where Latinos make up roughly 27 percent of the population and 21 percent of eligible voters. Though they are outnumbered among Hispanics by Roman Catholics, evangelicals are far more likely to vote for Republicans. Overall, Hispanic voters in the state favored Republicans for the first time in decades in the midterm elections in November.
Mr. DeSantis has courted Hispanic evangelicals assiduously as his national profile has risen.
When he signed a law last year banning abortions after 15 weeks, he did so at Nación de Fe, a Hispanic evangelical megachurch in Osceola County. He declared Nov. 7, the day before the midterm election, as "Victims of Communism Day," appealing not just to Cubans in the state, but also immigrants from Venezuela and Nicaragua, who have helped swell the pews of evangelical churches in Florida. His campaign aides frequently spoke with Hispanic pastors, cultivating support that many expect Mr. DeSantis to try to capitalize on in a presidential campaign.
Of course, Mr. Trump, too, can call upon loyalists: Mr. Rodriguez spoke at his inauguration in 2017, and other Hispanic evangelical leaders endorsed him.
But Mr. DeSantis could complicate the equation in a potential 2024 Republican primary because of Hispanic evangelicals' concentration and considerable sway in Florida. Many view Mr. DeSantis as a hero of the pandemic, praising him for not requiring churches to shut down or instituting vaccine mandates.
A battle for Hispanic evangelicals' loyalties would only further cement their importance in Florida and beyond, as they grow more organized and seek to wield power more effectively.
In Miami and elsewhere, Hispanic evangelical churches range from tiny storefronts to megachurches with six-piece bands and full-service cafes. Second- and third-generation American citizens pray alongside recent immigrants from Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Cuba and the Dominican Republic. Services are often in Spanish, though many congregants are bilingual, eager for their children to speak both English and Spanish.
Many did not vote at all until the last decade and cast their first ballots for Mr. Trump in 2016 or 2020. His political style has served as a model for some Latino evangelical pastors who have stoked anger over coronavirus restrictions. Attendance at churches, pastors said, has increased during the pandemic.
At Segadores de Vida, an evangelical church in Southwest Ranches, west of Fort Lauderdale, where more than 6,000 worshipers attend Sunday services, the pastor, Rev. Ruddy Gracia, has taken to the pulpit to criticize pandemic restrictions that shut down churches in other states and to disparage Covid vaccines, urging congregants to rely instead on divine immunity.
In an interview, Mr. Gracia said that his preaching about politics had attracted more members, many of whom, he added, shared his doubts about the country's economic, political and spiritual direction.
"The principles of the liberal people in the United States are evil according to the Bible standards, not my standards -- the Bible -- and that wasn't like that before," Mr. Gracia said. "We are ultraconservative. So every time we go into the pulpit or speak, you know, we are actually speaking about politics."
Mr. Gracia, who emigrated from the Dominican Republic as a young man and is now 57, described himself as "old-fashioned" in his ideas about leadership, spending time reading about emperors and famous generals. That informed his views of Mr. DeSantis and Mr. Trump, he said.
"I have always been a great admirer of guts and being aggressive, and they both have this behavior of a true leader," he said, musing aloud whether the two Republican rivals could run on a joint ticket. "I see in both of these men a drive and a strain that is extremely needed in the kind of world we live in today."
Daniel Garza, the executive director of Libre, a conservative group focused on Hispanic outreach, said he had worshiped at evangelical churches across the country and noticed that pastors were speaking more directly about politics from the pulpit. "We've always had a familiarity, but what we see now is a kind of coziness we've not had in the past," he said.
Evangelicals remain a minority among Latino voters, but polls show they are far more likely to vote for Republicans than those who are Catholic or religiously unaffiliated, though they are not a monolithic voting bloc.
They are often more open to relaxing some immigration rules than Republican leaders, and even some of those who supported Mr. Trump were turned off by his anti-immigrant messages.
When Mr. Trump kicked off his outreach to evangelicals in his 2020 re-election campaign, he did so at King Jesus International Ministry, a huge Hispanic congregation in Miami. The church's pastor, Guillermo Maldonado, assured his members, who include a large number of undocumented immigrants from Central America and the Caribbean, that they did not have to be U.S. citizens to attend the rally.
Some Hispanic evangelical leaders shudder at the idea that the group represents a unified voting bloc that will automatically favor Republicans. Hispanic evangelicals are more likely to choose Democrats than white evangelicals, they note. Still, even those leaders are enthusiastic about describing the group as a quintessential swing vote that is not fully committed to either party.
"To be evangelical is not a political denomination," said Gabriel Salguero, a pastor in Orlando who runs the National Latino Evangelical Coalition and keeps his political preferences private as a matter of principle. "It is about our faith in Christ, and commitment to the Gospel. So we don't put our trust in politics, but we should be involved."
Across the country, many Hispanic evangelical leaders have embraced talking more explicitly about politics in their sermons.
Mr. Báez, the pastor of a network of churches, avoided any mention of politics for years when his pulpit was in Philadelphia. He thought of his role at the time, he said, as being above politics. He rarely even voted.
But since moving to Florida in 2019 and starting a new congregation that meets in a former nightclub in downtown Miami, he rarely hesitates to speak about political issues.
Mr. Báez has told congregants about his decision to stop allowing his young children to watch Disney movies. He said the company had gone too far in its support for transgender rights, and he applauded the law passed last year by Mr. DeSantis and state Republicans that restricts classroom instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity.
Mr. Báez has also been outspoken in opposing schools that educate children about gender identity.
"No teacher should be talking to young children about sexuality -- let me as a parent do that," he said, adding that he first became aware of the issue during the so-called bathroom bill debates years ago. "We have moved into the extreme views on this. We have to respect parents, not impose one view."
Each Sunday, Mr. Báez hosts a boisterous service at H2O Miami, as the church is known, with hundreds gathering around tables to sing along with a Christian rock band, lifting their hands in praise. When the two-hour services end, congregants hug one another and assemble at the edge of the stage to ask Mr. Báez and his wife to lay their hands on them in prayer.
Like other Hispanic evangelical leaders, Mr. Báez has developed a large and loyal following both in the United States and in Latin America, with nearly a million followers on social media. He appears frequently on Spanish-language television, typically focusing on upbeat messages of hope rather than explicit mentions of Jesus or conservative values.
"There is a reason most Latinos are liberal -- it's what they watch on TV," he said over breakfast in his backyard in Miramar, a suburb about half an hour north of Miami. "We want to give an alternative vision to that."

Hispanic evangelicals are more likely to choose Democrats than white evangelicals, they note. Still, even those leaders are enthusiastic about describing the group as a quintessential swing vote that is not fully committed to either party.
“To be evangelical is not a political denomination,” said Gabriel Salguero, a pastor in Orlando who runs the National Latino Evangelical Coalition and keeps his political preferences private as a matter of principle. “It is about our faith in Christ, and commitment to the Gospel. So we don’t put our trust in politics, but we should be involved.”
Across the country, many Hispanic evangelical leaders have embraced talking more explicitly about politics in their sermons.
Báez avoided any mention of politics for years when his pulpit was in Philadelphia. He thought of his role at the time, he said, as being above politics. He rarely even voted.
But since moving to Florida in 2019 and starting a new congregation that meets in a former nightclub in downtown Miami, he rarely hesitates to speak about political issues.
Báez has told congregants about his decision to stop allowing his young children to watch Disney movies. He said the company had gone too far in its support for transgender rights, and he applauded the law passed last year by DeSantis and state Republicans that restricts classroom instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity.
Báez has also been outspoken in opposing schools that educate children about gender identity.
“No teacher should be talking to young children about sexuality — let me as a parent do that,” he said, adding that he first became aware of the issue during the so-called bathroom bill debates years ago. “We have moved into the extreme views on this. We have to respect parents, not impose one view.”
Each Sunday, Báez hosts a boisterous service at H2O Miami, as the church is known, with hundreds gathering around tables to sing along with a Christian rock band, lifting their hands in praise. When the two-hour services end, congregants hug one another and assemble at the edge of the stage to ask Báez and his wife to lay their hands on them in prayer.
Like other Hispanic evangelical leaders, Báez has developed a large and loyal following both in the United States and in Latin America, with nearly 1 million followers on social media. He appears frequently on Spanish-language television, typically focusing on upbeat messages of hope rather than explicit mentions of Jesus or conservative values.
“There is a reason most Latinos are liberal — it’s what they watch on TV,” he said over breakfast in his backyard in Miramar, a suburb about a half-hour north of Miami. “We want to give an alternative vision to that.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Actor Jeremy Renner was in critical but stable condition after being hospitalized with serious injuries from an accident while plowing snow in Nevada, his representative said in a statement.
Renner had surgery Monday and had “suffered blunt chest trauma and orthopedic injuries” from the accident, the representative, Samantha Mast, said in a statement, adding that Renner remained in the intensive care unit.
The sheriff’s office in Washoe County, Nevada, said Renner had suffered a “traumatic injury” in the Reno area Sunday morning. He was the only person involved in the accident and was flown to a nearby hospital, the sheriff’s office said. Renner has a house in the Mount Rose-Ski Tahoe area, according to The Reno-Gazette Journal.
Renner, 51, has played Hawkeye, a member of Marvel’s Avengers superheroes team, in several movies and a television series. He has also twice been nominated for an Oscar, for his roles in “The Hurt Locker” (2008) and “The Town” (2010).
Mast said Renner and his family were “tremendously overwhelmed and appreciative of the outpouring of love and support from his fans.”
Renner has shared several updates on social media this winter as the Reno area received large amounts of snow.
“Nearly done With sledding hill For the kids,” said a caption on an Instagram video clip showing a snow plow last week.
“Lake Tahoe snowfall is no joke,” he said in a tweet last month that showed a vehicle covered in snow.
Renner stars in “Mayor Kingstown,” a thriller whose second season is set to be released on the Paramount+ streaming service on Jan. 15. Another show, “Rennervations,” which follows Renner as he helps communities to re-imagine purpose-built vehicles, is scheduled to air on Disney+ early this year.
The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning over the weekend for the areas around Reno, in addition to a warning that was in place for the Lake Tahoe Basin. On Saturday and Sunday, the Tahoe Basin at lake level received between 20 and 24 inches of snow, the weather service in Reno said.
The weather service on Sunday advised those with travel plans through the Sierra Nevada to prepare for winter weather driving conditions and warned of icy roads as additional storms arrive. About 22,000 customers in Nevada were without power early Monday after the storm, according to poweroutage.us, which aggregates data from utilities across the country.

Full text: Each year, the comic headlined the club during the holidays. With the space closing, his final show there was a mix of deadpan and melancholy notes.
How do you honor the death of a comedy club? First, you kill.
Walking onstage late Friday night at the final headlining show at Carolines on Broadway, which after three decades is closing its doors, Dave Attell handled that job quickly, spraying punch lines, roasting the front row and making sure the raucous audience knew it was part of history. In one galloping tangent, Attell urged anyone not laughing to leave. "Take a table and chair with you, because we have to clear this place out," he said.
Attell has performed at Carolines between Christmas and New Year's for 13 years, a holiday tradition for audiences who wanted something significantly dirtier than the Rockettes. This time, he mixed in a few heartfelt, even melancholy notes into his virtuosic deadpan rhythms to eulogize the passing of a legendary comedy room. But comedians mourn differently. When a waiter walked past the stage toward the door, Attell, dressed in a characteristic black jacket and baseball cap, asked him where he was going, pausing before the joke: "Unemployment."
Like a drama queen writing her will, New York is perpetually and loudly dying. Hardly a day goes by without teeth gnashing over a beloved part of this city calling it quits. Every closed diner is the end of an epoch. The most mundane and predictable demise, the end of a Broadway run, receives extended soul-searching and public autopsy. To me, this seems (mostly) sensible. It's healthy to mark the end of things, and what is better than a great finale? But I've been covering show business in this dynamic city too long to get too sentimental. We shouldn't overly fetishize institutions. One of the legacies of "Stomp," which closes next month after a 29-year run, is all the shows that did not get produced in its theater. Change is good.
And yet, I couldn't help but feel a little melancholy walking down the steps into Caroline's for the last time, a steep descent that gave you a chance to adjust from the gaudy lights of Times Square. Caroline's isn't technically gone; after a final show on New Year's Eve, it is producing the New York Comedy Festival and other unnamed projects. Still, with the stage backdrop, stools and other parts of the club soon to be shipped to the National Comedy Center in Jamestown, N.Y., the loss of this room is significant.
When Caroline's opened in Chelsea in 1981 (it had two homes before moving to the theater district in the next decade), New York comedy clubs were essentially dive bars with stages, featuring packed bills of short sets by lowly paid or unpaid comics desperate for performing time to work out jokes. Caroline's introduced a new model: hour sets by more established talent, bigger pay days and a more upscale atmosphere. There was plush carpeting and a dressing room. Instead of a brick wall, the comics stood in front of a checkerboard pattern artfully missing a few pieces. In a 1985 story in The Times, Robert Morton, a producer on "Late Night With David Letterman," described Caroline's as "the first yuppie comedy club," becoming maybe the last person to use that word as a compliment.
Many were exposed to the club via the television show "Caroline's Comedy Hour," which ended in the mid-'90s. Its impressive lineups offer a history of modern stand-up. On one 1992 episode, Attell performed with Dave Chappelle, Louis C.K., Jon Stewart, Susie Essman and Colin Quinn.
That Caroline's was located in the heart of Broadway mattered, adding a touch of class to stand-up, an art form rooted in vaudeville and minstrel shows that was then rarely afforded the critical respect of theater and film. Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the club, played a key role in raising the stature of stand-up. You can even make the case that she helped set the stage for the transformation of Times Square, opening just a few years before Disney arrived in the neighborhood.
On Friday before the show, when I asked about her most memorable nights at the club, Hirsch recalled the time Robin Williams took over a Jeff Garlin set with some inspired heckling and a string of performances by Kevin Hart. She also told a story about how Don King walked into the club when John Witherspoon was telling a joke about him. Her recollections underlined the real importance of Caroline's: the staggering number of memorable experiences had there. I had more than my share.
Caroline's was the only place where I saw veteran stars like Dick Gregory, Richard Lewis and Damon Wayans. Before he was on "Saturday Night Live," I caught Michael Che there. And years before he had a special, I knew that Ricky Velez would get one after watching him do an electric opening set. The most memorable part of a Tiffany Haddish show was when she spotted Whoopi Goldberg in the audience and tearfully described how important it was as a child to see the veteran star on television.
Caroline's was not dogmatic about the kinds of comics it booked. It didn't have a house style, which might have hurt its brand but made it unpredictable, featuring talent from an array of ages, backgrounds and styles. Bo Burnham cut an album there early in his career, and Phoebe Robinson got her start by taking a comedy class at Caroline's.
One of the all-time funniest shows I ever saw was Rory Scovel doing an hour at Caroline's. A decade before John Mulaney toured arenas with bits about fame and addiction, he performed a hilarious hour at Caroline's in which he told jokes about his marriage and his alcoholism.
Caroline's was also not above oddball bookings (Larry "Bud" Melman performed there). I once saw a 13-year old do a standup act and also made the error of taking my 7-year-old daughter to a Ron Funches show, only to rush out when the jokes became too dirty.
Toward the end of the night, Attell asked his opening acts, Ian Fidance, Jordan Jensen and Wil Sylvince to join him onstage. They riffed with one another, before Attell turned to the crowd and asked with an odd formality: "May I?" Then he took out a blue recorder, which he described as "somewhere between a flute and a bong."
In between raunchy jokes, he played simple, wistful songs. He remarked on the sadness of the instrument's sound. Then he opened his jacket and brought out a second recorder, a yellow one. Seeing this gruff, grizzled legend wield two colorful pipes was its own sight gag. It was also a reminder that while Attell's much imitated delivery has its own musicality, when it comes to expressing certain kinds of emotion, no joke can really match a few notes played with conviction.
Then he beckoned Caroline Hirsch to the stage, called her "a force" and thanked her for "making us all better." Describing the moment as "bittersweet," she said she would be producing more shows in the future. Then everyone took selfies onstage to commemorate the moment and awkwardly shuffled off the stage.

Brazil Installs Lula as Leader; Loser Is Absent: [Correction]

Full text: Brazil inaugurates its new president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, on Sunday. Facing investigations, former President Jair Bolsonaro has taken refuge in Orlando.
President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took the reins of the Brazilian government on Sunday in an elaborate inauguration, complete with a motorcade, music festival and hundreds of thousands of supporters filling the central esplanade of Brasília, the nation's capital.
But one key person was missing: the departing far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro.
Mr. Bolsonaro was supposed to pass Mr. Lula the presidential sash on Sunday, an important symbol of the peaceful transition of power in a nation where many people still recall the 21-year military dictatorship that ended in 1985.
Instead, Mr. Bolsonaro woke up Sunday thousands of miles away, in a rented house owned by a professional mixed-martial-arts fighter a few miles from Disney World. Facing various investigations from his time in his office, Mr. Bolsonaro flew to Orlando on Friday night and plans to stay in Florida for at least a month.
Mr. Bolsonaro had questioned the reliability of Brazil's election systems for months, without evidence, and when he lost in October, he refused to concede unequivocally. In a sort of farewell address on Friday, breaking weeks of near silence, he said that he tried to block Mr. Lula from taking office but failed.
"Within the laws, respecting the Constitution, I searched for a way out of this," he said. He then appeared to encourage his supporters to move on. "We live in a democracy or we don't," he said. "No one wants an adventure."
On Sunday, Mr. Lula ascended the ramp to the presidential offices with a diverse group of Brazilians, including a Black woman, a disabled man, a 10-year-old boy, an Indigenous man and a factory worker. A voice then announced that Mr. Lula would accept the green-and-yellow sash from "the Brazilian people," and Aline Sousa, a 33-year-old garbage collector, played the role of Mr. Bolsonaro and placed the sash on the new president.
In an address to Congress on Sunday, Mr. Lula said that he would fight hunger and deforestation, lift the economy and try to unite the country. But he also took aim at his predecessor, saying that Mr. Bolsonaro had threatened Brazil's democracy.
"Under the winds of redemocratization, we used to say, 'Dictatorship never again,"' he said. "Today, after the terrible challenge we've overcome, we must say, 'Democracy forever."'
Mr. Lula's ascension to the presidency caps a stunning political comeback. He was once Brazil's most popular president, leaving office with an approval rating above 80 percent. He then served 580 days in prison, from 2018 to 2019, on corruption charges that he accepted a condo and renovations from construction companies bidding on government contracts.
After those convictions were thrown out because Brazil's Supreme Court ruled that the judge in Mr. Lula's case was biased, he ran for the presidency again -- and won.
Mr. Lula, 77, and his supporters maintain that he was the victim of political persecution. Mr. Bolsonaro and his supporters say that Brazil now has a criminal as president.
In Brasília, hundreds of thousands of people streamed into the sprawling, planned capital, founded in 1960 to house the Brazilian government, with many dressed in the bright red of Mr. Lula's leftist Workers' Party.
Over the weekend, passengers on arriving planes broke into rally songs about Mr. Lula, revelers danced to samba at New Year's Eve parties and, across the city, spontaneous cries rang out from balconies and street corners, heralding Mr. Lula's arrival and Mr. Bolsonaro's exit.
"Lula's inauguration is mainly about hope," said Isabela Nascimento, 30, a software developer walking to the festivities on Sunday. "I hope to see him representing not only a political party, but an entire population -- a whole group of people who just want to be happier."
Yet elsewhere in the city, thousands of Mr. Bolsonaro's supporters remained camped outside the army headquarters, as they have been since the election, many saying they were convinced that at the final moment on Sunday, the military would prevent Mr. Lula from taking office.
"The army has patriotism and love for the country, and in the past, the army did the same thing," Magno Rodrigues, 60, a former mechanic and janitor who gives daily speeches at the protests, said on Saturday, referring to the 1964 military coup that ushered in the dictatorship.
Mr. Rodrigues has spent the past nine weeks sleeping in a tent on a narrow pad with his wife. He provided a tour of the encampment, which had become a small village since Mr. Bolsonaro lost the election. It has showers, a laundry service, cellphone-charging stations, a hospital and 28 food stalls.
The protests have been overwhelmingly nonviolent -- with more praying than rioting -- but a small group of people have set fire to vehicles. Mr. Lula's transitional government had suggested that the encampments would not be tolerated for much longer.
How long was Mr. Rodrigues prepared to stay? "As long as it takes to liberate my country," he said. "For the rest of my life if I have to."
The absence of Mr. Bolsonaro and the presence of thousands of protesters who believe the election was stolen illustrate the deep divide and tall challenges that Mr. Lula faces in his third term as president of Latin America's biggest country and one of the world's largest democracies.
He oversaw a boom in Brazil from 2003 to 2011, but the country was not nearly as polarized then, and the economic tailwinds were far stronger. Mr. Lula's election caps a leftist wave in Latin America, with six of the region's seven largest countries electing leftist leaders since 2018, fueled by an anti-incumbent backlash.
Mr. Bolsonaro's decision to spend at least the first weeks of Mr. Lula's presidency in Florida shows his unease about his future in Brazil. Mr. Bolsonaro, 67, is linked to five separate inquiries, including one into his release of documents related to a classified investigation, another on his attacks on Brazil's voting machines and another into his potential connections to "digital militias" that spread misinformation on his behalf.
As a regular citizen, Mr. Bolsonaro will now lose the prosecutorial immunity he had as president. Some cases against him will probably be moved to local courts from the Supreme Court.
Some top federal prosecutors who have worked on the cases believe there is enough evidence to convict Mr. Bolsonaro, particularly in the case related to the release of classified material, according to a top federal prosecutor who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential investigations.
On Sunday, Mr. Lula told Congress that Mr. Bolsonaro could face consequences. "We have no intention of revenge against those who tried to subjugate the nation to their personal and ideological plans, but we will guarantee the rule of law," he said. "Those who have done wrong will answer for their mistakes."
It is unlikely that Mr. Bolsonaro's presence in the United States could protect him from prosecution in Brazil. Still, Florida has become a sort of refuge for conservative Brazilians in recent years.
Prominent pundits on some of Brazil's most popular talk shows are based in Florida. A far-right provocateur who faces arrest in Brazil for threatening judges has lived in Florida as he awaits a response to his political asylum request in the United States. And Carla Zambelli, one of Mr. Bolsonaro's top allies in Brazil's Congress, fled to Florida for nearly three weeks after she was filmed pursuing a man at gunpoint on the eve of the election.
Mr. Bolsonaro plans to stay in Florida for one to three months, giving him some distance to observe whether Mr. Lula's administration will push any of the investigations against him, according to a close friend of the Bolsonaro family who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private plans. The Brazilian government has also authorized four aides to spend a month in Florida with Mr. Bolsonaro, according to an official notice.
On Saturday, Mr. Bolsonaro greeted his new neighbors in the driveway of his rented Orlando house, many of them Brazilian immigrants who took selfies with the departing president. He then went to a KFC to eat.
It is not uncommon for former heads of state to live in the United States for posts in academia or similar ventures. But it is unusual for a head of state to seek safe haven in the United States from possible prosecution at home, particularly when the home country is a democratic U.S. ally.
Mr. Bolsonaro and his allies argue that he is a political target of Brazil's left and particularly Brazil's Supreme Court. They have largely dropped claims that the election was rigged because of voter fraud but instead now claim that it was unfair because Alexandre de Moraes, a Supreme Court justice who runs Brazil's election agency, tipped the scales for Mr. Lula.
Mr. Moraes was an active player in the election, suspending the social-media accounts of many of Mr. Bolsonaro's supporters and granting Mr. Lula more television time because of misleading statements in Mr. Bolsonaro's political ads. Mr. Moraes has said he needed to act to counter the antidemocratic stances of Mr. Bolsonaro and his supporters. Some legal experts worry that he abused his power, often acting unilaterally in ways that go far beyond that of a typical Supreme Court judge.
Still, Mr. Bolsonaro has faced widespread criticism, on both the right and the left, for his response to his election loss. After suggesting for months he would dispute any loss -- firing up his supporters and worrying his critics -- he instead went silent, refusing to acknowledge Mr. Lula's victory publicly. His administration carried out the transition as he receded from the spotlight and many of his official duties.
On Saturday night, in his departing speech to the nation, even his vice president, Hamilton Mourão, a former general, made clear his views on Mr. Bolsonaro's final moments as president.
"Leaders that should reassure and unite the nation around a project for the country have let their silence or inopportune and harmful protagonism create a climate of chaos and social disintegration," Mr. Mourão said.

But I’ve been covering show business in this dynamic city too long to get too sentimental. We shouldn’t overly fetishize institutions. One of the legacies of “Stomp,” which closes this month after a 29-year run, is all the shows that did not get produced in its theater. Change is good.
And yet, I couldn’t help but feel a little melancholy walking down the steps into Caroline’s for the last time, a steep descent that gave you a chance to adjust from the gaudy lights of Times Square. Caroline’s isn’t technically gone; after a final show on New Year’s Eve, it is producing the New York Comedy Festival and other unnamed projects. Still, with the stage backdrop, stools and other parts of the club soon to be shipped to the National Comedy Center in Jamestown, New York, the loss of this room is significant.
When Caroline’s opened in Chelsea in 1981 (it had two homes before moving to the theater district in the next decade), New York comedy clubs were essentially dive bars with stages, featuring packed bills of short sets by lowly paid or unpaid comics desperate for performing time to work out jokes. Caroline’s introduced a new model: hour sets by more established talent, bigger paydays and a more upscale atmosphere. There was plush carpeting and a dressing room. Instead of a brick wall, the comics stood in front of a checkerboard pattern artfully missing a few pieces. In a 1985 story in The New York Times, Robert Morton, a producer on “Late Night with David Letterman,” described Caroline’s as “the first yuppie comedy club,” becoming maybe the last person to use that word as a compliment.
Many were exposed to the club via the television show “Caroline’s Comedy Hour,” which ended in the mid-’90s. Its impressive lineups offer a history of modern standup. On one 1992 episode, Attell performed with Dave Chappelle, Louis C.K., Jon Stewart, Susie Essman and Colin Quinn.
That Caroline’s was located in the heart of Broadway mattered, adding a touch of class to standup, an art form rooted in vaudeville and minstrel shows that was then rarely afforded the critical respect of theater and film. Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the club, played a key role in raising the stature of standup. You can even make the case that she helped set the stage for the transformation of Times Square, opening just a few years before Disney arrived in the neighborhood.
On Friday before the show, when I asked about her most memorable nights at the club, Hirsch recalled the time Robin Williams took over a Jeff Garlin set with some inspired heckling and a string of performances by Kevin Hart. She also told a story about how Don King walked into the club when John Witherspoon was telling a joke about him. Her recollections underlined the real importance of Caroline’s: the staggering number of memorable experiences had there. I had more than my share.
Caroline’s was the only place where I saw veteran stars like Dick Gregory, Richard Lewis and Damon Wayans. Before he was on “Saturday Night Live,” I caught Michael Che there. And years before he had a special, I knew that Ricky Velez would get one after watching him do an electric opening set. The most memorable part of a Tiffany Haddish show was when she spotted Whoopi Goldberg in the audience and tearfully described how important it was as a child to see the veteran star on television.
Caroline’s was not dogmatic about the kinds of comics it booked. It didn’t have a house style, which might have hurt its brand but made it unpredictable, featuring talent from an array of ages, backgrounds and styles. Bo Burnham cut an album there early in his career, and Phoebe Robinson got her start by taking a comedy class at Caroline’s.
One of the all-time funniest shows I ever saw was Rory Scovel doing an hour at Caroline’s. A decade before John Mulaney toured arenas with bits about fame and addiction, he performed a hilarious hour at Caroline’s in which he told jokes about his marriage and his alcoholism.
Caroline’s was also not above oddball bookings (Larry “Bud” Melman performed there). I once saw a 13-year-old do a standup act and also made the error of taking my 7-year-old daughter to a Ron Funches show, only to rush out when the jokes became too dirty.
Toward the end of the night, Attell asked his opening acts, Ian Fidance, Jordan Jensen and Wil Sylvince to join him onstage. They riffed with one another, before Attell turned to the crowd and asked with an odd formality: “May I?” Then he took out a blue recorder, which he described as “somewhere between a flute and a bong.”
In between raunchy jokes, he played simple, wistful songs. He remarked on the sadness of the instrument’s sound. Then he opened his jacket and brought out a second recorder, a yellow one. Seeing this gruff, grizzled legend wield two colorful pipes was its own sight gag. It was also a reminder that while Attell’s much imitated delivery has its own musicality, when it comes to expressing certain kinds of emotion, no joke can really match a few notes played with conviction.
Then he beckoned Caroline Hirsch to the stage, called her “a force” and thanked her for “making us all better.” Describing the moment as “bittersweet,” she said she would be producing more shows in the future. Then everyone took selfies onstage to commemorate the moment and awkwardly shuffled off the stage. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

BRASÍLIA, Brazil — President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is expected to take the reins of the Brazilian government Sunday in an elaborate inauguration, complete with a motorcade, music festival and hundreds of thousands of supporters filling the central esplanade of Brasília, the nation’s capital.
But one key person will be missing: the departing far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro.
Without him, there will be no ceremonial passing of the presidential sash Sunday, an important symbol of the peaceful transition of power in a nation where many people still recall the 21-year military dictatorship that ended in 1985.
Instead, Bolsonaro woke up Sunday 6,000 miles away, in a rented house owned by a professional mixed-martial-arts fighter a few miles from Disney World. Facing various investigations from his time in his office, Bolsonaro flew to Orlando on Friday night and plans to stay in Florida for at least a month.
Bolsonaro had questioned the reliability of Brazil’s election systems for months, without evidence, and when he lost in October, he refused to concede unequivocally. In a sort of farewell address Friday, breaking weeks of near silence, he said he tried to block Lula from taking office but failed.
“Within the laws, respecting the constitution, I searched for a way out of this,” he said. He then appeared to encourage his supporters to move on. “We live in a democracy or we don’t,” he said. “No one wants an adventure.”
That message did not appear to resonate with many supporters. Thousands remained camped outside the army headquarters in Brasília, as they have been since the election, many saying they were convinced that at the final moment Sunday, the military would prevent Lula from taking office.
“The army will step in,” said Magno Rodrigues, 60, a former mechanic and janitor who gives daily speeches at the protests. “The army has patriotism and love for the country, and in the past, the army did the same thing.” He was referencing the 1964 military coup that ushered in the dictatorship.
Rodrigues has spent the past nine weeks camped outside the army headquarters, sleeping in a tent on a narrow pad with his wife. He provided a tour of the encampment, which had become a small village since Bolsonaro lost the election. It has showers, a laundry service, cellphone-charging stations, a hospital, 28 food stalls and even a system for relieving oneself inside the tent.
The Brazilian army has allowed the protesters to remain but has shown no signs of intervening in the government handover. The protests have been overwhelmingly nonviolent — with more praying than rioting — but a small group of people have set fire to vehicles. Lula’s transitional government has suggested that the encampments will not be tolerated for much longer.
How long was Rodrigues prepared to stay? “As long as it takes to liberate my country,” he said, dressed in a leather jacket and leaning on a cane outside the portable toilets. “For the rest of my life if I have to.”
Elsewhere in Brasília, it was a party. Hundreds of thousands of people streamed into the sprawling, planned capital, founded in 1960 to house the Brazilian government, with many dressed in the bright red of Lula’s leftist Workers’ Party.
Passengers on arriving planes broke into rally songs about Lula, revelers danced to samba at New Year’s Eve parties and, across the city, spontaneous cries rang out from balconies and street corners, heralding Lula’s arrival and Bolsonaro’s exit.
“Lula’s inauguration is mainly about hope,” said Isabela Nascimento, 30, a software developer walking to the festivities Sunday. “I hope to see him representing not only a political party, but an entire population — a whole group of people who just want to be happier.”
Lula, 77, completes a stunning political comeback Sunday. He was once Brazil’s most popular president, leaving office with an approval rating above 80%. He then served 580 days in prison, from 2018 to 2019, on corruption charges that he accepted a condo and renovations from construction companies bidding on government contracts.
After those convictions were thrown out because the Supreme Court ruled that the judge in Lula’s case was biased, he ran for the presidency again — and won.
Lula and his supporters maintain that he was the victim of political persecution. Bolsonaro and his supporters say Brazil now has a criminal as president.
The absence of Bolsonaro and the presence of thousands of protesters who believe the election was stolen illustrate the deep divide and tall challenges that Lula will now face in his third term as president of Latin America’s biggest country and one of the world’s largest democracies.
He oversaw a boom in Brazil from 2003 to 2011, but the country was not nearly as polarized then, and the economic tail winds were far stronger. Lula’s election caps a leftist wave in Latin America, with six of the region’s seven largest countries electing leftist leaders since 2018, fueled by an anti-incumbent backlash.
Bolsonaro’s decision to spend at least the first weeks of Lula’s presidency in Florida also shows his unease about his future in Brazil. Bolsonaro, 67, is linked to five separate inquiries, including one into his release of documents related to a classified investigation, another on his attacks on Brazil’s voting machines and another into his potential connections to “digital militias” that spread misinformation on his behalf.
As a regular citizen, Bolsonaro will lose the prosecutorial immunity he had as president. Some cases against him will probably be moved to local courts from the Supreme Court.
Some top federal prosecutors who have worked on the cases believe there is enough evidence to convict Bolsonaro, particularly in the case related to the release of classified material, according to a top federal prosecutor who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential investigations.
It is unlikely that Bolsonaro’s presence in the United States could protect him from prosecution in Brazil. Still, Florida has become a sort of refuge for conservative Brazilians in recent years.
Prominent pundits on some of Brazil’s most popular talk shows are based in Florida. A far-right provocateur who faces arrest in Brazil for threatening judges has lived in Florida as he awaits a response to his political asylum request in the United States. And Carla Zambelli, one of Bolsonaro’s top allies in Brazil’s Congress, fled to Florida for nearly three weeks after she was filmed pursuing a man at gunpoint on the eve of the election.
“We have freedom here,” said Rodrigo Constantino, a prominent Brazilian right-wing commentator who lives near Miami.
Bolsonaro plans to stay in Florida for one to three months, giving him some distance to observe whether Lula’s administration will push any of the investigations against him, according to a close friend of the Bolsonaro family who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private plans.
“He will try to stay low for a while — to disappear,” Constantino said.
On Saturday, Bolsonaro greeted his new neighbors in the driveway of his rented Orlando house, many of them Brazilian immigrants who took selfies with the departing president. He then went to a KFC to eat.
It is not uncommon for former heads of state to live in the United States for posts in academia or similar ventures. But it is unusual for a head of state to seek safe haven in the United States from possible prosecution at home, particularly when the home country is a democratic U.S. ally.
Bolsonaro and his allies argue that he is a political target of Brazil’s left and particularly Brazil’s Supreme Court. They have largely dropped claims that the election was rigged because of voter fraud, but instead now claim that it was unfair because Alexandre de Moraes, a Supreme Court justice who runs Brazil’s election agency, tipped the scales for Lula.
Moraes was an active player in the election, suspending the social-media accounts of many of Bolsonaro’s supporters and granting Lula more television time because of misleading statements in Bolsonaro’s political ads. Moraes has said he needed to act to counter the antidemocratic stances of Bolsonaro and his supporters. Some legal experts worry that he has abused his power, often acting unilaterally in ways that go far beyond that of a typical Supreme Court judge.
Still, Bolsonaro has faced widespread criticism, on both the right and the left, for his response to his election loss. After suggesting for months he would dispute any loss — firing up his supporters and worrying his critics — he instead went silent, refusing to acknowledge Lula’s victory publicly. His administration carried out the transition as he receded from the spotlight and many of his official duties.
On Saturday night, in his departing speech to the nation, even his vice president, Hamilton Mourão, a former general, made clear his views on Bolsonaro’s final moments as president.
“Leaders that should reassure and unite the nation around a project for the country have let their silence or inopportune and harmful protagonism create a climate of chaos and social disintegration,” Mourão said. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

“Within the laws, respecting the constitution, I searched for a way out of this,” he said. He then appeared to encourage his supporters to move on. “We live in a democracy or we don’t,” he said. “No one wants an adventure.”
On Sunday, Lula ascended the ramp to the presidential offices with a diverse group of Brazilians, including a Black woman, a handicapped man, a 10-year-old boy, an Indigenous man and a factory worker. A voice then announced that Lula would accept the green-and-yellow sash from “the Brazilian people,” and Aline Sousa, a 33-year-old garbage collector, played the role of Bolsonaro and placed the sash on the new president.
In an address to Congress on Sunday, Lula said that he would fight hunger and deforestation, lift the economy and try to unite the country. But he also took aim at his predecessor, saying that Bolsonaro had threatened Brazil’s democracy.
“Under the winds of redemocratization, we used to say, ‘Dictatorship never again,’ ” he said. “Today, after the terrible challenge we’ve overcome, we must say, ‘Democracy forever.’ ”
Lula’s ascension to the presidency caps a stunning political comeback. He was once Brazil’s most popular president, leaving office with an approval rating above 80%.

Escaping From Kabul Was Supposed to Be the Hardest Part: [Sports Desk]

Full text: About 16 months into her new life in Australia, Fati, who was the Afghanistan women's soccer team's goalkeeper, can still be overwhelmed by "all the things I've lost." It's time to jump-start life, she said.
The New York Times Sports department is revisiting the subjects of some compelling articles from the last year or so. In August, we reported on a soccer player who fled her home in Afghanistan to begin a new life. Here is an update.
When her new life in Australia becomes too overwhelming, Fati, the goalkeeper for the Afghanistan national women's soccer team, heads to the beach in the nighttime.
She walks along the shoreline of Port Phillip Bay, where the skyline of Melbourne glows in the distance. She shines a flashlight on the colorful fish darting around the shallow water. And listening to the gentle lapping waves, she takes a deep breath and exhales.
There in the darkness and solitude, it's Fati's time to reflect. And to mourn.
"I try hard to relax and be calm, but I always end up thinking about all the things that have happened to me and all the things I've lost," she said. "I see that the water is endless, like my problems are endless."
(The New York Times is not using the last names of Fati and her teammates at their request because they fear retribution from the Taliban.)
About 16 months have gone by since Fati and her teammates on the national team risked their lives to escape Afghanistan after the Taliban took over the country. After The New York Times featured Fati in an article in late summer, she was offered paid speaking engagements, including one opportunity to speak at a law school graduation in California in 2023.
There is also a chance that her story will be turned into a dramatic film after more than a half-dozen people showed interest in buying the TV and film rights.
"Sometimes I feel like so strong and I want to keep sharing my story and motivating other people," she said. "I'm making a difference, I hope."
But none of that can magically heal her body and mind after running for her life from the Taliban, and then having no choice but to leave her parents and youngest sister behind.
Fati and most of her teammates on the national soccer squad were forced to leave Afghanistan without both parents because large groups often couldn't make it past the Taliban checkpoints and chaotic crowds on the way to the Kabul airport, and to freedom.
Fati, 19, now lives in a suburb of Melbourne with her older brother, a younger brother and a younger sister, and she has become their stand-in parents. Their parents and 5-year-old sister, Kawsar, are back in Kabul, barely making ends meet amid the country's economic collapse.
Some of Fati's teammates' families have left Afghanistan for relative safety in neighboring countries like Iran or Pakistan while they await Australian visas. But Fati's family has not had such luck. Her parents and Kawsar do not have passports, complicating a difficult situation.
Their immigration case has stalled in the system, and the potential cost for Fati to secure their exit from Afghanistan through backdoor channels is too much for her to pay. She and her family are Hazara, an ethnic group that is often discriminated against and targeted by the Taliban, and the price for those families to leave the country is in the thousands and can be more than twice the cost for non-Hazara families, she said.
"I try not to be negative, but if you want me to tell the truth, I am losing my hope that my family will get a visa," she said.
The thought of never seeing her family again, or waiting many years to see them, is unbearable, she said, because time already is going by so quickly. She is crushed that Kawsar is growing up without her.
Through daily video calls, Fati has noticed that her little sister has changed so much since they last saw each other in the melee outside the Kabul airport. Kawsar's hair is long now, and the English that Fati taught her is slipping away. No longer does Kawsar watch Disney animated films to learn English and improve her own prospects in life, the way Fati did. Kawsar also has stopped going to school because it is just too dangerous. The Taliban have barred girls and women from playing sports and also have barred girls from going to school past the sixth grade.
"She's not the same Kawsar as I knew," Fati said, choking up.
Fati does her best to help her family in Kabul by sending them money. And while once she was supporting just her parents and Kawsar there, now she is supporting nine people who live in her family's house. In recent months, her aunt moved in with her five children.
Already, there is not that much money to go around. Fati must pay the bills for her house in a suburb of Melbourne where she lives with her siblings, two teammates and one teammate's father.
Fati also wants to relocate into the city to save herself the hourlong commute to work and soccer training, but the housing in Melbourne is too expensive.
Her bank account balance bottomed out, once again, several months ago after her older brother, Khaliqyar, bought a car. She began working two jobs to help pay that bill.
Her first job was in the IT department at a financial services company that is a sponsor for the Afghan national team, now that the team plays for the Melbourne Victory professional soccer club in a state league in Australia. From that IT job, Fati would go straight to her second job, an overnight shift at a pizza restaurant, preparing food and washing dishes until 4 a.m.
The schedule was so grueling that Fati often had headaches and could hardly keep her eyes open, and began to oversleep and miss days at her office job. So when Khaliqyar landed a steady job at a painting company, she quit the pizza place.
Now, Fati is able to focus on her soccer training and leadership activities, which include being a spokeswoman for her national team, a squad that is frustrated because it hasn't been able to play any international matches.
The Afghanistan Football Federation deactivated the women's national team program when the players left the country, a spokesman there said, and FIFA, the global governing body of the sport, has ignored the team's request to be reinstated.
"I'm trying not to cry about the team anymore, but it's hard," she said. "I just want to turn on my Afghani mode and work hard to be a good goalkeeper and keep dreaming about playing in the World Cup someday."
In August, the anniversaries of Fati leaving Kabul and arriving in Australia were among her toughest days in recent years.
During that time, she found it too hard to focus on her English class and dropped out of the course, which she said made her even more distraught and depressed. Several weeks later, there was an attack on an education center in Kabul that killed many Hazara students, including one of her teammate Bahara's relatives.
Fati, Bahara and some of the other players went to the beach that night to find solace, and the women spent the night wiping their tears.
"I look at the water and I know the water is so cold, and I'm afraid that my heart is also getting cold," Fati said that night.
These days, she is applying for scholarships to a local university so she and her sister Zahra can start classes next semester. It's time to jump-start life, Fati said.
When she was a teenager, she wanted to be an archaeologist, and Fati still wants to see the pyramids in Egypt and visit China's Great Wall. She also wants to play soccer for her country again.
"I'm so much afraid of time and I think about dying, so I know I have to use every opportunity," she said. "What if all of my time goes by and I never see my family? What if I die without reaching my dreams?"
