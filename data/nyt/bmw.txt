Full text: On China's snowy border with Russia, a dealership that sells trucks has seen its sales double in the past year thanks to Russian customers. China's exports to its neighbor are so strong that Chinese construction workers built warehouses and 20-story office towers at the border this summer.
The border town Heihe is a microcosm of China's ever closer economic relationship with Russia. China is profiting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has led Russia to switch from the West to China for purchases of everything from cars to computer chips.
Russia, in turn, has sold oil and natural gas to China at deep discounts. Russian chocolates, sausages and other consumer goods have become plentiful in Chinese supermarkets. Trade between Russia and China surpassed $ 200 billion in the first 11 months of this year, a level the countries had not expected to reach until 2024.
Russia's war in Ukraine has also gotten an image boost from China. State media disseminates a steady diet of Russian propaganda in China and around the world. Russia is so popular in China that social media influencers flock to Harbin, the capital of China's northernmost province in the east, Heilongjiang, to pose in Russian garb in front of a former Russian cathedral there.
Xi Jinping, China's top leader, and Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, have made numerous public demonstrations of the nations' close ties. Mr. Xi visited Harbin in early September and declared Heilongjiang to be China's "gateway to the north." China's exports to Russia soared 69 percent in the first 11 months of this year compared with the same period in 2021, before the invasion of Ukraine.
"Maintaining and developing China-Russian relations well is a strategic choice made by both sides on the basis of the fundamental interests of the two peoples," Mr. Xi said as he met in Beijing on Wednesday with the Russian prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin.
China has filled a critical import need for Russia, which many European and American companies shunned after Mr. Putin started his war in February 2022. China has pursued its role as a substitute supplier of goods despite risking its close economic ties with many European nations.
Before the Ukraine invasion, leaders of Germany, France and other European countries mostly set aside differences with China over issues like human rights to emphasize commerce. Chinese officials, for their part, insist that they should not be forced to choose between Europe and Russia, and that China should be free to do business with both.
The biggest winners for China from the surge in trade with Russia have been its vehicle manufacturers.
On a recent afternoon in Heihe, lines of diesel freight trucks with decals of snarling bears, a symbol of Russia, on their drivers' doors waited to be driven across an Amur River bridge to Russia. The bridge is new, and so are the trucks, which wore Genlyon badges, a brand that belongs to the state-owned Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation. The company, known as SAIC, also makes car brands like MG, acquired from Britain.
The sales helped China overtake Japan this year as the world's largest car exporter. German manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz and BMW used to be strong sellers in Russia, but they have pulled out in response to sanctions on the country by Europe, the United States and their allies.
Sales of luxury cars in Russia have plunged, contributing to a decline in the overall size of the country's car market, which is now less than half the size of Germany's. But lower-middle-class and poor Russian families, whose members make up the bulk of the soldiers fighting the war, have stepped up purchases of affordable Chinese cars, according to Alexander Gabuev, the director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.
One reason, Mr. Gabuev said, are the death and disability payments that the Russian government and insurers are making to families of Russian soldiers -- as much as $ 90,000 in the case of a death.
Russia has not released the number of its killed and wounded, but the United States estimates the total at 315,000.
Russians buy almost exclusively internal combustion cars. China has a surplus of them because its consumers have shifted swiftly to electric cars.
And the land border means China can transport cars to Russia by rail, an important factor because China lacks its own fleet of transoceanic carrier ships for vehicle exports.
The result? Chinese carmakers have grabbed 55 percent of the Russian market, according to GlobalData Automotive. They had 8 percent in 2021.
"Never before have we seen automakers from a single country gobble up so much market share so quickly -- the Chinese came into a windfall," said Michael Dunne, an Asia automotive consultant in San Diego.
The United States has strongly warned China against sending armaments to Russia, and has not yet uncovered evidence that it is doing so. But some civilian equipment that China is selling to Russia, like drones and trucks, also has military uses.
Beijing's embrace of Russia has also provided a modest but timely boon to China's construction industry. The economy has struggled to heal from the scars left by almost three years of stringent "zero Covid" measures.
The real estate market is in crisis across China. Tens of millions of apartments are empty or unfinished, and new projects have stalled -- depriving the construction sector of work that has long powered jobs.
"Many buildings have been built, but without anyone living inside," said Zhang Yan, a wooden door vendor in Heihe.
But some laborers are finding work on the 2,600-mile Russian border, which until this year had a dearth of truck stops, customs processing centers, rail yards, pipelines and other infrastructure. Construction moved ahead briskly over the summer in cities like Heihe, although it has paused for the frigid winter.
Pipelines are needed for one of the most crucial commodities traded between the two countries: energy.
Cheap Russian energy, bypassing sanctions imposed by the West, has helped Chinese factories compete in global markets even as their manufacturing rivals elsewhere, notably in Germany, have faced sharply higher energy costs for much of the past two years.
Russia has been ramping up natural gas shipments through its Power of Siberia pipeline to China, and has been negotiating to build a second one that would carry gas from fields that served Europe before the Ukraine war. China and Russia also agreed less than three weeks before the Ukraine war to build a third, smaller pipeline that would carry gas from easternmost Russia to northeastern China, and construction on that project has raced ahead.
The newest pipeline will cross land that Russia seized from China in the late 1850s and never returned. As recently as the 1960s, China and the Soviet Union were quarreling over the placement of their border and their troops skirmished. In a village near Heihe, a larger-than-life-size statue of an imperial Chinese general still glares across the Amur River.
Today Russia and China are building bridges and pipelines that cross it.

China's Auto Giant BYD Sells More Electric Cars And Hybrids Than Ever: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sales by BYD, the country's dominant automaker, topped 3 million last year, including 1.6 million fully battery-powered cars. It's a sign of China's rapid growth in EVs.
The Chinese corporate giant BYD said Monday that it sold three million battery-powered cars in 2023, its most ever, capping a turbulent year for China's electric vehicle industry.
Even as sales surged, heavy competition and a sustained price war took a financial toll on many automakers.
But BYD last year sold 1.6 million fully electric vehicles and another 1.4 million hybrids, which are powered by both batteries and gasoline. Together that is a 62 percent increase over 2022. BYD is also making money, tripling its profit to $ 1.5 billion in the first half of last year.
All told, Chinese automakers are expected to have sold about 9.4 million electric vehicles and hybrids last year, an increase from 6.9 million in 2022, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. The group said it expected sales in 2024 to rise again, to 11.5 million.
Already the world's largest automobile market, China is now also its fastest growing, racing ahead in the electric vehicle transition that is upending the global industry. China rules the supply chain for battery-powered cars -- from the mining and processing of cobalt and other minerals used in batteries, to the deployment of robots in factories that make cars and trucks. China's electric vehicle companies and their suppliers employ some 1.5 million people.
A big reason for China's early lead in electric vehicles was the government's heavy financial support for the industry's development. After financial incentives for consumers expired at the end of 2022, automakers slashed car prices to lure buyers. Many companies, including BYD, introduced another round of cuts this fall, intensifying the price war.
In November, BYD advertised discounts on five models of up to 18,000 renminbi ( $ 2,550). Another Chinese electric vehicle company, Ji Yue, a partnership of Geely and Baidu, slashed the price of all versions of its first model by RMB 30,000 ( $ 4,200) in November.
Last year's price cutting was started by Tesla, the American automaker that has a factory in Shanghai. In January 2023 it lowered prices in China for the second time in three months, and others followed.
Tesla is expected this week to report a big jump in its worldwide sales after slashing prices at the end of last year, and as customers took advantage of U.S. tax breaks. Founded in 2003, Tesla is on a path to sell about 1.8 million battery powered vehicles for the year, up from 1.3 million in 2022. It makes about half of all electric vehicles sold in the United States.
As Tesla and BYD rival for the spot as the world's most prolific maker of fully electric vehicles, both companies face increasing competition from legacy automakers that are spending billions of dollars to catch up.
"I think an industry shakeout is an inevitable trend," said Cui Dongshu, the secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association, which represents the country's domestic industry. "But it's still uncertain who will seize the future leading position in the long term."
As fast as China's electric vehicle sales are rising, companies are pouring money into factories and research, often fueled by loans from state-owned banks and assistance from municipalities. Nio, a top selling Chinese EV brand, said in November that it laid off 10 percent of its employees.
During the last year, Tesla has lost market share to rivals like General Motors, Hyundai, Ford Motor and Volkswagen as they introduced more electric vehicles.
BYD, which faces prohibitively high tariffs in the U.S. market, sells most of its cars in China but is expanding globally, particularly in Europe.
It announced in December that it would build an assembly plant in Hungary, its first production facility for battery-powered cars in Europe. In Germany, the seat of European auto making, it introduced three models of electric cars at the start of 2023. BYD has opened dealerships in Germany, Norway and Sweden.
As global competition for electric vehicles has gotten more intense, the political ramifications have been heightened. United States policymakers have made it harder for foreign companies to become partners with American companies.
And in Europe, lawmakers are investigating China's state subsidies, a step that could lead to tariffs imposed by the European Union.
Yet Europe's auto industry can't ignore China as a customer and business partner.
BMW, which has more than 30,000 employees in China, announced last spring that it would invest about $ 1.4 billion in battery assembly capacity at its factory in Shenyang in China's northeast.
Volkswagen, which counts China as its largest sales market, is moving more of its supply chain and manufacturing to China. The German giant is hiring thousands of Chinese engineers to design electric cars at its industrial complex in Hefei, a city in central China.

Actor's Death Highlights South Korea's Drug Policy: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The actor, Lee Sun-kyun, had been questioned on suspicion of drug use in a country that has long drawn a hard line against anything other than total abstinence.
Lee Sun-kyun, the "Parasite" actor who was found dead on Wednesday, was far from the only celebrity entangled in South Korea's latest antidrug crackdown.
Yoo Ah-in, the actor known for his roles in the 2018 film "Burning" and the 2021 Netflix series "Hellbound," is facing trial after testing positive for propofol, marijuana, ketamine and cocaine, officials say. Several South Korean retailers have cut ties with the actor since the drug accusations became public. He is no longer listed as a cast member for the second season of "Hellbound."
G-Dragon, the rapper and former member of the K-pop boy group BigBang, had been under investigation for possible drug use until the police dropped the case earlier this month after he tested negative on several drug tests. Nevertheless, BMW Korea removed images of him from its online advertisements.
The recent accusations against high-profile entertainers here have highlighted the continuation of a strict antidrug policy and attitudes in South Korea that have drawn a hard line against anything other than total abstinence from drug use.
Some officials hail that toughness as critical to keeping drug use under control. But the policies have also come under criticism from treatment experts who say that the authorities focus too much on punishment rather than rehabilitation.
"When you look at data and you look at the harsh penalties that have been in place for decades now, they haven't worked," said Gloria Lai, a regional director for the International Drug Policy Consortium, an organization that promotes evidence-based drug policies around the world. "And the cost on people's lives is huge."
Since Mr. Lee's death, the police in Incheon, a city west of Seoul, who had questioned him on suspicion of using marijuana and ketamine, have been criticized for their treatment of Mr. Lee during the investigation, saying it was disproportionate to the severity of the allegations against him.
Seongcheol Park, Mr. Lee's lawyer, denied the drug charges and accused the police of violating rules about the public release of information. He said Mr. Lee had tested negative in multiple drug tests.
Mr. Park added that the police had intensively investigated the allegations that Mr. Lee had used drugs but did not take seriously enough his assertion that he had been the target of blackmail.
"The process was insulting and humiliating to him, even though there was no evidence that he had taken drugs," Mr. Park said in a telephone interview. "While it's true that drug investigations are necessary, it's a problem when they go too far and don't follow procedures and protocols."
Kim Hui-jung, the Incheon police chief, defended the investigation at a news conference on Thursday. He said that his agency had performed properly and legally, "based on specific informant statements and evidence."
South Korea's tough stance on drugs is in line with that of some other countries in Asia. A drug conviction can carry the death penalty in China and Singapore. Japan and Taiwan, too, have maintained minimal tolerance for drug use. Governments in Japan and Singapore have publicly spoken out against a strategy called harm reduction that has become more prominent in Western nations, Ms. Lai said.
"A harm reduction approach is controversial," she said, "because you're basically saying that, even if someone continues to use drugs, you think that they still deserve to be treated with care and with access to health services."
South Korea stands apart from countries like the United States, Canada and some in Europe, which approach drug use as a public health matter rather than simply a criminal one.
Still, South Korea's drug policies, combined with its geographic isolation, have helped keep drug use low, experts say.
But reports of trafficking and use have surged in the past few years, though experts say it is difficult to obtain accurate data on drugs in South Korea because of stigma and the fear of imprisonment. Drug-related arrests, including for its consumption and sale, rose to more than 17,000 this year from about 10,400 in 2019, according to official data. Among them, teens were the age group with the largest growth, jumping sixfold to 1,000 arrests from 160. It is unclear whether that increase in arrests represents an actual spike in drug use, or whether intensified enforcement is playing an outsize role.
President Yoon Suk Yeol and officials in his politically conservative government declared a "war on drugs" after taking office in 2022, warning that drugs were becoming more accessible nationwide. Celebrities have also led "just say no" campaigns on social media. Some talk shows have dedicated entire episodes to antidrug programming.
The country's latest crackdown, and the rhetoric of Mr. Yoon and officials in his administration, have echoed the "war on drugs" of the 1970s and '80s in the United States, said Hyeouk Chris Hahm, a professor at the Boston University School of Social Work.
"Cracking down with these harsh punishments and unreasonably long years of imprisonment is not going to be effective" in reducing drug use and overdose deaths, Professor Hahm said. "And we know that from the history of the U.S."
South Koreans can even be prosecuted upon returning home for using drugs outside the country. Once convicted of using illicit drugs, a person can be required to complete a mandatory education program run by the Justice Ministry, or be imprisoned, said Yoon Hyunjun, a drug policy expert at Sogang University in Seoul.
A prison sentence can range from six months to four years, depending on the type of drug. For trafficking, the sentence can be up to 14 years.
Drug treatment experts say that the country's approach is too narrowly focused on punishment. The mandatory education program that offenders take is not individualized enough to each person's needs and does not provide a sustainable plan to overcome addiction, Ms. Yoon said. While the government has called for more rehab clinics for drug users, they remain far fewer than those for alcoholics.
"In our country, drug rehabilitation is less often viewed as an effort to overcome addiction than as a penalty," Ms. Yoon said. "People's mind-sets are focused strictly on punishment."
But public policy experts warned that approaching drug use only in a punitive way falls short at curbing drug use, addictions and overdose deaths.
"It needs to be in tandem with education, changing the culture and good infrastructure for addiction treatment," said Jimi Huh, a professor of public health at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California. "Having a punitive policy only -- that's not going to cut it."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: You may have forgotten -- or wanted to forget -- what happened on the internet in 2023. We're here to refresh your memory.
Algorithms are getting good, alarmingly so, at feeding you content targeted to your weird and wonderful and even secret interests. Still, a lot of interesting stories end up falling outside our digital castle walls. This list is an attempt to rectify that, revisiting the people, trends, feuds and frenzies that took off on social media platforms in 2023 but might not have broken into your personal World Wide Web.
Did you see the olive oil executive trying to start beef with another olive oil executive on LinkedIn? How about the woman who gets paid thousands of dollars by pretending to be a video game character? Or the young Texan who is facing prison time after his lavish wedding blew up on TikTok? We've got you covered.
The Inexplicable
Hail, Caesar?
Find a man, any man, and ask him how often he thinks about the Roman Empire. According to TikTok, the answer is at least once a day. Viral videos on the platform inspired a "Saturday Night Live" sketch in November. "The Roman Empire, Ancient Rome," rapped the episode's guest host, Jason Momoa. "Five times a day, it pops into my dome."
Don't Call It a Snack
Girl Dinner was a big summertime TikTok trend. A number of people -- mostly young women, as the name implies -- showed off nicely arranged plates comprising a bit of this (cheese), a bit of that (bread, maybe) and a few other things (pickle spear, nuts, salami slice). Proponents said the trend freed them from the tyranny of traditional dinner. Detractors claimed it glorified eating disorders.
A Yassified Barney
After Barney the purple dinosaur got a makeover in February, baffled fans filled the internet with talk of the character's new teeth, brighter purple skin, larger eyes and perhaps even a bit of rhinoplasty. (Make that dinoplasty. I'll be here all article.)
The Return of Joe Cool
The "Peanuts" dog created by Charles M. Schulz found a new generation of fans this year. In April, the American Red Cross was inundated with young people looking to donate blood in exchange for a limited-edition Snoopy T-shirt. In October, The Atlantic labeled the cartoon beagle "The Hero Gen Z Needs."
A Broadway-Style Rap. What Could Go Wrong?
Ariana DeBose's opening number at the British Academy Film Awards in February quickly became a meme. Was it bizarre? Yes. Could you look away? Absolutely not. Ms. DeBose, a member of the original "Hamilton" cast, brought the earnest enthusiasm of a Broadway star to a rap that included the lines "Angela Bassett did the thing / Viola Davis, my Woman King." Social media loved it. And hated it.
An Underground Star
Sabrina Bahsoon, a law school graduate in her early twenties, racked up millions of online views this year by filming herself lip-syncing in the London Underground amid unsuspecting commuters. Tube Girl, as she was known, inspired numerous copycats.
The Edible
Gimme Five Margaritas!
On the campus of Louisiana State University in May, Cindy Smock, a 65-year-old evangelical preacher, tried to sell students on the benefits of abstinence by listing the sexual acts that women will supposedly perform after drinking certain numbers of margaritas. Shortly after a video of Sister Cindy's sermon hit social media, her words inspired a banger of a tune (known as "Gimme One Margarita") that became TikTok's song of the summer.
Mm, Mm, Good?
The writer and comedian Annie Rauwerda stirred up a big reaction on the internet -- and in her Brooklyn neighborhood -- when she cooked a pot of vegan stew for over a month this summer. Her concoction was based on the "perpetual stews" of culinary lore, and Ms. Rauwerda brought it to a playground each week for anyone who wanted a taste. As it bubbled and steamed in the pot, she encouraged people to toss in their own ingredients, so that it never tasted the same way twice.
The Milkshake of Death
In June, McDonald's added something to its menu: the Grimace Shake, named in honor of the purple bloblike creature who has long been a foil to the chain's signature clown. The beverage soon gave rise to a TikTok trend: In video after video, creators started out by pretending to give a positive review of the shake -- only to end up dead in a pool of purple goo. Did McDonald's mind? Nope. "This is free advertising," said Jonah Berger, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania.
Atlanta Gets Keith Lee'd
Keith Lee, a food obsessive with more than 15 million TikTok followers, has posted influential reviews of restaurants in Chicago, Detroit and Los Angeles. But he might have had his biggest effect during a visit to Atlanta in the fall, when he gave voice to the gripes of local restaurant-goers by dragging establishments that charged extra for butter, syrup and hot sauce. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution noted Mr. Lee's power over the city's dining scene in a story headlined "Move over, Michelin, Atlanta just got Keith Lee'd."
The Technically Edible
A Viral Campus Concoction
Social media helped spread the popularity of a campus drink, BORG, an acronym for "blackout rage gallon." In viral TikTok videos, student mixologists filled plastic gallon jugs with water, alcohol, sweet flavorings and a hangover remedy, like Pedialyte. "You don't taste any of the liquor, which is the great part," one college student said. Officials were less pleased by the trend. In March, the Amherst Fire Department in Amherst, Mass., reported 28 requests for ambulance transports during a BORG-fueled party at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
The Pesto Prompt
Susi Vidal, a TikTok creator in Arizona, posted a video in September about how to make homemade pesto. "Call me crazy if you want," she says at the start, "but I've never liked store-bought pesto." With that, Ms. Vidal inspired a wave of TikTok users to repost the opening of her video as the intro to much crazier confessional stories of their own about ghosts, bad dates and stalkers.
Krispy Meme
It was an image that launched a thousand Halloween costumes: Justin Bieber and his wife, Hailey, at a Krispy Kreme counter. In the photo, the celebrity couple appears to be dressed for wildly different functions, with perhaps neither appropriately attired for ordering and eating fresh doughnuts. Ms. Bieber is wearing a strapless red minidress and red heels; Mr. Bieber is outfitted in gray shorts, yellow Crocs and a pink baseball cap perched atop a gray hood. The picture was meant to promote Ms. Bieber's cosmetics line -- and it had the desired effect on the social media hive mind.
Ice Cream So Good
The TikTok creator PinkyDoll became a social media celebrity in July because of the livestreams and videos in which she played blank-eyed video game characters, the kind who says inane things like "Mmm, ice cream so good," which became a catchphrase. Though she was the subject of some online mockery, PinkyDoll made thousands of dollars from her online work.
The Audible
Big on Social
"Hello, Christ? I'm 'bout to sin again." That's a line from "You Wish," a song by the Los Angeles rap duo Flyana Boss that was huge on social media this summer. In the fall, a snippet of the song "Water," by the South African singer Tyla, swept the internet, thanks, in part, to the TikTok dance challenge that went with it. (In case you had finally gotten that one out of your head, its refrain goes: "Make me sweat/ Make me hotter/ Make me lose my breath / Make me water.") "Water" was followed by another TikTok earworm, "It Girl," by Aliyah Bah, whose multilayered fashion sense, known as Aliyahcore, trended online earlier in the year.
Cute and Cuter
Social media also fueled the rise of a number of novelty songs. A ditty created by pet owners to soothe anxious dog in elevators became an anthem for anxious humans everywhere. Sing it with me: "She's so brave / She's well behaved / She is not afraid!" A fiendishly catchy song from the children's puppet show "Nanalan"' introduced millions of people to Mona and the program's other super-cute characters. "Who's that wonderful girl?" the "Nanalan"' song goes. "Could she be any cuter?"
Spoofs Become Hits
"Planet of the Bass," a parody of a '90s Eurodance track, had a moment in August. Some internet users were amused, and others were horrified, by its kooky music video and baffling lyrics ("Women are my favorite guy"). Shout out DJ Crazy Times, also known as Kyle Gordon, a comedian in Brooklyn. In a similar vein, DJ Mandy, a 19-year-old student in California, made ripples this year as the Internet's most inept disc jockey. Social media users couldn't resist sharing videos that showed her making awkward mash-ups and beat drops, complete with a nonsensical transition from Flo Rida to Taylor Swift.
The Quiet Game
"Look around, everybody on mute," Beyoncé sang each night of her "Renaissance" tour. That line, from the song "Energy," gave rise to a social media challenge wherein audiences competed to see which crowd could be the most hushed. If you couldn't get tickets, the best seat in the house was a TikTok livestream.
The Nuptial
Emily Getting Married
Emily Mariko burst onto the viral scene in 2021 thanks to her simple recipe for salmon leftovers. In June, her California wedding became the talk of TikTok. People couldn't get enough of the details, from the brown bridesmaids dresses to Ms. Mariko's many outfit changes. It is unclear if salmon was served.
Sofia, Also Getting Married
This "quiet luxury" ceremony was anything but quiet. Social media users could not stop talking about the wedding of Sofia Richie Grainge, the daughter of Lionel Richie, to Elliot Grainge, a music executive. The soft, subtle makeup! The looks! The slicked-back bun! The South of France backdrop! Months after the April event, TikTok creators were still borrowing from Ms. Richie Grainge's wedding-day style.
TikTok's Wedding Fail
Lunden Stallings and Olivia Bennett built a huge following on TikTok, partly because of their country-club fashion sense. And so their October ceremony was highly anticipated by fans, who dubbed it TikTok's royal wedding. The excitement, however, was short-lived. Days after the event, old tweets resurfaced in which one of the brides had repeatedly used a racial slur. The couple issued an apology and added an "anti-racist resources" page to their website, but the damage was done.
There Goes the Groom
Jacob LaGrone and Madelaine Brockway, a wealthy young couple from Texas, caused an online stir thanks to their lavish wedding, a five-day affair that included stops at the Versailles, the Paris Opera house and a reception headlined by Adam Levine of Maroon 5. Ms. Brockway posted several wedding videos on TikTok, all of which went viral and caused commenters to ask, Who are these people? The videos were deleted a few days after the ceremony, when surprising facts emerged about the groom. Namely, that he had fired a gun at police officers from Westworth Village and Westover Hills, Texas, who were trying to serve him with an indictment in March. Mr. LaGrone is now facing a potential life sentence.
The Theatrical
An Oily Fight
A niche drama in the world of olive oil startups went online in April. The chief executive and co-founder of Graza logged on to LinkedIn -- a site not known as a forum for beefs -- to accuse another olive oil company of stealing his idea. The idea being a squeeze bottle.
Mascara Fraud?
Mikayla Nogueira, a beauty influencer known for her Boston accent, caused a bit of an online ruckus in January after posting an ad for L'Oreal Telescopic Life mascara. In the video, Ms. Nogueira appears to be wearing false eyelashes, rather than the product she was promoting. (Someone fibbed on the internet? For money? Say it ain't so!)
To Catch a Tabi Thief
Alex Dougé, a social media coordinator in New York, met a man named Josh on Tinder and brought him back to her apartment. The next morning she discovered that her Tabi Mary-Janes, a pricey shoe from the brand Margiela, were missing. After Ms. Dougé recapped the saga on TikTok, internet sleuths quickly located the man. It turned out that he had indeed stolen the prize shoes -- and given them to his girlfriend! Oh, the drama! Ms. Dougé eventually got her Tabis back, and social media welcomed a new addition to the roster of awful internet men.
Riverboat Brawl
A brawl on the Alabama riverfront made national news after a video of the incident went viral in August. The fight came about after five white boaters attacked a Black riverboat captain, who had instructed them to dock their pontoon elsewhere. A Black bystander joined the melee on the captain's behalf, wielding a folding chair as a weapon. In the brawl's aftermath, the humble folding chair became a symbol of resistance.
Viral Trial
Gwyneth Paltrow on trial for an accident on the slopes of the Deer Valley Resort in Utah was the internet gift that kept on giving. Social media platforms were blanketed with memes about the proceedings in March as jurors heard testimony on who was to blame for the collision -- the Oscar-winning actress or the retired optometrist who had sued her for more than $ 300,000. Online highlights included Ms. Paltrow's answer to the question of the "losses" she had suffered because of the incident. "Well," she said, "we lost half a day of skiing." The jury found her Gwynocent.
Apartment Madness
Emma Ganzarain, a resource management employee in Oslo, just wanted to share photos of her redecorated apartment with her TikTok followers. Before she moved in, she explained, her boyfriend had lived there by himself, and she believed that she had brought some order to the place. Outraged commenters did not agree, accusing Ms. Ganzarain of turning a homey apartment into a sad beige nightmare.
The Sartorial
These Boots Were Not Made For Walking
Fashion or marketing ploy? Cartoonish red boots were the talk of TikTok for a moment in February. The bloated footwear was designed by MSCHF, a New York collective with a knack for designing clothes and household goods that send the internet into a frenzy.
Law Roach (Kinda) Retires
Law Roach, an award-winning stylist for celebrities including Anne Hathaway and Celine Dion, created some confusion among the more fashion-conscious quarters of social media in March, when he abruptly announced that he was retiring, only to walk days later alongside Naomi Campbell in a runway show. He later clarified that he was retiring only from styling.
The Bed Bugs of Paris
What's French for schadenfreude? Amid the glam of Paris fashion week, a story crawled into the headlines. Bedbugs! Everywhere! Videos on social media raised the alarm by showing the little creatures scampering through the Paris Métro.
Platform as Runway
Kristina Avakyan, a New York resident, gained popularity on TikTok for videos in which she modeled eccentric outfits on subway platforms. She faced criticism after an interview with The Cut, in which she said that people in Harlem and Queens don't understand her fashion sense.
Endless A.I. Portraits
Throughout the year, A.I. generators spat out an images of people looking like modified, slightly shinier versions of themselves (with, occasionally, an extra finger or two). The A.I. yearbook photo generator was particularly popular on Instagram. But viewers beware! Pope Francis was not papped walking around in a puffy white Balenciaga coat. That was just some fairly convincing A.I. art.
The Mostly Delightful
A Hairbrush Microphone Masterpiece
The Mattison twins, a pair of TikTok creators, performed a funny lip-sync cover of Lady A's "Need You Now," singing into a hair brush suspended from the ceiling. (This hairbrush mic is one of the comedy duo's go-to props.) The low-quality video, posted in February, recalled the simpler comedy of the Vine era (2013-2017, R.I.P.).
Dances With Knives
An Instagram video of Britney Spears dancing in her home wielding two large knives grabbed the attention of viewers in September. Some concerned fans reported the video to the police, to Ms. Spears's chagrin. "So unacceptable for cops to listen to random fans and come in to my home unwarranted," she wrote on Instagram. "I've been bullied in my home for so long now ... ITS ENOUGH!" She later added that the knives were props.
So Unfair
In perhaps the most perfect nepo baby behavior of all time, Romy Mars, the teenage daughter of the director Sofia Coppola and the singer Thomas Mars, was grounded for (wait for it) trying to charter a helicopter from New York to Maryland using her father's credit card. "I wanted to have dinner with my camp friend." Ms. Mars said in a TikTok. She added that her parents had rules against her using social media.
The Streamable
A Woman of the People
In a scene from "Beckham," the Netflix documentary series about David Beckham, his wife, Victoria Beckham, is seen telling the camera that she grew up "very working class." At that moment, her husband pokes his head into the room to ask what kind of car her father drove her to school in. The former Spice Girl tries to duck the question before finally answering, "In the '80s, my dad had a Rolls-Royce." After the clip went viral, Ms. Beckham embraced it, posting it on her own TikTok account.
Feud? What Feud?
The "Sex and the City" cast member Kim Cattrall made a brief cameo in season two of the show's reboot, "And Just Like That ..." She was not in the same frame as any of the other members of the famous foursome, and if you blinked you'd have missed her. But, still, there she was. Our Samantha. Her minutes-long appearance inspired so many memes, tweets and TikToks you might have thought she was there all along.
The Debatable
Ozempic Mania
Weight loss drugs made their way to the online set this year, with some influencers casting stigma aside and unabashedly proclaiming their Ozempic use.
Djerf Dupe Drama
Matilda Djerf, a popular Swedish influencer and a founder of the fashion brand Djerf Avenue, irked fans when her team started reporting TikTok videos that mentioned places to purchase dupes -- inexpensive copies -- of her pricey designs.
Rocky Hockey Romance
Drama rippled through a niche literary community -- fans of hockey romance novels -- when Felicia Wennberg, the wife of the N.H.L. player Alex Wennberg, said that certain book lovers had become "predatory and exploiting" in their comments about her husband.
Bud Light Backlash
In April, the transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney partnered with Bud Light for a video promoting the brand. The online ad featuring Ms. Mulvaney angered many conservatives, who called for a boycott. As sales of the beer plunged, the musician Kid Rock posted a video that showed him shooting a stack of Bud Light cases. Months later, TMZ posted a video of him drinking the very same beer at a concert.
Taylor Made Travis Famous. Right?
The football star Travis Kelce was already a household name before he was romantically linked to one of the most famous women on the planet. This fall, as a prank, many women filmed themselves telling men -- usually husbands or boyfriends -- that Ms. Swift was going to put Mr. Kelce on the map. Based on the videos, it seems like every guy took the bait.
Arielle Chapin, Nancy Coleman, Anna Foley, Jessica Grose, Becky Hughes, Natasha Janardan, Joumana Khatib, Ran Lee, Phoebe Lett, Lauren McCarthy, Jordyn Holman, Callie Holtermann, Tanya Sichynsky, Dodai Stewart, Remy Tumin and Lindsey Wiebe contributed reporting.

Some internet users were amused, and others were horrified, by its kooky music video and baffling lyrics (“Women are my favorite guy”). Shoutout to DJ Crazy Times, aka Kyle Gordon, a comedian in New York City. In a similar vein, DJ Mandy, a 19-year-old student in California, made ripples this year as the Internet’s most inept disc jockey. Social media users couldn’t resist sharing videos that showed her making awkward mash-ups and beat drops, complete with a nonsensical transition from Flo Rida to Taylor Swift.
The Quiet Game
“Look around, everybody on mute,” Beyoncé sang each night of her “Renaissance” tour. That line, from the song “Energy,” gave rise to a social media challenge wherein audiences competed to see which crowd could be the most hushed. If you couldn’t get tickets, the best seat in the house was a TikTok livestream.
THE NUPTIAL
Emily Getting Married
Emily Mariko burst onto the viral scene in 2021 thanks to her simple recipe for salmon leftovers. In June, her California wedding became the talk of TikTok. People couldn’t get enough of the details, from the brown bridesmaids dresses to Mariko’s many outfit changes. It is unclear if salmon was served.
Sofia, Also Getting Married
This “quiet luxury” ceremony was anything but quiet. Social media users could not stop talking about the wedding of Sofia Richie Grainge, the daughter of Lionel Richie, to Elliot Grainge, a music executive. The soft, subtle makeup! The looks! The slicked-back bun! The South of France backdrop! Months after the April event, TikTok creators were still borrowing from Richie Grainge’s wedding-day style.
TikTok’s Wedding Fail
Lunden Stallings and Olivia Bennett built a huge following on TikTok, partly because of their country-club fashion sense. And so their October ceremony was highly anticipated by fans, who dubbed it TikTok’s royal wedding. The excitement, however, was short-lived. Days after the event, old tweets resurfaced in which one of the brides had repeatedly used a racial slur. The couple issued an apology and added an “anti-racist resources” page to their website, but the damage was done.
There Goes the Groom
Jacob LaGrone and Madelaine Brockway, a wealthy young couple from Texas, caused an online stir thanks to their lavish wedding, a five-day affair that included stops at the Versailles, the Paris Opera house and a reception headlined by Adam Levine of Maroon 5. Brockway posted several wedding videos on TikTok, all of which went viral and caused commenters to ask, Who are these people? The videos were deleted a few days after the ceremony, when surprising facts emerged about the groom. Namely, that he had fired a gun at police officers from Westworth Village and Westover Hills, Texas, who were trying to serve him with an indictment in March. LaGrone is now facing a potential life sentence.
THE THEATRICAL
An Oily Fight
A niche drama in the world of olive oil startups went online in April. The CEO and co-founder of Graza logged on to LinkedIn — a site not known as a forum for beefs — to accuse another olive oil company of stealing his idea. The idea being a squeeze bottle.
Mascara Fraud?
Mikayla Nogueira, a beauty influencer known for her Boston accent, caused a bit of an online ruckus in January after posting an ad for L’Oreal Telescopic Life mascara. In the video, Nogueira appears to be wearing false eyelashes, rather than the product she was promoting. (Someone fibbed on the internet? For money? Say it ain’t so!)
To Catch a Tabi Thief
Alex Dougé, a social media coordinator in New York, met a man named Josh on Tinder and brought him back to her apartment. The next morning she discovered that her Tabi Mary-Janes, a pricey shoe from the brand Margiela, were missing. After Dougé recapped the saga on TikTok, internet sleuths quickly located the man. It turned out that he had indeed stolen the prize shoes — and given them to his girlfriend! Oh, the drama! Dougé eventually got her Tabis back, and social media welcomed a new addition to the roster of awful internet men.
Riverboat Brawl
A brawl on the Alabama riverfront made national news after a video of the incident went viral in August. The fight came about after five white boaters attacked a Black riverboat captain, who had instructed them to dock their pontoon elsewhere. A Black bystander joined the melee on the captain’s behalf, wielding a folding chair as a weapon. In the brawl’s aftermath, the humble folding chair became a symbol of resistance.
Viral Trial
Gwyneth Paltrow on trial for an accident on the slopes of the Deer Valley Resort in Utah was the internet gift that kept on giving. Social media platforms were blanketed with memes about the proceedings in March as jurors heard testimony on who was to blame for the collision — the Oscar-winning actress or the retired optometrist who had sued her for more than $300,000. Online highlights included Paltrow’s answer to the question of the “losses” she had suffered because of the incident. “Well,” she said, “we lost half a day of skiing.” The jury found her Gwynocent.
Apartment Madness
Emma Ganzarain, a resource management employee in Oslo, Norway, just wanted to share photos of her redecorated apartment with her TikTok followers. Before she moved in, she explained, her boyfriend had lived there by himself, and she believed that she had brought some order to the place. Outraged commenters did not agree, accusing Ganzarain of turning a homey apartment into a sad beige nightmare.
THE SARTORIAL
These Boots Were Not Made For Walking
Fashion or marketing ploy? Cartoonish red boots were the talk of TikTok for a moment in February. The bloated footwear was designed by MSCHF, a New York collective with a knack for designing clothes and household goods that send the internet into a frenzy.
Law Roach (Kinda) Retires
Law Roach, an award-winning stylist for celebrities including Anne Hathaway and Celine Dion, created some confusion among the more fashion-conscious quarters of social media in March, when he abruptly announced that he was retiring, only to walk days later alongside Naomi Campbell in a runway show. He later clarified that he was retiring only from styling.
The Bedbugs of Paris
What’s French for schadenfreude? Amid the glam of Paris Fashion Week, a story crawled into the headlines. Bedbugs! Everywhere! Videos on social media raised the alarm by showing the little creatures scampering through the Paris Métro.
Platform as Runway
Kristina Avakyan, a New York resident, gained popularity on TikTok for videos in which she modeled eccentric outfits on subway platforms. She faced criticism after an interview with The Cut, in which she said that people in Harlem and Queens don’t understand her fashion sense.
Endless AI Portraits
Throughout the year, AI generators spat out images of people looking like modified, slightly shinier versions of themselves (with, occasionally, an extra finger or two). The AI yearbook photo generator was particularly popular on Instagram. But viewers beware! Pope Francis was not papped walking around in a puffy white Balenciaga coat. That was just some fairly convincing AI art.
THE MOSTLY DELIGHTFUL
A Hairbrush Microphone Masterpiece
The Mattison twins, a pair of TikTok creators, performed a funny lip-sync cover of Lady A’s “Need You Now,” singing into a hair brush suspended from the ceiling. (This hairbrush mic is one of the comedy duo’s go-to props.) The low-quality video, posted in February, recalled the simpler comedy of the Vine era (2013-17, RIP).
Dances With Knives
An Instagram video of Britney Spears dancing in her home wielding two large knives grabbed the attention of viewers in September. Some concerned fans reported the video to the police, to Spears’ chagrin. “So unacceptable for cops to listen to random fans and come in to my home unwarranted,” she wrote on Instagram. “I’ve been bullied in my home for so long now … ITS ENOUGH!” She later added that the knives were props.
So Unfair
In perhaps the most perfect nepo baby behavior of all time, Romy Mars, the teenage daughter of director Sofia Coppola and singer Thomas Mars, was grounded for (wait for it) trying to charter a helicopter from New York to Maryland using her father’s credit card. “I wanted to have dinner with my camp friend,” Romy Mars said in a TikTok. She added that her parents had rules against her using social media.
THE STREAMABLE
A Woman of the People
In a scene from “Beckham,” the Netflix documentary series about David Beckham, his wife, Victoria Beckham, is seen telling the camera that she grew up “very working class.” At that moment, her husband pokes his head into the room to ask what kind of car her father drove her to school in. The former Spice Girl tries to duck the question before finally answering, “In the ’80s, my dad had a Rolls-Royce.” After the clip went viral, Beckham embraced it, posting it on her own TikTok account.
Feud? What Feud?
“Sex and the City” cast member Kim Cattrall made a brief cameo in season two of the show’s reboot, “And Just Like That …”. She was not in the same frame as any of the other members of the famous foursome, and if you blinked you’d have missed her. But, still, there she was. Our Samantha. Her minutes-long appearance inspired so many memes, tweets and TikToks you might have thought she was there all along.
THE DEBATABLE
Ozempic Mania
Weight loss drugs made their way to the online set this year, with some influencers casting stigma aside and unabashedly proclaiming their Ozempic use.
Djerf Dupe Drama
Matilda Djerf, a popular Swedish influencer and a founder of the fashion brand Djerf Avenue, irked fans when her team started reporting TikTok videos that mentioned places to purchase dupes — inexpensive copies — of her pricey designs.
Rocky Hockey Romance
Drama rippled through a niche literary community — fans of hockey romance novels — when Felicia Wennberg, the wife of NHL player Alex Wennberg, said that certain book lovers had become “predatory and exploiting” in their comments about her husband.
Bud Light Backlash
In April, transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney partnered with Bud Light for a video promoting the brand. The online ad featuring Mulvaney angered many conservatives, who called for a boycott. As sales of the beer plunged, musician Kid Rock posted a video that showed him shooting a stack of Bud Light cases. Months later, TMZ posted a video of him drinking the very same beer at a concert.
Taylor Made Travis Famous. Right?
Football star Travis Kelce was already a household name before he was romantically linked to one of the most famous women on the planet. This fall, as a prank, many women filmed themselves telling men — usually husbands or boyfriends — that Swift was going to put Kelce on the map. Based on the videos, it seems like every guy took the bait.

Tighter Tax Credits May Hurt Electric Vehicle Sales: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Purchases of popular models like the Tesla Model 3 and the Ford Mustang Mach-E may no longer entitle buyers to tax savings because the cars do not meet tougher sourcing requirements.
Efforts to fight global warming could suffer a setback next year when new rules reduce the number of electric cars that qualify for a federal tax credit.
The credits, up to $ 7,500 a vehicle, have helped make electric cars more affordable, bringing the cost of some models below $ 30,000. Next year, for the first time, dealers will be able to give buyers the credit when they purchase a car, rather than telling them to claim it on their tax returns.
But qualifying for the subsidy will become more difficult on Jan. 1 because of Biden administration rules intended to encourage automakers to manufacture vehicles and parts in North America, while bypassing China. Most automakers are still years away from breaking their dependence on China for batteries and essential materials like refined lithium.
The stricter rules, which stem from the Inflation Reduction Act, throw up another impediment to electric vehicles. Sales of such cars and trucks are already growing less briskly than a year ago because of high interest rates and drivers' anxiety about finding charging stations.
Electric vehicles are still the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry, and Americans have already bought more than one million this year. Sales will rise another 32 percent in 2024, according to BloombergNEF, compared to 47 percent in 2023. But Ford Motor, General Motors and Tesla have slowed investment as the pace of growth has cooled.
The list of fully electric vehicles that qualify for tax credits was already limited. Under rules that took effect this year, the credit was available only to cars manufactured in North America.
To collect the full credit, carmakers also must meet quotas on how much of their battery components and certain raw materials come from the United States or trade allies. Tesla, General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Rivian and Nissan are the only companies offering electric cars that qualify for the at least a partial credit. Some plug-in hybrid cars from Audi, BMW, Chrysler, Jeep and Lincoln also qualify for tax breaks.
New rules kicking in on Jan. 1 add another set of restrictions, disqualifying vehicles containing components made in China or made elsewhere by a firm under the control of the Chinese government.
"If it was already confusing for consumers, it gets even more confusing," said Kevin Roberts, director of industry insights and analytics at CarGurus, an online marketplace.
Tesla, which accounts for half of all the electric vehicles sold in the United States, has warned on its website that the least expensive Model 3 sedan and a long-range version will no longer qualify after Dec. 31. The cars have a battery made in China. The existing credits lowered the price of the base Model 3 to around $ 30,000, on a par with similarly equipped gasoline cars like the Toyota Camry or Honda Accord.
The stricter rules will also disqualify Ford's Mustang Mach-E, which has been eligible for half the credit and was the fourth-most-popular U.S. electric vehicle this year. Ford is still figuring out whether the F-150 Lighting, an electric pickup, will be eligible, a spokesman said.
The rules are complex and could still be modified by administration officials, leading to confusion among industry executives. In the worst case, only a handful of vehicles will qualify.
Volkswagen said it is "cautiously optimistic" that its ID.4 electric sport utility vehicle, made in Chattanooga, Tenn., will continue to get the credit.
General Motors said it is assessing whether its electric lineup, which includes the Chevrolet Bolt and an electric version of the Silverado pickup, will qualify. Nissan, whose electric Leaf is eligible for half of the $ 7,500 credit, did not respond to a request for comment. Rivian, whose electric pickups and S.U.V.s have qualified, also did not respond.
There is another way drivers can benefit from the credit. Under an exception intended for businesses with vehicle fleets, the Inflation Reduction Act allows dealers to apply the subsidy to leased vehicles and pass it on to customers. That wrinkle has helped Hyundai and other foreign automakers remain competitive even though they do not produce electric vehicles and batteries in the United States.
More than 40 percent of Hyundai's electric vehicle sales are leases, a spokesman said, up from just 5 percent before new restrictions took effect this year. The same provision in the law has allowed people who lease cars made abroad by Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volvo and Polestar to receive the credit indirectly.
But leasing is not a panacea. Many people prefer to own their cars, and foreign automakers are sore that they have been excluded from the subsidy available to buyers. The electric vehicle credit "is overly complex and unfortunately creating customer and dealer confusion," Volvo Cars said in a statement.
But the lawmakers who drafted and passed the Inflation Reduction Act have said they wrote it to force carmakers to realign their supply chains. That is happening, but the changes will take some time to bear fruit.
The list of eligible vehicles could grow over the course of 2024 as carmakers ramp up U.S. production to qualify for the credits and other subsidies.
The Korean automaker Kia expects to begin producing the EV9, a seven-passenger electric sport utility vehicle, at a factory in Georgia next year. Those domestically assembled vehicles should be eligible for half the credit, or $ 3,750, a Kia spokesman said.
Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, Dodge, Ram and Jeep, plans to introduce six mass-market electric vehicles in 2024, including versions of the Dodge Charger, Jeep Wagoneer and Ram pickup. The company has not said whether the vehicles will qualify for credits.
Some hybrids, which have internal combustion engines and electric motors, will also qualify if they meet the sourcing requirements and have a battery with a capacity of at least seven kilowatt-hours.
The Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid will most likely still be eligible for a $ 7,500 credit, a company spokesman said, while buyers of the Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe and Jeep Wrangler 4xe hybrids are expected to be eligible for up to $ 3,750.
Market forces are pushing down the prices of electric vehicles, a trend that is expected to continue as carmakers increase production. The average list price of an electric vehicle fell to $ 63,000 in November from $ 68,000 a year earlier, according to CarGurus. The average list price of a vehicle with an internal combustion engine was $ 48,000, the same as in the previous year.
Federal subsidies and loans for battery factories and electric car plants are also helping to lower prices. At some point during the next several years, analysts expect electric vehicles to become less expensive than internal combustion models even without tax credits.
"The long-term trend is going to be one of reducing prices," Mr. Roberts of CarGurus said. "You are going to see more mainstream vehicles."

Gift Shopping With Chatbots: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: With Shopify, Mercari and other retailers rolling out chatbots to help buyers, this holiday shopping season is the first to be powered by A.I.
To help with my holiday shopping this year, I recently turned to a new personal assistant online. "I'm looking for a Christmas present for my mother, who spends long hours working," I typed. "Is there something she can use in her office every day?"
"Of course!" came the instant reply. "Does your mother have any specific preferences or needs for her office? For example, does she need organization tools, desk accessories, or something to help her relax during breaks?"
So began my conversation with Shop A.I., a new chatbot from Shopify, an e-commerce marketplace. Over 10 minutes, Shop A.I. and I engaged in a question-and-answer session. I told the chatbot my budget and more about my mother, such as her need to alleviate back pain. Shop A.I. also asked me about my mother's preferred design and color for an office chair.
More people may eventually replicate this kind of shopping experience. A year after ChatGPT debuted, retailers around the world have started rolling out chatbots that are powered by generative artificial intelligence. That makes this holiday season the first when a slew of A.I. chatbots can help shoppers brainstorm and find presents for their friends and loved ones.
In addition to Shopify, chatbots have come out over the past 12 months from Instacart, the delivery company; Mercari, a resale platform; Carrefour, a retailer; and Kering, which owns Gucci and Balenciaga. Walmart, Mastercard and Signet Jewelers are also testing chatbots, which may become publicly available as soon as next year.
"In a way, it's recreating an in-store environment, but online," said Carl Rivera, a vice president at Shopify who oversees its Shop app, which hosts Shop A.I. He said the chatbot broke down people's questions into key terms and searched relevant products from Shopify's millions of sellers. It then recommends products based on reviews and a shopper's purchase history.
Retailers have long used chatbots, but previous versions lacked conversational power and typically answered just a few preset questions, such as the status of an order. The newest chatbots, by contrast, can process prompts and generate tailored answers, both of which create a more "personalized and authentic interaction," said Jen Jones, the chief marketing officer of the platform Commercetools.
Whether shoppers want this technology remains a question. "Consumers like simplicity, so they don't necessarily want to have five different generative A.I. tools that they would use for different purposes," said Olivier Toubia, a marketing professor at Columbia Business School.
Nicola Conway, a lawyer in London, tried Kering's luxury personal shopper, Madeline, in August to search for a pink bridesmaid dress for a spring wedding. Madeline was "intuitive and novel," she said, but it gave only one recommendation, an Alexander McQueen corset dress. Ms. Conway did not end up buying it.
Kering did not respond to requests for comment.
Maggie Weber, a shopping influencer who uses the social media handle @refashionedhippie, said she tried Mercari's chatbot, Merchat A.I., in May. She asked the chatbot to show her baseball cards, but she was instead offered baseballs -- and then hats, bats and jerseys.
"Merchat is still in its infancy," Ms. Weber, 34, said. She added that she worried that if she gave the chatbot too much information, it would start directing personalized ads to her.
A Mercari spokeswoman said Merchat used chat history only to recommend products and did not use personally identifiable information. She added that the search bar could be faster for customers who want a specific item, while the chatbot helped those who want "inspiration for gifts."
Such inspiration was exactly what I needed this season as I had only vague ideas for what to buy my 53-year-old mother and my 17-year-old cousin, Jenny.
So I tried Shop A.I. After telling the chatbot about my mother's back pain and asking what I could buy to help her relax, Shop A.I. offered to find an ergonomic chair and asked my budget. When I said $ 100, it came back with a few pages of product results.
"Can you help me to narrow it down?" I typed. Shop A.I. then asked about my preferred color for a chair. I said black.
Shop A.I. returned more than 300 results, including a $ 159 camp chair from ROAM Adventure, a $ 179.99 reclining massage office chair from homrest and a $ 269.99 CosyGaming executive chair.
"These don't seem to be under $ 100," I wrote, annoyed.
"As a new chatbot, I'm still learning and sometimes the search results may not be accurate," Shop A.I. replied. "Let me try again and find some black ergonomic chairs within your budget."
Then, it added, "It seems that I'm having trouble finding black ergonomic chairs within your budget at the moment."
I ended up typing "black ergonomic chair" into the search bar myself and set a $ 100 price range. A $ 66.81 Victory Furniture gaming chair and a $ 47.96 massage office chair popped up, though they were too big and heavy to be gifts.
Eventually, I asked Shop A.I. for alternative ideas and received five options, including seat cushions and standing desk converters.
I chose the standing desk converter and gave Shop A.I. my $ 100 budget. This time, the chatbot showed options within my price range, including a $ 99 Risedesk standing desk converter. But most of the products did not have reviews, which I rely on while shopping online. I didn't buy anything.
Shop A.I. was not great at finding a gift for my cousin, either. I wanted to buy Jenny some college dorm decorations featuring her favorite anime series, Violet Evergarden, which follows a character named Violet as she recovers from an unidentified war.
But Shop A.I. appeared to decide that anything the color violet was connected to my query. It showed me wall art of purple mountains and posters of purple BMW cars.
So I turned to Mercari's Merchat. After asking for my cousin's hobby (anime), age (17) and what she might prefer for college (dorm decorations), Merchat offered three gift ideas: wall tapestries, string lights and desk accessories in the theme of Violet Evergarden.
Merchat showed me four products under each category, all of which were under my budget of $ 50. I ended up buying an $ 18 Violet Evergarden poster scroll for Jenny. (She later told me she wished I had gotten her something quirkier.)
Emboldened by the experience, I asked Merchat to help find a present for my mother. "Would she benefit from a back support cushion, a heating pad or maybe a massage chair pad?" it asked.
"What are the pros and cons of each?" I typed.
Merchat said it couldn't provide specific pros and cons for individual items. I changed my question to: "Which one is the easiest to use?"
This time, Merchat was definitive: the back support cushion, which was portable. Merchat detailed the differences between a memory-foam cushion and a firmer one, then further grouped memory-foam cushions into three categories and displayed the top four results for each, all under $ 100.
While I didn't buy any because the styles were limited, it was a great starting point.
"Thank you," I wrote.
"You're welcome!" Merchat replied. "Happy shopping and have a wonderful time with your family!"

Fewer Electric Vehicles Will Qualify for Federal Tax Credits in 2024

Efforts to fight global warming could suffer a setback next year when new rules reduce the number of electric cars that qualify for a federal tax credit.
The credits, up to $7,500 a vehicle, have helped make electric cars more affordable, bringing the cost of some models below $30,000. Next year, for the first time, dealers will be able to give buyers the credit when they purchase a car, rather than telling them to claim it on their tax returns.
But qualifying for the subsidy will become more difficult on Jan. 1 because of Biden administration rules intended to encourage automakers to manufacture vehicles and parts in North America, while bypassing China. Most automakers are still years away from breaking their dependence on China for batteries and essential materials like refined lithium.
The stricter rules, which stem from the Inflation Reduction Act, throw up another impediment to electric vehicles. Sales of such cars and trucks are growing less briskly than a year ago because of high interest rates and drivers’ anxiety about finding charging stations.
Electric vehicles are still the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry, and Americans have bought more than 1 million this year. Sales will rise another 32% in 2024, according to BloombergNEF, compared with 47% in 2023. But Ford Motor, General Motors and Tesla have slowed investment as the pace of growth has cooled.
The list of fully electric vehicles that qualify for tax credits was already limited. Under rules that took effect this year, the credit was available only to cars manufactured in North America.
To collect the full credit, carmakers also must meet quotas on how much of their battery components and certain raw materials come from the United States or trade allies. Tesla, General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Rivian and Nissan are the only companies offering electric cars that qualify for at least a partial credit. Some plug-in hybrid cars from Audi, BMW, Chrysler, Jeep and Lincoln also qualify for tax breaks.
New rules kicking in Jan. 1 add another set of restrictions, disqualifying vehicles containing components made in China or made elsewhere by a firm under the control of the Chinese government.
“If it was already confusing for consumers, it gets even more confusing,” said Kevin Roberts, director of industry insights and analytics at CarGurus, an online marketplace.
Tesla, which accounts for half of all the electric vehicles sold in the United States, has warned on its website that the least expensive Model 3 sedan and a long-range version will no longer qualify after Dec. 31. The cars have a battery made in China. The existing credits lowered the price of the base Model 3 to around $30,000, on a par with similarly equipped gasoline cars including Toyota Camry or Honda Accord.
The stricter rules will also disqualify Ford’s Mustang Mach-E, which has been eligible for half the credit and was the fourth-most-popular U.S. electric vehicle this year. Ford is still figuring out whether the F-150 Lighting, an electric pickup, will be eligible, a spokesperson said.
The rules are complex and could still be modified by administration officials, leading to confusion among industry executives. In the worst case, only a handful of vehicles will qualify.
Volkswagen said it is “cautiously optimistic” that its ID.4 electric sport utility vehicle, made in Chattanooga, Tennessee, will continue to get the credit.
General Motors said it is assessing whether its electric lineup, which includes the Chevrolet Bolt and an electric version of the Silverado pickup, will qualify. Nissan, whose electric Leaf is eligible for half of the $7,500 credit, did not respond to a request for comment. Rivian, whose electric pickups and SUVs have qualified, also did not respond.
There is another way drivers can benefit from the credit. Under an exception intended for businesses with vehicle fleets, the Inflation Reduction Act allows dealers to apply the subsidy to leased vehicles and pass it on to customers. That wrinkle has helped Hyundai and other foreign automakers remain competitive even though they do not produce electric vehicles and batteries in the United States.
More than 40% of Hyundai’s electric vehicle sales are leases, a spokesperson said, up from just 5% before new restrictions took effect this year. The same provision in the law has allowed people who lease cars made abroad by Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volvo and Polestar to receive the credit indirectly.
But leasing is not a panacea. Many people prefer to own their cars, and foreign automakers are sore that they have been excluded from the subsidy available to buyers. The electric vehicle credit “is overly complex and unfortunately creating customer and dealer confusion,” Volvo Cars said in a statement.
But the lawmakers who drafted and passed the Inflation Reduction Act have said they wrote it to force carmakers to realign their supply chains. That is happening, but the changes will take some time to bear fruit.
The list of eligible vehicles could grow over the course of 2024 as carmakers ramp up U.S. production to qualify for the credits and other subsidies.
Korean automaker Kia expects to begin producing the EV9, a seven-passenger electric sport utility vehicle, at a factory in Georgia next year. Those domestically assembled vehicles should be eligible for half the credit, or $3,750, a Kia spokesperson said.
Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, Dodge, Ram and Jeep, plans to introduce six mass-market electric vehicles in 2024, including versions of the Dodge Charger, Jeep Wagoneer and Ram pickup. The company has not said whether the vehicles will qualify for credits.
Some hybrids, which have internal combustion engines and electric motors, will also qualify if they meet the sourcing requirements and have a battery with a capacity of at least 7 kilowatt-hours.
The Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid will most likely still be eligible for a $7,500 credit, a company spokesperson said, while buyers of the Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe and Jeep Wrangler 4xe hybrids are expected to be eligible for up to $3,750.
Market forces are pushing down the prices of electric vehicles, a trend that is expected to continue as carmakers increase production. The average list price of an electric vehicle fell to $63,000 in November from $68,000 a year earlier, according to CarGurus. The average list price of a vehicle with an internal combustion engine was $48,000, the same as in the previous year.
Federal subsidies and loans for battery factories and electric car plants are also helping to lower prices. At some point during the next several years, analysts expect electric vehicles to become less expensive than internal combustion models even without tax credits.
“The long-term trend is going to be one of reducing prices,” Roberts of CarGurus said. “You are going to see more mainstream vehicles.”

My Not-So-Perfect Holiday Shopping Excursion With AI Chatbots

SAN FRANCISCO — To help with my holiday shopping this year, I recently turned to a new personal assistant online. “I’m looking for a Christmas present for my mother, who spends long hours working,” I typed. “Is there something she can use in her office every day?”
“Of course!” came the instant reply. “Does your mother have any specific preferences or needs for her office? For example, does she need organization tools, desk accessories, or something to help her relax during breaks?”
So began my conversation with Shop AI, a new chatbot from Shopify, an e-commerce marketplace. Over 10 minutes, Shop AI and I engaged in a question-and-answer session. I told the chatbot my budget and more about my mother, such as her need to alleviate back pain. Shop AI also asked me about my mother’s preferred design and color for an office chair.
More people may eventually replicate this kind of shopping experience. A year after ChatGPT debuted, retailers around the world have started rolling out chatbots that are powered by generative artificial intelligence. That makes this holiday season the first when a slew of AI chatbots can help shoppers brainstorm and find presents for their friends and loved ones.
In addition to Shopify, chatbots have come out over the past 12 months from Instacart, a delivery company; Mercari, a resale platform; Carrefour, a retailer; and Kering, which owns Gucci and Balenciaga. Walmart, Mastercard and Signet Jewelers are also testing chatbots, which may become publicly available as soon as next year.
“In a way, it’s re-creating an in-store environment, but online,” said Carl Rivera, a vice president at Shopify who oversees its Shop app, which hosts Shop AI. He said the chatbot broke down people’s questions into key terms and searched relevant products from Shopify’s millions of sellers. It then recommends products based on reviews and a shopper’s purchase history.
Retailers have long used chatbots, but previous versions lacked conversational power and typically answered just a few preset questions, such as the status of an order. The newest chatbots, by contrast, can process prompts and generate tailored answers, both of which create a more “personalized and authentic interaction,” said Jen Jones, the chief marketing officer of the platform Commercetools.
Whether shoppers want this technology remains a question. “Consumers like simplicity, so they don’t necessarily want to have five different generative AI tools that they would use for different purposes,” said Olivier Toubia, a marketing professor at Columbia Business School.
Nicola Conway, a lawyer in London, tried Kering’s luxury personal shopper, Madeline, in August to search for a pink bridesmaid dress for a spring wedding. Madeline was “intuitive and novel,” she said, but it gave only one recommendation, an Alexander McQueen corset dress. Conway did not end up buying it.
Kering did not respond to requests for comment.
Maggie Weber, a shopping influencer who uses the social media handle @refashionedhippie, said she tried Mercari’s chatbot, Merchat AI, in May. She asked the chatbot to show her baseball cards, but she was instead offered baseballs — and then hats, bats and jerseys.
“Merchat is still in its infancy,” said Weber, 34. She added that she worried that if she gave the chatbot too much information, it would start directing personalized ads to her.
A Mercari spokesperson said Merchat used chat history only to recommend products and did not use personally identifiable information. She added that the search bar could be faster for customers who want a specific item, while the chatbot helped those who want “inspiration for gifts.”
Such inspiration was exactly what I needed this season, as I had only vague ideas for what to buy my 53-year-old mother and my 17-year-old cousin, Jenny.
So I tried Shop AI. After telling the chatbot about my mother’s back pain and asking what I could buy to help her relax, Shop AI offered to find an ergonomic chair and asked my budget. When I said $100, it came back with a few pages of product results.
“Can you help me to narrow it down?” I typed. Shop AI then asked about my preferred color for a chair. I said black.
Shop AI returned more than 300 results, including a $159 camp chair from ROAM Adventure, a $179.99 reclining massage office chair from homrest and a $269.99 CosyGaming executive chair.
“These don’t seem to be under $100,” I wrote, annoyed.
“As a new chatbot, I’m still learning and sometimes the search results may not be accurate,” Shop AI replied. “Let me try again and find some black ergonomic chairs within your budget.”
Then, it added, “It seems that I’m having trouble finding black ergonomic chairs within your budget at the moment.”
I ended up typing “black ergonomic chair” into the search bar myself and set a $100 price range. A $66.81 Victory Furniture gaming chair and a $47.96 massage office chair popped up, although they were too big and heavy to be gifts.
Eventually, I asked Shop AI for alternative ideas and received five options, including seat cushions and standing desk converters.
I chose the standing desk converter and gave Shop AI my $100 budget. This time, the chatbot showed options within my price range, including a $99 Risedesk standing desk converter. But most of the products did not have reviews, which I rely on while shopping online. I didn’t buy anything.
Shop AI was not great at finding a gift for my cousin, either. I wanted to buy Jenny some college dorm decorations featuring her favorite anime series, Violet Evergarden, which follows a character named Violet as she recovers from an unidentified war.
But Shop AI appeared to decide that anything the color violet was connected to my query. It showed me wall art of purple mountains and posters of purple BMW cars.
So I turned to Mercari’s Merchat. After asking for my cousin’s hobby (anime), age (17) and what she might prefer for college (dorm decorations), Merchat offered three gift ideas: wall tapestries, string lights and desk accessories in the theme of Violet Evergarden.
Merchat showed me four products under each category, all of which were under my budget of $50. I ended up buying a $18 Violet Evergarden poster scroll for Jenny. (She later told me she wished I had gotten her something quirkier.)
Emboldened by the experience, I asked Merchat to help find a present for my mother. “Would she benefit from a back support cushion, a heating pad or maybe a massage chair pad?” it asked.
“What are the pros and cons of each?” I typed.
Merchat said it couldn’t provide specific pros and cons for individual items. I changed my question to: “Which one is the easiest to use?”
This time, Merchat was definitive: the back support cushion, which was portable. Merchat detailed the differences between a memory foam cushion and a firmer one, then further grouped memory foam cushions into three categories and displayed the top four results for each, all under $100.
While I didn’t buy any because the styles were limited, it was a great starting point.
“Thank you,” I wrote.
“You’re welcome!” Merchat replied. “Happy shopping and have a wonderful time with your family!”

Chaos, Injustice and Joy: College Essays About Money: [Correction]

Full text: Some of the most basic questions about money are also central to figuring out what and who you want to be: What do I have, what do I want, how does that compare to others around me and how should I feel about it?
In The New York Times's 10th year of publishing teenagers' college application essays about money, work, social class and other related topics, all four writers grappled with these questions in their own ways.
How should I handle my parents making a drastic change in how they earn their living? What will I do to get money, and why? What can I learn from careful attention to physical money itself? And how should I best process the riches and poverty that coexist within feet of each other -- and of me?
None of the questions have easy answers, or correct ones, necessarily. But learning to ask the hard ones is a giant step toward understanding your place in the world.

When you meet new people, there are things you immediately know: their hair color, their height, their fashion sense. As for me, I also immediately know who they voted for, that they're a proud N.R.A. member, or that they support the "sanctity of life" and Southern "heritage."
That's because I work at my family's carwash, so naturally my first introduction to people is their bumper stickers.
I didn't always work at a carwash in the outwardly beautiful, but decidedly fraught, Columbia, Tenn. In fact, until I was 14 my father worked on Wall Street -- the New York one, not the Tennessee one boasting our county's only Chipotle.
But when my 40-year-old aunt died, my parents engaged in radical grieving methods: having complete midlife crises, leaving their stable jobs, moving us 950 miles away to Nashville and opening a carwash. As you can imagine, my parents' crises translated to an entirely new crisis for me. In Tennessee, it often feels as though I stick out like a blue crayon in a 125-pack of red crayons (with a sharpener attached).
When my family opened the carwash, we took "family owned and operated" to a new level. My dad traded in his khakis and button-down shirt for shorts and industrial work shirts with our logo on the pocket. My mom abandoned her past experience managing accounts with Cartoon Network and pivoted to making WindMaster signs telling people not to hit other people.
And me? I went from an eighth grader to an assistant manager.
I know things that virtually no other 17-year-olds know or want to know: how to grease equipment, the perfect mixture of chemicals to get algae off cement floors and the best way to dodge a car flying directly at you. I've also had the pleasure of being the on-duty manager when cars have crashed in our parking lot, leading to my trying to work a brand-new surveillance system while profusely apologizing to the police, who very obviously wished an adult was present.
There are, however, things that have happened at the carwash that are far from funny. As a female and a minor, customers have made comments and jokes when talking to me that have made me feel deeply uncomfortable, exposed and, most importantly, out of place.
It's hard to feel I belong in Tennessee, where we're on the news weekly for a new book ban, shooting or shutdown of a Pride festival. I'm entrenched in a place where so many interactions feel like a contradiction of everything I stand for. It's not easy to accept that our regulars -- the people I've grown to love who always bring me a caramel candy or a water or show me pictures of their kids -- don't believe in my right to reproductive health care. Some of them carry guns, and most of them are unvaccinated. They care about me, but they don't care about me.
And they're never going to truly know me, the me who marches in protests and works on political campaigns. Part of the reason for all those loud bumper stickers is that we live in a time of not only great division, but even greater hatred. I'll admit I'm no angel, but I truly believe that activism must come from a place of love. So I'm going to keep fighting for what I believe in, not in spite of but because of the people I disagree with.
Although the carwash regulars may not fight for my rights, I love them enough to fight for theirs. I'll fight for them to have free universal health care, for their kids' guaranteed school lunches and for a fairer economy.
I may be ready to leave Tennessee, but its future matters to me. So while I'm here, I'm going to try to change some minds, whether it's one door, one protest or one carwash at a time.

There it is. The little mutant, who is supposed to be immortal, lies still, right beneath our noses.
The sun pulsates down on our backs as midday approaches on a scalding day in San Diego. The cockroach lies still, sprawled across the floor with one of its six legs pointed in each direction. An assemblage has emerged around the dead invertebrate, as our posse quarrels about what we could do with this prospect.
"Bet you won't eat that cockroach right now," challenges one person.
"Ten bucks says I will!" I shout confidently.
The small crowd grows into a state of silence, as heads begin to turn toward the instigator, then back to me, anticipating a standoff.
I have always been the "Money Man," so being offered to eat a cockroach, or any other similar requests, in exchange for monetary value was a common occurrence. I cannot explain why $ 10 entices me to conquer obscure feats. I have had a fortunate childhood where my earned dollars would typically buy a Snickers bar for my enjoyment.
Oftentimes, I ask myself why these trivial challenges matter? My father's job requires him to live on the other side of the globe for six months each year. His absence in my life has left me with an insecurity that no money can buy.
From a young age, I had to learn to live without a father figure. Our trips to Mission Bay Park were always cut short when his next rotation came, leaving me to teach myself how important a spiral was when throwing a football.
As a child, I quickly learned not everyone lived a life like mine. Growing up, due to my father's job, we lived overseas, providing me firsthand lessons in the value of money. I have witnessed poverty at its worst. Living abroad opened my eyes to the sheer number of people who would consume a cockroach for an American $ 10 bill.
I watched children who were 5-years-old in China doing backbreaking work for their families, just to make ends meet. Or beggars lining the streets of Egypt as their prestigious neighbors parted the road in their gold-plated G-wagons, spending millions on parties and feasts rather than helping their predecessors. Or my own family members in Mexico, who begged us to bring back clean water jugs and books for them and their children.
I may be privileged, but I have seen every nook and cranny of what it takes to make it in life. So, when the opportunity comes to make an extra dollar, I understand its value and embrace it.
Maybe I am money-driven, because it is my everlasting belief that I have every reason to make it in life. I have witnessed people come from immense poverty. So, I have no excuse to not make it, because people around the globe, who have so much less than me, still manage to hustle their way to the top.
Maybe it is the belief that if I learned the value of a dollar at an early age, I would be able to help my many family members struggling on the other side of the border. Maybe that is why I took a job in construction, not because I needed the money, but because I understood its importance.
I hope attending college, something most of my family couldn't do, will allow me to both help provide for them financially and be present in their lives. My family taught me the importance of a dollar, no matter what, even if I had to become "Cockroach Guy." My value of money and understanding of its global meaning will hopefully help me succeed in the classroom and beyond.

I stepped out of the bank, my eyes tracking the silver- and copper-colored specks shimmering beneath the water of the fountain.
Reaching into my pocket, I watched a man fling a coin in anticipation of his wish coming true. I slid my fingers along the edges of my quarters, contemplating throwing one in myself. However, I couldn't toss away a potential winning lottery ticket that easily. I grasped the rolls of coins just tightly enough to leave slight imprints in my palm and headed for my car.
Once home, I commenced the familiar sorting process I performed with all the coins in my collection. I cracked open the rolls of quarters on my desk, inspecting the sides to see if any coins had silver cores. The tangy scent of copper swirled around my room as I separated the coins by date, looking online for possible prices and potential error coins -- coins with manufacturing flaws.
My eyes lit up. I'd found one: A 2005-P Minnesota quarter with a reverse double die, a duplication of design elements on the back.
I quickly positioned the coin into a small case, scribbled an estimated $ 60 value and carefully piled it in my wooden drawer with the other rare coins. Although it was just a bargain-basement case, it was far superior to the makeshift ripped paper and tape "cases" I had been using as a new collector.
I reached into the back of my drawer and picked up a 1981 Australian 20-cent piece, one of my first-ever foreign coins, and also my favorite. I turned to the reverse. Having lived in the United States all my life, it always fascinated me to see a platypus rather than the freedom bird staring back at me.
I spun the coin between my fingers while looking through the other quarters. It invariably reminded me that I was never this prudent with my money before; my coin collection was more of a monthly holiday, rather than a facet of everyday life.
My original connection with coins arose from my grandmother's many trips around the world. When she had come back from South Africa, she let me check out some coins and bills from the bottom of her purse. However, when I peered inside and saw one remaining coin that was the most vibrant gold color, my 8-year-old mind couldn't help but want to entertain myself with it.
The coin in question: An early 1960s 2 Rand, valued at well over $ 300. It felt like a small-scale quarter but had far more pronounced ridges along the edges and was significantly heavier.
I remember holding it in the palm of my hand; the peculiar heft felt as if it was going to push my arm down. It had a stunning image of an antelope on the reverse that apparently made me think it was actually an antelope.
I made the ingenious decision to have the "antelope" gallop on a railing over the steep embankments of Riverside Park. This was my very first experience blowing $ 300 in a day, and I didn't realize until years later what I'd lost.
After the antelope incident, I made sure to keep the rest of my coins safe and secure, leading to the development of my attentive sorting routine. I scanned all the remaining coins and double-checked to make sure I hadn't left any treasures behind, then scraped together the quarters and placed them back into rolls. I headed back to the bank to trade in the quarters for pennies so I could once again attempt to bolster my collection.
On the way out, I again saw multiple people tossing change into the fountain. But the smiles on their faces quickly turned to frowns, for I took off my shoes and, not wanting to let wishes go to waste, rolled up my pants and hopped in with a bucket.

Some of the most basic questions about money are also central to figuring out what and who you want to be: What do I have, what do I want, how does that compare to others around me and how should I feel about it?
In The New York Times’ 10th year of publishing teenagers’ college application essays about money, work, social class and other related topics, all four writers grappled with these questions in their own ways.
How should I handle my parents making a drastic change in how they earn their living? What will I do to get money, and why? What can I learn from careful attention to physical money itself? And how best to process the riches and poverty that coexist within feet of one another — and of me?
None of the questions have easy answers, or correct ones, necessarily. But learning to ask the hard ones is a giant step toward understanding your place in the world.

SYDNEY CARROLL
Franklin, Tennessee, Battle Ground Academy
When you meet new people, there are things you immediately know: their hair color, their height, their fashion sense. As for me, I also immediately know who they voted for, that they’re a proud NRA member, or that they support the “sanctity of life” and Southern “heritage.”
That’s because I work at my family’s car wash, so naturally my first introduction to people is their bumper stickers.
I didn’t always work at a car wash in the outwardly beautiful, but decidedly fraught, Columbia, Tennessee. In fact, until I was 14 my father worked on Wall Street (the New York one, not the Tennessee one boasting our county’s only Chipotle).
But when my 40-year-old aunt died, my parents engaged in radical grieving methods: having complete midlife crises, leaving their stable jobs, moving us 950 miles away to Nashville and opening a car wash. As you can imagine, my parents’ crises translated to an entirely new crisis for me. In Tennessee, it often feels as though I stick out like a blue crayon in a 125-pack of red crayons (with a sharpener attached).
When my family opened the car wash, we took “family owned and operated” to a new level. My dad traded in his khakis and button-down shirt for shorts and industrial work shirts with our logo on the pocket. My mom abandoned her past experience managing accounts with Cartoon Network and pivoted to making WindMaster signs telling people not to hit other people.
And me? I went from an eighth grader to an assistant manager.
I know things that virtually no other 17-year-olds know or want to know: how to grease equipment, the perfect mixture of chemicals to get algae off cement floors and the best way to dodge a car flying directly at you. I’ve also had the pleasure of being the on-duty manager when cars have crashed in our parking lot, leading to my trying to work a brand-new surveillance system while profusely apologizing to the police, who very obviously wished an adult was present.
There are, however, things that have happened at the car wash that are far from funny. As a female and a minor, customers have made comments and jokes when talking to me that have made me feel deeply uncomfortable, exposed, and most importantly, out of place.
It’s hard to feel I belong in Tennessee, where we’re on the news weekly for a new book ban, shooting, or shutdown of a Pride festival. I’m entrenched in a place where so many interactions feel like a contradiction of everything I stand for. It’s not easy to accept that our regulars — the people I’ve grown to love who always bring me a caramel candy or a water or show me pictures of their kids — don’t believe in my right to reproductive health care, some of them carry guns, and most of them are unvaccinated. They care about me, but they don’t care about me.
And they’re never going to truly know me, the me who marches in protests and works on political campaigns. Part of the reason for all those loud bumper stickers is that we live in a time of not only great division, but even greater hatred. I’ll admit I’m no angel, but I truly believe that activism must come from a place of love. So I’m going to keep fighting for what I believe in, not in spite of but because of the people I disagree with.
Although the car wash regulars may not fight for my rights, I love them enough to fight for theirs. I’ll fight for them to have free universal health care, for their kids’ guaranteed school lunches and for a fairer economy.
I may be ready to leave Tennessee, but its future matters to me. So while I’m here, I’m going to try to change some minds, whether it’s one door, one protest or one car wash at a time.

There it is. The little mutant, who is supposed to be immortal, lies still, right beneath our noses.
The sun pulsates down on our backs as midday approaches on a scalding day in San Diego. The arachnid lies still, sprawled across the floor with one of its six legs pointed in each direction. An assemblage has emerged around the dead invertebrate, as our posse quarrels about what we could do with this prospect.
“Bet you won’t eat that cockroach right now,” challenges one person.
“Ten bucks says I will!” I shout confidently.
The small crowd grows into a state of silence, as heads begin to turn toward the instigator, then back to me, anticipating a standoff.
I have always been the “Money Man,” so being offered to eat a cockroach, or any other similar requests, in exchange for monetary value was a common occurrence. I cannot explain why $10 entices me to conquer obscure feats. I have had a fortunate childhood where my earned dollars would typically buy a Snickers bar for my enjoyment.
Oftentimes, I ask myself why these trivial challenges matter? My father’s job requires him to live on the other side of the globe for six months each year. His absence in my life has left me with an insecurity that no money can buy.
From a young age, I had to learn to live without a father figure. Our trips to Mission Bay Park were always cut short when his next rotation came, leaving me to teach myself how important a spiral was when throwing a football.
As a child, I quickly learned not everyone lived a life like mine. Growing up, due to my father’s job, we lived overseas, providing me firsthand lessons in the value of money. I have witnessed poverty at its worst. Living abroad opened my eyes to the sheer number of people who would consume a cockroach for an American $10 bill.
I watched children who were 5 years old in China doing backbreaking work for their families, just to make ends meet. Or beggars lining the streets of Egypt as their prestigious neighbors parted the road in their gold-plated G-wagons, spending millions on parties and feasts rather than helping their predecessors. Or my own family members in Mexico, who begged us to bring back clean water jugs and books for them and their children.
I may be privileged, but I have seen every nook and cranny of what it takes to make it in life. So, when the opportunity comes to make an extra dollar, I understand its value and embrace it.
Maybe I am money-driven because it is my everlasting belief that I have every reason to make it in life. I have witnessed people come from immense poverty. So, I have no excuse to not make it because people around the globe, who have so much less than me, still manage to hustle their way to the top.
Maybe it is the belief that if I learned the value of a dollar at an early age, I would be able to help my many family members struggling on the other side of the border. Maybe that is why I took up a job in construction, not because I needed the money, but because I understood its importance.
I hope attending college, something most of my family couldn’t do, will allow me to both help provide for them financially and be present in their lives. My family taught me the importance of a dollar, no matter what, even if I had to become “Cockroach Guy.” My value of money and understanding of its global meaning will hopefully help me succeed in the classroom and beyond.

I stepped out of the bank, my eyes tracking the silver- and copper-colored specks shimmering beneath the water of the fountain.
Reaching into my pocket, I watched a man fling a coin in anticipation of his wish coming true. I slid my fingers along the edges of my quarters, contemplating throwing one in myself. However, I couldn’t toss away a potential winning lottery ticket that easily. I grasped the rolls of coins just tightly enough to leave slight imprints in my palm and headed for my car.
Once home, I commenced the familiar sorting process I performed with all the coins in my collection. I cracked open the rolls of quarters on my desk, inspecting the sides to see if any coins had silver cores. The tangy scent of copper swirled around my room as I separated the coins by date, looking online for possible prices and potential error coins — coins with manufacturing flaws.
My eyes lit up. I’d found one: A 2005-P Minnesota quarter with a reverse double die, a duplication of design elements on the back.
I quickly positioned the coin into a small case, scribbled an estimated $60 value and carefully piled it in my wooden drawer with the other rare coins. Although it was just a bargain-basement case, it was far superior to the makeshift ripped paper and tape “cases” I had been using as a new collector.
I reached into the back of my drawer and picked up a 1981 Australian 20-cent piece, one of my first-ever foreign coins, and also my favorite. I turned to the reverse. Having lived in the United States all my life, it always fascinated me to see a platypus rather than the freedom bird staring back at me.
I spun the coin between my fingers while looking through the other quarters. It invariably reminded me that I was never this prudent with my money before; my coin collection was more of a monthly holiday, rather than a facet of everyday life.
My original connection with coins arose from my grandmother’s many trips around the world. When she had come back from South Africa, she let me check out some coins and bills from the bottom of her purse. However, when I peered inside and saw one remaining coin that was the most vibrant gold color, my 8-year-old mind couldn’t help but want to entertain myself with it.
The coin in question: An early 1960s 2 Rand, valued at well over $300. It felt like a small-scale quarter, but had far more pronounced ridges along the edges and was significantly heavier.
I remember holding it in the palm of my hand; the peculiar heft felt like it was going to push my arm down. It had a stunning image of an antelope on the reverse that apparently made me think it was actually an antelope.
I made the ingenious decision to have the “antelope” gallop on a railing over the steep embankments of Riverside Park. This was my very first experience blowing $300 in a day, and I didn’t realize until years later what I’d lost.
After the antelope incident, I made sure to keep the rest of my coins safe and secure, leading to the development of my attentive sorting routine. I scanned all the remaining coins and double-checked to make sure I hadn’t left any treasures behind, then scraped together the quarters and placed them back into rolls. I headed back to the bank to trade in the quarters for pennies so I could once again attempt to bolster my collection.
On the way out, I again saw multiple people tossing change into the fountain. But the smiles on their faces quickly turned to frowns, for I took off my shoes and, not wanting to let wishes go to waste, rolled up my pants and hopped in with a bucket.

Full text: A week after declaring a drive to organize nonunion automakers, the United Automobile Workers union filed charges against three foreign manufacturers.
The United Automobile Workers union accused three foreign automakers on Monday of unfair labor practices, asserting that they had interfered with efforts by employees to build support for the union at U.S. plants.
The union said it had filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board contending that the automakers -- Honda, Hyundai and Volkswagen -- had tried to prevent workers from discussing U.A.W. representation at work and that the companies had discriminated against those who had done so.
The action came two weeks after the U.A.W. announced an effort to organize nonunion plants owned by 10 foreign-owned companies, along with the domestic manufacturers Tesla, Lucid and Rivian, which make electric vehicles. The union has tried unsuccessfully to unionize some of those companies' factories in recent years, but not simultaneously on such a wide scale.
The U.A.W. said Monday that hundreds of workers at Honda's plant in Greensburg, Ind., and at Hyundai's plant in Montgomery, Ala., and more than 1,000 workers at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., had signed cards expressing support for joining the union.
At Honda, the union said, workers "report being targeted and surveilled by management for pro-union activity," while at Hyundai, "management has unlawfully confiscated, destroyed, and prohibited pro-union materials in nonwork areas during nonwork times."
It said that Volkswagen "had harassed and threatened workers for talking about the union" and that it had "confiscated and destroyed pro-union materials in the break room," among other accusations.
In a statement, Volkswagen said that it took such accusations seriously and that it would investigate the matter. "Volkswagen respects our workers' right to determine who should represent their interests in the workplace," it said.
Honda said, "We have not and would not interfere with our associates' right to engage in activity supporting or opposing the U.A.W." Hyundai said that the union's depiction of the matter was not accurate and that its workers "may choose to join a union or not as is their legal right."
Shawn Fain, the U.A.W. president, lashed out at the three companies in a statement issued by the union. "These companies are breaking the law in an attempt to get autoworkers to sit down and shut up instead of fighting for their fair share," he said. "But these workers are showing management that they won't be intimidated out of their right to speak up and organize for a better life."
The U.A.W. is trying to organize foreign-owned plants after a six-week wave of strikes against the three Detroit automakers -- Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, which makes Jeep, Chrysler and other brands -- that resulted in contracts providing record wage increases and additional gains in benefits.
In addition to Honda, Hyundai and Volkswagen, the foreign companies that the U.A.W. said last week that it was targeting are Toyota, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru, Mazda and Volvo.
The new contracts at Ford, G.M. and Stellantis raise the top hourly wage to $ 40 at the end of the four-and-a-half-year term, from $ 32 previously. Hourly wages at the foreign automakers in the United States generally range from the high teens to the high 20s.
After the U.A.W. agreements with the Detroit automakers were reached this fall, Honda said it would provide raises of 11 percent next year, and Hyundai said it would increase pay 14 percent next year and 25 percent by 2028. Toyota also announced raises.

Pickup or Lunar Lander? Tesla's Cybertruck Arrives.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Two years behind schedule, the electric model has an unusual design that sets it apart from rival pickups, which could limit its sales.
Tesla began delivering its much delayed, highly anticipated Cybertruck pickup to customers on Thursday, entering one of the most lucrative but competitive segments of the auto industry.
With its stainless steel body and sharp angles, the Cybertruck is unlike pickups from Ford Motor, General Motors and Ram, which dominate the market. With a starting price of $ 100,000 for the top-of-the-line version, it is Tesla's first completely new passenger vehicle in more than three years but arrives long after other automakers began selling battery-powered pickups.
That has analysts asking just who will buy the Cybertruck. Will it steal customers from traditional automakers, appeal to a different crowd or become a costly flop? Tesla has said hundreds of thousands of people have placed $ 100 refundable deposits on Cybertrucks. But there is no guarantee those reservations will translate into sales.
"It does beg the question, what kind of customer is Tesla looking for?" said Ben Rose, president of Battle Road Research, a firm that tracks electric vehicle and technology companies, who expects Tesla shares to outperform the market. "It looks like something lowered from the lunar module to collect rocks on the moon."
During an event Thursday in Austin, Texas, where the truck will be built, Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, answered criticism that it was not a serious working vehicle. Videos showed the Cybertruck beating trucks from Ford and Rivian in a hauling contest, and being used to carry steel and pull machinery at a construction site.
"It's an incredibly useful truck. It's not just some grandstanding showpiece," Mr. Musk said, adding, "like me."
The quip was perhaps a reference to the firestorm he ignited Wednesday when he said that advertisers that have pulled advertising from X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter and which he owns, were attempting to "blackmail" him because he endorsed an antisemitic post. "Don't advertise," Mr. Musk said at the DealBook Summit in New York, addressing the brands. He used an expletive multiple times for emphasis.
First displayed publicly in 2019, the Cybertruck has suffered from production problems stemming from its odd design and the choice of stainless steel rather than the lighter steel or aluminum typically used in cars and trucks. Sales have been delayed by more than two years, and Mr. Musk has warned investors that the company may not be able to manufacture the truck in large numbers until 2025.
"There will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with Cybertruck and making the Cybertruck cash-flow positive," Mr. Musk said in October.
There is a lot at stake for the traditional carmakers, too. Americans buy 2.5 million pickups a year, and those sales are an important source of profits for Ford, G.M. and Stellantis, which owns Ram, Jeep and Chrysler. In the United States, pickups are often sold as luxury vehicles. Well-heeled Europeans or Asians tend to buy sedans and sport utility vehicles from Mercedes-Benz, BMW or Audi. Many affluent Americans buy Ford F-150s with 18-speaker sound systems and heated steering wheels.
Tesla said on its website that a two-wheel-drive version of the Cybertruck will sell for $ 61,000, but not be available until 2025. Versions that start at $ 80,000 and $ 100,000 will be available next year.
The first buyers are likely to be well-to-do technology savants and collectors, Mr. Rose said. The Cybertruck is unlikely to have as much appeal to corporate fleet operators like utilities or construction companies. Nor is the model likely to be affordable or practical for landscapers, drywall installers and other small-business owners.
That is a relief to the traditional carmakers. About one-fifth of the F-150s that Ford sells go to business or government customers. Ford's Pro division, which focuses on commercial customers, makes a lot more money as a percentage of its sales than the division that sells gasoline vehicles to individuals. (The division that sells electric vehicles to consumers lost money.)
Some businesses buy pickup trucks without cargo beds, instead installing specialized boxes or platforms suited to their needs. That will be impossible with the Cybertruck's one-piece body.
Even when businesses buy trucks with standard beds, they often add accessories like tool boxes or ladder racks that would not fit in the Cybertruck. (Most pickups from other manufacturers look and operate much the same so they can accommodate these add-ons.)
So far, sales of electric pickups and other vehicles to commercial customers have been modest. But Ford sees potential to dominate a fast-growing market where there won't be much competition from Tesla. Ford's E-Transit electric vans have 50 percent of their market in the United States and Europe, Ted Cannis, chief executive of Ford Pro, said in an interview. The electric version of the F-150, known as the Lightning, has almost no competition among commercial customers, he added.
Ford can earn additional revenue from business and government customers by selling them services like software that tracks the locations of their employees and creates efficient routes. Ford will also help customers set up charging stations for fleets of pickups and vans. "We have to make the transition as easy as possible," Mr. Cannis said.
There has been no indication that Tesla plans to provide similar services.
Marketing for the Cybertruck emphasizes its speed, comfort and toughness. Like Ford's F-150 Lightning, the Tesla pickup will come with power outlets for tools or appliances and can power a home temporarily during a blackout.
During the event Thursday, a video showed a man shooting bullets at a Cybertruck. "The apocalypse could come along at any moment," Mr. Musk quipped. "Here at Tesla we have the finest in apocalyptic technology."
Electric pickups have been available since late 2021, when Rivian, a young electric vehicle company, began selling the R1T. Ford began selling the F-150 Lightning in 2022. G.M. began selling an electric version of its Silverado pickup in limited numbers this year.
So far, the response from buyers has been mixed. Electric pickups accounted for only 3 percent of the electric vehicle market in the first nine months of 2023. And just 2 percent of all pickups sold in the United States were electric, according to estimates by Kelley Blue Book and Battle Road.
But sales are growing faster than the overall auto market even if the pace has slowed recently. F-150 Lightning sales in the first nine months of the year grew 40 percent to more than 12,000 vehicles, according to Kelley Blue Book. Sales of Rivian pickups grew 28 percent to more than 14,000 vehicles.

Tesla began delivering its much delayed, highly anticipated Cybertruck pickup to customers Thursday, entering one of the most lucrative but competitive segments of the auto industry.
With its stainless steel body and sharp angles, the Cybertruck is unlike pickups from Ford Motor, General Motors and Ram, which dominate the market. With a starting price of $100,000 for the top-of-the-line version, it is Tesla’s first completely new passenger vehicle in more than three years but arrives long after other automakers began selling battery-powered pickups.
That has analysts asking just who will buy the Cybertruck. Will it steal customers from traditional automakers, appeal to a different crowd or become a costly flop? Tesla has said hundreds of thousands of people have placed $100 refundable deposits on Cybertrucks. But there is no guarantee those reservations will translate into sales.
“It does beg the question, what kind of customer is Tesla looking for?” said Ben Rose, president of Battle Road Research, a firm that tracks electric vehicle and technology companies, who expects Tesla shares to outperform the market. “It looks like something lowered from the lunar module to collect rocks on the moon.”
During an event Thursday in Austin, Texas, where the truck will be built, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, answered criticism that it was not a serious working vehicle. Videos showed the Cybertruck beating trucks from Ford and Rivian in a hauling contest, and being used to carry steel and pull machinery at a construction site.
“It’s an incredibly useful truck. It’s not just some grandstanding showpiece,” Musk said, adding, “like me.”
The quip was perhaps a reference to the firestorm he ignited Wednesday when he said that advertisers that have pulled advertising from X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter and which he owns, were attempting to “blackmail” him because he endorsed an antisemitic post. “Don’t advertise,” Musk said at the DealBook Summit in New York, addressing the brands. He used an expletive multiple times for emphasis.
First displayed publicly in 2019, the Cybertruck has suffered from production problems stemming from its odd design and the choice of stainless steel rather than the lighter steel or aluminum typically used in cars and trucks. Sales have been delayed by more than two years, and Musk has warned investors that the company may not be able to manufacture the truck in large numbers until 2025.
“There will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with Cybertruck and making the Cybertruck cash-flow-positive,” Musk said in October.
There is a lot at stake for the traditional carmakers, too. Americans buy 2.5 million pickups a year, and those sales are an important source of profits for Ford, GM and Stellantis, which owns Ram, Jeep and Chrysler. In the United States, pickups are often sold as luxury vehicles. Well-heeled Europeans or Asians tend to buy sedans and SUVs from Mercedes-Benz, BMW or Audi. Many affluent Americans buy Ford F-150s with 18-speaker sound systems and heated steering wheels.
Tesla said on its website that a two-wheel-drive version of the Cybertruck will sell for $61,000, but not be available until 2025. Versions that start at $80,000 and $100,000 will be available next year.

U.A.W. Aims To Unionize More Plants: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The United Automobile Workers' effort, with a long-elusive goal, follows its success in securing big raises in contracts with the Detroit automakers.
The United Automobile Workers union announced Wednesday that it was undertaking an ambitious drive to organize plants owned by more than a dozen nonunion automakers, including Tesla and several foreign companies -- a goal that has long eluded it.
The move comes weeks after the U.A.W. won new contracts from General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis that included wage increases of 25 percent or more over four and a half years for its 146,000 members employed there.
In addition to Tesla, the targets of the drive are two other electric vehicle start-ups, Lucid and Rivian, and 10 foreign-owned automakers: Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru, Volkswagen, Mazda and Volvo.
The U.S. plants owned by those companies employ nearly 150,000 workers in 13 states, the union said.
If the organizing drive gains momentum, it could become one of the largest by the U.A.W. since its infancy in the 1930s. The union's past efforts to organize even single plants owned by the foreign automakers, concentrated in the South, came to nought. A foothold among those companies would signal a big shift in the American auto industry, where nonunion manufacturers have long had a significant cost advantage over the Detroit automakers.
The union said the organizing drive had been prompted by inquiries from several thousand workers at nonunion plants.
"Workers across the country, from the West to the Midwest and especially in the South, are reaching out to join our movement and to join the U.A.W.," the union's president, Shawn Fain, said in a video posted on Facebook. "The money is there. The time is right."
A Honda statement cited the automaker's "competitive wages and benefits," adding, "We do not believe an outside party would enhance the excellent employment experience of our associates." Hyundai referred to its "excellent wages and benefits," adding, "Our team members have not shown an interest in union representation." Subaru pointed to wage increases and its benefits package but did not comment directly on the union drive. Rivian and Volkswagen said they had no comment.
At the DealBook Summit conference sponsored by The New York Times on Wednesday, Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, said, "If Tesla gets unionized, it will be because we deserve it and we failed in some way." He reiterated his opposition to unions, saying that "it's not good to have an adversarial relationship" between groups within a company.
The other companies did not respond to requests for comment.
On Wednesday, the U.A.W. activated websites where workers can electronically sign cards that serve as an official certification of their desire to have union representation. Earlier, at a handful of plants, the U.A.W. had already received signed cards from more than 30 percent of the work force, the threshold required under federal law for the union to move forward with a vote on unionization, a person familiar with the matter said.
The union is now working to send organizers to areas around these nonunion plants to collaborate with workers at those factories, this person said.
After the U.A.W. reached agreements with the Detroit automakers to raise wages, Toyota, Honda and Hyundai announced that they, too, would increase workers' pay.
Toyota has told workers that it will raise hourly rates 9 percent in January. Honda will lift wages 11 percent and Hyundai 14 percent next year. Hyundai plans to increase wages 25 percent by 2028.
The U.A.W. said Wednesday that it was making a concerted effort to organize a large Toyota plant in Georgetown, Ky., that employs about 7,800 workers and produces the Camry sedan and RAV4 sport utility vehicle.
U.A.W. members have long earned more than nonunion workers. At plants in the South, wages tend to start below $ 20 an hour and top out at less than $ 30. The top U.A.W. hourly wage, previously $ 32, climbed to more than $ 40 in the contracts the union signed with the three Detroit manufacturers.
The U.A.W. has fallen short twice in the past decade -- by narrow margins, in 2014 and 2019 -- in unionization votes at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tenn. The U.A.W. lost by a substantial margin at a Nissan plant in Canton, Miss., in 2017. Organizing efforts at other companies' plants have petered out before coming to a vote.
But after Mr. Fain became the union's president this year, the union promised a more aggressive approach to its contract talks with the Big Three and vowed to renew efforts to widen its reach in the industry.
In addition to wage gains at the Detroit companies, the U.A.W. won agreements to preserve jobs and to keep open a Stellantis plant in Illinois that had been slated to close.
Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said the U.A.W.'s wage gains created a stronger case for joining the union.
"It shows collective bargaining works and shows the U.A.W. was successful," he said. "They can say: 'We saved this plant. Look at what we got. You can have this, too."'
Past organizing drives were hurt because the U.A.W. had a tarnished image, Mr. Wheaton added: Many unionized plants had closed, its members had been required to accept wage and benefit cuts to help the Detroit manufacturers survive the 2009 financial crisis, and federal corruption investigations had implicated senior union officials.
"A lot of the negative things about the union -- a lot of that stuff has gone away now," Mr. Wheaton said.

Consumer Confidence Up
For Holiday Shopping
After declining for three straight months, American consumer confidence ticked up in November as the all-important holiday shopping season kicked into high gear.
The Conference Board, a business research group, said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index rose to 102 this month from 99.1 in October. Analysts were expecting a reading of 101. The October reading was revised down from an original reading of 102.6.
The index measures both Americans' assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for the next six months.
The main index was boosted by respondents whose outlook for the next six months improved.
The index measuring Americans short-term expectations for income, business and job market rose to 77.8 in November from 72.7 in October. However, it was the third straight reading below 80 for future expectations, which historically signals a recession within a year. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Rolls-Royce Aims High
On Its Jet Engines
Rolls-Royce aims to quadruple profit in the next five years by boosting the performance of its jet engines and bearing down on costs in the chief executive's master plan for Britain's most prestigious engineering company.
Setting out a strategy that has been almost a year in the making, Tufan Erginbilgic, the C.E.O., said on Tuesday he would deliver up to 2.8 billion pounds ( $ 3.5 billion) in annual operating profit by 2027, four times 2022's outcome and double its guidance for up to 1.4 billion pounds this year.
That would be driven by surge in profit margins at its civil aerospace business to 15-17 percent from 2.5 percent last year.
Mr. Erginbilgic, a former BP executive who took over in January, said he would tackle Rolls-Royce's inefficiencies by focusing on the wide-body plane sector, where it is Airbus's exclusive supplier, business aviation, defense and power systems. REUTERS

Bank of America Is Fined On Loan Application Data
Bank of America agreed to pay a $ 12 million fine to settle U.S. regulatory charges it routinely submitted inaccurate information about mortgage applicants to the federal government, violating a law that thousands of mortgage lenders have followed for decades.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said on Tuesday that more than 400 loan officers at the bank failed to ask applicants required questions about their race, ethnicity and sex, and then falsely reported that the applicants chose not to respond.
Failing to accurately report demographic data violates the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, a 1975 law that helps regulators assess whether lenders are serving their communities' housing needs and not engaged in discriminatory lending, the bureau said.
Bank of America did not admit or deny wrongdoing in accepting the fine, which covered conduct between 2016 and 2021. REUTERS

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "Girls in the Windows" wasn't made by an art world giant, but people keep buying it. And buying it. And buying it.
Standing on a second-story fire escape, a photographer named Ormond Gigli is shouting instructions through a bullhorn. Forty models are posing in the window frames of brownstones across East 58th Street on Manhattan's Upper East Side, a menagerie of colorful dresses and evening gowns. Two more women stand on the sidewalk, next to a silver Rolls-Royce.
It is the summer of 1960 and Gigli is in a rush. Demolition on the brownstones has already begun -- that's why there's no glass in those windows -- and the day after the shoot, the buildings will be razed. But the demolition supervisor has agreed to let Gigli commandeer the place for two hours during an extended lunch break, under one condition: The supervisor wants his wife in the picture. (She's on the third floor, third from the left.)
Nobody has hired Gigli, a 35-year-old freelance commercial photographer, to create "Girls in the Windows." He's working without an assignment because he wants to memorialize those buildings, which stand directly across the street from his home studio. What he doesn't know is that the image will become one of the most collected photographs in the history of the medium.
Over the last 30 years, roughly 600 signed and numbered copies have been sold, at prices that typically range between $ 15,000 and $ 30,000. The image is offered at galleries around the world -- in New York, Los Angeles, Palm Beach, Cleveland, Atlanta, Boston, Santa Fe, London, Paris and, until the invasion of Ukraine, Moscow. Buyers who want to cut out the middleman can buy directly from the artist's estate.
"Girls in the Windows" is also a darling of the auction market. More than 160 have been offered over the years at Phillips, Christie's, Sotheby's and other houses, according to Artnet. In 2017 alone, an amazing 13 copies were put on the block and instead of depressing the prices, one of them set a record for the image, at $ 56,906. Seven have been sold at auctions this year, and on Tuesday another one sold at Phillips in London for 30,480 British pounds, roughly $ 38,000 and well over the high estimate.
The standard art market rules of supply and demand simply don't apply to "Girls in the Windows." Add up the prices of all the copies already sold and you end up with a number in the range of $ 12 million.
"We've had discussions about this internally," said Caroline Deck, senior specialist of photographs at Phillips in New York City. "It must be the highest-grossing photograph of all time."
It's hard to know for sure if that's true. A few photographs have turned up at auction more times than "Girls," including "Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico," a 1941 photograph by Ansel Adams, and Henri Cartier-Bresson's "Rue Mouffetard," a 1954 black-and-white image of a young boy proudly toting two bottles of wine down a street. And a number of individual photographs have fetched spectacular sums, including work by Man Ray ("Le Violon d'Ingres," which sold for $ 12.4 million) and Edward Steichen ("The Flatiron," $ 11.8 million).
But the notion that "Girls" might well belong in a discussion about the most valuable photographs in history raises a question: How did an otherwise obscure commercial photographer, who spent much of his career photographing celebrities and politicians for magazines like Parade and Life, crash a party filled with some of the most famous artists in the world?
The answer starts with the image, of course, which is a brassy, joyful combination of glamour and urban grit with a dash of "Mad Men"-era nostalgia. The building embodies a glorious slab of vanishing New York City, and those women look like they're ready to break into song.
"If you come to the gallery, we've got a lot of stuff hanging and that's the one they always stop in front of," said Etheleen Staley, co-founder of Staley-Wise, a gallery in SoHo, the first to sell a copy of "Girls." "They love it and they'll pay a lot of money for it and ignore that there are a million out there."
A "million" overstates the matter, but it hints at the other secret of the success of "Girls" -- a very robust supply. Starting around 2010, and before his death in 2019, Gigli produced, printed and signed hundreds of copies of the photograph, in a variety of sizes and on a variety of photographic papers. He did so at the behest of his son, Ogden, 63, a photographer who now runs his father's estate and who masterminded the unique sales strategy that turned the image into a phenomenon.
"It was all me, saying to my father, 'Whatever we do, whatever editions we make, I can sell them, don't worry,"' said the younger Gigli, from his studio in Pittsfield, Mass., home to what could be called Girls in the Windows Inc. "I saw that we needed to have inventory for the day my father passed and it was my belief that the appeal of this image would carry on forever."
Typically, fine art photographers sell five or six copies of an image in one or two sizes. Scarcity is intended to drive interest and sustain prices. "Girls" has been printed in 12 different sizes and in each size the Giglis created dozens of photographs. There are 75 copies of the 50-inch square edition, for instance, and 44 copies of the 27-inch square edition.
"The reason it's successful is that there is product for people to own," Ogden Gigli explained. "And they're not worried that there are hundreds out there. They're thinking that $ 10,000, $ 20,000, $ 30,000 isn't a lot for one of the world's best images."
Ormond Gigli grew up in New York City and took up photography in his teens. He joined the U.S. Navy during World War II, serving as a photographer, and later bought the brownstone -- still standing at 327 East 58th Street, now home to the permanent mission of the Kingdom of Cambodia to the United Nations -- where he set up his home studio. He took assignments from The Saturday Evening Post, Time and other magazines. John F. Kennedy stopped by the studio to have his portrait taken by Gigli in 1961. Boris Karloff arrived with a man dressed as Frankenstein. Gigli coaxed a mule onto the premises for a hillbilly-themed shot of the actress Gina Lollobrigida.
At some point in 1960, Gigli realized that a clutch of brownstones across the street were about to disappear. Manhattan was just entering its maximum-occupancy phase, obliterating tenements and constructing high-rise apartment buildings. The idea for "Girls" came to him close to the day of destruction.
"There was very little planning beforehand," said Sue Ellen Gigli, his wife, 95, who spoke on the phone from her son's studio. "But we knew those buildings were coming down so he thought about what he could do to remember them as they were."
Sue Ellen Gigli wasn't just an onlooker during the "Girls" shoot. She is standing in a window, second row, far right. She remembers a bit of a frenzy and a focus on costs. The 40 models came from an upstart agency, and none of them seemed to mind the pay -- $ 1 per woman for the whole gig. Nor did they flinch when asked to bring their own outfits, or do their own hair and make up.
The Rolls was borrowed from a dealership nearby. A small disaster was averted when a Con Edison crew agreed to pour concrete on a patch of sidewalk it had just dug up. The women stepped around debris to climb the tenement stairs and, from across the street, Ormond Gigli arranged them just so.
"I moved them around to spread out the colors," he told The Guardian in 2013, "and told them to pose as if they were giving someone a kiss."
The image first ran in Ladies' Home Journal, then a handful of other publications. It didn't become commercially available until 1994. That year, Sue Ellen Gigli called Sotheby's and asked if it would sell "Girls in the Windows." An in-house expert advised her to find a gallery that would represent her husband. The Giglis soon hopped on a subway to SoHo, a copy of "Girls" in hand.
"We took to it instantly," recalled Staley, the gallerist. "In the beginning it was just us. Now Ogden sells to whomever he wants."
Ogden Gigli keeps close tabs on his many sellers. If he learns that a gallery is peddling "Girls" at a discount, that gallery is cut off. And he provides copies to auction houses at a pace intended to maintain a base-line price. Which doesn't always work. Over the years, about 30 copies have failed to sell at their low estimates at auctions, Artnet reports. (The auction house will usually find a buyer privately, hold the image for a future auction or return it to Gigli.)
The vast majority, though, are gaveled out the door. Buyers rhapsodize about the image and are undaunted by the sheer quantity of "Girls" in the world.
"I didn't buy it to make money," said Jim Buslik, 73, a principal in the commercial real estate business in New York, who bought his copy in 2008. "It hit me the first time I saw it and every day after that."
Unsurprisingly, auction houses regularly contact Gigli and ask for a "Girls." That's what Phillips did a few weeks ago, requesting the copy that sold on Tuesday.
"Departments do have to hit their numbers," said Joshua Holdeman, head of the Hammond Group, an art advisory firm, who has worked at all three of the major auction houses. "And if they know it's an easy sale and it's going to sell at a certain price, it's like, totally easy money."
Gigli says he has about 100 "Girls" left, including black-and-white copies that he describes as so stunning he's a little reluctant to part with them. But he will, and once everything is sold, one of photography's most improbable runs will come to end.
Unless it doesn't. Some heirs of deceased artists produce "estate prints," which look identical and simply lack the artist's signature. (They get an estate stamp instead.) Estate prints of "Girls" would surely fetch lower prices, but how much lower is unclear.
"That's a market I need to research," Gigli said. "You never know."
Photograph Over the last 30 years, roughly 600 signed and numbered copies of Ormond Gigli's "Girls in the Windows" (top) have been sold, at prices that typically range between $ 15,000 and $ 30,000. More than 160 prints have been sold at auctions. The photographer, above, shot the piece without an assignment. His son, Ogden Gigli, above right, in his photo studio in Pittsfield, Mass., is the mastermind of the sales strategy for the work.

Nissan to Build 3 Electric Cars At Britain Plant: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company said it would build three electric models at its plant in northeast England, bolstering the future of Britain's auto industry.
Nissan said Friday that it would invest an additional 1.1 billion pounds (about $ 1.4 billion) to make three new electric models at its plant in Sunderland in northeast England.
The announcement, which included plans for an additional battery plant, appears to go a long way to ensure that a substantial auto manufacturing industry will continue in Britain in the coming decade or longer.
Until recently that wasn't assured. Brexit, which has made trade with the European Union more cumbersome, and the global shift to electric cars had raised fears that the British vehicle manufacturing industry faced an existential crisis. Britain's output of cars has fallen by around 50 percent over the last six years.
"I think it is a very significant investment," said Peter Wells, an automotive specialist at Cardiff Business School.
Besides the plan to make three electric models in Sunderland, Nissan said it would make its auto plant the anchor of a low-emissions industrial complex. The facilities would include a new plant to make electric car batteries as well as solar and wind farms to generate green electricity for the plants and a power system to link the facilities. The hope would be to attract additional suppliers, creating many more jobs.
The battery plant would join two others: one currently in operation, and another under development, both run by Envision AESC, a subsidiary of a Chinese company that partners with Nissan. Envision AESC is expected to build the third plant.
Mr. Wells said this idea of creating a green manufacturing hub in northeast England was the key to the announcement. As automakers' shift to lower emission vehicles, they will also want to cut the carbon footprint in their manufacturing, he said.
"This is the future of this kind of operation," Mr. Wells said. "The long game is to have zero-carbon manufacturing."
Nissan's Sunderland plant churned out 238,000 vehicles in 2022, more than any other assembly plant in Britain, although it previously produced half a million vehicles annually. The company announced it would make electric versions of two conventional models now produced there, the popular Qashqai and the Juke. Sunderland will also make the next generation of the Leaf, an electric model that has been made at the plant for a decade.
If successful, the plan could help protect the jobs of the 7,000 employees Nissan has in Britain. "Our U.K. team will be designing, engineering and manufacturing the vehicles of the future," Makoto Uchida, Nissan's president and chief executive, told workers at the Sunderland plant Friday, according to a company statement.
In recent months, auto manufacturers with substantial interests in Britain agreed to shore up the British industry. Tata, the Indian conglomerate that owns Jaguar Land Rover, previously announced an up to £4 billion investment in a large battery plant. And in September BMW said it would invest £600 million to build electric versions of its popular Mini car models in Britain.
At the same time, the British government of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has been pushed to provide aid to secure manufacturing jobs in industries like auto making and steel. On Wednesday, the government announced an additional £2 billion to support zero emissions car manufacturing as part of an overall statement on spending.
A spokesman for Nissan declined to disclose the amount of aid it would receive from the government, saying that discussions were still ongoing.

Crushing It: The Joy in the Chaos: [Style Desk]

Full text: The minivan life takes a turn when the kids are old enough to drive.
My life is pretty relaxing right now, but there's a chilling period each day that derails all of my sleekest and sturdiest emotional trains, and that's the dark corridor between 8:30 and 8:42 a.m., when my two daughters leave for high school.
I would offer you details -- sounds, mostly; terrifying sounds! -- but your delicate sensibilities might not tolerate such descriptions. If you're familiar with Shirley Jackson's oeuvre or you started to read Mark Danielewski's "House of Leaves" and then stopped because you couldn't handle it, you have some grasp of the possibilities.
My older daughter is now driving my younger daughter to school in our minivan. This feels like watching Toonces the Driving Cat take the car out for a spin with her little sister in the passenger seat. The minivan is very beat up, which my older daughter complained about ferociously, until she started contributing some dents and scrapes of her own.
I started the downward trend 10 years ago, when our van was savagely mauled by an invisible but vicious curb somewhere outside of Las Vegas. Since then, an entire side panel has sagged and sometimes dragged along the road, a compromise in aerodynamics and peace of mind that didn't even register back when we were stopping at gas stations every five minutes because someone small had to "go potty." The term "go potty" alone is enough to conjure that bright and jittery era when half of the words in our mouths were bequeathed to us by teachers and other parents determined to baby talk themselves straight into the bowels of hell.
But back then, it often felt as if our bodies and minds had been seized by cheerful demons from the bowels of hell, or maybe we had been abducted and forever changed by mischievous aliens from distant galaxies. Because as we wiped butts and filled sippy cups and sang about baby whales (a tune they are surely playing in hell as we speak), we always tried to keep everything peppy and light, loving and together-y, light and rhymey and not too grimy. We were not ourselves, in other words.
So of course we drove a crumpled minivan around town without shame. The aliens who controlled our brains didn't care about style or image. They were silly aliens (silly, another ubiquitous parenting term, that could signal either naughty or irrational). Those good-natured idiots from outer space just wanted us to squeeze some delight out of each and every calamity. Our lives alternated between panic and delight. We were never fully at rest, we were always on call, but it was somehow delightful anyway.
Onlookers sometimes believe that parents force a life of filth and chaos into a happy shape, just to avoid regretting their bad choices. This is an understandable take on human beings who are engaged in round-the-clock efforts to reshape green vegetables into tasty treats and recast scary unknowns as fun mysteries. One reviewer on Amazon complained that I was dishonest about parenting in my marriage memoir "Foreverland." I made it sound fun and that was obviously a gloss. Parenting is all chills and spills and torment. I was a liar.
It's really too bad comments on Amazon aren't carved in stone on cave walls, so generations to come can marvel over the fascinating emotional afflictions suffered by these mysterious ancient peoples. But mostly what I think when I read those comments -- or encounter yet another article about how parenting is an exhausting hellscape -- is that the chills and spills and torment of parenting are the fun.
Even hardship can be joyful, when you surrender to the chaos and marvel at the rustic redesign of your life at the hands of parenting. Even as you lose track of concepts like serenity and self-respect and human dignity, you gain a sense of calm acceptance of the beautiful imperfections and suspenseful twists inherent to life among tiny savages.
That said, it's tough to see it clearly when you're in the middle of it. Now that our years of juggling mewling babies made of terror and magic have been compressed into 12 minutes of scary sounds in the morning, plus one peaceful hour of conversation over dinner each night, I've entered an era of reckoning that sometimes feels like studying cave drawings to understand the last 17 years of my life. As Toonces and her little sister disappear down the road like some strange lingering punchline, I can see that the chills and spills will unfold elsewhere now -- out of sight, out of reach.
Case in point: The minivan has two new dents in it now, both in the front, both smeared with white paint. The white paint on the left is from the porch of a beach house with a very small driveway that was packed with cars at the time. The white paint on the right is from a high school student's white BMW.
It's too bad I can't carve the receipt for that BMW's body repair work into stone on a cave wall, so generations to come can marvel over the financial entanglements that arose among ancient youths learning to align their fossil-fueled chariots alongside each other's.
At least the van's bumper has been rendered triumphantly trapezoidal, a true beacon unto the more privileged children driving to school in shiny, perfect sports cars. "They must envy you," I told my older daughter, explaining how her crushed bumpers are a sign that she is crushing it without undue assistance from any wealthy overlords.
Imagine driving your dream car before you've even had your first job! Imagine never knowing the character-building satisfactions of menial chores like vacuuming and cleaning toilets, tasks that must seem so silly to her rich classmates, since their cleaning lady handles them each week. Yet these are precisely the filthy and demeaning hardships that build resilience and fortitude!
Not surprisingly, my older daughter remained unmoved by my words, and right now she's stomping around angrily upstairs. My husband looks preemptively agitated and ready to lay down the law, but I give him a look that says, Surrender Dorothy.
Because even though the minutes between 8:30 and 8:42 are dark and full of terrors, it's a lot for small children who were just slurping out of juice boxes a millisecond ago to be showering and gathering their things and doing the expert-makeup-artist level of pruning and polishing they learned on TikTok and then eating breakfast and then navigating a fossil-fueled chariot without bashing into another chariot by accident. That's hardship, for them. But I keep telling them to notice that it's also fun. I keep pointing out that it's scary but it's also joyful, all of it, even the part where they're crying on the phone to say that they smashed a car and what do I do now?
When my daughter asked me that, I told her what I tell myself each morning: "Don't overthink it. These calamities happen all the time, to everyone. Try to enjoy the drama of it all."
I might be talking about joy too much, so much that it makes me unbearable to be around, like a bubbly baby whale. I'm not surrendering to chaos now so much as savoring it. But can you blame me? Those playful idiots from outer space are starting to pack up their spacecraft, getting ready to leave for good. The terror and the magic are slipping out of my sight, out of my grasp. And it's a lot for a middle-aged woman who was possessed a millisecond ago, to face a life of autonomy and free will. Don't leave yet, I whisper to them. Not yet.

Marina Cicogna, 89, Italy's Barrier-Breaking Producer: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A countess from an influential Italian family, she charted her own course and produced films by the likes of Pasolini and Zeffirelli.
Marina Cicogna, an Italian countess who became her country's first major female film producer, guiding to the screen celebrated films by Pier Paolo Pasolini, Franco Zeffirelli and Elio Petri, died on Nov. 4 at her home in Rome. She was 89.
Her death was announced by La Biennale di Venezia, the organizer of the Venice Film Festival. No cause was given.
Rising to prominence in an era when the only female names on film posters were often those of actresses, Ms. Cicogna (pronounced chi-CONE-ya) became one of the most powerful women in European cinema, as both a producer and a distributor.
She started from a lofty perch. Her maternal grandfather, Count Giuseppe Volpi di Misurata, was an industrialist and statesman who served various government roles, including as Italy's minister of finance under Mussolini. He also founded the Venice Film Festival. In the mid-1960s, when Ms. Cicogna was in her early 30s, she and her brother Bino took control of her family's production and distribution company, Euro International Films.
Even so, she faced challenges: working with imperious male auteurs; earning the respect of the country's left-leaning cultural leaders despite her titled upbringing; and openly dating women as well as men at a time when such topics were rarely discussed in public by figures of authority.
Nor was her path as a woman always easy. "At the time I didn't think about it," she said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter Roma this year. "But at the end of the day, yes, the intention to put you down was there, definitely."
Among the prominent films she produced or distributed were "Medea" (1969), Pasolini's hypnotic reimagining of the Euripides tragedy, starring the opera singer Maria Callas; "Teorema" (1968), also directed by Pasolini, in which Terence Stamp plays an enigmatic stranger who seduces, one by one, members of a wealthy family in Milan; "Brother Sun Sister Moon" (1972), Zeffirelli's lush retelling of the life of St. Francis of Assisi; and "Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion," Petri's Kafkaesque thriller, which won the Academy Award for best foreign-language film in 1971.
Ms. Cicogna also had three films at the 1967 Venice Film Festival, including Luis Buñuel's "Belle de Jour," starring Catherine Deneuve as a Paris housewife who secretly works at a bordello, which won the festival's highest prize, the Golden Lion. In addition, she put her stamp on the proceedings by throwing a lavish party that became festival lore.
"I didn't give a big ball, but rather said that everyone could dress as they wanted, as long as they were in white and yellow or white and gold," Ms. Cicogna said in a 2013 interview with T, The New York Times's style magazine. "I sent two small Learjets, one to Corsica to pick up Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, and the other to Rome to pick up Jane Fonda and Roger Vadim."
Such obvious displays of wealth would go out of fashion following the leftist student uprisings in Europe in 1968. "You couldn't have a big party without hurting people's feelings," she continued. "You couldn't go around with a Rolls-Royce without being thrown eggs at."
Countess Marina Cicogna Mozzoni Volpi di Misurata was born on May 29, 1934, in Rome, the daughter of Count Cesare Cicogna Mozzoni, a banker, and Countess Annamaria Volpi di Misurata, who purchased Euro International Films, ultimately handing control over to her children.
Growing up, Ms. Cicogna was a cinema lover who mingled among the children of David O. Selznick, the producer of "Gone With the Wind," and other film heavyweights at the Venice festival.
After an education in Italy, she enrolled at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, N.Y., where she roomed with Barbara Warner, whose father was the Hollywood film mogul Jack Warner. During a school break, Ms. Warner invited her to California.
"I never went back," Ms. Cicogna told T. "I stayed for three months in California at the Warners'."
She later studied photography in the United States, brokering her platinum connections to shoot luminaries like Ezra Pound and Marilyn Monroe in candid moments.
Her early forays into the film business included distributing a 1967 West German film, "Helga." "It was the first time you saw a birth, a woman producing a child, on film," she told T. "I decided we should publicize it. We put ambulances at the exit of the film, saying that people would faint when they saw that."
She was at times linked romantically with the likes of Warren Beatty and Alain Delon, but she also spent decades in a relationship with Florinda Bolkan, a Brazilian model and actress.
After they split, she began a long relationship with Benedetta Gardona, a woman more than two decades her junior, whom Ms. Cicogna legally adopted for financial reasons. Ms. Gardona remained her companion until Ms. Cicogna's death. (Complete information on survivors was not immediately available).
Ms. Cicogna looked back on her career highlights of the 1960s and '70s in the 2021 documentary "Marina Cicogna: La Vita e Tutto il Resto" ("Life and Everything Else"), directed by Andrea Bettinetti, as well as her autobiography, "Ancora Spero: Una Storia di Vita e di Cinema" ("I Still Hope: A Story of Life and Cinema"), published this year.
Still, in a 2017 video interview, she expressed regret that she had not remained in the film business. "If I had to look back, I should have never stopped producing, although Italian cinematography has not been the same since. It's not so great," she said, adding: "I am also a person who is very torn between the European rather lazy aesthetic way of life and the American more creative, more active way of life."
"I've been more European than active," she said. "I haven't done as much as I should have done. But I can't say I'm sorry. That's the way it was, and that's it."

David Kirke, Prankster Who Made the First Bungee Jump, Dies at 78: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An Oxford-educated prankster as colorful as he was daring, he accidentally helped invent a new extreme sport in the 1970s.
David Kirke, a flamboyant thrill-seeker who performed -- and, more important, survived -- what is widely acknowledged as the first modern bungee jump, died on Oct. 21 at his home in Oxford, England. He was 78.
His death was confirmed by his brother Hugh Potter, who said no cause had been determined.
Mr. Kirke, an irrepressible daredevil and prankster, helped found the Dangerous Sports Club at the University of Oxford in the late 1970s. He inadvertently led this tiny band of eccentrics, plucked from the upper rungs of British society, into a historic plunge off the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, England, on April Fools' Day in 1979.
Inspiration came in part from a rite-of-passage ritual on the South Pacific island country Vanuatu known as land diving, in which young men leap from high towers, using vines to break their fall. Mr. Kirke opted for an elastic rope used by the military to help fighter jets land on aircraft carriers.
"We hadn't tested it or anything like that," Mr. Kirke told the news site BristolLive in 2019. "We were called the Dangerous Sports Club, and testing it first wouldn't have been particularly dangerous."
Clad in a top hat and tails, with a bottle of Champagne in hand, Mr. Kirke, who was nursing a hangover from an all-night party, was the first to take the plunge that day. The other jumpers -- Alan Weston, Tim Hunt and Simon Keeling -- "waited to see what would happen to me," Mr. Kirke told ITV News in 2019. "When I started bouncing up again, they all jumped."
Police promptly arrested the jumpers, charged them with breach of peace and tossed them behind bars for a spell before letting them off with a small fine. Jail was hardly a traumatic experience. "They were the only police force I've ever known to bring half-empty bottles of red wine, from the party, in a brown paper bag and give it to us in prison," he told ITV.
Little did the jumpers know that their playful prank would inspire a popular pastime around the world. A video of a plunge from the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco by members of the club in the 1980s inspired a New Zealander named A.J. Hackett to develop controlled methods for bungee (alternatively spelled bungy) jumping and build a thriving business that popularized the sport.
Fortune, however, was not the point for Mr. Kirke, a writer by trade whose jobs included ghostwriting a newspaper column for a politician. Instead, he found fame with a lifetime of extravagant stunts, each seemingly more outlandish than the last.
He was born David Antony Christopher Potter on Sept. 26, 1945, in Shawbury, a village in Shropshire, in the West Midlands of England. He was the eldest of seven children of Arnold Potter, a schoolmaster, and Fraye (Kirke) Potter, a concert pianist from an illustrious military family. For reasons that remain unclear, he adopted his mother's maiden name as his surname while studying at Oxford. (Complete information about his survivors was not immediately available.)
While not strictly upper class by British standards, the Potters managed a more than comfortable existence. As Vanity Fair noted in a 2013 article, "The family wintered in Switzerland and summered in France, employed 15 servants and drove around in a vintage Rolls-Royce -- all at the last moment of British history when it was possible to enjoy such luxuries and still be considered middle class."
In 1964, Mr. Kirke enrolled in Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he studied psychology and philosophy. After graduating, he went to work for the publisher Calder & Boyars in London and edited a poetry journal.
His life took a tragic turn, his brother said in an email, when his girlfriend was struck and killed by a bus. Mr. Kirke quit his job and returned to the city of Oxford, where he fell in with a particularly colorful crowd.
The idea for the club arose, Vanity Fair reported, on an adventure-seeking trip with a friend, Edward Hulton, to the Swiss Alps. There they met a British department-store scion, named Chris Baker, who was dabbling with hang gliders. Mr. Kirke cajoled Mr. Baker into letting him take a spin on the contraption. After an exhilarating flight, he and Mr. Baker began musing over drinks about starting a club to explore new daredevil sports.
"What we hated was the way that formal sports had all these little, important bourgeois instructors saying, 'You've got to get through five-part exams to do this,"' Mr. Kirke told the magazine.
Straddling the line between danger sports and performance art, his stunts included steering a carousel horse down a ski slope in the Swiss Alps; piloting an inflatable kangaroo suspended by balloons over the English Channel; skateboarding among the running bulls of Pamplona, Spain; and arranging a sit-down meal on the rim of an erupting volcano on the Caribbean island of Saint Vincent.
While his initial jump in Bristol made him famous, Mr. Kirke had little time to ponder questions of posterity. As he tipped off the bridge, he told BristolLive, "The main thing going through my mind was, 'Whoooppeeee!"'

Dumped by a Bank: Why Accounts Suddenly Close: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Lieber, Ron; Tara Siegel Bernard

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Surprised individuals and small-business owners can't pay rent or make payroll, and no one ever explains what they did wrong.
The reasons vary, but the scene that plays out is almost always the same.
Bank customers get a letter in the mail saying their institution is closing all of their checking and savings accounts. Their debit and credit cards are shuttered, too. The explanation, if there is one, usually lacks any useful detail.
Or maybe the customers don't see the letter, or never get one at all. Instead, they discover that their accounts no longer work while they're at the grocery store, rental car counter or A.T.M. When they call their bank, frantic, representatives show concern at first. "Oh, no, so sorry," they say. "We'll do whatever we can to fix this."
But then comes the telltale pause and shift in tone. "Per your account agreement, we can close your account for any reason at any time," the script often goes.
These situations are what banks refer to as "exiting" or "de-risking." This isn't your standard boot for people who have bounced too many checks. Instead, a vast security apparatus has kicked into gear, starting with regulators in Washington and trickling down to bank security managers and branch staff eyeballing customers. The goal is to crack down on fraud, terrorism, money laundering, human trafficking and other crimes.
In the process, banks are evicting what appear to be an increasing number of individuals, families and small-business owners. Often, they don't have the faintest idea why their banks turned against them.
But there are almost always red flags -- transactions that appear out of character, for example -- that lead to the eviction. The algorithmically generated alerts are reviewed every day by human employees.
Banks generally won't say how often they are closing accounts this way, and they're not tracking how often they get it wrong. But federal data offer clues.
By law, banks must file a "suspicious activity report" when they see transactions or behavior that might violate the law, like unexpectedly large cash transactions or wire transfers with banks in high-risk countries. According to Thomson Reuters, banks filed over 1.8 million SARs in 2022, a 50 percent increase in just two years. This year, the figure is on track to hit nearly two million.
Multiple SARs often -- though not always -- lead to a customer's eviction. Federal laws have little to say about the trigger for account cancellations.
But a New York Times examination of over 500 cases of this dropping of customers by their banks -- and interviews with more than a dozen current and former bank industry insiders -- illustrates the chaos and confusion that ensue when banks decide on their own to cut people off.
Individuals can't pay their bills on time. Banks often take weeks to send them their balances. When the institutions close their credit cards, their credit scores can suffer.
Upon cancellation, small businesses often struggle to make payroll -- and must explain to vendors and partners that they don't have a bank account for the time being.
As if the lack of explanation and recourse were not enough, once customers have moved on, they don't know whether there is a black mark somewhere on their permanent records that will cause a repeat episode at another bank. If the bank has filed a SAR, it isn't legally allowed to tell you, and the federal government prosecutes only a small fraction of the people whom the banks document in their SARs.
As a result, you don't know what you're under suspicion for. "You feel like you're walking around wearing this scarlet letter," said Caroline Potter, whose Citibank accounts were shut down abruptly last year.
The banks, facing ever more aggressive regulators and examiners, offer a modicum of sympathy.
"We want to build long-term relationships with our clients, which is why accounts are closed only after appropriate review and consideration of the facts," said Jerry Dubrowski, a spokesman for JPMorgan Chase, the nation's largest bank with 80 million retail customers and six million small-business ones, whose former account holders sent nearly 200 complaints to The Times.
"We act in accordance with our compliance program, consistent with our regulatory obligations," Mr. Dubrowski continued. "We know that can be frustrating to clients, but we must follow those obligations."
He added that "the vast majority of closures are correct, consistent with the regulatory obligations we are required to follow," and that the number of closed accounts was a fraction of the bank's overall business.
Federal data on the types of SARs that banks file show what they worry about most. Last year, banks filing SARs tagged categories like suspicious checks, concern over the source of the funds and "transaction with no apparent economic, business or lawful purpose" most often, according to Thomson Reuters.
To former bank employees, the bloodless data belie the havoc that banks wreak. "There is no humanization to any of this, and it's all just numbers on a screen," said Aaron Ansari, who used to program the algorithms that flag suspicious activity. "It's not 'No, that is a single mom running a babysitting business.' "It's 'Hey, you've checked these boxes for a red flag -- you're out."'
What follow are profiles of customers who lost their accounts and an analysis of what behavior may have spurred their banks to shun them.
Unusual (or the Usual) Cash Deposits
Bryan Delaney has owned several New York City bars over the decades, and he and his business partner and general manager, Jennifer Maslanka, have a longstanding system for handling cash: It goes to the bank on Fridays and Mondays.
As card use has increased over the years, the size of the deposits has decreased. To make the accounting easier on new staff who started working during the pandemic, Mr. Delaney and Ms. Maslanka often rounded deposits down to the nearest thousand and kept the rest of the cash on hand to make change.
This year, Chase closed the bar's account, plus personal checking and credit-card accounts for Mr. Delaney, his wife and Ms. Maslanka, giving them a handful of weeks to make other banking arrangements.
Federal law requires depositors to fill out a form if they're depositing or withdrawing more than $ 10,000 in cash. Sometimes, in an attempt to avoid the gaze of the authorities, account holders will engage in "structuring," making a series of transactions just under $ 10,000. It's one of the top reasons that banks file suspicious activity reports.
Mr. Dubrowski, the JPMorgan Chase spokesman, said the bar's series of deposits was indeed the problem.
"We must know our customers and monitor the transactions that flow through our bank," he said. "That includes instances where we see a pattern of cash deposits that are just below federal currency reporting thresholds."
Mr. Delaney said he had not been engaged in structuring when depositing money in round numbers. All the cash had come from the bars, he said, and he reported his income and paid his taxes as he was supposed to.
The bank's explanation is especially maddening, given that he and Ms. Maslanka had filled out plenty of the $ 10,000 forms over the years. "What's to gain from not filling it out?" he said. "What's the risk of filling it out? I've done both when deposits warranted that."
"I'm still so confused," Ms. Maslanka said. "Do you think I'm part of some underground Mafia, laundering money through my little beer bar?"
A Marijuana Connection
For Caroline Potter, the trouble began on the phone.
"There were these weird calls with a very mysterious customer care department, and they kept asking for our tax returns," she said. "No one sees my tax returns except the I.R.S. and my C.P.A."
Ms. Potter and her husband had moved to Idaho during the pandemic, selling their old house in New York and buying a new one. Some large chunks of money moved between their various Citibank accounts -- the sale, the mortgage payoff, the down payment on the new abode -- but nothing that the bank would not have seen before.
Then, suddenly, Citi shut down everything, including their checking accounts and credit cards. The couple's attempts to get an explanation led to nothing but frustration.
"It felt like there was this secretive department, and anyone who wasn't in that department didn't even know about it," Ms. Potter said.
Her hunch is that Citi didn't like that her husband's income comes as direct deposits from the cannabis company that recently acquired his employer. Is the company on some kind of do-not-engage list that Citi keeps?
Citi declined to comment, even though Ms. Potter granted the bank permission to speak about the couple's accounts.
International Wires
Oore Ladipo, who is from Nigeria, had been working as a data analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York -- it was a contract job -- while earning a master's degree in quantitative method and modeling.
After Mr. Ladipo received his degree, he got an offer for a permanent position but couldn't start until he received his employment documents from the federal government. It took a few months, so his parents -- both civil servants at the time -- wired him money from Nigeria, probably around $ 1,500 a month, to help him make rent in early 2018.
That summer, Chase sent him a letter saying his accounts would be shuttered. "They were aware of my study, work and family history but still closed my account after almost 10 years," he said. Mr. Ladipo, now 30, had banked with Chase since he moved to Ohio in 2010 for college.
Mr. Ladipo felt confused and betrayed, but he believed that the Nigerian wires were the likely culprit.
"And in this scenario, you can't really negotiate," he said. "You aren't talking with a person who has the power to tell you what went wrong and what didn't go wrong."
Wires and suspicious electronic transfers are another common reason that banks file SARs. But in Mr. Ladipo's case, the cause for suspicion was a third party -- a suspected fraudster -- that surfaced in his web of transactions.
"We must know our customers and monitor the transactions that flow through our bank," Mr. Dubrowski said, who stressed that the bank was not accusing Mr. Ladipo of any wrongdoing. "That includes instances where we suspect that the transactions involve parties connected to potential scams."
That explanation didn't satisfy Mr. Ladipo, who said the lack of specificity left him wondering if even his rent check could have been cause for suspicion -- or if his background might have caused his accounts to warrant a closer look.
"I can't tell if being from a different part of the world makes me an increased risk for the algorithm or if there is bias against me in their decision-making process," he said.
Unusual Cash Withdrawals
When Steven Ferker bought a house in New York in late 2016, he withdrew money from one of his Citi accounts in chunks of $ 7,000 to $ 12,000 to pay his contractor, who requested cash payments. He also used a Citi credit card with a 12-month, zero-interest offer to buy things for the kitchen in 2017.
He was surprised when the bank called to ask why he was making repeated cash withdrawals. Each time, he explained the situation. "I assumed they were calling to make sure someone was not stealing my money, and I was glad that they called," he said. "But I never gave it two thoughts until they threw me out."
Citi declined to comment.
Mr. Ferker was aware of banks' wariness of large transactions in round numbers, but he was taking out his own money and immediately giving it to a contractor doing visible work. "Cash is legal tender in this country," he said. "I understand that people hide their income, but I figured that was none of my business. It's his business."
As is the pattern, the Dear John letter from the bank offered no explanation. But when he went into the branch, the frustrated manager said more than he was supposed to. "The answer was: 'Don't ask me. Ask the computer that flagged you,"' Mr. Ferker said.
Criminal History
Nick Seidel, 42, of Chicago, has had his bank break up with him three times. Chase dumped him first. Then, after an 18-month relationship with Fifth Third, it, too, shut down his accounts.
At BMO Harris, Mr. Seidel struck up a relationship with his personal banker and told him about his banking troubles and his suspicion of what was behind them: He had served time in prison.
The banker assured him that it wouldn't be a problem, until it was: The letter arrived roughly 18 months later. Mr. Seidel took it in to show his banker. "No way," Mr. Seidel recalled him saying. The banker made a call while Mr. Seidel was waiting in his office, then typed something into his computer.
"I'm not supposed to tell you this," the banker said. He turned his computer monitor around so Mr. Seidel could see it.
It was his mug shot from about 10 years before.
"I had never had any banking issues, no overdrafts or suspicious activity," Mr. Seidel said. "Apparently some banks just run public searches of their clients and drop them if they are justice-impacted. It's always a frustrating, inconvenient and embarrassing experience."
In 2011, Mr. Seidel stole a 2002 BMW from a car dealership and used a counterfeit $ 20 bill, among other crimes. He served five years in prison, where he underwent cognitive behavioral therapy and earned several paralegal certificates.
Mr. Seidel saved money he earned from drafting legal documents for other inmates. After he was released in December 2015, a friend picked him up, and they headed straight to the bank so Mr. Seidel could start his life anew.
Using a state-issued identification card and a check from the Department of Corrections, he opened a checking account at Chase. "It wasn't like they didn't know," he said.
But the bank later shut down the account after learning that he had used counterfeit money.
"We believe in giving people with conviction histories a second chance while we balance our obligation to mitigate potential financial crimes," Mr. Dubrowski, the spokesman, said. "So, customers who have prior convictions for financial crimes may not be able to open an account with us for a period of time."
Fifth Third and BMO Harris declined to comment on Mr. Seidel's situation, even though he provided permission for them to do so.
Mr. Seidel, who has a mortgage through Fifth Third and was recently accepted into a master's of legal studies program, is working as a paralegal under a contract with a federal regulator. The kicker: He helps investigate securities fraud, a job that required a four-hour background check.
But he still keeps two bank accounts open as a contingency plan.
Community Loan Pools
Banks dislike any patterns that look like scams and will shut down behavior that seems suspicious.
But bank customers often don't get to explain themselves in the moment. When Rosanna Bynoe, who lives in San Francisco with her husband, opened a new Chase account, she told the representative exactly what they'd be using it for: a susu.
Susus are community savings and loan pools, and they often have a person at the center of them collecting and distributing money. Ms. Bynoe's mother and grandmother had set money aside this way over the years, and she and her husband were trying to participate electronically. Each week, they sent the same amount of money via Zelle, the electronic payment platform in which JPMorgan Chase is a part owner, to the same person, who was a kind of susu captain.
One day in 2019, Ms. Bynoe and her husband lost access to their bank accounts and credit cards. Ms. Bynoe's husband went to a branch banker, explained the susu and showed how the lump sum of savings had come back into the couple's account each year for three years.
It did not help. "It was like he was speaking to a machine," Ms. Bynoe said.
The whole situation was simultaneously baffling and infuriating, she said. Why does the bank get to tell her how often or how frequently and with what amount she can do things with her money? Why didn't it tell her ahead of time that she might have a problem when she declared her intentions?
And given the long history of racism in the banking industry, did the fact that lots of Black people use susus have something to do with losing her account?
"What part of our profile tells you that we are doing fraudulent activity?" Ms. Bynoe said, who is mixed race, echoing the question that Chase's branch bankers did not answer. "If people of color are disproportionately affected by this issue, then that needs to be looked at."
Mr. Dubrowski said the overall movement of money didn't appear proper. "We must know our customers and monitor the transactions that flow through our bank," including instances where the bank sees a pattern of activity that could be associated with a scam, he said.
"We do not close accounts based on race, ethnicity or national origin, and we didn't in this case," he added.
Out of curiosity, Ms. Bynoe called a Chase credit card representative in April to see how long the company had barred her. The rep said it was for life. Mr. Dubrowski said that there were no lifetime bans and that the bank made decisions on a case-by-case basis.
Ms. Bynoe and her husband figured that Chase's actions would create long-term repercussions for them in the financial system or even with the government. After all, Chase didn't say there wouldn't be further trouble. But Citi and Bank of America were happy to continue to do business with them.
This was a relief. It was also quite odd. "You've got one bank telling you that you're essentially a fraudster," Ms. Bynoe said. "But all of the rest of the world is good. I don't understand."

Union Victories May Also Lift Biden Politically: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: President Biden's support for autoworkers helped them make big wage gains, and labor organizers are looking to bring about similar gains elsewhere as carmakers transition to electric vehicles.
The United Automobile Workers' big wins with Detroit's Big Three automakers could also prove to be a significant political victory for President Biden, who openly sided with striking workers to pressure the companies, General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, to produce generous concessions.
But the U.A.W.'s turn now toward nonunionized automakers like Tesla, Hyundai, BMW and Mercedes will test whether Mr. Biden's support, as well as measures that he signed into law, will produce the expansion of organized labor that he has long promised.
For unionized autoworkers, many of them in the swing state of Michigan, the tentative contracts, which are awaiting rank-and-file ratification, would bring substantial wage gains, "another piece of good economic news," Mr. Biden said on Monday. The tentative contracts would lift the top U.A.W. wage to more than $ 40 per hour over four and a half years, from $ 32 an hour. Stellantis, maker of Chryslers, Jeeps and Ram trucks, agreed to reopen its assembly plant in Belvidere, Ill., near the border of Wisconsin, another crucial swing state.
"The impact of Biden's public support can't be overstated," said Steve Smith, a spokesman for the umbrella A.F.L.-C.I.O., which includes the autoworkers' union. "There's a lot of upside here for Biden. The contracts set a new standard for the industry that clearly show the benefit of collective bargaining."
Beyond that, G.M. agreed to bring its electric vehicle battery joint venture, Ultium, under the national contract, a boon for Ultium workers but also a pressure point for unions as they seek to organize battery plants sprouting up around the country. Such plants are using generous subsidies from Mr. Biden's signature legislative achievements -- especially the climate change provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act -- as the administration pushes to speed the country's transition to electric vehicles.
"This historic contract is a testament to the power of unions and collective bargaining to build strong middle-class jobs while helping our most iconic American companies thrive," Mr. Biden said Monday evening.
Jason Walsh, the executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, which has brought together labor and environmental groups to marshal support for the clean energy transition, said the contracts, if ratified by U.A.W. workers, would be a watershed moment for the economy -- and possibly the planet.
"The legislative intent behind the industrial policy in the Inflation Reduction Act was an implicit deal: We as a nation are going to invest in the sectors of the economy that are important to the country and the planet in the long run, but in return we want the companies that receive those benefits to maximize returns to workers, communities and the environment," Mr. Walsh said. To that end, the contract settlement is "huge," he added. "It highlights the lie peddled by Donald Trump and at times the Big Three that the E.V. transition means lower-quality jobs in a nonunion work force."
The U.A.W. actions took on strikingly political meaning. In May, the autoworkers' union opted to withhold an endorsement of Mr. Biden's re-election, openly expressing "our concerns with the electric vehicle transition" that the president was pushing through legislation and regulation.
Last month, Mr. Biden became the first sitting U.S. president to join a picket line. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, castigated striking workers, saying "they want more money working fewer hours. They want more benefits working fewer days."
Mr. Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, visited a nonunion parts plant in Michigan to rail against electric vehicles and to demand that Shawn Fain, the new and aggressive U.A.W. president, endorse him for another term in the White House.
Mr. Fain said he would never do that, and supporters of the president pointed to provisions in federal laws championed by Mr. Biden that may have helped secure the deals. Subsidies for electric vehicle production will go only to domestic manufacturing plants, meaning Detroit management could not credibly threaten to move new auto plants overseas in search of cheaper labor.
But union officials did not say on Monday what their intentions were for a presidential endorsement. Mr. Fain did make clear over the weekend that he was not resting on his laurels with the gains achieved with its escalating wave of strikes against the Big Three. The union plans to target Tesla, the nonunion automaker that dominates the domestic electric vehicle market, as well as foreign automakers with factories in the Southeast, where unions have struggled to gain a foothold. Some of the biggest new plants are under construction in Georgia, a critical swing state for 2024, including a Hyundai electric vehicle plant that will be the state's biggest economic development project ever.
Organizers will be able to lean on provisions of the three big laws that Mr. Biden signed -- a $ 1 trillion infrastructure bill, a $ 280 billion measure to rekindle a domestic semiconductor industry and the Inflation Reduction Act, which included $ 370 billion for clean energy to combat climate change -- to push their case.
Tucked into all of those laws were measures to give unions the power to effectively tell employers that accept rich federal tax incentives this: You must pay union-scale wages and use union apprenticeship and training programs, so you might as well hire union workers.
How electric vehicle and battery makers respond to the U.A.W.'s next push will go a long way toward determining whether Mr. Biden can make good on his promise that his effort to curtail climate change and wean the nation off fossil fuels will indeed produce "good union jobs."

Autoworkers Score Big Victories In New Contracts Ending Strikes: [National Desk]

Full text: Tentative accords at Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis are the most generous in decades, raising costs as the industry shifts to electric vehicles.
A six-week wave of strikes that hobbled the three largest U.S. automakers has resulted in tentative contract agreements that would give workers their biggest pay raises in decades while avoiding a protracted work stoppage that could have damaged the economy.
On Monday, General Motors and the United Automobile Workers reached a deal that mirrored agreements the union had reached in recent days with Ford Motor and Stellantis, the parent company of Ram, Jeep and Chrysler. The terms will be costly for the automakers as they undertake a switch to electric vehicles, while setting the stage for labor strife and demands for higher pay at nonunion automakers like Tesla and Toyota.
The tentative agreements, which still require ratification by union members, also appeared to be a win for President Biden, who had risked political capital by picketing with striking workers at a G.M. facility in Michigan last month.
"They have reached a historic agreement," Mr. Biden said Monday after speaking with Shawn Fain, the U.A.W. president. The deals, the president said, "reward autoworkers who gave up much to keep the industry working and going during the global financial crisis more than a decade ago."
The strike stretched longer than White House officials would have liked, but was resolved before causing significant shortages of new cars and trucks that might have frustrated voters already angry about inflation.
"The near-term impact of this strike will be relatively minor," said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars.com, an online auto sales site.
But Mr. Brauer warned that, in the long term, Ford, G.M. and Stellantis would have to raise car prices to maintain their profits. Their competitors will follow suit to take advantage of the opportunity to earn more money, he said. "This is going to make cars more expensive," Mr. Brauer added.
G.M.'s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said in a statement on Monday that the tentative agreement "reflects the contributions of the team while enabling us to continue to invest in our future and provide good jobs in the U.S."
Potentially the most far-reaching effect of the strike could be on manufacturing workers not represented by the U.A.W. The contracts the union negotiated are the latest in a series of prominent victories for organized labor, including Hollywood writers, UPS workers and even some university employees.
Mr. Fain has portrayed the tentative agreements as a signal for the union to begin organizing drives at Tesla, which dominates the fast-growing electric car business, and foreign-owned companies like Toyota, Honda and BMW that have large nonunion operations in the United States. The union will "organize like we've never organized before," Mr. Fain said Sunday.
Companies without unions can expect the U.A.W. to deploy the same hardball tactics that Mr. Fain used against Ford, G.M. and Stellantis, including rhetorical attacks on multimillion-dollar executive pay and hourly wages that have failed to keep pace with high inflation.
Even if those union campaigns fail, as they often have in the past, they may prompt some employers to pre-emptively give workers raises.
"This agreement is going to have a trickle-down effect," said Helen Rella, who specializes in employment litigation at Wilk Auslander, a New York law firm.
Ford agreed on a tentative pact on Wednesday. Stellantis followed on Saturday. Details of all the agreements had not yet been published, but they include a 25 percent pay increase over the next four and a half years and provisions to make sure the raises are not eaten up by inflation.
The top U.A.W. wage would rise to more than $ 40 over the life of the new contracts, from $ 32 an hour. That would allow employees working 40 hours a week to earn about $ 84,000 a year.
The agreements provide at least some protections to workers as electric vehicles replace gasoline models, and jobs at battery factories supplant jobs making components for combustion engine vehicles.
In Ford's case, workers at battery factories that the company plans to build in Tennessee and Michigan would be covered by the terms of the union contract. (Ford suspended work at the Michigan plant in September, saying it was not sure it could manufacture batteries there at a competitive price.)
The U.A.W. said its new contract with G.M. would cover workers at Ultium Cells, a battery-making joint venture with LG Energy Solution. One Ultium factory, in Ohio, is up and running, and two others are under construction in Tennessee and Michigan.
The increases in hourly wages would add to the automakers' costs when they already pay their workers more than Tesla and most foreign automakers. But the burden would be manageable, analysts said.
"Everybody had their pencils out, and I'm quite certain the deal wouldn't have been signed if they weren't confident they could remain competitive," said Steve Patton, mobility sector leader for consulting firm EY.
The agreements appear to be victories on multiple fronts for Mr. Biden, who has yoked his economic message to his success at delivering for union workers.
Mr. Biden's brief stint on a U.A.W. picket line last month was a first for a sitting president. He has promised that union workers would benefit from tax credits and other incentives to encourage people to buy electric vehicles. The incentives are available only for cars made in the United States, Canada or Mexico.
The biggest risk to Mr. Biden -- that the contract hinders automakers' competitiveness -- is unlikely to become manifest before next year's election.
The union's contracts with the three automakers, covering nearly 150,000 workers, expired on Sept. 15. Since then, the union has called on more than 45,000 workers to walk off the job at factories and spare-parts warehouses across the country. In the most recent escalation on Saturday, shortly after the union reached a deal with Stellantis, the U.A.W. told workers to go on strike at G.M.'s plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., which makes several sport utility vehicle models.
The strike has halted the production of some of the companies' most profitable vehicles, including the Cadillac Escalade S.U.V., the Ram 1500 pickup truck and the Ford Bronco S.U.V.
G.M. said last week that the strike had lowered its earnings by about $ 800 million, before interest and taxes, with part of the impact coming in the third quarter and most in the fourth quarter.
Ford's deal with the U.A.W. would shave about one percentage point off the company's profit margin, said Tom Narayan, global autos analyst at RBC Capital Markets. But he said the carmakers faced bigger challenges, like a decline in consumer's ability to buy new vehicles and a slowdown in the growth of electric vehicle sales.
"I don't think the U.A.W. in a vacuum is going to be the big problem," Mr. Narayan said. "There are other problems these companies have."
A Ford executive said last week that the new contract would raise production costs by up to $ 900 a vehicle. The company said it would provide more details once workers ratified the contract.
The three large U.S. automakers are investing tens of billions of dollars to develop new electric vehicles, build battery plants and retool factories in an effort to catch up to Tesla, which is based in Austin, Texas, and has factories there and in Fremont, Calif.; Sparks, Nev.; and Buffalo. In addition to lower labor costs, the electric car company's advantages include selling cars directly to customers rather than through dealers, who take a slice of the profit from each sale of a car made by Ford, G.M. and Stellantis.
"We need to make sure we have a contract that is going to allow us to compete and win in what is a challenging market for E.V.s," Ms. Barra said last week.

A six-week wave of strikes that hobbled the three largest U.S. automakers has put workers on track for new contracts that will deliver the biggest pay raise workers will receive in decades while avoiding a protracted work stoppage that could have damaged the economy.
General Motors was firming up a deal with the United Auto Workers union Monday that was expected to mirror agreements the union reached in recent days with Ford Motor and Stellantis, the parent company of Ram, Jeep and Chrysler. The terms will be costly for the automakers as they undertake a switch to electric vehicles, while setting the stage for labor strife and demands for higher pay at nonunion automakers such as Tesla and Toyota.

Ford agreed on a tentative pact on Wednesday. Stellantis followed on Saturday. GM reached a tentative agreement on Monday, according to two people familiar with the matter who asked to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss the deal before it was made public. Details of all the agreements had not yet been published, but they include a 25% pay increase over the next 4 1/2 years and provisions to make sure the raises are not eaten up by inflation.

Companies without unions can expect the UAW to deploy the same hardball tactics that Fain used against Ford, GM, and Stellantis, including rhetorical attacks on multimillion-dollar executive pay and hourly wages that have failed to keep pace with high inflation.
Even if those union campaigns fail, as they often have in the past, they may prompt some employers to preemptively give workers raises.
“This agreement is going to have a trickle-down effect,” said Helen Rella, who specializes in employment litigation at Wilk Auslander, a New York law firm.
Ford agreed on a tentative pact on Wednesday. Stellantis followed on Saturday. Details of all the agreements had not yet been published, but they include a 25% pay increase over the next 4 1/2 years and provisions to make sure the raises are not eaten up by inflation.
The top UAW wage would rise to more than $40 over the life of the new contracts, from $32 an hour. That would allow employees working 40 hours a week to earn about $84,000 a year.
The agreements provide at least some protections to workers as electric vehicles replace gasoline models, and jobs at battery factories supplant jobs making components for combustion engine vehicles.
In Ford’s case, workers at battery factories the company plans to build in Tennessee and Michigan would be covered by the terms of the union contract. (Ford suspended work at the Michigan plant in September, saying it was not sure it could manufacture batteries there at a competitive price.)
The UAW said its new contract with GM would cover workers at Ultium Cells, a battery-making joint venture with LG Energy Solution. One Ultium factory, in Ohio, is up and running, and two others are under construction in Tennessee and Michigan.
The increases in hourly wages would add to the automaker’s costs when they already pay their workers more than Tesla and most foreign automakers. But the burden would be manageable, analysts said.
“Everybody had their pencils out and I’m quite certain the deal wouldn’t have been signed if they weren’t confident they could remain competitive,” said Steve Patton, mobility sector leader for consulting firm EY.
The agreements appear to be victories on multiple fronts for Biden, who has yoked his economic message to his success at delivering for union workers.
Biden’s brief stint on a UAW picket line last month was a first for a sitting president. He has promised that union workers would benefit from tax credits and other incentives to encourage people to buy electric vehicles. The incentives are available only for cars made in the United States, Canada or Mexico.
The biggest risk to Biden — that the contract hinders automakers’ competitiveness — is unlikely to become manifest before next year’s election.
The union’s contracts with the three automakers covering nearly 150,000 workers expired on Sept. 15. Since then, the union has called on more than 45,000 workers to walk off the job at factories and spare-parts warehouses across the country. In the most recent escalation on Saturday, shortly after the union reached a deal with Stellantis, the UAW told workers to go on strike at GM’s plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, which makes several sport utility vehicle models.
The strike has halted the production of some of the companies’ most profitable vehicles, including the Cadillac Escalade SUV, the Ram 1500 pickup truck and the Ford Bronco SUV.
GM said last week that the strike had lowered its earnings by about $800 million, before interest and taxes, with part of the impact coming in the third quarter and most in the fourth quarter.
Ford’s deal with the UAW would shave about 1 percentage point off the company's profit margin, said Tom Narayan, global autos analyst at RBC Capital Markets. But he said the carmakers faced bigger challenges, such as a decline in consumer’s ability to buy new vehicles and a slowdown in the growth of electric vehicle sales.
“I don’t think the UAW in a vacuum is going to be the big problem,” Narayan said. “There are other problems these companies have.”
A Ford executive said last week that the new contract would raise production costs by up to $900 a vehicle. The company said it would provide more details once workers ratified the contract.
The three large U.S. automakers are investing tens of billions of dollars to develop new electric vehicles, build battery plants and retool factories in an effort to catch up to Tesla, which is based in Austin, Texas, and has factories there and in Fremont, California; Sparks, Nevada; and Buffalo, New York. In addition to lower labor costs, the electric car company‘s advantages include selling cars directly to customers rather than through dealers who take a slice of the profit from each sale of a car made by Ford, GM and Stellantis.
“We need to make sure we have a contract that is going to allow us to compete and win in what is a challenging market for EVs,” Barra said last week.

U.A.W. Deal Won't Put Ford At a Disadvantage, Analysts Say: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A tentative agreement gives union members at the carmaker their best terms in decades but could complicate Ford's electric vehicle plans.
When autoworkers went on strike in September, executives of the large U.S. automakers warned that union demands could significantly undermine their ability to compete in a fast-changing industry. The chief executive of Ford Motor said that the company might have to scrap its investment in electric vehicles.
The future doesn't look quite that bleak now that Ford and the United Automobile Workers union have reached a tentative agreement that is likely to serve as a template for deals the union eventually reaches with General Motors and Stellantis, the maker of Ram, Jeep and Chrysler.
Ford's costs will rise under the terms of the new contract, which includes a 25 percent raise over four and a half years, improved retirement benefits and other provisions. The extra expense will weigh on profit and could hamper Ford's ability to invest in new technology, John Lawler, the company's chief financial officer, said Thursday.
But some analysts said the increases should be manageable. What will matter more for the company's prospects, they said, is how innovative and efficient the company is in designing and producing cars and technology that can compete with offerings from Tesla, which dominates electric vehicles, the auto industry's fastest growing segment.
"They haven't agreed to anything that will kill their competitiveness," said Joshua Murray, an associate professor at Vanderbilt University who is an author of a book that examined how U.S. automakers lost ground to Japanese and European rivals. He said the deal could even help Ford, in part because the four-year contract ensures there would be no labor strife during an intense phase of the transition to electric vehicles.
"They won't be engaged in labor conflict while they're dealing with" the technology shift, Mr. Murray said.
Ford said on Thursday that it earned $ 1.2 billion from July through September on revenue of $ 44 billion; the company lost $ 827 million in the third quarter of 2022. But the division that makes electric vehicles lost $ 1.3 billion because of investments in new technology and increasing competition that has pushed down prices.
The roughly 17,000 Ford workers who had been on strike, out of a total of 57,000 U.A.W. employees at the company, are expected to begin returning to factories soon. At U.A.W. Local 900 in Wayne, Mich., across the street from a Ford plant that was one of the first three factories to be struck by the U.A.W., workers were disposing of signs, firewood and bottled water that had been stockpiled for picket lines.
"This is the best contract I have seen in my 30 years with Ford," said Robert Carter, 49, who works with engineers to lay out work stations on the assembly line. He said younger workers who had been earning well below the top wage of $ 32 an hour would see the biggest impact with the new contract; their pay would rise to more than $ 40 an hour over the next four and a half years.
"For some people, their pay is going to almost double," he said. "How can you say that's not huge?"
The reaction on Wall Street suggested that investors did not regard the agreement as a catastrophe. The carmaker's shares fell 1.7 percent during regular trading on Thursday.
But Ford stock slumped almost 5 percent in after-hours trading after the company said that, because of the cost of the strike, it could no longer stand by an earlier estimate that profit before interest expenses and taxes would be $ 11 billion to $ 12 billion in 2023. Mr. Lawler also said that strike would cost the company $ 1.3 billion this year.
Analysts at Barclays estimated the annual cost of pay raises, improved retirement benefits and other measures in the new union contract to be $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion annually by the end of the four-year contract period, or equivalent to about 1 percent of sales.
Mr. Lawler said on a conference call that the contract would raise the company's labor costs by an average of $ 850 to $ 900 per vehicle. He said Ford would try to "identify efficiencies and improve productivity to help us deliver on our targets" in light of those higher labor costs.
Some analysts were critical of the deal with the U.A.W., saying the cost to Ford could put it at a significant disadvantage, perhaps prompting the company to move more production to Mexico.
"It adds a constraint in a very competitive market," said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive. "It's definitely a compromise that, I think, down the road will either limit Ford's performance or force them to consider alternatives."
During the contentious negotiations, Ford complained that a big raise for workers would put it even further behind Tesla in the electric vehicle market. Sales of Ford's two main battery-powered models, the F-150 Lightning truck and the Mustang Mach-E sport-utility vehicle, have been disappointing this year, and the company recently scaled back plans to increase production of the Lightning.
"There is tremendous downward pressure on E.V. pricing," Mr. Lawler said.
But Tesla and other automakers like Toyota, Hyundai, Nissan and Honda, whose factories in the United States do not have unions, may now face pressure to raise wages, eroding any cost advantage they might have had.
The U.A.W. has declared its intention to try to organize those factories. The pay agreement with Ford, by far the biggest boost in compensation that the union has won in decades, is likely to serve as a powerful advertisement for collective bargaining.
"Elon Musk better be looking at this," said Madeline Janis, executive director of Jobs to Move America, an advocacy group that has close ties to organized labor. "Hyundai and Toyota better be looking at this. This is a new era where workers are standing up."
Tesla, the company Mr. Musk runs, and other carmakers that don't have union workers in the United States, like BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, may decide to pre-emptively hand out raises to keep labor organizers at bay.
"One strategy to deter union organizing is to raise wages," said Rebecca Kolins Givan, an associate professor of labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers University.
The decisive factor in the electric vehicle market will be the ability of Ford, G.M. and Stellantis to produce innovative products, Ms. Givan and others said. That is the responsibility of management, not assembly line workers.
"It's clear that these companies have work to do in the electric vehicle market," Ms. Givan said. "There is nothing in this contract that creates any constraints."
In addition to the 25 percent pay increase, the contract gives Ford's hourly workers cost-of-living wage adjustments, major gains on pensions and job security, and the right to strike over plant closings. The union had initially asked for a 40 percent wage increase.
Ford has not yet set dates for restarting plants idled by the strike. The company previously said it could take up to four weeks to reach full production. Ford also needs some 600 suppliers to resume production and to deliver parts.
"Bringing a plant back up is much more difficult than taking it down," Bryce Currie, vice president of Americas manufacturing at Ford, said this month.
Workers at the Wayne plant, which makes the Ranger pickup and the Bronco sport-utility vehicle, had not received return-to-work orders on Thursday, but they expected to be back on the assembly line next week.
Walter Robinson, 57, has worked at the Wayne plant for 34 years and expects to retire by the end of the new contract. But he said three of his children work for Ford and would see a big benefit from the new terms.
"My daughter has only been here two years, and it was going to take years for her to get the top wage," he said. "This is going to help her immensely. This is going to make all of their lives better."

Not in U.A.W. But Still Part Of the Strike: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The three U.S. automakers say they are already at a disadvantage to nonunion rivals while labor leaders hope that big gains in negotiations will inspire workers in Southern states to unionize.
Tens of thousands of people who work for Toyota in Kentucky, Mercedes-Benz in Alabama or Tesla in Texas are technically not involved in the high-stakes negotiations taking place between labor and management in and around Detroit.
But they are very much a presence.
Executives at Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent of Chrysler, invoke nonunion automakers, many of them in the South, as a competitive threat that makes it impossible for them to meet striking workers' demands for big raises, more generous benefits and better working conditions.
"Toyota, Honda, Tesla and others are loving this strike because they know the longer it goes on, the better it is for them," Bill Ford, the executive chair of Ford Motor, said in Michigan last week. "They will win, and all of us will lose."
The United Automobile Workers union sees such statements as an attempt to play workers off one another. It views the strikes, entering their sixth week, as a first step toward better pay for not only U.A.W. members but also the nonunion workers that it plans to recruit in the future.
"We won't be used in this phony competition," Shawn Fain, the U.A.W. president, said on Friday, reacting to Mr. Ford's speech. He added, "Nonunion autoworkers are not the enemy. Those are our future union family."
The pay gap between union and nonunion factories has long been a point of contention. Some industry executives have argued that high union wages were a big reason G.M. and Chrysler had to resort to bankruptcy after the 2008 financial crisis.
Union leaders and progressive lawmakers have asserted that the growth of nonunion manufacturing, mostly in the South but also in the Midwest and West, has helped to erode the middle class over the past several decades.
Veteran union autoworkers tend to make more than production workers who are not represented by unions. They often have more say in their schedules and overtime work.
But starting pay at Ford, G.M. and Stellantis factories can be lower than at nonunion factories. And the pay of nonunion workers at Southern auto plants tends to go further because the cost of living there is lower than it is in the Midwest.
Even the geographic divide between union and nonunion plant is not always as clear as it may seem. Toyota and Honda have plants in the South, where unions are weak, but they also have factories in Ohio and Indiana, where unions are stronger. And G.M. and Ford have union operations in Kentucky, Tennessee and Texas.
The debate about auto industry wages has become more urgent as automakers invest billions to build factories that produce batteries for electric cars. Most of those factories are being built in Southern states, like Georgia and Tennessee, where local laws make it more difficult for unions to organize a factory.
"A good agreement with the Detroit Three would be powerful because it gives union organizers better arguments for joining the union," said Ian Greer, a Cornell research professor who studies the effect of electric vehicles on labor.
Even with a union wage of almost $ 32 an hour from her job assembling chassis at a Ford factory in Chicago, Schataan Lyke said she did not have it easy. She is the sole breadwinner for three children and worries about how to afford a prom dress for her oldest.
Ms. Lyke, who has been on strike, said she was glad to have the union behind her. "You've got someone on the outside fighting for you," she said.
But Ms. Lyke, 37, has it better than people doing similar work in the South. At a Nissan factory in Canton, Miss., Morris Mock, 49, makes about $ 1 less than Ms. Lyke per hour even with more than 20 years of experience, he said.
An attempt to unionize Nissan in 2017 failed to win enough support from workers. That means Mr. Mock, one of the people who led the union drive, will not benefit directly from the contract that the U.A.W. works out with automakers. But he said he was glad the union was fighting to protect wages as the industry switched to electric vehicles.
"The market is about to change," Mr. Mock said. "I'm glad that they understand that we must put workers first."
Government statistics suggest wide regional pay gaps. Michigan autoworkers make 22 percent more than production workers in Tennessee, 23 percent more than South Carolina workers and 28 percent more than Alabama workers, according to a Census Bureau survey. Those figures include people who work for suppliers, where pay is often lower than in factories that assemble vehicles.
Some labor experts said the bigger difference between union and nonunion autoworkers had less to do with pay and more with things like mandatory overtime and the scheduling of shifts. Union workers tend to have more say in those matters.
The auto industry has been moving South for decades, drawn by lower costs, weak unions and local government incentives. Foreign automakers have often chosen sites in the South when they set up factories in the United States. BMW and Volvo Cars have factories in South Carolina; Mercedes and Hyundai in Alabama; Toyota in Kentucky; and Volkswagen in Tennessee.
Most of the foreign automakers do not disclose what they pay their workers. Volkswagen, an exception, said the starting pay at its factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., was $ 21.10 for hourly production workers. Veteran workers earn more than $ 29, the company said.
Foreign automakers concentrated in the South sometimes pay their U.S. workers more than Ford, G.M. and Stellantis, according to a study by EY for Autos Drive America, an industry association that represents Nissan, Toyota, Mercedes and others.
The average starting wage at foreign automakers was $ 19 an hour, the survey said, more than the $ 17 starting wage for U.A.W. members. But the average maximum pay at the foreign automakers was $ 28, compared with $ 32 for U.A.W. members under the current contract.
A Nissan spokesman declined to say how much the company pays its U.S. workers, but he said the average was higher than that reported by the Autos Drive America survey.
Tesla, which is based in Texas and has factories there and in Buffalo; Fremont, Calif.; and Sparks, Nev., does not disclose what it pays its workers, but the Detroit automakers say it is less than what they pay.
Ford has said its labor costs, including benefits and bonuses, are 40 percent more per worker than Tesla's. That figure does not include stock awards that at least some Tesla employees receive. On Tesla's website, job advertisements for a production associate pay $ 20 to $ 23 an hour.
Even if autoworker pay in Alabama or Mississippi is less than what it is in Michigan or Illinois, it is often more than what employers in other industries pay in those places.
Working conditions are often a bigger issue than pay, labor representatives say.
In February, Emily Erickson of the University of Warwick in England and Berneece Herbert of Jackson State University published a survey of 211 workers at Mercedes's factory in Vance, Ala., near Tuscaloosa.
The workers reported earning an average of $ 27 an hour at Mercedes, high for the region. But they said they were forced to work overtime or change their work schedules with little notice. Almost half worked more than 50 hours a week. The study also found that white workers made an average of $ 3 more per hour than Black workers.
Mercedes denied that it discriminates. "Our pay structure is equal for all team members regardless of race, age or ethnic origin, and our pay progressions are based on seniority," the company said in a statement.
It noted that the company employed 6,000 people in Alabama, suggesting that the study sampled too few workers. "We do not agree with its conclusions," Mercedes said.
The gulf between pay in the South and the North is certain to widen when Ford, G.M. and Stellantis agree on new contracts with the U.A.W. The union is demanding a 40 percent increase over four years. Ford, G.M. and Stellantis have already offered raises of 23 percent and could go higher.
Unions have made some progress in the South recently. Workers at Blue Bird, which makes school buses in Georgia, voted to join the United Steelworkers in May and are negotiating a contract. Workers at ZF, which makes axles for Mercedes in Alabama, ended a monthlong strike last week after the German company agreed to raise the top hourly wage to $ 23.
Labor leaders say they have already been deluged with calls from workers at Toyota, Volkswagen and Hyundai who expressed interest in organizing unions. Workers at Volkswagen voted not to join the union in 2019, but the environment may be different this time.
"These workers will say, 'Look what the U.A.W. did for these workers at G.M., Ford and Stellantis,"' said Tim Smith, director of U.A.W. Region 8, which includes all of the Southeast.
"We've got organizers on the ground there right now," he said. "We're starting to make our move."

Tesla Profit Plunges 44% As Musk Cites Challenges: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The automaker reported a sharp drop in profits in the third quarter after slashing car prices by around 25 percent in an attempt to compete.
Tesla's profit slumped in the third quarter, disappointing Wall Street expectations, after the carmaker cut prices to maintain its dominance of the market for electric vehicles.
Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, also dashed hopes that a new model called the Cybertruck would quickly revive earnings, warning that the pickup truck would take at least 18 months to become profitable after it goes on sale at the end of November.
The company reported a net profit of $ 1.9 billion from July through September, a 44 percent drop from the $ 3.3 billion Tesla made in the same three-month period a year earlier.
Saying he wanted to "temper expectations," Mr. Musk warned on Wednesday during a conference call with financial analysts and investors that "there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with Cybertruck and making the Cybertruck cash flow positive."
He added, "The blood, sweat and tears that will be required to achieve that is just staggering."
The company has slashed car prices by around 25 percent in the United States during the last year, putting the priority on sales rather than profit. The least expensive version of Tesla's best selling car, the Model Y sport-utility vehicle, now starts at $ 44,000 before government incentives, or roughly as much as the comparable Toyota RAV4 Prime plug-in hybrid, which has an electric motor and a gasoline engine.
"We continue to believe that an industry leader needs to be a cost leader," Tesla said in a statement.
Despite the cuts, Tesla's share of the electric vehicle market in the United States slumped to 50 percent in the third quarter from 60 percent in the first quarter, according to Kelley Blue Book. BMW, Mercedes, Hyundai, General Motors and other automakers have been introducing new electric vehicles at a rapid clip, eroding Tesla's dominance.
Tesla is also facing stiffer competition in China and Europe, two large markets for battery-powered cars, from local automakers.
Analysts had expected a decline in profit after Tesla said earlier this month that sales fell in the third quarter because of temporary factory shutdowns to retool assembly lines at factories in Austin, Texas, and Shanghai. But the slump was greater than expected.
At least until recently, Tesla was more profitable than established U.S. automakers, allowing it to cut prices. "I view it as a way to defend market share at the expense of margin," said Kevin Roberts, director of industry insights and analytics at CarGurus, an online auto sales site.
The company may not be able to continue cutting prices indefinitely. Its net profit margin in the third quarter was 8 percent, in line with that of traditional carmakers.
Investors had been hoping that the Cybertruck pickup would revive sales. The company said Wednesday that it expected to begin deliveries of the vehicle on Nov. 30, two years behind schedule.
Mr. Musk acknowledged that Tesla was facing severe challenges mass producing the vehicle, which has an unusual stainless-steel body. The material resists rust and does not need to be painted, but is much more difficult to shape and weld.
"We dug our own grave with Cybertruck," Mr. Musk said.
Ford Motor, Rivian and General Motors have reported lackluster sales of electric pickup trucks after an initial surge in customer interest, suggesting that the market for such vehicles may not be quite as big as industry executives and analysts had once thought. This week, G.M. said it would delay by a year plans to start producing electric pickups at a factory in Michigan, and Ford said it was slowing production of its F-150 Lightning truck.
Mr. Musk insisted that demand for the Cybertruck was "off the charts" and that more than one million people have placed orders. But he noted that higher interest rates have led to higher monthly loan payments, reducing consumers' ability to buy new cars.
"We have to make it at a price that people can afford," he said.
Tesla could benefit if the United Automobile Workers strike against Ford, G.M. and Stellantis expands to more factories. So far, workers at six plants owned by the three companies have walked off the job. Tesla workers do not belong to a union.
Tesla's stock price, which fell nearly 5 percent in regular trading on Wednesday, was down another 3 percent in extended trading after Mr. Musk's conference call.
"I'm not saying things will be bad," he said of the economy, "but I'm saying they might be."

LinkedIn to Cut 668 Jobs
In 2nd Round This Year
LinkedIn, the professional social networking platform owned by Microsoft, said on Monday that it would cut about 668 jobs, or roughly 3 percent of its work force.
The layoffs, which affect LinkedIn's engineering, product, talent and finance teams, are the second round this year. In May, LinkedIn laid off 716 employees worldwide and said it was reducing its business in China, citing declining demand.
LinkedIn, which has 19,500 employees across 36 offices globally, did not detail the reasons for the job cuts on Monday.
In July, LinkedIn said its revenue for the three months that ended in June had grown 5 percent from a year earlier, with annual revenue surpassing $ 15 billion for the first time. The rise was driven by its recruiting business, according to Microsoft. LinkedIn has 950 million users, a number that has increased for eight consecutive quarters. YIWEN LU

G.M. Delays Production
Of Electric Pickup Truck
General Motors will delay electric pickup truck production at a factory near Detroit because of slowing U.S. demand for electric vehicles, to better manage its capital investments and to make some engineering changes.
The company said in a statement Tuesday that the factory in Orion Township, Mich., will start making electric Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups in late 2025, instead of next year.
G.M. spokesman Kevin Kelly said the change had nothing to do with the ongoing four-week partial strike by members of the United Auto Workers union. He said the company wanted to make engineering changes that would improve the trucks' profitability.
About 1,000 workers at the Orion plant will keep building the Chevrolet Bolt hatchback small electric car and Bolt electric utility vehicle through the end of this year as planned, the company said. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Rolls-Royce Overhaul
Will Mean 2,500 Layoffs
The jet engine maker Rolls-Royce said Tuesday it would cut up to 2,500 jobs globally as part of a corporate overhaul that its new chief executive is carrying out.
The aerospace company was hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic that decimated demand for air travel. Tufan Erginbilgic, who took over as chief executive in January, said the layoffs were aimed at making Rolls-Royce "more streamlined and efficient."
Rolls-Royce, based in Britain, did not disclose where jobs would be cut, but around half of its 42,000-person work force is based in the United Kingdom.
The company slashed 9,000 jobs globally in 2020 as it grappled with the collapse of air travel during the pandemic.
The turnaround plan also includes creating a new companywide procurement division that can take advantage of Rolls-Royce's size to cut costs and reduce supply chain delays.

The Rise of Tech, According to Sandra Bullock Movies: [Style Desk]

Full text: A completely correct theory, in which one of our greatest movie stars reveals humanity's changing relationship to modernity.
At some point in the future, the sentient beings running the planet may want to study how the humans dealt with the technological revolution of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.
After they have ingested the pertinent scholarly essays and news reports, they will have a pretty good idea of how we managed the shift to a world increasingly driven by machines. And that might be enough.
But why stop at enough when they might deepen their understanding by looking into something that might seem irrelevant at first glance: the films of Sandra Bullock, one of the biggest stars of the transitional period.
Ms. Bullock had the good or bad fortune to have been born in 1964, meaning she was young enough to adapt to tech culture when it came along but old enough to mourn the passing of the environment that had shaped her.
Her movies are time capsules that preserve the look and feel of discrete moments in tech, some of them all but forgotten. When you find yourself watching the 2002 romantic comedy "Two Weeks Notice" on this or that streaming platform, you can't help but fixate on the clamshell phone that Hugh Grant uses to call Ms. Bullock from a bar at 2:15 a.m.
Or maybe you're caught up in "The Proposal," a 2009 comedy in which she plays a New York publishing boss, and you're momentarily thrown from the story when our heroine, far from home and without a laptop, steps into an internet cafe to send an email. You pause to consider the fate of those little establishments, which once seemed to be everywhere and are now ... gone?
Team Analog
Ms. Bullock became a star thanks to her knack for playing a quirky Everywoman whose secret strength comes to the fore when she is put to the test. You underestimate a Sandra Bullock character at your peril. Like Jimmy Stewart for earlier generations of moviegoers, she is a gloriously imperfect stand-in for you and me.
All kinds of social issues crop up in her movies, but a consistent through line is how we have grappled, often fumblingly, with technological change. Ms. Bullock's onscreen relationship to tech is thus quite unlike that of a fellow box-office champ from the same period, Tom Cruise, whose more obviously heroic characters demonstrate a slick command of advanced gadgetry in the "Top Gun" and "Mission: Impossible" blockbusters.
Ms. Bullock made her breakthrough in "Speed," playing an office worker, Annie Porter, who ends up behind the wheel of a Los Angeles city bus that is rigged to blow up if its speed dips below 50 miles per hour. The movie was a hit thanks to its catchy premise and the felicitous pairing of Ms. Bullock and Keanu Reeves, who plays a serene bomb-disposal officer, Jack Traven.
The crashes, explosions and flirtatious repartee camouflage the fact that "Speed" is, at its heart, an analog-versus-digital fable. Along the course of an action-packed morning, Annie and Jack make use of soon-to-be-outdated technological tools to vanquish a madman who relies on state-of-the-art gizmos.
In 1994, when "Speed" was a summertime blockbuster, roughly 31 percent of households in the United States had a computer, and a majority of people who gained access to the internet paid dearly for each online minute as their modems hissed.
This was the toddlerhood of digital tech, when many Americans seemed put off by the World Wide Web's rambunctious arrival on the scene. "What is internet, anyway?" the "Today" show co-anchor Bryant Gumbel asked in an exasperated tone during a 1994 broadcast segment that has since gone viral.
When the villain of "Speed," played by Dennis Hopper, lays out his plan, he does so while speaking on a cellphone. His lair includes several televisions, as well as an internet-enabled computer allowing him to track the bus's location and speed. One of his TVs displays a live security-camera feed of Annie, Jack and the passengers.
To show he means business, the Hopper character kills a hostage by detonating an explosive device via remote control from his apartment. Seconds later, his eyes glued to a TV news report of the fatality, he delivers a line suggesting that, in the world of "Speed," evil and tech innovations go hand in hand: "Interactive TV, Jack! Wave of the future!"
But he has a weakness that can be exploited by those skilled in the old ways. The police cobble together a 60-second video of the security-cam footage and play it on a loop as Annie and Jack help carry out a high-speed evacuation of the bus. When the villain realizes he has been duped by mere VHS trickery, he lets out a howl. Human ingenuity, aided by good old analog tech, has saved the day.
Ms. Bullock's next action movie, "The Net," released in 1995, had a prescient focus on identity theft and the overreach of Silicon Valley, subject matter that made an impression on audiences and critics of the time. "Do You Exist if the Internet Erases You?" The New York Times asked in the review's headline.
At the film's start, Ms. Bullock's character, a computer programmer, is at ease with the new tech and its attendant culture. She works from home, making her perhaps the first film protagonist to be a remote employee in the current sense of the term. She has online buddies, like Cyberbob and Iceman, and she's skilled enough in the ways of the internet to pull off something that seemed novel at the time: ordering a pizza online. The camera lingers on the process, lending the scene the feel of an instructional film.
The rest adds up to a cautionary tale. In "The Net," even the web's natives suspect that their way of life may lead to a fraying of the ties that bind the human community. "No one leaves the house anymore," Iceman says in an online chat. "No one has sex. The Net is ultimate condom." Ms. Bullock's character replies: "Talk like that, Iceman, could lead to the eventual extinction of our species."
She soon stumbles onto a software virus hatched by a ruthless tech company. When she starts investigating, all records of her identity are deleted, and she is listed in government databases as a terrorist.
She realizes her online skills will not help her overcome the villain, a stylish tech bro. Her only recourse is to go full analog: In the climactic sequence, she bonks him on his genius head, twice, with a fire extinguisher. As in "Speed," the old order, with Ms. Bullock as its champion, is restored -- and our high-tech future is put off for another day.
Enter the Multitasker
In the mid-'90s, most people could get through the day just fine without a lot of personal tech. So audiences didn't particularly notice that cellphones and laptops had no role in Ms. Bullock's other film of 1995, "While You Were Sleeping."
The heroine, a humble token-booth employee who lives with her cat, has a crush on one of her regular customers, a handsome businessman played by Peter Gallagher. When he is shoved onto the train tracks, she saves his life. At the hospital, where he spends days in an attractive coma, she allows the staff to believe she is his fiancée. The film becomes a love-triangle comedy with the arrival of the patient's brother, a carpenter played by Bill Pullman.
To learn about the hunky coma patient, Ms. Bullock's character goes through his personal effects. She finds a wallet that includes photographs of himself (conceited much?) and a proximity key fob for a BMW, a gadget that was starting to become standard issue for luxury cars in the '90s. It is the only significant tech device in this throwback tale and helps form a portrait of her crush as a shallow guy.
The Pullman character, by contrast, wears flannel shirts and drives an old pickup. He is also is onto her ruse. In a parking garage, she's holding the fob when he zings her with questions to test her knowledge of his brother and suggests that she has no idea where the BMW is parked. He's right about that -- but when she presses a button, a nearby car chirps, allowing her to continue her playacting and postpone the moment when she and the salt-of-the-earth carpenter can acknowledge their love for each other.
In the next decade, tech devices became an almost unnoticed part of the cinematic furniture, and the onscreen Ms. Bullock allows them into her life with mixed results. In "28 Days," a 2000 film about an alcoholic, her character is headed for rock bottom when she commandeers a limo while drunk. Holding a Sony cellphone to her ear, she narrowly avoids several collisions before plowing into a house. At the time of filming, Westchester County, where the scene takes place, was considering a law banning the use of hand-held cellphones on the road.
The 2000 blockbuster "Miss Congeniality" stars Ms. Bullock as Gracie Hart, a shoot-first-ask-questions-later F.B.I. agent who goes undercover at a beauty pageant. At the time of its release, just over 50 percent of American adults used the internet, according to Pew Research Center, and the fledgling web is integral to the film's plot.
In an early scene, Agent Hart's colleagues are trying to find "a female F.B.I. agent under age 35," as one character puts it, who can pose as a pageant contestant. Sitting near a row of bulky computers, this group of mostly male agents, along with our gum-chewing heroine, visits a website, Dress Up Sally, that offers simulations of what various people would look like in swimsuits and gowns. The cut-and-paste images on the screen are a long way from today's deepfakes, but enough to excite the men in the room.
As various women are put through the internet wringer, the group grows raucous. Agent Hart looks on, blank-faced. In "Miss Congeniality," the web is not so much a game-changing technology as it is the plaything of adolescent-minded men in positions of authority. The scene makes plain that Agent Hart faces a twofold challenge: In addition to nailing the culprit, she must navigate a world steeped in sexism, one that the internet seems likely to exacerbate.
By the time of the 2005 sequel, "Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous," the web has become more useful to her, as it had to the 36 million Americans who were using computers to download movies and songs. Agent Hart is now the owner of a pearly white iBook G4 laptop, a machine considerably thicker than the MacBooks of today. It was part of a line that Apple put out from 2003 to 2005, when its products had become status symbols.
In this time of tech optimism, a visit to a bright, clean Apple store was a trip to retail heaven, rather than a loathsome errand. "Miss Congeniality 2" matches the moment in having Agent Hart solve the case by using her iBook to analyze footage that shows the kidnappers snatching the victims from a sidewalk.
The scene of her watching the video while lounging in bed also provides a rose-hued illustration of the enmeshment of digital devices with our private lives.
But tech's tendency to worm its way into intimate moments is not always such a wonderful thing. In the 2009 comedy "All About Steve," Ms. Bullock plays a socially awkward person who relies on pen and paper in her job as crossword puzzle maker for The Sacramento Herald. When she goes on a blind date with a cable news cameraman played by Bradley Cooper, it is love at first sight, at least from her perspective.
She lunges at him moments after laying eyes on him, announcing, "I am going to eat you like a mountain lion!" That's when tech enters the story, to her detriment, in the form of a vibrating cellphone. The man takes a slim device from his pocket before telling her he must go, because of a breaking news story.
In "The Blind Side," the 2009 film that gave Ms. Bullock her best actress Oscar, she plays Leigh Anne Tuohy, a no-nonsense interior decorator, businesswoman and mother in Memphis, Tenn., who takes into her home a Black teenager who has survived poverty and abuse and helps guide him to a college football scholarship.
Tech is prominent in Ms. Tuohy's grand entrance. The camera tracks her as she strides through a crowd on the way to her daughter's volleyball game while conducting a work call on her cell. The image she projects, with the help of the prop at her ear, is that of the 21st-century multitasker, someone who is physically present but mentally elsewhere, someone who is too big for the room.
Back to Nature
Ms. Bullock battled most valiantly against technology in "Gravity," a 2013 film about a space shuttle mission gone wrong. She plays Ryan Stone, a biomedical engineer on her first trip beyond the stratosphere. Her job is to equip the Hubble Space Telescope with an X-ray imaging device of her own design.
She is experiencing severe motion sickness as she tries to perform her task. Disaster strikes when explosions rumbles through the satellite belt. Shortly before the fast-moving debris destroys the shuttle, the lead astronaut, a cheerful sort played by George Clooney, takes a moment to gaze upon Earth. "Half of North America just lost their Facebook," he says.
He dies soon afterward, leaving Dr. Stone alone in the vastness of space. She must summon the will to go on while figuring out how to fly two small spacecrafts. If she cannot master the tech, she will die.
Her prospects seem dim as she struggles to make sense of a jargon-heavy manual. She hits a low point when the second spacecraft runs out of fuel. She shuts all systems down and gives up.
In the profound silence, she realizes she might be able to use the landing thrusters to propel herself toward Earth's atmosphere. She decides to give it a try but has no idea which button to push. "Eenie, meenie, minie, moe," she says, before landing on her choice.
After she crash-lands in a lake, the film ends with what will become something of a trope in Sandra Bullock movies: a shot of her in a lush natural setting. Filmed from below in the final moment of "Gravity," she looks powerful, like a new Eve, as she walks into the green surroundings.
In "Bird Box," a 2018 film about an unexplained apocalyptic event and its aftermath, countless people commit suicide when they see something in front of them. An early victim is a young woman who is shown talking on a smartphone; the next time we see her, she is bashing her head into a glass wall. Did her death have something to do with the smartphone? An evil meme, perhaps? That would make sense for a film that came out when techno-optimism had soured amid the rise of bot farms, spyware and the social-media-assisted spread of conspiracy theories.
The "Bird Box" protagonist forms a bond with survivors who have holed up in a house. Digital tech becomes crucial to them when they take a car to the supermarket: Because they cannot look at the outside world, they black out the windows and rely on GPS to navigate the corpse-ridden streets. Later, Ms. Bullock squires her two children through wild terrain unaided by any device. She finds her reward in an idyllic settlement deep in a forest. She has moved from the tech-strewn 21st century to a setting reminiscent of "A Midsummer Night's Dream."
"The Lost City" follows a similar arc. In this 2022 action-adventure comedy, Ms. Bullock plays a widowed romance novelist who has the mind-set of an academic. Attempting a comeback after years away from the scene, she finds that the publishing industry has changed in her absence, thanks to the rise of social media. Image now trumps content, and her fans are more interested in the model who poses for her book covers, played by Channing Tatum, than the author herself.
She is less than pleased when her editor introduces her to an extremely online young woman who will be her social media manager. "She's going to be helping us target that younger demographic," the editor says, "meaning women in their 30s who wish they were in their 20s." Cue Bullock eye roll.
She is soon kidnapped and whisked to a remote island. And so a film that begins in the world of smartphones and social media ends up in a place that smacks of the jungle serials popular nearly a century ago. In the 2020s, this counts as an attractive fantasy.
With tech no longer seen as a part of the solution, "The Lost City" concludes with Ms. Bullock and Mr. Tatum on a tropical beach. They are locked in a kiss, as far as you can get from the digital life.

More Cars, Fewer Spots: Parking in New York Gets Harder: [National Desk]

Full text: There are more cars but fewer available spots on the street. There are fewer garages -- and exorbitant prices. For city drivers, it's a growing headache.
After his shift at his limo company ended one night this year, Arben Elezi called his wife to tell her he would be home as soon as he found a parking spot. Hours later, she called him, frantic -- he was still not back. He told her to look out the window of their Upper West Side apartment.
Mr. Elezi had searched fruitlessly for a spot for so many hours that he had fallen asleep, double parked, out front.
"It is a daily struggle to find parking," Mr. Elezi said on a recent morning as he guarded his 2002 Mercedes against parking tickets during alternate side parking hours on Riverside Drive. "It takes away a lot of the quality of life."
New Yorkers have long groused about finding -- and paying for -- places to leave their cars. But now, inflation, the housing crisis and post-pandemic aftershocks have made what was already an urban blood sport nearly untenable. Drivers who find themselves priced out of expensive-as-rent garages are forced to hunt for parking spots increasingly crowded out by dumpsters, dining sheds, bike lanes and a glut of cars. This past fiscal year, the police issued 8.4 million tickets, one of the highest totals on record.
No, you're not imagining it: Parking in New York City is worse than ever.
Topping the list of reasons is the sheer number of cars: There are over 2.2 million registered in New York City, according to the Department of Motor Vehicles, and many more that drive into the city each day from elsewhere. Many of them are now vying for the city's roughly three million free parking spots.
Competing for space by the curb are delivery hubs, bikes and dining sheds, which have chewed away at an estimated 8,000 of the city's free street side parking spaces. There are now about 2,000 CitiBike bicycle rental docks, and counting. A study of the feasibility of installing rat-resistant garbage dumpsters by the Department of Sanitation showed such containers could claim another 150,000 spaces if implemented.
There is also a peculiarly New York parking conundrum: So much of the city's street parking is free (and meter parking is relatively cheap) that drivers park and just stay put, said Rachel Weinberger, the director of research strategy at Regional Plan Association; cars are not incentivized to budge. This month, the city will roll out higher meter prices, beginning in Manhattan, to induce turnover. "It helps people share better," Ms. Weinberger, said.
All this parking trouble comes at a time when there is an active effort to shrink the number of cars in New York because they contribute so much to climate change. Transit and environmental advocates argue that parking in the city -- in garages and on public streets -- should be expensive, partly as an incentive to keep people from driving in the first place.
For those desperately in search of a place to leave their cars, the pain is felt citywide. But its apex is perennially car-stuffed Manhattan, where garage parking is the most expensive in the country -- on average $ 441 per month -- according to a recent study of nearly 40 big U.S. cities by FINN, a subscription car leasing company. (That's about what you'd pay for 20 months of parking in Tulsa, Okla., the country's cheapest, according to the findings.) The Upper West Side's garages are the most expensive of all, it found, averaging $ 650 a month.
On top of all that, with city real estate at a premium, many parking garages have vanished, scooped up by developers and converted into apartments. The scarcity appears to have driven up garage prices, drivers say; many even have wait-lists.
In the Bronx, Abdoulaye Kabre, 45, an Instacart deliveryman, found the holy grail last year: a $ 200-per-month garage space right near his house. A friend was moving out of town and bequeathed her spot to him. Before that, he said, some nights when he couldn't find a street spot, he slept in his car. "You don't have a choice," Mr. Kabre said.
And there may soon be even fewer off-street options: Mayor Eric Adams recently introduced a plan to address the city's affordable housing crisis that included easing a requirement that all new developments include parking.
City Hall was quick to stress that parking is not under attack; rather, the use of curbs has evolved in recent years. "This is a vision where local businesses can access goods and welcome customers, where those who need to park cars can do so, and where the majority of New Yorkers and vast majority of Manhattanites who do not own personal cars can take advantage of the largest public bike share and the best public transit system in the nation," said a spokesman for the mayor's office, Charles Kretchmer Lutvak.
Every so often, Dutch Benendez, 56, who said he is a disabled veteran and works as a street vendor, drives his cherry red Chevrolet HHR into garages near where he lives on West 85th Street. "I'll pretend I'm looking for a spot just to see what the prices are," he says. He inevitably drives right back out. On West 90th Street at a garage run by SP Plus Corporation, for example, parking a midsize car costs $ 844.77 a month -- with tax, that's $ 1,000 -- about half of Mr. Benendez's monthly earnings, he said.
Hunting for spots, or waiting out alternate side parking -- when drivers must move their cars to make way for street cleaners or risk a ticket -- has frequently made him late for work, he said. Often, he can only find parking 30 blocks away from his home. "Sometimes I take the bus home from where I've found a spot," Mr. Benendez said.
This past year, the New York State Senate floated a proposal for residential parking permits in New York City, a plan that would essentially set aside certain parking spots for people who live in the neighborhood. It is a perennial topic of discussion that may gain more traction as congestion pricing -- charging steep fees to commuters driving into certain parts of the city -- becomes a reality. That's because some fear that commuters will park on streets outside of the congestion zones, gobbling up more of a precious resource.
"Anybody can park for free on our New York City streets," said Renee Baruch, a retired corporate lawyer who started a lobbying group, NYC Resident Parking, to push for the permits. "Which is bizarre."
Some New Yorkers, like Malcolm Fox, 58, have done the math and figured that getting a $ 65 alternate side parking ticket every so often is far cheaper than garaging a car where he lives on the Upper West Side. Balancing life and parking means Mr. Fox finds about two orange slips under his windshield a month, he said, when he doesn't have time to move his BMW for the street sweeper.
"I take it all in my stride, because it's cheap to park in New York for just 120 or so dollars," Mr. Fox said. "It's an easy choice to make."
That calculus may be why the police wrote a flurry of parking tickets this past fiscal year, summonses that could total over $ 724 million, according to an analysis of Department of Finance data by the New York City Comptroller's office.
But not everyone is paying up: In 2021, the total amount of money in outstanding parking tickets increased by one-third -- drivers owe a total of $ 911 million -- according to data from the Comptroller's annual report; the next year it rose by more than 20 percent, to $ 1.1 billion. The number of new fines increased by 15 percent each year of those years, the report said.
In June, Lincoln Restler, a New York City councilman and Democrat from Brooklyn, introduced legislation that ratchets up the penalty for each subsequent ticket; more than three strikes a year could result in a tow.
The councilman does not have a car, he said. "But I am sympathetic to everybody who struggles with it."

Used E.V.s Becoming A Good Deal: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The prices of used battery-powered models have fallen sharply, as the supply of cars and trucks has improved.
If you're in the market for an electric vehicle, the time might be right to consider a used one.
The high cost of electric vehicles has long dissuaded many people from buying one. Last year, for example, electric cars and trucks were so popular and supply so limited that waiting lists were common. And some lucky individuals found they could sell their ride for more than they paid for it.
But over the past year, prices of used electric vehicles have fallen significantly. In addition, climate legislation passed in 2022 includes a tax credit to encourage more people to buy used electric cars and trucks.
Auto inflation has eased
Used cars as a whole are around 7 percent less expensive than they were a year ago, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But used battery-powered models are 28 percent less expensive than a year ago, according to Recurrent, a research firm that specializes in the used electric vehicle market.
Shortages of new cars during the pandemic made new and used cars more expensive, as strong demand for new vehicles spilled over into the used market. Now, supply chains and inventories have improved, and new electric vehicles -- and new cars generally -- have become more available.
Tesla, which sells most new electric cars, has cut prices several times this year to attract buyers, forcing other automakers to lower prices and offer promotions. Those cuts have helped to push down used car prices.
Some analysts think used electric car prices could fall further, though perhaps not as fast. Higher interest rates and a strong supply of new vehicles ought to continue driving prices down, according to J.D. Power, a market research firm.
Are electric cars a bad investment?
Most cars depreciate over time. That said, electric cars and trucks are holding their value better today than they did before the pandemic. That's because there are more places to charge these cars and people have become more familiar with them, said David Paris, director of market intelligence at J.D. Power Valuation Services.
If you bought, say, a used BMW i3 in 2019, Mr. Paris said, it retained only around 30 percent of the manufacturer's suggested retail prices after three years. But now the i3 retains more than 50 percent of its value, suggesting that buyers have fewer concerns about the cars and specifically the health of their batteries, the most expensive part of those vehicles.
Liz Najman, a researcher at Recurrent, said most used electric cars were still new enough that their batteries should be covered under warranty. "Most used E.V.s in the country have at least an eight year, 100,000-mile warranty on their battery," she said.
You should still check the health of a car's battery before buying because replacing it can be expensive. Recurrent provides reports on the health of a car's battery, and apps like Leaf Spy and MyGreenVolt allow car owners to monitor their batteries, depending on the model.
You might be eligible for a tax credit
The Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden's climate bill, grants a tax credit of up to $ 4,000 for buying used electric vehicles that cost no more than $ 25,000.
The credit is available to individuals who earn up to $ 75,000 a year and couples who make $ 150,000 or less. According to Recurrent, around 27 percent of the used electric car inventory is eligible for the credit, up from 17 percent last year.
To qualify, a used vehicle has to be at least two years old. Buyers cannot claim the credit more than once every three years. But, unlike with the tax credits for new vehicles, there are no restrictions on where a used electric vehicle is assembled or where the materials in its batteries come from.
More options are available
Before the pandemic, some of the most popular electric vehicles had been on the road for only a few years at most. Among the few electric models often found on the used car lot, many were luxury models like the Tesla Model S, a large sedan, or the Tesla Model X, a three-row sport-utility vehicle.
The market is much bigger and more diverse now. The number of used electric cars for sale has tripled over the past year, according to Recurrent. A recent scroll through used car listings in the New York area showed a wide range of cars, including a Porsche Taycan listed for more than $ 80,000 and Chevrolet, Hyundai and Nissan models selling for less than $ 25,000.
Buying a used electric vehicle might not be right for everyone, especially if you have to drive long distances or live somewhere where charging stations are few and far between. But if you have a place to plug in and don't frequently drive several hundred miles a day, you can get a good deal.

Why Electric Vehicles Are a Favorite Scapegoat for Republican Candidates: [National Desk]

Full text: The industry's transition to battery power is already underway. Republican presidential candidates are pushing to reverse course.
Fresh off a walking tour of blighted Flint, Mich., on Wednesday, Vivek Ramaswamy spoke excitedly about a comeback for the "forgotten America" that he has made a part of his long-shot bid for the presidency.
He wasn't promising that the automakers that had largely abandoned Flint would return. "We have opportunities, though, to look to the future of a lot that we need to bring to this country," Mr. Ramaswamy, a 38-year-old entrepreneur, said, ticking through the industries that he'd like to see help drive a revival: semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, defense production.
The industry he doesn't want involved is the one already pouring money into the state: electric vehicles. He attributes the investments and the rising popularity of the cars to tax credits and favorable regulations that he would reverse as president.
"That's not only a market distortion, but a market distortion that is decidedly a step in an anti-American direction that I think is frankly dangerous to the future of the country," he told reporters just outside Flint.
Mr. Ramaswamy's enmity toward electric cars, extolled in the ancestral home of the American automobile, does not exactly set him apart in the presidential field. The front-runner for the Republican nomination, Donald J. Trump, was in Michigan last week, reeling off a rambling bill of particulars against E.V.s, complaining falsely that they run out of power in 15 minutes, are bad for the environment, and would destroy the domestic auto industry within a few short years.
Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, a distant second to Mr. Trump in national polls, recently railed against electric vehicles when he unveiled an energy policy platform that promised to roll back E.V. subsidies to "support Americans' right to drive the cars they want." Mike Pence, Mr. Trump's former vice president-turned-competitor, agrees with Mr. Ramaswamy and others that the transition to electric vehicles would send American auto manufacturing to China.
Opposing electric cars -- and the industry's ongoing shift away from internal-combustion engines to battery power -- allows Republican candidates to criticize China, the dominant economic force in the battery industry. It also pleases G.O.P. voters still hostile to the notion of climate change -- what Mr. Ramaswamy disparaged Wednesday night as "that God-forsaken religion, the climate cult" and "the E.V. subsidy cult" -- and to all things environmental and "woke." And it evokes a nostalgic halcyon past, the same one that Mr. Trump conjured when he promised in 2016 to bring back coal mines, steel mills and basic manufacturing.
But the steel mills and coal mines failed to roar back to their glory days, and the internal-combustion engine is unlikely to as well. In fact, the electric vehicle transition is well underway.
That transition is driven in part by President Biden's policies, which subsidize the manufacturing and purchasing of E.V.s and their components and impose strict fuel economy standards on automakers that can be met with zero-emission electric cars. But it's also motivated by Detroit executives who have vowed to convert their corporations to all electric, by consumers reacting to environmental concerns and gas prices, and by aggressive policies from governments like those of California, Britain and Europe that are beyond the reach of a Republican White House.
Those forces have prompted hundreds of billions of dollars to pour into states like Michigan and Ohio, but also to Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama and Tennessee, to assemble electric vehicles and build batteries and other parts with the warm embrace of Republican governors.
"The free market and consumer demand should drive the automobile manufacturing industry like it has here in Georgia, creating thousands of high-paying E.V. jobs across our state because of Georgia's first-class business environment, unmatched work force and strong logistics network," Georgia's governor, Brian Kemp, said in a statement this week. "The path to America leading industrial innovation in the 21st century is through Republican-led states."
But Republican presidential candidates say that, if elected, they will eliminate Mr. Biden's tax incentives to build and buy electric cars and trucks, and roll back his fuel efficiency standards aimed at sharply reducing climate-warming greenhouse gases.
"I support letting people choose the cars that they want without those perverse incentives and the tax code that suggests that buying an electric vehicle is somehow in the owner's best interest," Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina said, though such incentives have helped prompt BMW, Volvo and Mercedes-Benz to expand E.V. operations in his state.
The Republican Party's attacks on E.V.s. stem in part from real concerns shared by the auto industry and foreign policymakers. China does dominate battery-making, and as lithium-ion battery imports soar -- they were up 99 percent last year from 2021 -- a weakening Chinese domestic economy is bolstered abroad.
In Green Charter Township, Mich., where Gotion, a Chinese subsidiary, plans to build a battery plant, Mr. Ramaswamy showed up Wednesday evening at a horse farm dotted with signs reading "No Go on Gotion." Alongside promises to "make sure that God-forsaken plant never gets built," he criticized the "electric vehicle subsidy cult," which, he said to cheers, "will end on my watch as your next president."
"If you want to buy an E.V., I'm fine with that -- we don't need to use our taxpayer dollars to subsidize it," Mr. Ramaswamy said, declaring that subsidies involve "subsidizing the C.C.P. because those E.V.s require batteries made in China -- now made by China across the street from here," a reference to the Chinese Communist Party.
And some attendees agreed.
"I don't have a problem with electric vehicles -- if you want one, OK, cool, buy one. But don't force me, because I got a Dodge Ram with a Hemi and I love it," Randy Guppy, from Howard City, Mich., said, referring to a type of V-8 engine.
John Bozzella, president of the auto industry's Alliance for Automotive Innovation, also fretted that the Biden administration's aggressive push for electrification was driving the auto industry faster than suppliers could ramp up battery production, strengthening China's hand -- and possibly opening the domestic market to cheap Chinese electric cars.
And electric vehicles do take fewer workers to assemble than internal-combustion vehicles, driving labor unrest and Democratic political worries.
But the notion that electric vehicles are economically out of reach, technically infeasible and will somehow cripple domestic auto production and shift manufacturing to China appears belied by what is actually happening. This spring, fully electric vehicle sales reached 7.2 percent of all car and light-truck sales, a 48.4 percent increase over the year before and on a trajectory that analysts believe will only accelerate, according to Cox Automotive. U.S. consumers chose from 103 different models of cars, pickup trucks, S.U.V.s and vans.
The automotive industry said the average cost of an E.V. fell this year by $ 10,700, to $ 54,300 -- $ 5,800 more than the overall average cost of cars and light trucks in the country.
Some 77 percent of all E.V.s sold in the United States were produced in North America -- almost 60 percent from Tesla, owned by Republican-friendly Elon Musk. The rest were from Japan, Europe and South Korea. More than 660,000 electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids were sold in the United States in the first half of this year, by the industry's count; only a few thousand were from China, and that number actually declined, according to automotive analysts.
Money is pouring in. Around $ 115 billion has been pledged to build vehicles, batteries and components in the United States, much of that in Michigan and the Southeast. Georgia, a key swing state in 2024, has seen $ 25.1 billion in pledged investment alone, said Garrison Douglas, a spokesman for Governor Kemp.
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that employment in the industry will rise by more than 8.3 million by 2031, and while employment for basic assembly-line workers will decline by 96,000, higher wage jobs in engineering, software development and electronic assembly will shoot upward.
Earlier this year, Gov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia, a Republican, blocked Ford from considering his state for a new battery factory, saying he was worried that the automaker was being used "as a front for China," which would have controlled much of the plant's technology. Ford then moved its $ 3.5 billion investment to Marshall, Mich.
Stacey LaRouche, a spokeswoman for Gretchen Whitmer, Michigan's Democratic governor, talked up such investment on Wednesday, as Toyota and LG Energy Systems were announcing a $ 3 billion expansion of LG's battery plant in Holland, Mich., to power Toyota E.V.s built in Kentucky.
Electric vehicle and battery deals, she said, "are creating thousands of good paying jobs right here in Michigan, not overseas."

Full text: 'Chopped & Screwed'
Through Oct. 28. White Cube, 1002 Madison Avenue, Manhattan; whitecube.com.
The entry of an established international gallery like White Cube into New York, its sixth city after Paris, Hong Kong, West Palm Beach, Seoul and its native London, can't help feeling like a show of force. "Chopped & Screwed," the inaugural exhibition, installs work by marquee names -- Mark Bradford, Adrian Piper, Georg Baselitz, Julie Mehretu -- around a sumptuously renovated former bank building on Madison Avenue, and there's a chromed-out BMW motorcycle in the middle of the floor.
But Courtney Willis Blair, who curated the show, finds plenty of thought-provoking moments among the heavy names. The motorcycle, titled "The Lover, off the road (after Barbara)," is Tiona Nekkia McClodden's tribute to the filmmaker Barbara Hammer, who was forced to sell her own bike, Blair says, toward the end of her life. Danh Vo's bronze cast of a 16th-century Christ figure -- gleaming, gnarly, marked with flame-colored seams and dimples -- hangs across the room from David Hammons's 1988 "Air Jordan," a disconcertingly handsome piece of black inner tube studded with rusted bottle caps bent into the shape of cowrie shells. Between them, the two pieces are a master class in the cultural construction of majesty. The staid vertical stripes of Theaster Gates's "Civil Color Spectrum" (2023), a red and yellow palette of discarded fire hoses, are a perfect rejoinder to the procession of Klan hoods in a Philip Guston drawing; upstairs, a chrome-plated drain by Robert Gober winks at "Everything #5.1," Piper's window cut into the wall. WILL HEINRICH
France-Lise McGurn and Rita McGurn
Through Oct. 14. Margot Samel, 295 Church Street, Manhattan, 212-597-2747; margotsamel.com.
Do you see a family resemblance? Dozens of figures fill the gallery from floor to ceiling -- in paintings, murals drawn directly on the walls, and soft sculpture and fabric works that inhabit the floor -- but it's the mother-daughter pair responsible for crafting them that raises the question.
The work of the artists Rita McGurn (1940--2015) and France-Lise McGurn (born 1983), both center on figuration, but the contrast in their styles is stark enough that you can, as I did, divide the show accurately in two without looking at a checklist. Two of the nine paintings are by Rita, as are the 15 sculptural works -- busts, figures, or carpets -- mostly made of wool.
Rita never trained as an artist (attending art school only as a model), yet she created a substantial body of work rarely exhibited in her lifetime. France-Lise studied painting at the Royal College of Art in London and has exhibited at Tate Britain. It makes you wonder: Were France-Lise's studies more or less of an influence on her eventual art practice than sharing space with her mother's accruing artworks and witnessing their creation?
Here, the daughter's lyric, sketched paintings and murals, which render bodies, gestures and faces in few strokes, contain and surround the mother's delightfully outsider, crocheted beings. The bonds of family are often complex and unknowable. The gallery can barely contain the private catalyzing force of this, put on display without any sentimentality. JOHN VINCLER
Tetsuya Ishida
Through Oct. 21. Gagosian, 555 West 24th Street, Manhattan, 212-741-1111; gagosian.com.
During a decade-long career tinged by the economic malaise that shrouded Japan in the 1990s, Tetsuya Ishida practiced a kind of realist-Surrealism, depicting unnatural things happening within the recognizable confines of postindustrial life: salarymen swelling to the size of office blocks in which they're entombed; sullen shut-ins disappearing into the furniture. His pictures suggest an airless worldview where the only thing worse than not having a job is having one.
In Ishida's finely rendered nightmares of techno-automation and modern isolation, 76 of which are on view here, bodies transmogrify into despondent machinery or are dismembered and factory-packaged, barely veiled allusions to the dehumanizing effects of corporate capitalism.
Ishida's protagonists are recognizable in another way, too: all sharing the artist's round, guileless face, though not as autofiction. They are, as he said, "self-portraits of other people." Their repetition functions as a two-way mirror: a kindness that declined to trap others within his scenes of abjection, but also refused to absolve a viewer of a shared suffering.
There are traces of cyberpunk manga in Ishida's body horror, but his work largely diverged from dominant Japanese styles. Unlike the more palatable and chromatic Neo Pop of his contemporaries that shunned the unrelenting bleakness around them, Ishida, who died in 2005 at 31, channeled Surrealist forebears like Leonor Fini and Leonora Carrington, embracing a mesmeric gloominess and despairing palette. These are unlovely images, hard to look at. Ishida knew we look away at our peril. MAX LAKIN

Brawl Over a Chain, Then Reprisals, Led to a Rap Idol's Death: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Grand jury witness testimony describes how hyperlocal clashes between warring gang factions spilled into a fatal dispute that would alter the course of hip-hop history.
In the adrenalized aftermath of a Mike Tyson prizefight in 1996, a black BMW carrying the rapper Tupac Shakur pulled up to a red light just off the Las Vegas Strip, thrilling the women in the car next to him.
As Mr. Shakur hung out of his passenger-side window, his friends in the Lexus behind him assumed that he was inviting the women to his record label's new nightspot, Club 662 -- its numeric name a barely disguised telephone code for "MOB."
The women pulled away and a white Cadillac took their place. A large, muscular arm emerged from its rear window and fired a barrage of shots from a .40-caliber Glock pistol into the BMW. Mr. Shakur was hit four times.
The driver of the BMW, the Death Row Records impresario Marion Knight, better known as Suge, was grazed by the gunfire. But he managed to take off, making a U-turn over a traffic median and driving the wounded Mr. Shakur in the opposite direction before pulling over.
Malcolm Greenidge, a rapper and close friend of Mr. Shakur's who had been following them in the Lexus, rushed out of the car to check on Mr. Shakur, he testified this summer to a Las Vegas grand jury. Mr. Shakur seemed less concerned with his wounds than with Greenidge's safety as armed police officers approached the chaotic scene, he recalled.
"Get on the ground, they're going to shoot you," Mr. Shakur told him, Mr. Greenidge testified. Mr. Shakur would die less than a week later, at 25.
In the 27 years since, accounts of what happened on Sept. 7, 1996, have existed in an unwieldy tangle of news reports, true crime specials, street gossip, internet innuendo and dubious self-mythologizing. The case went cold.
But with last week's indictment of Duane Keith Davis, a former Compton gang leader known as Keffe D, who has been saying publicly for years that he was in the white Cadillac when the fatal shots were fired, prosecutors have begun to map out the most detailed narrative yet of the chain of events they say led to Mr. Shakur's death, one that will be tested in court.
While the broad outlines of Mr. Shakur's killing and its possible motive have long been known, hundreds of pages of grand jury witness testimony reviewed by The New York Times -- given under oath and with surprisingly vivid descriptions for a decades-old case -- offer new details of how hyperlocal disputes between warring gang factions had spilled into an ultimately fatal rap beef that would alter the course of hip-hop history.
The son of Black Panther parents and a onetime performing arts student turned hip-hop backup dancer, Mr. Shakur had broken out as a solo artist in the early 1990s with a unique blend of introspective street poetry and young man's fury. A proud antihero whose popularity only grew as he became mired in violence and rivalries, Mr. Shakur transformed in death into a hip-hop icon and pop culture martyr.
On Wednesday, Mr. Davis made his first appearance in Clark County District Court for a scheduled arraignment, which the judge postponed because Mr. Davis did not have a lawyer present, saying that his longtime California-based lawyer, Edi Faal, could not be there. In a brief phone interview, Mr. Faal said Mr. Davis, 60, intended to plead not guilty; he declined to discuss specifics about the case, saying he was in the process of getting Mr. Davis a Nevada lawyer.
"Like in all cases, I think we should allow things to play out in the courtroom," Mr. Faal said.
Some of the new evidence challenges the conventional wisdom that had formed around the killing. While Mr. Davis had previously told law enforcement officials that the gun had been fired by his nephew, Orlando Anderson, who was killed in a gang-related shooting in 1998, two witnesses shared accounts with the grand jury casting doubt on the widely believed narrative.
Those close to the case have reacted to news of Mr. Davis's arrest with a mixture of shock and relief.
Allen Hughes, who directed two of Mr. Shakur's early music videos and worked with his estate on "Dear Mama: The Saga of Afeni and Tupac Shakur," a documentary series about the rapper and his mother that was released this year, said the family had wondered if there would ever be accountability for his death.
"All these years, we all knew what it was," he said. "Just because law enforcement didn't close the case, doesn't mean we didn't feel we knew who the true culprits were."
Now someone has been indicted in his death. And Greg Kading, a retired Los Angeles police detective who began to reinvestigate the killing in 2006, said, "Tupac Shakur's murder will never again go down as an unsolved mystery."
Brawls and Retaliation
Mr. Shakur's music and public persona had taken on a darker edge following his 1993 arrest and subsequent conviction for sexual abuse, as he aligned himself with the gangster rap label Death Row Records and its leader, Suge Knight, who orchestrated his $ 1.4 million bond pending appeal.
While still awaiting the verdict in the case, Mr. Shakur had been ambushed, robbed and shot in the lobby of a Manhattan recording studio, an attack he later blamed on his former friend the Notorious B.I.G. and affiliates of the New York-based label Bad Boy Records, including Sean Combs, known then as Puff Daddy. (They denied involvement, with the Notorious B.I.G. claiming that his taunting track "Who Shot Ya?" had been written before the incident.)
After Mr. Shakur responded with the furious, personal diss "Hit 'Em Up" in June 1996, what was once a simmering competition between the hip-hop vanguard on the East and West Coasts became a boiling feud, with each side relying on support from sworn enemies in the gang underworld for protection and street credibility.
Those rising tensions began to boil over as players from each side prepared to travel to Las Vegas to watch Mr. Tyson fight Bruce Seldon at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.
Not long before the fight, a brawl at the Lakewood Mall in Southern California set off a sequence of retaliation.
Denvonta Lee, who said he was an affiliate of Compton's South Side Crips, told the Las Vegas grand jury this summer that Mr. Davis -- who called himself "the five-star general" of the local Crip set -- had given a local football player $ 4,000 to shop for clothes before heading to college and told other gang members to accompany him to the mall.
There, the group of young Crips collided with a Death Row-affiliated group of Mob Piru Bloods, their nearby rivals, resulting in a struggle over a Death Row chain. "That's like taking somebody's crown," Mr. Lee testified. "It means something." Within 24 hours, he added, "a war" had broken out locally. "There was shootings everywhere," he said.
One of the participants in the mall fight, witnesses said, was Orlando Anderson, a nephew of Mr. Davis's known as Baby Lane. That September, Mr. Anderson traveled to Las Vegas with his uncle and other Crips for a weekend of boxing, gambling and revelry.
The heavyweight fight ended in less than two minutes with a first-round Tyson knockout. Some ticket holders hadn't even made it to their seats before it was over.
As those gathered plotted their next moves for the evening, Mr. Anderson, brushing off the need for backup, found himself alone near the MGM hotel elevators and face to face with Mr. Shakur and his entourage of Bloods, including the same man whose Death Row chain had been targeted at the mall in California.
In a scuffle that was captured by security cameras at about 9 p.m. that night, the group began to punch and kick Mr. Anderson, who declined to cooperate with the police and hotel security after his assailants scattered.
Now, it was Mr. Anderson who was looking to exact revenge. "He wasn't coming back to Compton with nothing being done," Lee told the grand jury.
A Fatal Encounter
Mr. Davis, a successful drug dealer and "shot caller" for the Crips at the time of Mr. Shakur's death, wrote in a 2019 memoir, "Compton Street Legend," that on the night of the shooting he obtained a Glock pistol from a drug associate from Harlem before setting out with Mr. Anderson to find Mr. Shakur and Mr. Knight.
A childhood friend of Mr. Knight's -- the two played Pop Warner football together -- Mr. Davis had found himself enmeshed throughout the 1990s in the growing gangster rap nightlife scene, but his relationship with Death Row soured as the label became more closely associated with the Bloods. Mr. Davis instead aligned himself with their cross-country rivals at Bad Boy, supplying his Crip soldiers as West Coast security for the label's artists and executives, in exchange for access to concerts and parties.
Following a failed stakeout targeting Mr. Shakur and Mr. Knight at Club 662, the white Cadillac that Mr. Davis and Mr. Anderson were riding in came upon Mr. Shakur's BMW by chance, spotting him as he leaned out from the passenger side.
"If Pac had not been hanging out of the window, we would have never seen them," Mr. Davis wrote. "Like two rams locking horns, Suge and I looked each other dead in the eye."
According to witness testimony and law enforcement accounts, Terrence Brown was driving the white Cadillac that night; Mr. Davis rode in the front passenger seat, with Mr. Anderson behind him and Deandrae Smith, known as Big Dre, also sitting in the back. (Mr. Davis is the only person in the vehicle who is still alive, the police said.)
In describing the shooting, Mr. Davis wrote in his memoir that he had tossed the Glock into the back seat before the encounter at the traffic light. While he has sometimes refused to say who fired the shots that night, he told law enforcement officials in interviews about 15 years ago that it had been Mr. Anderson.
But new testimony in the case suggests a different version of events.
Mr. Lee, the grand jury witness, was Mr. Smith's roommate at the time, and told the court in July that Mr. Smith had admitted at the time that he fired the shots that killed Mr. Shakur and injured Mr. Knight. "Orlando didn't have a clear shot," he said, adding, "Dre said, 'Hey, give me the pistol,' got the pistol, boom, did his thing."
In the aftermath, however, speculation spread in Compton and beyond that Mr. Anderson had pulled the trigger as retribution for his beating at the MGM. Mr. Smith let Mr. Anderson have the "glory," Mr. Lee testified. "He didn't want to take the credit for Orlando."
The indictment of Mr. Davis does not identify the shooter, stating that Mr. Davis provided the gun to Mr. Smith "and/or" Mr. Anderson "with the intent that said co-conspirators commit said crime." Mr. Kading, the former Los Angeles detective, said in an interview that he believed that the "overriding evidence is Keffe D's own admissions within his law enforcement interviews that he handed the gun to Orlando Anderson and Orlando Anderson pulled the trigger."
Mr. Anderson, his friend said, often stopped short of claiming the murder. "'You all crazy, man, don't believe everything you hear,"' Mr. Lee recalled him saying.
Sharing His Story
Immediately after the killing, as a related gang war broke out in Compton, the police there arranged what Robert Ladd, a former Compton Police Department detective, described to the grand jury as a "massive multi-gang search warrant," arresting known gang members to try to reduce the violence in the streets and searching the homes of Mr. Davis and the others from the white Cadillac.
But the initial investigation stalled, with the police blaming a lack of cooperation from witnesses. It was revived in 2006 when the Los Angeles Police Department opened a task force into the still-unsolved 1997 killing of the Notorious B.I.G. in a shooting long thought to be related to Mr. Shakur's death.
It was during that inquiry that Mr. Kading, the Los Angeles police detective, persuaded Mr. Davis to speak with him after dangling the threat of a drug trafficking prosecution.
In 2008, Mr. Davis agreed to what is called a proffer agreement, in which Mr. Kading promised to not prosecute Mr. Davis using what he told him about Tupac and Biggie, so long as nothing he said proved to be a lie.
Mr. Kading taped Mr. Davis's interview, and after retiring from the Police Department, the detective used the contents of the confession in a 2011 book called "Murder Rap: The Untold Story of the Biggie Smalls and Tupac Shakur Murder Investigations." In 2015, the recording was included in a documentary based on the book.
Mr. Davis was irritated by Mr. Kading's disclosures. Eager to share his story after recovering from colon cancer, he began talking publicly about the case. It was a risky step. Although Mr. Davis -- who has spent a quarter of his life in prison, partly on drug trafficking charges -- would have been protected from prosecution for what he told Mr. Kading during their meeting, his later public disclosures were not protected, legal experts said.
Mr. Davis gave his first public interview on the subject of Mr. Shakur's death for a 2018 docu-series called "Death Row Chronicles."
"He was trying to word things careful enough to walk a tightrope between taking credit, but not getting arrested," said Mike Dorsey, the director of "Murder Rap," who consulted on "Death Row Chronicles." He said Mr. Davis arrived with a lawyer.
After the series aired without leading to charges, Mr. Davis wrote about the case in his memoir; his interviews on the subject, including with prominent YouTubers, grew "looser and looser," Mr. Dorsey said.
Police officials and prosecutors in Las Vegas were watching Mr. Davis's interviews closely.
"Since 2019, he has appeared at least eight separate times in promotion of this book and repeated various versions of these events, all of which he acknowledges that he is in fact the person that ordered the death of Mr. Shakur," Marc DiGiacomo, a prosecutor on the case, said in court on Friday.
In his memoir, Mr. Davis at times softened toward Mr. Shakur and his family, writing that he had a "deep sense of remorse" for the pain his death caused.
Still, he held firm that revenge was necessary for the beating of his nephew, going as far as to say that for some of the Crips involved, the killing earned them "some stripes."
"But it generated too much attention," Mr. Davis went on, "and put us under a microscope by law enforcement that would not cease and eventually brought us down. It was a big-time loss for everybody involved."

On Wednesday, Davis made his first appearance in Clark County District Court for a scheduled arraignment, which the judge postponed because Davis did not have a lawyer present, saying that his longtime California-based lawyer, Edi Faal, could not be there. In a brief phone interview, Faal said Davis, 60, intended to plead not guilty. He declined to discuss specifics about the case, saying he was in the process of getting Davis a Nevada lawyer.
“Like in all cases, I think we should allow things to play out in the courtroom,” Faal said.
Some of the new evidence challenges the conventional wisdom that had formed around the killing. While Davis had previously told law enforcement officials that the gun had been fired by his nephew, Orlando Anderson, who was killed in a gang-related shooting in 1998, two witnesses shared accounts with the grand jury casting doubt on the widely believed narrative.
Those close to the case have reacted to news of Davis’ arrest with a mixture of shock and relief.
Allen Hughes, who directed two of Shakur’s early music videos and worked with his estate on “Dear Mama: The Saga of Afeni and Tupac Shakur,” a documentary series about the rapper and his mother released this year, said the family had wondered if there would ever be accountability for his death.
“All these years, we all knew what it was,” he said. “Just because law enforcement didn’t close the case doesn’t mean we didn’t feel we knew who the true culprits were.”
Now someone has been indicted in his death. And Greg Kading, a retired Los Angeles police detective who began to reinvestigate the killing in 2006, said, “Tupac Shakur’s murder will never again go down as an unsolved mystery.”
Brawls and Retaliation
Shakur’s music and public persona had taken on a darker edge following his 1993 arrest and subsequent conviction for sexual abuse, as he aligned himself with gangster rap label Death Row Records and its leader, Suge Knight, who orchestrated his $1.4 million bond pending appeal.
While still awaiting the verdict in the case, Shakur had been ambushed, robbed and shot in the lobby of a New York City recording studio, an attack he later blamed on his former friend the Notorious B.I.G. and affiliates of the New York-based label Bad Boy Records, including Sean Combs, known then as Puff Daddy. (They denied involvement, with the Notorious B.I.G. claiming that his taunting track “Who Shot Ya?” had been written before the incident.)
After Shakur responded with the furious, personal dis “Hit ’Em Up” in June 1996, what was once a simmering competition between the hip-hop vanguard on the East and West Coasts became a boiling feud, with each side relying on support from sworn enemies in the gang underworld for protection and street credibility.
Those rising tensions began to boil over as players from each side prepared to travel to Las Vegas to watch Tyson fight Bruce Seldon at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.
Not long before the fight, a brawl at the Lakewood Mall in Southern California set off a sequence of retaliation.
Denvonta Lee, who said he was an affiliate of Compton’s South Side Crips, told the Las Vegas grand jury this summer that Davis — who called himself “the five-star general” of the local Crip set — had given a local football player $4,000 to shop for clothes before heading to college and told other gang members to accompany him to the mall.
There, the group of young Crips collided with a Death Row-affiliated group of Mob Piru Bloods, their nearby rivals, resulting in a struggle over a Death Row chain. “That’s like taking somebody’s crown,” Lee testified. “It means something.” Within 24 hours, he added, “a war” had broken out locally. “There was shootings everywhere,” he said.
One of the participants in the mall fight, witnesses said, was Orlando Anderson, a nephew of Davis’s known as Baby Lane. That September, Anderson traveled to Las Vegas with his uncle and other Crips for a weekend of boxing, gambling and revelry.
The heavyweight fight ended in less than two minutes with a first-round Tyson knockout. Some ticket holders hadn’t even made it to their seats before it was over.
As those gathered plotted their next moves for the evening, Anderson, brushing off the need for backup, found himself alone near the MGM hotel elevators and face to face with Shakur and his entourage of Bloods, including the same man whose Death Row chain had been targeted at the mall in California.
In a scuffle that was captured by security cameras at about 9 p.m. that night, the group began to punch and kick Anderson, who declined to cooperate with the police and hotel security after his assailants scattered.
Now, it was Anderson who was looking to exact revenge. “He wasn’t coming back to Compton with nothing being done,” Lee told the grand jury.
A Fatal Encounter
Davis, a successful drug dealer and “shot caller” for the Crips at the time of Shakur’s death, wrote in a 2019 memoir, “Compton Street Legend,” that on the night of the shooting he obtained a Glock pistol from a drug associate from New York before setting out with Anderson to find Shakur and Knight.
A childhood friend of Knight’s — the two played Pop Warner football together — Davis had found himself enmeshed throughout the 1990s in the growing gangster rap nightlife scene, but his relationship with Death Row soured as the label became more closely associated with the Bloods. Davis instead aligned himself with their cross-country rivals at Bad Boy, supplying his Crip soldiers as West Coast security for the label’s artists and executives, in exchange for access to concerts and parties.
Following a failed stakeout targeting Shakur and Knight at Club 662, the white Cadillac that Davis and Anderson were riding in came upon Shakur’s BMW by chance, spotting him as he leaned out from the passenger side.
“If Pac had not been hanging out of the window, we would have never seen them,” Davis wrote. “Like two rams locking horns, Suge and I looked each other dead in the eye.”
According to witness testimony and law enforcement accounts, Terrence Brown was driving the white Cadillac that night. Davis rode in the front passenger seat, with Anderson behind him and Deandrae Smith, known as Big Dre, also sitting in the back. (Davis is the only person in the vehicle who is still alive, police said.)
In describing the shooting, Davis wrote in his memoir that he had tossed the Glock into the back seat before the encounter at the traffic light. While he has sometimes refused to say who fired the shots that night, he told law enforcement officials in interviews about 15 years ago that it had been Anderson.
But new testimony in the case suggests a different version of events.
Lee, the grand jury witness, was Smith’s roommate at the time, and told the court in July that Smith had admitted at the time that he fired the shots that killed Shakur and injured Knight. “Orlando didn’t have a clear shot,” he said, adding, “Dre said, ‘Hey, give me the pistol,’ got the pistol, boom, did his thing.”
In the aftermath, however, speculation spread in Compton and beyond that Anderson had pulled the trigger as retribution for his beating at the MGM. Smith let Anderson have the “glory,” Lee testified. “He didn’t want to take the credit for Orlando.”
The indictment of Davis does not identify the shooter, stating that Davis provided the gun to Smith “and/or” Anderson “with the intent that said co-conspirators commit said crime.” Kading, the former Los Angeles detective, said in an interview that he believed that the “overriding evidence is Keffe D’s own admissions within his law enforcement interviews that he handed the gun to Orlando Anderson and Orlando Anderson pulled the trigger.”
Anderson, his friend said, often stopped short of claiming the murder. “‘You all crazy, man, don’t believe everything you hear,’” Lee recalled him saying.
Sharing His Story
Immediately after the killing, as a related gang war broke out in Compton, police there arranged what Robert Ladd, a former Compton Police Department detective, described to the grand jury as a “massive multi-gang search warrant,” arresting known gang members to try to reduce the violence in the streets and searching the homes of Davis and the others from the white Cadillac.
But the initial investigation stalled, with police blaming a lack of cooperation from witnesses. It was revived in 2006 when the Los Angeles Police Department opened a task force into the still-unsolved 1997 killing of the Notorious B.I.G. in a shooting long thought to be related to Shakur’s death.
It was during that inquiry that Kading persuaded Davis to speak with him after dangling the threat of a drug trafficking prosecution.
In 2008, Davis agreed to what is called a proffer agreement, in which Kading promised to not prosecute Davis using what he told him about Tupac and Biggie, so long as nothing he said proved to be a lie.
Kading taped Davis’ interview, and after retiring from the Police Department, the detective used the contents of the confession in a 2011 book called “Murder Rap: The Untold Story of the Biggie Smalls and Tupac Shakur Murder Investigations.” In 2015, the recording was included in a documentary based on the book.
Davis was irritated by Kading’s disclosures. Eager to share his story after recovering from colon cancer, he began talking publicly about the case. It was a risky step. Although Davis — who has spent a quarter of his life in prison, partly on drug trafficking charges — would have been protected from prosecution for what he told Kading during their meeting, his later public disclosures were not protected, legal experts said.
Davis gave his first public interview on the subject of Shakur’s death for a 2018 docuseries called “Death Row Chronicles.”
“He was trying to word things careful enough to walk a tightrope between taking credit, but not getting arrested,” said Mike Dorsey, the director of “Murder Rap,” who consulted on “Death Row Chronicles.” He said Davis arrived with a lawyer.
After the series aired without leading to charges, Davis wrote about the case in his memoir. His interviews on the subject, including with prominent YouTubers, grew “looser and looser,” Dorsey said.
Police officials and prosecutors in Las Vegas were watching Davis’ interviews closely.
“Since 2019, he has appeared at least eight separate times in promotion of this book and repeated various versions of these events, all of which he acknowledges that he is in fact the person that ordered the death of Mr. Shakur,” Marc DiGiacomo, a prosecutor on the case, said in court last Friday.
In his memoir, Davis at times softened toward Shakur and his family, writing that he had “deep sense of remorse” for the pain his death caused.
Still, he held firm that revenge was necessary for the beating of his nephew, going as far as to say that for some of the Crips involved, the killing earned them “some stripes.”
“But it generated too much attention,” Davis went on, “and put us under a microscope by law enforcement that would not cease and eventually brought us down. It was a big-time loss for everybody involved.”

Can an Industrial Heartland That's Slowing, Graying and in Debt Be Revived?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: China, facing an economic slump, wants to make its industrial northeast more productive, turning to policies that some economists say have outlived their time.
Hundreds of workers at a factory in Shenyang in northeastern China weld automated machines, 95 yards long, that are used to bore subway tunnels. At another factory there, employees assemble robots that China's solar panel makers will use to streamline their production.
Shenyang is the capital of Liaoning Province, one of three large provinces in the northeast that constitute the cradle of China's heavy industry. Now the central government, confronting a national economy that has slowed because of a real estate crisis that defies easy fixes, is turning to cities like Shenyang. It hopes to squeeze more productivity and efficiency out of the region's factories.
But those factories tell only part of the story of the economy of northeastern China, underlining the challenges facing Beijing policymakers, who are turning to what many economists believe is a tired playbook focused on industrial investments instead of more social benefits for consumers.
The region's birthrate is plummeting: A quarter of the population is 65 or older, and that share is growing about two percentage points a year, while the share of working-age adults is declining by about the same amount. Fewer people are buying new homes, apartment prices are falling and construction cranes are less active.
Northeastern China is like the Michigan and Ohio of Chinese manufacturing, but with a population considerably grayer than Florida's. In many ways, the region is a composite of the most deeply embedded problems facing the country's economy.
The area is heavily in debt. Public revenues are slumping because of the real estate bust. Pensions are the responsibility of the region's three provincial governments -- Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang -- and their cost is soaring.
On a recent evening, Zhang Shaocheng, 70, a retiree from a state-owned paint factory, waited with other seniors for a free outdoor movie at a shuttered Shenyang machinery factory. He appreciates that today's factories emit less pollution than the ones from his working years, but he and other seniors are counting on the government to take care of them.
"The air is good now, and I have a pension," Mr. Zhang said.
As the Chinese economy has slowed this year, the northeast is perilously close to tipping into a recession. Making sure that the economy of China's industrial heartland can keep growing and support a rising pension burden, as well as produce more exports, has become a top priority in Beijing.
In early September, when heads of state gathered for the Group of 20 summit in New Delhi, China's top leader, Xi Jinping, stayed home and traveled to northeastern China.
The region holds strategic importance. It encompasses sensitive regions abutting North Korea and Russia. It is home to much of China's armaments industry, first built with Soviet advisers in the 1950s. It is China's main producer of grain and crude oil. And it has been a bastion of China's Communist Party since the 1940s and a hub of often strident nationalism.
Mr. Xi called for quick action. What has emerged after the trip, and from media briefings in Liaoning arranged by the national government, is a plan largely focused on more public investment, a longtime theme of Beijing's policies. A notable aspect of the program involves digital technology, steps like upgrading car factories with robots.
What's missing from it are measures that could boost consumer confidence, such as expanded unemployment benefits and pensions, or direct payments to households to stimulate spending. Such steps have been absent from measures undertaken so far to try to help the national economy.
The biggest step taken so far to increase demand for goods from the northeast is also the measure most likely to upset the West: selling more to Russia. Chinese automakers have captured half the car market there, for example, after Western rivals pulled out last year following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
"The northeast is an important gateway for our country to open to the north," Mr. Xi declared during his visit to Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang.
In many ways, China's northeast is a natural target for economic stimulus based on public investment. In other parts of the country, many young job seekers shun factory jobs, seeking office work for even half the pay. But the northeast still has many multigenerational families of technicians.
"In the northeast, the manufacturing culture is strong," said Li Kai, an economist at Northeastern University in Shenyang.
The region's iron ore mines, steel mills and machinery factories are little affected by trade issues like the United States' restrictions on superfast semiconductors. A factory in Shenyang that makes car seats for Germany's BMW, for example, imports a less advanced semiconductor from Italy to manage the seat's complex movements.
"It is not a high-end chip, so there is no impact," said Kou Chuang, the business manager at the factory, which is owned by two Chinese auto parts manufacturers, Jinbei and Yanfeng.
Shenyang has also joined a recent national move by Chinese cities to ease mortgage rules. Home buyers now can qualify for the same discounted interest rate given to first-time buyers, even if they previously owned a home and already paid off its mortgage.
The northeast is home to many state-owned enterprises, some of which have sought greater efficiency by gradually shifting to partial private ownership.
Northern Heavy Industries in Shenyang, which has expanded rapidly since the 1950s, underwent a corporate overhaul in 2013. Today, Fangda Group, a privately held Liaoning conglomerate, holds a majority stake. Bingshan Group, a refrigeration equipment giant in Liaoning, is one-third owned by the municipal government of Dalian, where it has its headquarters, but has sold a small stake to Panasonic of Japan.
To stabilize consumer spending in the region, the government is investing in building culture-themed shopping plazas and museums that might prompt residents and tourists to spend money.
Officials in Liaoning have stepped up spending on cultural institutions like the Liaoning Ballet Troupe, which had 30 performances in 2022 and already more than 40 this year.
The company recently performed an original composition, "Iron Man," about industrial workers in the 1950s, hoping to attract the province's many seniors while trying to draw a younger audience as well.
"We want the young people to know what their fathers have done," said Qu Zijiao, the ballet's director.
Summer tourism has picked up after the lifting of Covid controls in December. Cool weather made the northeast a popular destination as other parts of China baked in scorching temperatures.
Sue Sui, 50, an accountant from Beijing, sat on the beach in Dalian on a mid-September afternoon. She said she had not been able to visit in midsummer because every affordable hotel had been fully booked.
"There is revenge tourism spending," she said.
Yet weaknesses in consumer spending persist. Retail sales per person in Liaoning Province are just a third of the level in Beijing or Shanghai and half what they are in vibrant provinces in southeastern China.
There was almost nowhere to spend money at the well-preserved brick factory buildings where Mr. Zhang, the retiree, and others attended the outdoor movie. A small coffee shop was hidden behind a windowless door in a distant, unlit corner with no signage.
It was almost empty on the night of the movie.

Man Who Admitted Role in Death of Rapper Is Indicted: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The man, a former gang leader named Duane Keith Davis, has said the four shots that killed the rapper in 1996 came from the vehicle he was riding in.
More than 25 years after the killing of Tupac Shakur became a defining tragedy in hip-hop, a self-described gang member who has repeatedly proclaimed that he participated in the drive-by shooting was indicted on a murder charge, Las Vegas prosecutors said on Friday, reviving a blockbuster investigation that had long stalled.
The man, Duane Keith Davis, has said in interviews and a memoir that he was in the front passenger seat of the white Cadillac that pulled up near the vehicle holding Mr. Shakur after a 1996 prizefight between Mike Tyson and Bruce Seldon in Las Vegas.
The 25-year-old rapper was shot four times and died in a hospital less than a week later.
A grand jury in Clark County indicted Mr. Davis on one count of murder with use of a deadly weapon, plus a gang enhancement, a prosecutor said in court on Friday. Mr. Davis, whose arrest was earlier reported by The Associated Press, is in custody without bail.
Despite plentiful speculation, evidence and reporting across nearly three decades, no charges had ever been filed in the shooting of Mr. Shakur, who was one of the most popular artists of the 1990s, with tracks that brought poetic gravitas to confrontational gangster rap. But talk of the case was revived in July, when the Las Vegas police executed a search warrant at a home in Henderson, Nev., connected to Mr. Davis.
Marc DiGiacomo, a chief deputy district attorney in Clark County, said in court on Friday that Mr. Davis was the "on-ground, on-site commander" who "ordered the death" of Mr. Shakur and the attempted murder of Marion Knight, the rap mogul known as Suge, who was driving the car holding the rapper.
It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Davis had a lawyer.
In his 2019 memoir, Mr. Davis, who goes by the name Keffe D, recounted a gang dispute that escalated after Mr. Shakur and his associates beat up Mr. Davis's nephew, Orlando Anderson, following the boxing match at the MGM Grand hotel.
"Them jumping on my nephew gave us the ultimate green light to do something," Mr. Davis said in the memoir, "Compton Street Legend." "Tupac chose the wrong game to play."
According to a copy of the indictment filed in Clark County District Court, prosecutors accused Mr. Davis of obtaining a gun "for the purpose of seeking retribution against" Mr. Shakur and Mr. Knight, and of handing off the weapon either to his nephew or someone else in the Cadillac with "the intent that this crime be committed." Mr. Davis is the only person in the car who is still alive.
Mr. DiGiacomo acknowledged in court that the broad outlines of what had occurred that night were known to the police as far back as 1996.
"What was lacking was admissible evidence to establish this chain of events," the prosecutor said, noting that Mr. Davis then began to describe his role publicly. "He admitted within that book that he did acquire the firearm with the intent to go hunt down Mr. Shakur and Mr. Knight."
At a news conference on Friday, the Las Vegas police confirmed that Mr. Davis's own words reinvigorated their case, starting with a television appearance he made in 2018. "We knew at this time that this was likely our last time to take a run at this case," Lt. Jason Johansson of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said.
Mr. Davis had avoided directly naming the person who opened fire in recent interviews. But in a taped confession released by a former Los Angeles Police Department detective who investigated Mr. Shakur's murder, Mr. Davis told the police that it had been Mr. Anderson, his nephew, who was known as Baby Lane.
Mr. Anderson was questioned by officers investigating Mr. Shakur's death but was killed in a shooting in 1998.
In his memoir, Mr. Davis, who has also been known as Keefe D, said that after the shooting, the men abandoned the car and walked back to the hotel, picking the vehicle up the next day and taking it back to California. It was cleaned and painted before it was returned to the rental agency days later, Mr. Davis said. By that point it was "too late for any forensics to be accurate and reliable," he noted.
Immediately after Mr. Shakur's death, there was a flurry of activity in the investigation. More than 20 people were arrested in connection with shootings that the police said were suspected to be related gang attacks.
But as the years went on without any charges, Shakur's killing -- and the death of the Notorious B.I.G., his friend turned rival, six months later -- fueled conspiracy theories and accusations that the police had not worked hard enough to bring his killers to justice. The Las Vegas police have cited a lack of cooperation from people close to Mr. Shakur as a reason for the stalled investigation.
The killings became the subjects of books, podcasts, TV series and films, further elevating Mr. Shakur -- known for albums such as "Me Against the World," on which he rapped about a life imperiled by violence, and "All Eyez on Me," one of the genre's first double albums -- to a mythic role in hip-hop.
The investigation into the death of the Notorious B.I.G. was revived by the Los Angeles Police Department in the mid-2000s, ultimately leading to a re-examination of the Shakur killing. Greg Kading, one of the detectives involved in the inquiry, later wrote a book that detailed how investigators convinced Mr. Davis to cooperate with them through a proffer agreement, meaning he could not be charged with a crime based on any incriminating statements he might make in those interviews.
"I sang because they promised I would not be prosecuted," Mr. Davis wrote in his memoir.
On the night of the shooting, Mr. Shakur had been traveling in a BMW driven by Mr. Knight toward a postfight after-party at Club 662, a new venue backed by their record label, Death Row Records.
Mr. Davis, a self-described member of the Crips, wrote in his memoir that he, Mr. Anderson and others had armed themselves and waited in the nightclub parking lot, hoping to confront Mr. Shakur and Mr. Knight, who were associated with the Bloods, about the earlier violence.
When the rapper failed to materialize, Mr. Davis said, the group waiting for him left for its hotel, only to encounter Mr. Shakur and Mr. Knight talking to fans at a red light. "As they sat in traffic, we slowly rolled past the long line of luxury cars they had in their caravan, looking into each one until we pulled up to the front vehicle and found who we were seeking," Mr. Davis wrote.
Mr. Davis said Mr. Shakur's crew had committed "the ultimate disrespect when they kicked and beat down my nephew" -- an attack thought to be retribution for an earlier robbery of one of Mr. Shakur's friends. In his memoir, Davis described the "strict code" of the streets that its participants "live, kill and die by."
"Tupac's and Biggie's deaths were direct results of that code violation and the explosive consequences when the powerful worlds of the streets, entertainment and crooked-ass law enforcement collide," he wrote.
Mr. Davis added that he had been considered a "prime suspect" in both killings, and called writing about the events for his book "therapeutic."
Sitting for an interview with a rap chronicler known as DJ Vlad this year, Mr. Davis was asked whether he was concerned that his disclosures could lead to a prosecution. Mr. Davis, who was incarcerated for roughly 15 years, in part because of federal drug charges, said he was not scared of prison.
"They want to put me in jail for life?" he said. "That's just something I got to do."

More than 25 years after the killing of Tupac Shakur became a defining tragedy in hip-hop, a self-described gang member who has repeatedly proclaimed that he participated in the drive-by shooting was indicted on a murder charge, Las Vegas prosecutors said on Friday, reviving a blockbuster investigation that had long stalled.
The man, Duane Keith Davis, has said in interviews and a memoir that he was in the front passenger seat of the white Cadillac that pulled up near the vehicle holding Shakur after a 1996 prizefight between Mike Tyson and Bruce Seldon in Las Vegas.
The 25-year-old rapper was shot four times and died in a hospital less than a week later.
A grand jury in Clark County indicted Davis on one count of murder with use of a deadly weapon, plus a gang enhancement, a prosecutor said in court on Friday. Davis, whose arrest was earlier reported by The Associated Press, is in custody without bail.
Despite plentiful speculation, evidence and reporting across nearly three decades, no charges had ever been filed in the shooting of Shakur, who was one of the most popular artists of the 1990s, with tracks that brought poetic gravitas to confrontational gangster rap. But talk of the case was revived in July, when the Las Vegas police executed a search warrant at a home in Henderson, Nevada, connected to Davis.
Marc DiGiacomo, a chief deputy district attorney in Clark County, said in court on Friday that Davis was the “on-ground, on-site commander” who “ordered the death” of Shakur and the attempted murder of Marion Knight, the rap mogul known as Suge, who was driving the car holding the rapper.
It was not immediately clear whether Davis had a lawyer.
In his 2019 memoir, Davis, who goes by the name Keffe D, recounted a gang dispute that escalated after Shakur and his associates beat up Davis’ nephew, Orlando Anderson, after the boxing match at the MGM Grand hotel.
“Them jumping on my nephew gave us the ultimate green light to do something,” Davis said in the memoir, “Compton Street Legend.” “Tupac chose the wrong game to play.”
According to a copy of the indictment filed in Clark County District Court, prosecutors accused Davis of obtaining a gun “for the purpose of seeking retribution against” Shakur and Knight, and of handing off the weapon either to his nephew or someone else in the Cadillac with “the intent that this crime be committed.” Davis is the only person in the car who is still alive.
DiGiacomo acknowledged in court that the broad outlines of what had occurred that night were known to the police as far back as 1996.
“What was lacking was admissible evidence to establish this chain of events,” the prosecutor said, noting that Davis then began to describe his role publicly “He admitted within that book that he did acquire the firearm with the intent to go hunt down Mr. Shakur and Mr. Knight.”
At a news conference on Friday, the Las Vegas police confirmed that Davis’ own words reinvigorated their case, starting with a television appearance he made in 2018. “We knew at this time that this was likely our last time to take a run at this case,” Lt. Jason Johansson of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said.
Davis had avoided directly naming the person who opened fire in recent interviews. But in a taped confession released by a former Los Angeles Police Department detective who investigated Shakur’s murder, Davis told police that it had been Anderson, his nephew, who was known as Baby Lane.
Anderson was questioned by officers investigating Shakur’s death but was killed in a shooting in 1998.
In his memoir, Davis, who has also been known as Keefe D, said that after the shooting, the men abandoned the car and walked back to the hotel, picking the vehicle up the next day and taking it back to California. It was cleaned and painted before it was returned to the rental agency days later, Davis said. By that point it was “too late for any forensics to be accurate and reliable,” he noted.
Immediately after Shakur’s death, there was a flurry of activity in the investigation. More than 20 people were arrested in connection with shootings that the police said were suspected to be related gang attacks.
But as the years went on without any charges, Shakur’s killing — and the death of the Notorious B.I.G., his friend turned rival, six months later — fueled conspiracy theories and accusations that the police had not worked hard enough to bring his killers to justice. The Las Vegas police have cited a lack of cooperation from people close to Shakur as a reason for the stalled investigation.
The killings became the subjects of books, podcasts, TV series and films, further elevating Shakur — known for albums such as “Me Against the World,” on which he rapped about a life imperiled by violence, and “All Eyez on Me,” one of the genre’s first double albums — to a mythic role in hip-hop.
The investigation into the death of the Notorious B.I.G. was revived by the Los Angeles Police Department in the mid-2000s, ultimately leading to a re-examination of the Shakur killing. Greg Kading, one of the detectives involved in the inquiry, later wrote a book that detailed how investigators convinced Davis to cooperate with them through a proffer agreement, meaning he could not be charged with a crime based on any incriminating statements he might make in those interviews.
“I sang because they promised I would not be prosecuted,” Davis wrote in his memoir.
On the night of the shooting, Shakur had been traveling in a BMW driven by Knight toward a postfight after-party at Club 662, a new venue backed by their record label, Death Row Records.
Davis, a self-described member of the Crips, wrote in his memoir that he, Anderson and others had armed themselves and waited in the nightclub parking lot, hoping to confront Shakur and Knight, who were associated with the Bloods, about the earlier violence.
When the rapper failed to materialize, Davis said, the group waiting for him left for its hotel, only to encounter Shakur and Knight talking to fans at a red light. “As they sat in traffic, we slowly rolled past the long line of luxury cars they had in their caravan, looking into each one until we pulled up to the front vehicle and found who we were seeking,” Davis wrote.
Davis said Shakur’s crew had committed “the ultimate disrespect when they kicked and beat down my nephew” — an attack thought to be retribution for an earlier robbery of one of Shakur’s friends. In his memoir, Davis described the “strict code” of the streets that its participants “live, kill and die by.”
“Tupac’s and Biggie’s deaths were direct results of that code violation and the explosive consequences when the powerful worlds of the streets, entertainment and crooked-ass law enforcement collide,” he wrote.
Davis added that he had been considered a “prime suspect” in both killings, and called writing about the events for his book “therapeutic.”
Sitting for an interview with a rap chronicler known as DJ Vlad this year, Davis was asked whether he was concerned that his disclosures could lead to a prosecution. Davis, who was incarcerated for roughly 15 years, in part because of federal drug charges, said he was not scared of prison.
“They want to put me in jail for life?” he said. “That’s just something I got to do.”

Swedish Battery Maker To Build Quebec Factory With Help From Subsidies: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The Canadian government matched financial incentives available in the U.S. to attract the investment from Northvolt, a Swedish company.
Northvolt, a Swedish maker of batteries for electric cars, said on Thursday that it would build a factory near Montreal after the Canadian government matched financial incentives that would have been available from the United States.
The company will invest $ 5 billion in the factory, which will employ as many as 3,000 people and be among the largest battery plants in North America when it begins production in 2026.
The Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden's signature climate law, includes billions of dollars in incentives to create a domestic battery industry. It has sparked a boom in investment as well as fierce competition among government officials seeking to lure companies to their states or provinces.
U.S. allies have complained that incentives designed to create a domestic supply chain have ignited a costly subsidy arms race.
Canada's federal government and Quebec's provincial government will each provide $ 1 billion in subsidies for the project, effectively matching the incentives that Northvolt would have received had it decided to build a plant in the United States, said Paolo Cerruti, a founder of the company.
"Canada is mirroring those measures pretty much one to one," Mr. Cerruti, a former Tesla executive who will oversee the factory, said in an interview.
Northvolt was also drawn to the site, in McMasterville and Saint-Basile-le-Grand, Quebec, because of the region's ample hydropower as well as mines that could eventually supply lithium and other raw materials, Mr. Cerruti said. A lithium mine near La Corne, Quebec, about 350 miles northwest of Montreal, began operations this year.
"We would like to have as much lithium as possible from Canada," Mr. Cerruti said.
Northvolt markets itself as a sustainable battery producer that aims to minimize greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental damage caused by its factories. The site in Quebec will also include a recycling center that Northvolt says will eventually yield half of the lithium, cobalt, nickel and other raw materials required for electric car batteries.
Mr. Cerruti said Northvolt had lined up customers for the Quebec plant, but he declined to name them. In Europe, Northvolt makes batteries for carmakers including BMW, Volkswagen and Volvo. The company's main factory is in northern Sweden, and it is building a factory near Hamburg that will receive subsidies from the German government.
In April, Volkswagen said it would invest about $ 5 billion to build a battery factory in St. Thomas, Ontario, which will also benefit from government financing.

Sunak Softens Britain's Climate Change Targets as Election Approaches: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he would delay a ban on the sale of new gas- and diesel-only cars, among other measures, sparking division in his own party.
After years of claiming leadership in the international fight against climate change, Britain's government on Wednesday gambled on an abrupt change of course, weakening key environmental pledges and promising lower costs for Britons who will soon be asked to vote in a general election.
Brushing aside sharp criticism from business leaders, environmentalists and some of his own Conservative lawmakers, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he would stick to Britain's overall goals for achieving net zero by 2050 but would do so in what he described as a more "sensible" way.
"It cannot be right for Westminster to impose such significant costs on working people," said Mr. Sunak, referring to the seat of Britain's government. He added, "If we continue down this path we risk losing the consent of the British people."
Mr. Sunak said that he would delay by five years a ban on the sale of gas and diesel cars, lower targets for replacing gas boilers and would propose new no new measures to discourage passengers from taking airplanes or to encourage car pooling.
Analysts said the significant shift in policy was designed to set a dividing line between the government and the opposition Labour Party ahead of a general election that Mr. Sunak must call by January 2025. Labour, led by Keir Starmer, has maintained a double-digit lead in the polls for months, and Mr. Sunak's own ratings have fallen since he became prime minister last October.
The new thinking in Downing Street seems to have crystallized after the Conservatives won a surprise victory in July in a parliamentary election in northwest London when they campaigned against moves by the city's Labour mayor to expand an air-quality initiative that charges drivers of older, more polluting vehicles.
Tom Burke, the chairman of E3G, an environmental research group, said that Mr. Sunak was seeking to send a political signal that his party supports car owners and those in economically stressed parts of the country, many of whom switched from Labour to the Conservatives in the 2019 general election.
"The point of this is to put Starmer in a trap of having to choose between the left-behind voters who he needs to win back, and the young green urbanites who are his natural supporters," said Mr. Burke, who has advised three former Conservative environment secretaries.
He added, however, that Mr. Sunak's shift was a "strategic error" that had revealed "the split inside the Tory Party" over climate action.
The new policy risks alienating large sections of the electorate at a time of growing public awareness of global warming, after Europe experienced record heat and devastating wildfires and floods this summer. Polling shows there is a broad consensus within Britain on the need for climate action.
The timing was jarring internationally, coming as the United Nations General Assembly -- from which Mr. Sunak was notably absent -- discussed climate protection policy. Earlier this year, the body's secretary general, António Guterres, warned that the era of global warming had ended and "the era of global boiling has arrived."
The announcement also coincided with King Charles III's state visit to France, which is intended to underscore the areas in which the two countries are working together, including on climate policy, a particular interest of the British monarch.
Mr. Sunak defended his position by arguing that Britain was doing more than other nations. "When our share of global emissions is less than 1 percent how can it be right that British citizens are now being told to sacrifice even more than others?"
Several lawmakers on the right of his party, and Britain's influential right-wing newspapers, praised the new approach and noted that the new, delayed, target of 2035 for the ban on sale of new gas and diesel cars is the same as that of the European Union.
But prominent critics included former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who said that "business must have certainty about our net zero commitments" and that "we cannot afford to falter now or in any way lose our ambition for this country."
Chris Skidmore, a Conservative lawmaker, told the BBC that the changes were "potentially the greatest mistake" of Mr. Sunak's tenure so far, adding that "delivering on net zero provides a benefit not a cost."
Perhaps worse for Mr. Sunak was an angry response from Ford U.K., whose chair, Lisa Brankin, issued a statement regarding the delayed ban on new gas- and diesel-only cars that said: "Our business needs three things from the U.K. government: ambition, commitment and consistency. A relaxation of 2030 would undermine all three."
Automakers have made significant investments in Britain to meet the 2030 deadline. In July, Tata, the Indian conglomerate that owns Jaguar Land Rover, said it would build a battery plant in western England, a four-billion-pound (roughly $ 5 billion) project subsidized with government funds. And earlier this month BMW announced a $ 750 million investment to build electric Minis in Britain. Its plans called for converting an Oxford assembly plant to produce electric vehicles exclusively by 2030.
Those investments were a result of government policies promoting the transition to electric vehicles, said Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, an industry group, in a statement on Wednesday. He said government must provide a "clear, consistent message" to help car buyers make the switch to electric.
"Confusion and uncertainty will only hold them back," he said.
James Alexander, chief executive of the U.K. Sustainable Investment and Finance Association, warned that Britain risked falling further behind in a global race to secure investment for the green transition to net zero if the government hurts investors' confidence.
Just a couple of years ago, Britain was "very clearly a global leader on sustainability and driving the global agenda" but "the government has backed firmly away from this direction of travel," Mr. Alexander said. "And investors follow policymakers' signals." Mr. Burke noted that most of the policy changes -- including the deadline change for the ban on gas and diesel cars -- would do nothing to reduce daily costs for voters in the short term, could cost Mr. Sunak support among more centrist swing voters in the south and would cause division within his own party. "Parties that are split rarely get elected and this is a party that's completely split," he said.
But the policy shift seemed to give a foretaste of the combative general election campaign that the Conservative Party seems to be planning next year.
Talking to the BBC on Wednesday the home secretary, Suella Braverman, put the party's new position bluntly: "We are not going to save the planet by bankrupting the British people."

Britain and Tata to Spend $1.6 Billion on Steel Plant: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The plan aims to cut both emissions and financial losses at Britain's largest steel mill, but a union says it will also put many jobs at risk.
The British government and Tata Steel on Friday announced a 1.25-billion-pound package, or about $ 1.6 billion, to cut emissions and financial losses at Tata's steel mill -- the country's largest -- at Port Talbot in Wales, potentially putting many of the plant's 4,000 jobs at risk.
The government said the package would help clean up a site that it said was Britain's largest emitter, reducing the country's overall carbon emissions by 1.5 percent, and would ultimately preserve thousands of jobs. It will provide £500 million, with Tata contributing £750 million.
Kemi Badenoch, the business and trade secretary, said the deal was "expected to save thousands of jobs in the long term." But the government's statement refers to safeguarding only 5,000 jobs in Britain; Tata Steel employs more than 8,000 people, about half of them at Port Talbot.
A union that represents the bulk of steel production workers in Britain said the arrangement risked falling short of the stated goals. While Tata says the plan would "preserve significant employment," it is not guaranteeing jobs and has been losing money on its British operations for years.
"This deal will have devastating consequences for jobs and workers," the Community Union said in a statement on Friday. "It will rip the heart out of the Port Talbot community."
Tata said it would soon begin talks with the unions, including on a "potential deep restructuring" at Port Talbot.
Tata and the government proposed to replace the giant blast furnaces at Port Talbot, which use coal to extract iron from ore, with an electric furnace that melts scrap metal to make steel, a less polluting process. The government said the plant was nearing the end of its life.
But the new plant, which may require years to build, may not produce as much steel as the old facilities or employ as many people.
Steel-making units like blast furnaces and coke ovens would close, the union said, and an electric furnace is not likely to produce the same quality steel as a blast furnace, leading to job cuts at related plants.
"We believe that with electric arc furnaces, there is no way they can keep the portfolio they have got," said Alun Davies, a union official. "It is concerning."
Operations would be subject to the availability and price of electricity, which tends to be expensive in Britain, and to the fluctuations of the scrap metal market. The union said the steel produced by an electric furnace would not be suitable for some auto components and food and beverage containers, potentially leading to the closure of the plants that produce steel for those products and putting hundreds of jobs at risk.
Tata has been running large losses at its British operations and looking at solutions including mergers and, potentially, plant closings for years. In a recent filing, the company said the British steel unit lost £279 million in the latest financial year.
"It has been an absolute pleasure to work with" the British government, said Natarajan Chandrasekaran, the chairman of Tata Group, the parent company, in a statement.
The announcement is the latest example of the British government's being lobbied to put up substantial sums to preserve local jobs. On Monday, the government said it would provide support to help BMW produce electric versions of the popular Mini cars in Britain.
The government also agreed this year to provide an undisclosed amount of aid to encourage the Tata Group to invest £4 billion in a factory that would produce batteries likely to be used in electric vehicles made in Britain by Jaguar Land Rover, which the Indian conglomerate owns.

UAW Strike Looms Over Detroit Auto Show

DETROIT — The Detroit auto show kicked off this week with a burst of hoopla and glam, including a Darius Rucker concert sponsored by Ford Motor and an indoor test track built by Jeep that features a hill with a 40-degree slope.
But beyond the excitement and bright lights, Detroit’s annual auto show has been clouded by foreboding and dread. The three established U.S. automakers, the anchors of the show, are locked in difficult contract negotiations with the labor union that represents nearly 150,000 of their employees.
Even as automakers sought to drum up excitement about new versions of popular vehicles such as the Ford F-150 pickup truck and the GMC Acadia SUV to journalists, analysts and dealers, labor negotiators were racing to avoid a strike by the United Auto Workers that could make it impossible for those new models to find their way to showrooms. Despite those efforts, the union called a strike at three factories starting Friday.
The three automakers based in the Detroit area — General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Chrysler and Ram — are entangled in their greatest labor crisis in more than a decade even as they seek to display their best and brightest new models.
“You can feel it,” said Matt DeLorenzo, an independent auto analyst and author. “The executives I’ve talked to, you can see they’re concerned. I don’t see a lot of optimism that it’s going to be resolved fairly quickly.”
The UAW and its new president, Shawn Fain, are seeking a 40% increase in wages over the next four years. The union has also demanded pension improvements, a shorter workweek, company-paid health care for retirees and an end to a wage system in which new hires start at about half the top union wage of $32 an hour.
The automakers, which have been making near-record profits for the past several years, have countered with wage increases about half of what the union is seeking, while rejecting most of the UAW’s other demands.
There were few direct references to the UAW talks at the show, which will open its doors to the general public Saturday. But a prolonged strike would almost certainly jeopardize the automakers’ plans to roll out new cars and trucks to take advantage of still strong demand.
The auto industry has spent much of the past three years struggling to produce enough vehicles because of pandemic shutdowns and supply chain chaos. The inventory of new cars remains very low by historical standards, and prices are quite high, helping to raise profits.
If striking workers slow or stop production lines for many weeks or several months, customers looking for new cars will increasingly turn to foreign automakers or Tesla, the Texas-based producer of electric vehicles that is growing fast.

Full text: The three established U.S. automakers could struggle to get new cars and trucks to dealerships and customers if the walkouts drag on.
The Detroit auto show kicked off this week with a burst of hoopla and glam, including a Darius Rucker concert sponsored by Ford Motor and an indoor test track built by Jeep that features a hill with a 40-degree slope.
But beyond the excitement and bright lights, Detroit's annual auto show has been clouded by foreboding and dread. The three established U.S. automakers, the anchors of the show, are locked in difficult contract negotiations with the labor union that represents nearly 150,000 of their employees.
Even as automakers sought to drum up excitement about new versions of popular vehicles like the Ford F-150 pickup truck and the GMC Acadia sport utility vehicle to journalists, analysts and dealers, labor negotiators were racing to avoid a strike by the United Auto Workers that could make it impossible for those new models to find their way to showrooms. Despite those efforts, the union called a strike at three factories starting Friday.
The three automakers based in the Detroit area -- General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Chrysler and Ram -- are entangled in their greatest labor crisis in more than a decade even as they seek to display their best and brightest new models.
"You can feel it," said Matt DeLorenzo, an independent auto analyst and author. "The executives I've talked to, you can see they're concerned. I don't see a lot of optimism that it's going to be resolved fairly quickly."
The U.A.W. and its new president, Shawn Fain, are seeking a 40 percent increase in wages over the next four years. The union has also demanded pension improvements, a shorter workweek, company-paid health care for retirees and an end to a wage system in which new hires start at about half the top union wage of $ 32 an hour.
The automakers, which have been making near-record profits for the last several years, have countered with wage increases about half of what the union is seeking, while rejecting most of the U.A.W.'s other demands.
There were few direct references to the U.A.W. talks at the show, which will open its doors to the general public on Saturday. But a prolonged strike would almost certainly jeopardize the automakers' plans to roll out new cars and trucks to take advantage of still strong demand.
The auto industry has spent much of the last three years struggling to produce enough vehicles because of pandemic shutdowns and supply chain chaos. The inventory of new cars remains very low by historical standards, and prices are quite high, helping to raise profits.
If striking workers slow or stop production lines for many weeks or several months, customers looking for new cars will increasingly turn to foreign automakers or Tesla, the Texas-based producer of electric vehicles that is growing fast. Those other automakers operate U.S. plants that use nonunion workers and their production is unlikely to be affected directly by the strike.

When Professional Golfers Also Help Design, Rebuild or Renovate Courses: [Sports Desk]

Author: Sullivan, Paul J

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ernie Els, a four-time major champion, won the 2007 HSBC World Match Play Championship at the Wentworth Club in Surrey, England, host of this week's BMW PGA Championship.
The club, a sprawling complex of three 18-hole golf courses and a plenitude of amenities, was working to refresh the West Course, which hosted championship golf. Els was the architect in charge of the work.
Wentworth is the home of the European Tour, which runs the DP World Tour, and has hosted this week's flagship event since the 1980s. (Three times, Els finished as runner-up in the event.)
The West Course was originally designed by Harry Colt nearly 100 years earlier. Colt was one of the early 20th century's great golf course architects. He worked on some 300 courses, including the original routing of Pine Valley, often the top-ranked course in the world.
But the game had changed, and Els, who was known for his smooth swing, was brought in to restore some of the original challenges that Colt had created -- but that longer-hitting pros had rendered obsolete. One of the key fixes was rebuilding all the greens so they would have the firm bounce and fast speed that pros are used to.
Ten years after that victory at Wentworth, Els finished the renovation. "There's certainly no other golf course in the world that I know as well as Wentworth's West Course, so you could say we were the logical choice," Els said. "Obviously to have that opportunity was an honor, not just professionally but personally, too. I'd say I fell in love with the West Course before I'd even played it, seeing the World Matchplay on television, watching some of my heroes."
What Els had been asked to do, though, was something that has faded from popularity: be a tour pro who renovated a course.
Pros once lent their vast playing knowledge to golf course design projects -- often with an enormous real estate development attached -- but when the economy cooled in 2008 and new golf course construction dried up, so, too, did pros' involvement.
Golf course design is now in an era of star architects, such as Tom Doak and Gil Hanse, whose vision for the game focuses more on purity and enjoyment than on creating overly penal courses that will frustrate amateurs and most likely never host a professional tournament. The original golf course boom in the late-19th and early-20th centuries, however, was fueled by great golfers like Willie Park Jr., who won the British Open twice, and Donald Ross, a pro from Scotland.
Despite the recent trend, pros still maintain a role in course design, even if it is a very different one from decades past. It's more in the collaborative mode of Els at Wentworth than the splashy one that saw golf stars of the 1970s and 1980s like Lee Trevino, Chi Chi Rodriguez, Don January and Billy Casper lend their names to developments.
"If someone's been a good golfer, people believe they probably know everything about golf," said Geoff Ogilvy, the 2006 U.S. Open champion and a director at the design firm OCM Golf. "Some do; some don't. But when I'm meeting members, I think it helps when I can wax on the virtues of the 13th hole at Augusta National because I've played there. It makes it easier."
His firm has worked on major restorations of courses in Australia and is currently working on Medinah Country Club's Course 3, which will host the 2026 Presidents Cup, a series of matches between the United States and an international squad. (Ogilvy played three times on Presidents Cup teams.)
But he has two partners in the design firm who know the intricacies of building a course. "It's better to have three minds in there," said Ogilvy, who won 12 times on the PGA and European Tours. "They're routing and designing it. I'm working on a lot of the playability stuff. What would tour guys hit from here? Will guys go for that shot or get scared?"
That intuition, particularly on the psychological part of the game, is valuable to designers, said Bobby Weed, an architect who worked with 17 PGA Tour player consultants when he build out the Tournament Players Club Network, a group of courses designed to host professional tournaments.
"What I liked was their input into what scared them on a shot," said Weed, who was mentored by the designer Pete Dye. "I liked to understand how they're thinking, what their process was. It's so different from the amateur golfer."
He said not every pro was as involved or knowledgeable and that some got more credit after the course opened than they deserved. But many of the pros who have helped design enduring courses relied on a solid team under their brand name. Jack Nicklaus had Bob Cupp and Jay Morrish. Greg Norman had Jason McCoy. Ben Crenshaw had Bill Coore.
"The first thing the pros bring is their name. They're much more famous than any of us who never played professional golf ever will be," said Doak, an architect who worked with Nicklaus to build Sebonack Golf Club in Southampton, N.Y.
"What they bring is much more focus on the individual golf holes and the strategy of the individual golf holes. What they don't bring is the perspective that everyone who plays golf isn't out there trying to shoot their career best."
Large destination courses are still being built, but many course designs these days are renovations -- and they often lack the budget of a large, tournament-focused club like Wentworth.
"The pendulum has swung toward architects because most of the market is being driven by remodeling," Michael Hurdzan, whose course designs include Erin Hills in Wisconsin, which hosted the U.S. Open in 2017, said. "That means you're going into an existing facility and fixing someone else's mistakes with a limited amount of time, a limited amount of money and 300 critics who are members. It takes a lot of time, a lot of hand holding."
One such example is the Medalist Golf Club, in Hobe Sound, Fla. It's a tough, popular course among pros. When it was built, Norman was given top billing as the architect, with Pete Dye second. But when the club underwent a renovation, Weed, who has worked closely with Dye, was called in to do the work.
Some pros understand that their skills lie elsewhere in a project.
Mathew Goggin, who played in 279 events on the PGA Tour, is developing Seven Mile Beach, a golf course in his hometown, Hobart, Australia. But he is clear that being a professional golfer does not make him a great architect.
"I'm smart enough to know that I'm not smart enough to design a course," he said. "You let the design team do what they do. I think you're doing a disservice to golf-course architecture unless you really do it. I have no expertise in it whatsoever. What am I going to say? 'Move that bunker over there?"'
And good architects know what to listen to. Goggin said he complimented the architect, Mike DeVries, for creating what even Goggin thought was a really hard hole at Seven Mile Beach. DeVries listened and redesigned it. He wasn't building it for a PGA Tour pro.
Goggin said he used his reputation as a great golfer from the area to push the project along. "I used my profile to get a meeting with the government ministers," he said. "I showed them the success of Barnbougle Dunes [a course in Tasmania], and we talked about how destination golf has an economic impact."
There are advantages architects get from working with pros that they can't get elsewhere. Doak designed Memorial Park with Brooks Koepka, and the course hosts the Houston Open on the PGA Tour. With the help of Koepka, a great ball striker, it was much easier for Doak to see his vision come to life.
"On the resort courses or the member course, you visualize the shot you expect to see -- and you sometimes wait months to see it," he said. "At a course for a tour event, you really only have to wait two or three groups to see it."

DETROIT — The Detroit auto show kicked off this week with a burst of hoopla and glam, including a Darius Rucker concert sponsored by Ford Motor and an indoor test track built by Jeep that features a hill with a 40-degree slope.
But beyond the excitement and bright lights, Detroit’s annual auto show has been clouded by foreboding and dread. The three established U.S. automakers, the anchors of the show, are locked in difficult contract negotiations with the labor union that represents nearly 150,000 of their employees.
Even as automakers sought to drum up excitement about new versions of popular vehicles such as the Ford F-150 pickup truck and the GMC Acadia SUV to journalists, analysts and dealers, labor negotiators were racing to avoid a strike by the United Auto Workers that could make it impossible for those new models to make their way to showrooms.
The three automakers based in the Detroit area — General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Chrysler and Ram — are entangled in their greatest labor crisis in more than a decade even as they seek to display their best and brightest new models.
“You can feel it,” said Matt DeLorenzo, an independent auto analyst and author. “The executives I’ve talked to, you can see they’re concerned. I don’t see a lot of optimism that it’s going to be resolved fairly quickly.”
The UAW and its new president, Shawn Fain, are seeking a 40% increase in wages over the next four years. The union has also demanded pension improvements, a shorter workweek, company-paid health care for retirees and an end to a wage system in which new hires start at about half the top union wage of $32 an hour.
The automakers, which have been making near-record profits for the past several years, have countered with wage increases about half of what the union is seeking, while rejecting most of the UAW’s other demands.
“We’re seeing movement from the companies, but they’re still not willing to agree to the kinds of raises that will make up for inflation on top of decades of falling wages,” Fain said Wednesday evening in a video on Facebook.
He added that workers at all three companies were prepared to strike and stay away from their factory stations as long as it took to win big gains. The UAW has never struck the three companies simultaneously before.
There were few direct references to the UAW talks at the show, which will open its doors to the general public Saturday. But a prolonged strike will almost certainly jeopardize the automakers’ plans to roll out new cars and trucks to take advantage of still strong demand.
The auto industry has spent much of the past three years struggling to produce enough vehicles because of pandemic shutdowns and supply chain chaos. The inventory of new cars remains very low by historical standards, and prices are quite high, helping to raise profits.
If striking workers slow or stop production lines for many weeks or several months, customers looking for new cars will increasingly turn to foreign automakers or Tesla, the Texas-based producer of electric vehicles that is growing fast. Those other automakers operate U.S. plants that use nonunion workers and their production is unlikely to be affected directly by the strikes.
The Detroit show, officially the North American International Auto Show, was once one of the premier auto expositions in the world. The top executives from all major automakers, including those not based in Michigan, attended. Celebrities and musicians were often hired to add sizzle.
But several years ago, attendance began declining at auto shows around the world, and the Detroit organizers tried to refashion theirs, moving it from January to the summer. But the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to shut down completely. The show returned last year, but was sparsely attended, and many foreign automakers didn’t bother to participate.
This year the no-shows include Honda, BMW, Volkswagen, Audi and Mercedes-Benz, but the show has added new attractions. A test track for electric vehicles has a 300-foot straightaway where visitors — riding in the passenger seat with a trained driver at the wheel — can get a sense of the exhilarating acceleration of seven models, including the electric Ford F-150 Lightning pickup and the Cadillac Lyriq, an electric SUV.
A startup company, Alef Aeronautics, put on display a concept for what it hopes will someday become a flying car that can “hop” over hills, or even traffic jams.
To highlight the off-road abilities of its vehicles, Stellantis’ Jeep division created a stand out of 50 pine trees, 30 tons of boulders and 40 cubic yards of dirt. There, amid the faux wilderness, Jeep introduced a new version of its Gladiator pickup.
“Even after 100 years, this city is still a home for innovating visionaries, designers, builders and adventure-seekers,” Jim Morrison, a Stellantis senior vice president and head of the Jeep brand in North America, said during a presentation Wednesday.
Hours later, Stellantis issued a statement saying it was still awaiting the UAW’s response to the company’s latest wage offer, and hoped to have a deal that would avert a strike.

BMW Plans to Build Electric Minis in Britain: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The move is a boost for Britain's car industry, but uncertainty remains about the sector's future in the country.
BMW said on Monday that it would invest 600 million pounds, or about $ 750 million, to build electric versions of its popular Mini car models in Britain.
The German manufacturer's move allays fears that the combination of Brexit and the shift to electric cars would pose a dire threat to automobile manufacturing in Britain, but questions over the sector's long-term future remain.
BMW's announcement is the third major piece of good news for Britain's beleaguered car industry in recent months. Tata Group, the owner of Jaguar Land Rover, said in July that it would spend £4 billion to build a battery plant in western England.
And last week, Stellantis, the leading maker of commercial vans in Britain, began producing electric-powered vans at its plant near Liverpool, after a £100 million investment.
The British government used the promise of subsidies to clinch BMW's investment, as it did to land Tata's commitment to build the battery plant. BMW said its investment was "supported" by Britain's government, but neither party provided details.
BMW said it would build two electric models at its factory in Oxford: a three-door Mini Cooper sedan and a small sport utility vehicle called the Mini Aceman.
There had been worries that BMW might shift all electric Mini production to China, but the move to continue producing the vehicles in Britain was not necessarily a surprise. With the future of the global car industry clouded by uncertainty over how the shift to electric vehicles will play out, analysts say it was logical to make what is a relatively modest investment by auto standards to keep making the cars in Britain for the next few years.
"To keep that plant running is a fairly sensible option," said Peter Wells, an auto industry specialist at Cardiff University in Wales.
After all, the Mini is a brand closely associated with Britain, where it originated in the middle of the last century. That heritage is likely to help sales. Almost 46,000 Minis sold in Britain in 2022.
BMW has already shifted some production of electric Minis to China. It now says the Oxford plant will move completely to making electric vehicles by 2030.
Shutting down the 110-year-old Oxford factory, where an electric Mini is already being built alongside conventional models, and paying severance costs, would probably have been expensive. It also might have proved unpopular with potential customers.
"Mini has always been aware of its history," Stefanie Wurst, the head of the brand for Mini, said in a statement.
Kemi Badenoch, Britain's business and trade secretary, called BMW's move "a big vote of confidence."
BMW says it employs about 4,000 people at the Oxford factory and at a site that makes components in Swindon, England. Last year, 186,000 Minis were made in Britain, third in overall numbers of cars produced, after Nissan and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW said that it would begin exporting the two new electric Mini models from China in 2024, as part of a joint venture it has with Great Wall Motor. Production of those models would not begin in Britain until 2026.
While the British car industry seems to have a stronger pulse than some analysts expected, recent investments largely represent moves by brands like Jaguar, Land Rover and Mini, which have strong associations with Britain. So far, Britain does not seem to be attracting investment from the likes of Tesla or Chinese vehicle makers.
The number of cars made each year in Britain roughly halved between 2015 and 2022. But for the first seven months of 2023, British car production was up 14 percent over the same period a year earlier.

Bond Issues Show Signs Of Optimism On Wall St.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The rush by companies to borrow comes as fears of a potential recession recede and executives expect interest rates to remain high.
Companies have rushed to borrow tens of billions of dollars this week, a sign that optimism about the outlook for the economy is beginning to take hold.
Dozens of big companies, from BMW to McDonald's, have issued close to $ 60 billion in bonds in recent days, according to Refinitiv. That sum nearly matches the value of dollar-denominated bonds issued over all of August, and marks the third-largest issuance in a week this year.
The post-Labor Day period is typically busy for bankers and traders as they return from summer vacations, but the sharp increase in bond issues in recent days has surpassed expectations, analysts said.
It's a sign of rising confidence that companies are willing to borrow rather than conservatively manage their debt loads, and investors are willing to lend rather than sit on cash, as concerns about a potential recession diminish.
"There is no question in my mind that the economy is slowing, but there is also no question that it's not going into recession," said Andrew Brenner, the head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities. "The window for companies to borrow is wide open right now."
The improving sentiment in the bond market echoes the rally in the stock market this year, as investors have become increasingly hopeful that the economy can achieve a so-called soft landing.
Despite the parallels in sentiment, the wave of bond issuance itself weighed on stocks this week. The bumper bond supply pushed bond prices lower, which raises yields. Stock prices are sensitive to increases in interest rates, such as bond yields, because it can raise costs for companies.
The S&P 500 was flat at the close on Friday but is still up more than 16 percent this year.
The dollar has gained about 5 percent over the past few weeks against the currencies of major trading partners, a sharp move in that market, suggesting that investors are piling into U.S. assets as growth in China falters and the outlook for Europe is underwhelming. Europe's benchmark Stoxx 600 index has fallen for eight consecutive days.
This week, analysts at Goldman Sachs lowered their forecast probability of a recession in the United States to just 15 percent. A recent survey of investors conducted by Bank of America showed an increase in respondents who want companies to employ more expansive strategies, spending on growth rather than reining in costs and paying down debt.
Some analysts also attributed the rise in bond issuance this week to the potential for borrowing costs to rise further in the months ahead, as the Federal Reserve considers whether to increase interest rates again. And even if the Fed leaves rates alone, a relatively strong economy also makes the prospects for eventual rate cuts more distant.
This week also presented a rare window without the U.S. government flooding markets with newly issued debt, making companies that need to raise cash able to get deals done sooner rather than later.
"There remains more of a conservative mind-set than I think there need be," said Jonny Fine, who runs investment-grade debt issuance at Goldman Sachs, speaking about the highest-quality, most creditworthy companies. "As a result, a large number of companies want to be first in the queue when supply is expected to be heavy."
The borrowing binge has also begun to extend to riskier, lower-rated companies, another sign of optimism among investors about the economy.
Still, credit ratings downgrades and defaults picked up in August, according to S&P Global, leading the rating agency to raise its forecast for the share of lowly rated companies that will renege on their debts over the next year in the United States, to 4.5 percent from 3.2 percent over the past year.
The bond uptick also comes as analysts and investors point to a looming "maturity wall," with some borrowers closing in on deadlines to refinance low-interest bonds if they want to avoid having to repay the debt in full when it comes due.
"Companies have been postponing this unpleasant transition to high borrowing costs but we are getting to this window where time is running out," said Yuri Seliger, a credit analyst at Bank of America.
However, a number of companies are avoiding locking in high interest rates for lengthy periods, with many recent bonds carrying much shorter repayment timelines than usual, giving companies flexibility to lower their costs if interest rates fall in the coming years.
"It makes sense," Mr. Seliger said. "If interest rates are really high right now, why do I want to lock that in for 30 years?"

U.S. to Recall A Key Part For Airbags: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The action covers airbags made by two companies and used by 12 automakers from 2000 to 2018. The parts were linked to seven injuries and one death.
Federal auto safety regulators moved Tuesday toward a recall of about 52 million airbag inflaters used by a dozen major carmakers, calling the parts unsafe and susceptible to rupture.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration scheduled a public meeting on Oct. 5 on its recommendation to recall the airbags, manufactured by ARC Automotive and Delphi Automotive Systems. ARC rejected the agency's initial findings that its airbags were defective.
The agency said that at least seven people had been injured and one killed in seven incidents in the United States as a result of the defective airbags.
Of the 52 million airbags, 41 million were manufactured by ARC and 11 million were produced by Delphi using a design licensed by ARC. The airbags were variously made in China, Mexico and Knoxville, Tenn., and were used by a dozen major carmakers: BMW, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Stellantis, Tesla, Toyota and Volkswagen.
"An airbag inflater that fails by rupture not only does not perform its job as a safety device, but instead actively threatens injury or death, even in a crash where the vehicle occupants would otherwise have been unharmed," the agency said in its announcement.
ARC and Delphi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The ARC matter comes several years after the safety agency's investigation of inflaters made by Takata, a Japanese supplier, that were found to explode violently and suddenly, even when the airbags were not deployed in a crash. In that case, regulators determined that Takata used a propellant that could break down over time from exposure to humidity.
The safety agency linked the Takata defect to more than a dozen deaths in the United States. More than 70 million vehicles equipped with Takata inflaters were recalled in more than 40 countries.
In April, the safety agency demanded in a letter to ARC that the company recall tens of millions of airbag inflaters that were made from 2000 to 2018.
The agency's investigators found that a small number of inflaters designed by ARC could explode more violently than intended when a vehicle's airbags are deployed, and therefore "pose an unreasonable risk of death or injury," the letter said.
The letter prompted G.M. to recall nearly one million vehicles made from 2014 to 2017 and equipped with ARC inflaters. The automaker said it was taking the action "out of an abundance of caution."
In response to the agency's demand, ARC declined to issue a recall and said in a letter in May that it did not believe a defect existed and that in its view NHTSA's finding was not based on "any objective technical or engineering conclusion."
Inflaters use an explosive substance such as ammonium nitrate that is compacted into tablets stored in a metal cylinder. In a crash severe enough to set off a vehicle's airbags, the tablets are supposed to create a controlled explosion that rapidly fills the airbags with gas.
The safety agency said it had found that ARC's manufacturing process could leave bits of welding material, known as weld slag, inside the cylinder. If the airbags are deployed, that material could clog the exit opening and cause an explosion violent enough to blast shards of metal and plastic into the vehicle's interior.
The agency has been looking at ARC inflaters since 2015. The most recent incident involving a rupture occurred in Michigan in March, when the driver of a 2017 Chevrolet Traverse sustained facial injuries.
ARC, in its letter to regulators in May, said that weld slag had been ruled out as the cause of two of the seven incidents noted by the agency, and that it had not yet been found definitively to be the cause of the other five.
A large-scale recall, and any related legal expenses, could have considerable costs for the inflater makers. After the Takata recall, the largest in automotive history, which forced it to pay millions of dollars in fines to U.S. regulators, the company filed for bankruptcy in 2017 and was sold to Joyson Safety Systems, formerly known as Key Safety Systems.
Takata had been responsible for the cost of replacing the defective inflaters -- a task handled by local car dealerships -- but the bankruptcy filing left automakers to pick up the bill. About 11 percent of the affected airbags still haven't been replaced, according to the safety agency's most recent estimate.
The agency has come under scrutiny for its investigations of vehicle defects. In May the Department of Transportation's inspector general issued a report concluding that the agency's Office of Defects Investigations did not identify and investigate safety defects in a timely manner.

In Munich, China's Cars Outperform Germany's: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: China, an electric-vehicle juggernaut, will have at least seven brands on display, while Germany's automakers are now a drag on their home economy.
For decades, the phrase "Made in Germany" signaled cutting-edge automotive technology and design. But now German automakers are falling behind in the global race to produce more electric vehicles, and some executives are using a new catchphrase to describe how quickly they need to catch up: "China speed."
The term reflects the rapid transformation of the Chinese car industry into a battery-powered juggernaut. And that speed was on display Monday at I.A.A. Mobility, a massive auto show in Munich, with newcomers from China stealing the show.
BYD, an all-electric Chinese carmaker that overtook Volkswagen as China's best-selling brand this year, unveiled a sleek, new sedan and a sport utility vehicle to applause from a packed crowd.
"I think the Europeans are just pretty much petrified of how the Chinese will perform in Europe," said Matthias Schmidt, an independent analyst of the electric-car market based in Berlin.
The show arrives at a precarious time for the German auto industry, the largest in Europe, and for the German economy more broadly. Once a critical driver of the country's economy, German automakers have instead become a drag. In June, production in the auto industry shrank by 3.5 percent compared with the previous month, weighing on the country's overall industrial production, which declined by 1.5 percent.
The doldrums extend beyond automakers. Economic output in Germany is stagnating, weighed down by the high cost of energy and raw materials, a lingering effect of Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year.
Prominent German companies, including Volkswagen and the chemical giant BASF, have delayed expansion plans or announced that they will build in regions with enticing incentives, including China and North America. Persistently high inflation is eating away at Germans' purchasing power and contributing to pessimism from consumers and businesses alike.
After Germany's economy dipped into a recession late last year and early this year, its growth was flat from April to June. Last week, the country's central bank, the Bundesbank, said that economic output was expected to "more or less stagnate again in the third quarter of 2023."
Among eight advanced economies studied by the International Monetary Fund, Germany's was the only one projected to shrink this year, leading some economists to recall the specter of the late 1990s when, hampered by record-high unemployment and the cost of reunifying East and West Germany, economists declared the country the "sick man" of Europe.
The government in Berlin is rushing to respond. Last week, it approved 32 billion euros, or almost $ 35 billion, in corporate tax cuts over four years to help revive production.
The government also proposed cutting Germany's notorious mounds of paperwork for businesses, for example by accepting digital, not paper, copies of official documents in an attempt to drag it into the digital age. A recent survey of 500 companies showed that fax machines remained in use as the most secure form of communication.
Compare that to HiPhi (pronounced "hi-fi"), a luxury car company from China that was founded in 2019. It is now producing the third version of its tech-heavy electric vehicles, with doors that glide open at the push of a button, and lights on the outside and inside of the doors that can flash and change colors. The cars are now selling in Germany and Norway, starting at 105,000 euros, or $ 113,000, and were on display at the auto show.
The ability to produce the car so quickly is linked to a different approach to the auto business, said Mark Stanton, the company's chief technology officer.
"The fear of failure is huge and that mentality really becomes a roadblock in your everyday process of what you do," Mr. Stanton said. "We completely wipe that away."
One of the leading factors worrying companies in Germany is the persistently high price of energy.
For decades, Germany prided itself on its steady supply of power that kept factories producing steel and cars humming. But the source of that power was natural gas piped in from Russia, and Germans refused to consider other suppliers.
After Moscow halted the flow of natural gas to Germany a year ago as a consequence of Berlin's support for Ukraine, the price of gas more than quadrupled, forcing many companies to scale back production. Although prices have fallen, they remain nearly twice as high as they were in 2021.
The whiplash has cost companies that require high amounts of energy, like chemical makers, a sense of security for long-term planning, an annual survey of businesses showed. The study, conducted by the German Chambers of Commerce and Industry, found that confidence in the government's energy policy was at its lowest point in more than a decade.
"After the energy price shock at the end of last year and the relatively mild winter, companies are deeply concerned about future developments," said Achim Dercks, the organization's deputy general manager.
That fear is causing many German industrial firms to reconsider previously planned investments. Earlier this year, Volkswagen decided to scrap plans to build a second battery factory in Germany.
The company is already building one battery factory in Salzgitter, near its headquarters in Wolfsburg, and another in Valencia, Spain. This spring, Volkswagen announced that it had chosen Ontario as the site for its first battery plant outside Europe, lured by lucrative incentives and industrial power prices roughly one-third cheaper than in Germany.
Lowering energy prices by just 1 cent per kilowatt-hour can translate to an annual difference in cost of up to 100 million euros when producing batteries for electric vehicles, Oliver Blume, Volkswagen's chief executive, said in an interview with the German public broadcaster ZDF.
"If we look at the prices we are currently being offered in North America or in other regions of the world, Germany is a long way off," Mr. Blume said.
Volkswagen is not alone in looking abroad to expand its electric vehicle production capacity. Earlier this year, BMW, which is based in Munich, announced it would invest €800 million in Mexico to produce high-voltage batteries and its new fully electric models. Those cars are expected to go into production in 2025 at the company's plant in Hungary.
In China, German automakers' failure to meet the growing demand for battery-powered vehicles left a vacuum, which domestic automakers quickly moved to fill, producing affordable and attractive electric cars that are taking over their home market.
Volkswagen is making moves to improve its position in China. Last month, it announced that it would invest $ 700 million for a nearly 5 percent stake in XPeng, a Chinese start-up that makes electric vehicles, in an effort to help it meet the demands of the Chinese market.
But now Chinese automakers have their eyes on Europe, where gas-fueled cars are to be banned in 12 years.
At the auto show on Monday, traditional German automakers presented plans for expanding production of all-electric vehicles in the coming years, but manufacturers from China revealed new models they were bringing to the European market.
"Europe is a strategic market for BYD," said Michael Shu, managing director of BYD Europe. Last month, he said, his company became the first automaker in the world to deliver five million fully electric or hybrid vehicles.
Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, director of the Center Automotive Research in Duisburg, Germany, described this year's auto show as a "Zeitenwende," or turning point -- the same term used by Chancellor Olaf Scholz when pronouncing Germany's transition in foreign policy after Russia invaded Ukraine.
"A Zeitenwende, that sees Europe becoming an interesting market for Chinese electric vehicles," he said. "The competition will be tougher."

Why a Swift Coup Caught Gabon's Leader Off-Guard: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Hailed as a climate visionary, Gabon's president, Ali Bongo Ondimba, was once welcomed to Buckingham Palace but was blindsided by this week's coup.
As the all-powerful ruler of oil-rich Gabon, Ali Bongo Ondimba had two passions, music and forests, that forged powerful ties across the world.
An accomplished musician, Mr. Bongo recorded a disco-funk album and lured James Brown and Michael Jackson to Gabon. As president, he built a music studio at his seaside palace and played improv jazz to foreign diplomats at state dinners.
More recently, Mr. Bongo allied with Western scientists and conservationists, entranced by both the paradisiacal beauty of Gabon, an Arizona-sized country covered in lush rainforest and teeming with wildlife, and by his commitment to protecting it.
But to his own people, Mr. Bongo, 64, embodied a family dynasty, founded by his father, which had dominated Gabon for 56 years -- until this week, when it came crashing down.
Military officers seized power on Wednesday, hours after election officials declared Mr. Bongo the winner of a disputed election last weekend. Few saw it coming, not least the president. When his own guards came for him, Mr. Bongo seemed genuinely bewildered.
"I don't know what's going on," Mr. Bongo, speaking from his home, said in a video that was authenticated and circulated by some of his many Western advisers. "I'm calling on you to make noise."
It was the latest in a blaze of military takeovers of African countries, toppling weak governments. ("Déjà coup," said one analyst from Sudan, which had its own coup in 2021.) But while other takeovers were prompted by violent upheaval, in peaceful Gabon it was something else: A sign that the Bongo rule, which held fast for a half-century, had run its course.
There was no sign of Mr. Bongo on Thursday, a day after his plaintive cry for help. The coup leader Gen. Brice Oligui Nguema -- a cousin of Mr. Bongo -- announced he would be sworn in as "transitional president" next Monday.
Other African leaders, fearing they might be next, took precautions. In neighboring Cameroon, President Paul Biya -- in office for 40 years and, at age 90, the world's oldest serving leader -- announced a sudden reshuffle of his country's military leadership. So, too, did Rwanda, which like Gabon has for decades been ruled by one man.
As Mr. Bongo's fate hung in the balance, reactions differed. Foreign conservationists expressed worries about what comes next for a country that worked so hard to preserve its pristine forests and seas. Recently, Gabon negotiated a landmark $ 500 million debt refinancing deal that freed $ 163 million for marine protection.
"A power vacuum could lead to a free-for-all where poaching, illegal logging and deforestation increase," said Simon Lewis, a professor of global change science at University College London, who has advised Gabon on climate policy. "The prospect of the Gabonese people gaining major income from their forests could evaporate."
In Libreville, Gabon's crowded seaside capital, the verdict was more mixed. "I am free!" cried Alaphine, a young woman in a crowd of coup supporters who declined to give a surname. But Christopher Ngondjet, a 25-year-old law student, said he felt torn.
He welcomed a change from the Bongos, he said, but worried about military rule. "The president did a lot of good things, especially with the environment," he said. "I don't know if the generals will have the same interest."
In many ways, Gabon has more in common with some Persian Gulf states than with its African neighbors. It has a tiny population of 2.3 million people, huge oil wealth and a country that is sparsely inhabited; 88 percent of the land is forest and roads are few.
As oil prices soared in the last quarter of the 20th century, the Bongo family reigned like an undeclared monarchy. President Omar Bongo took power in 1967 and became a close ally of France, Gabon's former colonial ruler. By most estimates, he fathered at least 53 children with different women, a means of cementing political alliances.
After Omar Bongo died in 2009, the torch passed to Ali, one of his seven "official" sons, who won the presidential election that year.
The Bongos loved the baubles of super wealth -- the Bentleys, the Parisian villas, the vacations on the Côte d'Azur. Ali Bongo frequently rode around Libreville in a Rolls-Royce and socialized with King Mohammed of Morocco, an old friend who has a private palace in Gabon.
French investigators accused Mr. Bongo and his family of corruption. But what distinguished their country from nearby oil-rich kleptocracies, like Equatorial Guinea, was that some wealth also flowed down.
Education and health care levels are significantly higher in Gabon than elsewhere in the region. Gifted students are sent to France on government scholarships. Its timber industry provides 30,000 jobs, largely thanks to Mr. Bongo's insistence that value be added in Gabon, not abroad.
With its orderly markets and palm-lined corniche, Libreville lacks the constant chaos of neighboring capitals. The U.S. Agency for International Development classifies Gabon as a middle-income country.
Certainly, poverty is rife: a report by McKinsey in 2013 estimated that 30 percent of Gabonese lived on $ 140 a month. Yet even in the poorest parts of Libreville living conditions are better than in much of the region.
Mr. Bongo's kitchen cabinet is filled with Western advisers who stroll through government offices and in one case was appointed a minister: Lee White, a British-born scientist, who since 2019 has been minister of water, forests, the sea and environment.
About 15 years ago, Mr. Bongo began focusing on the country's forests -- home to western lowland gorillas, forest elephants, chimps and mandrills, and part of the Congo Basin, one of the world's most important carbon sinks.
Omar Bongo, created 13 national parks covering 10 percent of Gabon's landmass, and Ali Bongo continued that passion. He flew by helicopter to his private reserve, where he kept lions, tigers, cheetahs, cougars and leopards.
He became a regular at international climate conferences, and courted powerful, wealthy allies. Last year King Charles, who has praised Mr. Bongo's policies, welcomed him to Buckingham Palace. On a visit to Gabon, Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, pledged $ 35 million for forest preservation.
Mr. Bongo's advocacy was partly driven by self-interest. It burnished his foreign image and opened doors to a potential fortune in carbon credits -- billions of dollars that Mr. Bongo has urged the West to pay Gabon to help preserve its rainforests.
But foreign officials who met Mr. Bongo said his soft-spoken, genteel manner could vanish as he enthused about nature. In a 2016 interview with the Times, Mr. Bongo reminisced about growing up with a pet Siberian tiger and gushed over his current pets in the presidential reserve. "There are so many," he said, ticking off the names of some of his lions, Goliath and Greta, and a cheetah called Sahara.
But Mr. Bongo's system began to show cracks. After the financial crash of 2008, a fall in oil prices hit Gabon hard. As the economy slumped, inequality grew more pronounced.
The fleets of Mercedes and Rolls-Royce cars that rolled through the small streets of the capital, parking at fancy seafood restaurants or outside the president's palace, began to jar more than usual.
In forest communities, farmers complained that growing numbers of hungry elephants -- a direct result of Mr. Bongo's anti-poaching efforts -- were eating their crops. Despite oil revenues, they complained, passable roads barely existed outside the capital. "Let the elephants vote for him," was a slogan of critics during the 2016 election.
In that vote, Mr. Bongo bared his knuckles to stay in power. In his strongholds, voter turnout was an improbable 99 percent. Security forces encircled the opposition party headquarters and at least one person was killed.
Daniel Mengara, founder of the exiled opposition group Bongo Must Go, said oil revenues did help Gabon's people, but the Bongos skimmed off too much. "We deserve better than what we've got and what we've got is misery," he said.
In 2019 Mr. Bongo suffered a stroke and disappeared for 10 months, re-emerging with a cane. His relationship with France faltered: He welcomed Chinese and other investment, and last year Gabon joined the British Commonwealth.
Since 2020, a series of coups has shaken West Africa: first in Mali, then Burkina Faso, Guinea, Sudan and, last month, Niger. Despite threats and sanctions from African and Western powers, none was reversed.
President Bola Tinubu of Nigeria warned of a "contagion of autocracy," with emboldened soldiers in other countries deciding they should take over, too.
Few imagined Mr. Bongo was in immediate danger. But then he pushed ahead with a contentious election, and the coup makers, led by his own cousin, brought contagion to his door.

Full text: Many carmakers and charging companies are switching to the Tesla plug for electric vehicles. Why are they doing that, and what will it mean?
With a push from Congress, automakers and charging companies are planning to install tens of thousands of fast chargers on American highways capable of refueling electric cars in half an hour or less.
That's good news for anyone who owns an electric car or is thinking about buying one. But it's also confusing because of a debate about what kind of plugs those new chargers and cars will use now and in the future.
Ford Motor, General Motors, Mercedes-Benz and other automakers plan to abandon the plugs their electric cars use today for those designed by Tesla. But they won't begin selling cars with the Tesla plugs until 2025.
Until then, cars like the Ford Mustang Mach-E or Chevrolet Bolt will come with technology that may eventually become obsolete, the equivalent of Betamax videocassette recorders.
What plugs do electric cars use today?
There are two main kinds of plugs. The most widely used was developed by Tesla, which dominates the electric car business, and, so far, works only with the company's cars. It's known as the North American Charging Standard.
Cars made by most other manufacturers use a plug known as the Combined Charging System. Any electric car charger that is funded in part by the federal government under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has to be able to charge cars that use the CCS plug.
Many established automakers are switching from CCS to the North American plug, which will allow their owners to use a portion of Tesla's network of fast chargers -- 12,000 -- and feel more confident about finding a place to refuel. Tesla has roughly 20,000 fast chargers in the United States, or about two-thirds of such chargers.
The established manufacturers will offer adapters that allow Tesla chargers to deliver power to cars with CCS receptacles in early 2024. Then, in 2025, new cars sold by the automakers will use Tesla plugs without adapters.
With so many big automakers switching to the Tesla standard, CCS's days might be numbered in the United States. Of course, cars built for CCS plugs will stay on the road for years, which means that charging stations will need adapters or offer both kinds of plugs for the foreseeable future.
Why are automakers switching to the Tesla plug?
Established carmakers are switching to Tesla's system mainly because it is more widespread than what they are using today and appears to work better.
Tesla's charging network is often found in locations that don't have CCS chargers. Many auto experts and drivers also say Tesla chargers are more reliable, and the company's plug is smaller, lighter and easier to handle than the CCS plug.
In addition, Tesla has designed its system so that drivers can plug into one of its chargers and walk away. The chargers recognize each Tesla car and bill its owner's credit card automatically.
The performance of the charging networks operated by other companies is notoriously uneven. Charging procedures vary. Some chargers require drivers to plug in and then open an app on their phones. Others want customers to open an app first. Some chargers accept credit cards, but others don't.
Drivers of electric cars that are not Teslas often complain about broken or finnicky chargers -- complaints validated by independent studies.
How much does charger location matter?
It matters a lot.
Perhaps Tesla's biggest advantage is that it has been at this for a long time. It has secured choice locations at popular shopping centers and along busy highways.
As a result, newer charging companies are often at a disadvantage. Many of them have had to place some chargers in areas that lack restrooms or restaurants. Stopping at some chargers, in empty parking lots, can feel unsafe.
In July, BMW, G.M., Honda and four other automakers announced that they would jointly install 30,000 chargers in the United States and Canada. These chargers will have both plugs.
Does the CCS plug have any advantages?
Yes, these plugs can charge any electric car, including Teslas if drivers are carrying adapters, which often come with their cars.
But the reverse is not true -- the vast majority of Tesla chargers can charge only Teslas. Elon Musk, the Tesla chief executive, said in February that he intended to open his company's charging network to cars made by other automakers. As of late August, only about a dozen of the company's U.S. charging stations, all in California, New York or Texas, were available to other cars.
CCS technology is not dominated by one company. While Tesla has promised to hand oversight of its plug to an independent body, the company and Mr. Musk have often been confrontational when dealing with other businesses and government agencies. That's why some auto experts believe that established automakers could regret relying on Tesla.
While charging companies that offer CCS plugs have struggled to offer reliable and easy-to-use services, there are many of them. Several, including EVgo and Electrify America, operate nationwide and compete with one another on price and service. Tesla is more insulated from competition, though that will change as more companies offer chargers with the plugs its cars use.

Labor Groups Target Hyundai — and Biden — Over Transition to Electric

A coalition of labor unions and civic groups in Georgia and Alabama will launch a pressure campaign on Monday targeting Hyundai’s electric vehicle plants and its clean energy suppliers, an effort that could also push the Biden administration to make good on its oft-repeated pledge to create not just jobs but “good union jobs.”
By focusing on the shift to electric vehicles at Hyundai, a nonunion carmaker expected to reap huge benefits from Biden’s prized initiatives, the coalition hopes to make inroads at other automakers, such as BMW in South Carolina and Mercedes-Benz in Alabama, which similarly chose union-hostile territory for their U.S. manufacturing bases.
The campaign could also raise the heat on domestic automakers in the middle of contract negotiations with the newly aggressive United Automobile Workers, who are focused on raising wages at electric vehicle suppliers like battery makers.
For Biden, the Hyundai campaign has political ramifications, in setting specific demands on one of the largest automakers in the world in one of the most important swing states in the 2024 presidential election, Georgia.
“The people in the community should be able to come to work in these plants, with a livable wage and good jobs,” said Yvonne T. Brooks, president of the Georgia state AFL-CIO, adding that “to bring jobs here but not provide a livable wage kind of defeats the purpose.”
Biden has campaigned on the sheer number of jobs created by his three signature laws, a $1 trillion infrastructure package, a $280 billion measure to rekindle a domestic semiconductor industry, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which included $370 billion for clean energy to combat climate change. A $25 million advertising blitz announced by his campaign last week kicked off with a one-minute spot that proclaims, “Manufacturing jobs are coming home,” and “America is leading the world in clean energy.”
But despite low unemployment, tempering inflation and steady job creation, Biden’s overall approval ratings have been dragged down by voters’ refusal to give him credit for the good economic news. Clifford Young, who oversees U.S. public opinion research at Ipsos, a polling company, said that last year’s 8.5% inflation and the ensuing interest rate hikes and slower economic growth might have sealed Biden’s fate with the voting public.
“The dirty secret is a bad economy hurts a president more than a good economy helps,” he said.
White House officials, who were notified of the Hyundai effort ahead of time, said Thursday that Biden fully backs the aims of the coalition in Georgia. And labor leaders have generally supported Biden as the most pro-union president ever.
But in a notable shift, those leaders also say the volume of jobs created on his watch might not be enough to win worker loyalties if those jobs are low-paid, dangerous and insecure. That is especially true if substandard jobs are underwritten by the taxpayer.
“I know the president can’t make stipulations that all new jobs have to go to union workers, but there have to be fair labor standards for jobs that are supported by tax dollars,” said David Green, the United Automobile Workers’ regional director for Ohio and Indiana. “Members are a little frustrated with it. It’s our tax dollars, too.”
Such concerns have led the UAW to withhold its endorsement of Biden as the union’s new leadership threatens to strike over wages and benefits at electric vehicle suppliers. Biden has responded with support, tapping a senior adviser and Democratic veteran, Gene B. Sperling, as liaison between the union and the automakers and backing the UAW this month in contract negotiations.
But union leaders are worried about the transition that Biden has set in motion with his push to address climate change with federal money funding the shift from fossil fuels. They are pressing automakers shifting to electric vehicles to “honor the right to organize,” take necessary steps to avoid plant closings, and provide training programs to help workers transition into new jobs at comparable wages.
A letter to the chief executive of Hyundai’s American subsidiary, José Muñoz, signed by coalition members including the UAW, the AFL-CIO, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (which is particularly close to Biden), and religious, community and environmental groups, maps key labor demands.
Such letters, demanding “community benefits agreements” enforced with binding arbitration systems, have been trotted out in the past to little effect. But union leaders said the Hyundai effort is more focused and forward-looking, hinting at the strategy of organizers in the South as unions across the country have become much more aggressive.
The letter pushes for Hyundai and its subsidiaries to hire locally, train workers from the communities around the plants, bolster safety standards, and protect the environment around the plants, which are expected to employ more than 30,000 Georgians and Alabamians. Of those, 12,750 are expected to work at or around Hyundai’s new electric vehicle “megasite” in Bryan County near Savannah, the largest economic development project in Georgia’s history.
The coalition is seeking a binding agreement modeled on one reached last year with the electric bus maker New Flyer, which promised, among other things, that at least 45% of new hires and 20% of promotions would be women, minorities and U.S. military veterans.
“These facilities will transform our communities, and we are faced with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to ensure that this transformation is for the best,” the coalition wrote, demanding that Hyundai and its suppliers come to the bargaining table to make “highroad commitments to workers and their communities.”
A spokesperson for Hyundai USA, Michael Stewart, said in a statement that the company’s “top priority is the safety and well-being of the more than 114,000 individuals we employ, directly and indirectly, whose market-leading skills and expertise are driving America’s auto industry forward.”
Daniel Flippo, director of the United Steelworkers southeast district, cautioned that community agreements might not have the teeth of union contracts.
At a recent meeting with Energy Department officials about the electric vehicle transition, Flippo said, he told them, “Look, all this going in to protect workers and worker rights looks good on paper, but if you don’t follow up, it shouldn’t be up to the union organizers to do it for you.”
Democrats secured a raft of provisions in Biden’s three signature laws to encourage labor organizing, raise wages and favor union apprenticeships and training programs. In May, the administration used those provisions to apply pressure to a Georgia electric bus company, Blue Bird, and support workers trying to unionize its Fort Valley, Georgia, plant. The United Steelworkers won that vote.
Flippo credited a rule in the electric school bus grants that said no federal money could be used to oppose union organizing, such as in hiring union-busting law firms during an organizing drive.
“They did use some of those tactics,” he said, “but all we had to say was we were going to notify the government and request an audit of where their money was going, and it went away.”
The Biden administration has had some successes with clean energy companies, securing commitments by a Danish wind energy giant to use union labor on its offshore wind projects and by a North Dakota metals company to stay neutral in any union drive at its new battery plant.
But union leaders have only so much influence over the rank and file — and against the pull of Donald Trump, who has made working-class appeals central to his political movement. Green pointed to the former president’s promise to revive a General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, by enticing an untested startup to buy the facility. That startup, Lordstown Motors, filed for bankruptcy protection in late June.
“I will not, could not support any endorsement of Donald Trump,” he said. “But we’ve got a lot of members. Do I think that Trump’s rhetoric is contagious among our members? Absolutely.”

Full text: The mayor was peak Eric Adams on his trip, keeping a frenzied schedule, checking out police drones, enjoying Tel Aviv's nightlife and shaking off the haters.
When Mayor Eric Adams of New York City faces the familiar question about why he goes out on the town so often, he offers a standard defense: He says his enthusiastic presence at nightclubs and restaurants helps boost a multibillion dollar industry.
Apparently the mayor chose to follow a similar practice on his trip to Israel.
On a whirlwind three-day visit, Mr. Adams dined at the Whiskey Bar and Museum in Tel Aviv, a sleek restaurant with more than 1,000 types of whiskey. He danced and banged a drum at Jerusalem's rowdy Mahane Yehuda Market. He was photographed with the son of an Israeli billionaire as he enjoyed Tel Aviv's buzzing nightlife scene.
Mr. Adams may have been thousands of miles away from home, but was still very much himself: high energy, highly quotable, spiritual, ideologically to the right of many Democrats in his party, wary of the press, fond of police drone demonstrations and foremost a foodie.
The trip gave Mr. Adams some distance from a series of pressing challenges in New York City, allowing him to focus on preferred topics, like his ties to the Jewish community, public safety and courting business.
Much of his schedule was filled with events not open to journalists, even though members of the City Hall press corps were in Israel to cover the mayor. The names of those he met at private events were typically not disclosed, and he held only two media briefings, neither of them in person.
One moment that unintentionally went viral was his visit to the Western Wall in Jerusalem, where he was photographed with his hand pressed to the wall, his right wrist adorned with a beaded bracelet that spells out "HUSTLE."
Even though Mr. Adams has worn the bracelet since at least November 2021, it was seen as a surprising, if jarring, juxtaposition: a holy site dating back more than 2,000 years alongside a modern slogan that the mayor lives by.
Other facets of the mayor's personality were on display during the trip. Mr. Adams, a health enthusiast who wrote a book about his plant-based diet, grilled a chef about the fat, carb and sugar contents of the vegan burgers and kebabs he was presented during his meeting with the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. At a lunch to showcase Israeli food companies, he appeared to nibble on a bite of grouper before realizing that it was, in fact, fish -- part of a pattern of straying from his mostly vegan diet.
On Wednesday night in Tel Aviv, the mayor dined with Asaf Zamir, a former Israeli consul general in New York at whose wedding Mr. Adams officiated in June. Mr. Zamir thanked Mr. Adams on Instagram for visiting the city's nightlife.
The mayor kept his order simple: a plain salad with a sweet potato, without salt or oil, Mr. Zamir said. They discussed many topics, he said, including pollution, crime, outdoor dining and affordable housing.
Mr. Adams, a former police officer, delighted in a demonstration of police technology at Israel's National Police Academy that included two officers riding a BMW motorcycle holding a large gun in the air, and a futuristic drone that Mr. Adams said was superior to New York's technology.
"One thing that really caught my eye was utilizing motorcycles and drones together, something that we have not been using in the city to immediately get to your location," Mr. Adams said.
Still, even as he celebrated Israel's security apparatus, Mr. Adams conceded that some tactics would not be palatable back home: "Some countries, Israel and others, use technology that just will not fit in America's belief on privacy," he said.
Mr. Adams has said that he sleeps only four hours a night, and that seemed to be the case in Israel, where he kept a relentless schedule. The mayor was whisked around Jerusalem and Tel Aviv in a phalanx of black SUVs -- similar to the way he moves about New York City. Mr. Adams's new deputy mayor for communications, Fabien Levy, declined to say whether the mayor took either city's light rail system.
Mr. Levy was more direct in his response to the city comptroller, Brad Lander, who questioned the mayor's decision not to visit Palestinian families in the West Bank.
"Since you asked, the mayor met with Palestinians, Ethiopian Jews, organizers in the protest movement and more over the last two days," Mr. Levy responded on X, the website formerly known as Twitter.
In Israel, the mayor continued his practice of promoting private companies, including F2 Venture Capital, a venture capital firm that works in artificial intelligence and big data; Aleph Farms, a food technology company that is preparing to seek regulatory approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; and Egg'n'Up, a start-up that makes plant-based eggs.
He also attended a "business leaders round table" hosted by the Bank of Israel; Mr. Levy would not provide a list of the attendees.
Wherever the mayor goes, the powerful and wealthy want to be near him. On his night out in Tel Aviv, Mr. Adams was photographed with Gil Ofer, the son of the Israeli billionaire Idan Ofer, and Said Abulafia, a member of another wealthy family.
By appearing with the prime minister, Mr. Adams aligned himself with more conservative Democrats and Netanyahu loyalists back home. Some left-leaning Jewish groups urged him to challenge Mr. Netanyahu during their meeting over his efforts to weaken the judicial system, but Mr. Adams said he did not want to get involved.
And the mayor, as always, provided intriguing commentary. Some of his quotes have become memes, such as "my haters become my waiters when I sit down at the table of success," while others raise more questions than they answer.
Mr. Adams has said that he wanted to retire in Israel, possibly in the Golan Heights, a fertile plateau beside the Sea of Galilee that Israel annexed unilaterally but Syria still claims. When a reporter asked him in Israel if he did indeed plan to retire there, the mayor said that it was on a short list of eight places, along with Senegal and Nigeria and "a few more I want to keep secret so the press won't be able to find me when I retire."
Before leaving town, Mr. Adams told tech leaders that the country could overcome its current challenges, using a metaphor that was open to interpretation.
"Israel is a unicorn," he told them.

Gran Turismo Drove a Teenager to Prominence: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The PlayStation video game's realistic cars and racetracks helped Jann Mardenborough find his calling as a professional driver.
Jann Mardenborough can vividly recount the first time he ever played Gran Turismo, the popular racing video game that would completely alter his life.
While seeking refuge on Bonfire Night, a British holiday full of firework celebrations, an 8-year-old Mardenborough stumbled upon the game at his neighbors' house. He selected a violet Mitsubishi 3000GT and began racing on the Autumn Ring track. Mardenborough went on to play the game all night, and then every day after that, showing up at his neighbors' door immediately after school.
"They got so fed up with me turning up at their house, one day the wife came across the street, knocked on our door and had in hand the PlayStation and GT 1, and gave it to my parents," the 31-year-old racecar driver recently recalled during a video interview.
It's the origin story to the other origin story: the true, improbable one depicted in the film "Gran Turismo," which was directed by Neill Blomkamp and opens on Friday. The movie dramatizes Mardenborough's journey, from gaming in his bedroom to winning the 2011 GT Academy -- an annual competition that, from 2008 to 2016, put the game's best players in real vehicles -- to driving formula cars professionally.
The eight main games in the Gran Turismo franchise, which debuted in Europe and North America in 1998, are known for their scrupulously reproduced cars and exacting racing simulations. In the months before he attended GT Academy, Mardenborough upgraded from a plastic PlayStation controller to a homemade wooden racing frame along with a steering wheel and pedal that he bought with money his parents gave him for good grades.
The competition was a godsend for Mardenborough, who was trying to sell car parts on eBay after losing a retail job; he had dropped out of college after realizing that studying motor sport engineering did not mean he could actually drive the cars.
Even so, Mardenborough said he was skeptical of his chances. He had played Gran Turismo no more than an average teenage gamer after his initial fixation, had never competed in a tournament and had barely any experience driving a normal car. The first time he brought his rickety 1991 laser blue BMW E30 onto a highway was on his way to the competition.
Mardenborough's perspective took a visceral turn when he qualified for racing camp -- a stretch depicted in the film that follows the finalists training in actual cars -- and was given his first taste of the track.
"After my first few laps, when I got out the car, I remember thinking, 'I don't want to go through life never experiencing that again,"' said Mardenborough, who served as a producer on "Gran Turismo" and as the stunt double for his own character.
Mardenborough can eagerly describe the technicalities that distinguish game from reality -- the sensation, for instance, of the vibration through the car seat -- but said that much of the real-world feeling and reactions mirrored Gran Turismo.
"When you race against real people," he said, "everything is real."
Mardenborough, who is played by Archie Madekwe in "Gran Turismo," went line by line with Sony over early drafts of the script, which he noted is mostly true to his life. The characters played by David Harbour and Orlando Bloom are both fictionalized but loosely based on real people. And a crash involving Mardenborough in Germany that left a spectator dead really happened, although detractors have complained about how the tragic event was translated to the screen.
In the film, the crash occurs right before Mardenborough returns to the track for a podium finish at Le Mans, the famous endurance race in France -- back-to-back events that form an emotional arc of setback and triumph. In reality, Mardenborough's crash in Germany came two years after that podium finish, leading to criticism that the film's timeline was edited to serve a narratively pat movie ending.
"The order is the order, but those events happened in my life," Mardenborough, who avoided serious injuries, said in response. "This isn't a documentary." He did race in Le Mans one year after the crash, and Mardenborough said the emotional battle the film constructed was consistent with his feelings.
"When you believe the reason why you're put on earth is to race a racing car, and then you're asking yourself, 'Do I still want to do this?"' he said. "It's not a pleasant question to ask."
Mardenborough last competed in May and is talking to teams about potentially racing in the United States next year. And occasionally, the driver who fidgeted with a gaming steering wheel during our interview will still play Gran Turismo.
If he were to race against his 19-year-old self in the game right now, who would win? Mardenborough thought for a moment.
"Me," he said with a competitive smirk. "If I put in the amount of hours I did back then, considering my experience in real life, I would be quicker. But all it is is hours."

TEL AVIV, Israel — When Mayor Eric Adams of New York City faces the familiar question about why he goes out on the town so often, he offers a standard defense: He says his enthusiastic presence at nightclubs and restaurants helps boost a multibillion-dollar industry.

It's a Surprisingly Speedy Shift: [SpecialSections]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The United States is pivoting away from fossil fuels and toward wind, solar and other renewable energy, even in areas dominated by the oil and gas industries.
Delivery vans in Pittsburgh. Buses in Milwaukee. Cranes loading freight at the Port of Los Angeles. Every municipal building in Houston. All are powered by electricity derived from the sun, wind or other sources of clean energy.
Across the country, a profound shift is taking place that is nearly invisible to most Americans. The nation that burned coal, oil and gas for more than a century to become the richest economy on the planet, as well as historically the most polluting, is rapidly shifting away from fossil fuels.
A similar energy transition is already well underway in Europe and elsewhere. But the United States is catching up, and globally, change is happening at a pace that is surprising even the experts who track it closely.
Wind and solar power are breaking records, and renewables are now expected to overtake coal by 2025 as the world's largest source of electricity. Automakers have made electric vehicles central to their business strategies and are openly talking about an expiration date on the internal combustion engine. Heating, cooling, cooking and some manufacturing are going electric.
As the planet registers the highest temperatures on record, rising in some places to levels incompatible with human life, governments around the world are pouring trillions of dollars into clean energy to cut the carbon pollution that is broiling the planet.
The cost of generating electricity from the sun and wind is falling fast and in many areas is now cheaper than gas, oil or coal. Private investment is flooding into companies that are jockeying for advantage in emerging green industries.
"We look at energy data on a daily basis, and it's astonishing what's happening," said Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency. "Clean energy is moving faster than many people think, and it's become turbocharged lately."
More than $ 1.7 trillion worldwide is expected to be invested in technologies such as wind, solar power, electric vehicles and batteries globally this year, according to the I.E.A., compared with just over $ 1 trillion in fossil fuels. That is by far the most ever spent on clean energy in a year.
Those investments are driving explosive growth. China, which already leads the world in the sheer amount of electricity produced by wind and solar power, is expected to double its capacity by 2025, five years ahead of schedule. In Britain, roughly one-third of electricity is generated by wind, solar and hydropower. And in the United States, 23 percent of electricity is expected to come from renewable sources this year, up 10 percentage points from a decade ago.
"The nature of these exponential curves sometimes causes us to underestimate how quickly changes occur once they reach these inflection points and begin accelerating," said former Vice President Al Gore, who called attention to what he termed a "planetary crisis" 17 years ago in his film "An Inconvenient Truth." "The trend is definitely in favor of more and more renewable energy and less fossil energy."
Even as the pace of change in the United States is surprising everyone from energy experts to automobile executives, fossil fuels still dominate energy production at home and abroad.
Corporations are building new coal mines, oil rigs and gas pipelines. The government continues to award leases for drilling projects on public lands and in federal waters and still subsidizes the industries. After posting record profits last year, leading oil companies are backing away from recent promises to invest more heavily in renewable energy.
The scale of change required to remake the systems that power the United States -- all the infrastructure that needs to be removed, re-engineered and replaced -- is mind-boggling. There are major challenges involved in adding large amounts of renewable energy to antiquated electric grids and mining enough minerals for clean technologies. Some politicians, including most Republicans, want the country to continue burning fossil fuels, even in the face of overwhelming scientific consensus that their use is endangering life on the planet. Dozens of conservative groups organized by the Heritage Foundation have created a policy playbook, should a Republican win the 2024 presidential election, that would reverse course on lowering emissions. It would shred regulations designed to curb greenhouse gases, dismantle nearly every federal clean energy program and boost the production of fossil fuels.
And while energy systems are changing fast, so is the climate. It is far from certain whether the United States and other polluting countries will do what scientists say is required to avert catastrophe: stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere by 2050. All of the investment so far has slowed the pace at which emissions are growing worldwide, but the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere is at record levels.
And yet, from Beijing to London, Tokyo to Washington, Oslo to Dubai, the energy transition is undeniably racing ahead. Change is here, even in oil country.
'Energy Is Energy'
As the workday begins in Tulsa, Okla., the assembly line at the electric school bus factory rattles to life. Crews fan out across the city to install solar panels on century-old Tudor homes. Teslas and Ford F-150 Lightnings pull up to charging stations powered in part by the country's second-largest wind farm. And at the University of Tulsa's School of Petroleum Engineering, faculty are working on ways to use hydrogen as a clean energy source.
Tulsa, a former boomtown once known as the "Oil Capital of the World" where the minor league baseball team is the Drillers, is immersed in a new energy revolution.
At the port, an Italian company, Enel, is building a $ 1 billion solar panel factory. The bus factory is operated by Navistar, one of the biggest commercial vehicle makers in the world. And the city's main electric utility, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, now harvests more than 28 percent of its power from wind.
Clean energy entrepreneurs are flocking to Oklahoma, too. Francis Energy, a fast-growing maker of electric vehicle charging stations, is based in Tulsa. Canoo, an electric vehicle start-up, is building a 100,000-square-foot battery factory at a nearby industrial park and a manufacturing plant for its trucks in Oklahoma City, though there are questions about whether the company will have enough funding to realize its plans. And teams from Solar Power of Oklahoma are busy fastening photovoltaic panels to the roofs of homes and businesses around Tulsa.
The city is embracing its shifting identity.
"We have a tremendous sense of pride in our history," said Dewey F. Bartlett Jr., the Republican former mayor of Tulsa who was an oil and gas executive but now helps recruit clean energy companies to the region. "But we also understand that energy is energy, whether it is generated by wind, steam or whatever it might be."
Around the country, clean energy is taking root in unlikely locales.
Houston, home to more than 500 oil and gas companies, also has more than 130 solar- and wind-related companies. Some of the country's largest wind and solar farms are in the Texas flatlands outside the city, and a huge wind farm has been proposed off the coast of Galveston.
In Arkansas, a planned solar farm -- the state's biggest -- is expected to help power a nearby U.S. Steel factory that is undergoing a $ 3 billion upgrade. When complete, the plant will use electric furnaces to mold scrap steel into new products. That will result in about 80 percent less greenhouse gases, the company says, and set the pace for an industry that has been a major polluter.
About two-thirds of the new investment in clean energy is in Republican-controlled states, where policymakers have historically resisted renewables. But with each passing month, the politics seem to matter less than the economics.
"We're the reddest state in the country, and we're an oil and gas state," said J.W. Peters, president of Solar Power of Oklahoma. "So it took a lot of time to convince people that this wasn't snake oil."
Mr. Peters was broke six years ago, with less than $ 400 in his checking account after his contracting business slowed down. Then he responded to a help-wanted ad looking for workers to install solar panels, which were becoming more popular in Tulsa. He now employs 61 workers and has $ 18 million in annual sales. "The environmental benefits are nice," he said, "but most people are doing this for the financial opportunity."
'Something Very Dramatic'
Fifteen years ago, solar panels, wind turbines and battery-powered vehicles were widely viewed as niche technologies, too expensive and unreliable for mainstream use.
But clean energy became cheap far faster than anyone expected. Since 2009, the cost of solar power has plunged by 83 percent, while the cost of producing wind power has fallen by more than half. The price of lithium-ion battery cells fell 97 percent over the past three decades.
Today, solar and wind power are the least expensive new sources of electricity in many markets, generating 12 percent of global electricity and rising. This year, for the first time, global investors are expected to pour more money into solar power -- some $ 380 billion -- than into drilling for oil.
The rapid drop in costs for solar energy, wind power and batteries can be traced to early government investment and steady improvements over time by hundreds of researchers, engineers and entrepreneurs around the world.
"The world has produced nearly three billion solar panels at this point, and every one of those has been an opportunity for people to try to improve the process," said Gregory Nemet, a solar power expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. "And all of those incremental improvements add up to something very dramatic."
An equally potent force, along with the technological advances, has been an influx of money -- in particular, a gusher since 2020 of government subsidies.
In the United States, President Biden signed a trio of laws during his first two years in office that allocated unprecedented funds for clean energy: A $ 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law provided money to enhance the power grid, buy electric buses for schools and build a national network of electric vehicle chargers. The bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act set aside billions of dollars for semiconductors vital to car manufacturing. And the Inflation Reduction Act, which marks its first anniversary on Aug. 16, is by far the most ambitious attempt to fight climate change in American history.
That landmark law provided tax breaks related to electric vehicles, heat pumps and energy efficiency upgrades, solar panel and wind turbine manufacturing and clean hydrogen production. The government is also investing in efforts to capture carbon emissions and store them before they can reach the atmosphere, as well as technology that can remove them directly from the air.
Originally estimated to cost roughly $ 391 billion between 2022 and 2031, the tax breaks are proving so popular with manufacturers and consumers that estimates now put the cost as high as $ 1.2 trillion over the next decade.
Combined, the three laws have prompted companies to announce at least $ 230 billion in manufacturing investments so far. In Georgia, a Korean solar manufacturer, Qcells, is building a $ 2.5 billion plant. In Nevada, Tesla is building a new $ 3.6 billion electric truck factory. And in Oklahoma, the Enel and Canoo facilities are primed to benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act, as is a new $ 4.4 billion battery factory being considered by Panasonic, the Japanese conglomerate.
"There's a lot of appetite to invest in the United States thanks to that law," said Giovanni Bertolino, an executive at Enel, adding that the plant his company is building in Tulsa would not exist without the Inflation Reduction Act.
Regulations are also hastening the energy transition. Mr. Biden has proposed tough new federal pollution limits on tailpipes and smokestacks, but several states are acting on their own. California, with market muscle that influences the entire auto industry, plans to halt sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035 and new diesel-powered trucks by 2036 -- and a handful of states are following suit. In May, New York became the first state to ban gas hookups in most new buildings, requiring all-electric heating and cooking starting in 2026. Several cities, including New York and San Francisco, have similar prohibitions, although some Republican-controlled states have blocked their municipalities from banning gas.
Heavy investment by the United States has spurred a spirited reaction from other wealthy nations. Countries that initially complained that the United States was unfairly subsidizing clean energy manufacturers have since engaged in a sort of friendly subsidy race.
Canada, South Korea and others have pushed for their companies to have better access to the American incentives, while offering similar subsidies to their domestic manufacturers. After Russia invaded Ukraine last year, the European Union moved to lessen its dependence on Russian oil and gas. In May, for the first time ever, wind and solar power in the E.U. generated more electricity than fossil fuels.
And in China, which is currently both the world's top polluter and the global leader for renewable power, the government continues to invest in every stage of clean energy production, from solar cells to batteries, wind turbines and more. Like the United States, China provides subsidies to buyers of electric vehicles. Last year it spent $ 546 billion on clean energy, far more than any other country in the world.
With costs falling fast, manufacturing has picked up and installations of solar and wind projects have increased. The U.S. solar industry installed a record 6.1 gigawatts of capacity in the first quarter of 2023, a 47 percent increase over the same period last year.
And those low costs have led many of the United States' biggest corporations, such as Alphabet, Amazon and General Motors, to purchase large amounts of wind and solar power, because it burnishes their reputations and because it makes good economic sense.
"We're seeing the nonlinear change happen before us," said Jon Creyts, chief executive of RMI, a nonprofit organization that promotes the energy transition. "And that's important, because we're facing a climate crisis right now."
'A National Phenomenon'
Steve Uerling's Tulsa home is a model of energy efficiency. He replaced all his incandescent light bulbs with LEDs. He installed a heat pump and rooftop solar panels this year. And he drives a plug-in hybrid Ford Fusion and a Tesla Model 3.
Mr. Uerling, a mechanical engineer, said he wanted to see renewable power take off in Oklahoma and was trying to do his part. But he was also driven by his wallet.
"My fuel cost is equivalent to getting 200 miles a gallon on gasoline," he said. "We charge at night, when we get a much cheaper rate on our electricity."
Millions of people around the country are making similar calculations. Electric vehicles are by far the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry, with record sales of 300,000 in the second quarter of 2023, a 48 percent increase from a year earlier. Teslas are now among the best-selling cars in the country, and Ford has expanded its production of the F-150 Lightning, the electric version of its popular pickup truck, after a surge of initial demand created a waiting list.
Concerns among consumers about the availability of charging stations as well as the cost of some models have helped to cool sales somewhat, leading some automakers to slash prices. Still, federal tax credits of up to $ 7,500 have made the least expensive electric vehicles competitive with gas-powered cars. And about two dozen states offer additional tax credits, rebates or reduced fees, further pushing down their cost.
Government action is also helping heavier vehicles go electric. Sales of electric school buses are soaring, largely because of $ 5 billion in federal grants that can cover 100 percent of the cost for low-income communities. The Postal Service plans to spend nearly $ 10 billion to purchase 66,000 electric mail trucks -- roughly 30 percent of its fleet -- over the next five years.
In the private sector, Amazon has ordered 100,000 electric delivery trucks from Rivian. Tesla has an electric semitruck, as do several other manufacturers, including Peterbilt.
Companies that provide charging stations are springing up to meet the demand. Francis Energy has more than 400 chargers across Oklahoma and is expanding nationwide. EVgo, which has one of the largest fast-charging networks in the United States, plans to more than double the 3,000 charging stalls it operates.
"It is not a red-state, blue-state thing," said Cathy Zoi, EVgo's chief executive. "It is a national phenomenon."
In an unusual move, seven carmakers -- BMW Group, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz Group and Stellantis -- are spending $ 1 billion in a joint venture to build 30,000 charging ports on major highways and other locations in the United States and Canada.
The shift is happening so quickly that some of America's most iconic automakers are preparing for a world beyond gasoline-powered cars and trucks.
General Motors, which has the largest market share of any carmaker in the United States, has committed to selling only zero-emissions vehicles by 2035. It's a "once-in-a-generation inflection point" for the 114-year-old automaker, according to Mary Barra, G.M.'s chief executive.
In an interview, Ms. Barra said her company began to consider an all-electric future in 2020. "We started to see this happening with the consumer research we did," said Ms. Barra, who has subsequently bet billions on G.M.'s efforts to reorient its engineering, overhaul its manufacturing facilities and processes and build new battery plants.
As the cost of batteries comes down, and the number of charging stations nationwide goes up, Ms. Barra expects exponential growth. "I think it's going to be definitely an upward trajectory," she said. "It'll be a little bumpy, but bumpy growing."

Full text: But if you want to hear what he has learned about lost promise and the prison of yearning, ask him. He'll talk to anybody.
It was a lazy, humid weekday afternoon at Citi Field, and the early birds were taking a steam bath. Ed Kranepool, an original Met, was on the field near the Mets dugout, shaking hands, making the scene. Charlie Hayes, the old Yankee third baseman, was sitting on a cushioned field-level seat near third base. In a few hours, his son, Ke'Bryan Hayes, would be playing third and batting third for the visitors, the Pittsburgh Pirates. Nearby, on the field in foul territory, Jay Horwitz, Mets PR man since 1980, was doing the Jay Horwitz Pregame Shuffle, toes out, head bobbing, checking on this, checking on that.
It only seemed like Old-Timers' Day.
And then, three hours or so before the night's first pitch, an icon of New York baseball strolled into this summer-in-the-city scene. Darryl Strawberry, his own self. Forty years ago he was a Mets rookie with a 30-inch waist and about six feet of shoulders. For a long time, Strawberry wasn't an active Mets alumnus, but under the team's newish ownership -- Steven A. Cohen, take a rare bow in this dismal season! -- Strawberry has been coming around, at least now and again. The owner remembers Strawberry in his prime. He roots for him as all New Yorkers root for him. Darryl Strawberry -- there was always something about him. You could see it in his face.
Strawberry can't tell you much about the Mets' left-handed bats off the bench. His life in baseball has come and gone. But he knows and appreciates the doors baseball opened for him, and he was at the ballpark on that recent night to meet and greet some big-check donors to the foundation he runs with his wife, Tracy Strawberry. Among other things, the foundation helps pay for treatment programs for addicts of every kind. Strawberry knows such programs intimately. So does his wife. Tracy Strawberry is an ordained minister, has a doctorate in theology and, like her husband, is an addict in recovery.
"Seventy-eight, Jay?" Strawberry said. It was Jay Horwitz's birthday, not that he wanted anybody to know. "Man. Happy birthday, Jay."
Strawberry is tall as ever at 61, with a slight paunch, but with the same bashful smile and powerful arms and how-you-doin' manner that made him an adopted son in Queens (eight years with the Mets) and the Bronx (five with the Yankees) and across the city's three other boroughs, plus Long Island and North Jersey and the parts of Connecticut that New York claims as its own.
Horwitz looked up at Strawberry, a member of the Mets Hall of Fame, though his number has not been retired. Strawberry looked good. He's been clean and sober for -- he doesn't put a date to it, like some in recovery do. "Ever since I found God," he'll tell you. He'll talk to anybody.
Strawberry watched the Pirates-Mets game from an open-air private suite where passing fans could snap photos of him or ask him to sign things, his 2.0 reading glasses perched on the top of his shaved head all the while. The suite's owner, a self-made building-services entrepreneur named Michael Rodriguez, stood beside Strawberry and said, "If you walk into a room, and Darryl Strawberry says, 'M-Rod!,' there's no better feeling." Connecting with people is more than a personality trait for Strawberry. It's almost a calling. At Strawberry's invitation, Hayes was taking in the game from the suite, too, and when his son stroked an opposite-field single, Strawberry said, "Just like his daddy!"
When the Yankees won the 1996 World Series in six games over the Atlanta Braves, clinching it at Yankee Stadium, Hayes caught the final out. Strawberry, the Yankee left fielder, came dashing in to the victory pile. Dwight Gooden, who came up in the Mets organization alongside Strawberry, pitched for the Yankees in 1996 but wasn't on the postseason roster. Fatigue, the team said. They will always be linked, Strawberry and Gooden. Gooden's struggles with alcohol and drugs, money and relationships have been just as well documented as Strawberry's. But for New Yorkers of a certain age, Doc and Straw and all their long-ago promise is a feel-good dream that will not die. There's a certain wistful loveliness in all of that, the mind drifting to what could have been.
Darryl Strawberry has no holy roller in him. He's not trying to save you or to convert you. (Most of his friends are Jewish, he says.) There's no spittle coming out of his mouth when he cites Matthew or Abraham. He grew up in Los Angeles. He became a star in New York. He and Tracy live near St. Louis. In their blended family, they have nine children.
In recent years, Strawberry has been visiting churches, schools, hospitals -- and, most especially, prisons -- about 200 days a year. "I'm happiest when I go through a prison gate and I see people who might never see life outside again," he said. He sees himself in these people. He sees their promise. He was on his way to a late-summer Monday-night baseball game, but the game itself was about the last thing on his mind.
Strawberry was staying with a friend, Nelson Braff, in Demarest, N.J., and driving to Citi Field via the George Washington Bridge. His ride was a large, boxy BMW rental, with air conditioning he could not control. Braff is an owner of the Hunt & Fish Club, the Midtown restaurant popular with ballplayers of a certain standing and men with made-to-measure shirts. It's a world Strawberry knows. But he'll tell you he's more comfortable in a prison rec yard, and he means it.
"I preach hope," Strawberry said, a greater New York road map on the screen of his phone. He can talk baseball, of course, his electrifying at-bats in the Mets-Houston National League Championship Series in 1986, his .435 batting average during a brief comeback stint with the St. Paul Saints 10 years later, all of that. But spiritual comebacks and second chances are the themes that interest him most.
He sometimes makes these prison visits with his personal manager, John Luppo, a 56-year-old break-dancing, sports-mad Bronx native and a former Wall Street trader with his own harrowing story of addiction and a path to recovery that started with Strawberry. Luppo sets up the prison visits. The clearances and the bureaucracy can be daunting. Luppo is ill-suited to it. Still, he gets it done.
About five years ago, Len Vanden Bos, then the Chicago Bears chaplain (now the Buffalo Bills chaplain) asked Strawberry to join him on a visit to Louisiana State Penitentiary, the notorious but evolving maximum-security prison often called Angola. Angola is larger than Manhattan and has more than 6,000 prisoners. Vanden Bos had brought many N.F.L. players there, but Strawberry was the first former major leaguer.
Through Vanden Bos, Strawberry met an Angola inmate named Keith Morse, serving a life sentence for the 1994 shooting death of his son's aunt. Morse entered prison at age 19. He had been an outfielder at Airline High in Bossier City, La. He modeled his right-handed swing on Strawberry's left-handed one. The father of Albert Belle, the former American League slugger, was one of Morse's coaches. Dwight Gooden was one of his baseball heroes. None of that seemed to interest Strawberry.
"The first time he came in, there was nothing there," Morse said in a phone interview. "I thought, 'He doesn't like me."' But the second time, something clicked. Strawberry gave Morse signed baseball cards. "He said, 'What can I do for you?' I said, 'You can pray for me.' He said, 'What more can I do for you?"'
Strawberry wrote a letter to the Louisiana parole board on Morse's behalf. He sat with the victim's family, who supported Morse's release, at a parole hearing. Morse was released in 2020. He and Strawberry speak by phone now and again. "Keith has his ups and downs," Strawberry said. "Like all of us."
When Strawberry talks to inmates, he often finds himself sharing an observation with them: We're all prisoners, of a kind, whether you're doing life or chasing the high life. "I've seen so many people, successful people, athletes and celebrities, try to buy their way out of loneliness and emptiness with their credit cards, with drugs, with alcohol, at strip clubs," Strawberry said the other day. "I did it myself. You're still a prisoner." Enter God. Yes, that's where Strawberry's head is these days.
Strawberry said goodbye to M-Rod in his open-air Citi Field suite and left Flushing Meadows with the Mets batting in the fifth. Hayes was riding in the passenger seat as Strawberry pointed his chilly BMW rental west on Astoria Boulevard on a warm summer night in Queens. They talked about Doc. They talked about the car's climate control. They talked about the tacos at the Queens restaurant where Hayes was headed. Strawberry wasn't coming in.
"I've got to get home," Strawberry told his old teammate. They talked briefly about the upcoming Old-Timers' Day at Yankee Stadium, on Sept. 9. "I'll see you there, bro," Strawberry said.
Between now and then, Strawberry will be preaching hope wherever he finds himself. No spittle. No yelling. Just Darryl, talking about second chances. Just Darryl, on Darryl, when you get right down to it.

NEW YORK — It was a lazy, humid weekday afternoon at Citi Field, and the early birds were taking a steam bath.

Memorable Moments From the 1986 Postseason
OCT. 11, NLCS, GAME 3
Tying the Game
SHEA STADIUM — Trailing 4-0 in the bottom of sixth, the Mets were in danger of falling behind 2-1 in the series with star pitcher Mike Scott returning for Game 4. In that inning, after the Mets scored their first run, Darryl Strawberry hit a game-tying three-run home run off starter Bob Knepper, helping to the turn the series in the Mets favor. Lenny Dykstra hit a two-run walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth off closer Dave Smith.
OCT. 14, NLCS, GAME 5
A Big First Hit
SHEA STADIUM — The starters — Houston’s Nolan Ryan and the Mets’ Dwight Gooden — were locked in a classic duel between two of the best pitchers of that era. Gooden pitched 10 innings, allowing only one run and nine hits. Ryan also allowed one run, on only two hits. Down 1-0 in the fifth, Strawberry broke up Ryan’s bid for a no-hitter with a home run over the right field wall. In the bottom of the 12th inning, Gary Carter, who had been just 1-for-21 in the NLCS, singled to center to give the Mets a walk-off win and 3-2 series lead. The Mets won again the next day in Houston — 7-6 in 16 innings — capping off one of the most dramatic playoff series in baseball history.
OCT. 27, WORLD SERIES
Breathing Room
SHEA STADIUM — Many fans remember the heroics of Game 6, when the Mets were a strike away from being eliminated but came back with three runs in the bottom of the 10th to force a Game 7. Rain pushed the deciding game to Monday night, Oct. 27. With the Mets leading 6-5, Strawberry led off the bottom of the eighth with a home run deep to right field off Al Nipper, helping the Mets pull away and win their first championship since the 1969 Miracle Mets.

Full text: We used to breakdance -- put down our little cardboard, you know, the early days of Run-DMC blasting out the big speakers: "Peter Piper picked peppers." I remember just being a kid walking to the park and hearing it on the bass speakers. Like, it sounds foreign, something I'd never heard before in my life.
Just looking at how they were dressed -- leather gooses and Adidas and suede Pumas -- you really identify with that because that's what you saw dudes in the neighborhoods wearing. Before that, entertainers, you expect to see them in suits -- a little more like costumes.
My first album that I ever had was a Christmas gift, and it was "Follow the Leader." I remember running home from school to the closest spot we could get to -- it was, like, my boy's crib -- because they said the new Rakim video was coming out. The "Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em" video, dude sitting on the Rolls-Royce, it was like a damn movie.
Rakim presented hip-hop in a way where I felt like I could participate. It wasn't in your face with the showmanship. He was more cool and laid back. You could just tell he was rhyming with his inside voice, displaying intelligence. I felt like I could become an M.C.
I wasn't thinking about making songs. Back in the day, it was more like the cypher, battling, who got the best rhymes. At that age, you don't even have beats to make songs. I went to school with Busta's younger brother. I had a reputation around the town for rhyming. So when Busta was starting to develop his own label, when he was first starting Flipmode, he had reached out.
Being around Busta, I learned how hard it is to be successful in the entertainment business. He's literally like a cyborg. He doesn't sleep.
Like, he works every day, in the studio every single night, you know? I was, like, man, at what point do you celebrate being rich and famous? Success isn't a destination, it's a constant voyage.
The internet changed everything. People are sharing music and you can't keep things suppressed like you probably could at one point. You know, it only takes one person you like to post something that they like, and then bang, you know?
The transition when it became more about the internet really benefited me, because around that time I couldn't get a deal with a major label after my Flipmode situation. Like, OK, cool, we don't need the middleman anymore. We could just upload our music and just let the fans decide what they rocking with.
Not only me -- it's helped a bunch of us become heroes. My guy Bronson, Ka, Westside and Griselda, Hommy, Currensy -- I'd say I was instrumental in most of their start-ups. It's just mutual respect. Lil B, you know what I'm saying? That's definitely somebody I linked up with that probably people wouldn't have expected me to be a big fan of. I like that he's fearless.
Young Thug, too. When Thug came on the scene I was, like, Man, this dude's a genius. This is like James Brown 3000! I don't know what he's saying, I just know that sounds funky.
You know, living in New York City most of my life, I've never heard MF Doom on the radio once. And he's a legend. You could see the disconnect. Doom was doing this before all of us, this independent grind.
To a certain degree, I would say Long Island artists are slighted. Rakim, EPMD, De La Soul, MF Doom, myself -- it's a lot of heat coming out of Long Island, you know what I'm saying? And Prodigy is from Long Island. I feel like saying it's unsung would be untrue. But we definitely have a steeper hill to climb than maybe if we were from Brooklyn or Queens.

Full text: Justice Clarence Thomas met the recreational vehicle of his dreams in Phoenix, on a November Friday in 1999.
With some time to kill before an event that night, he headed to a dealership just west of the airport. There sat a used Prevost Le Mirage XL Marathon, eight years old and 40 feet long, with orange flames licking down the sides. In the words of one of his biographers, "he kicked the tires and climbed aboard," then quickly negotiated a handshake deal. A few weeks later, Justice Thomas drove his new motor coach off the lot and into his everyman, up-by-the-bootstraps self-mythology.
There he is behind the wheel during a rare 2007 interview with "60 Minutes," talking about how the steel-clad converted bus allows him to escape the "meanness that you see in Washington." He regularly slips into his speeches his love of driving it through the American heartland -- "the part we fly over." And in a documentary financed by conservative admirers, Justice Thomas, who was born into poverty in Georgia, waxes rhapsodic about the familiarity of spending time with the regular folks he meets along the way in R.V. parks and Walmart parking lots.
"I don't have any problem with going to Europe, but I prefer the United States, and I prefer seeing the regular parts of the United States," he told the filmmakers, adding: "There's something normal to me about it. I come from regular stock, and I prefer being around that."
But there is an untold, and far more complex, back story to Justice Thomas's R.V. -- one that not only undercuts the mythology but also leaves unanswered a host of questions about whether the justice received, and failed to disclose, a lavish gift from a wealthy friend.
His Prevost Marathon cost $ 267,230, according to title history records obtained by The New York Times. And Justice Thomas, who in the ensuing years would tell friends how he had scrimped and saved to afford the motor coach, did not buy it on his own. In fact, the purchase was underwritten, at least in part, by Anthony Welters, a close friend who made his fortune in the health care industry.
He provided Justice Thomas with financing that experts said a bank would have been unlikely to extend -- not only because Justice Thomas was already carrying a lot of debt, but because the Marathon brand's high level of customization makes its used motor coaches difficult to value.
In an email to The Times, Mr. Welters wrote: "Here is what I can share. Twenty-five years ago, I loaned a friend money, as I have other friends and family. We've all been on one side or the other of that equation. He used it to buy a recreational vehicle, which is a passion of his." Roughly nine years later, "the loan was satisfied," Mr. Welters added. He subsequently sent The Times a photograph of the original title bearing his signature and a handwritten "lien release" date of Nov. 22, 2008.
But despite repeated requests over nearly two weeks, Mr. Welters did not answer further questions essential to understanding his arrangement with Justice Thomas.
He would not say how much he had lent Justice Thomas, how much the justice had repaid and whether any of the debt had been forgiven or otherwise discharged. He declined to provide The Times with a copy of a loan agreement -- or even say if one existed. Nor would he share the basic terms of the loan, such as what, if any, interest rate had been charged or whether Justice Thomas had adhered to an agreed-upon repayment schedule. And when asked to elaborate on what he had meant when he said the loan had been "satisfied," he did not respond.
"'Satisfied' doesn't necessarily mean someone paid the loan back," said Michael Hamersley, a tax lawyer and expert who has testified before Congress. "'Satisfied' could also mean the lender formally forgave the debt, or otherwise just stopped pursuing repayment."
Justice Thomas, for his part, did not respond to detailed questions about the loan, sent to him through the Supreme Court's spokeswoman.
The two men's silence serves to obscure whether Justice Thomas had an obligation to report the arrangement under a federal ethics law that requires justices to disclose certain gifts, liabilities and other financial dealings that could pose conflicts of interest.
Vehicle loans are generally exempt from those reporting requirements, as long as they are secured by the vehicle and the loan amount doesn't exceed its purchase price. But private loans like the one between Mr. Welters and Justice Thomas can be deemed gifts or income to the borrower under the federal tax code if they don't hew to certain criteria: Essentially, experts said, the loan must have well-documented, commercially reasonable terms along the lines of what a bank would offer, and the borrower must adhere to those terms and pay back the principal and interest in full.
Richard W. Painter, a White House ethics lawyer during the George W. Bush administration, said that when it comes to questions of disclosure, the ethics treatment of gifts and income often parallels the tax treatment. But those intricacies aside, he said, "justices just should not be accepting private loans from wealthy individuals outside their family." If they do, he added, "you have to ask, why is a justice going to this private individual and not to a commercial lender, unless the justice is getting something he or she otherwise could not get."
The Times's unearthing of the loan arrangement is the latest in a series of revelations showing how wealthy benefactors have bestowed an array of benefits on Justice Thomas and his wife, Virginia Thomas: helping to pay for his great-nephew's tuition, steering business to Mrs. Thomas's consulting firm, buying and renovating the house where his mother lives and inviting the Thomases on trips both domestic and foreign that included travel aboard private jets and a yacht.
Justice Thomas has pointed to interpretations of the disclosure rules to defend his failure to report much of the largess he has received. He has said he was advised that the trips fell under an exemption for gifts involving "personal hospitality" from close friends, for instance, and a lawyer close to the Thomases contended in a statement that the justice did not need to disclose the tuition because it was a gift to his great-nephew, over whom he had legal custody, rather than to him.
The Thomases' known benefactors include wealthy men like the Dallas real estate developer Harlan Crow, the conservative judicial kingmaker Leonard Leo and several members of the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans, which honors people who succeed despite adversity. Among them: the longtime Miami Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga, who flew the justice around on his jet.
Mr. Welters, while also a Horatio Alger member, stands apart. For one thing, the two men's friendship predates Justice Thomas's time on the federal bench. They met around 1980, when both were members of a small, informal club of Black congressional aides to Republican lawmakers -- Mr. Welters worked for Senator Jacob K. Javits of New York and Justice Thomas for Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri.
"It wasn't exactly fashionable to be a Black person working for a Republican, and it was comforting to meet others in the same boat," the justice wrote in his autobiography, "My Grandfather's Son."
They had much in common. Like Justice Thomas, Mr. Welters was raised in poverty, sharing a cramped tenement in Harlem with his parents and three brothers and, after his mother's death when he was 8, shining shoes under an elevated subway to help make ends meet.
As both men climbed the ladder as political appointees in the Reagan administration, their friendship grew. They stayed close after Justice Thomas joined the federal appeals court in Washington in 1990 and Mr. Welters left government to found AmeriChoice, a Medicaid services provider that he sold to UnitedHealthcare for $ 530 million in stock in 2002 and continued to lead until retiring in 2016. Mr. Welters and his wife, Beatrice, named Justice Thomas the godfather of one of their two boys, according to The Village Voice.
When Justice Thomas's 1991 Supreme Court nomination ran into trouble after a former subordinate, Anita Hill, accused him of sexual harassment, Mr. Welters stood by his friend, providing behind-the-scenes advice, according to a book on the hearings written by Mr. Danforth.
And in 1998, the year before the motor coach purchase, Justice Thomas returned the favor. That is when Mr. Welters and his wife, through their foundation, started the AnBryce scholarship program, which gives underprivileged students a full ride to New York University's law school, along with networking opportunities and career support. Justice Thomas lent his considerable imprimatur to the program, interviewing applicants in his Supreme Court chambers, mentoring scholars and later hiring one graduate as a clerk.
By that point, the justice had become fixated on owning an R.V., and not just any R.V., but the Rolls-Royce of motor coaches: a custom Prevost Marathon, or as he once put it, a "condo on wheels."
A Toy for the Rich
Justice Thomas was turned on to the luxury brand by Bernie Little, a fellow Horatio Alger member and the flamboyantly wealthy owner of the Miss Budweiser hydroplane racing boat. Mr. Little had owned 20 to 25 custom motor coaches over the years, Mr. Thomas told C-SPAN in 2001.
Back in those days, a basic Prevost Marathon sold for about a million dollars, and could fetch far more depending on the bells and whistles. It was a rich man's toy, and the company marketed it that way.
"You drive through a neighborhood in South Florida and you see these $ 10 million homes," Bob Phebus, Marathon's vice president, told The South Florida Business Journal in 2006. "You condense that down, put it on wheels and that's what we have. It's the same guy that will have a 100-foot yacht and a private aircraft. They're accustomed to the finer things in life."
At the time, the Thomases' primary source of income was the justice's salary, then $ 167,900. He had yet to sell his autobiography, and property and other records show that the couple had significant debt: They had purchased their house in 1992 for $ 552,000 with 5 percent down, then refinanced it two years later, taking out a 15-year mortgage of $ 496,000. Plus, they had at least one line of credit of between $ 15,000 and $ 50,000.
So, in Justice Thomas's telling, he began searching for a used Prevost at Mr. Little's suggestion, one with enough miles on it to depreciate the value. "The depreciation curve -- it's very steep," he made a point of saying in the 2001 C-SPAN interview.
All these years later, he still hasn't told some of his closest friends how he was really able to swing the purchase.
"He told me he saved up all his money to buy it," said Armstrong Williams, a longtime friend who worked closely with Justice Thomas in the Reagan administration.
The title history documents reviewed by The Times show that when the motor coach was sold for $ 267,230 to the Thomases in 1999, it had only 93,618 miles on it, relatively few for a vehicle that experts say can easily log a million miles in its lifetime. It came equipped with plush leather seating, a kitchen, a bathroom and a bedroom in the back. In addition to its orange flame motif, it had a large Pegasus painted on the back, according to Jason Mang, the step-grandson of the previous owner, Bonnie Owenby.
"It was superluxury, really bougie," he recalled.
On Nov. 19, 1999, after spotting the motor coach on the lot of Desert West Coach in Phoenix and putting a hold on it, Justice Thomas attended a dinner at the conservative Goldwater Institute. In a speech that night, he said he had never yearned to be a federal judge. "Pure and simple, I wanted to be rich," he said.
Wayne Mullis, the owner of the now-defunct Desert West, said in an interview that Justice Thomas never discussed obtaining traditional financing with him, and that "as far as I know, he paid for it."
Indeed, Justice Thomas would have been hard-pressed to get a loan from a traditional lender. Banks, and even finance companies that specialize in R.V. loans, are particularly reluctant to lend money on used Prevost Marathons because the customized features are hard to value, according to three leading industry executives interviewed by The Times.
"As a rule, the majority of buyers are cash buyers -- they don't finance the Prevost, generally," said Chad Stevens, owner of an Arizona-based dealership specializing in high-end motor coaches, whose clients include celebrities and politicians. "In 1999, you would need a very strong down payment and a strong financial portfolio to finance one. It is a luxury item."
While the terms of Mr. Welters's loan to Justice Thomas are unclear, rules governing loans of more than $ 10,000 between friends and family are not.
Loans can be reclassified as gifts or income to the borrower, either of which would have to be reported by the justice under court disclosure rules, if any portion of the debt is forgiven or discharged as uncollectable. But even if a lender does not take those steps, a loan can still be considered a reportable gift or income if it doesn't meet certain standards.
Loan terms should be spelled out in a written agreement, with a clearly defined, regular repayment schedule, tax experts said. Lenders must charge at least the applicable federal interest rate, which was a little over 6 percent in December 1999, when the deal to buy the motor coach closed. And if a borrower is in arrears, lenders must make a good-faith effort to collect, even to the point of going to court.
"Absent that, it's more of a gift," said Rich Lahijani, tax director of Edelman Financial Engines, an independent wealth planning and investment advisory firm.
The title history records held by the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles do not contain detailed information about the loan itself. What they show is that when the Thomases drove their motor coach back home to Virginia, they registered it in Prince William County, which does not charge personal property tax on R.V.s stored there, unlike Fairfax County, where they live.
And as of late last month, when The Times reviewed the records, they still listed Mr. Welters as the lien holder, notwithstanding the signed release he said he gave Justice Thomas in 2008 so he could obtain a new, clear title.
Mr. Welters said he could not explain why he was still listed as the holder of the lien. After he gave Justice Thomas the paperwork, he said, "I don't know what process the borrower should have followed." (To clear the title, the paperwork should have been brought to the D.M.V., where the lien release would have been recorded and a replacement title issued.) As for Justice Thomas, that was among the matters he declined to discuss with The Times.
'A Warm, Safe Place'
As details about Justice and Mrs. Thomas's subsidized trips to vacation homes and resorts have become public in recent months, his professed preference for traveling by motor coach has become something of a "yeah, right" punchline.
But by all accounts, he loves the anonymity, the freedom and the community it affords. He has hosted at least one event at the Supreme Court for a Marathon owners' club.
When he hits the road, he often goes unrecognized, which at times has allowed him to travel without a U.S. Marshals' security detail. Chris Weaver, who worked at Desert West Coach, said the justice had frequently gotten his motor coach serviced there before it closed. "Nine out of 10 times, he was just wearing sweats and a T-shirt," he said.
Traveling largely through red-state America has also meant that when he is recognized, more often than not it is by fans. Juan Williams, a Fox News commentator who has known Justice Thomas since the Reagan administration, said the motor coach was both the fulfillment of a boyish fantasy and a metaphorical "womb."
"He talked about the R.V. a lot," he said. "It was a warm, safe place where he didn't have to be attacked by liberals and Blacks on the left. What he liked about it was not being pilloried."
In a 2019 Q. and A. at the court, Justice Thomas said he had made it to nearly two dozen states, and declared himself the proud owner of a KOA campground discount card.
But the Thomases' road trips have hardly been limited to sleeping at campsites and Walmart parking lots.
In a 2009 call-in to a morning radio talk show, for instance, Mrs. Thomas said they were driving their motor coach through the Adirondacks, on their way to "meet some families from Texas." ProPublica has reported that the Thomases have spent part of nearly every summer for the past two decades in the Adirondacks as a guest of Mr. Crow, who owns a lakeside resort there with more than 25 fireplaces, three boathouses and a painting of the justice, his host and other guests smoking cigars.
When the Thomases aren't houseguests, they have stayed at upscale Marathon-endorsed destinations like the Mountain Falls Luxury Motorcoach Resort in Lake Toxaway, N.C.
There, the justice met Larry Fields, who owns a motor-coach-cleaning business. Mr. Fields said that for several days he had had no idea who Justice Thomas was, telling him he would have to wait in line to have his Prevost washed, which he patiently did.
"He was a great guy," Mr. Fields recalled. "I think we talked about how great Reagan was. He was low-key. It was just him and his wife and a dog."
Upkeep on a motor coach like the justice's is an expensive constant, and other friends have chipped in to help. While he did not disclose Mr. Welters's assistance in buying the motor coach, he did report that some former clerks got together and bought him deep-cycle batteries for $ 1,200 the year after he acquired it. He also reported that in 2002, Greg Werner, who ran a large, family-owned, Nebraska-based trucking company, gave him tires worth $ 1,200.
And over time, Justice Thomas made the motor coach his own. In a photo The Times obtained that appears to date back to the early 2000s, picturing his great-nephew as a child, the motor coach no longer sported the sizzling orange flames and Pegasus logo. Instead, it was painted in an elegant black-and-gold geometric pattern.
But if the custom coach changed, the justice's friendship with Mr. Welters endured.
While Mr. Welters was an executive at UnitedHealthcare, Justice Thomas twice recused himself from cases involving the company, in 2003 and 2005. As is the general custom of the court, he did not explain why.
In 2010, Justice Thomas traveled to the capital of Trinidad and Tobago, Port of Spain, at the invitation of the Welterses. By then, the couple had become major Democratic fund-raisers and President Obama had named Ms. Welters ambassador to the island nation. Local newspapers captured the justice and Mr. Welters talking to students at a school.
In disclosures, Justice Thomas wrote that the "U.S. Embassy Port of Spain" had paid for his flight. But flight records obtained through the plane-tracking services of MyRadar show that the Welterses' private Gulfstream G-6 flew from Washington Dulles International Airport and back on the days that Justice Thomas arrived on and departed the Caribbean island.
And Matthew Cassetta, a retired embassy official who helped arrange the visit, said Ms. Welters customarily "offered the plane to people who came down," always at her own expense to save the taxpayers money.
(Ms. Welters declined to comment on the flights or the loan, except to say, "I just want to tell you that friendships come and go, and that's what I want to say.")
The same year, in a speech accepting an award from the Horatio Alger Association, Justice Thomas singled out Mr. Welters as one of his "friends for the whole journey."
"And for Tony, a special thank you, who understood relationships and who was always there as a friend in the worst times of my life," he said. "It is a friendship I will treasure forever."

Over five decades, hip-hop has grown from a new art form to a culture-defining superpower. In their own words, 50 influential voices chronicle its evolution.
—
KOOL MOE DEE
The first time I remember being exposed to what we’re calling hip-hop now is Lovebug Starski on the mic at the Renaissance in New York, 138th and 7th Avenue. It was something I felt in my inner being. There was something going on inside me that said, I wanted to be a part of what that was.
Being a child of Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali, that whole revolutionary thought process was part of my DNA. I was pretty let down that the draft was done by the time I was 12, because I so looked forward to the day that I could be like Muhammad Ali. I was looking forward to not enlisting. So when I saw hip-hop, I had the same feeling: I’ll have a platform. That was my primary thought: I get the chance to do my Malcolm X thing on a mic one day. Hip-hop gave me the first inkling of that being possible.
Melle Mel was the first person that made me think that it was possible to take the lyrical content to where I wanted to take it. But Earth, Wind & Fire and Stevie Wonder gave me the inkling that you could actually put lyrics together and make an impact beyond just the music. “Songs in the Key of Life” was the most double-entendre, witty thought process, just in terms of the poetry in the title alone. And Maurice White — forget about it. When I heard the record “Fantasy” — “You will find/Other kind/That has been in search for you” — that was absolute peak metaphor for me. The fact that they were doing that kind of poetry on top of music was my actual genuine, genuine, genuine, genuine inspiration. I would say a calling, quite frankly.
I could not believe that Earth, Wind & Fire felt similar about me that I did about them. We were doing a cruise a couple years back, and they were rushing through the galleys to try to get to my show. When Verdine White broke down the difference in my cadence from the average MC? I was floating.
At one point, we were being belittled and looked down upon: That’s that bibbity-bop hip-hop stuff. But when Public Enemy and Chuck D got to be the center of attention, I was proud to say I was a rapper. “I do what they do.” Public Enemy took us beyond where most people thought we could take it. I make a little analogy that hip-hop has given Black America the chance to experience what white privilege feels like.
SCARFACE
I think my earliest memories were hearing the Sugarhill Gang’s “Rapper’s Delight” in 1979, and then the Soul Sonic Force, “Planet Rock.” I remember Kurtis Blow had a record called “Way Out West” — “Way out West from way back East/Coming from the place you’d expect the least/There came a stranger dressed in black/from a Harlem town a long way back/Had a Stetson hat with a band of gold.” I still remember it ’til this day. That’s the impact Kurtis Blow had on hip-hop.
I started going up to New York in my early teenage years, and started hearing and seeing the real elements of hip-hop, listening to WBLS on the radio. My cousin from uptown would send tapes to me, so I would always have the new hip-hop first.
In Houston, there was a hip-hop show called “Kidz Jamm” that came on 90.9. FM. There was also a local DJ by the name of Darryl Scott. That’s how we really got turned on to hip-hop. The first local artist I heard was Captain Jack. He was a DJ, and he made a record called “Jack It Up.”
I was a DJ first. My main influence was Jam Master Jay, the ultimate of all DJs. Then came the DJ that could rap: Grandmaster Dee from Whodini, right? I could rap, too, so I knew if I ever had to battle Grandmaster Dee I was going to douse his ass. That’s what I prepared my whole DJ career on: battling Grandmaster Dee.
I liked to cut Eric B. & Rakim’s “Eric B. Is President” and the Beastie Boys’ “Hold It Now, Hit It.” I was more the backspin, cut and spin DJ — I got into learning how to transform later. But as time went on I started moving more towards writing rhymes and producing.
The early Geto Boys made a song called “Car Freak,” and I thought they were famous, you know? But I didn’t know the realities of the music business until I got with Jukebox, Ready Red, Bushwick Bill and Willie D. Prince Johnny C had left the group, and when Jukebox left, it was just me, Will and Bill. That’s when we made “Grip It! On That Other Level.” Me and Willie did all the writing, we wrote for Bill.
I always tell people that I’m a hip-hop hybrid of Ice Cube, Chuck D and Big Daddy Kane. I wanted to be able to tell a story like Cube. I wanted to be very lyrical like Kane. And I wanted to have an in-your-face delivery like Chuck. As much respect as I have for Nas and Jay-Z, if it hadn’t been for that previous level of intensity in rhyming, I wouldn’t be me.
I’m just thankful that LL Cool J talked to my mom on the telephone during the New Music Seminar. This was when I first started rapping, a few months before “Mind Playing Tricks on Me.” This was the first time the Geto Boys got the chance to perform in New York, had to be around ’90. I don’t know what my mom and LL talked about, but I was on a pay phone with my mom and I was just so glad. And the Geto Boys got booed!
I think there were some artists booing us. Some of the other group members think it was probably A Tribe Called Quest. Nah, I’m just messing with you, because me and Q-Tip are cool as hell. That’s where we met, out in New York. And we toured together, too.
Q-Tip and I have formed a really dope friendship. He’ll just call and say, “Man, I’m just calling to tell you I love you, bro …” Well, I love you, too, Tip. That’s a very different matchup.
Being somebody that was born with this manic depressive mindset and just a sick disorder mentally, I found an outlet through my music. You saw me succeed. You saw me fail. I know that hip-hop saved me. But at the same time it took away from me being a good father, a good husband, a good son, a good uncle. The music stole me from everything that I should have been, but it still made me everything that I could have been, if that makes sense.
EVE
Hip-hop was always around me at a very young age. I had a big family that all lived together and my aunt loved LL Cool J — like, looooved . She always played his music around the house and went to every concert when he came to Philadelphia.
The neighborhood we lived in always had block parties with DJs in the summertime, ’84, ’85. Meredith Street — they’ve since torn them down, but we used to call it “down bottom,” 46th Street. You’re kind of in your own world when you live in the projects. Everybody knows everybody. So it’s a celebration of the summer and food and culture. But at the same time, it was not always the safest.
The music was full on Salt-N-Pepa, Queen Latifah, Fresh Prince — he wasn’t Will Smith then, he was just Fresh Prince. Along with tons of soul music. My biological father is a DJ, so there was music on that side as well.
A lot of the reason I went into hip-hop was the females. What I saw in them was women who were holding their own up against the boys, but still celebrating their femininity. MC Lyte’s “Cappucino” — I can totally remember the video. What was I, 10? I thought she was so damn fly. She had this long black coat on, but then her hair was stacked and shaved in the back. I wanted to get my hair cut like hers.
I always sang and I would write poems. But it wasn’t really until ABC came out — Another Bad Creation — when I was like, I want to start rapping. I formed a little girl’s group then — DGP, Dope Girl Posse — and we would do a lot of their songs, En Vogue, Color Me Badd. We did every talent show in Philly.
But I didn’t really start getting real serious until I got to high school, and I was very much a battle rapper. I was the girl who loved to get in a cypher. I started listening more to Lil’ Kim, Biggie, and my sound switched up. Philly is definitely different. We were known for being battle rappers, but a lot of Philly style is kind of more backpack and I just didn’t gravitate towards that.
It was fast and punchy, go-for-the-jugular. Because I used to battle rap against dudes all the time, I would just go at it and hurt their egos. It was basically just talking [expletive]. I always had stuff in the chamber. It’s very easy battling high school boys, ego-wise. It’s literally the truth: “You’re broke and you live with your mom.” Talk about their [expletive] size, and then you’re done.
It was always important for me just to be good — not good for a girl. I looked at those cyphers as honing my skills. I never turned one down. I went to Martin Luther King High School, and I’d cut and have like two or three lunches just to battle people. In the cafeteria, by the locker, the back stairs, whatever. On the weekends, South Street, there would just be cyphers on the corner. My full name was pretty much “Eve, That Girl With the Blonde Hair That Can Rap.”
Once I stepped in the studio I realized what a song was. We used to work with this one producer, Marv, who was really good at structure. I just wanted to do 24 bars and he was like, Bro, that’s not a song — you need a hook. We paid him when we could. Maybe bring him a bag of weed or something.
My first deal was with Dr. Dre. I auditioned for his A&R at the time, Mike Lynn. My managers were like, we’re going to put this beat on and you just rap. And I did. He literally called Dre right after I was finished, like, Yo, I think we found our girl.
When I was signed to Dre, one of his producers who I did my demo with was like, Yo, you have to meet this kid DMX. This was way before I knew what Ruff Ryders was. It just so happened we were under the same umbrella of Interscope. And after Dre dropped me, Jimmy Iovine said I’d be great with Ruff Ryders.
I just wasn’t happy waiting in the wings. I started getting on Dre’s nerves. They didn’t know the direction to put me in, but I’m very happy I got dropped, because once I got with Ruff Ryders, it was my boot camp. I thought I knew how to write a song — not really. I was told to slow down my flow. I needed to be humbled, and being dropped will do that. That being said, I went on to make some of my greatest records — the song I won a Grammy for [“Let Me Blow Ya Mind”] — with Dr. Dre. That was when I knew who I was, though.
I had a lot of opinions about how I thought I should sound. A lot of my ideas got shot down. The music industry was trying to put me in a box — the box inside the box inside the box. Luckily, I got to hang out with and look up to people like Missy Elliott and Trina and Lauryn Hill and Queen Latifah, who became a big blueprint for how I wanted my career to go, coming from hip-hop, but also being able to transcend.
I was a huge No Doubt fan — like, huuuge . I loved Gwen Stefani and nobody understood what I was saying when I wanted to do the song with her. People looked at me like I was crazy. But we’re the same in the sense that we’re girly girls who are also tomboys — the girl with the boys, because I was that. I knew she’d want to hang out with the girls because she’s always with boys. We just clicked.
Now I love Leikeli47, Doja Cat — she’s so freaking dope. Her lyrics are amazing. Coi Leray. Latto is lyrically great. I love Megan, Cardi, Nicki. I love the fact that there’s so many women that I can actually name. There were years when I would be like: Where . Are . The Women ? It’d be the one or the two. Finally, there is an actual landscape. I love it.
ICE CUBE
I knew a lot of slick-talking dudes that would rhyme all the time. Everybody had a little rap somewhere. I remember Teena Marie, Blondie — Muhammad Ali was rapping. It was just the cool thing to do.
But it wasn’t until songs like “Buffalo Gals,” “More Bounce to the Ounce,” “8th Wonder,” “La Di Da Di” — these are the songs that started to really get me turned on to rap. Blowfly had a song called “Rapp Dirty,” and when we were in fifth grade my friend and I would wait till his mama left and we would just play “Rapp Dirty” and Prince songs like “Head.” The adults would try to make you go to bed when it was time to listen to those records.
I loved KRS-One. He had a lot of different styles, a lot of different techniques. And he had one of the coldest names ever when you broke it down: Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone. He was an in-your-face rapper who came with style and intelligence. “Criminal Minded,” “The Blueprint” — masterpieces. He’s just one of the best that ever blessed the mic.
My first group, the Stereo Crew, had a song with Epic Records that didn’t hit. I don’t know if we sold five of them. We got dropped after that single. There were local groups we looked up to that were way bigger: Uncle Jamm’s Army, L.A. Dream Team, the Wreckin’ Cru, King Tee, Ice-T, of course. Toddy Tee and Mix Master Spade, Joe Cooley, Rodney-O. They were all starting to make noise.
Me, Sir Jinx and K-Dee, or Kid Disaster, we was going around joining rap contests and battles. We could never get into the talent shows because they didn’t want rap music back then. It was a hobby. There was a little money from playing shows, but nothing to think that you could not have a regular job.
I went to a trade school called Phoenix Institute of Technology, in Phoenix, Ariz., and got a certificate in architectural drafting. I already had a hit record at the time — N.W.A had “Dope Man” out. Dre kept saying, “You sure you want to go to school?”
I got entrenched into the hip-hop community in Phoenix at the time. Artists would come through and perform at a place called the Celebrity Theater — Fat Boys, Doug E. Fresh, EPMD. They knew I had a hit record out, so they would let me kick it backstage.
I was going back and forth every other weekend because Southwest had a great deal — $50 for a one-way ticket. When I graduated, in September ’88, we was in the middle of making Eazy’s “Eazy-Duz-It” album.
This was dirty, underground, hardcore rap. Explicit lyrics. We all thought we would have records in the Rudy Ray Moore section, next to the Richard Pryor records. Who would play this? Who would make this mainstream? We were being told that we were fools for spending our money to make records that couldn’t get played on the radio. It was just a ridiculous notion. But Eazy didn’t care — he felt like if a hundred people played it, that was good enough.
ICE SPICE
Middle school was a really important time, that’s when I realized that I was into hip-hop, specifically. All the mainstream artists, to be honest, that are GOAT-ed now. A lot of Drake, Nicki, Kendrick.
My dad rapped — he’s pretty private, so I wasn’t like, sitting there listening to his mixtapes. I would say he’s more like a freestyle type of rapper. It’s not like that was his whole life, but thinking back, that’s probably where it could have sparked for me, personally.
When drill started happening, I remember listening to a lot of Pop Smoke and Sheff G and Sleepy Hallow. I just enjoyed the overall feelings that the music gives, that summertime vibe. In my earphones, that’s what I was playing. Just listening to their beat selections and their choice of topics, I feel like that inspired me a lot.
I’m still growing and learning as an artist. I wouldn’t even say like, we’re fully here. Like we’ve arrived at my sound. It’s always changing and evolving. But I feel like in a couple years people will refer to this as my “Like..?” era.
My approach is really a reflection of my personality. That’s just how I am in real life. And I feel like I’ve always been influencing people, even before everything popped off, whether it was at school or whatever the case. But now it’s on a bigger scale, so it’s way better now. It’s musically, but also when it comes to how people wear their hair or how they wanna wear their makeup, how they wear their nails. Even with the lingo, certain things they say in songs, beat selection, cadence, personality. There’s so much to take inspo from.
But, you know, I feel like we’re all constantly influencing each other. I do the same thing in my own way. Like, I’ve taken inspo from so many different pieces of the world that I can only be flattered by it, you know what I’m saying? Like whenever I find myself almost feeling a certain way — like, Oh, why this person sound just like me or why they trying to look like me? — I have to remember like, that’s the whole point. That’s just how art works.
LADYBUG MECCA
I grew up in the DMV, and my friend had a lot of family in Brooklyn. So he would travel there and spend summers and he would record the Red Alert radio show on cassette. At that time in the DMV — this was like ’85, ’86 — go-go had more presence than hip-hop, so we were a select few that were even into it on that level. I became obsessed. It was just so fly and next level. I had already been writing my observations about the world down on like, little pieces of paper or napkins. So hearing people expressing themselves through words, through rhymes, through cadence, it just grabbed me, you know?
The Jungle Brothers really stands out for me in terms of those cassettes. Everything sonically, like the rhythms, the tone of their vocals, their wordplay. Musically, it was just a sound that I hadn’t really heard. It felt like the future, like complete freedom of expression, being like completely free in your skin. That’s the best way I can explain it.
I learned to rap by listening. I really loved MC Lyte. Queen Latifah’s “Wrath of My Madness” was mind-blowing, just out of this world. And Public Enemy, their rhythm spoke to my internal rhythm, you know what I mean? It was just like family, you know, I don’t know how else to explain it.
In high school, my other close friends had a hip-hop group and I started off dancing for them. And then I started writing and doing little shows, like local stuff. And it became very, very serious once, you know, Knowledge and Ishmael [Doodlebug and Butterfly] asked me to be in the group. That’s when it became a reality, like I could do this possibly for a living.
When we were out, we felt connected to the whole Native Tongues. Tribe, De La of course. Arrested Development. Gang Starr. I’m heavily influenced by Sweet Tee’s music. I looked to everyone, like Special Ed, Big Daddy Kane, all these people, they’re my inspiration. Daddy Kane was so smooth and cool, he was just everything. I couldn’t wait to get home to turn on the TV and watch music videos and just see what new I could absorb.
PROJECT PAT
My earliest memory is LL Cool J and some of the New York rappers. And of course, N.W.A and Ice Cube. But Scarface and the Geto Boys, man. Face is the one. I could visualize what he was saying. I hadn’t heard nobody tell a story about living down South. On one line Face was talking about how he was selling dope in the apartments, and that’s the stuff I was seeing in Memphis.
I grew up on DJ Squeeky — Squeeky used to have the club rocking. I listened to 8Ball & MJG. And anything Cash Money. Those are our guys, we was messing with them before they made it big. Paul and Juicy was on them before they even blew up.
When I made my first tape, I had a robbery charge pending. They were trying to give me 30 years, so I wasn’t thinking about no future in rap. But my brother and I could always make a word rhyme. I grew up around a lot of pimps on the street. I would ask them about their little pimp sayings. I would hear them saying it and I would flip it and turn it around in my raps. The pimps were my major influence.
Back in the days, New York didn’t accept rappers who weren’t from there. So I knew I made it when Funkmaster Flex dropped a bomb on my song. I was in New York one time and this is when “Sippin’ on Some Syrup” was rolling. Three 6 Mafia had sold something like 2 million copies of the whole album. So Flex dropped a bomb on “Sippin’ on Some Syrup,” right? And then he turned around and played “Chickenhead” and dropped a bomb on that one. I couldn’t believe it.
Then I did a show back in 2010 in New York, and the whole ASAP Rocky crew was there. I couldn’t believe it. And I was the headliner and the whole show was sold out. And when Cardi B made that “Bickenhead” song, man, that was a blessing. We love all the different artists that came after us — they keep us alive.
TRIPPIE REDD
My mom would listen to oldies, like, Tupac, Biggie, Jay-Z, Ja Rule, that soulful sound. And my dad listened to more like street underground from back in that era. People like Rich the Factor, Jadakiss, the Jacka and Ampichino, Fred the Godson. And then my uncle would listen to like more of the newer stuff, like Wayne and Drake and Thug. On my own time, when it came to YouTube, I would go listen to like rock, so like Kiss and the Red Jumpsuit Apparatus. I used to play Saints Row and they had a track on the game and it made me a fan.
My brother passed away when I was young, so that kind of gave me that drive to start wanting to make music. And I would sit at my grandma’s house and just rap on the stairs and be there for like two, three hours, just freestyling. We would have little things at school where we would have to write, so I would show my pen skills. I would make my school projects cool. Like, oh, I’m gonna write a letter to Drake. I literally did that too. I wrote a rap to Drake. I was in like seventh grade.
I started like experimenting with Auto-Tune and getting to my own sound. Auto-Tune and stuff like that, it got me into SoundCloud. That was like the beginning of like that super underground phase, Ugly God and Playboi Carti and Lil Uzi Vert, I started making music around the same time as them. But I didn’t blow up until the XXXTentacion and Juice WRLD era. I liked X and Lil Peep. If you go to my SoundCloud, it was really X, Lil Peep and then Uzi, too.
Lil Peep was on that sad boy [expletive]. That was hard. I love that. Just that feeling of, you know, depression and sadness and pain. That’s kind of where I was at the time, I felt like their movement is fire. Like they’re doing exactly what I envision myself doing.
I also listen to a lot of rock, though. I love Chino from Deftones. He’s passionately in character with his vocals. It’s like you gotta make certain movements and certain faces to hit certain notes. Sometimes he’ll just like go from like a melody to breathing and it sounds the same, like the melody and the breathing is all in one. It just sounds hard to me.
I’m not quite a rapper. I’m the odd man out. People mistake me for a rapper and then it’ll leave me in that box. So the way I could stay out of that box is by creating music that keeps me out of it.
CARDI B
An unforgettable moment as a child was when I saw Missy Elliott take off her head in the “One Minute Man” video, and that just made me like, go crazy for it. That’s all I wanted. It’s like, I don’t want to hear Barney anymore, you know what I’m saying? I don’t want to hear Disney movies music anymore. I just automatically got into hip-hop.
My female cousins that were older than me, they always listened to Lil’ Kim, Foxy, all the girls that was out at the moment. I always remember, my mom used to be like, “Don’t be playing that too much around the kids.” Then I got into Trina’s type of music. Trina makes like, you know, a nasty, freak nasty type of music. Lil’ Kim does freak nasty too, but I feel like they have different types of style. The route for me was more of a Trina route. It’s crazy because I’m a New Yorker, but I was always into that Trina and the Khia and the Jacki-O type of vibe.
As a teen, it just made me be like, yeah, “I wanna be [expletive] like them.” And that’s how I really am, actually. I started doing music when I was 23, but I was listening to these girls at 15, 16, 17, 18. So the personality that their music gave me stuck to me.
At the time, I just stopped stripping, so I was very much still in that whole stripper world. I wanted the music to be about me. My first song, “Washpoppin’,” it’s like, “I need all my moneymakers bring that cash out/I need all my D-boys to bring that cash out.” It was get money type of music. And then I also was making music for the gangsters because I felt like I was just such a gangster-ass little bitch.
My manager, he used to have long conversations with me like, how do you feel? I used to be like, oh, you know, I feel overwhelmed, sometimes I feel really tired. And then he would ask me weird questions like, so how do your boyfriend make you feel? How do you feel about love? How do you feel about your past relationships? And then I would have a conversation with him about my past relationships and my traumas. And then he’ll be like, oh, OK, so put that on your music. And that’s when I started to talk more about other things than just the things that I was doing in my past, like gang [expletive], street [expletive] and stripper [expletive].
TOO SHORT
I’ve been into the whole James Brown, Bootsy Collins, George Clinton, Parliament-Funkadelic thing since fourth or fifth grade. There were a lot of songs before “Rapper’s Delight” that had a little hip-hop vibe, but just didn’t have that name. It wasn’t called rapping. And you don’t even realize it until you go back and grow up a little more and listen back to songs of your childhood. James Brown is talking and, you know, telling you the breakdown’s coming — give me the horns . It’s just there.
I don’t even know if that was related to the New York streets in the ’70s or whatever, but I do know that words and rhythms were said over disco and funk records. But you know, once “Rapper’s Delight” hit, I think the DNA of hip-hop was planted in me. I would never not like that kind of music ever again.
I’m like, 13, pushing on 14. My father has a really nice stereo system set up in the living room. I’m talking like ’79, and if you’re what they called an audiophile, which he was, you really wanted to have your speaker set up for you to sit in a certain area and get a great musical experience. I got a little window between 3:30, 4, when I get home, and 5:30, 6, when he gets home from work. So those two hours, I could play it and just play it loud. “Rapper’s Delight” was the favorite, and there was another song that came out around that time, Parliament-Funkadelic’s “(Not Just) Knee Deep.” “Rapper’s Delight” is approaching like, 15 minutes on the 12-inch and “Knee Deep” is about the same. I would just play those two records back to back — you play them twice each and an hour’s gone by, you know?
Before there was any definitive identity in music-making for myself, it was purely based on anything George Clinton did. Any relation to Parliament-Funkadelic was the inspiration for how the music should go, how the drum pattern should go, how the bass line should go, how the breakdown should go. I always look at James Brown like, you know, the New York guys already got to that. They’re getting all the best samples and you’re too late on that train right there. But not a lot of people had gotten into the Parliament-Funkadelic and just recycled the funk.
The first rappers that had a profound effect on me were Spoonie Gee and Melle Mel. Spoonie Gee was just silky smooth with it — he was a player, one of the first players, if not the first, on the microphone — and he told stories of his day, just interacting with people and the ladies. He was just my favorite. These songs are coming out about these parties and kicking it and bragging — the early days, Sugar Hill Records. Then all of a sudden, here comes a guy who’s like, I’ve met this lady and I took her to my spot and I [expletive] her. And it’s like, he’s my guy .
And Melle Mel, “The Message,” it was just an amazing insight on New York life. I was already rapping when “The Message” came out, but there was no substance to what I was doing. It motivated me to start writing songs about my city. And that changed everything.
In my tapes, I’m using all the latest slang words. I’m naming popular people in the neighborhood. I’m talking about current events, whatever is, like, really ours. We talking 1982, ’83. “Rap is hot, but we got our kid right here. Too Short, he’s ours.” The entire east side of Oakland knew about us because we sold tapes in the streets. When we went into the streets and first started selling tapes, we only sold tapes to drug dealers. We had like a paper route of drug-selling spots.
I had all these little books that I would write rhymes in and my mom found them. I don’t know what she read. She never approached me and said anything. She just wrote this long letter saying, “I didn’t raise you like this. I hope you don’t believe in this stuff. Why are you doing this?” It was enough to make a brother want to cry.
You think James Brown’s mama would have been like, boy, stop gyrating and dancing? Or Little Richard’s mama? I don’t know. It’s the next generation. And my generation right now does not understand the look and the vibe that 16-year-old rappers are on. But you look at the video and it’s 300 million hits. Somebody gets it.
DMC
I was in seventh grade, 1978. We were all in the schoolyard and Billy Morris, who was in the eighth grade, he wasn’t like a thug or a gangster, but he knew all of them. We thought he was going to try to make us smoke cigarettes and drink Night Train or Thunderbird, that 99-cent liquor. When we got over there, he had this tape recorder and said, “Check this out.” He pushed play and a beat came on and we heard this voice say, “When you keep the pep in your step you don’t stop ’til you get on the mountaintop/And when you reach the top, you reach the peak, that’s when you’ll hear Eddie Cheba speak.” That was the first time I heard hip-hop on tape.
Billy let me hold that tape for a weekend. He saw how bad I wanted it. I listened to it from Friday night all the way up to Sunday night at 10 o’clock. My moms was like, “Boy, you better get your butt in bed. You got school in the morning!”
Summer vacation comes, and now I’m seeing hip-hop at the park parties and the block parties. All that was probably going on all this time but it wasn’t until the tape that I paid attention to it. By having that tape with me for the weekend it became part of me. Now I’m open for that vibration. This was in Queens. I didn’t know anything about the Bronx. I couldn’t even leave the block!
My brother, who is three years older than me, comes home talking about getting a turntable because his friends were all getting turntables. So long story short, we didn’t sell weed. My brother and I were broke. All I had was this huge Marvel comic book collection. So my brother says, “Yo, we ain’t got no money, but D, you got a lot of comic books. We are going to do a comic books sale so we can buy some turntables and a microphone.”
Me and my brother buy the turntables. Every time he would leave, I would go to the basement and try to figure them out. It wasn’t until I heard Grandmaster Flash that I really got interested in DJing. In Queens we called them Flash tapes. These were live performances that were going on in the Bronx, Harlem and Manhattan that were coming into Queens via cassette tapes being sold like records in every hood. Flash tapes, DJ Hollywood tapes, Zulu Nation tapes were all going around Queens.
Everybody is playing that “Rapper’s Delight” song. And the only thing I really paid attention to on that song was that Superman rhyme. It was so different from all the other raps. Because I was a good student, I listened to “Rapper’s Delight” three times and learned it from start to end.
My brother brings home a record called “Superappin’” by Grandmaster Flash, the guy from the tape who had these Furious Five MCs. It changed my life because it came on with so much power. “It was a party night everybody was breaking/The highs were screamin’ and the bass was shakin’/And it won’t be long ’til everybody knowin’ that Flash was on the beat box!” It was so different from “Rapper’s Delight.” It resonated with my youthful rebellious nature. That was the day Darryl McDaniels became Easy D.
I think because I was into comic books I understood the alter ego thing. Melvin Glover is Melle Mel. Mohandas Dewese is Kool Moe Dee. They had these alter egos so I knew I could play into that.
The ones that made me want to get on the mic, of course it was Melle Mel and Kool Moe Dee. But the artists that changed my life was DJ Charlie Chase, DJ Tony Tone, and the Cold Crush Four who were Grandmaster Caz, JDL, Easy A.D. and the Almighty Kay Gee. They are the greatest group in hip-hop that a lot of people don’t know about. They kept it raw on the MC performance thing. I changed my name to DMC because of GMC, Grandmaster Caz.
“Rapper’s Delight” and “The Breaks” were cool. But the greatest period in hip-hop is the time before recorded rap. It was a live tape of the Fantastic Five vs. the Cold Crush Four at Harlem World that changed what I thought about rapping. They was playing Billy Squier’s “Big Beat,” they were taking Spoonie Gee’s “Love Rap,” and they were making routines out of them! They were flipping everything that had been done and taking it to another level. That made me say, wow, you can be a rock star with this. The attitude they had reminded me of AC/DC or Iron Maiden mixed in with George Clinton, Parliament-Funkadelic and James Brown.
For me, I took real vocal inspiration from Freddie Mercury, Robert Plant and Mick Jagger. Especially Mick because Freddie was usually very melodic. He could do opera, but Mick was different, raw. I’m the king of rock. I didn’t want to be the king of rap. All I cared about was comic books. Black music was in my house, but I saw it as my mother’s and father’s music back then. It was 30-, 40- and 50-year-olds. They are listening to all this great Black music by people like Aretha and James Brown. I didn’t get it as a kid, but with ’70s rock radio there was a station in New York City called 770 WABC. Harry Harrison and Dan Ingram, they would play James Brown, Marvin Gaye, Al Green and Aretha Franklin. But they also played Harry Chapin, Bob Dylan, Led Zeppelin, the Stones and Joni Mitchell.
So the reason why I love rock more is not only the voices were stronger, louder and powerful and they looked like superheroes, the drums and the guitars were stronger and louder. It was like the Incredible Hulk to me. So the confidence that I had was like, “OK, I may not be as eloquent in words as Moe Dee and the rest of the Treacherous Three. But if I rock this mic like I’m a member of the Rolling Stones or Led Zeppelin? If I bring that persona to hip-hop?” Man … it worked. Chuck D said it: Run-DMC showed hip-hop could be done on rock star levels. That’s why I said, “I’m the king of rock/there is none higher!”
CAMRON
I started watching, paying attention when I was 8, 9 years old. I’ll be here forever telling you a bunch of names, but people that I loved was KRS-One. Kool G Rap, Slick Rick, 3rd Bass, EPMD, A Tribe Called Quest, N.W.A, Gang Starr, De La Soul, Queen Latifah, Naughty by Nature. I remember going to the Gap trying to get polka dot shirts because Kwamé had a polka dot shirt.
To me it was neck and neck between the conscious and the street rap, then all of a sudden the gangster just took over. Maybe because what was going on outside of rap with the drugs and crime. Maybe that elevated gangster music more than regular music.
My aunt lives in Inglewood, so I used to go to California in the summers and hear the radio and they wasn’t playing what we was playing. And then I went to Navarro College in Corsicana, Texas, in ’94. And I remember getting to school and it was like a culture shock almost, ’cause it was no New York music being played. All they played was Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. Also these guys that I wasn’t aware of that had a big influence on the South, UGK. I loved it. With UGK, I think Bun B can rap with anybody, any state. I think Pimp C was more a lifestyle thing. Bun and Pimp, they mesh beautifully.
When I came home from Christmas break that year, “Shook Ones” was out and I was like, yeah, New York! I went back to school with “Shook Ones” on a cassette tape and I kept playing that every day. That had me in the New York mentality and I end up pistol-whipping somebody and getting kicked out of school.
So with me being from New York, I learned a balance. I don’t want to act like I’m not a lyricist, but then at the same time it may be too much for people. I probably have more male listeners, but I always keep in the back in my mind, I want some girls coming to my show, too. This one of my top three rappers, but I’ve never heard any girl be like, yo, throw that Kool G Rap on.
I remember when I was on the verge of getting a deal. I was at this girl house and Jay-Z was just coming out. He didn’t have an album yet. His first few singles was out. I’m like, yo, Nas is nice, man. She like, nah, I like Jay-Z. She said, Cam, I don’t want to carry a dictionary to the club with me when I go out.
That Nas and Jay-Z argument, it wasn’t just with the girl. I seen it starting to happen in different conversations and I was like, Jay is kind of the new standard. Before we had phones, when I didn’t have a deal, I used to keep 100 different loose-leaf papers in my pocket. I was like, whenever Jay-Z come out with something, I gotta come out with something because I seen where it was going and how people started adapting to him.
There wasn’t anybody that we said we need to be like them or rap like them. What I did see was that movements were always accepted. Whether it was the Native Tongues, the Hit Squad, or whether it was Cash Money or No Limit, or Roc-A-Fella or Murder Inc. I was like, I could create a team to where if you don’t like Cam, you may like Juelz. If you don’t like Juelz or Cam, you may like Jim Jones. ’Cause we used to be on my block arguing about who was the best in No Limit and people used to be like, oh, y’all don’t even know about Mr. Serv-On. And I would pay attention to these arguments and I’d be like, yo, everybody likes No Limit, but they have their favorites. So as long as you like No Limit, it don’t even really matter, ’cause you like the brand.
I remember Master P arguing with a DJ in New York. I won’t say the name. And they was trying to say, yo man, if you come to New York, we could give you this, this and this, ’cause Master P never had been in New York. And Master P, I remember him telling the DJ, look man, I don’t need New York. I don’t need y’all. I’m good. And I was like, yo, [expletive] is really eating outside of New York. So I already knew it’s an audience for that, so I always kept that in my mind.
Years later, Pimp C called me one day and he said, “Hey man, I’m about to dis the whole East Coast except for y’all. Them [expletive] up there be fronting. I believe y’all raps, man. I was at ’106 & Park,’ I seen Juelz. He had a Maserati, that thing was cute. Everybody else, they ain’t getting no money like us down here. But I think y’all are.’”
LL COOL J
It really started with the tapes that were floating around the city. The Cold Crush and the Fantastic Romantic 5 and the Force MCs and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Four, and then Five MCs. And then later on it was Fearless Four and the Treacherous Three. And Zulu Nation.
I lived between Long Island and Queens, but I actually got exposed more on Long Island because next door to me was a whole house full of foster kids, and they were from the five boroughs, but mainly the Bronx and Uptown. They were bringing tapes, some better quality than others, so I was hearing everything way earlier. I was hearing it as it was unfolding.
One day I was in the hallway in junior high, I had already been rhyming for quite a while, and this kid was singing part of a Jimmy Spicer song: “This DJ, he gets down, mixing records while they go ’round.” The light was coming through the hall and it was just me and him, he didn’t know I was there. I just remember the way he looked when he was singing that. And the way it sounded — it just clicked for me. I said, That’s what I want to do for real. I actually want to step into that dimension. It was like a dream.
From there I just started joining a lot of groups. Some rejected me. At the end of the day, I just worked really, really hard. I went everywhere. I was all over the city. I was all over Queens. I started going uptown to Harlem. At about maybe 15, 16, right before I actually ended up recording, I started hanging out with a guy named Silver Fox. Silver Fox was like a tutor for me when it came to the craft of writing rhymes and cadences and lyrics and all that. He also mentored Kool G Rap in a different way. Fox was real skillful, and he was a very prolific songwriter.
Lyrically, I was inspired by Melle Mel, Spoonie Gee, the Treacherous Three, the Fearless Four — DLB, Tito, Mighty Mike C, Peso. Those were the guys that really were into wordplay. A lot of their wordplay still holds up very well. They all had unbelievable style, and I was able to learn a lot from them. It’s kind of like I would imagine a guitar player sitting down and listening to how people roll them licks and hit them chords, and then after a while you just kind of develop your own thing.
One thing led to another. I was just sending tapes out and finally, obviously, my tape got in the hands of Rick Rubin in his dorm and Adam Horovitz of the Beastie Boys. By the time I got to “I Need a Beat,” I was ready to rhyme on any stage, in any arena, with anybody.
I did run into a little bit of arrogance here and there, which is why I’ve always tried my best not to treat anybody the way some of these guys treated me. It was a very small community, though. No industry. In other words, there were no managers. Russell Simmons ended up managing people, but he was still learning his way. There was no network of people. It was just a few believers here and there. I’m a generation 1.5 artist — myself, Run-DMC, Beastie Boys. Meaning that we tapped into the culture, evolved with the culture, but then we are the ones who went out and actually turned it into a full-blown, worldwide global industry.
BOOTS RILEY
When I was 15, I was trying to get my boy Johnny to come to police brutality rallies. I was like, man, you can rap and it’s gonna be a lot of people there. And he would be like, I’m only gonna do it if you rap, too.
Often what I was doing was just stealing Schoolly D stuff because nobody knew it. In school, pounding on the table and rapping, I was also doing theater. Somebody came up with the idea like, let’s do our own version of “West Side Story,” but we’re at East Oakland, so let’s call it “East Side Story” and let’s make it all rap. So that was my first writing.
I spoke at a rally at U.C. Berkeley, and this dude Pizo the Beat Fixer who was Too Short’s DJ for a while comes up to me and says, “Hey man, do you rap, ’cause that political [expletive] could hit right now.” I was like, yeah, matter of fact, I do. He put out an album that was me, Spice 1 and a dude named Mocedes who was known at the time because he was on Tony! Toni! Toné! song where he says, “Mocedes, the mellow.” Later on, he got known as Mopreme, Tupac’s stepbrother.
Here’s the thing with every local artist, even to this day — we’re all taught that we aren’t [expletive]. I remember I was in junior high when Too Short got to open up on the Fresh Fest. And people were talking about, oh, how they let him on, blah, blah, blah, this and that. It wasn’t until MC Hammer and Digital Underground where people started being like, oh, you know, this is something local but other people like it. You have this little town mentality. And so when we had the Coup, it took until we could show that people other places liked us to where people claim you. Because everybody wants to be connected to something important.
I mean, there was definitely a sense of teamwork happening, people sharing contacts, people wanting shows to happen. I do have to say this for the 20-year-olds that are reading, you’re not like, reposting each other’s things. You show up at each other’s thing. You’re in each other’s videos. E-40’s uncle was distributing most everybody’s stuff. At one point, my manager was Chaz Hayes, and he was managing us, Spice 1, E-40, Master P and some of the members of Tony! Toni! Toné!
“Soul Beat” on TV was the way that you also heard about stuff. They had stuff like Ice Cube when he was just in C.I.A., dancing by the pool. So the Coup and E-40 and the Click were performing at Soul Beat Day, and backstage E-40 and Studio Ton was like, “Hey, we want to do something with that lyric of yours ‘practice looking hard.’” So that’s when we started doing stuff together. We were doing a lot of car shows, lowrider shows up and down California. I still have my trophies from doing those lowrider shows.
I remember Wild Pitch said to us, we got this idea. They were like, you don’t really fit into a genre, and we think one way to get past that is to put you on a college tour. And we’re like, we’re not making no college music. Meanwhile that’s who’s buying the records, so we made a terrible mistake.
But they gave us $14,000. So we went on a 50-day tour in a minivan where we got out in each city, we put up our own posters, put up our own stickers, asked people where the record stores were and went to the record store, played them our record, made ’em listen to it.
When we got to D.C., the label was like, we’re not getting any headway with BET. We had saved up our per diem, you know, we each had $5 a day. We knocked on the door, we told Joe Clair to pick wherever he wants to go to eat. We took him to eat and hung out with him and showed him the video. And then a week later, I think it was Memorial Day, they played it crazy. Right then we were in Cleveland and people started being like, I just saw you on TV.
EARL SWEATSHIRT
My best friend when I was like 4 or 5 years old, literally in a hip-hop movie-style fashion, came over to my house with a Rob Base tape. The only thing that makes that unique is that it happened in 2001 and not in 1988. It must have been his parents’.
By the way, a lot of people’s favorite flows from their faves right now is basic party-rocking flows from the ’80s. The ’80s is back. Like BabyTron — Detroit got the ’80s really right here in our face right now.
Before I went to Samoa, I was listening to Lupe, Hov, De La, Common, P, Dilla. Dilla as a rapper, I’m not gonna do the whole annoying thing right now, but that was a huge thing. Like, I spent a lot of time as a 12-year-old really locking in flow-wise. I’m always gonna fly the flag for the Cool Kids. I feel like Cool Kids and De La, if you squint, it’s a similar space. Now that De La is back on streaming, bro, I’ve been on it heavy. Rappers still can’t rap like that. Like, it’s too free, but structured. It has that impossibleness to it.
By the time of my first tape, I didn’t even have enough time to synthesize all of my influences. You know how Peter Parker first gets bit by the spider and his web is all over the place, he’s gotta get the suit? It was that. I’m finally at the point where I can even hold all of this at once, or be dexterous enough to move within all of it.
But when I was like 15, on my first tape, I was listening to Eminem and Doom. Which is where everyone checks in with me at — everyone’s like, OK, Doom-Eminem guy. Everyone is mad because I don’t say, like, “hazardous” when I rap anymore. [Expletive] is really excited by just one-for-one-ing four-syllable words. It’s a good party rap trick. But that’s easy, you know what I mean?
A thing that has kept me healthy is never being xenophobic about the Brits. I’ve been listening to British rappers the whole time. I think you dust yourself if you don’t. They are really, really, really, really, really good at rapping. They got the freedom of like some dancehall, bro. A lot of where it will be hanging off the cliff’s edge of a beat. That’s what I love about them though — you can go to a new place if you let yourself go over there. It’s like jazz standards, bro. If you don’t have a valid U.K. flow, then you’re gonna get dusted.
Growing up, I feel like we were the first generation that was familiar with everything but, like, maybe don’t want to listen to it all day. But we’re finally at this point that I used to joke about like five years ago, where little kids don’t know Tupac and that’s not embarrassing. It’s supported.
Every generation of 19-, 20-year-olds is gonna come along and be like, [expletive] what you guys just did, I don’t care about it. Maybe that’s like a natural kind of thing that happens as you stand up as a human being. But learning how to listen to Nas, learning how to listen to these things that even though you want to listen to Lil Wayne all day, your older brother, your uncles are like, this is it right here — that’s important.
And I’m still down for that. From my own experience with committing these passages of song to my memory, I know the utility of being a historian so you can draw lines from that to the new thing and not be lost. And then most importantly not become jaded and not have a in-house fighting thing going on that’s yielded some pretty nasty [expletive].
I was part of that first generation that came on the internet and was like, [expletive] this [expletive]. And then old heads were like, what is y’all little [expletive] talking about? And then having that butting-heads thing unnecessarily, because we gotta work together, you feel me? It’s like being in a house. If the adults only interacted with the adults and the children only interacted with the children, it doesn’t work.
You gotta be around kids. This is what I’m saying about the utility of the multigenerational aspect of this thing. The elders know what happened so they can inform the younger ones on, oh, if you like this, then you should check out this, this and this, so you can see the iterations that came before and you can do something different. And then the young people are here to teach the old people this new dance move.
If there’s one thing that comes through this article, I hope it’s this. I want to clarify for people that’s inspired by what I do. I feel like because of my disposition, the thing that I see some kids take away is like a mood and a vocal timbre. And it’s like, I went to the Samoa boys school, my whole [expletive] was all [expletive] up. Whatever weirdness everyone watched me go through was legitimately genuine for me. That is not a stylistic choice. I wish that I didn’t sound like that.
I hope that what they take away from me is be good at rapping. That’s the thing that I care about. I really don’t [expletive] with being a tortured artist. Being tortured is not tight. Rapping hella good is tight. Pigeonholing me means you can just feign knowledge by being like, oh, he makes sad music. Bro, if you listen to my music, 70% of my music is about being better than you. I am a very competitive rapper.
I feel like I had the world put in my hands and I was like, what the [expletive] is this right here? And so I don’t want you to copy that part. I’m saying if you ever get the world in your hands, be free.
Q-TIP
My sister was best friends with Sweet Tee — she made that record, “It’s My Beat.” So back when I was little-little, I remember hearing them talk about records, like, you heard that Treacherous Three record? I’m like, Treacherous Three, I’m thinking it’s like superheroes.
There was a record store on Linden Boulevard, like, right up from my house — I forget the name of it. I used to go there with no money and just ask him about the records and just to see the records. And he would play them for me. You had hundreds and hundreds of 12-inches that would just start popping up. Back then it was still coming out of the disco culture — “Rapper’s Delight,” Fatback Band, “King Tim III (Personality Jock),” Ronnie Gee, “Raptivity.”
We heard “Rapper’s Delight,” and I’ll never forget Phife calling me like, yo, we can do that! The newness of it left us wide-eyed and inspired and hopeful.
You think about the Treacherous Three, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, the Fearless Four, everybody had a group. So you have all these vocalists trading off. And if you even wanna get geekier about it, it goes back to like the old doo-wop street-corner harmony. Famously Run-DMC obviously took that whole interplay between them two and made it worldwide. And of course we wanted to be like them.
I was a big fan of LL Cool J, Kool Moe Dee, T La Rock, L.A. Sunshine from Treacherous Three. All of the dudes where the vocabulary was just a little extra. Slick Rick was huge — his sound, his tone, his voice and the confidence, you know?
Obviously coming up with the Jungle Brothers and De La Soul and the whole Native Tongues, we were tuned to be a little bit more cerebral. And all of the aforementioned icons got us to that point where we knew that we could cannonball off of the diving board. But I remember us wanting to even go further, to be like some Earth, Wind & Fire or some Parliament-Funkadelic. Like to really try to turn it on its ear, and just let that flag fly.
Our thing was to try to marry the two, the music and the content of the lyrics. And to try to be differentiators even amongst our caper partners. And to our left and to our right, when you would look, there’s N.W.A doing that same thing. The music that Dre was putting with the subject matter fit so perfectly. It was fresh, it was just new and it was exciting to be able to emotionalize the music.
Dre and I speak all the time. That’s my bro. We actually have great musical volleys. Obviously LL. I still speak to the De La guys, of course. I catch Latifah here and there. A good deal of us still keep up. I still speak to Lauryn. It may not be like a full open faucet stream of conversation all the time, but we still keep up. I remember talking to Snoop years ago and he was like, man, when y’all made that “Back in the days in the boulevard,” me and Warren G used to rap y’all [expletive].
I think it was 1991, we were doing a Midwest and South gauntlet with the Geto Boys. We were opening for them — they were huge down there. Probably the two most unlikely groups, right? But we had so much fun, man. We was big fans of them, we was rapping they [expletive] to them and they was rapping our [expletive] back to us. It was just amazing. I remember very early on we had a show with DJ Quik and KRS in Compton, and just seeing all the Bloods, and they was just rocking to “El Segundo” and “Bonita” and it was just like, wow, this is really a unifying music.
Because of the scarcity then, when you got in, you had to be good. To be good was the average. I think that everybody’s grind back then to get on was something that created conduits of empathy amongst us all. So that when we did see each other, we were able to tell each other griot tales of how we all got on. “Y’all too? Even in Houston? Even in Cali? Even in Miami?”
When you’re doing it, you feel like you’re on your own planet, right? But then when people dig it and you start seeing other people draw inspiration from what we did, it let us know that we were onto something and it also made the world a little less scary, if that makes sense.
It’s just a great moment of, for me personally, humility and appreciation, when you see a Digable Planets or Arrested Development, a Pharcyde or Souls of Mischief, the Roots. You could go to Badu, the Fugees. And Dilla, who was the great extender of the parlance and endowed it with his own beautiful traits.
That’s to me what I take a great sense of pride in, that I can see all of these guys go on and do honestly better than what we did and to lay even more tracks for us. And it’s like, “Come on, let’s go.”
50 CENT
I fell in love with hip-hop, but it was only playing for one hour out the week on the radio. My grandmother used to go to church and take a tape recorder and record everything the minister said, and she would play Sunday service to herself again on like, Wednesday. She had all of these Maxell cassette tapes that once you record, you break the little tab off. I had to go get toilet paper and put it in the square and record over what she already had for the church. It was only on for one hour — I had to record it then.
This is back when KRS was out, he made such an impression on my career early on, ’cause creatively, that aggression that was there. I didn’t follow a complete blueprint of what he’d done, and at one point he got so much smarter than the audience that it wasn’t entertaining because it was like learning some [expletive]. It was teaching. That’s where he lost me a little bit. But when he came in the beginning, he had the competitive energy — that was what hip-hop was to me the entire time.
He said, “Manhattan keeps on making it, Brooklyn keeps on taking it/Bronx keeps creating it and Queens keeps on faking it.” And I’m from Queens! I liked it so much. But I didn’t know how I felt about it because of what it said.
If you look at that, then look at what I done at the desperation point where Columbia didn’t understand who I was as an artist. I was approaching the release date and I had to do something. I know I don’t have the momentum or anything. It’s going to not work, and it not working isn’t an option. So “How to Rob” — that’s my version of that energy.
Biggie and Tupac, following that, artists were afraid to say each other’s names. So Nas was saying “20 G bets I’m winning ’em, threats I’m sending ’em/Lex with TV sets the minimum.” It was him describing Jay-Z. “In My Lifetime.” Subliminally talking about each other without actually mentioning each other’s name.
My personality difference from the other artists, I’ve been bumped around more than them the entire journey. On my journey early on, it was rough. Then as the music business was doing it to me too, I kind of didn’t know how to not respond like the pit bull that you have outside in the yard.
Early on, Dre was like, I know what this is, this is N.W.A, it’s just one member. What Dre was telling me was that I don’t have to reach to get the audience to come [expletive] with me. They’ll come to me. But I was like, I need this other thing. I had worked out and I got myself into a good space physically. I needed the female audience to feel like they could fix me.
When I listened to great albums, they’ve had emotional moments. With Biggie, it’s “____ You Tonight” featuring R. Kelly. It would create a tone shift on a rapper’s album more like rapping as the feature on someone else’s R&B song. Like Dre specifically, that record, “21 Questions,” he was like, I don’t know why you want it. I hear it. It’s good, but you don’t need it.
The hardest person you could have a melody on a record was Nate Dogg. Nate Dogg will [expletive] you up! Having Nate was the coolest way to make a record like that still feel really hard, and for you not to question it.
I was creatively in pocket on the first record. But I became a star during the second album. The second album is when I found this new value for myself. I started feeling like a bad bitch.
I’ll tell you something that Michael Jackson taught me. Because he was talking to Chris Tucker, and he was a big fan of the actual music. And he was like, you know what, he has good melodies. Like, the way I would say things in the choruses and stuff like that. And that’s what is allowing it to connect internationally, where English is people’s second language. They only can follow the melody.
I think in general, the culture loves things that are damaged, because it makes the audience feel better about themselves, looking at somebody like, they’re more [expletive] up than I am. It allows parts of the audience to go on a safari. To be close enough to the animals and not actually be in danger.
GUCCI MANE
I remember buying my first $5 cassette tape, 2 Live Crew, from the flea market in Alabama. I was like 6 or 7. I didn’t even know what the music was about, that cover was just so raunchy to me. My mama found the tape and played it on the porch in front of her friends to embarrass me — like, “Look what Radric’s listening to.” But I only bought it for the cover.
I moved to Atlanta when I was 9. My brother was listening to the gritty underground Atlanta stuff, the gritty Memphis stuff, New Orleans, so that’s what I gravitated towards — Kingpin Skinny Pimp, Triple Six Mafia, the Hot Boys and Master P.
By the time I started trying to finance my own first tape, maybe ’99 or 2000, those were the key people I could relate to — B.G., Project Pat. Like, OK, this dude just got out of jail, and everybody in the hood listens to that. I’m going through the same things at the same time.
I didn’t feel like Project Pat was the best rapper, but he made me feel him. I’m like, can’t be Fabolous or Lil Wayne, but I can do this. I was late in the game, but I didn’t have to be scared to try. I was going to spring break in Daytona, and it was the whole summer of Project Pat and Big Tymers. I started doing the stuff they were rapping about — like, I’m going to be the CD that I’m listening to.
That’s really how this started. It wasn’t even a love of hip-hop; I’m a hustler. I’m like, damn, I really don’t want to sell dope all the time. It’s too risky. If Jermaine Dupri can put out Kris Kross, Birdman ain’t really a good rapper and I got a little money — I can get in this.
I was always thinking, none of this matters if I go to the club and I ain’t got no movement. I’d seen rappers try to get their music out, but they looked lame and no one took them seriously. I was like, “How can I get the whole apartments on Bouldercrest to come with me?” I knew I was popular, I was already going to the club, and I leveraged that. It really was calculated.
My first album came out in 2005. I think 50 Cent dropped his in 2003. He was just super hot. The same stuff he was talking about, I was really having those beefs. It ain’t even nothing to glorify, but that’s what was going on for me, for real. That was my soundtrack, and it really emboldened me to talk with urgency about the stuff I’m doing.
That was at a time when I was heavily in the streets, and I was heavily paranoid about what I had did. I was riding back and forth to Alabama trapping and I had two CDs — Lil Jon’s CD, “Kings of Crunk,” and “Get Rich or Die Tryin’.” That was my inspiration: “I just have to get past this stage.” I moved fully back to Atlanta in 2004, and maybe two weeks later, I made “Black Tee.”
Gucci in ’06, I just was whoever I was 24/7, a lot of times to my detriment. But that’s who I was as a 26-year-old guy trying to be an artist, one foot in and one foot out. My peak came later because I was locked up. But the business was in a better place when I got out, and I benefited from that.
People would never think that a rapper in his 40s would be as in demand. But I’m making way more money than I thought. I never could travel until I was 37, 38 years old. I’m glad I don’t have to do a show in the hood all the time, like I was doing. I know the chitlin circuit. I’m so glad I got over a lot of hurdles, where now I can do a show internationally and get the type of money I felt like I deserved.
Being in Iceland was definitely one of those moments. I had a concert at a festival. The sun didn’t even go down the whole day. That was the craziest thing I’ve ever seen — and it was fun. I never would have thought that it would be something I’d like. I used to tell people, “I don’t want to go nowhere but East Atlanta and right back to the studio.” But damn, it was way better than sitting in that cell.
DJ HOLLYWOOD
The beginnings of what hip-hop is was called non-syncopated rap, meaning that they had a lot of rap, but people weren’t doing it to the track. They had a jazz beat going or some kind of miscellaneous beat that didn’t drive the words. Whatever they were talking about, it had to be really, really tight and interesting, or nobody wouldn’t listen to it. So some of these cats was like the Last Poets, Rudy Ray Moore, Blowfly, Jocko Henderson, Pigmeat Markham, Oscar Brown Jr., Hank Spann. A turntable wasn’t involved.
When the turntable became involved is basically where I step in and started adding the lyrics to a record. I got my first job in ’71. Once I got the mixer with the headphones, it changed the game.
Records back in the day, there was an A section, a B section and a break. I’m the voice. And then I get my voice out right in time for the guy that starts singing. As long as I’m complementing the music, I’m in it. Not only did you get the great record, but you got the great introduction to the record as it came on, you know?
I was a singer before this all happened. I began to sing everything I said — “If I was snow, I would be cold/If I was a jug of wine, I would be old” — and that’s what made it harmonious.
I didn’t call it rapping. I was just entertaining. It was new, it was fresh. A lot of people was like, “Yo, could somebody tell this [expletive] to shut up. Let the record play!” I went through the wire with this. It wasn’t all sweet. But I managed to stand my ground.
After the blackout in ’77, everybody and they mama had some equipment — microphones and turntables and stuff — and they all started to get into the game. I had the blueprint of what a person should be doing, and mostly everybody, they were sounding just like me. A lot of the guys were using my same lines to get their thing on, you know what I mean?
I’m the creator of the style. I’m the creator of the colorful words over music to make people enjoy themselves. Because the first raps was about enjoying yourself. Then it got political and then it got to your neighborhood, then it got to the stickup man and then it got to the sexy, all that came after. But at the beginning, it was basically just to have a good time.
I saw people putting out records, but what they’re doing is slightly different. But I had a big head. Like, get out the way — this is Hollywood!
I was high. I was a lunatic for a while. When you high, you don’t give a [expletive] about nothing. And that’s how I got left behind. ’Cause I was fired up and then being fired up inside my head, like there’s nothing better than me. I’m not ashamed. That’s what happened and that’s how it went.
I was high for a long time. I was high in the ’80s, too. I was on cocaine at first and then I moved to the crack. I can’t blame what happened on anybody other than me. Don’t have a soul in the world that I can say, man, y’all didn’t do me right, y’all didn’t look out for me. And I know plenty of people that could have, plenty of people that should have.
I didn’t make the money that they’re making now, but at the time I was making more money than anybody. I had limousines, I had my own Cadillac. I was doing very well, but I was getting high at the same time, so I was spending my money frivolously.
Everything that I ever owned, it just went. I lost the apartment, so all the stuff that I accumulated there is gone. And I did that over and over and over.
The whole 50 years of hip-hop that they’re promoting right now, it’s not about dudes from where I’m at. It’s for dudes from the ’80s. I look around, man, there’s 7,000 legends. Where’d they come from? How? What did you do to be a legend? This little period of 50 years of hip-hop and they’re honoring it, if it goes past and I get nothing out of it, then I don’t know what to do from there.
I can’t beat myself up. I got clean toward the ’90s. All I want to do is find me a spot where they let me play. I’m trying to see right now how I can change my life from here. The whining, I ain’t never do that. Me cracking myself over the head, I’m not going to do that. I’m sorry I didn’t catch on, but I mean, it wasn’t no thing to me. I really didn’t have that period where I was so sad that it wasn’t me. Because I’m in all of them. I’m in their DNA.
MC LYTE
In Spanish Harlem, where my grandmother lived, my older cousins were playing cassette tapes: the Cold Crush Brothers, Funky 4 + 1, Sha-Rock, Treacherous Three, Sugarhill Gang, Kurtis Blow. I remember one of my cousins used to date his brother, and that was a big deal.
The Sequence was definitely an influence to hear — Angie B, Blondy and Cheryl, how they all attack, like very differently from one another, but were laid back with it. That laid-back way became a part of the way that I stepped to a microphone. And of course, Salt-N-Pepa, they definitely were a guiding force for me. I learned all of the words to their records as I began to practice for who it is that I was going to become.
Run-DMC, Melle Mel — the message of “The Message” really helped me. I was already writing stories, because my mother insisted I write essays for everything. So to be able to hear about this place that I had never been. I had never been to the Bronx. I was just Brooklyn and Manhattan. As far as I knew, 138th Street was the last stop on the train.
I never considered myself a rapper. I was an MC, and an MC, to me, is very different from a rapper. Like an MC is, you know, Nas, versus someone who is not an MC, but had a rap record, and that would be Hammer. He wasn’t in there to show his skills off as an MC, he was in there to make a hit song. Just because you rap doesn’t make you a rapper. But that’s just me.
I happen to like a lot of what the female MCs are doing now, and I listen to everything — I’m a DJ. I’m not just an ’80s, ’90s DJ. I like “Plan B” by Megan Thee Stallion. I like Megan’s register. I’m a fan of Remy Ma. The way that she rhymes, she makes you feel it, just like Lil’ Kim. Just like Foxy. Foxy, Lil’ Kim and myself, we’re all from Brooklyn.
I like this new one by Coi Leray, where she uses that “Message” sample. I like Latto when she used Mariah’s sample. It just feels like a return to something heavy and loaded, and I like when I can feel the depth in someone’s voice.
I’m a fan of Rapsody. I love what she talks about. Just the awareness and acknowledgment of love and womanhood and Blackness. Tierra Whack. Nobody’s messing with that freestyle, she’s just bananas with it. And of course, Cardi and Nicki. Baby Tate. It’s like so many MCs on the scene. Lady London. Oh my goodness, she brings it. You’re talking about college-educated, and not afraid to flip some words on you that you got to go look up.
No one rolled over and started rapping by themselves. Everybody was inspired by somebody. Whether they want to come clean about that or not is a different situation.
LIL WAYNE
The New Orleans hip-hop scene was way more captivating than the worldwide hip-hop scene, because it was more in your face. Our local radio stations, they favored our artists, so our Top 10 songs would always be full of New Orleans. You’d probably get a Billboard No. 1 hip-hop song thrown in there at, like, No. 8.
Our block parties were a bit different; they were more like a concert. There’s a big crowd, there’s a DJ and there’s a microphone, but it’s not for the DJ. The DJ would introduce the artist coming on, and it was up to that artist to keep the party going.
All these names are a chain link to me getting a deal: This first artist, his name was Roni. Roni was one of the best. He reminded me of Juvenile a lot. His niche was finding a way to tell you exactly what he’s doing every day — walking to the damn corner store — and he found a way to make you love it, feel like you could relate to it, like you just took that same walk. He’d go through his day and people would love it.
You could get a recorded tape of that whole block party, sold after it was over. I would only want to hear Roni’s part, backwards and forwards, over and over and over. He was from my hood, but he was a grown-ass man, so he didn’t know too much about me.
From the other side of my hood, there was another guy named Lil Slim and he was a bit different. He talked about the hood, and the hood only. I meshed those two guys together, and I couldn’t wait to get my opportunity.
I was every bit of 9, 8 years old. Thank God I was always a smart kid in school, so I was interested in words, always interested in words. Never knew why; I still don’t. I always was the main person in the play. Whatever it was, from “Les Miserables” to “Wizard of Oz.” I want the main role. I couldn’t wait till the day that damn DJ gave me the mic. It was over.
I was probably around 10, 11 when they had the station called the Box. People were ordering videos, so you had to watch 1,000 videos you don’t want to watch, but once or twice you’ll see something on there that you didn’t know too much about. That was my real introduction to being actually interested in other music other than New Orleans music.
I fell in love with New York artists, anybody from the East Coast. They was making more of their words to me. You had people like Q-Tip and Busta, way before the “Gimme Some More” swag — just a backpack, big old jacket on, spitting. I was interested in artists that took on a character. The reason why I don’t read comic books or watch cartoons or believe in superheroes like my other friends was because I’m getting the same thrill out of hip-hop.
I fell in love with Onyx, because I believed they woke up in the morning screaming at each other. And still my favorite artist, Missy Elliott. You know when you’re watching a sport and you’re like, this person is just too cold, too damn good and they can do whatever they want? She was that person to me.
Before there was Drake and people who were rapping and singing, Missy was doing that. That captivated me, and I was moved by that. It made me want to do it. That’s why I loved Drake when I met Drake. If you’re around me, you know for a fact that if you’ve got a little harmony, a little melody in your voice, I’m about to make you sing.
To me, Shawn Carter, Jay-Z, was the god of words. He could’ve rewritten English books. I was introduced to Jay by listening to Biggie. “Lucky Me,” from “In My Lifetime, Vol. 1,” I learned backward and forward. I put it in songs, and I actually start off every show, still, saying words from that song: “And I swear to everything when I leave this earth/it’s gon’ be on both feet, never knees in the dirt/you could try me, [expletive]/but when I squeeze it hurts/fine …” And what’s crazy is we stop the music on that part and the crowd sings the rest of it with me as if I wrote that. But that’s all Jay.
When it comes to B.G., he’s very significant, very specific, because we put songs together -together. That was back when I actually put words on paper. I know exactly his writing style, his technique. It’s impossible for some of that not to rub off on you. But I don’t write anymore.
I was probably about 16, 17 — this is before internet and all that — when I heard a nugget that Jay wasn’t writing. And I didn’t want to ever see a pen or paper again in my life. Jay was my Bible.
Back then, whoever the star was, they would always take on this young protégé. I would always look to that person. When Jay did it, I would look to Bleek. If I’m listening to Puff, I would look to Mase, or I would look for Jada. It was the humility of the big dog to set up a path for the next person to be bigger. And so that’s why I made sure when I got the chance, I was going to run with it.
Nicki Minaj was always into my wording technique, the way I come up with the verse. “Why?” “But why?” “OK, but why?” She’s that kid. She was set on, “I’m the female Weezy.” Nick would change her voice like me, she would actually sound like me sometimes.
Drizzy’s just Drizzy. That “good boy, bad boy, I was on the TV show, but I wish you would play with me” type of stuff.
I was scared, actually, when I called Eminem for a song. That is a monster. He must have the same thing I have with words. Like, we can’t get them out of our heads. Every meaning, every aspect of them. Things that rhyme, we hear it. I already know the gift and the curse that he has. And I love to hear the way he puts it together.
When I was on “The Tonight Show,” I was playing Pictionary. And my thing was Harry Potter. So I drew a pot, and they got that. I drew a man with a face, and I put a bunch of hair around him. They were like, “Wait, he’s hairy.” I’m, like, Harry Potter . We plan our words. At all times.
AZEALIA BANKS
I’ve made a special contribution to hip-hop, and I feel like that gets overlooked a lot of times. Hip-hop is Black culture. People say, “Oh, you make house music, aka white people music.” I’m like, honey, no. House music is Black music. Everything I do is in the spirit of hip-hop.
My first memory of hip-hop, even though I had no clue what was going on, was O.D.B. on Mariah Carey’s “Fantasy” remix. I was like 2, going on 3. And Lil’ Kim’s verse on “All About the Benjamins.” The audacity was just so fab. I remember the video with the fisheye lens, the see-through dress and the blonde wig. And she started off with: “What the bloodclaat?/Wanna bumble with the bee, huh?/Throw a hex on the whole family.” I didn’t know what a hex was until I was maybe 16, but I could spit that [expletive] word for word.
I was a theater kid, and Lil Wayne, for sure, was like a thespian. It was theatrical and the jokes were funny . “Cannon” is probably one of the best Lil Wayne verses ever. [Raps “Cannon” for 30 seconds]
But my favorite rapper of all time is Styles P, from hearing the Lox at block parties. Then we had the DatPiff era, so I would download like, “Ghost in the Machine.” I just like how unrehearsed he is. And the swag. He was talking to you rather than trying to create a fantastical world.
We actually have a song together on my first mixtape. He did it for free. I’ve done collabs with other male rappers that will probably never see the light of day because I wouldn’t sign their record deal. Like, damn, Yeezy — I loved you my entire life and that’s what you do?
I started rapping because I had this boyfriend who rapped and they would do these cyphers. If your bars were wack, they would, like, snatch the blunt from you, you know? I skipped the cypher for like two weeks and I came back with a vengeance. I had to learn all these different words for “firearm.” I wrote “Seventeen” over that Ladytron beat and when they passed me the blunt that day, I came out with: “I’m not the don diva/I’m beyond ya don skeezers/I get cake from quick chicks with long heaters.” They was like, “Ohhhhhh. Shorty, you can rap! You should record that!”
The very first record that I ever recorded was into a microphone in a sock in this guy’s closet, in between all these Supreme jackets. Two weeks later, I was featured on the Fader blog. I blew up overnight and then it was just kind of like, OK, I have a job to do now.
I think that all of that theatrical training definitely helped. When it came to “212,” that white girl Valley Girl voice, I was really just making fun of dumb bitches who come to New York for like two years and are like, I’m a New Yorker !
I think that everyone at XL Recordings forgot that I was 17. I felt like there was no mentorship. Everybody just kind of abandoned me and expected me to know what they wanted.
At the same time, they had just signed Odd Future, who were super, super duper crass. I won’t lie — I was so jealous just watching them put all this love into Odd Future. Just to see them be given the support to be kids. It’s a classic tale of boys can do whatever they want, but girls need to be like, prim and proper. I sent “212” in to XL and they dropped me. It was 100% a bunch of misogynoir.
I was thinking maybe I should go get a GED and go to college. Then I just get this phone call from Nick Grimshaw on BBC Radio 1, and he’s played it like a million times. I didn’t even know what BBC Radio 1 was. And then very quickly you go from getting paid $150 and a bottle of Smirnoff to perform to getting like, 5,000 euros at some weird charity event. I’d never had 5,000 anything all at once in my hands, ever. All I could think was, I’m going to get a weave and a laptop.
One thing leads to another, and then I’m at Karl Lagerfeld’s house. I didn’t even know who Karl Lagerfeld was when he invited me to perform at his house in Paris. I didn’t know what Coachella was when I got booked for Coachella. That Coachella date in 2012, it was like, all right, I’m here. I’m a star.
Jimmy Iovine, the very first day I met him, he said to me, “The best thing you can do for a woman is get the [expletive] out of her way.” He actually bought me my first, like, three pairs of Louboutins, my first Chanel bag, my first real bottle of perfume. He was always a gentleman and he always thought my jokes were funny.
“212” was such an anomaly that no one has been able to successfully build upon it outside of me. What I see is people doing an Azealia Banks impression, and that is partially due to just the belief that a woman couldn’t be the mastermind behind the sound, the aesthetic, the everything. I’m still alive, girls.
There’s no magic in hip-hop now. Hip-hop has been taken from us and used as a weapon against us. No one is talking about anything. Just for the record: All these little new rap girls — they really suck.
LIL B
In 2003, I wrote a book report in middle school that was about hip-hop. That’s as real as it gets, man. From a middle-school me: “Hip-hop to me is an art form, a style, a genre, an influence and a lifestyle. It’s a different type of music style that does not sound like any other type of music. It’s like a baggy, nice, shiny type of clothing.”
I’m walking the beach right now, and I’ve also got an article that I tore out of XXL magazine in 2005, about when Lil Wayne performed at Club Speed, Dec. 19, 2004. It’s hilarious because you’re talking about 500-plus attendees. Now obviously Wayne can do stadiums. That’s my early motivation. Ain’t it crazy later I made the XXL freshmen list? These papers I’ve saved have been through fires. It’s very, very personal to me.
Gucci Mane, Lil Wayne, you know, they set the bar. They set the bar still to this day. It was so much inspiration out here in the Bay, too, from E-40, Too Short, Mistah F.A.B., Turf Talk, Keak da Sneak, listening to 106 [KMEL], listening to Wild 94.9. I feel like I really seen it from a unique perspective.
You’ve got to realize, there was a time where I was the only one doing what I was doing. I was outside at a time when people were saying music was dead, and I was still pushing. It hurt my heart when Nas said hip-hop was dead, and I made it my mission to make sure hip-hop stayed alive. This was before the iPhone.
Just hearing my mom and my dad say they’re proud of me, knowing they have seen me do my thing independently, unsigned. It’s 40, Short, Master P and myself, Brandon McCartney. We did the Jive Records thing with the Pack. I’ve been doing my own thing ever since. I’ve been managing Lil B.
Soulja Boy is a real legend and an inspiration, a pioneer with the music, early on YouTube. He was really at the anime store back then, you know what I’m saying? He don’t get no credit for that. It’s a lot of hype around anime now, but he was going to the store early.
I always looked at myself as giving out swag. I say that humbly. There’s people that have the fire that I see. I appreciate Lil Yachty — he was always holding it down and then taking his career to a whole ’nother level, showing me what’s possible, doing Sprite deals. Future, Tyler, the Creator. Chief Keef — I was changing the game with the music video stuff on YouTube and then he took it the next level. Now I could be influenced off Playboi Carti, you know what I’m saying? And Young Thug took it to the next level.
I’ve still got a lot of homework to do with this hip-hop, right? I need to do my homework on De La Soul. I need to do my homework on Slum Village. I’ve got to really do my Public Enemy homework, you know? What’s the gentleman’s name — MC Serch and his group? A little bit of Beastie Boys homework. It’s so many beautiful people that’s added to this genre and to the culture.
E-40
I call myself the greatest game-spitter of all time. A game-spitter is somebody that spit that slang, the street [expletive], all angles. I might touch down on a pimp. I might touch down on being over the stove, twisting the pot counterclockwise, serving the dope wet. I might talk about when a guy about to get jacked, or about to pull a lick, or when he’s going to get his head tore off, you know? It was whole ’nother angle of the game that the Bay Area was on back then.
I was the first rapper talking about zippers — calling ounces “zippers,” that’s 28 grams. I was the first one calling them “units.” I was the first rapper screaming “choppers” — it came from Chicago, from Al Capone. I could document all that. Everybody’s saying “slaps” — I brought that to the rap game. It came from me, Earl Stevens, E-40, hands down.
So many things didn’t come out of my brain; it came from the streets. When rappers are from the urban community, they talk about their surroundings and what they done picked up here and there — in the pen, wherever they at. That’s me.
In Oakland in the ’80s, the local D-boy would have enough gouda to shoot Too Short some money — it could’ve been $500, it could’ve been a thou-wow — to make a song just about them. Calvin T and Magic Mike, from Richmond, Calif., they were doing the same thing. These are local songs circulating through dubbed tapes. They were a big influence on me.
And Ice-T. He was speaking a language that most of us was living. People don’t give him enough credit. We have a mutual love and respect for each other because game recognize game. He seen my whole hustle in the underground, selling tapes out the trunk of a car.
I was a rapper that invested in myself. We was doing this when Moby Dick was a goldfish. A&Rs didn’t get what we was talking about. A lot of times it would go over their head like a flying saucer, you know what I’m saying? That’s just the same as out there with 8Ball & MJG, Master P. Everybody was doing it independently. When we did independent music we did it by force, not by choice. I signed my distribution deal with Jive Records in 1994. The whole Bay Area followed my blueprint after that.
When I came out with “Ghetto Report Card,” I was 37, 38 years old. My whole career was just revived. It was amazing. I was part of the crunk movement and the hyphy movement at the same time. “U and Dat,” “Snap Yo Fingers” and so on. We had the South and the West Coast.
Imagine if there was streaming back then when we had “Tell Me When to Go,” “Bitch,” “Choices.” We would be diamond on each one of those records. I put new life into the West Coast in 2006. And that’s no ifs, ands or buts. Can’t nobody say I didn’t, with the help of Lil Jon. And it’s never stopped since then.
That’s my role — they call me the Ambassador of the Bay. And I don’t know nobody else there that represents it like me.
EMINEM
My Uncle Ronnie had the “Breakin’” soundtrack. I was, like, 11 years old, and he played me Ice-T’s “Reckless” before I’d seen the movie. Uncle Ronnie used to breakdance and he taught me a little bit, showing me some moves. From that moment I knew there was nothing else — no other kind of music that I would ever like again — aside from rap.
We used to bounce back and forth from Missouri, and shortly after that we moved to Detroit, and we were staying at my Grandma Nan’s house. I had a tape player, and I found WJLB. There was this DJ named the Wizard. He would play from, like, 10 to 11. I would just hit record on my tape and I’d go to sleep and get up for school to see what I got: “Go See the Doctor,” Kool Moe Dee, UTFO. I just wanted everything — give me everything that rap has: Run-DMC, Fat Boys, LL.
Every time LL dropped something it was, like, he was the best, no one’s touching him. LL Cool J was everything to everybody. You know, I always wanted a Kangol.
My first rap, I was 12-ish, when LL Cool J, “Bad,” came out. I would be, like, just walking around my Aunt Edna’s house, thinking of rhymes and writing thoughts down. It was a complete LL bite, but it was something that I dabbled in. I would be sitting in school sometimes and a line would hit me.
And then Run-DMC would drop a new album and you’d be, like, “This is the craziest [expletive] I’ve ever heard.” “Yo, this is as good as rap can get, lyrically.” And then Rakim changed the way people thought about rap.
It just kept advancing to the next level. I was there to watch its conception and its growth. Everybody was trying to one-up each other. It went from rhyming one- or two-syllable words to rhyming four and five and six. Then Kool G Rap came along and he would rhyme seven, eight, nine, 10.
But I was a sponge. I would gravitate towards the compound-syllable rhyming, like the Juice Crew. Lord Finesse, to Kool G Rap, to Big Daddy Kane, to Masta Ace, Redman, Special Ed. I don’t even think I understood why I liked it. I had a couple of friends that had to point out to me how many syllables somebody was rhyming.
And then Treach from Naughty by Nature came along and he was doing all that, too. He was cool, too — his image and everything. I wanted to be him. When the first Naughty by Nature album dropped, that whole summer, I couldn’t write a rap. “I’ll never be that good; I should just quit.” I was so depressed, but that’s all I played for that summer. Proof thought Treach was the best rapper, too. Every time he would drop an album I would just be, like, Son of a bitch.
Nas, too. I remember The Source gave “Illmatic” five mics. I already knew I liked Nas from “Live at the Barbeque” with Main Source, because his verse on that is one of the most classic verses in hip-hop of all time. But I was, like, “Five mics, though? Let me see what this is.”
And when I put it on, “And be prosperous/though we live dangerous/Cops could just arrest me/Blamin’ us/We’re held like hostages.” He was going in and outside of the rhyme scheme, internal rhymes. That album had me in a slump, too. I know the album front to back.
There was three or four years, maybe, where I kind of dipped out of listening to rap. I was so on the grind in the underground. I didn’t have money to buy any tapes. Every dollar, every dime that I had went to either studio time or to buy Hailie diapers.
Tuesday night I would go to the Ebony Showcase on Seven Mile. Wednesday night would be Alvin’s. Friday night would be Saint Andrew’s. And then Saturday would be the Hip Hop Shop.
Proof was hosting open mics at the Hip Hop Shop, and they started having battles. The first one that I got in — it was actually the first battle there — I won. And then the second battle, I won it again. I realized maybe I should try to go out of state. So I would hop in the car with friends and drive down to Cincinnati for the Scribble Jam.
Back then, you had to go off the top of the head. If you didn’t you’d get booed offstage. So I learned from watching Proof that you can freestyle, but just have a couple lines in the back of your head, a couple of punchlines you know you want to use, and then freestyle around that.
Coming up in the battle scene was the greatest thing to happen to me because I knew what lines were going to get a reaction from the crowd. That’s what I would focus on. So when I got signed with Dre, I was trying to translate that to record, to get that reaction. I would picture the listener sitting there and what lines they might react to. I just used that as a formula. Like, “How you gonna breastfeed, Mom?/You ain’t got no tits.”
When the first Onyx album dropped, Sticky Fingaz was so great at saying that kind of [expletive]: “I’m thinking about taking my own life/I might as well, except they might not sell weed in hell.” And Bizarre was really great at that. If we reacted to it, then we thought other people would, too. That shaped my whole career, you know?
BUN B
When I was young, I was immersing myself in the music, but I don’t actually want to become an MC until “Microphone Fiend.” And this is after I fall in love with the Juice Crew — Kool G Rap, Big Daddy Kane became huge influences on me. I’m writing rhymes at this time. The “Microphone Fiend” video comes on “Rap City,” and that’s when I decide I really want to be a rapper, ’cause this is the coolest [expletive] I’ve ever seen in my life, and I really want to be seen as this cool.
You don’t really start hearing Houston hip-hop until KTSU starts playing it. That’s the radio station for Texas Southern University. There were guys like R.P. Cola, Billy Dee, these were the guys that were actually in the clubs having freestyle battles. Around that same time as Akshen, but that’s still very under the radar. “Another Head Put to Rest,” that’s not playing on the radio. It’s too much cursing. You hear “Car Freak” and stuff like that, but it really doesn’t come together until the Geto Boys “Balls and My Word.” That’s when the idea of making music and putting it out was not as far-fetched as it seemed.
I start writing about ’88. Juice Crew, Rakim, that’s the technical level at which I’m aspiring to operate. The use of metaphors, manipulating the English language, rhyming mid-word, putting together as many similar-sounding words as possible. And I feel like I should be pretty good at it because I’m pretty good at school, right? I make really good grades in English. I know more words than most of my friends. I should be able to figure out how to incorporate some of that into rhymes. I tried it initially, it was terrible. Like [expletive] would’ve had to literally sit down and get a dictionary. And people don’t really want to do that.
A lot of this realization is Pimp’s influence on me. He was like, man, this [expletive] gotta jam. People gotta be able to see theyself when they see you and hear theyself when they hear you. If you want to be good on a technical level and compare your rhymes to rocket ships and cellular biology or molecular biology or whatever, that’s cool. But at the end of the day, people gotta dance to that [expletive].
When we first started putting out music, I say there might have been 50 rappers in all of Houston at the time. But when we first went to New York in ’92 to sign with Jive, the first three white people we met in New York were rappers. Like the bellman: “So what are you guys doing here? You rap? Oh man, I’m a rapper!” Pizza guy: “You’re here to sign a record deal? Put me on, I’m a rapper.” The driver the next day: “You guys rap, I guess? You’re going to the Jive building. I do a little something-something.” And all of these guys white! The weed guy was like, “You guys are rappers? I rap too.” And he was white as well.
In the earliest years of my career, I wanted to try to vocalize how hard I felt I was and how tough I felt I was. I eventually realized it was not about being the hardest, it was really about being just hard enough and being able to be enough of what was needed in that room at that time.
So if I’m in a room with a bunch of Ruthless Records [expletive], there’s a certain way I gotta move and carry myself, but eventually when I get to the mic, everybody understands who we are. Same thing would happen if I would’ve ended up in a room with Q-Tip and Busta in ’92. There’s certain assumptions that people are gonna draw about each other. And when I actually show my talent, that’s the unifying point.
I was fascinated by wordplay and that was the dominant style of music coming from the East Coast. But then I’m also from a very small town. There’s a lot of gangster [expletive] going on in my town. Crack is coming into the city. And so I know that if I rap, I also have to be a reflection of that.
At one point I hear this song, Volume 10’s “Pistolgrip-Pump,” which sonically sounds nothing like us, much less anything at the time. The beat was dope. Then I hit the hook and I’m like, wait a minute, that’s me. It’s from one of my lines in “Pocket Full of Stones.” I never asked for a dime. I didn’t think that rappers charged other rappers. When I heard it, I was more like, damn, they know my [expletive] on the West Coast! And then he gets on another record and is like, “‘Pistolgrip’ was a hit!/UGK, I’d like to say what’s up.” I’m like, this is crazy!
We met Biggie in ’94. We’re on promo with Jive Records, and this is literally within three to five days of Craig Mack’s “Flava in Ya Ear” going gold. So we’re there, Craig’s there, Big’s there, and everybody’s really fawning over Craig Mack. But obviously we wanted to meet Biggie.
We go over and we introduce ourselves and he’s like, “I know who y’all are. Y’all are on the ‘Menace’ soundtrack. Y’all got the ‘Pockets’ joint — I was out there with Eiht, I told him y’all got the best record on the soundtrack.”
We were very flattered and taken aback at that. And keep in mind, this is when we’re in possession of the bootleg from Biggie, but I’m trying not to allude to that. I don’t know how he might receive it.
We had weed, we offered to smoke with him. So we go out to the car to smoke and I offer him the front seat and he’s like, nah, I’m gonna sit in the back if that’s OK. And he never closes the door on the car. I’m trying to hotbox, right? I’m trying to get the doors closed, get the windows up, but he’s not going for it. And come to find out, ’cause he didn’t really know us like that, he didn’t want to sit in the front seat ’cause he didn’t want dudes he didn’t know behind him. And he needed the door open because he would need a little bit of a head start if he needed to make a quick getaway.
KOOL KEITH
I was a popular dancer in high school and I saw rap from the B-boy stance when rap was being plugged up into the streetlights. When I was going to school, the Cold Crush Brothers were going to school with me. It wasn’t until the mid-80s that I started rapping, which turned into Ultramagnetic MCs.
I met Ced Gee when we were going to high school together and we formed the group. We listened to the Treacherous Three, who would use a lot of big words in their raps. They were using words nobody was using. We looked at the Treacherous Three like, This is the point of hip-hop. I want to rhyme like this. I don’t want to do the “Yes, yes y’all, ya don’t stop the body rock!” They put pen to paper. Now rap was about vocabulary. It was no longer baby rhymes.
T La Rock was one of the most high-tech rappers at that time with the technical words. I was hanging with Greg Nice. We had a chance to see everybody from the super old-school acts all the way up to Spoonie Gee, Run-DMC and Whodini. They were all out with records before we even had a deal.
At the time there was a craze happening where everyone was using TV-show themes. So we waited for that craze to go by and that’s when rap started going heavy with the samples. It became MC Shan, Eric B. & Rakim and then Ultra. So when “Ego Trippin’” came out, that was like the third record that shocked everybody like, Wow, this is different!
We pressed up 500 copies of “Ego Trippin’.” We hit Red Alert off, and I delivered the records straight to Marley Marl’s house. I remember Big Daddy Kane was in the kitchen. That’s where Marley had his mic set up.
Marley was really open to it. He spun it on WBLS. And then I gave Chuck Chillout a copy in person. I remember me and Funkmaster Flex used to talk in his car about different rappers.
To be honest, a lot of rappers were jealous of Ultramagnetic MCs, but when “Ego Trippin’” came out, there was nothing you could do because every car had it playing up and down the block. You would hear it in every project. All you would hear is “MC’s Ultra! MC’s Ultra!” everywhere you went. I would go through the projects and people would scream and we didn’t even have a video out. I wasn’t popular on TV. I don’t know how people had a vision of knowing a person without even seeing them on social media, on Instagram. Back then it was more about the flyers and posters and people seeing you on a show with Boogie Down Productions.
If you listen to the second verse of “Ego Trippin’,” I was just making the words fit on a beat. I wasn’t trying to rhyme: “Through the scientific matter I probe for evidence/Leading melodies obtaining slight positive beams/Of the average formulation, apply mechanically.” And people didn’t even know what I was doing because the first verse of the record was more straight rap. The beat was so hot and the chorus was so dramatic that you didn’t even realize the second verse didn’t rhyme.
At that time, I liked Lakim Shabazz. I liked Latee’s “This Cut’s Got Flavor” and stuff like that. But once we were out, I tried not to follow rap in a lyrical way because I thought that if I listened to everybody’s rhymes a lot, I wouldn’t have my own originality. I used to buy funk records like Con Funk Shun because I was a dancer. I bought Undisputed Truth and Cameo. My main inspiration was Slave. That’s why Ultra’s music was like that. I didn’t grow up on jazz. I didn’t know about Ron Carter or Ronnie Laws.
When I started the Dr. Octagon project, I had so much material piled up that I had to break it up into different characters. People thought I was just being weird, but I was being a businessman. A lot of artists were stuck as just one person. They had to do a record deal with that same style again. But I had a lot of ideas. I think that’s why Parliament-Funkadelic opened my mind up. They had Brides of Funkenstein, they had Sir Nose, Funkadelic and Parliament. George Clinton broke his group up into so many different parts. So that’s what I felt like: a one-person Parliament-Funkadelic.
During that time, I tended to like the peculiar people. I liked the artists that had flows, like Fiend and Mac from No Limit. But a lot of the rappers couldn’t adapt to different sounds. That made me feel like, OK, I’m going to create a Dr. Octagon. I’m going to create a Dr. Dooom. I’m going to create a Black Elvis. But all of those characters are part of me.
KRAYZIE BONE
My first memory of hip-hop was when my older brother brought home the LL Cool J “Radio” tape. I remember him coming in the house and he threw the tape on the bed and was like, “You don’t know nothing about this.” And I put the tape into the radio and I never took it out. Never took it out, you know what I’m saying? I was like 12, 13. That’s what made me start writing my own raps, because I wanted to learn LL Cool J’s songs. I loved “You’ll Rock.” I still bump that to this day. The beat was hard, the lyrical flow — LL was before his time on that.
So I started writing down his lyrics and I saw the blueprint on how to write a rhyme. I wrote my own one day and I never stopped. All the songs I liked that I wanted to learn, I would write the lyrics down. I liked the continuous flow, like Big Daddy Kane and Biz Markie, Dana Dane and Slick Rick. We never liked when rappers would flow and they would pause and then they would go back.
The Bone Thugs style developed by just basically being in cyphers together. We would smoke weed either in my mother’s basement or at whoever’s house we was at, and we’d just start rhyming, working on our harmonies and everything. We knew each other and we knew we could rhyme but when the other four would say the ad-libs, it would sound like we was harmonizing. It’s nothing we did on purpose — we just started doing it and that was our style one day. We didn’t even know what we had until we would rap for people and they’d be like, “Y’all sound like the rapping Temptations or something.” Then when we got with Eazy-E, he would tell us, “This style is different. Y’all singing like singers, too.”
Before hip-hop, I was a Michael Jackson fanatic. I was a New Edition fanatic. R&B, that’s all my parents played. So I know about all the old-school R&B like the Isley Brothers. We just started mixing in some of those flows. If you listen to “1st of tha Month” and “Days of Our Livez,” we just started picking old-school songs and putting our harmonies to it.
Singers liked what we were doing. When our management got a call about Mariah Carey wanting to do a record with us, at the time, we didn’t even really understand how big Mariah Carey was. We knew of her, but we were so wrapped up in our newfound fame, we were just in our own little world. So, like, we almost didn’t even go. We was on the plane contemplating, about to get off the plane, but something just made us stay on the plane.
When we got there, she said basically she loved our style. She loved our flow, how different it was. I’m glad we didn’t get off the plane.
We also got love from Bobby Womack when he was alive. I got a chance to meet his daughters and they told me, “Yo, my father loved y’all music. He played y’all music all the time. He turned us on to y’all.” That really shocked me. I was like, Wow, the O.G. It made me feel good because I came up loving his music. It was cool to tell my parents, like, “Hey, guess who listens to Bone? Bobby Womack.” My pops was like, “What?!’” He loved that.
FABO
We came up off Michael Jackson, my mama listening to James Brown, my grandpa was really into Curtis Mayfield, my uncle listening to Run-DMC, New Edition. We were singers — I came up in the era where you were still going out there trying to sing to the girl to catch her, you know?
My very first memory of hip-hop was sitting down with my brother, rewinding Bone Thugs-n-Harmony trying to learn “1st of tha Month”: “Wake up, wake up, wake up.” That was when it really hit me, like, this is what I want to do.
I’m from Bankhead, so I seen Kilo, the dope boy in the neighborhood who had made it, in his money-green Cadillac all the time. And I came in the rap game up under Raheem the Dream. These was our local heroes. They mean everything. That was our inspiration, but the world didn’t know them like that.
I was freestyling, winning the local talent show every week. And I started singing this song called “If You’re Down on Your Luck Say (Ow),” and everybody started singing it.
In the apartments, it was me and Young Dro. We ended up sparring against each other all the time, freestyling. This guy takes us down to Raheem the Dream. The rest is history.
When we left Raheem, I went to Shawty Lo. I’m in high school, and I was playing the tenor drums at the time. He was taking care of us. I moved right in and we started recording. He wasn’t a rapper at this time, mind you. Never asked me for rent, never asked me for anything. He did these basketball tournaments where all the neighborhoods would come play each other. That’s what brought a lot of Atlanta together.
When Jeezy and Gucci was going at it — that was when everybody in Atlanta was just, like, boom. I remember being in the club when “Stay Strapped” was out — like, “We need a song.” Killer Mike, T.I., all of them had those songs bunking. That was the moment. The old 112 was just closing down and Visions was the hottest club in Atlanta.
Lo used to always be pushing us. When Dem Franchize Boyz jumped off, I developed my style right there. I was like, they’re trying to rhyme like this, so I’m going to do something totally different. I started yelling and screaming on everything. I was, like, ain’t nobody doing this.
Right to this day, put “Tatted Up” on — you can put it up against any Grammy that’s ever been won. Just the end of the song — [ sings ] “Barbaraaaaaa!” People would be like, “Who is Barbara!?” That’s what I heard in the track, bro.
I’ve always been dancing. When the other guys made “Lean Wit It, Rock Wit It,” I was, like, “No, this is our movement.” I felt like I should’ve been given some type of credit. You can hear me on “Betcha Can’t Do It Like Me” — I felt offended.
I seen them on “Rap City” or something, and they asked who came up with the dance. And this guy goes, “Me.” I leaned back in my chair and was like, “Yo, turn the beat on.” And I got right in the booth. The snap era was intense, the competition.
With “Laffy Taffy” we went straight to MTV — BET wasn’t playing the song. We didn’t understand what crossing over was. We didn’t know that this was another level — like, “You’re No. 1.” I think we wanted to prove for a while that we wasn’t pop.
Anytime you see something that you don’t understand or that’s different, you’re going to look at it with that side-eye, you know? Nas said “hip-hop is dead,” I seen Ghostface Killah imitating the leg thing. But I’m just trying not to eat ketchup sandwiches anymore, dude.
I think when Busta Rhymes kicked it with us and jumped on the album, we started getting a little respect. And then Twista jumped on the record. People was like, “OK, well, these guys must have something.” These are two different characters from two different places that bought into the movement.
Future, Young Thug, all these cats showed me love. Drake, when he put that “snappin’ like you Fabo” in “Nice for What,” bro, my grandmother was like, “Drake said your name!” I’m one of the only artists to have a No. 1 single and have my name called in another No. 1 single.
PITBULL
My first memory of hip-hop would have to be around third grade when I first heard 2 Live Crew. Bass music was basically taking over Miami and, you know, you always wanna listen to what you’re not supposed to be listening to. You could hear it in the corner spots where they were washing cars and the flea markets. Another place where I would find music was this thing called the Box, that was basically something that you could see on local television. At the time that was our MTV before MTV.
But bass music has always been about underground. It’s all about pirate stations. It was all about, No. 1, finding a way to get this music out because nobody would believe in it. No. 2, it was too nasty, too dirty, too raunchy for them. And so we always had to find ways to get this out.
It always feels like we’re the underdogs in Miami, because we’re used to being counted out. Pirate radio, independent labels — that independence allows us to maneuver and navigate differently so we are not, for lack of a better term, choked by a major corporation or company.
I started the whole freestyle thing when I was about 15, 16 years old. I went to a lot of different schools in Miami. Lived in a lot of different neighborhoods, good neighborhoods, bad neighborhoods, worse neighborhoods. And Miami being the melting pot that it is, it allowed me to dibble and dabble in different genres and different cultures. So I could spit at you in English, Spanish, throw some patois at you, throw a little Creole in there as well.
A teacher happened to change my life. Her name is Hope Martinez, and she gave me an invitation to a DMX video shoot. I ended up battling an artist from the Ruff Ryders called Drag-On. It went eight rounds. I did my job, and Irv Gotti pulled me to the side and asked me, “Hey, do you write music?” I said, no, I just freestyle. He said, “Yeah, freestyle is great, but it don’t make no money.”
My brothers had a lot of Eric B. & Rakim, Pete Rock & CL Smooth, Black Moon — they had a lot of hip-hop. But what I really related to is when I heard Nas, “Illmatic,” when he’s using lines like “Got my first piece of ass, smokin’ blunts with hash/Now it’s all about cash in abundance.” You know, these are things I can relate to, these are things going on in my neighborhood.
B.I.G. was such an amazing storyteller. Pac was a revolutionist, Snoop had a flow that you never heard before and Jay-Z was the ultimate hustler-slash-entrepreneur at the time, and I grew up around a lot of entrepreneurs. They had their startups. They were looking for angel investors. They just had a different product. It was called cocaine.
Latins have always been involved in hip-hop, from the days of graffiti and breakdancing. You had your Mellow Man Ace, you had your Kid Frost. You even had Gerardo, which is what really broke Interscope Records. Then you had Cypress Hill, where you had a Mexican and a Cuban represented at the same time. And then you have Fat Joe, and from Fat Joe, you have Big Pun. Pun was arguably one of the best rappers ever in the history of hip-hop. He just didn’t have the time to prove himself.
Now remember I grew up around merengue and salsa. And then around dancehall reggae, and you have reggaeton, all this that you could throw in the pot with rap. I was never afraid to think out of the box. People don’t want to try that because it might mess with their credibility. I say if you’re worried about your credibility, you were never credible in the first place.
The person that really pulled me to the side, this had to be about 2002, was Lil Jon. He said, “You need to rap more in Spanish. I see how you flipping it. I see how you taking it in and out, but you need to rap more in Spanish.” So he’s the one that really saw it and said, there’s gonna be a lane here. And sure enough, the lane exploded, in the middle of hip-hop, crunk and reggaeton. And that’s where I was at.
DJ JUBILEE
I started DJing in 1982. I went to college in ’84. I was on the microphone then. I was doing all the parties in North Louisiana, Grambling State University. But when I graduated and I came home, I started DJing the high school dances. I used to bring local rappers in, but they used to come in cussing so much I couldn’t really put them on the mic because we at a high school dance. So we started making up certain dances after that. When I saw somebody do something, I’d just name it.
A friend of mine named Tyrone Jones had did a slide dance one time, we was at Grambling State University during the homecoming. So when I went back to New Orleans, I started doing the dance and then I just put my name on it. I started saying “do the Jubilee, do the Jubilee.” Then the next week, two other guys in the St. Thomas named Chris and Beanhead, they came and did the Beenie Weenie.
So now every week, somebody come with a different dance. We got different areas bringing up different dances. You got the Magnolia came with the Eddie Bow, the Calliope Projects came with the Jerk, and the St. Thomas came with the Jubilee All, the KC, the Law Law, the Eldon Delloyd, the Sissy Leroy, the Sissy Chris. So we had multiple dances that’s going on every week, and that what’s made my high school dances the livest high school dances during the summertime.
So after that one day I just start making up a rhyme to it. “Stop, pause, stand up tall/Yeah, do the Jubilee, all/Do the Jubilee, all.” And next week, “Stop, pause, pass the towel/Yeah, and do the Eddie Bow.” And before you know it, I had like 26, 27 dances. I was forced to try to get it on an album because when I recorded in the club live, a friend of mine who was another DJ started selling the tape. He got $30!
That’s when DJ Jubilee was born. When I did “Jubilee All” and I dropped the tape, we put out 500 tapes in the stores, they all left the stores in five minutes. People started calling back, “Man, you got more?” So that took me away from the DJing to the music business.
For bounce, there’s the originators: you got TT Tucker, DJ Jimi, Everlasting Hitman, Pimp Daddy. Those was the rappers in the foundation of our music. When I changed the whole game from rapping to dancing, then you had multiple artists that came after me — Choppa, Hot Boy Ronald, Big Freedia, Katey Red.
When I started saying, “Back that thang up, back that thang up,” I didn’t know that that was going to take off like it did. “Get Ready, Ready!” was already hot when my “Back That Thang Up” came out. You know how girls started bending over and then walking up back into you?
Once I hit that chorus line — “First ya wiggle ya leg, cause ya ’bout to get rough/Won’t ya bend it on over/Now back that thang up, back that thang up” — that really influenced the whole city. Women started shaking it even more. But the best part about my stuff there? All of it was made up in the street at a block party. It was made up at a high school dance.
I signed a multimillion-dollar deal with Tommy Boy — 1998, I was hot, they flew me down to Miami, I did the Impact Convention, $100,000 signing bonus. It was supposed to be a seven-album deal, $3 million. I still got the contract. But when I came back a couple of months later, they changed their phone numbers on us. I’m still kind of like puzzled how it happened. I dropped the song in ’98. I was hot all the way through ’98.
When ’99 came around, somebody said Juvenile got a song called “Back That Thang Up.” I didn’t hear it at first, but a kid at the high school played for me. He was shooting a video at City Park in New Orleans, so I went to the video shoot. He had a little rhyme to it and that catch phrase, “back that thang up,” he did it a little different. We went to court. We tried to prove copyright infringement, but they didn’t see it that way. I lost the lawsuit. But I think I really influenced it because he knew my song was the hottest.
His blew up, took off. If you ever noticed, he says, “Cash Money Records taking over for the ’99 and the 2000.” Well, I dropped this in January ’98. But years passed by, we’re still friends today. We still do concerts today. We’re all grown. That was supposed to be my time for me to blow up, to make all my money. But I guess God didn’t plan it that way.
STYLES P
That era, the late ’80s and ’90s, was like the Marvel Universe but for rappers — same universe, different heroes. It felt like we were witnessing the evolution, the growth of this thing we have.
What I felt was always great was the Native Tongues, from De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest to Queen Latifah to Black Sheep. It was always dope to have people — especially during that time period when it was pretty rough in the ’80s, early ’90s — have that amount of confidence to be different. It solidified how dope they were, because most people were just emulating what was hot. I think De La and Tribe was good especially for young fellas on the block who didn’t want to be a drug dealer, you know what I’m saying? To know I could be cool and not be into violence. I thought that that was an important element to add into what was going on.
In our lane, we were looking at Mobb Deep, M.O.P., Wu-Tang, those three immediately come to mind. Nas kind of ushered in our age class, and what was going on with the youth outside during that time period. He was a child of the grandmasters, I would say. He was definitely a product of Kane, Kool G Rap, KRS-One and Rakim, but mixed with what was going on outside at that time. We’re getting cars and chains and nice gear and all of that off of the streets, but we into our rhymes. The Golden Era babies is what I like to call us. I don’t think before that nor after that was ever as competitive as that time period.
Kool G and Kane are on “The Symphony,” but there is no Kane and KRS song, no Kane and Rakim song. In the ’90s, though, you was hopping on verses with each other, you got people from different boroughs, different places. You couldn’t be trash during that era — you was not getting recognized. I would never disrespect those who came before me, but there was people out when Rakim, Kane, Kool G Rap, KRS, EPMD, Jungle Brothers, all of them was out that was absolute trash and still getting recognition, getting honored, getting love. During Mobb Deep, Wu, us, Nas, Hov, Big, Rae, Ghost, you couldn’t say a trash verse or you was trash. Our whole career was that competition. I definitely believe people got scared to put us on their records.
But let’s even take albums out the mix. With mixtapes, you wanted to be in that No. 1 slot. So if you know anything about the Lox in the mixtape era, we was always the No. 1 slot. I remember going to DJ Clue sessions and seeing different artists there and going, oh, we’re gonna absolutely make the illest record. This gotta be No. 1 when the tape come on. I remember doing the Stretch Armstrong freestyle going, oh no, we gotta burn this. This is Stretch. This is getting heard.
And then after that period, everybody’s all super friendly. Internet fame and Instagram and Twitter and all of this to where it’s a lot of fluff. Celebrities like being with other celebrities, but they wasn’t trying to burn nobody on the mic. I can’t say the whole era is guilty — Cole is gonna try to burn you, Kendrick’s gonna try to burn you. But that don’t stand for the whole. They just rather stand with each other, take a picture and be dope, get in the studio, make a catchy song but not really try to burn each other. So I feel fortunate we came from the most competitive time period in hip-hop that may ever exist.
I’m from the Lox. When you’re in a group, that natural sense of competitiveness comes out. You want the best for the group, but nobody ever wants to be second fiddle. You don’t wanna get ate. Never. I never make a verse and go, I want to have the least favorite verse. Never. I always want the best verse. If it doesn’t happen, I’m cool and I’m comfortable and it is what it is. It’s like ballplayers getting on the court. Yeah, you on your team and you want the team to win, but who goes, “I want him to win M.V.P.”? Nobody.
SLUG
When I first became aware of “Rapper’s Delight,” it was my dad’s music. It was him playing it in his car, right next to Earth, Wind & Fire. I remember it reminding me a little bit of “Sesame Street.” It wasn’t until Run-DMC happened that I was like, this is not my dad’s music. I think he was not into it, maybe? And that made me go, oh, you don’t like that? I love it.
Melle Mel, I love him to death. He’s probably my first favorite rapper. But he was an old man to me. Run-DMC, even though they were older than me, it didn’t have that feeling. These are teenagers yelling at me. Run-DMC made me start buying records. They pushed me to become a full-time 11-year-old advocate in South Minneapolis.
By ’88, the golden year when all the great records came out, I had a crate of records, really good ones. I knew how to mix, so I was able to make blend tapes for people at school. Also in ’88, I started rapping in talent shows, but not because I wanted to be a rapper. It was just more eyes on me. I would’ve been a breakdancer. I would’ve been a backup dancer for you.
There was an older rapper, Spawn, who wanted me to be his DJ. At one point, he was like, Hey, you still rap? Why don’t you do a song with me instead of just being the DJ? The first song that I rapped on with him was very Das EFX-like. He did the production, very Beatnuts-influenced. And I’m rapping iggity piggity diggitys. I had not found my voice yet. I was still in that abyss of I can do iggitys, I can do a high voice like Sadat X, I know how to write straightforward like Ice Cube. I could do my version of all these people that I loved. It’s so far removed from what I eventually became known for.
Me and Spawn would show up at battles. I was a little younger. I was a little feistier. People saw me as a target back then. I didn’t care if I won, which is the most dangerous kind of battle because I will say some [expletive] that was super mean or harsh or degrading, and didn’t even care if it rhymed. So I was also creating adversaries, and that played as much of a role as reinforcing to me that I’m supposed to do this as any validation from the audience.
I worked retail at the time. And so I was as tapped in as anybody in the city could be. I was looking at Rawkus, they had some money behind it that they didn’t ever talk about. Seeing L.A. and what was happening with Freestyle Fellowship and that scene there, all amazing artists, knowing they get a lot of attention. They’re critical darlings.
I looked at all this like, y’all don’t know what real independence is. We’re here in Minneapolis where nobody’s checking for it. The only thing more independent than us is a rapper in Des Moines. Like, I would sleep on your couch in Dallas in order to show up the next day and rap for 20 minutes in the clothes that I slept in the night before. I really didn’t give a [expletive].
It gave me a freedom of nobody’s really listening, so I can take risks maybe that I wouldn’t be able to take if I was signed to Tommy Boy. I’m glad I said Tommy Boy, because that brings me to De La, who were a huge influence on the type of risks that I wanted to take.
I feel like I always kind of gravitated towards the people who were like, how do I either intentionally stand out or how do I express myself how I want to and still sound good?
Early on, when a rap crew would drop an album and all my friends would be like, oh my God, Grand Puba is so good, I would be like, what? No, Sadat X is the one. Kool Keith was the one in Ultramag. Everybody else was kinda like, oh, Ced Gee, he’s really rapping. What is Kool Keith talking about? I don’t care what he’s talking about — listen to him. Zev Love X, the style that he wrote with. De La, the style that they wrote with, specifically Posdnuos, but also Trugoy. I love A Tribe Called Quest. What I liked about Q-Tip’s style was that he would just figure out a way to say it that nobody’s ever said it like that before.
The emotional storytelling I ended up doing had less to do with an audience and more to do with what kind of life experience I was trying to have. I was heavily under the influence of the romanticism of people like Charles Bukowski. The drinkers and the tragedies. I wasn’t much for parties, but I liked caves. I liked dark spaces with a couple of people getting wasted, talking until the sun comes up, and then waking up the next day and not remembering what we did. I was fueled by waking up and not knowing where I was. It was a blurry couple of years, but it was very impactful because it was at the same time that my career was starting to do things.
People were validating the [expletive] that I was writing, and they were saying things to me not about my rapping, not about the songs, but about the actual words. All of this is feeding into my ego, and so I leaned into it because of how good it felt. And because, you know, let’s keep it simple, whatever traumas I had as a child needed to be dealt with. This was my self-medication for it. I didn’t know yet that the easiest colors to paint with are the darker colors.
It would’ve been this way if I had been a plumber, though. I would’ve been a messy plumber.
STIC
My older brother, who is eight years my senior, had brought some records home, and it was something that I had never heard. We were in Shadeville, dirt road Florida. We weren’t in the Bronx. He tells me, “This is called hip-hop. There’s a DJ and there’s a rapper, an MC.” He was like, “We’re going to do hip-hop.” I was maybe 8, 9. It was this group called Whistle, “Just Buggin’.” OK. Boom. And then my job was to start studying.
I would write LL Cool J’s rhymes, I would write KRS-One’s rhymes, I would write Big Daddy Kane’s rhymes on notebook paper. I didn’t have none of these terms for the technical things at that time, but I did it based on the breathing. “OK, this is where he’s taking a breath.” So I’d start another line.
I also listened to other music besides just New York. Too Short was a huge influence on me. I used to try to remember all them 80,000-bar verses he had.
I got kicked out of high school for rapping, actually, at a Black History Month assembly. They said it incited a riot.
I was known as the little rapping dude, and my teacher in ninth grade, Ms. Green, was the only Black lady I had seen in the school system with a natural ’fro. She stopped me in the hallway one day and she goes, “Do you know that in all the history of this school, in this racist institution, y’all ain’t never even had a Black history assembly?”
She was like, “I’m going to give you an opportunity: You can take your talent and do something with it. If you write a rap for Black history, I’mma let you perform at the first Black history assembly this school has ever seen.” And I was like, “Uhhh, I get to rock? Bet.”
She took me to the library — I remember because I skipped lunch — and she pulled out these three books. The first page I open up, I see Huey P. Newton. And I’m like, “Who is this?” Because it look like my cousin Carlo, right?
I ended up writing a song titled “Black As I Can Get.” What they seemed to have a big problem with was, “I ain’t no Uncle Tom/To hell with Uncle Sam.” When I said that, they cut the mic off, turned the lights on and everything. Next thing you know it was a melee.
PHONTE
The most vivid memory of hip-hop that I have is my uncle Brod, he took me to the Fresh Fest when it came to the Greensboro Coliseum. This had to be like ’85, ’86. It was Run-DMC, the Fat Boys and Whodini, and yeah, I think my fate was sealed after seeing that. My uncle bought me a Fat Boys T-shirt. I remember Run going back and forth across the stage, just the stage presence. Whodini — God, rest in peace, Ecstasy. He came out, he had the hat on, “Freaks Come Out At Night,” all of that. I remember just feeling that energy and being like, “Yeah, this is what I want to do.”
The biggest influence on how I rhymed was probably Big Daddy Kane. I always liked how Kane was. He was kind of every man, he could do it all. He could battle, he could talk to the ladies. He could be the mack, the cool pimp guy, whatever. He was smart. He would dance. He was the total package. And so my mic technique was definitely influenced by Kane, and that school of Kool G Rap, Rakim, that’s the cloth that I’m cut from in terms of that super precise flow. Sonic-wise, my biggest inspiration was A Tribe Called Quest. I wanted to rap like Kane, but I wanted our records to sound really lush and kind of beautiful, like a Tribe album, you know what I mean? That was kind of my M.O. and still is in a lot of ways, I think.
The hip-hop that I was raised on, a lot of it was Native Tongues. The Jungle Brothers, A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, and even Pete Rock and CL Smooth and Heavy D. There was always an element of singing of vocals in it. To me, it just felt like a natural extension of the records that I grew up listening to. I was born in ’78, so my mother, she always played R&B: Luther, Patti, Stevie. On our first album, “The Listening,” our first single, that’s me singing the hook.
If there was an album that was important to the way I worked, I would split the difference between two albums: “De La Soul Is Dead,” and “Death Certificate” by Ice Cube. I mean, “Death Certificate,” that was a movie on wax. It was no surprise to me that Ice Cube was able to transition into being a director and screenwriter, because he was making movies on his records back then. “Death Certificate,” I mean, I played the words off that album. Nowadays, I think sampling-wise, it would kind of be impossible to make. Well, impossible to legally make. And “De La Soul Is Dead” for reasons that, I mean, are kind of obvious, I can’t say enough about just how much I love that album, how much it influenced me.
When we were coming out, this was ’01, ’02, peak Soulquarians era. So this is the Roots, it’s Slum Village, it’s Common, it’s Black Star. It’s what Rawkus was doing at that time. I was very adamant on, “Listen dude, we’re not competing against other artists in North Carolina or other artists in our city. We’re competing against ‘Fantastic, Vol. 2,’ we’re competing against ‘Like Water for Chocolate.’ We’re competing against ‘Black on Both Sides.’ If we ain’t got nothing that’s coming with this level of smoke, then we just need to leave this alone, because that’s what we’re up against.”
BIG GIPP
My homeboy had to remind me last night, he said, “Gipp, do you realize that you’ve been involved in every era of music from Atlanta?” I said, “Wow.”
This lady named Jean Carne was a soul singer who moved to my neighborhood with her son Joseph — she had this song called “Closer Than Close.” The same year, a guy named Ray Murray moved into our neighborhood.
Once we got together, Ms. Carne bought her son our first studio. And I remember the first time he called us to say, “Yo, my mom bought me a studio,” because that was the same day LL Cool J dropped “Jack the Ripper.” It’s so cemented in my memory. We played that record over and over and over.
Ms. Carne started taking me around — that was my introduction to the music business. She is a cousin of Peabo Bryson. At her house, I got to meet Stevie Wonder, I got to meet New Edition — I got to meet the industry before I got into the industry. Her daughter had a birthday party and we went with the Jackson 5. Atlanta was filled with so many superstars, just because of the civil rights movement: Larry Blackmon was riding around, Curtis Mayfield was riding around, Kool & the Gang was riding around.
Ray started teaching me how to rap. The first records he gave me were the Last Poets, KRS-One, just to give me substance, you know? But I created myself through two artists: Chuck D of Public Enemy and Ice-T. I learned more from Chuck D than in school. Ice-T represented that player lifestyle — that caught a young dude real early. “Power,” I remember looking at the album cover like, “Yo! You’re my guy.”
I was working at a Red Lobster on Campbellton Road as a dishwasher, and one day I was listening to Public Enemy. This guy beside me was from New York. He said, “Hey, Gipp, you like that group?” I said, “I don’t like this group, I love this group.” He said, “Would you like to meet them?” I’m tripping because we in Red Lobster; we washing dishes. “Well, my name’s Mike. Professor Griff is my little brother. They’re coming to town and I’ll take you to meet them.”
He took me down to Fulton County Stadium, and I remember this night not for the concert, but because of the way that Chuck D came to the concert: They were headlining and Chuck D pulled up in a cab. That was something that stuck with me for the rest of my career.
N.W.A changed the whole temperature. It kind of stopped music for a minute. It really put the aggression into rap that wasn’t there before. And then came Geto Boys. When they say, “Who was the greatest in the South?” Scarface, period. As a kid, Scarface was our Ice Cube in the South.
Every day there was new music coming out. It was so exciting. Everywhere you go someone would be, like, “You heard this?” And it was such a change from being a kid in Atlanta, because Atlanta was so soul — there wasn’t nothing bigger than the Commodores, O’Jays, Gladys Knight, Curtis Mayfield.
Goodie Mob, we gave you the heart and soul of where we was from. We gave you everything that brought us up, everything we was made from, what our mothers taught us, how we were raised.
We didn’t come from the projects. I’ve always been around affluent Black people, religious Black people — that’s all I’ve ever seen. Drug dealers and gangsters had never been prevalent in the city because nothing could be bigger than the King. That’s the reason why you had Goodie Mob speaking the way we spoke. Even at a young age, we rapped like grown men. We still gave you “Dirty South,” we still took you into the projects, into the streets. We did all of that. We just did it from a place of always knowing we had something better.
It’s also because we were signed by Babyface and L.A. Reid. We were never on a rap label and all the things our counterparts were getting away with, we couldn’t get away with. I remember when Babyface was like, “A song ain’t a song until you have a hook and a bridge.” And that’s all he ever said to us.
I was very much influenced by wrestling. I got to see artists like Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes, the Road Warriors all up close. The costumes — I knew what it did to people when they saw it. That’s the reason we started doing that in the Dungeon Family. We knew that if people didn’t understand us, maybe they would remember what we looked like.
Who would’ve knew Outkast and Goodie Mob could’ve been this? I don’t think anybody has a André 3000 in their crew but us. I don’t think anybody got a CeeLo Green in their crew but us. How could you beat somebody like us? All you’ve gotta do is say, “CeeLo, do some Gnarls Barkley,” and it’s over.
Every time the South creates a new style, they find something not to like about it. But if you think about it, we have not stopped since us. When you look at Future — that’s family, from the Dungeon — Ying Yang Twins, Lil Jon, Ludacris, T.I., Jeezy, Gucci Mane. They didn’t like the Migos at first!
As long as Atlanta has a strip club culture, we will always be ahead of everybody. Somebody could take a Young Thug record right out the studio at Patchwerk, go right into Magic City Monday, get the prettiest stripper to dance to it, and it’s a hit record! It’s just something that doesn’t stop working.
UNCLE LUKE
This DJ on the radio named Jimmy G, that was the first time I ever heard rap on the radio. He would put the instrumental on and be like, “One day of victory, one day of defeat/Got to learn to take the bitter with the sweet.” When you look back on it, he was rapping, before “Rapper’s Delight.”
He would play Sugarhill Gang and T La Rock and Divine Sounds and Cold Crush Brothers and Furious Five. I was a member of a record pool, so I started getting these records. I would book the artist and have them come down on PEOPLExpress and perform at my teen discos and clubs. Mantronix, Dr. Jeckyll & Mr. Hyde. Jazzy Jay, that was his first flight ever. Run-DMC, I used to bring them down, pay them 1,200 bucks.
When I brought 2 Live Crew down — that was a California crew then — I wasn’t interested in being no record executive. Nobody did hip-hop in the South, so I decided, you know, I don’t take no for an answer, I’ll do it myself. I was interning at the record station, so when the DJ was in the back snorting cocaine, I would be in there playing the records on the radio, and at the same time playing my commercials for free.
My unique style of DJing was talking on the mic, getting the crowd hype, doing all the chants. So they were like, man, you need to come and be in the group. The first song was “Throw the D.” It was a dance that we created in the party. That was the first Miami bass song.
But to me, Original Concept “Can You Feel It?” and T La Rock “It’s Yours,” those were bass records. “It’s Yours” is the first bass record in my opinion. It had everything that a DJ from Miami wanted in a record. It was slow, but it had the booming bass that everybody played at the party.
In the beginning nobody really latched on, it was like foreign to everybody. The guys from Orlando and Jacksonville started copying what we were doing. The “Dazzey Duks” guys. This other record label out of Fort Lauderdale did songs around the same time we were doing it, that’s where MC Shy D was. And then you had Lil Jon start doing bass, the R&B version of it. And then the guys in Atlanta started doing it, Kizzy Rock and DJ Smurf.
People don’t realize there was no hip-hop in the South. Zero. No Texas, no Georgia, no Memphis, no nothing. I would go do shows in Atlanta, and they would have New York DJs on their radio. And so I tell people I created hip-hop in the South. People have a tendency of trying to put me in a box of just Miami. No, I inspired everybody. Tell me who was before us?
And I inspired people to be independent, too. You had Master P with “Ice Cream Man” and I tried to sign him up and he said, no, I want to do what you doing. And I was like, I respect that. I tried to go to Oakland and sign up Too Short, and he was selling out the trunk his car like me. He was like, no, I’m doing it on my own, and I respected it.
BIG BOI
It was like the X-Men School of Superheroes at the Dungeon, you know? All of us — Outkast, Goodie Mob, Organized Noize — the whole crew down there just sharpening up our lyrical skills, getting ready for the world.
It was me and Dre going back and forth. We’d just rap, trade our bars. That’s how we got our deal, actually. Big Gipp was playing the “Scenario,” Tribe Called Quest remix. He had the Isuzu Trooper and Rico Wade worked at a beauty supply store. Me and Dre was up there and then he played the instrumental and we just rapped for the longest time. And Rico was like, “OK, y’all going to the Dungeon.”
We didn’t know how to count bars or nothing. When we got to the Dungeon, one day we learned formatting. With the Organized Noize masters, they just taught us how to do it. Me, Dre and Cee-Lo were like 16 and 17, and everybody else was pushing 20.
Everybody was there: Cool Breeze, Backbone, Witchdoctor. Then later on you had Future. Everything was organic and it was like a school of brothers. And we all came up together. We didn’t go to school together, but we were in school together.
A group called Parental Advisory was there before us — KP the Great, Mello and Reese. They had a song called “Manifest” and it was a jam, a dark, real gritty song. It was underground. They were the first ones and we came after them.
When we did “Player’s Ball,” we got $100,000 each from our publishing deal at Christmas ’cause it went No. 1. When you come from nothing, $100,000 is like $1,000,000, you know what I mean? We were millionaires before we were 21.
And then what we did was, of course, we bought a car. But we took the rest of the money and we bought equipment, an MPC60 drum machine. A lot of people don’t know that we produced a lot of our records, from “ATLiens” on up to “Idlewild.” Songs like “Ms. Jackson,” “Bombs Over Baghdad,” “Aquemini” — we did those. From watching Organized Noize, it was like, OK, if we’re going to be MCs, how cool would it be to paint the soundscape and write the message?
I’m known for being half of the ’Kast and one whole of me. The globe knows us, whether it’s film and television or at my kids’ recitals or football games. The brand is prestigious. They had an Outkast bobblehead night at the Braves stadium. We didn’t have to perform a song, but the whole city came out to get these bobbleheads. It was beautiful, man.
ROC MARCIANO
We used to breakdance — put down our little cardboard, you know, the early days of Run-DMC blasting out the big speakers: “Peter Piper picked peppers.” I remember just being a kid walking to the park and hearing it on the bass speakers. Like, it sounds foreign, something I’d never heard before in my life.
Just looking at how they were dressed — leather gooses and Adidas and suede Pumas — you really identify with that because that’s what you saw dudes in the neighborhoods wearing. Before that, entertainers, you expect to see them in suits — a little more like costumes.
My first album that I ever had was a Christmas gift, and it was “Follow the Leader.” I remember running home from school to the closest spot we could get to — it was, like, my boy’s crib — because they said the new Rakim video was coming out. The “Let the Rhythm Hit ’Em” video, dude sitting on the Rolls-Royce, it was like a damn movie.
Rakim presented hip-hop in a way where I felt like I could participate. It wasn’t in your face with the showmanship. He was more cool and laid back. You could just tell he was rhyming with his inside voice, displaying intelligence. I felt like I could become an MC.
I wasn’t thinking about making songs. Back in the day, it was more like the cypher, battling, who got the best rhymes. At that age, you don’t even have beats to make songs.
I went to school with Busta’s younger brother. I had a reputation around the town for rhyming. So when Busta was starting to develop his own label, when he was first starting Flipmode, he had reached out.
Being around Busta, I learned how hard it is to be successful in the entertainment business. He’s literally like a cyborg. He doesn’t sleep. Like, he works every day, in the studio every single night, you know? I was, like, man, at what point do you celebrate being rich and famous? Success isn’t a destination, it’s a constant voyage.
The internet changed everything. People are sharing music and you can’t keep things suppressed like you probably could at one point. You know, it only takes one person you like to post something that they like, and then bang, you know?
The transition when it became more about the internet really benefited me, because around that time I couldn’t get a deal with a major label after my Flipmode situation. Like, OK, cool, we don’t need the middleman anymore. We could just upload our music and just let the fans decide what they rocking with.
Not only me — it’s helped a bunch of us become heroes. My guy Bronson, Ka, Westside and Griselda, Hommy, Currensy — I’d say I was instrumental in most of their startups. It’s just mutual respect. Lil B, you know what I’m saying? That’s definitely somebody I linked up with that probably people wouldn’t have expected me to be a big fan of. I like that he’s fearless.
Young Thug, too. When Thug came on the scene I was, like, Man, this dude’s a genius. This is like James Brown 3000! I don’t know what he’s saying, I just know that sounds funky .
You know, living in New York City most of my life, I’ve never heard MF Doom on the radio once. And he’s a legend. You could see the disconnect. Doom was doing this before all of us, this independent grind.
To a certain degree, I would say Long Island artists are slighted. Rakim, EPMD, De La Soul, MF Doom, myself — it’s a lot of heat coming out of Long Island, you know what I’m saying? And Prodigy is from Long Island. I feel like saying it’s unsung would be untrue. But we definitely have a steeper hill to climb than maybe if we were from Brooklyn or Queens.
ROXANNE SHANTE
Nipsey Russell was a comedian who had the ability to make words rhyme anytime, about anything. My first time being exposed to him was on “Hollywood Squares” or something, and he went on from the moment he started to the moment he left the show. I said, “Yeah, I can do that.”
I remember trying it for the entire day, from the moment I got off the bed to when I brushed my teeth, when I’m in the kitchen doing dishes, and by the end of the day, I felt like I had it down pat. I guess that was the origin of Roxanne Shanté.
I grew up in Queensbridge public housing — the largest housing project in the world — going to park jams, when neighborhood DJs would bring out their equipment and their speakers. I remember the very first time ever going to listen and hearing, “Bertha’s going to be there!” So, I’m thinking she’s this woman that brings this party. Later on, I found out that Bertha was actually a speaker.
Once you went to a park jam in Queensbridge, it was something that was in you. It’s like being young and leaving a karate movie and all of a sudden you want to kick, you want to chop, you want to try it. You felt like, I got to be able to do this.
The acoustics in the hallway in the projects have a little echo to it. For some reason the beat sounds really good when you bang on the wall in the projects, or if you bang on a stair railing, or even in the elevator. We would just rhyme, which is what I nicknamed the Nipsey Russell syndrome, because sometimes you can’t cut it off.
When hip-hop started, I was 3. I didn’t get a chance to be exposed to MCs from the Bronx. For me, everything was Queens. We didn’t travel to the Bronx like that. I think every borough has its own unique origin of hip-hop.
I came in as a battle rapper. By the time I was 15 years old, they wouldn’t allow me to even enter into MC contests anymore. “Is this the little girl with the braces? No, she can’t enter.” It actually became a source of income from my household. We would find flyers. “Oh yes, let me go get that money.” There weren’t any other women that were like me because I was willing to battle male, female, whoever came along.
That’s why my first record happened to be a battle record and an answer record to “Roxanne Roxanne” by UTFO. Everyone was playing it throughout the projects, and I love the beat because it’s one of those easy beats that you can do on the wall: boom, boom, boom-boom.
For “Roxanne’s Revenge,” I actually wasn’t trying to make a record. I was going to do laundry and hip-hop producer Marley Marl, who happened to live right above the laundromat, said, “Hey, listen, I need you to come to my house. I heard that you can rhyme. It’s not going to take you long.”
I said, “You’re right, it’s not going to take too long. So, let me go put my clothes in the laundry.” When I went up to his house, he played the instrumental of “Roxanne Roxanne,” and I just did a freestyle, you know, using my Nipsey Russell syndrome. I finished it, and I went back downstairs and did laundry. I never wanted to make records or pursue a hip-hop career. I never wanted to do any of that.
There was over 86 response records that were made just for Roxanne Shanté, and we will never have that again. One of the surefire ways in order to be heard at the time, especially during and after the Roxanne Wars, was to make a record about Roxanne Shanté, because she will answer it. She’ll battle anybody.
I was supposed to get a pair of western Sergio Valente jeans, because Marley Marl worked at the factory. Growing up in the projects, you would do anything for a pair of jeans. That seemed like a fair exchange, but I never got the Sergios. I need to say that: I got a hell of a career, but I never got the jeans.
BUSTA RHYMES
I had a couple of big homies that was real grown. I was still in my single-digit years, and they had these Five-Percent Nation brothers in my neighborhood. They were the ones circulating a lot of the tapes — Kool Moe Dee vs. Busy Bee and the Cold Crush Brothers battles. And as “Rapper’s Delight” started playing on the radio, they had an underground station called WHBI, I think 105.9, that used to come on at 2 o’clock in the morning until like 5.
The Supreme Team used to spin on there. The Awesome Two, Special K and Teddy Ted was spinning on there. And they had Zulu Nation radio on the same station, so sometimes Red Alert, Afrika Islam and Jazzy Jay. I would make these pause tapes and then go to school and front like I went to the battles with my big cousins and sell them for $5.
I was up that late because I found out about this station from the son of a Panamanian lady that used to babysit me when my mother was working nights. The Panamanian lady, who I love to this day, her son exposed me to graffiti. He would have this black book that he would draw the pieces he was going to spray-paint on subways. I would sit there and just be entertained, looking at a live-and-in-person movie. These were my first experiences witnessing hip-hop firsthand.
When they had the block parties in the neighborhood, that’s when I was able to really get to see the DJing and the dudes on the microphone. Everybody would be outside until shots blew on the block. But it never ended unless somebody got shot or police came.
My whole lyricism, my showmanship, I definitely attribute a lot of that to Grandmaster Caz, even though I love the whole Cold Crush. I emulated a lot just in terms of my charisma and wanting to be the leader of the crew. I loved the Sugarhill Gang, but when I found out later on that Caz wrote all of Big Bank Hank’s rhymes, that affected my appreciation.
There was also the component of my Jamaican upbringing. In Brooklyn there was this melting pot of every Caribbean community in existence. It wasn’t just about hip-hop. You had Haitians, Trinidadians, Guyanese, Jamaicans, Bajans, Panamanians. This was a significant influence on my showmanship, everything I was doing from the way I dressed to the energy that was in my shows, their flow patterns and the way they spit on dancehall records, the heavy bass line beats. I encompassed all of that into my imagination but in a hip-hop way.
I moved to Uniondale, Long Island, in 1983 when I was 12. We were all finding mischief way too soon according to our parents’ standards. They saw us going down these wrong paths. Coming from where we came from, you kind of looked at it like, “Damn, man. Long Island soft. I don’t want to go out there and be around all this grass and flower beds, around some white kids that don’t know hip-hop culture.” But that common denominator is what allowed the Leaders of the New School to connect. Because the hood was still in the suburbs.
We officially started the group around ’86, but I didn’t have the name Busta Rhymes yet. My name was Chill-O-Ski. The way we got with Chuck D and them was at a talent show that was happening in Hempstead. There were 20 to 30 groups in the lineup, and we waited all the way until the very end. Chuck D invited us out to Spectrum City Studios in Hempstead, along with some other groups.
There was a board that had all these different group names on it like Son of Bazerk, Funky Frank and the Street Force, Young Black Teenagers and Leaders of the New School. And we had to listen to them try to split our group up and put us in one that they felt we fit most with. We were like, “We didn’t come up here to be broken up.” And they respected that.
We told them that we wanted the name Leaders of the New School, and the white kid that actually ended up becoming a member of Young Black Teenagers, he wanted the same name. So we ended up having to do a battle. And they said y’all want the name that bad then y’all need to make a song called “____ the Old School.” We didn’t want to do that because we was never raised to disrespect anything before us. But it was really just a test to see how bad we wanted it. That “____ the Old School” will never surface online.
What was cool and interesting about that time was that being smart and being positive outweighed everything else. You didn’t have too many gangster rappers. There was a large Five-Percent Nation presence. It was Poor Righteous Teachers, it was Rakim, it was Lakim Shabazz, it was King Sun, it was Just-Ice. Zulu Nation was present. There were a lot of uplifting Black power movements that were happening. If you wasn’t smart, you were looked at as a real bozo.
We had Queen Latifah, MC Lyte, Salt-N-Pepa. We always had braggadocious [expletive]. We had “I’m Bad,” real machismo, and girls saying that they were sexy, but you wasn’t really hearing about how dudes were out here selling drugs, shooting. I’m not saying that any of that is wrong. Everything in hip-hop has its place. But I think too much of one thing in anything in life is not a good thing.
When Leaders of the New School was poppin’ and things started to get active for us, that created some internal conflict. The consumer started to gravitate towards who their favorite MC was in the group. In that transition, I was really on my grind crazy because I was the youngest in the group, but the first one to have a child.
As far as “Scenario,” I knew my life changed after that. Q-Tip was always like my big brother and one of my closest friends. It was quite obvious when that record came out I was set up to steal the show. When I came on the mic with my “dungeon dragon” [expletive], it was definitely a showstopping moment.
At that time, the grand finale dude was the one who ended the song. “Scenario,” I was last. “Flava in Ya Ear,” I was last. “A Buncha ____” on “Blue Funk,” Heavy D’s album, I was last. “Come on Down” on Big Daddy Kane’s “Prince of Darkness” album. When you stealing the show, you were last.
“Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See” was a turning point for my life, the first time people heard me spit on a song calmly. It’s safe to say it’s one of the greatest records ever made in the history of the culture. I ain’t saying that because it was me. I’m saying that because it’s the general consensus across the board to this day.
EASY AD
My location was around Vyse Avenue, 174th Street, 171st Street, 173rd Street, right over the bridge from the Bronx River. I started hearing music in the parks just before the summer of the blackout, 1977. It was more funky, it hadn’t crossed over to the hip-hop era.
DJ Hollywood is older, he was doing the club thing, Club 371. They were considered more like a disco type of DJs at that particular time. We didn’t wear the things that our predecessors wore. We wore sneakers, things that was very comfortable for us. We also had the atmosphere, the B-boy, breaking. In ’78, ’79, a lot of parties started happening, places started opening up to hip-hop. The Dixie Club on Freeman Street, Lovebug Starski started playing at the Burger King.
I started writing rhymes around ’77 when I was in the Hoe Avenue Boys & Girls Club. The Furious Three, the Furious Four, the Furious Five — they were really, really good on the mic. They were the MC group that pushed you to want to push yourself. Then it was the L Brothers with Master Rob and Kevie Kev. They were really out there too, playing the Dover and a lot of community centers.
The first group I was with was the AsSalaam Brothers. After we broke up, Donald D and myself went to try out for the Funk Machine. He made it, I didn’t. Then I joined the Cold Crush.
As hip-hop progressed and everybody got really good, we used to have meetings at the Police Athletic League with this guy named Blood. All the groups who were established at the time, it was Flash and the Furious Five, the Funky Four Plus One More, Cold Crush Brothers, AJ and Busy Bee. And the Mercedes Ladies was there as well. And we had meetings because we wanted to establish that if one group was playing in a particular borough, the other groups would play outside the five boroughs. That was something that no one talked about.
Flash, Disco Bee, they had a sound system. They used to record tapes. Then you had AJ and Busy Bee, they used to record. L Brothers had tapes. But their sound systems and their tapes were not crispy clear, because people used to stand in front of their system with a radio and record it. So one of my friends from fourth grade, his name is Elvis, he was actually the first tape master in the world of hip-hop as we know it. We let him plug directly into our system.
Once he plugged into our system, that was the end of that — Cold Crush tapes went triple platinum all over the world.
The tapes used to be distributed in this way: If you had a brother that was in the Army or Navy, in Japan or Germany, they used to mail the tape there. So our tapes got distribution all over the world. And they were clear as well, so it was like you were actually at the party.
Also back in the early days, there was this car service called OJ. You can rent an OJ for $40, put it on hold for an entire day. In the OJ they always had the hottest cassette tape. And so there was Cold Crush tapes in there.
One of our biggest tapes was when we battled the Fantastic Five for hip-hop supremacy in 1981 at Harlem World. That tape kind of changed the complexity of the culture , meaning that the rhyming style that was done by the other MCs, we changed that ’cause it was becoming kind of boring. So we brought a different kind of rhyme style to the table, along with the showmanship and stage performances.
When “Rapper’s Delight” came out, we were already past that style and that kind of flow. And they weren’t really part of the hip-hop community, so no one really took them seriously, the record wasn’t being celebrated. We actually did not wanna make records at all. We didn’t understand the value of them because we had something to us that was very valuable at that particular time — our stage show and our tapes.
Later on, Russell Simmons approached us when Run-DMC was just getting kind of hot. He said, “My brothers are getting bigheaded. I want them to battle y’all so y’all can show them exactly what it’s all about.” Later on we found out that he had gave them a cassette tape and told them that this is the group that you have to be better than. So they study our tapes and our style. So when you see Run-DMC, you see a part of us and our flow and our hard rhyming style.
In 1984 when “Sucker MCs” was the hottest record in the country, we had a show in Chicopee, Massachusetts, at a roller skating rink, Run-DMC and the Cold Crush Brothers. We did our show and we do what we do. We rocked it. But they were the hottest, they were the bigger ticket. But it was very humbling and honorable, they came into our dressing room and said, “Listen, we want to be like y’all. Y’all are the standard which we want to get to.”
LIL BABY
Jeezy and 50 Cent — I remember my older sister had both CDs. I was born in 1994. I’m young, but I was hanging outside, so I was hanging around older guys. I’d already seen how they was living, how they was moving. The older guys was glorifying them. As I’m listening and I’m learning, it kind of shaped my life to this day, honestly.
You wanted the tank top, you wanted the money, you wanted to have that street feeling, like wherever you go, you’re the man. That’s what I got from Jeezy and 50 Cent.
I remember being 10, 11, I used to go on YouTube at my grandma’s house all day. Sometimes they had the lyrics, sometimes they didn’t. The songs that didn’t, I’d write the lyrics down myself. I’d listen to the first bar, figure it out and write it down.
It was local Atlanta artists — these were teen club songs. There wasn’t young rappers all around the world like there is now. Skooly with the Rich Kidz, “hundred thousand dollars in a rubber band.” Different little crews — the MDC boys had a song called “Splash Gang”; Yung Booke, “Sack Right, We Straight” went crazy; Yung Woo, “She Everything I Need.” We had them little MP3 players that you clicked.
Boosie’s always been a favorite, too. More than anything, he was from across the tracks. We were from across the tracks. He had them real neighborhood stories.
Music’s always been my inspiration, getting in my vibe, get my head going. But I didn’t ever think it could do nothing for me. That’s why I never did it.
I got out of prison on July 1, 2016. I went to the studio that day, put the headphones on and tried something. But I didn’t really make nothing. I remember telling one of my friends, “I don’t feel it yet. I’m gonna wait until I run me a bankroll up, and then I’m gonna come back.”
From always reading the lyrics growing up, I knew you needed a verse and then a hook and another verse. I sat in the studio with Young Thug, Migos, Peewee Longway, KC Da Beatmonster. I had a couple little buddies with those little in-the-closet studios.
Most of it was from watching — I’m a visual learner. That’s why I never write nothing down. To this day, I’ve never really seen the writing process, where they’re really writing raps. The punch-in process is freestyling, but not really freestyling. One line at a time, sometimes two lines at a time, sometimes three.
That first time I posted a song on my page and it went viral, I kinda liked that feeling. I never released the song, because it wasn’t actually a whole song. Me and Marlo, “Set Up Shop,” was the first song I recorded that came out. The next full song I recorded was “Option.” People loved it, but it was kind of cheesy to me. When “My Dawg” came out, I was like, “This is the one.”
The first time I got booked was at Club Bankhead, $750. Then I booked myself on Mondays at Crucial, the littest in Atlanta. We’d come in 50 deep, buying bottles. It was a wave. They were booking me for less than it cost me to come in there. But it was just the fact that we were getting paid to come.
Then I was booked Thursday to Sunday, performing at little clubs, the chitlin circuit. Every weekend, I’ve got a concert. I’d go to these new places and the song would come on and they’d go word for word. That’s how I knew every song was a hit.
I got a song like, “This month I want seven/I’ve been going up/next month I want 10.” That was for a show, I was getting $7,000. That journey, it’s been there in my songs. I went from 7 to 10 to 50 to 60, then 150 then 200 then 250 then 400 then a million. And it ain’t going to stop until I stop.
I’m not saying it to brag, I was actually proud of it each time. Like $7,000 — I was astonished. “I get $7,000 to rap!?” I couldn’t have been more proud. You know what I had to do to make $7,000? And they’d give it to me to go in the club and have fun? Life is a dream, almost.
Gucci Mane has definitely been one of several mascots for Atlanta. He put it on his back. Me and Gucci met before I started rapping, from the streets. Thug’s like my brother, we grew up together, versus Gucci Mane, who was like an idol. Guwap was like unc.
Ralo was one who gave me a sense, too, that I could do it. Because I know he’s a street dude. Even though Young Thug was a street dude, he’s been a rapper the whole time, so I never looked at him like he was doing what I could. That was his God-given talent and gift.
I look at all the people, even to this day, that are still in the game after 20, 30 years. I take bits and pieces from everybody, but the people I study the most are people who lasted for a long time. Swizz Beatz is one of my close mentors. I enrolled in his business class at Harvard. And I also study the people who didn’t last, who went out quick. I try to see who all has been at my level and then lost it — how they lost it, what they did wrong. I study that.
I appreciate Drake more than words can explain. But when he first called me for a Drake feature, I didn’t understand music the way that I do now. I think that’s why I did so good. I wasn’t like, “Oh my God, it’s Drake.” I didn’t know the real worth of it. I didn’t know what he was about to do for me. But that’s how I was able to get on there and just be free. Now it’s even harder for me to do a Drake record, because I know what I’m up against.
I used to be on some, “I ain’t no rapper, I’m a street [expletive].” Now I’m not a rapper, I’m a businessman. Rapping is still a business. As good a rapper as I need to be, I need to be a better businessman.
Hip-hop has opened every door for me — the people I meet to the way I set a trust up for my kids, every single thing for me in my life. Getting my record clean, setting a foundation for my family, not having to look over my shoulder.
I was just in prison in 2016. Now it’s 2023 and I’m almost on the top of the world. I’m sitting in an office now and I’ve got 300 pieces of mail. I’ve been an adult and not gotten a single piece of mail. Nobody had my address, all the bills were in somebody else’s name. Now I’ve been gone a week, I come home and I’ve got 300 pieces of mail.
LIL BIBBY
DMX’s album when he had the fully red cover, with the blood everywhere — I had it on cassette. When I saw the picture, I got scared. I was a little kid. What’s the one where he was back and forth with different voices? “Damien!” I heard that and I said, “Is this the devil?”
To be honest with you, I used to be realistic with myself when I was young: “I already know I’m gonna die and go to jail, so who cares?” And then when I started doing music, it just worked really fast and it kind of changed all our lives.
We watched Chief Keef come up. I feel like the whole world watched Keef come up. We were all young, and it was crazy to see someone from our city become so big so quickly.
Once the music started picking up and people started paying attention, the spotlight was on Chicago. I feel like it made me take it seriously. It gave me some motivation — like, OK, maybe I don’t have to die, maybe I don’t have to go to jail.
Drake reached out — that happened super early. He reacted to “Kill ____” with Herb. I was probably only rapping for nine months, and then Drake started hitting me up and invited me to his show. I was a big Lil Wayne fan, Gucci Mane fan, a big Drake fan.
When you just doing you, you never really think about how big it is getting or who’s copying it. I’ll explain the Chicago drill sound that the U.K. and New York is doing: It’s this thing that we used to do in Chicago called footworking — the footworking beats was heavy percussion, like with the ticks.
This producer from Chicago named DJ L, he used to make every beat sound like a footwork beat. And I used to scream at him like, “Dude, I don’t wanna rap on all footworking beats! Can you make different beats?” And he just couldn’t. He was our in-house producer, so we just used to be stuck rapping on these footworking type of beats. And the whole world just started doing it. It’s a Chicago thing.
I never really think about it like that, but every now and then, I think, we just started this in the closet . Social media definitely helped the drill movement, but when I look back at it, the [expletive] we was doing was so crazy. We didn’t do a lot of thinking.
I think most Chicago artists didn’t reach their peak. Most of them passed away. It’s like crabs in the barrel. We Chicago people got trust issues — I always think somebody trying to get over on us. I don’t think we really understand the business that well. Then you feel vulnerable, like you don’t know enough. Atlanta or L.A. always have the older people that’s well seasoned on the business.
I always thought about the bigger picture, where I’m trying to go, you know what I’m saying? Since I started listening to Jay-Z, I was always like, what would Jay-Z do? That’s how I based my career.
NONAME
In terms of song structure, I was really inspired by Kanye West, Common, Lupe Fiasco and Mos Def — that type of rap where there can be messaging and maybe some political themes, but the song is pretty standard in terms of hooks and bridges. A lot of sung choruses, that kind of a thing. I tend to like writing hooks that are catchy. I really like catchy-sounding production with thoughtful lyricism. That’s what I tend to gravitate to.
I have this very vivid memory of my mom playing “Late Registration” in her Nissan Pathfinder when I was a kid, and just being in the back seat, listening.
And then when I wanted my songs to be a little more deconstructed, Jay Electronica and Earl Sweatshirt. “Eternal Sunshine (The Pledge),” that tape from Jay, I’ve never heard a rap album sound like that, or someone attempt to rap to a movie score. That was very eye-opening to me, in terms of what the genre could do. Same with MF Doom, “Madvillainy.” I had never heard anything like that. “Oh, rap could do this?”
At the time, I wasn’t really a hip-hop head. When I was a kid, I was probably listening to Michael Jackson and Avril Lavigne. I was listening to a lot of Bow Wow, actually. Like, a lot. Teenybopper hip-hop. “Doggy Bag,” 2001 — wow. He definitely had a moment. That was my childhood, as far as rap was concerned. It was not exciting.
A lot of the stuff that I was into was based on what I could listen to. My mom wasn’t really allowing me to listen to too much. She was like, “You can listen to this Michael Jackson and one Kanye album.” And whatever’s playing on the radio. It was that vibe. I would go to my friend’s house and they would be listening to Wayne mixtapes.
I’m just now starting to become a real music fan, where I can listen to a lot more genres and styles. Stylistically, in terms of pockets and playing around with language, my generation doesn’t really do that that much, just across the board. And that’s the type of hip-hop that I think I like the most. I’ve been going back to Slick Rick and Big Pun, Big L, stuff that’s either punchline driven or people are just hitting very crazy pockets. As far as new rappers, probably Boldy James, billy woods, Silkmoney. You know Babyface Ray? I liked his last tape.
I’m kind of late being a musician. I don’t know why I make the type of music that I make sometimes. Because it’s truly not really popular. I feel like everyone is trying to stay away from the type of stuff that I do because they want money. They want to sustain themselves. Not even trying to be self-deprecating, but I really don’t hear folks making kind of weird poetic [expletive] like this.
Although hip-hop wasn’t my entry point, being in organizing spaces — Black radical spaces where folks are thinking about leftist politics and ideologies — I was able to find rappers and hip-hop artists that actually do make that type of music. I guess it does lead back into hip-hop, which I didn’t realize. Aspects of it were in the Black radical tradition. I wish that aspect of it was a bit more to the mainstream, but it is what it is.
PAUL WALL
Seeing hip-hop on MTV or BET, that was a different type of hip-hop. It was all East Coast predominant. Even on the radio in Houston, I remember hearing West Coast music and wondering like, why? The East Coast, a lot of what they said, I didn’t know what they were talking about, ’cause, you know, the translation is a little bit different in the slang. We understood the West Coast a little bit more ’cause it was like a migration of people from the South that moved to the West Coast, and a lot of their music was funk- or blues-based, similar to how a lot of Southern music and hip-hop was blues-based.
But when we heard the Texas music, that’s when we heard people speaking our language to us. The Geto Boys and the Screwed Up Click, it was all kind of the same era for me. Rap-A-Lot was seen as the super mainstream, they represented us on a worldwide scale, where the Screwed Up Click was more of an underground thing. We took pride in both of them, but for different reasons.
I remember being like 15, this would’ve been ’97, riding in one of my friends’ car, going to school, him rifling through just different mixtapes and then putting a Screw tape on, that’s how we would listen to it.
A lot of that era was very territorial. The Screw tapes and Screwed Up Click was a Southside thing, but it was almost like blasphemy if you were on the Northside listening to the Screw tapes. I was an undercover Screw head, it only would be a few of us really listening to the Screw tapes like that. There was a few people that I went to school with that moved from the Southside to the Northside, so they would have the new Screw tapes, “Hey, this is what I got when I went to my grandma house this weekend.” If you had that Screw tape, you would be the man.
When I started working, I would be like stocking shelves, overnight type stuff, no customers in the store. So you turn on the “attention shopper” monitor, put a rubber band around it and have a radio playing a Screw tape all through the store.
Listening to Screw tapes, it’d be a particular artist freestyling that really clicked with you. I really liked Lil’ Keke, Fat Pat, Big Pokey. You’d be like, “Which is the one where Lil’ Keke is rapping on the MC Lyte beat? Let me find that one.”
They weren’t confined by the vocabulary you’re taught in the book. They created their own vocabulary. Keke specifically is a wordsmith who would just create his own words, his own slang. I mean, honestly, any slang that we know today that’s Houston-related or Texas-related, Keke’s the one who said it first about 95% of the time.
When it comes to Fat Pat, he had a swag to him with him being a big boy but also real player. A lot of the music he made was about girls liking him, so it was that whole player swag. That’s who you would idolize or look to be. Fat Pat’s the first person I ever heard talk about having diamonds in his teeth.
Big Pokey was laid back, he had a softer tone to his voice, but it also was like very deep and aggressive at the same time. So him being nicknamed the hardest pit in the litter, it really fit him because it was almost like a growl of a dog when you heard him rap.
My favorite Screw tapes, there’s a few of them. “Leanin’ on a Switch” is probably my favorite one. “Who’s Next Wit Plex” is another. Still to this day, when I’m riding around, I’ll put ’em on.
When the Swishahouse came about and started to be a Northside thing, then it was like, oh we can do it too. Of the Swishahouse tapes, a lot of my favorites are the Slim Thug freestyles. “Northside 9,” “Northside 10,” where I remember Slim Thug and J-Dawg just going off. Also in the Swishahouse, they would do this thing where it would be four or five people and they would say one or two lines and then it’d go to the next person, like a pass the mic kind of thing, but you wouldn’t spit a whole verse. Unfortunately, I never got to be a part of that. But those are some of the most iconic Swishahouse freestyles.
I made regular-speed music and it being slowed down was something you would dream of — making a song and it got to be so popular or big that a DJ, whether it be DJ Screw, Michael Watts, DJ Bone, any of these other DJs would slow it down and you’d hear it on a mixtape.
Michael Watts opening the door, allowing me to rap with the Swishahouse, was something where I was able to showcase my talent in a different way. I did two freestyles for Watts, and one of the ones we did was a intro for his radio show. And I remember hearing that on the radio like, man, we on the radio with a freestyle! Like, that’s crazy. So many people are trying to make it that traditional path that you gonna be waiting forever. But if you go one of these other ways and do something different, then you’ll be first in line.
RZA
Summer of 1976: A young kid who had just come back from North Carolina into the streets of Staten Island. There was a block party being thrown by a local DJ, I think DJ Quincy. The DJ had jacked power from the street lamps, plugged up his system and was playing music. And even though I was a kid that shouldn’t have been there — it was past bedtime — I was there. The music, the turntablism of him spinning the record back and forth, the guy on the mic reciting lyrics, DJ Punch. Immediately, I fell in love. I had to be 7 years old.
I remember the lyric the guy said: “Dip, dip, dive/so socialized/you clean out your ears and you open your eyes.” When you just look at those words right there, it really makes a lot of sense.
It was a life-changing year for me. I stayed in New York that summer, and then we went back down South. I had to come back to New York in 1977 and was stuck here ever since.
My cousin, the GZA, who lived on Staten Island at that time, had cousins in Queens and in the Bronx. Soundview Projects in the Bronx was one of the founding projects of hip-hop. Being a few years older than me, GZA would take me up to the Bronx and that’s where I would hear MCs. We could say our style is traced back to the Bronx because it was Soundview Projects that really put the most inspiration on us. And of course, Jamaica, Queens.
At 11, you was almost an adult, especially in poverty situations. I’m talking about going from Park Hill, Staten Island, to the Wilson stop in Bushwick on the L train, and I did that every morning. That was just New York life.
GZA was already an MC. I would just recite whatever he said, copy it. At the age of 9, I wrote my own first lyric. I would sit in school and just write lyrics all day. That was the kind of brain I had.
Before the Sugarhill Gang had a record on the radio, all we had was tapes. Cold Crush versus the Fantastic Freaks, Cold Crush versus the Force MCs, Busy Bee versus Kool Moe Dee. Those tapes, those Harlem World tapes, those uptown Bronx tapes circulating through the neighborhoods, those were our teachers.
But when I heard them on the radio, I was convinced that one day my voice was going to be on the radio. Me, O.D.B. and the GZA, we just pursued it. We would travel throughout New York, any opportunity that we could to show that we had talent.
We had bad contracts. The first contract, I’m glad I didn’t sign it. GZA and Ol’ Dirty signed it — we was probably 15, 16 years old, and it didn’t work. My first contract of course was with Tommy Boy at 19 years old, and that didn’t work either. I felt abandoned by the label. I felt that the best way to do it was to do it ourselves.
I formed my own company first, Wu-Tang Productions, and started selling records out of the trunk. Then when Loud got wind of us and offered us a deal, I went, “Nah. I can’t tie every member of this crew down to one location. This crew is big and we have to spread our wings. We have to take our talent and spread it through the industry.” I felt it was going to be impossible for all this energy to come out of one faucet. “Nah, I need more spigots.”
I thought that hip-hop was losing its roots.
And I knew that me, the GZA, Ol’ Dirty, Method Man, Ghost, we were purists. My plan was to infiltrate the industry. The purity of the culture was taking a left turn already in the ’90s, and I felt that we should enter the arena but spread it out like 36 chambers. We want our chambers to be everywhere.
You think about before us in the ’60s and ’70s, you got Elijah Muhammad making different temples around the country. Or Marcus Garvey giving us the idea that we as Black men and women have to stand up and be noble and plant our flags, calculate our lives. Those things were in the back of my head as an entrepreneur and as an artist.
Prior to us entering the industry, we always felt that Eric B. & Rakim, KRS-One, Run-DMC, Big Daddy Kane, LL Cool J — there was a moment in hip-hop, between like 1985 and 1988, that was just powerful, influential and pure still. And then ’89, ’90, ’91, it started getting diluted.
So then when we came in, we felt we was bringing it back pure, and our contemporaries, as well: Biggie Smalls, Nas, Mobb Deep, Busta Rhymes, Outkast. Our early shows, it was Outkast and Wu-Tang, popping up in Chicago. Ice Cube was probably the headliner, and we were the opening act. And a few of the underground peers who didn’t fully hit the chart surface: Brand Nubian, of course, De La Soul, Duck Down.
Hip-hop is a sport. Now Wu-Tang, of course, being nine MCs and egotistic, even though those were our peers, we felt we were the best. We felt nobody could beat Wu-Tang. That’s the Wu-Tang spirit.
When we hit No. 1 on the charts in the summer of ’97, beating the country artists and rock artists, it was like, “Wow, we did it.” And the cool thing about it was like it was without being pop. It wasn’t like we had a Top 40 record. It was just the culture itself, the path we walked.
TRINA
My beginning is watching Queen Latifah, MC Lyte, Salt-N-Pepa. I just loved them. They were different because they were from up north and wore the baggy clothes. They were just girls and they was so fire. I saw them on TV and I was obsessed.
I remember begging my mom to take me to Salt-N-Pepa’s concert in Miami. I had to be 14, 15. I had my asymmetrical haircut, my little colorful jacket on and my long onesie thing. I was dressed just like them. I thought I was one of the girls.
In concert, it was really overwhelming because they were really, really good. They were dancing and singing and rapping and performing and the DJ, Spinderella, was there. I thought, wow, this is just amazing. And it’s just all girls.
I first did the record with Trick Daddy as a favor. I didn’t know it was going to be a song. I just thought it was an intro of me talking slick to him, going back and forth, arguing with friends. But when I got there, and he played it, I was like, “What do I say to this?” I was so nervous.
But I had my friends with me and they’re real feisty. They was just like, boosting me up: “Oh, no, we got to get him out of here. We got this.” We was all in the booth and they was like, “You gotta kill him on the track. You gotta go nastier.” I was writing stuff down, scratching it off, balling the paper up. And they were like, “No, nastier. We gotta go harder.”
We called Trick, and when he came back and heard the song, he went nuts. He called the owner of the label, and I knew him from growing up. He was like, “That’s Trina who?” Trick was like, “Trina — the only Trina.” “No, it’s not.” “Yes, it is!” And when he came to the studio, he was like, “Oh, no, we signing you to a record deal.” I just left and they were stalking me for weeks and weeks.
They came to my mom’s house looking for me. I’m not interested. I’m going to be a Realtor. I just got my license. There’s no way. I went to Trick’s birthday party, and they tricked me. He wanted to perform the song and I was too shy. I got on the stage and when the song came on, I didn’t say nothing. My eyes was closed. I didn’t say not one word, but every girl in the whole entire club said the song.
The next week, he had a birthday party in Tallahassee. I came out and killed it. I was scared, but I was ready to perform after that.
Once I did the “Nann” record, immediately, I got signed to Atlantic Records. Boom, right after that, I got called to do a Ludacris record, the remix to “What’s Your Fantasy?” So now it’s these two records blowing up at the same time.
I was in the studio a lot with Trick. We had Money Mark and C.O., Tre+6, Duece Poppi. There was Plies and there was Rick Ross. I kind of followed Ross. I would not turn in no records if he didn’t approve. That gave me security of how to put the records together.
Later on, I was battling with the label about certain records that I wanted to do, because I had grown from the records like “Nann,” and they wanted those particular records. I wanted to do these records talking about how I really felt. They felt like that stuff’s soft and your fans are not soft. I had to stand firm in the paint, do what I felt and make them believe that I can make music that I believed in.
“Nann” was fun. That was dope. That was Trick’s idea. I came in, I did my thing. But now here is Trina, and Trina is a woman and she is not 19 anymore. She’s growing, and she’s been through all different kinds of things. And it worked.
Here we are 23 years later. There’s so many girls, you can’t even keep count now. What I love about that, is there was a time there was no girls. It was just four or five of us. Now there’s so much more versatility — there’s the City Girls, there’s Flo Milli, Lady London, KaMillion, Coi Leray, GloRilla, Doechii. It just feels like Ladies Night right now.
VANILLA ICE
I’m the first global hip-hop artist in the world. I don’t care who you put before me or after me, I’m the first. I put rap music in front of people’s ears who never considered or even heard of it. I hit Saudi Arabia, bro. I’ve played Iran. I’ve played in front of the Taliban and Hezbollah, and they’d sing “Ice Ice Baby.” They don’t hold the American thing against you. They look at you like, “This is Vanilla Ice.” And they treat you like royalty.
You have to understand that I grew up with poetry. When I was in the seventh grade trying to get the chicks, instead of writing love notes to these little girls, I was writing love poems. And it worked really well. I had no idea that that poetry was going to lead to my career. But the passion never left. It just kept escalating.
My mom was really good at it, too. She had these one-liners. I’m a big one-liner guy: “Drop that zero, get with the hero.” “If there’s a problem, yo, I’ll solve it.” I could run for president, bro. “Let’s make America the ’90s again.”
I got involved in “Beat Street” and “Electric Boogaloo,” the “Breakin’” movies. I was a breakdancer. I would make 40 bucks a day at the mall, spinning on my head with some cardboard and a giant jambox. Chase the girls around, eat some pizza, have some change left over.
I went to high school in Dallas, and I would spend all my summers in Miami. The whole Miami booty shake thing that everybody remembers from the late ’80s really didn’t exist yet. There was no models, Kardashians, Versaces, not even 2 Live Crew. Nobody here in Miami influenced me whatsoever.
Hip-hop was way bigger in Dallas than it was Miami in the ’80s. I thought all white people were listening to the same music across the country, and nobody was. I was the only one. I had an older brother — he was listening to Aerosmith, Foghat, Mötley Crüe. I hated that. It didn’t make me want to breakdance. Rap just fit me better than O.J.’s glove. It really did. Scott La Rock, KRS-One, Mantronix.
I grew up with D.O.C. — Fila Fresh Crew was his first rap act that nobody even knows about, and that was in Dallas. He had a big hit back in the day, “Whirlwind Pyramid.” Everybody knows he wrote all the lyrics for everybody on “The Chronic.” KNON Radio, a pirate station, that was big. Dr. Rock, Big Al. Just straight from their attic. It was so freakin’ hip-hop and so culturized.
We had a place called City Lights, where I went with my brother’s fake ID. I entered into the talent contest because I’m a battle rapper, I freestyle. I feel like I’m the best. I don’t give a damn who you are — Eminem, Ice Cube, Ice-T.
We would also go to a place called Handy Dan’s, in the back of a hardware store where we would have keg parties. You could park behind it and the cops couldn’t find you. We would have these rap battles against other schools. I had to show up and blow up, you know?
Back then we didn’t have any kind of FruityLoops or Pro Tools or computers at all. There wasn’t even a smartphone. It cost money to go into a studio. I have a lot of self-discipline, and a lot of competitive drive from motocross, because I’ve been racing since I was 8. I went out and made my money on the motocross track, 1,500 bucks a week. I found a guy in Houston who made ecstasy pills for $2 apiece in his bathtub, which was legal back then, by the way, and I sold them for 20 bucks. Instead of blowing it on my car, now I’m blowing it on the studio, hoping this works out.
I blew it up, man. I went on the Stop the Violence tour with Ice-T, Stetsasonic, EPMD, Sir Mix-a-Lot. They were rap gods at the time. I was the opening act for the opening act for the opening act for the opening act for the opener. I was there so frickin’ early, the other acts were still in their hotel.
I had a 10-minute set, me and my breakdancing crew. I had a few songs — “Ice Ice Baby,” “Play That Funky Music,” a song that was never released called “My Car Goes Boom.” I never got so much love in my whole life. I guess word gets out that there’s this white kid that’s just crushin’ it out there, so people start coming earlier to the shows. It got so much attention it went to the headliner act, Ice-T. I saw him sitting there on a road case watching me. He was the first one to tell the other acts, “You’ve got to come see this white boy. He’s dancing his ass off.” And the next night there was Chuck D sitting on the road case with Ice-T.
Chuck D actually discovered me. My first record deal had come from Ichiban Records out of Atlanta. I was on there with Curtis Mayfield. The album was called “Hooked,” which is the same songs as “To the Extreme,” just remixed. Then Chuck D called Def Jam. We had it all lined up. I was on my way to New York, ready to sign, all dreams about to come true. And I get a phone call from my manager, and he says, “Don’t sign with Def Jam.”
He came in and he explained to me this guy named Charles Koppelman from EMI Records wants to meet me. It’s the craziest thing that could happen to any musician. I did “Ice Ice Baby” and then three years go by with the blink of an eye. It took on a life of its own.
You can’t pick your audience; they pick you, bro. And I got picked. Whether you like it or you hate it, you’re not going to stop it. They used me as a product on the shelf. All kinds of funny, laughable things like “In Living Color,” “Saturday Night Live,” “Arsenio Hall Show.” It was just a big wave of entertainment. And if you didn’t recognize it or use it, then your ratings were low. Vanilla Ice was the ratings, and that was it. The most controversial artist on the planet.
The adversity that I’ve had to face is probably more than any rapper in the history of the world. I’ve always been offended by anybody calling me a “white rapper.” You’re racist if you say that. Music shouldn’t have a color. Do you call Jimi Hendrix the Black rocker? My song was No. 1 before anybody knew what color I was. I was influenced by hip-hop. You can’t name any genre or any kind of person or ethnic background that is not influenced by it.
Don’t forget, a lot of these big rappers today were influenced by Vanilla Ice, OK? Nipsey Hussle admits it. You’ve got Kobe Bryant out there winning a talent contest when he was in high school dancing to “Ice Ice Baby,” doing the exact dance moves I did. The influence and the impact is undeniable. It’s possibly the biggest impact to ever hit music in music’s history next to Elvis or the Beatles.
VIOLENT J
In the seventh grade, I met John Utsler, Shaggy’s older brother, and an original member of I.C.P. He showed me “Roxanne, Roxanne,” and all the battling they were doing. He put me up on Eazy-E. How was a seventh grader copping these vinyl records and where was he finding them at? There was no internet. It’s almost supernatural. Maybe he was listening to the Wizard on WJLB at night or something.
We would watch “Yo! MTV Raps” when it only came on for an hour. And we would also watch Channel 62, which is a local channel, and they had a show called “The New Dance Show” and they would spin local rappers’ videos. Really cheap-made local rapper videos, but they were our heroes: Awesome Dré, A.W.O.L., Detroit’s Most Wanted, Smiley, Prince Vince and the Hip Hop Force, Merciless Ameer, Kaos & Mystro, DJ Duncan Hines.
Awesome Dré’s “You Can’t Hold Me Back” album and “Straight Outta Compton,” they just lived in our CD player. It took our love of pro wrestling away, which had been our goal. But we couldn’t deny it no more, man. We wanted to do hip-hop. As far as flow, my three main guys were Ice Cube, Awesome Dré and Esham. Now Eazy-E, I love Eazy-E’s voice, but Ice Cube on “Dope Man” is just a beast. He’s coming from the gut so hard.
Because people have called us horrorcore artists, I wanted to know about horror in hip-hop. My own personal investigation leads me to Houston, Texas, Prince Johnny C. That first Geto Boys record was all normal except for this one song called “Assassins”: “My father was a priest, cold blooded he’s dead/Hypocrite, I caught him basin’, so I shot him in the head/Poured on the holy water, ‘Bless the dead’ is what I said/Then heard the demon screaming as his body bled.” Nobody was talking like that. What I do and what Esham did comes from Prince Johnny C’s original idea.
I used to have cassette cases full of tapes of local rappers. If I’d seen anything that was actually pressed up, I had to have it. So I walk into a store and there’s this guy Esham and he’s got an album out and two EPs. He’s rapping about the scariest [expletive] I’ve ever heard. He’s rapping about the devil, 666, crucifix. It was insane. And he sounds like the devil, his voice.He became our biggest influence. The sky would turn red when we’d play his CDs.
We looked at Detroit, we saw Kid Rock riding in a tractor in his video. He had Too Short producing tracks on there. He was touring with Ice Cube. He was rapping about being from 32 Mile Road, which is way the [expletive] out. It was unique, it was different. We’re like, wow, this kid’s way out, redneck-style, and he’s rapping. And then we’re looking at Esham coming out onstage in a coffin, rapping about the devil.
So we were like, this is what Detroit does — theatrics. Plus we’re huge wrestling fans. We put face paint on after our first EP. The way Kiss does it in rock, in rap who’s doing that, you know? It felt natural. It wasn’t awkward. And we’ve been doing it ever since.
Right from the rip, we did everything ourselves. We pressed our CDs up, we advertised ourselves. And we hired Esham and Kid Rock, the two biggest rappers in Detroit, to be on our first CD. We had Michigan on lock. And Toledo and parts of Ohio. I’m talking 3,000 people at a show. We couldn’t do [expletive] in Pittsburgh if we went there, though.
I remember in ’95, Onyx and Das EFX were going on tour. We got on that tour somehow. We got booed off every night, sometimes violently. It was probably 400 people at every show that we went to. We got to Michigan, 2,200 people packed, sold out. Onyx came to us and was like … We went out last. It was three shows we did like that — Detroit, Flint and Toledo.
That was our first tour.
After ’95 we toured nonstop, but our experiences with touring with other rap groups are very minimal. For multiple reasons, but the Faygo is a main one. If they have their equipment up there, it’s gonna be all wet. Like, we’ve played with Snoop Dogg, but he’s had to go on first, which sucked, because people leave. But he ain’t gonna go on after we destroyed the stage with the Faygo.
In ’94, we got asked to be part of this big rap show in Toledo. It was Outkast, Coolio, a bunch more. We were so honored to be on a lineup like that. So we do the show and afterward the Outkast guys surround us and they’re like, you got your [expletive] soda all over our [expletive]. So we had to pay ’em money for cleaning and everything. People were mad at us and we weren’t trying to get nobody mad at us. We just wanted to do our thing.
You know, there’s a lot of reasons why we’re in this place we’re in. It’s a benefit because the Juggalos are the [expletive] and very supportive. But people look at Juggalos like they’re not people. They say, the only ones that like your [expletive] are the Juggalos. What are Juggalos? They’re people!
I would love the opportunity to get out on one of these hip-hop tours and perform for an audience that ain’t ours so people might say, man, they’re actually pretty good. One time we offered Ice Cube $100,000 to spit a verse and he passed, and then years later he did it for free, out of respect. Ain’t that crazy?

Teenagers' Accidents Expose the Risks of E-Bikes: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The e-bike industry is booming, but many vehicles are not legal for teenagers, and accidents are on the rise.
On a Thursday evening in late June, Clarissa Champlain learned that her 15-year-old son Brodee had been in a terrible crash, the latest teen victim of an e-bike accident.
He had been riding from home to shot-putting practice. The e-bike, a model made by Rad Power, had a top speed of 20 miles per hour, but his route took him on a busy road with a 55-mile-per-hour limit. While turning left, he was clipped by a Nissan van and thrown violently.
Ms. Champlain rushed to the hospital and was taken to Brodee's room. She could see the marks left by the chin strap of his bike helmet. "I went to grab his head and kiss him," she recalled. "But there was no back of his head. It wasn't the skull, it was just mush."
Three days later, another teenage boy was taken to the same hospital after the e-bike he was riding collided with a car, leaving him sprawled beneath a BMW, hurt but alive. According to the police, the teen had been seen driving recklessly and was found to be at fault. In the days following, the town of Encinitas, where both incidents occurred, declared a state of emergency for e-bike safety.
The e-bike industry is booming, but the summer of 2023 has brought sharp questions about how safe e-bikes are, especially for teenagers. Many e-bikes can exceed the 20-mile-per-hour speed limit that is legal for teenagers in most states; some can exceed 55 miles per hour. But even when ridden at legal speeds, there are risks, especially for young, inexperienced riders merging into complex traffic with fast-moving cars and sometimes distracted drivers.
"The speed they are going is too fast for sidewalks, but it's too slow to be in traffic," said Jeremy Collis, a sergeant at the North Coastal Station of the San Diego County Sheriff's Office, which is investigating Brodee's accident. The investigation is ongoing pending a medical examiner's finding.
To some policymakers and law enforcement officials, the technology has far outpaced existing laws, regulations and safety guidelines. Police and industry officials charge that some companies appear to knowingly sell products that can easily evade speed limits and endanger young riders.
"It's not like a bicycle," Sergeant Collis said. "But the laws are treating it like any bicycle."
Two federal agencies, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said they were evaluating "how best to oversee the safety of e-bikes," according to a statement provided by the highway safety agency.
Communities have begun to alert their residents to the dangers of e-bikes. In June, the police department in Bend, Ore., ran a public service campaign acquainting the public with the e-bike laws that were frequently being broken there. Days later, a 15-year-old boy was killed when the e-bike he was riding was struck by a van; the driver has not been cited or charged.
Sheila Miller, who is the spokeswoman for the Bend police and helped develop the public service campaign, emphasized that not everything that calls itself an e-bike qualifies as one, or is safe or legal for minors. Under Oregon law, which is more restrictive than those in most states, a person must be at least 16 to ride an e-bike of any kind.
"Parents, please don't buy these bikes for kids when they are not legally allowed to ride them," Ms. Miller said. "And if you own an e-bike, make sure that everyone who is using them knows the rules of the road."
Booming Industry, Modest Regulation
The typical e-bike has functioning pedals as well as a motor that is recharged with an electrical cord; the pedals and the motor can be used individually or simultaneously. Unlike a combustion engine, an electric motor can accelerate instantly, which makes e-bikes appealing to ride.
E-bikes are also seen as vital in shifting the transportation system away from emission-spewing cars and the congestion they create, said Rachel Hultin, the policy and governmental affairs director for Bicycle Colorado, a nonprofit advocacy group for bicycle safety and policy. E-bikes and electric scooters are part of the so-called micromobility movement, propelling commuters and other people short distances across crowded spaces.
The number of e-bikes being sold is unclear because, like regular bikes, they do not need to be registered with the government. (Cars, motorcycles and mopeds must be registered through a state's Department of Motor Vehicles.) Many are sold directly to consumers over the internet, rather than through physical retailers that often track sales. John MacArthur, an e-bike industry expert with the Transportation Research and Education Center at Portland State University, estimated that roughly one million e-bikes would be sold in the United States this year.
The minimal regulation around e-bikes is a selling point for the industry. Super73, a company in Irvine, Calif., that makes popular models, advertises on its website: "RIDE WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS. No license, registration, or insurance required."
"It's one of the very unique categories of vehicle that there really isn't any kind of onerous regulation," a company co-founder, LeGrand Crewse, said in an interview, noting that helmet requirements were also modest, depending on the state and the rider's age.
Law enforcement officials have begun to express concerns about the minimal training required of teenage e-bike owners, and about their behavior. Car drivers ages 16 to 19 are three times as likely to be killed in a crash as drivers 20 or older, and bicyclists ages 10 to 24 have the highest rate of emergency room visits for crashes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some states have begun to raise the training requirements for young drivers, including adding graduated license programs that require extended hours of supervised driving, limit night driving or restrict the number or age of passengers.
The California Legislature is considering a bill that would prohibit e-bike use by people under 12 and "state the intent of the Legislature to create an e-bike license program with an online written test and a state-issued photo identification for those persons without a valid driver's license."
"I know the e-bike situation is evolving," said Sergeant Collis of the San Diego County Sheriff's Office. "But personally, with all these bikes, you should have at least a permit or a license to ride them at the speed they're going."
As a transportation solution, e-bikes seem promising. "I'm really bullish about middle and high schoolers being able to use e-bikes," said Ms. Hultin of Bicycle Colorado. She noted that e-bikes offered children and busy families more transportation options at lower cost. But she worried that the vehicles could lead to an unsafe mix of untrained e-cyclists and unaware car drivers.
That problem, Ms. Hultin said, was exacerbated by "an algae bloom of noncompliant e-bikes." She was referring to products on the market that call themselves e-bikes but are not, either because they can go faster than allowed by law or because, once purchased, they can be modified to do so.
One vehicle that has drawn attention for its speed is made by Sur-Ron, whose products have been involved in several recent deaths. In June in Cardiff, Wales, two boys on a Sur-Ron bike died in a crash while being followed by the police; days earlier, a boy riding a Sur-Ron in Greater Manchester had died after colliding with an ambulance.
In its marketing materials, Sur-Ron describes one model, the Light Bee Electric Bike, as "easy to maneuver like a bicycle, with the torque and power of an off-road motorcycle." Its operating manual cautions the owner to "please follow the traffic rules and with the safe speed (the top speed for this electric vehicle is 20 km/h)."
But the speed restraint -- equivalent to about 12 m.p.h. -- can be removed by simply clipping a wire, a procedure that is widely shared in online videos, and which law enforcement officials said appeared to be there by design.
"There are all kinds of videos on how to jailbreak your Sur-Ron," said Capt. Christopher McDonald of the Sheriff's Department in Orange County, Calif., where e-bike accidents and injuries are rising. With the speed wire clipped, the vehicle can approach 70 miles per hour, he said. Several requests for comment were sent through the Sur-Ron website but did not receive a response.
Matt Moore, the general counsel for PeopleForBikes, the main trade group for bicycles and e-bikes, said he worried about products like Sur-Ron's. "Some products are sold as ostensibly compliant but are easily modified by the user with the knowledge and presumably the blessing of the manufacturer," he said. "Unfortunately, there appears to be a lack of resources at the federal level to investigate and address e-mobility products that may actually be motor vehicles."
Tragedy in Encinitas
The day after Brodee entered the hospital, his family sat at his bedside. They played his favorite music, including Kendrick Lamar and early Wu-Tang Clan. "I read to him for hours," his mother said. "We wanted to wake up his brain."
Three days later, as Brodee clung to life, Niko Sougias, the owner of Charlie's Electric Bike, a popular e-bike shop in town, was driving in Encinitas on Highway 101 when he saw two teenage boys riding Sur-Rons in the opposite direction.
"They were doing wheelies," Mr. Sougias said. He has grown concerned about the e-bike industry, he said, and does not sell many models that are popular with teenagers.
His route that Saturday followed the path of the boys on the Sur-Rons. Moments later, after a turn, Mr. Sougias saw that one of the Sur-Ron riders had collided with an S.U.V., had been thrown from his bike and was under a BMW. "He was lucky to escape with his life," Mr. Sougias said.
Ms. Champlain was at the hospital with Brodee when the boy who had been riding the Sur-Ron was brought in. Paramedics stopped by Brodee's room to check in. "I can't believe I'm here again for this," she said one of them had told her; the same paramedic had brought in Brodee by ambulance.
Hours later, Brodee was pronounced dead. He was a beloved young man with a bright future ahead of him. He was fluent in Spanish and had a college-level knowledge of Japanese; he could dead-lift 300 pounds and, in 2020, was named student of the year at his high school. "I had so many people call me to tell me they'd lost their best friend," his mother said.
Ms. Champlain said witnesses had told her that her son "did everything right," including signaling to make a left turn.
"There should be more education for drivers with the change that's happened," she said. "I'd never seen an e-bike on the road until three years ago. Now I see hundreds."
"They're treated like bicycles when they're not. They're not equal."

A Cast of Minor Characters Emerges to Play Key Roles in the Trump Case: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Carlos De Oliveira and Walt Nauta, who were hired by former President Donald J. Trump despite past troubles, rely on him for their legal fees -- and are now his co-defendants.
In the early 2000s, Carlos De Oliveira was a valet and handyman at Mar-a-Lago, parking cars and doing odd jobs at Donald J. Trump's private club and residence in Florida for not much more than $ 10,000 a year, court records show.
Then, within two months in 2012, Mr. De Oliveira divorced and filed for bankruptcy. He owned a 6-year-old BMW that needed brake work, paint and its belts replaced. His checking account, the records said, held $ 700.
But over a decade, Mr. De Oliveira, a Portuguese immigrant, started slowly climbing a ladder of promotions at Mar-a-Lago. First, Mr. Trump brought him on to the maintenance staff full-time, according to a person familiar with the matter. Early last year, he was given the loftier post of Mar-a-Lago's property manager.
That was the job he held when he was named with Mr. Trump in a new indictment last week, one that accused him of conspiring with the former president and one of his personal aides to obstruct the government's efforts to retrieve dozens of highly sensitive national security documents from Mr. Trump after he left office.
Mr. De Oliveira, a minor player in the case, was ensnared in it largely because prosecutors contend he delivered a message to another Trump employee that the former president wanted to delete a trove of potentially incriminating surveillance footage at Mar-a-Lago. He was also charged with lying to investigators.
The path he followed is a familiar one in the world of Mr. Trump, who often views relationships in terms of leverage and obsesses constantly about loyalty. In his business career, as a candidate and as president, Mr. Trump has frequently plucked subordinates from trouble or obscurity and given them a lifeline -- and, by extension, a sense of obligation to him.
Those opportunities and obligations have sometimes come with a cost -- including, as in the case of Mr. De Oliveira, serious legal jeopardy.
The release of new details on Thursday in an updated indictment by the special counsel, Jack Smith, underscored the extent to which low-level workers like Mr. De Oliveira -- lacking Mr. Trump's reserves of power, fame and money -- have become embroiled in the government's attempts to hold the former president accountable for threatening national security.
The situation is even more extraordinary because Mr. De Oliveira and Mr. Trump's other co-defendant in the case, Walt Nauta, his personal aide, are relying on the former president not only for their paychecks but also their legal bills. Those are being handled by Save America PAC, one of Mr. Trump's fund-raising entities.
In a statement sent after this article was published online, Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, criticized the Justice Department.
"For the weaponized Department of Justice and the deranged Jack Smith to target innocent individuals and everyday Americans by leaking false and misleading information, which is illegal and unethical, shows just how desperate and flailing they are in order to salvage their collapsing case," he said. Mr. Cheung appeared to be referring to the details of the indictment.
"President Trump's employees are honorable, hard workers, and are the best of the best," he added. "They don't violate the law because they are law-abiding citizens."
The payment of the legal bills has been the responsibility of Susie Wiles, one of Mr. Trump's top political advisers.
She started by signing off on checks from the political action committee to lawyers for some of the former White House and campaign officials who received subpoenas in the past two years from the House select committee investigating Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. As the criminal investigations have unfolded, the number of lawyers whose payments Ms. Wiles is responsible for has grown.
Ms. Wiles also made an appearance in another portion of the indictment, where prosecutors described Mr. Trump showing a classified document to a representative of a political action committee -- identified by people familiar with the matter as Ms. Wiles.
With so much of Mr. Trump's past fund-raising spent on voluminous legal expenses, two people familiar with the matter said his advisers were creating a legal-defense fund to take on some of the costs, although the fund is not expected to cover the former president's legal fees. It is unclear how many other people the fund is intended to support. Mr. Trump's advisers have insisted there has been no effort to influence witness testimony through Save America's payment of legal fees.
While Mr. Trump plays the leading role in the indictment in the documents case, the narrative as laid out by Mr. Smith's team relies heavily on supporting characters like Mr. De Oliveira, Mr. Nauta and others.
Much of the story involves what prosecutors have said was a plot to move boxes of documents in and out of a storage room at Mar-a-Lago to avoid returning them to the government. Prosecutors say there was also a subsequent attempt to disguise those movements by seeking to delete footage from security cameras positioned outside the storage room.
According to the indictment, Mr. Nauta was central to the first part of the scheme, moving boxes from the room at least five times at Mr. Trump's direction. All of that took place during a critical moment in the government's investigation: the weeks between the issuance of a subpoena last year demanding the return of all classified documents in Mr. Trump's possession and a visit to Mar-a-Lago shortly after by prosecutors seeking to collect the materials.
Mr. Nauta's path to Mr. Trump and Mar-a-Lago was also characterized by a degree of turbulence.
A member of the Navy, Mr. Nauta had worked as a valet for Mr. Trump in the White House. But toward the end of his military career, Navy officials removed him from what is known as the Presidential Support Detail after learning he had fraternized with colleagues and subordinates in the White House mess, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
As naval officials were deciding what to do -- including the possibility of sending Mr. Nauta back out to sea on a ship -- an aide to Mr. Trump, who was already out of office, reached out to Mr. Nauta, offering him a job at Mar-a-Lago as the former president's personal aide, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Mr. Nauta leaped at the opportunity, the person said, taking the job in July 2021 after receiving an honorable discharge from the Navy. It remains unclear whether Mr. Trump knew of Mr. Nauta's troubles in the Navy at the end of his career.
Prosecutors say that they have been in touch with more than 80 witnesses while investigating Mr. Trump's handling of classified documents, many of them low- to midlevel employees of Mar-a-Lago or the Trump Organization, the former president's family real estate business. Most of these people -- aides, assistants, housekeepers, security officials -- have been interviewed by Mr. Smith's team or appeared before grand juries.
Among them was Yuscil Taveras, who works for the Trump Organization in information technology and oversaw the surveillance cameras at Mar-a-Lago, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The indictment describes how in June 2022, on the same day that prosecutors issued a subpoena for footage from the cameras, Mr. Nauta and Mr. De Oliveira sent text messages to Mr. Taveras implying that they needed to speak with him.
A few days later, Mr. De Oliveira approached Mr. Taveras in Mar-a-Lago's I.T. department and brought him to a private room for a conversation meant to "remain between the two of them."
There, the indictment said, Mr. De Oliveira told Mr. Taveras that the "'boss' wanted the server deleted" -- a reference to the computer server housing the footage. When Mr. Taveras responded that he did not know how to delete the server and did not think he had the rights to do so, Mr. De Oliveira repeated the orders from "the boss," according to the indictment. "What are we going to do?" Mr. De Oliveira asked.
Mr. Taveras, identified in the indictment as Trump Employee 4, provided the outlines of that encounter to the grand jury in May, the people with knowledge of the matter said. During Mr. Taveras's grand jury testimony, prosecutors questioned him about his dealings with Mr. Nauta and Mr. De Oliveira, the people said, seemingly laying the groundwork for the indictment that was unsealed last week.
The Trump Organization ultimately turned over the surveillance tapes, and the indictment does not accuse any Mar-a-Lago employees of destroying the footage. (Mr. Taveras has not been accused of any wrongdoing. Although at one point Mr. Smith's team was scrutinizing other aspects of his grand jury testimony, there is no indication he is facing legal jeopardy.)
At a trial, Mr. Taveras's testimony could be crucial for Mr. Smith's prosecutors in establishing a conspiracy to try to erase the tapes -- and thus obstruct the investigation. And yet Mr. Taveras remains a Mar-a-Lago employee, one person with knowledge of the matter said. He has a new lawyer, and it is unclear who is paying his legal bills.
In a remarkable scene in the indictment, people in Mr. Trump's orbit are described as beginning to worry about Mr. De Oliveira's loyalties after the F.B.I. descended on Mar-a-Lago with a search warrant last summer and hauled away about 100 classified documents.
"Someone just wants to make sure Carlos is good," the indictment quoted Mr. Nauta as saying to another Trump employee.
In response, that employee wrote in a Signal message with Mr. Nauta and Ms. Wiles that Mr. De Oliveira was "loyal," according to prosecutors. It was unclear what, if anything, was said by others in the group message.
That same day, the indictment said, Mr. Trump called Mr. De Oliveira and said he would get him a lawyer.

IRVINE, Calif. — On a Thursday evening in late June, Clarissa Champlain learned that her 15-year-old son Brodee had been in a terrible crash, the latest teen victim of an e-bike accident.
He had been riding from home to shot-putting practice. The e-bike, a model made by Rad Power, had a top speed of 20 mph, but his route took him on a busy road with a 55 mph limit. While turning left, he was clipped by a Nissan van and thrown violently.
Champlain rushed to the hospital and was taken to Brodee’s room. She could see the marks left by the chin strap of his bike helmet. “I went to grab his head and kiss him,” she recalled. “But there was no back of his head. It wasn’t the skull, it was just mush.”
Three days later, another teenage boy was taken to the same hospital after the e-bike he was riding collided with a car, leaving him sprawled beneath a BMW, hurt but alive. According to police, the teen had been seen driving recklessly and was found to be at fault. In the days following, the town of Encinitas, California, where both incidents occurred, declared a state of emergency for e-bike safety.
The e-bike industry is booming, but summer 2023 has brought sharp questions about how safe e-bikes are, especially for teenagers. Many e-bikes can exceed the 20 mph speed limit that is legal for teenagers in most states; some can exceed 55 mph. But even when ridden at legal speeds, there are risks, especially for young, inexperienced riders merging into complex traffic with fast-moving cars and sometimes distracted drivers.
“The speed they are going is too fast for sidewalks, but it’s too slow to be in traffic,” said Jeremy Collis, a sergeant at the North Coastal Station of the San Diego County Sheriff’s Office, which is investigating the fatal accident involving Brodee. The investigation is ongoing pending a medical examiner’s finding.
To some policymakers and law enforcement officials, the technology has far outpaced existing laws, regulations and safety guidelines. Police and industry officials charge that some companies appear to knowingly sell products that can easily evade speed limits and endanger young riders.
“It’s not like a bicycle,” Collis said. “But the laws are treating it like any bicycle.”
Two federal agencies, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said they were evaluating “how best to oversee the safety of e-bikes,” according to a statement provided by the highway safety agency.
Communities have begun to alert their residents to the dangers of e-bikes. In June, the police department in Bend, Oregon, ran a public service campaign acquainting the public with the e-bike laws that were frequently being broken there. Days later, a 15-year-old boy was killed when the e-bike he was riding was struck by a van; the driver has not been cited or charged.
Sheila Miller, who is the spokesperson for Bend police and helped develop the public service campaign, emphasized that not everything that calls itself an e-bike qualifies as one, or is safe or legal for minors. Under Oregon law, which is more restrictive than those in most states, a person must be at least 16 to ride an e-bike of any kind.
“Parents, please don’t buy these bikes for kids when they are not legally allowed to ride them,” Miller said. “And if you own an e-bike, make sure that everyone who is using them knows the rules of the road.”
Booming Industry, Modest Regulation
The typical e-bike has functioning pedals as well as a motor that is recharged with an electrical cord; the pedals and the motor can be used individually or simultaneously. Unlike a combustion engine, an electric motor can accelerate instantly, which makes e-bikes appealing to ride.
E-bikes are also seen as vital in shifting the transportation system away from emission-spewing cars and the congestion they create, said Rachel Hultin, policy and governmental affairs director for Bicycle Colorado, a nonprofit advocacy group for bicycle safety and policy. E-bikes and electric scooters are part of the so-called micromobility movement, propelling commuters and other people short distances across crowded spaces.
The number of e-bikes being sold is unclear because, like regular bikes, they do not need to be registered with the government. (Cars, motorcycles and mopeds must be registered through a state’s Department of Motor Vehicles.)
Many are sold directly to consumers over the internet, rather than through physical retailers that often track sales. John MacArthur, an e-bike industry expert with the Transportation Research and Education Center at Portland State University, estimated that roughly 1 million e-bikes would be sold in the United States this year.
The minimal regulation around e-bikes is a selling point for the industry. Super73, a company in Irvine, California, that makes popular models, advertises on its website: “RIDE WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS . No license, registration, or insurance required.”
“It’s one of the very unique categories of vehicle that there really isn’t any kind of onerous regulation,” a company co-founder, LeGrand Crewse, said in an interview, noting that helmet requirements were also modest, depending on the state and the rider’s age.
Law enforcement officials have begun to express concerns about the minimal training required of teenage e-bike owners, and about their behavior. Car drivers ages 16 to 19 are three times as likely to be killed in a crash as drivers 20 or older, and bicyclists ages 10 to 24 have the highest rate of emergency room visits for crashes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some states have begun to raise training requirements for young drivers, including adding graduated license programs that require extended hours of supervised driving, limiting night driving or restricting the number or age of passengers.
The California Legislature is considering a bill that would prohibit e-bike use by people younger than 12 and “state the intent of the Legislature to create an e-bike license program with an online written test and a state-issued photo identification for those persons without a valid driver’s license.”
“I know the e-bike situation is evolving,” said Collis of the San Diego County Sheriff’s Office. “But personally, with all these bikes, you should have at least a permit or a license to ride them at the speed they’re going.”
As a transportation solution, e-bikes seem promising. “I’m really bullish about middle and high schoolers being able to use e-bikes,” said Hultin of Bicycle Colorado. She noted that e-bikes offered children and busy families more transportation options at lower cost. But she worried that the vehicles could lead to an unsafe mix of untrained e-cyclists and unaware car drivers.
That problem, Hultin said, was exacerbated by “an algae bloom of noncompliant e-bikes.” She was referring to products on the market that call themselves e-bikes but are not, either because they can go faster than allowed by law or because, once purchased, they can be modified to do so.
One vehicle that has drawn attention for its speed is made by Sur-Ron, whose products have been involved in several recent deaths. In June in Cardiff, Wales, two boys on a Sur-ron bike died in a crash while being followed by police; days earlier, a boy riding a Sur-ron in Greater Manchester had died after colliding with an ambulance.
In its marketing materials, Sur-Ron describes one model, the Light Bee Electric Bike, as “easy to maneuver like a bicycle, with the torque and power of an off-road motorcycle.” Its operating manual cautions the owner to “please follow the traffic rules and with the safe speed (the top speed for this electric vehicle is 20 km/h).”
But the speed restraint — equivalent to about 12 mph — can be removed by simply clipping a wire, a procedure that is widely shared in online videos, and which law enforcement officials said appeared to be there by design.
“There are all kinds of videos on how to jailbreak your Sur-ron,” said Capt. Christopher McDonald of the Sheriff’s Department in Orange County, California, where e-bike accidents and injuries are rising. With the speed wire clipped, the vehicle can approach 70 mph, he said. Several requests for comment were sent through the Sur-ron website but did not receive a response.
Matt Moore, general counsel for PeopleForBikes, the main trade group for bicycles and e-bikes, said he worried about products such as Sur-ron’s. “Some products are sold as ostensibly compliant but are easily modified by the user with the knowledge and presumably the blessing of the manufacturer,” he said. “Unfortunately, there appears to be a lack of resources at the federal level to investigate and address e-mobility products that may actually be motor vehicles.”
Tragedy in Encinitas
The day after Brodee entered the hospital, his family sat at his bedside. They played his favorite music, including Kendrick Lamar and early Wu-Tang Clan. “I read to him for hours,” his mother said. “We wanted to wake up his brain.”
Three days later, as Brodee clung to life, Niko Sougias, owner of Charlie’s Electric Bike, a popular e-bike shop in town, was driving in Encinitas on Highway 101 when he saw two teenage boys riding Sur-rons in the opposite direction.
“They were doing wheelies,” Sougias said. He has grown concerned about the e-bike industry, he said, and does not sell many models that are popular with teenagers.
His route that Saturday followed the path of the boys on the Sur-rons. Moments later, after a turn, Sougias saw that one of the Sur-ron riders had collided with an SUV, had been thrown from his bike and was under a BMW. “He was lucky to escape with his life,” Sougias said.
Champlain was at the hospital with Brodee when the boy who had been riding the Sur-ron was brought in. Paramedics stopped by Brodee’s room to check in. “I can’t believe I’m here again for this,” she said one of them had told her; the same paramedic had brought in Brodee by ambulance.
Hours later, Brodee was pronounced dead. He was a beloved young man with a bright future. He was fluent in Spanish and had a college-level knowledge of Japanese; he could dead-lift 300 pounds and, in 2020, was named student of the year at his high school. “I had so many people call me to tell me they’d lost their best friend,” his mother said.
Champlain said witnesses had told her that her son “did everything right,” including signaling to make a left turn.
“There should be more education for drivers with the change that’s happened,” she said. “I’d never seen an e-bike on the road until three years ago. Now I see hundreds.”
“They’re treated like bicycles when they’re not. They’re not equal.”

In the early 2000s, Carlos De Oliveira was a valet and handyman at Mar-a-Lago, parking cars and doing odd jobs at Donald Trump’s private club and residence in Florida for not much more than $10,000 a year, court records show.
Then, within two months in 2012, De Oliveira divorced and filed for bankruptcy. He owned a 6-year-old BMW that needed brake work, paint and its belts replaced. His checking account, records said, held $700.
But over a decade, De Oliveira, a Portuguese immigrant, started slowly climbing a ladder of promotions at Mar-a-Lago. First, Trump brought him on to the maintenance staff full-time, according to a person familiar with the matter. Early last year, he was given the loftier post of Mar-a-Lago’s property manager.
That was the job he held when he was named with Trump in a new indictment last week, one that accused him of conspiring with the former president and one of his personal aides to obstruct the government’s efforts to retrieve dozens of highly sensitive national security documents from Trump after he left office.
De Oliveira, a minor player in the case, was ensnared in it largely because prosecutors contend he delivered a message to another Trump employee that the former president wanted to delete a trove of potentially incriminating surveillance footage at Mar-a-Lago. He was also charged with lying to investigators.
The path he followed is a familiar one in the world of Trump, who often views relationships in terms of leverage and obsesses constantly about loyalty. In his business career, as a candidate and as president, Trump has frequently plucked subordinates from trouble or obscurity and given them a lifeline — and, by extension, a sense of obligation to him.
Those opportunities and obligations have sometimes come with a cost — including, as in the case of De Oliveira, serious legal jeopardy.
The release of new details Thursday in an updated indictment by the special counsel, Jack Smith, underscored the extent to which low-level workers like De Oliveira — lacking Trump’s reserves of power, fame and money — have become embroiled in the government’s attempts to hold the former president accountable for threatening national security.
The situation is even more extraordinary because De Oliveira and Trump’s other co-defendant in the case, Walt Nauta, his personal aide, are relying on the former president not only for their paychecks but also their legal bills. Those are being handled by Save America PAC, one of Trump’s fundraising entities.
In a statement sent after this article was published online, Steven Cheung, a spokesperson for Trump, criticized the Justice Department.
“For the weaponized Department of Justice and the deranged Jack Smith to target innocent individuals and everyday Americans by leaking false and misleading information, which is illegal and unethical, shows just how desperate and flailing they are in order to salvage their collapsing case,” he said. Cheung appeared to be referring to the details of the indictment.
“President Trump’s employees are honorable, hard workers, and are the best of the best,” he added. “They don’t violate the law because they are law-abiding citizens.”
The payment of the legal bills has been the responsibility of Susie Wiles, one of Trump’s top political advisers.
She started by signing off on checks from the political action committee to lawyers for some of the former White House and campaign officials who received subpoenas in the past two years from the House select committee investigating Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election. As the criminal investigations have unfolded, the number of lawyers whose payments Wiles is responsible for has grown.
Wiles also made an appearance in another portion of the indictment, where prosecutors described Trump showing a classified document to a representative of a political action committee — identified by people familiar with the matter as Wiles.
With so much of Trump’s past fundraising spent on voluminous legal expenses, two people familiar with the matter said his advisers were creating a legal-defense fund to take on some of the costs, although the fund is not expected to cover the former president’s legal fees. It is unclear how many other people the fund is intended to support. Trump’s advisers have insisted there has been no effort to influence witness testimony through Save America’s payment of legal fees.
While Trump plays the leading role in the indictment in the documents case, the narrative as laid out by Smith’s team relies heavily on supporting characters like De Oliveira, Nauta and others.
Much of the story involves what prosecutors have said was a plot to move boxes of documents in and out of a storage room at Mar-a-Lago to avoid returning them to the government. Prosecutors say there was also a subsequent attempt to disguise those movements by seeking to delete footage from security cameras positioned outside the storage room.
According to the indictment, Nauta was central to the first part of the scheme, moving boxes from the room at least five times at Trump’s direction. All of that took place during a critical moment in the government’s investigation: the weeks between the issuance of a subpoena last year demanding the return of all classified documents in Trump’s possession and a visit to Mar-a-Lago shortly after by prosecutors seeking to collect the materials.
Nauta’s path to Trump and Mar-a-Lago was also characterized by a degree of turbulence.

The indictment describes how in June 2022, on the same day that prosecutors issued a subpoena for footage from the cameras, Nauta and De Oliveira sent text messages to Taveras implying that they needed to speak with him.

IRVINE, Calif. — On a Thursday evening in late June, Clarissa Champlain learned that her 15-year-old son Brodee had been in a terrible crash, the latest teen victim of an e-bike accident.
He had been riding from home to shot-putting practice. The e-bike, a model made by Rad Power, had a top speed of 20 mph, but his route took him on a busy road with a 55 mph. While turning left, he was clipped by a Nissan van and thrown violently.
Champlain rushed to the hospital and was taken to Brodee’s room. She could see the marks left by the chin strap of his bike helmet. “I went to grab his head and kiss him,” she recalled. “But there was no back of his head. It wasn’t the skull, it was just mush.”
Three days later, another teenage boy was taken to the same hospital after the e-bike he was riding collided with a car, leaving him sprawled beneath a BMW, hurt but alive. According to police, the teen had been seen driving recklessly and was found to be at fault. In the days following, the town of Encinitas, California, where both incidents occurred, declared a state of emergency for e-bike safety.
The e-bike industry is booming, but summer 2023 has brought sharp questions about how safe e-bikes are, especially for teenagers. Many e-bikes can exceed the 20 mph speed limit that is legal for teenagers in most states; some can go 70 mph. But even when ridden at legal speeds, there are risks, especially for young, inexperienced riders merging into complex traffic with fast-moving cars and sometimes distracted drivers.
“The speed they are going is too fast for sidewalks, but it’s too slow to be in traffic,” said Jeremy Collis, a sergeant at the North Coastal Station of the San Diego County Sheriff’s Office, which is investigating the fatal accident involving Brodee. The investigation is ongoing pending a medical examiner’s finding.
To some policymakers and law enforcement officials, the technology has far outpaced existing laws, regulations and safety guidelines. Police and industry officials charge that some companies appear to knowingly sell products that can easily evade speed limits and endanger young riders.
“It’s not like a bicycle,” Collis said. “But the laws are treating it like any bicycle.”
Two federal agencies, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said they were evaluating “how best to oversee the safety of e-bikes,” according to a statement provided by the highway safety agency.
Communities have begun to alert their residents to the dangers of e-bikes. In June, the police department in Bend, Oregon, ran a public service campaign acquainting the public with the e-bike laws that were frequently being broken there. Days later, a 15-year-old boy was killed when the e-bike he was riding was struck by a van; the driver has not been cited or charged.
Sheila Miller, who is the spokesperson for Bend police and helped develop the public service campaign, emphasized that not everything that calls itself an e-bike qualifies as one, or is safe or legal for minors. Under Oregon law, which is more restrictive than those in most states, a person must be at least 16 to ride an e-bike of any kind.
“Parents, please don’t buy these bikes for kids when they are not legally allowed to ride them,” Miller said. “And if you own an e-bike, make sure that everyone who is using them knows the rules of the road.”
Booming Industry, Modest Regulation
The typical e-bike has functioning pedals as well as a motor that is recharged with an electrical cord; the pedals and the motor can be used individually or simultaneously. Unlike a combustion engine, an electric motor can accelerate instantly, which makes e-bikes appealing to ride.
E-bikes are also seen as vital in shifting the transportation system away from emission-spewing cars and the congestion they create, said Rachel Hultin, policy and governmental affairs director for Bicycle Colorado, a nonprofit advocacy group for bicycle safety and policy. E-bikes and electric scooters are part of the so-called micromobility movement, propelling commuters and other people short distances across crowded spaces.
The number of e-bikes being sold is unclear because, like regular bikes, they do not need to be registered with the government. (Cars, motorcycles and mopeds must be registered through a state’s Department of Motor Vehicles.)
Many are sold directly to consumers over the internet, rather than through physical retailers that often track sales. John MacArthur, an e-bike industry expert with the Transportation Research and Education Center at Portland State University, estimated that roughly 1 million e-bikes would be sold in the United States this year.
The minimal regulation around e-bikes is a selling point for the industry. Super73, a company in Irvine, California, that makes popular models, advertises on its website: “RIDE WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS . No license, registration, or insurance required.”
“It’s one of the very unique categories of vehicle that there really isn’t any kind of onerous regulation,” a company co-founder, LeGrand Crewse, said in an interview, noting that helmet requirements were also modest, depending on the state and the rider’s age.
Law enforcement officials have begun to express concerns about the minimal training required of teenage e-bike owners, and about their behavior. Car drivers ages 16 to 19 are three times as likely to be killed in a crash as drivers 20 or older, and bicyclists ages 10 to 24 have the highest rate of emergency room visits for crashes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some states have begun to raise training requirements for young drivers, including adding graduated license programs that require extended hours of supervised driving, limiting night driving or restricting the number or age of passengers.
The California Legislature is considering a bill that would prohibit e-bike use by people younger than 12 and “state the intent of the Legislature to create an e-bike license program with an online written test and a state-issued photo identification for those persons without a valid driver’s license.”
“I know the e-bike situation is evolving,” said Collis of the San Diego County Sheriff’s Office. “But personally, with all these bikes, you should have at least a permit or a license to ride them at the speed they’re going.”
As a transportation solution, e-bikes seem promising. “I’m really bullish about middle and high schoolers being able to use e-bikes,” said Hultin of Bicycle Colorado. She noted that e-bikes offered children and busy families more transportation options at lower cost. But she worried that the vehicles could lead to an unsafe mix of untrained e-cyclists and unaware car drivers.
That problem, Hultin said, was exacerbated by “an algae bloom of noncompliant e-bikes.” She was referring to products on the market that call themselves e-bikes but are not, either because they can go faster than allowed by law or because, once purchased, they can be modified to do so.
One vehicle that has drawn attention for its speed is made by Sur-Ron, whose products have been involved in several recent deaths. In June in Cardiff, Wales, two boys on a Sur-ron bike died in a crash while being followed by police; days earlier, a boy riding a Sur-ron in Greater Manchester had died after colliding with an ambulance.
In its marketing materials, Sur-Ron describes one model, the Light Bee Electric Bike, as “easy to maneuver like a bicycle, with the torque and power of an off-road motorcycle.” Its operating manual cautions the owner to “please follow the traffic rules and with the safe speed (the top speed for this electric vehicle is 20 km/h).”
But the speed restraint — equivalent to about 12 mph — can be removed by simply clipping a wire, a procedure that is widely shared in online videos, and which law enforcement officials said appeared to be there by design.
“There are all kinds of videos on how to jailbreak your Sur-ron,” said Capt. Christopher McDonald of the Sheriff’s Department in Orange County, California, where e-bike accidents and injuries are rising. With the speed wire clipped, the vehicle can approach 70 mph, he said. Several requests for comment were sent through the Sur-ron website but did not receive a response.
Matt Moore, general counsel for PeopleForBikes, the main trade group for bicycles and e-bikes, said he worried about products such as Sur-ron’s. “Some products are sold as ostensibly compliant but are easily modified by the user with the knowledge and presumably the blessing of the manufacturer,” he said. “Unfortunately, there appears to be a lack of resources at the federal level to investigate and address e-mobility products that may actually be motor vehicles.”
Tragedy in Encinitas
The day after Brodee entered the hospital, his family sat at his bedside. They played his favorite music, including Kendrick Lamar and early Wu-Tang Clan. “I read to him for hours,” his mother said. “We wanted to wake up his brain.”
Three days later, as Brodee clung to life, Niko Sougias, owner of Charlie’s Electric Bike, a popular e-bike shop in town, was driving in Encinitas on Highway 101 when he saw two teenage boys riding Sur-rons in the opposite direction.
“They were doing wheelies,” Sougias said. He has grown concerned about the e-bike industry, he said, and does not sell many models that are popular with teenagers.
His route that Saturday followed the path of the boys on the Sur-rons. Moments later, after a turn, Sougias saw that one of the Sur-ron riders had collided with an SUV, had been thrown from his bike and was under a BMW. “He was lucky to escape with his life,” Sougias said.
Champlain was at the hospital with Brodee when the boy who had been riding the Sur-ron was brought in. Paramedics stopped by Brodee’s room to check in. “I can’t believe I’m here again for this,” she said one of them had told her; the same paramedic had brought in Brodee by ambulance.
Hours later, Brodee was pronounced dead. He was a beloved young man with a bright future. He was fluent in Spanish and had a college-level knowledge of Japanese; he could dead-lift 300 pounds and, in 2020, was named student of the year at his high school. “I had so many people call me to tell me they’d lost their best friend,” his mother said.
Champlain said witnesses had told her that her son “did everything right,” including signaling to make a left turn.
“There should be more education for drivers with the change that’s happened,” she said. “I’d never seen an e-bike on the road until three years ago. Now I see hundreds.”
“They’re treated like bicycles when they’re not. They’re not equal.”

Full text: Out on the road with nowhere to plug in -- that's the greatest fear of many would-be electric vehicle buyers and why they're staying on the sidelines. And that's why a group of automakers is planning to build 30,000 fast charging points in North America.
The joint venture by seven carmakers -- BMW, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis -- would nearly double the number of fast chargers in the United States. Those chargers can replenish a drained battery in 10 to 30 minutes.
While most E.V. owners typically charge their vehicles at home overnight, they need fast charging stations for longer trips. But the chargers can be far-flung in sparsely populated areas.
At the moment, Tesla accounts for more than half the fast chargers in the United States. Last month, Ford Motor and G.M. struck a deal that would allow them to adopt Tesla's charging technology, and separately Tesla has pledged to make more of its chargers available to other car brands. The collaboration announced on Wednesday would give the automakers an option other than Tesla for charging.
Installing so many charging stations will be costly -- $ 1 billion -- and will take until the end of the decade to complete, though some chargers will be in place around the middle of next year.
But major carmakers have already invested billions to produce electric vehicles and want to ensure that the vehicles catch on. Shoring up charging infrastructure may be a necessary to getting car buyers over a major psychological hurdle.
"The better experience people have, the faster E.V. adoption will grow," said Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of G.M.
"We have to be ready to follow the data, and given how far we've come, we can afford to be a little patient as well as resolute as we let this unfold."

Full text: The companies will jointly spend at least $ 1 billion to build a North American network in an effort to persuade more people to buy battery-powered cars and trucks.
Seven major automakers announced a plan on Wednesday to nearly double the number of fast chargers in the United States in an effort to address one of the main reasons that people hesitate to buy electric cars.
The carmakers -- BMW Group, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz Group and Stellantis -- will initially invest at least $ 1 billion in a joint venture that will build 30,000 charging ports on major highways and other locations in the United States and Canada.
The United States and Canada have about 36,000 fast chargers -- those that can replenish a drained battery in 30 minutes or less. In some sparsely populated areas, such chargers can be hundreds of miles apart. Surveys show that fear about not being able to find a charger during longer journeys is a major reason that some car buyers are reluctant to buy electric vehicles.
Sales of electric vehicles have risen quickly in the United States, but there are signs that demand is softening. As a result, Tesla, Ford Motor and other carmakers have cut prices in recent months and are offering incentives. Popular models that had long waiting lists last year are now available in a few days or weeks.
Major carmakers are investing billions of dollars to manufacture electric vehicles and batteries and to establish supplier networks. Having staked their futures on the technology, they have a strong incentive to ensure that electric vehicles catch on with car buyers.
The chargers installed by the joint venture will have plugs designed for the connections used by most carmakers other than Tesla, as well as the standard developed by Tesla that Ford, G.M. and other companies have said they intend to switch to in 2025.
"The better experience people have, the faster E.V. adoption will grow," Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, said in a statement.
The seven automakers plan to formalize the joint venture and announce its name by the end of the year, Chris Martin, a Honda spokesman, said. The first chargers will begin operating around the middle of 2024, he said, with all 30,000 in place by the end of the decade.
The joint venture is open to adding other partners, he said. Among major automakers, Ford was a notable absence from the announcement on Wednesday. The company said in a statement on Wednesday that it would continue to invest in its own network, which allows Ford owners to charge from a variety of providers with one mobile phone app.
The partnership also does not include Volkswagen. The company is a majority shareholder of Electrify America, one of the largest fast-charging providers.
Tesla accounts for more than half the fast chargers in the United States and has said it will open its networks to other car brands, though, so far, it has made fewer than 100 ports available. Owners of Ford and G.M. vehicles, among others, will be able to connect to 12,000 Tesla fast chargers using an adapter beginning next year. In 2025, Ford and G.M. plan to make models designed to take the Tesla plug without an adapter.
The decision to form the joint venture is an indication that the seven carmakers do not intend to rely solely on Tesla, which dominates sales of electric vehicles, for charging.
The chargers being built by the joint venture will be concentrated in urban areas and along major highways, especially those used most heavily by vacationers and other travelers, the companies said in a statement. Charging stations will be close to restrooms, restaurants and other amenities. The partners said they would try to take advantage of federal and state funds available for charging infrastructure.
Most electric vehicle owners charge at home and rarely need to use public chargers. Home chargers typically replenish batteries overnight. Most public chargers, about 125,000 in the United States and Canada, also operate relatively slowly -- taking four to 10 hours to do the job.
But fast chargers are important for longer trips. Fear of not being able to find one is a major psychological impediment for many would-be electric car buyers. A related problem is that many charging companies have been reluctant to build too many stations in places where few people own electric cars.
The best way to promote electric vehicle ownership, said Shay Natarajan, a partner at Mobility Impact Partners, a private equity firm in New York that focuses on transportation, would be to install chargers in states in the West, Midwest or Southeast where there aren't many, rather than in California or Eastern states that already have extensive charging networks.
Studies have found that in Norway, where almost all new cars sold are battery-powered, sales of electric cars increased steeply when fast chargers became available, Ms. Natarajan said. But the impact diminished as chargers became more commonplace.
"In states where E.V. adoption is the lowest, that is where it would make sense to build chargers," she said. "That is where you are going to have the most impact."
But even California could use more charging stations, said Cathy Zoi, the chief executive of EVgo, a Los Angeles company that builds and operates public charging stations nationwide.
"The most mature market is California, and we're not saturated in California yet," Ms. Zoi said. "Potential buyers of E.V.s are still feeling they need to see more charging stations."
The new joint venture could be a competitor to EVgo, Electrify America and other companies hoping to cash in on the growth of electric vehicles. But the carmakers may also want to tap the expertise of EVgo and others that have experience in finding suitable sites, acquiring permits and connecting to the electric grid.
EVgo has a partnership with G.M. to build fast-charging stations, and Ms. Zoi said the company was open to working with the joint venture.
An Energy Department database that maps the location of chargers highlights the gaping holes in current networks. In Minnesota, for example, fast chargers are sprinkled across the bustling Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But in the state's northern city, Duluth, home to nearly 90,000 people, there are just five fast-charging ports, four of which can charge only Tesla cars.
Fast chargers are concentrated in wealthier counties, according to a study by Bumper, an online marketplace for cars. There are also racial disparities. Counties where most residents are Black have, on average, fewer than half as many chargers per capita as white counties, according to Bumper. Native American counties have even fewer.

Fast chargers are concentrated in wealthier counties, according to a study by Bumper, an online marketplace for cars. There are also racial disparities. Counties where most residents are Black have, on average, fewer than half as many chargers per capita as white counties, according to Bumper. Native American counties have even fewer.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Republicans are raising fresh concerns about CATL, the battery maker Ford is working with to bring new technology to the U.S., and its connections to Xinjiang.
A licensing agreement between Ford Motor and a major Chinese battery maker is facing scrutiny by Republican lawmakers, who say it could make an American automaker reliant on a company with links to forced labor in China's Xinjiang region.
In a letter sent to Ford on Thursday, the chairs of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party and the House Ways and Means Committee demanded more information about the agreement, including what they said was a plan by Ford to employ several hundred workers from China at a new battery factory in Michigan.
Ford announced in February that it planned to set up the $ 3.5 billion factory using technology from Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd., known as CATL, the world's largest maker of batteries for electric vehicles. CATL produces about a third of electric vehicle batteries globally and supplies General Motors, Volkswagen, BMW, Tesla and other major automakers.
Ford has defended the collaboration, saying it will help diversify Ford's supply chain and allow a battery that is less expensive and more durable than current alternatives to be made in the United States for the first time, rather than imported.
But lawmakers, who previously criticized the agreement, cited evidence that CATL had not relinquished its ownership of a company it helped set up in Xinjiang, where the United Nations has identified systemic human rights violations.
CATL publicly divested its share of the company, Xinjiang Zhicun Lithium Industry Company, in March, after its deal with Ford was announced. But the shares were bought by an investment partnership in which CATL had owned a partial stake when it was established, as well as a former CATL manager who holds leadership roles in other companies owned by the battery maker, corporate records show.
The circumstances of the sale raise "serious questions about whether CATL is attempting to obscure links to forced labor," wrote Representatives Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, the chairman of the select committee, and Jason Smith of Missouri, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
The lawmakers, citing details of Ford's licensing agreement that are on file with the select committee, also criticized the automaker's commitment to employ several hundred Chinese workers. Employees from China would set up and maintain CATL's equipment at the Michigan factory until about 2038, the lawmakers said. The factory is expected to employ 2,500 U.S. workers, Ford has said.
"Ford has argued that the deal will create thousands of American jobs, further Ford's 'commitments to sustainability and human rights' and lead to American battery technology advancements," they wrote. "But newly discovered information raises serious questions about each claim."
T.R. Reid, a spokesman for Ford, said the company was going through the letter and would respond in good faith. He said that human rights were fundamental to how Ford did business, and that the automaker was thorough in assessing such issues.
"There has been an awful lot said and implied about this project that is incorrect," Mr. Reid said. "At the end of the day, we think creating 2,500 good-paying jobs with a new multibillion investment in the U.S. for great technology that we'll bring to bear in great electric vehicles is good all the way around."
CATL responded after publication saying that it has no equity relationship with the investment partnership that bought the Xinjiang company, but it did not immediately provide any documentation.
CATL's collaboration with Ford could be a bellwether for the electric vehicle industry in the United States. Critics have labeled the agreement a "Trojan horse" for Chinese interests and called for scuttling the partnership. If it succeeds, they say, reliance on Chinese technology could become the norm for the U.S. electric vehicle industry.
Ultimately, China's control over key technologies like batteries could leave the United States "in a far weaker position," said Erik Gordon, a clinical assistant professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.
"The profit margins go to the innovators who provide the advanced technology, not the people with screwdrivers that assemble the advanced technology," he said.
But CATL and other Chinese companies have battery technology not readily available from suppliers in the United States or Europe. The Michigan plant would be the first in the United States to produce so-called LFP batteries that use lithium, iron and phosphate as their main active materials.
They are heavier than the lithium, nickel and manganese batteries currently used by Ford and other automakers but less expensive to make and more durable, able to withstand numerous charges without degrading. They also do not use nickel or cobalt, another battery material, which are often mined in environmentally damaging ways, and sometimes with child labor.
Without the most advanced or least expensive batteries, U.S. carmakers could fall behind Chinese rivals like BYD that are pushing into Europe and other markets outside China. Americans may also have to pay more for electric cars and trucks, which would slow sales of vehicles that do not emit greenhouse gases.
A battery unveiled by CATL last year delivers hundreds of miles of driving range after a charge of just 10 minutes.
"The hard truth is that the Chinese took a huge gamble on electric vehicles and plopped down over a trillion Chinese dollars and subsidies on this industry, and it just so happens that gamble came up all aces," said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
"If you decide not to partner with a very large battery maker, then you're essentially committing to delaying the U.S. energy transition," he added.
Ford plans to use batteries made with CATL technology in lower-priced versions of vehicles like the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning pickup. The least expensive version of Tesla's Model 3 sedan comes with an LFP battery that CATL is widely reported to have supplied.
For decades, Western companies have had a monopoly on the world's most advanced technologies, and have sought access to the Chinese market while also safeguarding their intellectual property.
But China's dominance in electric vehicle batteries, as well as in the production of solar panels and wind turbines, has flipped that dynamic. It has created a particularly tricky dilemma for the Biden administration and other Democrats, who want to reduce the country's reliance on China but also argue that the United States must quickly make a transition to cleaner energy sources to try to mitigate climate change.
The solar and electric vehicle battery industry's exposure to Xinjiang further complicates the situation. The Biden administration has condemned the Chinese government for carrying out genocide and crimes against humanity in the region.
The United States last year barred imports of products made in whole or in part in Xinjiang, saying companies operating in the region are not able to ensure that their facilities are free of forced labor.
In 2022, CATL and a partner registered a lithium processing company in the region called Xinjiang Zhicun Lithium Industry Company, which promoted plans to become the world's largest producer of lithium carbonate, a key battery component.
Through a series of subsidiaries and shareholder relationships, that Xinjiang lithium company has financial ties to a Chinese electricity company, Tebian Electric Apparatus Stock Company, or TBEA, according to records that The New York Times reviewed through Sayari Graph, a mapping tool for corporate ownership. TBEA has participated extensively in so-called poverty alleviation and labor transfer programs in Xinjiang that the United States considers a form of forced labor.
While the Chinese government argues that labor transfer and poverty alleviation programs are aimed at improving living standards in the region, human rights experts say that they are also directed at pacifying and indoctrinating the population, and that Uyghurs and other minority groups there cannot say no to these programs without fear of detention or punishment.
In December, CATL told The Times that it was a minority shareholder in the Xinjiang company and strictly prohibited any form of forced labor in its supply chain.
The Republican lawmakers also raised concerns about whether batteries made at Ford's Michigan plant would qualify for tax credits that the Biden administration was offering consumers who bought electric vehicles as part of the Inflation Reduction Act.
The law prohibits "foreign entities of concern" -- like companies in China, Russia, Iran or North Korea -- from benefiting from government tax credits. But because Ford is licensing CATL technology for the plant -- rather than forming a joint venture, as has often been the case with automakers and battery suppliers -- the batteries made in Michigan may still qualify for those incentives.
The Biden administration has not yet clarified exactly how the restriction on foreign entities will be applied. But Ford officials said they had been in conversation with the administration about the Michigan plant, and were confident that the facility would qualify for all of the law's benefits.
"We think batteries built by American workers in an American plant run by the wholly owned subsidiary of an American company will and should qualify," Mr. Reid, the Ford spokesman, said.

Tesla Wants to Double the Size Of Its German Assembly Plant: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The electric automaker wants to produce a million cars a year at its plant near Berlin, a step that would make it Europe's largest car factory.
Tesla wants to double the production capacity of its assembly plant outside Berlin to one million electric vehicles a year, a move that would make it the largest car plant in Europe at a time when German automakers are struggling to keep pace in the transition to electric vehicles.
Since it began production in Grünheide 16 months ago, Tesla has disrupted the German automobile landscape. Over the first half of this year, for the first time, it eclipsed Volkswagen in electric vehicle sales.
If the expansion, detailed in thousands of pages made public on Wednesday, wins the approval of local officials, the plant's output will surpass that of Volkswagen's landmark factory in Wolfsburg, which was built in the 1930s and has remained Europe's largest, able to roll out 815,000 cars a year.
Volkswagen and other German automakers, including BMW and Mercedes-Benz, have spent years fumbling their attempts to produce electric cars that can compete with Tesla in price and popularity. Across the continent in June, new registrations of electric cars increased more than 66 percent from a year earlier, outselling diesel cars for the first time, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.
Since March 2022, Tesla's German plant has been producing about 5,000 Model Y sport utility vehicles each week -- a pace that is roughly half of its current capacity, which is still ramping up. The company said it would like to add capacity to build other models at the plant, but did not specify which ones. It is also seeking to double its production of battery cells, up to a storage capacity of 100 gigawatt hours per year, the expansion documents show.
The number of employees would rise to 22,500, up from 10,000 now, the company told residents at a town hall-style event near the plant on Tuesday. Dozens of jobs are advertised on the company's website, the majority of them in manufacturing, indicating the company still has openings in the current plant.
Dirk Schulze, the regional head of the IG Metall labor union, which counts 2.3 million workers nationwide among its ranks, welcomed the announcement of more jobs in the economically weak region. But he called for better working conditions for those on the job.
"Despite high levels of sick leave, staff are being cut on a significant scale," Mr. Schulze said. "But production targets are not being adjusted downward, so pressure on the remaining colleagues is increasing."
IG Metall has been frustrated at its inability to attract enough workers to produce a collective-bargaining agreement for employees at the plant. Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, has been blunt about his opposition to unions.
Local residents and organizations have one month to examine the plans and submit any concerns to authorities. A public hearing is to be held in October.
Tesla has encountered resistance from residents in the area since the plant was first proposed in 2019; they are concerned that the existing factory will be a drain on the groundwater. The expansion plans include construction of a water treatment facility, which would allow the factory to recycle water instead of expanding its use of resources.

E.V. Prices Fall as Automakers Raise Production: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Ford, Tesla and other automakers are having to lower prices to lure buyers as the supply of battery-powered models begins to exceed demand.
After struggling to find enough batteries and other parts for the past couple of years, automakers are finally beginning to churn out large numbers of electric cars and trucks. More than 30 new models will arrive in showrooms this year.
What they need now are more customers.
While sales of electric vehicles are increasing -- they climbed about 48 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier -- they are not rising fast enough to keep pace with the number of vehicles rolling off assembly lines. And inventories of unsold vehicles are starting to pile up.
More than 90,000 battery-powered cars and trucks are sitting on dealer lots, four times as many as a year ago, according to Cox Automotive, a market research firm. That's enough to last 103 days at the current rate of sales, compared with about 50 days for the industry as a whole.
Manufacturers "are having a 'Field of Dreams' moment," said Jonathan Gregory, a senior manager of economic and industry insight at Cox. "They have built E.V. inventory, but now they wait for buyers to come."
In view of this unbalanced supply and demand, automakers are cutting prices and offering more incentives. On Monday, Ford Motor reduced prices of its F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck by $ 6,000 to nearly $ 10,000, or as much as 17 percent on some versions. The company is also offering discounted interest rates of 1.9 percent to 3.9 percent on certain loans for Lightning purchases.
These moves follow several rounds of price cuts by Tesla, the dominant seller of electric cars. Tesla's price reductions earlier prompted Ford to lower prices of its Mustang Mach-E electric sport utility vehicle, although that hasn't brought Mach-E inventory back in line with sales.
At the end of June, Ford dealers had 16,400 of that model in stock -- about 2,000 more than they sold in the first six months of the year.
While many consumers express interest in electric vehicles, they are often not ready to go through with a purchase. Many people have been put off by high prices of electric cars and are waiting for them to cost no more than comparable gasoline models -- something that could be hastened by recent price cuts.
Other car buyers have concerns about how far these cars and trucks can travel on a full charge. Many models now available need to be recharged after traveling 200 to 250 miles. Uncertainty about finding charging stations and how long it takes to charge the vehicles can put off some people.
Glenn Staub, a personal trainer from White Plains, N.Y., said he wanted to buy a hybrid or fully electric car because of the potential environmental benefits and the savings on fuel costs. But he's not going to be in the market until his 2014 Toyota Corolla conks out.
"My policy for keeping cars is I drive it until it's not serviceable anymore," he said. That might not be for a few years; his Corolla has been driven just under 100,000 miles and runs fine.
Sales have become particularly sluggish for high-priced luxury models -- a segment of the market that has a surfeit of options from the likes of Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Porsche and Lucid Motors. Many of these cars cost $ 75,000 to $ 160,000.
"I think there was a lot of hype about E.V.s, and people did their research and realized these are premium vehicles and they're not cheap," said Rick Ricart, president of Ricart Automotive, which owns nine new-car franchises in Dublin, Ohio. "And there's been some pullback."
Mr. Ricart said his family's Ford store had a top-of-the-line F-150 Lightning Platinum truck on sale for $ 92,000 for more than two months. "A year ago, it would have been sold by now," he said.
Another group of electric vehicles that are struggling to find buyers are those that no longer qualify for a $ 7,500 federal tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden's ambitious climate change law. The credit is available only on cars that are assembled in North America and that include a certain percentage of battery materials from the region or from U.S. trade partners.
In addition to those restrictions, electric sedans have to sell for $ 55,000 or less to be eligible for credits, and S.U.V.s, pickup trucks and vans have to sell for $ 80,000 or less.
Purchases of Ford's Lightning trucks can make buyers eligible for the $ 7,500 credit, and the company is planning to sell a lot more of the pickups in the coming months. The company temporarily halted production this year to upgrade its assembly line and increase output. By the fall, the company expects its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center near Detroit to be able to churn out 150,000 Lightnings a year, triple its current production capacity.
The company's decision to lower prices may also have something to do with the growing competition in the electric vehicle business. Tesla said on Saturday that it had started producing its much-delayed Cybertruck pickup, and General Motors is expected to soon begin delivering an electric version of the Chevrolet Silverado truck.
Ford began making the Lightning in spring 2022 and raised prices several times by a total of around $ 20,000, citing increasing cost of raw materials for its batteries. At the time, demand far outstripped Ford's production, and some dealers were charging thousands of dollars more than the company's suggested retail price.
"Shortly after launching the F-150 Lightning, rapidly rising material costs, supply constraints and other factors drove up the cost of the E.V. truck for Ford and our customers," Marin Gjaja, the chief customer officer for the automaker's electric vehicle division, said in a statement. "We've continued to work in the background to improve accessibility to help lower prices for our customers and shorten wait times."
The company's decision to cut prices unnerved investors who feared it would hurt Ford's profits, and its stock price fell 6 percent on Monday.
Ford said the Pro model of the F-150 Lightning now had a list price of $ 49,995, a reduction of $ 9,979. The XLT 312A model with an extended range battery was cut $ 8,879, to $ 69,995. The top-of-the-line Platinum extended-range model will sell for $ 91,995, or $ 6,079 less than its price last week.
As a result of price cuts, most Lightning models will cost less than $ 80,000, making them eligible for a $ 7,500 federal tax credit.

Ford began making the Lightning in spring 2022 and raised prices several times by a total of around $20,000, citing increasing cost of raw materials for its batteries. At the time, demand far outstripped Ford’s production, and some dealers were charging thousands of dollars more than the company’s suggested retail price.
“Shortly after launching the F-150 Lightning, rapidly rising material costs, supply constraints and other factors drove up the cost of the EV truck for Ford and our customers,” Marin Gjaja, the chief customer officer for the automaker’s electric vehicle division, said in a statement. “We’ve continued to work in the background to improve accessibility to help lower prices for our customers and shorten wait times.”
Ford’s decision to cut prices unnerved investors who feared it would hurt profits, and its stock price fell 6% on Monday.
Ford said the Pro model of the F-150 Lightning now had a list price of $49,995, a reduction of $9,979. The XLT 312A model with an extended range battery was cut $8,879, to $69,995. The top-of-the-line Platinum extended-range model will sell for $91,995, or $6,079 less than its price last week.
As a result of price cuts, most Lightning models will cost less than $80,000, making them eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit.

Full text: Sudden, torrential rains struck areas in Bucks County, Pa., trapping people in their cars. Much of the Northeast was experiencing periods of heavy rainfall.
Fierce thunderstorms, heavy rainfall and flash flooding wreaked havoc across the Northeast over the weekend, killing five people in Pennsylvania, halting flights at major airports in the New York metropolitan area and downing power lines. In one part of Long Island, five inches of rain fell in less than two hours.
"We are in a very, very unstable weather condition," said that state's governor, Kathy Hochul, as she warned of the dangers of driving under flash flooding conditions. "Your car can go from a place of safety to a place of death."
The worst of the toll was in the suburbs north of Philadelphia, in the area of Washington Crossing -- famous as the location where George Washington crossed the Delaware River in 1776. A raging stream of floodwater trapped 11 cars Saturday evening, sweeping three of them away.
The authorities said a family visiting from Charleston, S.C., encountered the severe flash flooding along Washington Crossing Road, as they headed to a barbecue.
At a news briefing on Sunday, Tim Brewer, the fire chief of nearby Upper Makefield Township, said the family had tried to escape the fierce floodwaters, with the father clutching the 4-year-old son, as the mother and grandmother grabbed the two additional children, who were 9 months and 2 years old.
The father and son made it out safely, he said, but the grandmother, mother and the two children were swept away by the floodwaters.
As of Sunday afternoon, Pennsylvania officials were still searching for the two children, but officials said the mother was among five people confirmed dead. The grandmother survived and was treated at a local hospital.
"We are treating this as a rescue, but we are fairly certain we are in recovery mode at this time," Tim Brewer, the fire chief of Upper Makefield in Bucks County, said of the missing children.
He said an estimated six to seven inches of rain fell in less than 45 minutes. "In my 44 years, I've never seen anything like it," he said. "When the water came up, it came up very swiftly."
Eli Weissman, 65, said he and his 22-year-old daughter were trapped in the same deadly flash flood at Washington Crossing.
They were both on board his BMW motorcycle driving home when it suddenly started raining, he said.
"We were only five miles from my house, so we figured we'd head on home instead of waiting it out," Mr. Weissman said. The rain began to pick up, as cars in front of them started stopping, he said.
"Then this water just came rushing down the road," Mr. Weissman said. "It was like a dam burst or something," he added. "It was just nothing I've ever seen before."
He said he and his daughter were thrown off the bike and into the water, which had swiftly risen to around eight feet deep.
"We were floating down and trying to survive the rapids, you know, feet first, clinging to trees, clinging to vines, anything we could cling to," Mr. Weissman said. "It was so fast and so deep."
Around them, cars were deserted and some of them were overturned. At one point, Mr. Weissman said, he "saw a mother get out of her car with an infant and walk away from the car." He said that he believed that they were members of the family from Charleston, though he was not certain.
The water began to recede after 15 minutes or so, he said, and he and his daughter were finally able to stand again. They carefully made their way to the road and back up to drier land, where his son came to pick them up.
"I've seen flooded roads and I've seen rapid water but never like this," he said.
Collin Mortensen, 17, of Upper Makefield Township, said he was making a food run to Colonial Market when the storm started to peak on Saturday evening.
Driving a Ford Expedition, he said, he passed a car that had slid off the road and down a hill, its front axle broken and a wheel twisted. Then he encountered the flooded road.
"I wasn't sure I was going to make it through," Mr. Mortensen said in an interview at the Shell gasoline station where he was working on Sunday afternoon. When he left the market, he said, emergency crews were blocking off a main intersection, as a river of water headed down a hill and east through the village, toward the river.
Overall, officials said, eight people were rescued in cars in Bucks County, where Washington Crossing is located, and two were rescued from a creek. Saturday's flash flooding in Pennsylvania was followed on Sunday by deluges across the Northeast, with flash flood warnings in effect in parts of Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts, Maine and neighboring states. An estimated five inches of rain fell in less than two hours on the east end of Long Island.
Thunderstorms caused flight disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey and Kennedy International Airport in New York. In Maryland, officials said that "life-threatening flash flooding" was expected.
In New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency Sunday afternoon. "Throughout the state, we have seen heavy rainfalls resulting in hazardous conditions, and we urge residents to remain vigilant around flooded roadways and downed trees and power lines," he said in a statement.
Pennsylvania's governor, Josh Shapiro, said he was "concerned about some additional bad weather coming this evening," and he urged Bucks County residents to remain alert and to avoid flood-hazard areas.
By late afternoon, emergency workers had reopened most of the roads in Bucks County but continued to block the area where they were searching for the missing children. Though most waterways had receded, their levels remained higher than usual, and some roadside culverts were still swollen with swiftly running water.
Michael Adler, a lawyer who lives in Holland, Pa., said it was still raining heavily Sunday afternoon.
"We're getting all these alerts on our phones," he said. "Where we are right now, we're not near creeks, but I know that there are lots of creeks and underground creeks in this area, so everybody's a little concerned."

Why Deep-Sea Mining Is the Next Battleground in the Energy Transition: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Countries and companies are in a fight between those that want to excavate minerals used in electric vehicles and others that warn the cost is too high.
Surging demand for metals used in electric vehicle batteries has kicked off an international race to mine the deep seas. And there are no rules.
On Sunday, the International Seabed Authority missed an important deadline to establish a regulatory framework, which means that companies can now apply for licenses before rules are final. Representatives from the agency, which is made up of 167 member states and the European Union, have gathered in Jamaica for two weeks to debate what should happen next.
Canada, France, Germany and others want to pause deep-sea mining because of its largely unknown environmental consequences. But countries including China, Norway and Russia are pushing ahead on establishing a framework, arguing that it is less destructive than land mining.
Seabed exploitation ventures, meanwhile, are eager to get started.
"We're preparing our application," said Gerard Barron, the chief executive of the Metals Company, a Canadian business that has an agreement with the Pacific island country of Nauru to sponsor its deep-sea mining endeavors.
The company preferred that there were final rules before acting, Mr. Barron told DealBook, "but we reserve the right to move forward."
Regulators are under pressure to act. A United Nations convention establishes waters beyond 12 nautical miles from a territorial coast as communal property, which means that profits from minerals discovered there should be shared to some extent. The I.S.A. is responsible for setting up the structure for profit-sharing and taxing of mining efforts, as well as the legal and ecological guidelines. Or it could ban large-scale commercial mining altogether -- though it's not clear there is a legal path for a pause.
Mining could damage ecosystems that scientists don't yet understand, said Jessica Battle, an ocean policy expert at the World Wildlife Fund. A study published in the journal Nature on Tuesday, for example, argued that seabed mining could interfere with tuna migration patterns as climate change drives fish into new waters. Ms. Battle has been leading an effort to have businesses pledge not to finance seabed mining or source seafloor materials in their supply chains. More than 30 companies, including BMW, Google, Samsung, Volvo and Volkswagen, have signed on. Similarly, prominent banks in Britain, such as Lloyds and Standard Chartered, are refusing to do business with deep-sea mining entities. And seafood industry groups have demanded a moratorium.
Some also doubt the economic opportunity. Electric vehicles are expected to make up about 35 percent of cars sold globally by 2030, up from 14 percent in 2022, according to projections from the International Energy Agency. That growth will increase demand for metals like cobalt, copper and nickel that are used in batteries. But critics say that the expense and logistics of mining in the remote ocean -- and transporting metals back to land -- raise doubts about whether deep-sea mining can be profitable. Ms. Battle argued other solutions in the works -- like alternative materials and programs for reusing and recycling batteries -- could sufficiently satisfy demand for critical metals. "This industry could start without being needed," she said of deep-sea mining.
But seabed mining supporters say that existing mining is worse for the environment, and deep-sea mining could help wrestle control of critical metals from China and Russia. Some also see it as an economic lifeline for small island nations that are suffering the worst effects of climate change.
"Do not tell me to ignore the potential for promoting the green transition by not exploring these much-needed minerals for the green revolution that sit in my ocean," Mark Brown, the prime minister of the Cook Islands, said at a U.N. climate conference last year. He referred to claims of environmental concern from countries that destroyed the planet "through decades of profit-driven development" as "patronizing."
Mr. Barron of the Metals Company, who was in Jamaica for the I.S.A. meetings this week, pointed out that even some of the countries calling for a moratorium have exploration licenses, which allow them to experiment with mining on a small scale for research purposes. He believes representatives are deciding not whether deep-sea mining can begin, but when. "That horse has bolted," he said. -- Ephrat Livni
HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
Lina Khan's bumpy week. The head of the F.T.C. lost a bid to block Microsoft's $ 70 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, opened the first big investigation into OpenAI over ChatGPT's privacy and security practices, and was grilled by a Republican-led congressional committee over her approach at the agency. The F.T.C. lost its appeal of the Microsoft ruling.
Hollywood shut down. Actors voted to go on strike for the first time in 43 years, joining screenwriters who had already taken industrial action. Unions say they want better wages, higher fees from streaming services and protections to deal with new technological threats, such as artificial intelligence. Studio bosses say the demands are unrealistic at a time when the entire industry is being disrupted.
The details behind the PGA Tour-LIV Golf talks. A Senate hearing into a potential deal between the rival golf competitions revealed new details about the talks: the agreement was announced before it was done; the PGA Tour didn't have the resources to fight off the Saudi-backed LIV indefinitely; and governance is going to be a crucial part of any final deal.
Meeting over at Shopify. The Canadian e-commerce company embedded a calculator in employees' calendar apps that measures the financial cost of meetings with three or more people. It's the company's latest effort to stop pointless gatherings. It had previously canceled all recurring meetings of more than two people.
Tech stock dominance, by the numbers
The great tech stock rally shows no signs of slowing, with the Nasdaq composite hitting a 15-month high this week. One reason: Wall Street is betting that an improving inflation outlook, underscored by Wednesday's Consumer Price Index, will compel the Federal Reserve to pivot to a more dovish rates policy, which tends to lift tech stocks.
How big has Big Tech gotten? Bank of America researchers ran the numbers this week. Here are three takeaways:
The stock gains this year have been especially concentrated among seven firms: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta.
The combined market capitalization of the so-called magnificent seven is roughly $ 11 trillion, a figure that exceeds the G.D.P. of every country but the United States and China.
This group has seen its combined market cap grow by $ 4 trillion this year.
The companies are cash rich. Six of the seven (all but Amazon) have a combined $ 200 billion net cash-to-debt balance.
What to watch: Big institutional investors have bought in on these stocks, which could sustain the rally in the short run. And the interest-rate risk for these companies is waning. But the bigger they grow, the more attention they could get from politicians.
The "political campaign rhetoric will likely include headline risk around regulation of megacap Tech," Savita Subramanian, Bank of America's head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, writes in the report.
Paris takes on 'auto-besity'
Health authorities have waged a war on obesity for years. Now, in an effort to curtail the rise of big cars such as S.U.V.s and cut down on pollution, Paris has declared a war on "auto-besity." Its first step is to charge drivers more to park the vehicles -- a move that could eventually hit car companies.
S.U.V. use has surged more than 60 percent in Paris over the past four years, according to city officials. That mirrors a broader trend across the European Union, with S.U.V.s accounting for about half of all car sales in the bloc, up from about 14 percent in 2011, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, an auto industry group.
Critics say that is bad for the planet. "We would like the City of Paris to change the pricing of paid parking to make it progressive according to the weight and size of vehicles," Frédéric Badina-Serpette, the city councilor behind the increased charges, told The Guardian. He added that the aim was "to focus on an absurdity: auto-besity ... the inexorable growth in the weight and size of vehicles circulating in our cities."
The new rules will add to carmakers' worries. Details haven't been revealed, but electric vehicles and big families that require bigger vehicles are expected to be exempt. The higher tariffs will go into effect on Jan. 1, and could inspire similar moves in other big cities.
"France has traditionally been one of the most aggressive nations in combating the growth of large cars," Matthias Schmidt, an independent auto analyst, told DealBook. Carlos Tavares, the chief executive of Stellantis, was already pressuring the French government to do more to support the industry, which is starting to feel the effect of Tesla's price cuts and facing the growing threat of Chinese carmakers set to enter Europe. French brands, Mr. Schmidt added, are "in the middle of an uncomfortable sandwich, pressed from above and below."
On our radar: A.I. as a villain
"Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One," the latest installment in Tom Cruise's efforts to transcend physics for the sake of entertainment, is forecast to earn $ 90 million in its first five days, a franchise record. (Mild spoilers ahead.)
But the movie also represents how the hype around artificial intelligence is seeping into pop culture: The big bad guy in the movie is the Entity, a rogue artificial intelligence program that poses a threat to humanity.
Over decades, humans' relationship with artificial intelligence has been explored by movies like "2001: A Space Odyssey," "Ex Machina" and, yes, "A.I." But the public debut of ChatGPT last year, which gave many people their first chance to converse with an A.I., has made visions of sentient technology feel less like science fiction and, for some, stirred up existential dread.
Remember how over 350 A.I. experts called in May for "mitigating the risk of extinction from A.I."? The Entity is capable of "collapsing the world's economic systems, evading national-security protocols and rerouting nuclear weapons on a whim." At least in the movies, a nearly superhuman secret agent can beat back killer technology. (We presume; this is a Cruise movie, after all.) In real life, it may take coordination by lawmakers worldwide -- and time will tell if that mission is ... well, you know.
Thanks for reading! We'll see you on Monday.

Rebel Leaders Met With Putin At the Kremlin: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Kremlin's disclosure of the meeting with Yevgeny V. Prigozhin and other Wagner group commanders hinted at the power they wield, but left many questions unanswered.
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia held a lengthy meeting with Yevgeny V. Prigozhin and commanders of his Wagner private military company just days after they had launched a mutiny that put the nation on the brink of a civil conflict, the Kremlin disclosed on Monday.
Mr. Putin had denounced the leaders of the June 23-24 rebellion as traitors, so the startling revelation that he played host to them on June 29 suggests that for all his bluster, he saw a continued use for the mercenary group and its boss. The meeting is the first known contact between the two men since the uprising, which posed the most dramatic challenge to Mr. Putin's authority in his 23 years in power.
News of the meeting added to the mystery of what will become of Mr. Prigozhin and his force after the insurrection. It remains unclear why a warlord with his own private army, who attempted to depose the Russian military leadership by force, has been allowed to remain in the country, apparently unhindered, allegedly even returning to his hometown, St. Petersburg, to pick up his confiscated guns.
Mr. Putin invited 35 people to the three-hour meeting, including Mr. Prigozhin and all of Wagner's top commanders, and gave his assessment of the company's efforts on the battlefield in Ukraine, as well as its actions in the mutiny, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitri S. Peskov said.
The Wagner fighters also offered their explanation of what had transpired, according to Mr. Peskov, who suggested the gathering was a chance to clear the air and set a course going forward. "Putin heard out the commanders and proposed further employment options and further combat options," he said.
The Wagner fighters pledged their loyalty to the Russian leader during the meeting, the Kremlin spokesman added.
"They emphasized that they are staunch supporters and soldiers of the head of state and commander in chief -- and also said they are prepared to fight for the country going forward," he said.
The picture of Mr. Prigozhin and his top lieutenants sitting peacefully at a table with the Russian leader -- just days after Mr. Putin had vowed to crush their rebellion -- contrasted with the widely held image of Mr. Putin as a ruthless authoritarian, adept at squelching threats to his rule.
It appeared to reflect a calculation by the Kremlin to avoid fully eradicating an experienced fighting force with a popular following in the middle of a costly war. The Russian president, some analysts say, may also view the insurrection as little more than a factional feud that got out of control. Mr. Prigozhin has said he set out to topple the Russian military leadership -- not to challenge Mr. Putin's rule.
"I would not assume that Prigozhin is back into Putin's best graces forever and nothing has happened. Something has happened. Conclusions have been drawn for now," said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. "But just crushing them and crushing him at this point is for some reason disadvantageous, compared to keeping him afloat."
Andrei Soldatov, a Russian security services expert, said Mr. Putin's tough talk about treachery had been aimed primarily at the Russian military, to prevent any commanders from siding with the mutiny. Afterward, he said, the president and Mr. Prigozhin "just made another deal."
"We don't know the terms," Mr. Soldatov added. "But the understanding is they know each other, know what to expect from each other, thus they can still cooperate or work together."
But the revolt put Mr. Putin's vulnerability on global display, and the admission that he chatted with Wagner leaders risks making him look weaker still.
Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of the R.Politik political consultancy, said the Kremlin possibly decided to disclose the meeting to calm a Russian elite that remains confused about what transpired -- about whether Mr. Prigozhin is a "traitor or our guy."
"It's a signal to the elite that Prigozhin remains systemic," Ms. Stanovaya said. "Yes, he made a mistake, yes, this is a very serious crime. But due to the specifics of the situation, which is really very unique, Putin will give him the opportunity to survive."
The mutiny exposed Mr. Putin's inability or unwillingness to deal with a power struggle that for months had raged in the open, with Mr. Prigozhin regularly launching profanity-laced invective at Russia's military leadership on Telegram. Ms. Stanovaya, who is also a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said she suspected Mr. Putin felt at least partly responsible for not better managing the escalating feud.
"So for Putin, Prigozhin is of course a traitor, but he's his traitor," Ms. Stanovaya said. "That is, a person who made a mistake out of stupidity, rather than out of malice."
The Kremlin previously had been deflecting questions about Mr. Prigozhin's status and whereabouts.
On the day Mr. Putin and Mr. Prigozhin met, Mr. Peskov told reporters he didn't know where Mr. Prigozhin was. The following week, Mr. Peskov said the Kremlin had neither the "ability nor the desire" to track his movements.
But on Friday, the French newspaper Libération reported that Mr. Putin had met with Mr. Prigozhin and his Wagner commanders at the Kremlin to "negotiate the fate of his empire," which include a range of business ventures.
On Monday, Mr. Peskov confirmed that the meeting took place, but added, "The details of it are unknown."
Mr. Prigozhin's forces have been important to Russia's war against Ukraine, but last month the government ordered Wagner troops fighting there to join the regular military. Facing a major loss of power, Mr. Prigozhin railed loudly against the move, to no avail.
His fighters seized the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, and an important Russian military headquarters there, and staged a drive on Moscow that stopped within 125 miles of the capital.
Mr. Putin warned in a national address against a descent into civil war, and said the harshest punishment awaited those who had "consciously chosen the path of betrayal."
But the punishment didn't come.
Hours later, the Kremlin announced a deal, allegedly brokered by the Belarusian leader Aleksandr G. Lukashenko: Mr. Prigozhin would stand down, avoid prosecution and depart for Belarus. Wagner fighters who had participated in the mutiny would also avoid punishment; those who didn't participate would be given the chance to sign Russian military contracts.
Mr. Prigozhin and his men packed up and retreated.
The agreement outraged hard-line Russian commentators, who noted that the insurrectionists had shot down Russian aircraft, killing military personnel.
In the days since, Mr. Prigozhin's status has been a mystery. He hasn't made any public appearances. His company has stopped posting responses to questions from the media. The man who stepped out of the shadows last year to make a public name for himself has gone quiet, at least temporarily.
Perhaps the biggest surprise of all is that in the world of Mr. Putin, where those causing political problems have regularly ended up imprisoned or killed, Mr. Prigozhin is not only still alive but appears to be moving freely around Russia.
Mr. Lukashenko said days after the mutiny that Mr. Prigozhin had arrived in Belarus, but it is not clear if that was true. Last week the Belarusian leader said Mr. Prigozhin was in Russia -- which U.S. officials confirmed -- and was a "free man."
On Thursday, Mr. Prigozhin was spotted arriving in a BMW 7-series sedan at the St. Petersburg headquarters of the F.S.B., a successor to the Soviet-era K.G.B., where he collected weapons that the Russian authorities had seized from his country house during the mutiny, the independent news outlet Fontanka reported. Days earlier, Fontanka said, one of his drivers had arrived to collect billions of rubles, hundreds of thousands of dollars and several gold bars that Russian authorities had seized in vehicles parked at St. Petersburg hotels associated with him.
Mr. Lukashenko said just after the uprising that Wagner fighters, like their leader, would be welcome in Belarus. Last week, his government said none had come, but that that might change.
A prominent Wagner commander, Anton Yelizarov, who goes by the nom de guerre Lotos, gave an interview to a Russian war blogger on Friday, from southern Russia, in which he said all Wagner fighters had been released on break until early August -- and suggested he was spending time with his family by the sea.
In the interview, posted on Telegram, Mr. Yelizarov said Wagner would stand aside in Ukraine for the time being and had a lot of work to do to prepare its "exit" to Belarus.
"There's no clash with law enforcement agencies, the president guaranteed us that," Mr. Yelizarov said. "As for society and normal people, you can see for yourself: girls are walking around with patches that they coaxed off our guys, most likely for kisses. Boys are wearing T-shirts and hats with our logos. Little kids are playing war games, with the Ukrainians as the Germans and Wagner PMC fighters as the Red Army."
He didn't exclude the possibility of the mercenary group becoming involved again in Ukraine. "Our armored train is in reserve, and we stand ready to come to the aid of our Motherland and our nation when the Russian people call us," he said.

President Vladimir Putin of Russia held a lengthy meeting with Yevgeny Prigozhin and commanders of his Wagner private military company just days after they had launched a mutiny that put the nation on the brink of a civil conflict, the Kremlin disclosed Monday.
Putin had denounced the leaders of the June 23-24 rebellion as traitors, so the startling revelation that he played host to them on June 29 suggests that for all his bluster, he saw a continued use for the mercenary group and its boss. The meeting is the first known contact between the two men since the uprising, which posed the most dramatic challenge to Putin’s authority in his 23 years in power.
News of the meeting added to the mystery of what will become of Prigozhin and his force after the insurrection. It remains unclear why a warlord with his own private army, who attempted to depose the Russian military leadership by force, has been allowed to remain in the country, apparently unhindered, allegedly even returning to his hometown, St. Petersburg, to pick up his confiscated guns.
Putin invited 35 people to the three-hour meeting, including Prigozhin and all of Wagner’s top commanders, and gave his assessment of the company’s efforts on the battlefield in Ukraine, as well as its actions in the mutiny, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.
Wagner fighters also offered their explanation of what had transpired, according to Peskov, who suggested the gathering was a chance to clear the air and set a course going forward. “Putin heard out the commanders and proposed further employment options and further combat options,” he said.
Wagner fighters pledged their loyalty to the Russian leader during the meeting, Peskov added.
“They emphasized that they are staunch supporters and soldiers of the head of state and commander in chief — and also said they are prepared to fight for the country going forward,” he said.
The picture of Prigozhin and his top lieutenants sitting peacefully at a table with the Russian leader — just days after Putin had vowed to crush their rebellion — contrasted with the widely held image of Putin as a ruthless authoritarian, adept at squelching threats to his rule.
It appeared to reflect a calculation by the Kremlin to avoid fully eradicating an experienced fighting force with a popular following in the middle of a costly war. Putin, some analysts say, may also view the insurrection as little more than a factional feud that got out of control. Prigozhin has said he set out to topple the Russian military leadership — not to challenge Putin’s rule.
“I would not assume that Prigozhin is back into Putin’s best graces forever and nothing has happened. Something has happened. Conclusions have been drawn for now,” said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. “But just crushing them and crushing him at this point is for some reason disadvantageous, compared to keeping him afloat.”
Andrei Soldatov, a Russian security services expert, said Putin’s tough talk about treachery had been aimed primarily at the Russian military, to prevent any commanders from siding with the mutiny. Afterward, he said, the president and Prigozhin “just made another deal.”
“We don’t know the terms,” Soldatov added. “But the understanding is they know each other, know what to expect from each other, thus they can still cooperate or work together.”
But the revolt put Putin’s vulnerability on global display, and the admission that he chatted with Wagner leaders risks making him look weaker still.
Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of the R.Politik political consultancy, said the Kremlin possibly decided to disclose the meeting to calm a Russian elite that remains confused about what transpired — about whether Prigozhin is a “traitor or our guy.”
“It’s a signal to the elite that Prigozhin remains systemic,” Stanovaya said. “Yes, he made a mistake, yes, this is a very serious crime. But due to the specifics of the situation, which is really very unique, Putin will give him the opportunity to survive.”
The mutiny exposed Putin’s inability or unwillingness to deal with a power struggle that for months had raged in the open, with Prigozhin regularly launching profanity-laced invective at Russia’s military leadership on Telegram. Stanovaya, who is also a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said she suspected Putin felt at least partly responsible for not better managing the escalating feud.
“So for Putin, Prigozhin is of course a traitor, but he’s his traitor,” Stanovaya said. “That is, a person who made a mistake out of stupidity, rather than out of malice.”
The Kremlin previously had been deflecting questions about Prigozhin’s status and whereabouts.
On the day Putin and Prigozhin met, Peskov told reporters he didn’t know where Prigozhin was. The following week, Peskov said the Kremlin had neither the “ability nor the desire” to track his movements.
But on Friday, the French newspaper Libération reported that Putin had met with Prigozhin and his Wagner commanders at the Kremlin to “negotiate the fate of his empire,” which includes a range of business ventures.
On Monday, Peskov confirmed that the meeting took place, but added, “The details of it are unknown.”
Prigozhin’s forces have been important to Russia’s war against Ukraine, but last month the government ordered Wagner troops fighting there to join the regular military. Facing a major loss of power, Prigozhin railed loudly against the move, to no avail.
His fighters seized the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, and an important Russian military headquarters there, and staged a drive on Moscow that stopped within 125 miles of the capital.
Putin warned in a national address against a descent into civil war, and said the harshest punishment awaited those who had “consciously chosen the path of betrayal.”
But the punishment didn’t come.
Hours later, the Kremlin announced a deal, allegedly brokered by Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko: Prigozhin would stand down, avoid prosecution and depart for Belarus. Wagner fighters who had participated in the mutiny would also avoid punishment; those who didn’t participate would be given the chance to sign Russian military contracts.
Prigozhin and his men packed up and retreated.
The agreement outraged hard-line Russian commentators, who noted that the insurrectionists had shot down Russian aircraft, killing military personnel.
In the days since, Prigozhin’s status has been a mystery. He hasn’t made any public appearances. His company has stopped posting responses to questions from the media. The man who stepped out of the shadows last year to make a public name for himself has gone quiet, at least temporarily.
Perhaps the biggest surprise of all is that in the world of Putin, where those causing political problems have regularly ended up imprisoned or killed, Prigozhin is not only still alive but appears to be moving freely around Russia.
Lukashenko said days after the mutiny that Prigozhin had arrived in Belarus, but it is not clear if that was true. Last week Lukashenko said Prigozhin was in Russia — which U.S. officials confirmed — and was a “free man.”
On Thursday, Prigozhin was spotted arriving in a BMW 7-series sedan at the St. Petersburg headquarters of the FSB, a successor to the Soviet-era KGB, where he collected weapons that Russian authorities had seized from his country house during the mutiny, the independent news outlet Fontanka reported. Days earlier, Fontanka said, one of his drivers had arrived to collect billions of rubles, hundreds of thousands of dollars and several gold bars that Russian authorities had seized in vehicles parked at St. Petersburg hotels associated with him.

NATO's Newest Border With Russia Is Quiet Now, but Finland Is Wary: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Finland's membership in the Western military alliance has increased NATO's borders with Russia by 830 miles -- and angered Moscow.
On a recent afternoon along Finland's border with Russia, an attack from Russian military bases a few miles away seemed a distant prospect.
That's not only because, as NATO's newest member, Finland now enjoys the guaranteed protection of 30 nations, including the United States -- a development that President Biden will celebrate during a visit to Helsinki next week.
It's also because most of the Russians once stationed in the area went to fight in Ukraine, and many if not most of them, Finnish officials say, are dead. It may be years before Russia poses a conventional military threat from across the verdant forest of pine, spruce and birch.
But there were some Russians to be seen on a sunny June day at the Vaalimaa border crossing, about midway between Helsinki and St. Petersburg. A trickle came and went, many in expensive cars: an Audi Q7, a black BMW with two sleek bikes mounted on a rack. These Russians were likely dual passport holders, possibly headed to other European countries that they can reach only by land because of flight restrictions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year.
For anyone trying to cross the border illicitly, border guard foot patrols roam the woods. But their trail-sniffing dogs encounter few Russians trying to sneak into Finland.
"We do have some Finns trying to sneak that way," said Matti Pitkäniitty, an official with the Finnish Border Guard, who guided a visitor around the site, "but normally they are mental cases." Perhaps the biggest concern on this afternoon was a black bear seen prowling the area.
The peaceful scene belies the fear among many Finns that despite Russia's weakened state, this transit point, and their country, could one day become a Russian target. That anxiety prompted Finland to seek membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization last year, a process completed in April when Finland became its 31st member in what Mr. Biden calls a strategic blow for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.
That move infused a long, placid relationship between Moscow and Helsinki with sharp new tensions. In January, Russia's military announced plans to add a new army corps to the border region of Karelia.
And on Thursday, Russia's foreign ministry said it was expelling nine Finnish diplomats -- payback for Finland's expulsion last month of nine Russian diplomats accused of being intelligence operatives -- and would shutter Finland's consulate in St. Petersburg this fall. A foreign ministry statement said that Finland's membership in NATO and its support for Ukraine posed "a threat to the security of the Russian Federation" and amounts to "clearly hostile actions."
But Finnish officials say the only threat is Russia.
"The Finns think that we could quite easily be in the position that the Ukrainians are in," Mr. Pitkäniitty said. Gesturing to a road that crosses the border through the forest, he added: "If a Russian division wants to attack Helsinki, they need to go through here. You would be seeing ruins and smoke here."
Such an attack would have vastly greater consequences, now that Finland's border -- an 830-mile frontier that runs roughly north-south from the Barents Sea to the Gulf of Finland -- has become a NATO boundary, more than doubling Russia's existing borders with NATO countries. Under the alliance's charter, a Russian attack on Finland would be treated as an attack on all NATO members.
No one expects such an invasion anytime soon. But history leaves Finland understandably wary.
Etched in the country's national memory is Joseph Stalin's 1939 invasion and conquest of thousands of square miles of Finnish territory that Russia holds to this day. The Soviet leader believed that St. Petersburg required a larger buffer area to its west for protection, so he created one by force, at the cost of many thousands of lives.
After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, many Finns revisited that dark chapter of their history.
"It wasn't hard for Finns to imagine themselves in the Ukrainians' shoes. They'd walked in them," Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said during a visit to Helsinki in early June. "To many Finns, the parallels between 1939 and 2022 were striking."
For now, the NATO alliance has no plans to install infrastructure or station troops at the border, although its members are eager to learn more about it: U.S. and European officials have been visiting to assess its vulnerabilities and Finnish preparations.
The Finns say not to worry. For one thing, they proudly recall the huge casualties they inflicted on the invading Soviet forces in 1939 -- employing insurgent-style ambush tactics against a poorly led and equipped enemy, much as the Ukrainians would nearly a century later. Stalin's successor, Nikita Khrushchev, later said that while the Soviets had prevailed over the vastly outnumbered Finns, they had in fact suffered defeat, because "it encouraged our enemies' conviction that the Soviet Union was a colossus with feet of clay."
Partly thanks to bitter memories of that conflict, Finland's border guard doubles as a branch of its military. Its members receive full military training, and its units are equipped with body armor and semiautomatic rifles, though one team of three that patrolled around Vaalimaa on a recent day had stashed that gear; the only visible enemies were constant swarms of mosquitoes.
In their current numbers, though, the border guards would be of little use against a Russian military assault. It is one for which Finland has almost literally paved the way: A few years ago, Finland upgraded the highway that runs between Helsinki and Vaalimaa to accommodate trade and travel between Finland and Russia, which boomed in the last decade.
But border traffic today is below one-third of its prepandemic levels, and the road is lightly traveled.
The force of the NATO alliance, and its Article 5 treaty mandating collective self-defense, eases fears of attack. "That's the biggest reason why we joined -- to get the Article 5 cover," Brig. Gen. Sami Nurmi, a Finnish defense policy official, said in an April interview. "And also, of course, that deterrence aspect."
In the near term, the Finns are more worried about a very different form of warfare -- weaponized migration. About 60 miles north of Vaalimaa, Finland has begun to install its first border fence.
In late 2015 and early 2016, Finland experienced a surge of asylum-seeking migrants crossing the Russian border, most of them from third countries. Finnish officials saw the hand of Moscow, which has repeatedly directed migrants into European countries in an apparent effort to destabilize their politics.
"The impression that someone is organizing and regulating things on the Russian side is probably true," Finland's foreign minister, Timo Soini, told the country's state broadcaster at the time. "It is quite obvious that activity like this is a managed effort."
The Finns were caught off guard. "Never in my wildest dreams did I anticipate that we would have, for example, Bangladeshis coming with bicycles to a high north border crossing when the sun doesn't come up at all and it's minus 20-25 degrees Celsius," Mr. Pitkäniitty said, or minus 4 to minus 13 degrees Fahrenheit.
Despite that experience, Mr. Pitkäniitty said that he and his colleagues maintain cordial and professional relations with their Russian counterparts across the border. The two sides communicate regularly, he said.
"When we talk to the Russians we try to avoid politics," Mr. Pitkäniitty said. "There is no point in arguing. You just end up in a dispute that does not allow for solutions."
For years, he said, acceptable conversation topics with the Russians included fishing, hunting and sports. "Now we have to exclude sports, because they do not participate in international sports anymore," Mr. Pitkäniitty said. "So it's fishing and hunting you can safely talk about with the Russian officers."
At the same time, "I know that they will not hesitate to shoot me in the back if ordered to do so," he added. "Just as I would do the same to them."

Pieces of Munich Synagogue Destroyed on Hitler's Orders Are Found in River: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The demolition of the city's main synagogue was an early sign of the terrible destruction to come under the Nazi regime.
Eighty-five years ago, Munich's main synagogue was demolished on direct orders from Adolf Hitler -- a terrible harbinger of the destruction to come.
The synagogue was among the first Jewish places of worship to be destroyed in Hitler's Germany. Five months later, the Nazis organized countrywide pogroms and laid waste to most of the country's synagogues, as well as Jewish cultural institutions and businesses.
The Munich main synagogue was lost to history, or so it seemed. But this week, during a project to refurbish old underwater infrastructure, a construction crew found pieces of the synagogue in a river five miles from where it once stood in Munich. The discovery was a shock, but a joyful one for Munich's Jewish community.
The items construction workers found, including columns and a large piece of the synagogue's Torah shrine, were 15 to 25 feet below the surface of the Isar River at a site south of Munich. The building's remnants were used as landfill material when workers rebuilt an underwater structure after flooding in 1956.
"I knew the imposing building as a child before it was torn down, and I never thought that parts of it could have survived the destruction, much less for them to resurface almost a century later," said Charlotte Knobloch, the president of the Jewish Community of Munich and Upper Bavaria, in an email.
Though Munich's leaders are glad to see pieces of the synagogue reappear, the discovery also shines a spotlight once again on the horrifying actions of the Nazis, who murdered six million Jews and systematically destroyed Jewish life.
The newly found relics illustrate important points, Bernhard Purin, the director of the Jewish Museum in Munich, explained in an interview. "On the one hand, they document the blossoming Jewish life in Munich before 1933," he said. "On the other, they are a monument to its destruction."
Completed in 1887, the synagogue was designed to blend in with Munich's architectural style. A newspaper review at the time called it an "ornament of the city."
Hitler ordered it destroyed in June 1938 after visiting the neighborhood days before. Officially, it was removed to make room for a parking lot. The company in charge of the demolition stored the rubble in its yard until using it to fortify the river infrastructure in the mid-1950s.
Now, a stone sculpture tucked between a high-end department store and a BMW museum reminds passers-by where the synagogue stood.
"Today, we are as much amazed to see fragments of the old main synagogue turn up again as we are in shock at the lack of respect with which they were treated even after 1945," Ms. Knobloch wrote.
Before 1938, nearly every significant German town had a synagogue. Most of these temples were destroyed in November 1938 during the pogroms, known as Kristallnacht. The few that survived were spared because they were too close to buildings owned by non-Jews to be demolished by the Nazis.
Aerial bombardments during World War II reduced many German cities to rubble so the remnants of many destroyed synagogues are gone forever. Fragments of another synagogue in Frankfurt in the 1980s led to sustained protests to prevent the city from building on the site. Eventually the remains in Frankfurt were put under glass to be viewed by visitors.
This week, Munich's mayor, Dieter Reiter, said in a statement that the destruction of the Munich synagogue was the "beginning of exclusion, persecution and destruction" of German Jews. "The fact that today we find remains of the once cityscape-defining magnificent building is a stroke of luck and moves me very deeply," he continued.
Now that officials know what was hidden in the underwater rubble, an estimated 150 tons of it will be transferred to a city yard to be carefully scrutinized for more pieces of the synagogue -- a job that could take years.

Lukashenko Says Prigozhin Is in Russia, Not Belarus

MINSK, Belarus — Mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin is in Russia and a “free man,” the leader of Belarus said Thursday, adding to the questions swirling around Prigozhin’s fate nearly two weeks after he called off his stunning armed rebellion against Moscow’s military leadership.
In a rare interview session with reporters at Independence Palace, the autocratic leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, said that Prigozhin was in his native city of St. Petersburg, Russia, as of Thursday morning, and then “maybe he went to Moscow, maybe somewhere else, but he is not on the territory of Belarus.” That was a contrast with statements he made days after the mutiny, when he said that the head of the Wagner paramilitary forces had arrived in Belarus. Prigozhin has not been seen in public since the rebellion nearly two weeks ago.
A Pentagon official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation later confirmed that Prigozhin had been in Russia, between Moscow and St. Petersburg, during most of the period since the mutiny. The official said it was unclear if Prigozhin had ever gone to Belarus because he apparently uses body doubles to mask his movements.
Lukashenko intervened late last month in the armed mutiny led by Prigozhin, striking a deal with the Wagner leader that saw him stand down and withdraw his forces in exchange for amnesty for his fighters and safe passage to Belarus for himself. Prigozhin’s apparent presence in Russia raises questions about the future of the deal.
Lukashenko told journalists that Prigozhin was “not on the territory of Belarus,” nor were Wagner troops, who he said remained in their “permanent camps,” believed to be in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine.
The comments added to the confusion surrounding the aftermath of the most dramatic challenge to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s authority in his 23 years in power. The Kremlin refused to comment on Lukashenko’s claims, telling reporters Thursday that it was unaware of Prigozhin’s whereabouts.
“We don’t follow his movements. We have neither the ability nor the desire to do so,” said Dmitri Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson.
The independent St. Petersburg news outlet Fontanka, which broke some of the earliest stories about Prigozhin, reported that the mercenary boss was in St. Petersburg earlier this week, collecting weapons that Russian authorities seized from his country house during the mutiny.
During the night between Tuesday and Wednesday, Prigozhin arrived at the city’s Federal Security Services building in a BMW 7 Series and received a cache of carbines, automatic rifles and pistols that authorities had taken from his country residence, Fontanka reported. Among the guns returned to Prigozhin was a Glock pistol awarded to him by the Russian defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, before the official became the object of the mercenary chief’s ire, the Russian media outlet said.
Lukashenko also signaled that at least some of Wagner’s fighting force — which was instrumental in Russia’s capture of the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut this spring — could stay intact. He called the group Russia’s “most powerful unit,” although he said that “the main question of where Wagner will be deployed and what will it do — it doesn’t depend on me; it depends on the leadership of Russia.”
Lukashenko said that he had spoken to Prigozhin on Wednesday and that Wagner would continue to “fulfill its duties to Russia for as long as it can.” He said Prigozhin was “a free man, but what will happen later, I don’t know.”
He said he did not expect that Putin would seek immediate vengeance for the failed mutiny. “If you think that Putin is so malicious and vindictive that he will ‘kill’ Prigozhin tomorrow — no, this will not happen,” he said.
Lukashenko previously said that he had offered Wagner fighters an “abandoned” military base, and satellite images verified by The New York Times last week showed new temporary structures being built at a deserted base about 80 miles from Minsk, the Belarusian capital. But Thursday, Lukashenko appeared less definitive about the possible presence of Wagner troops in Belarus.
“Whether they will come here, and if so, how many of them will come, we will decide in the future,” he said.
Lukashenko said any Wagner units in Belarus could be called upon to defend the country and that the group’s agreement to fight for Belarus in the event of a war was the main condition for granting it permission to relocate to the country.
“If we must activate this unit for the defense of the nation, then it will be immediately activated,” he said. “And their experience will be in high demand.”
The Pentagon official said there was no sign that any Wagner fighters were in Belarus and that most appeared to still be at their garrison in eastern Ukraine. There was little evidence that many were joining the Russian military, the official said.
After the rebellion in Russia late last month, Lukashenko positioned himself as a power broker who had helped avert a crisis, even as he has become increasingly isolated from the rest of the world. Viewed by the West as a subordinate under the Kremlin’s control, Lukashenko appears to be trying to burnish his image as a key player in resolving one of the biggest crises of Putin’s tenure as Russia’s leader.
By granting an interview session with a small group of reporters at his presidential palace Thursday, Lukashenko may be hoping to establish a measure of independence from his benefactors in Moscow while possibly getting a boost at home with an electorate more interested in peace than joining Putin’s war in Ukraine.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Of all the many Madonna-related posts that have appeared on social media since it was revealed that the artist had been taken ill and forced to postpone her "Celebration" tour, one in particular stood out -- not just because of what it said, but because of what it showed.
It was "M" herself, sitting conspiratorially at home with a pale bearded man -- the designer Guram Gvasalia of Vetements, the subversively indie brand that upended fashion in 2014 by elevating the anti-glamorous. Mr. Gvasalia, it turned out, had been secretly working with her for the last five months on the looks for "Celebration."
"Designing your costumes was such a privilege and honor," he wrote next to the picture, adding, "now I understand why you are who you are. You are a fighter, you are an icon, you are THE QUEEN."
If the timing seemed a little self-interested -- new dates for the tour have not yet been announced -- one thing was clear: Three decades after Madonna transformed the fortunes of another designer, Jean Paul Gaultier, via her "Blond Ambition" tour, the blockbuster that made Mr. Gaultier's cone bras into a symbol of sexual rebellion and his name forever a part of pop culture history, Mr. Gvasalia is hoping that even the appearance of her imprimatur may do the same for him.
"I think it gives you certain recognition and credibility," Mr. Gvasalia said of being chosen to work with Madonna. "When she can ask anyone in the world, and people will probably do it for free and be less complicated than I am, it gives you a certain security that you've done something right. It's really a blessing."
Certainly, if the tour happens, it will introduce Mr. Gvasalia, 37, to a much wider audience. He officially took over as creative director of Vetements only in late 2021, and before that was known primarily as the business partner and younger brother of Demna, the mononymic, much feted, latterly almost canceled designer of Balenciaga. (This despite the fact that the two brothers started Vetements together and Guram was as responsible as anyone for building it into a brand with 5.2 million Instagram followers and about 400 retailers worldwide.)
Along with the new Vetements collection, released digitally last week and featuring a bounty of grandiose proportions, the Madonna seal of approval may finally move him fully out of the shadow of his brother.
Though even there, his ambition, like his clothes, is outsize and impossible to miss. He did say he had made his trousers, puffers and skirts 16 times larger than normal in part because he was "trying to understand what is the maximum oversize I can make that still looks like clothes and you can wear but nobody else can make anything bigger."
Consider the Kardashians
History, not to mention literature, is rife with stories of sibling love and rivalry. It is one of our strongest, and most fraught, bonds. While fashion has had the occasional sibling partners -- Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen of the Row; Kate and Laura Mulleavy, who founded Rodarte; Dean and Dan Caten of Dsquared2 -- never before have two siblings who started together ended up quarterbacking fashion teams that are, if not exactly playing the same game, certainly aiming for a similar league.
"You guys really misunderstand how it is," Mr. Gvasalia said, referring to the fashion media. He was sitting on the terrace of the Aman hotel in New York, drinking a Coke and wearing big black boots with barnstormer platform treads, a white gold Cartier nail bracelet, two Cartier gold chain necklaces, a diamond wedding band, a Cartier panther ring and gold grills on his teeth.
"My brother is six years older. When I'm in the second grade, he's in the eighth. He got certain opportunities in life earlier. But if you consider where I am today, where my brother was when he was my age, I think I'm far more advanced."
Mr. Gvasalia tucked his hands through the giant rips in the thighs of his oversize black jeans as if they were pockets and took a breath. He can be charming and erudite and breathtakingly ego-centric, all at the same time.
"I give you the best example that everyone can relate to," he went on: "The Kardashians. You have Kim, who is a great person -- we think she's phenomenal -- and you have Kylie. Kylie's the young generation. She's been very successful without having sex tapes, without having to go through all the things that her sister had to go through. Another example is Venus and Serena Williams. They're both fantastic. But somehow there was a point where Serena managed to kind of take over.
"I think my brother is very talented, but I have a completely different approach to things. He had his good run of 10 years, and I think his era is slowly going to its finish line. Now it is my time."
Is that why he chose to post his Madonna reveal not long after the Balenciaga couture show?
"It's just the right time for us, after the momentum from our show," he said. Then he added, "Balenciaga always releases news on the day of our show, so I feel it's only fair." "Always" may be something of an exaggeration, though he did point out, "They announced Demna's appointment on my birthday." That was true (Oct. 7, 2015) though it's a long time to carry a grudge.
Sometimes it's hard not to wonder if Mr. Gvasalia knows what he is saying -- or how it may be received -- or if he is purposely trying to roil the pot. After all, said Julie Gilhart, chief development officer and president of Tomorrow Consulting, who started following Vetements not long after its debut: "There's nothing sloppy about Guram. I sat with him once in an airport lounge and saw the way his bag was organized -- it was perfect. Everything had a place. He never stops thinking. And he is very precise."
'It's not enough to be good. I need to be very good.'
Currently the two Gvasalias are trying to keep their public selves separate. Demna dropped his surname in late 2021. Guram said he would rather I not speak to his brother for this piece. When I requested comment from Demna anyway, he declined, via a spokeswoman, to respond.
Still, it's almost impossible to disentangle their stories.
Demna and Guram were born in Sokhumi, Georgia. When Guram was 7, civil war broke out and the family fled home, leaving everything behind. They spent a month lost in the mountains before eventually making their way to Düsseldorf, Germany, where the boys grew up. (In 2021, Guram told Forbes Georgia that if his family had stayed in Georgia, "I would probably be running for president.")
"They have a shared sense of survival that makes them very disciplined and resilient," said Jean Delmas, who, along with his partner, Heidi Yang, has been working with Guram as a sales agent for almost a decade.
Parental pressure dictated that Guram, like his brother, go to business school, but he also earned a master's degree at the London College of Fashion (he wrote his thesis on Martin Margiela), with after-school stints at Burberry and Selfridges. In 2012, he self-published a book called "Size Zero: A Guide to Spiritual Management" about "how you need to get rid of everything in your head and just listen to your heart." Two years later, he joined forces with his brother, who had been working at Margiela and Louis Vuitton, to start Vetements.
They decided to frame their new label as a "collective" because, Guram said, "we didn't want to put ourselves out there. It was always just about making the clothes and making what we felt was right." If pressed, they would say Demna was the creative one, and Guram the businessman.
"Everyone was kind of doing everything," Guram said. "You're a designer, a manager, a cleaning person; everything."
"No one really knew what was going on," Ms. Gilhart said. "But anyone who knew anything about the business knew Guram was a big part of it. He hears and sees everything."
Vetements detonated in the fashion world so effectively that in 2015, Demna was hired at Balenciaga. The next year, Guram
relocated to Zurich, along with the business -- a decision he said was less related to taxes than to the desire to get away from the fashion establishment. Zurich is German-speaking; German is one of the four languages he speaks fluently (the others are Georgian, Russian and English, though he is also pretty capable in French and Italian).
Demna and his husband soon followed, but by 2019, Demna announced he was leaving Vetements to focus his attention on Balenciaga; he has since left Zurich for Geneva.
"I find the world has for me completely different expectations than from everyone else," Guram said of the pressure he now feels. "The moment I do something, the bar is really super high. Because we changed the industry, because we were so shocking. And because my brother has a big name and has done a lot of things. Having him in my life puts more challenge on me. You know, it's not enough to be good. I need to be very good."
Lagerfeld dreams
According to Mr. Delmas, the move to designer was less of a leap for Mr. Gvasalia than the popular narrative may make it seem. "Even when Demna was there, Guram would edit the line," Mr. Delmas said. He would "add some pieces to what was in the showroom. He has a good idea of what is viable commercially."
Still, Mr. Gvasalia has begun to differentiate his Vetements, focusing more on tailoring and luxury fabrics. It is certainly priced like a luxury brand, with leather coats between $ 3,000- $ 10,000, and dresses that can run from a few thousand to more than $ 75,000. "The styling seems more involved, the fashion seems a little more high-concept," said Noah Johnson, the global style director of GQ, who said he was beginning to wonder if "maybe he was the mastermind of Vetements all along."
The most recent collection, Mr. Gvasalia's third, was rife with Easter eggs that reflect his dreams, goals and hangups. Alongside the acres of puddling denim paired with narrow corsetry and swaddling down were two very long, very Chanel-like coat dresses, shown over jeans, a nod to Karl Lagerfeld, whose longevity in fashion made him a role model for Mr. Gvasalia.
Also included: a choker necklace with an "M" at the front, a relic of his work with Madonna (she wore a similar necklace in an Instagram post in May). And a group of bell-shaped gowns with skirts six meters in diameter, integral gloves and face masks that, as Nicole Phelps wrote for Vogue Runway, bore a marked resemblance to the bell-shaped dresses Demna made for a Balenciaga show in 2019, spliced with the full-coverage bodysuit Balenciaga gown Kim Kardashian wore to the Met Gala in 2021.
"Those dresses, they're much, much smaller," Mr. Gvasalia said of the Balenciaga looks. "They have a completely different construction. And honestly, I think all the brands in the world have done these kinds of dresses. I also think if you look at them next to each other, ours are much better."
'There is still something coming.'
Mr. Gvasalia has spent the last five months hopping back and forth from his headquarters in Zurich to showrooms in Paris to New York, where Madonna is based.
In Zurich, he lives in a house on a lake just outside the city with his partner of almost 10 years, a Russian-raised entertainment mogul who asked to remain anonymous but has pitched in with the Vetements business so Mr. Gvasalia can concentrate more on the creative side. They also have an apartment on the Avenue George V in Paris, just across the street from the Four Seasons hotel (where his parents stay when they are in town) and up the street from the Balenciaga couture salons. They are, Mr. Gvasalia said, "perfect" together.
When Mr. Gvasalia comes to see Madonna in New York, he stays at the Aman. He does not collect art, but he does collect very high-end watches (Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet) as well as Hermès bags ("all in croc"); vintage Margiela, Gaultier and Montana; and nice cars. (His current ride of choice is a Rolls-Royce SUV.)
For years Mr. Gvasalia was very shy and refused to have his picture taken, Mr. Delmas said, but recently he has done something of an about-face, creating a public persona -- much as Karl Lagerfeld did -- that involves sweeping leathers with jutting shoulders and cinched waists, giant ripped black jeans, giant T-shirts, black shades and lots of jewelry.
He also acquired some custom-made grills from a dentist turned jeweler in New York whom he called the No. 1 grill person in the world. "He's from Israel but moved to New York and couldn't get his license," Mr. Gvasalia said. "He started to see rappers wearing the golden teeth, but the quality was horrible, so he said 'Oh, I'll make it properly for you.' He does grills for Pharrell, Madonna."
Mr. Gvasalia designed his to match his watches: a white and rose gold set to go with his white and rose gold Patek Nautilus. He likes the grills because they are not permanent, but, he said, "they add to the look, especially in summer, when you just have a T-shirt on."
During the January men's collections, show goers began noticing Mr. Gvasalia everywhere: in front rows and at clubs, in Daily Mail celebrity gossip columns holding hands with Avril Lavigne. He is friends with J Balvin, whom he met about a year ago when Mr. Balvin DM'd him on Instagram. Now, Mr. Balvin said, they text almost every day and "spend hours talking about fashion, watches, music and traveling -- gossiping."
Still, he often works until 5 or 6 in the morning, returning again at 10 a.m. His most recent show was the second most viewed spring 2024 men's collection on Voguerunway.com, coming in just after Vuitton and just before Prada. Mr. Gvasalia is, Vogue wrote, "on a roll." (Not long after, Beyoncé posted a photo of herself on Instagram in a pair of Vetements jeans.) According to Freddy Barassi, the vice president for men's wear at Ssense, it has stocked Vetements since 2015 and seen double-digit growth each season.
Next year will be Vetements' 10th anniversary. Mr. Gvasalia has plans. They are, characteristically, not small.
"Looking at people my age now, I'm not sure who is the competition," he said. "I had dinner yesterday with Sam Worthington. You know, the actor from 'Avatar.' I said, 'Sam, do you think you've had your biggest movie yet?' and he said, 'No, I think it's still coming.' And I feel for me, there is still something coming very big. I would not take a job today somewhere else. But one day if Chanel comes? I would not say no."

Higher Tech Raises Cost To Fix Cars: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: More technology and creature comforts, as well as a parade of new electric vehicles, have complicated the job after accidents.
New cars and trucks are packed with sensors and technology that protect and pamper drivers and passengers. But those features are also raising the cost of repairs after accidents.
The average cost of making damaged cars good as new has soared 36 percent since 2018, and may top $ 5,000 by the end of this year, according to Mitchell, a company that provides data and software to insurance companies and auto repair businesses. That big increase is the main reason that insurance premiums have been soaring -- up 17 percent in the 12 months through May.
New sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, including a rapidly growing number of electric models, have become so complex and luxurious that seemingly simple repairs can cost a small fortune, auto experts said. Insurers are often on the hook for much of those costs, leading them to raise their rates.
Materials designed to crumple or deform in a crash to protect pedestrians or passengers, for example, can be hard or impossible to repair. Many bumpers must be replaced after low-speed dings because the safety sensors embedded in them may no longer work properly after repairs. Other systems, even some that do not appear to be damaged, must be inspected or recalibrated.
"The modern digital architecture is so advanced that systems beyond point of impact are being disrupted," said Ryan Mandell, director of claims performance for Mitchell. "Getting a car back to pre-loss condition is harder than at any point in history, and will only become more challenging."
Industry experts have been particularly focused on the cost of repairing electric cars and trucks, which aren't built like gasoline cars and have different parts. In addition, many mechanics aren't trained to work on them. In recent months, news reports and stories shared on social media about astronomical repair bills for electric cars and trucks have captured the attention of car enthusiasts.
Consider the case of Chris Apfelstadt and his Rivian R1T pickup truck, which was rear-ended by a Lexus in February at a stoplight in Columbus, Ohio, while he was driving and his infant son was in the back seat.
The damage was initially deemed relatively minor, and the other driver's insurer offered him $ 1,600. The actual cost to fix the bumper at a business certified to repair Rivian vehicles -- one of just three in Ohio -- was $ 42,000, roughly half the truck's selling price.
"I expected it to be expensive," said Mr. Apfelstadt, who owns a lighting company, "but it was still a shocking number."
A key reason is that the accident damaged a sleek panel that extends from the truck's rear to front roof pillars. Repairing and repainting it set off a cascade of pricey work, including removing the interior ceiling material, known as the headliner, and front windshield.
Some of the cost probably also had to do with Rivian's small size and youth. Like other auto start-ups, the company, which is based in Irvine, Calif., and delivered its first vehicles to customers in 2021, does not sell through franchised dealers and has had to build an independent repair network from scratch.
Ford Motor has 2,800 North American dealers equipped to repair its electric vehicles, along with a vast network of independent shops and aftermarket suppliers. Rivian has certified about 200 North American collision shops.
"It's a challenge that we're newer to market," said Noe Mejia, Rivian's vice president of service operations. But, he added, Rivian's smaller scale and lack of bureaucracy allow it to work directly with customers and shops to ensure repairs meet high standards.
Mr. Apfelstadt's story was discussed extensively on the internet. To some people, accounts such as his, and harrowing tales of cars totaled after minor accidents shared online by some owners of Tesla cars, have become cautionary tales about the financial perils of owning electric cars.
Auto experts acknowledge that repairing electric models is more expensive on average than repairing gasoline vehicles. But a fuller analysis of claims and repair data shows that electric vehicle repair costs are not markedly higher than costs for gasoline cars of similar age and price, and that they're sometimes less.
"The idea that E.V.s are being totaled left and right is the horror story that keeps insurers up at night," Mr. Mandell said. "Has that happened? Yes. But the incidents are few and far between."
Data from Mitchell shows that in 2022 electric vehicles cost about $ 6,800 on average to fix after accidents, about $ 2,400 more than the average for all cars. Battery-powered cars tend to require more expensive parts, the company said, and repairing them takes more time and may require work by specialist mechanics.
But a big reason electric cars tend to cost much more to repair, at first glance, is that most of them are newer luxury models. Tesla's cars, which sell for between $ 40,000 and around $ 110,000, account for 75 percent of collision claims for battery-powered models.
Fixing electric vehicles from mainstream brands such as Hyundai or Nissan costs only about $ 800 more than their gasoline counterparts, according to Mitchell. And in the premium segment, typical repair costs for battery-powered and gasoline vehicles are roughly the same, around $ 7,000, for model years 2018 and later.
Other data suggests that electric vehicles fare relatively well. About 18 percent of gasoline cars involved in crashes are totaled, while only about 6 percent of battery-powered vehicles are deemed unrepairable after accidents, according to Mitchell.
Matt Moore, a senior vice president at the Highway Loss Data Institute, a research organization that serves the insurance industry, said insurance and repair data undercut the idea that batteries or electric technology racked up burdensome repair costs. For 11 models that are available in gasoline and electric versions -- including the Hyundai Kona and Volvo XC40 -- repair costs for the electric models are just 2 percent higher, according to the institute's analysis.
Gasoline or electric, Mr. Moore said, more expensive, rare and higher-performing cars tend to be involved in fewer but more severe accidents in part because they are more likely to be driven by people who speed and take other risks.
"They hit fast and hit hard," he said. "Every collision is a mix of man and machine."
But auto experts added that damage to the battery pack of electric cars -- their most expensive part -- could make them harder to repair, requiring special tools and advanced training.
"Right now, if there's serious damage to the pack, nobody is anxious to take a shot at repairing that," said Sandy Munro, an engineer and consultant who hosts a popular YouTube show on which he has interviewed Elon Musk, the Tesla chief executive, and others in the auto industry.
Automakers say they are aware of rising repair costs and are working to make cars easier to fix, especially electric vehicles, which many executives expect to replace most or all gasoline models in the coming decades.
BMW has equipped its electric vehicles with sensors that provide data on crash-force direction and intensity. That information can guide technicians on which battery modules need replacement. Ford has made it so its dealers can replace a damaged battery tray on the Mustang Mach-E and swap all components into a new tray. General Motors is developing a process to let dealers repair and replace packs, including individual battery modules that are damaged.
Even though repair costs are climbing, Mr. Munro emphasized that newer cars provided significant benefits over older vehicles. They can absorb horrifying crash forces and let occupants walk away. Or they avoid collisions entirely, using the same cameras and sensors that make for trickier repairs.
"If nobody dies but we can't fix that bumper, I don't care about that," he said. "It's only scrap iron. The focus is rightly on the people inside and the efficiency of the car."

New cars and trucks are packed with sensors and technology that protect and pamper drivers and passengers. But those features are also raising the cost of repairs after accidents.
The average cost of making damaged cars good as new has soared 36% since 2018, and may top $5,000 by the end of this year, according to Mitchell, a company that provides data and software to insurance companies and auto repair businesses. That big increase is the main reason that insurance premiums have been soaring — up 17% in the 12 months through May.
New SUVs and pickup trucks, including a rapidly growing number of electric models, have become so complex and luxurious that seemingly simple repairs can cost a small fortune, auto experts said. Insurers are often on the hook for much of those costs, leading them to raise their rates.
Materials designed to crumple or deform in a crash to protect pedestrians or passengers, for example, can be hard or impossible to repair. Many bumpers must be replaced after low-speed dings because the safety sensors embedded in them may no longer work properly after repairs. Other systems, even some that do not appear to be damaged, must be inspected or recalibrated.
“The modern digital architecture is so advanced that systems beyond point of impact are being disrupted,” said Ryan Mandell, director of claims performance for Mitchell. “Getting a car back to pre-loss condition is harder than at any point in history, and will only become more challenging.”
Industry experts have been particularly focused on the cost of repairing electric cars and trucks, which aren’t built like gasoline cars and have different parts. In addition, many mechanics aren’t trained to work on them. In recent months, news reports and stories shared on social media about astronomical repair bills for electric cars and trucks have captured the attention of car enthusiasts.
Consider the case of Chris Apfelstadt and his Rivian R1T pickup truck, which was rear-ended by a Lexus in February at a stoplight in Columbus, Ohio, while he was driving and his infant son was in the back seat.
The damage was initially deemed relatively minor, and the other driver’s insurer offered him $1,600. The actual cost to fix the bumper at a business certified to repair Rivian vehicles — one of just three in Ohio — was $42,000, roughly half the truck’s selling price.
“I expected it to be expensive,” said Apfelstadt, who owns a lighting company, “but it was still a shocking number.”
A key reason is that the accident damaged a sleek panel that extends from the truck’s rear to front roof pillars. Repairing and repainting it set off a cascade of pricey work, including removing the interior ceiling material, known as the headliner, and front windshield.
Some of the cost probably also had to do with Rivian’s small size and youth. Like other auto startups, the company, which is based in Irvine, California, and delivered its first vehicles to customers in 2021, does not sell through franchised dealers and has had to build an independent repair network from scratch.
Ford Motor has 2,800 North American dealers equipped to repair its electric vehicles, along with a vast network of independent shops and aftermarket suppliers. Rivian has certified about 200 North American collision shops.
“It’s a challenge that we’re newer to market,” said Noe Mejia, Rivian’s vice president of service operations. But, he added, Rivian’s smaller scale and lack of bureaucracy allow it to work directly with customers and shops to ensure repairs meet high standards.
Apfelstadt’s story was discussed extensively on the internet. To some people, accounts such as his, and harrowing tales of cars totaled after minor accidents shared online by some owners of Tesla cars, have become cautionary tales about the financial perils of owning electric cars.
Auto experts acknowledge that repairing electric models is more expensive on average than repairing gasoline vehicles. But a fuller analysis of claims and repair data shows that electric vehicle repair costs are not markedly higher than costs for gasoline cars of similar age and price, and that they’re sometimes less.
“The idea that EVs are being totaled left and right is the horror story that keeps insurers up at night,” Mandell said. “Has that happened? Yes. But the incidents are few and far between.”
Data from Mitchell shows that in 2022 electric vehicles cost about $6,800 on average to fix after accidents, about $2,400 more than the average for all cars. Battery-powered cars tend to require more expensive parts, the company said, and repairing them takes more time and may require work by specialist mechanics.
But a big reason electric cars tend to cost much more to repair, at first glance, is that most of them are newer luxury models. Tesla’s cars, which sell for between $40,000 and around $110,000, account for 75% of collision claims for battery-powered models.
Fixing electric vehicles from mainstream brands such as Hyundai or Nissan costs only about $800 more than their gasoline counterparts, according to Mitchell. And in the premium segment, typical repair costs for battery-powered and gasoline vehicles are roughly the same, around $7,000, for model years 2018 and later.
Other data suggests that electric vehicles fare relatively well. About 18% of gasoline cars involved in crashes are totaled, while only about 6% of battery-powered vehicles are deemed unrepairable after accidents, according to Mitchell.
Matt Moore, a senior vice president at the Highway Loss Data Institute, a research organization that serves the insurance industry, said insurance and repair data undercut the idea that batteries or electric technology racked up burdensome repair costs. For 11 models that are available in gasoline and electric versions — including the Hyundai Kona and Volvo XC40 — repair costs for the electric models are just 2% higher, according to the institute’s analysis.
Gasoline or electric, Moore said, more expensive, rare and higher-performing cars tend to be involved in fewer but more severe accidents in part because they are more likely to be driven by people who speed and take other risks.
“They hit fast and hit hard,” he said. “Every collision is a mix of man and machine.”
But auto experts added that damage to the battery pack of electric cars — their most expensive part — could make them harder to repair, requiring special tools and advanced training.
“Right now, if there’s serious damage to the pack, nobody is anxious to take a shot at repairing that,” said Sandy Munro, an engineer and consultant who hosts a popular YouTube show on which he has interviewed Elon Musk, the Tesla CEO, and others in the auto industry.
Automakers say they are aware of rising repair costs and are working to make cars easier to fix, especially electric vehicles, which many executives expect to replace most or all gasoline models in the coming decades.
BMW has equipped its electric vehicles with sensors that provide data on crash-force direction and intensity. That information can guide technicians on which battery modules need replacement. Ford has made it so its dealers can replace a damaged battery tray on the Mustang Mach-E and swap all components into a new tray. General Motors is developing a process to let dealers repair and replace packs, including individual battery modules that are damaged.
Even though repair costs are climbing, Munro emphasized that newer cars provided significant benefits over older vehicles. They can absorb horrifying crash forces and let occupants walk away. Or they avoid collisions entirely, using the same cameras and sensors that make for trickier repairs.
“If nobody dies but we can’t fix that bumper, I don’t care about that,” he said. “It’s only scrap iron. The focus is rightly on the people inside and the efficiency of the car.”

Tesla Sales Are Up 10% As Perks Fuel Demand: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Incentives and price cuts made Tesla electric cars cheaper than comparable gasoline models. But the company faces growing competition in China, a key market.
Tesla sales rose a better-than-expected 10 percent in the second quarter as the company led by Elon Musk benefited from government incentives and price cuts that made its electric cars less expensive than comparable gasoline models.
Tesla delivered 466,000 vehicles from April through June, up from 423,000 vehicles in the previous quarter, the company said on Sunday. Compared with a year earlier, sales in the second quarter rose 83 percent as the company expanded production at new factories in Austin, Texas, and near Berlin.
The sales figures exceeded estimates by Wall Street analysts and showed that Tesla was able to overcome the effect of higher interest rates, which raise monthly payments for people who buy cars on credit.
Tesla was the first of the automakers to report its sales numbers. Sales of most major car brands probably rose sharply in the last quarter, analysts say. Supply chain issues have improved, making it easier for carmakers to get the components they need and for buyers to find the cars they want. Analysts at Cox Automotive forecast that U.S. new vehicle sales will rise more than 8 percent this year from 2022.
Rules that took effect this year allowed buyers of Tesla vehicles to qualify for $ 7,500 in federal tax credits. With the credit, the least expensive Model 3 sedan sells for less than $ 33,000, cheaper than similar luxury sedans sold by Mercedes-Benz and BMW that run on gasoline and in line with mass market cars like the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.
Owners of electric cars also benefit from fuel savings and lower maintenance costs. Electric vehicles don't require oil changes, and electricity is generally cheaper per mile than gasoline.
Tesla is the dominant maker of electric cars in the United States, with a market share of 62 percent in the first quarter, according to Kelley Blue Book. But its share has slipped from more than 70 percent at the beginning of 2022 as established automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor and Volkswagen have begun offering more electric models.
In China, a bigger car market than the United States or Europe, Tesla faces intense competition from local manufacturers that have newer model lineups, like BYD. On average, electric vehicles by Chinese manufacturers have been in showrooms a bit more than a year, according to AlixPartners, a consulting firm. Tesla's most popular car, the Model Y sport utility vehicle, went on sale in 2020.
Chinese manufacturers also offer interior and exterior styling and entertainment and information systems that better cater to local tastes, AlixPartners noted, citing consumer surveys.
While Tesla sales have continued to climb, the company's profitability has suffered because it has had to cut prices to prop up demand. Tesla made $ 2.5 billion in the first quarter, down from $ 3.7 billion in the last three months of 2022.
Many investors are betting that Tesla's growth will accelerate as demand for electric vehicles grows, and the company begins selling the Cybertruck, an electric pickup truck, later this year. Tesla's agreement to let other carmakers, including Ford and G.M., use its charging network could also become a new source of revenue.
Tesla's share price has more than doubled this year although it remains well below its peak in 2021, when the company was worth more than $ 1 trillion.
The carmaker said on Sunday that it would publish its financial results for this year's second quarter on July 19.

VW Replaces Audi Chief Amid Pressure to Electrify: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The News
Volkswagen is replacing the chief executive at its luxury brand Audi, naming Gernot Döllner to take over from Markus Duesmann, as the company seeks to accelerate its transition to electric vehicles.
Mr. Döllner, who has served as Volkswagen's leading strategist, will start his new role on Sept. 1, Audi said in a statement on Thursday. Audi, although profitable, is struggling to convert to battery power and compete with the growing threat from Chinese carmakers.
Herbert Diess, Volkswagen's chief executive before Oliver Blume took over in September, brought Mr. Duesmann to Audi from BMW three years ago, with the hope that he could help the brand innovate and strengthen sales of its electric models.
The company's earnings grew 40 percent to 7.6 billion euros, or $ 8.3 billion, in 2022, thanks to a decision to prioritize its higher-end vehicles over more affordable cars as it worked through a chips shortage caused by the supply chain disruptions linked to the coronavirus pandemic.
Audi is now working on its final generation of combustion engine models and plans to bring 10 new electric models to its lineup, ahead of plans to produce only E.V.s beginning in 2026.
What It Means: Audi faces competition for electric vehicles.
Audi is Volkswagen's second-most-important luxury line, after Porsche. Although Porsche has successfully broken into the market for electric vehicles, Audi's strength has been the continued popularity of its combustion engine vehicles.
Now, the company faces stiff competition from the leading producers of electric vehicles, such as Tesla and Chinese automakers. Mr. Blume has said he expects the company to maintain 14 percent growth and wants to see Audi better coordinate its production with both VW and Porsche.
That will be easier with Mr. Döllner as the company's head, as he worked many years alongside Mr. Blume when both were top-level managers at Porsche, which like Audi is owned by the Volkswagen Group.
Mr. Döllner has been working at Volkswagen since 1993, while still earning his doctorate. He served as head of Porsche's four-door Panamera sedan series, which he helped develop.
What's Next: A focus on North America and China.
A main focus for Mr. Döllner will be to push ahead talks on opening a factory in North America. Audi's main competitors, BMW and Mercedes-Benz, both have production facilities in the United States, allowing them to produce nearly twice as many vehicles for that market. Audi's S.U.V.s are popular with U.S. drivers, and the company is looking at developing electric versions of several of its leading models.
In China, Audi's combustion engine vehicles remain popular, but the company needs to speed up production of electric vehicles if the brand is to remain competitive with popular local producers, including BYD and Chery.

No Uber, No Lyft: Neighbors Driving Neighbors: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: An innovative E.V. ride-sharing program is bringing low-cost clean transportation to an agricultural town in California's Central Valley. Others are following suit.
Three mornings a week, Herminia Ibarra makes her way to a fleet of sparkling electric vehicles lined up in a dusty alley alongside a former diesel repair shop. Of the five Chevy Bolts, three Tesla Ys, two Volkswagen e-Golfs and a BMW i3, she always tries to snag her favorite: the red Bolt set up with her Bluetooth. In this E.V., she will pick up the two retired farmworkers who are her regular clients and ferry them on two-lane roads to their dialysis appointments 20 miles away.
Ms. Ibarra is a raitera, a term for the practice of neighbors providing rides to community members in need. The shop, which has a Mexican flag wrapped around its staircase, is the nerve center of Green Raiteros, an E.V. ride-sharing initiative in Huron, Calif., that shuttles low-income residents, many of them elderly, to medical appointments for free.
Ms. Ibarra, behind the wheel of the red Bolt, is what its proponents call "mobility justice" in action: an effort to address the reality that low-income communities most affected by pollution from diesel trucks, highways and other sources have had the least access to zero-emission vehicles.
Enter the Green Raiteros. Born of a lack of public transit, a concern for the environment and stubborn resolve, the program was masterminded by the Latino Equity Advocacy & Policy Institute, a nonprofit founded by Rey León, Huron's mayor.
Similar efforts are underway elsewhere in California, New York and other areas, along with a growing push in Washington, D.C., to subsidize E.V. programs. Under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the federal government is providing $ 700 million in grants to local governments to set up charging infrastructure in underserved areas.
The goal of all these initiatives is to give more people in low-income communities access to cleaner forms of transportation. In Huron, the result of the local effort is 30 charging stations placed strategically around the city, among other projects aimed at lowering carbon emissions in the area.
Ringed by vast acres of garlic and tomato fields, Huron is a small agricultural city in "the Heart of the Valley," as a sign on the main road into town announces. Of Huron's 6,200 residents, 95 percent are Latino and about 50 percent are immigrants. And despite being just 50 miles from Fresno, the state's fifth largest city, Huron is too remote for Uber or Lyft to operate.
Mr. León has referred to the tradition of ride sharing in Latino communities as "Indigenous Ubers." He is the son of a migrant worker brought to the U.S. under the Bracero program that ran from 1942 to 1964, and a graduate of University of California, Berkeley. The emotional resonance of ride-sharing came early: When Mr. León was a child, his uncle worked as a raitero. "He was a tall man with a big sombrero and a tiny car -- a green Pinto," he recalled. "He was like Curious George with the Man with the big Yellow Hat. Big guy, small car."
When Mr. León's uncle wasn't available, the family's transit options were limited. Mr. León remembers that he and his mother had to take the county bus to visit a critically injured cousin in the hospital some 55 miles away, an exhausting three-and-a-half-hour journey with at least 16 stops.
For Mr. León, the ordeal from his youth laid the groundwork for Green Raiteros. Electric vehicles that usually zip around the dappled hills of wealthy Malibu or Marin County are now accessible to "maintainers of the food chain," as Mr. León describes his majority farmworker residents.
Huron's average household income is $ 35,000, and many people, Mr. León said, spend 30 to 40 percent of their monthly wages on gas-powered cars that frequently break down. Residents breathe air consistently ranked as some of the country's worst.
"Like affordable housing, mobility and transportation are a basic human right," said Ethan Elkind, director of the climate program for the Center for Law, Energy & the Environment at University of California Berkeley law school. In low-income, ecologically vulnerable areas like Huron, he said that it often requires multiple sources of public funding to get the necessary infrastructure up and running -- charging stations especially -- including staff to apply for the grants in the first place.
Mr. León launched Green Raiteros in 2018 with private foundation money and half a million dollars from the settlement of a legal case between NRG Energy and the California Public Utilities Commission. The Teslas were courtesy of a $ 1 million grant from the California Air Resources Board, the state air quality regulator charged with developing programs to fight climate change. (A statute requires that at least 35 percent of certain climate investment projects benefit low-income communities and households.) The $ 150,000 annual operating budget is largely a mix of funding from the air board, state agencies and philanthropies, supplemented by a recent contribution from General Motors."It's always about playing catch-up," Mr. León said.
Tax credits and consumer rebates for purchasing E.V.s tend to be of little use for people for whom owning a car is a significant financial hurdle. "Owning a car is a poverty perpetuator," Mr. León observed, sitting in the Green Raiteros dispatch center behind the faded brown stucco colonnades of the main street.
Ms. Ibarra, like some Green Raiteros drivers, started out as a client. Her husband, Victor Garcia, worked as an agricultural truck driver and needed access to the sole family car, so Ms. Ibarra relied on raiteros to get around. Gregorio Hernandez, 69, one of her regulars and a retired farmworker, was an original "green raitero" but became unable to drive after two strokes. He usually rides in Ms. Ibarra's Bolt along with Enrique Contreras, a fellow dialysis patient who said it would otherwise cost $ 40 a day to pay someone to drive him.
Ms. Ibarra's route to the dialysis center is a slice of Central Valley life, bisecting miles of pistachio and almond orchards, and cotton fields shedding fluff along the shoulders. She passes local employers like a major state prison and the sweltering tomato paste processing plant where she used to work. In the car, the three chitchat about what's growing, the job scene in the fields and, of course, the weather. Ms. Ibarra always waits for the two men to finish their dialysis appointments, then drives them home.
She cares about the planet but likes E.V.s chiefly because she hates pumping gas, she said. She tracks mileage on her iPhone, pulling up to a charger at day's end. At night, the program's cars reside behind a chain-link fence guarded by two pit bulls, Princess and Puki.
"It's important because many people don't drive, don't have cars and there is nobody to take them," Ms. Ibarra said. "They are all farmworkers and would have to lose a day of work."
Green Raitero's clients, about 120 in total, either sign up for rides in advance or just wander into the former repair shop. Many "still have old-fashioned flip phones," said David Mercado, the dispatcher and a longtime driver. "They can call day or night. We're a tight community."
Inventive models for E.V. ride sharing are flourishing elsewhere, from rural, unincorporated communities outside Fresno to a new car-sharing program bringing E.V.s to affordable housing complexes in eight states. A pioneering public-private effort in Los Angeles, BlueLA powered by Blink Mobility, began in 2015 with funding from California Air Resources Board and the city's Department of Water and Power. It offers car sharing at discounted rates for low-income members: $ 1 per month for membership and 15 cents a minute in rental fees.
At Rancho San Pedro, a largely Latino public housing complex abutting the heavily polluted, highly trafficked Port of Los Angeles, residents campaigned for a $ 100,000 state-funded pilot launched by the nonprofit Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator to bring two electric vehicles and charging stations to this transportation desert more than 20 miles from downtown.
The communal Nissan Leafs, renting for $ 5 an hour, have been a hit with residents, with prime time starting at 6 a.m. for school drop-offs. "If the car breaks down, you don't have to repair it," said Maria Montes, who coaches others on how to use the E.V. sharing program.
Other E.V. pilots, like the nonprofit Miocar, based at affordable housing developments throughout the Central Valley, have relied on public investments.
The most far-reaching concept is the country's first municipally owned car share, in Minneapolis and Saint Paul, Minn., a fleet of 170 electric vehicles and 70 charging spots covering a 35 square-mile area with a high concentration of poverty. Evie Carshare debuted last year, subsidized by $ 7 million in federal grants, $ 4 million from Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy Inc. and funding from both cities.
But collectively, these nonprofit programs face broader hurdles. Because they offer below-market pricing, their long-term financial sustainability and ability to scale up can be uncertain. "It's an inversion of the dominant car-sharing model, which is a for-profit operation in affluent urban areas with high-quality transit," said Caroline Rodier, associate director of the Urban Land Use and Transportation Center at UC Davis, who has studied Miocar and rural car sharing.
Obtaining auto insurance can also be a struggle, said Creighton Randall, the chief executive of the Mobility Development Group, which specializes in launching such projects.
Ithaca Carshare in upstate New York, which has operated for 15 years with 30 cars and 1,500 members, recently went on hiatus after the two remaining private insurers of car sharing left the New York market. Last week, the state passed legislation allowing nonprofits to pool insurance, allowing programs like the one in Ithaca to secure affordable plans and continue operating.
And in Cantua Creek, Calif., a tiny Central Valley town (population 471), the much-anticipated arrival of four E.V.s and six chargers in November 2019 through a state program was short-lived. The cars were put on hold at the start of the pandemic and later unceremoniously removed.
Poetically named "Van Y Vienen" (meaning "they come and go"), community members could volunteer as drivers through an app set up by Green Commuter, a private ride-sharing company. For residents like Rosario Rodriguez, 47, who lives in neighboring Three Rocks and does not drive, this was a huge relief.
The $ 1.9 million project included $ 749,800 in California air board funding. Its demise "speaks to the larger issue of how we invest in public transit that goes beyond traditional projects," said Veronica Garibay, co-executive director of Leadership Counsel for Justice & Accountability, a legal and social justice organization that works with low-income, rural communities.
The cars provided residents with a fleeting glimpse of independence. "They were rides with people I could trust," Ms. Rodriguez said, citing easy trips to her mammograms, dental appointments and food shopping in Fresno, 50 miles away. "Then one day, the cars were gone."
"To tell you the truth, I just feel helpless and disappointed," she said. "It's not a privilege or a luxury to have a form of transportation. It is a need."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Over-the-top locations and characters bathed in red light recall an all but dead genre that was once a staple of late-night cable: the erotic thriller.
A slick executive drives a cherry red convertible.
A nightclub owner carries a coke spoon and wears his hair in a rat tail.
A troubled pop star masturbates while choking herself.
Those images might have come from an erotic thriller made by Brian De Palma, Paul Verhoeven or Adrian Lyne, directors who were prominent in the 1980s and 1990s thanks to movies like "Body Double" (Mr. De Palma), "Basic Instinct" (Mr. Verhoeven) and "9 ½ Weeks" (Mr. Lyne).
But those scenes were actually part of "The Idol," the HBO series that made its debut on Sunday with the apparent intention of reviving an all but dead genre.
Filled with close-up shots of luxury goods and body parts, "The Idol" also recalled the works of lesser filmmakers whose R-rated creations populated the late-night lineups of HBO and its rivals long before the advent of prestige television.
It was a style that died out over the years -- the death blow might have been Mr. Verhoeven's infamous "Showgirls," an expensive 1995 flop -- and seemed highly unlikely to make a return to the cultural stage amid the #MeToo movement.
As Karina Longworth, the creator of the film-history podcast "You Must Remember This," recently observed, today's films are so devoid of steamy sex scenes that they "would pass the sexual standard set by the strict censorship of the Production Code of the 1930s."
The old aesthetic was on full display in the first moments of "The Idol," a series created by Sam Levinson, Abel Tesfaye (known as the Weeknd) and Reza Fahim, three men who came of age when flipping through cable channels late at night was a frequent pastime for adolescent boys.
The first episode begins with the pop star Jocelyn, played by Lily-Rose Depp, baring her breasts during a photo shoot as a team of handlers, crew members and an ineffectual intimacy coordinator look on.
Later, Ms. Depp's character smokes in a sauna, rides in the back of a Rolls-Royce convertible and rubs up against a man she has just met (a club owner portrayed by Mr. Tesfaye) on a dance floor bathed in smoky red light. There will be no flannel PJs for Joss; a pair of wake-up scenes make it clear to viewers that she sleeps in a thong.
It isn't only the show's gratuitous nudity that harks back to Mr. Lyne and company, but the overall look and mood, which recall a louche glamour from the time of boxy Armani suits and cocaine nights. A main setting is a $ 70 million mansion in Bel Air that looks like something out of Mr. De Palma's "Scarface" but is in fact Mr. Tesfaye's real-life home.
A number of young viewers have said they find sex scenes embarrassing, but Mr. Levinson, who created the HBO drama "Euphoria," and his fellow producers have made no secret of their desire to pay homage to the heyday of Cinemax (when it had the nickname Skinemax).
A wink to viewers comes when Joss, in the darkness of her private screening room, watches "Basic Instinct." And then there is the pulsating score, which seems to conjure Tangerine Dream, the German electronic group who scored the sex scene on a train in "Risky Business." In another nod to the show's influences, the cast includes Elizabeth Berkley, the star of "Showgirls."
While it may seem like an outlier, "The Idol" has seemingly tapped into a cultural moment that would have seemed unthinkable just a few years ago: Ms. Longworth recently devoted a season of her film-history podcast to the "Erotic '80s"; no less a tastemaker than the Criterion Channel has recently presented a series on erotic thrillers from the same time period; and last month in Los Angeles, the American Cinematheque held a screening of "Basic Instinct."
"The Idol" also has a close competitor in the world of streaming: "Fatal Attraction," a 1987 hit for Mr. Lyne, has been rebooted as a series on Paramount+.
Stephanie Zacharek, the film critic for Time, suggested that the return of such fare may have arisen from the yearslong glut of comic book movies, along with the lack of a certain kind of R-rated film that was once all the rage for adult viewers.
"In the '80s, that's almost all there was in the multiplex," Ms. Zacharek said. "Grown-ups went to see those movies. Now we don't even have that many movies for grown-ups, period."
Ms. Zacharek slammed "The Idol" in her review and in a phone interview -- "It feels like it was made by someone who has never had sex," she said -- but she said she was a fan of "Body Double" (and even "Showgirls") and laments the disappearance of that kind of thing.
"I always enjoyed those films, even when I thought they were sexist or ridiculous," Ms. Zacharek said. "They do have a certain element of glamour to them."
It is a distinct possibility that the idea of reviving this particular genre may appeal more to Mr. Levinson and his colleagues than audiences and critics.
After a two-decade absence from big-budget productions, Mr. Lyne attempted a comeback last year with "Deep Water," an erotic thriller starring Ana de Armas and Ben Affleck. Mr. Levinson was one of the film's writers.
"Deep Water," which streamed on Hulu upon its release, was never shown in theaters. It drew a 36 percent approval score from critics and a 24 percent audience score on the review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes.
"The Idol" has fared both better and worse: A mere 24 percent of critics have given it a thumbs-up, and 63 percent of audience members have weighed in favorably.

U.S. Battery Subsidies Put Allies on Edge: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The European Union is trying to assemble the building blocks to produce electric cars, but subsidies are luring companies to the United States.
European leaders complained for years that the United States was not doing enough to fight climate change. Now that the Biden administration has devoted hundreds of billions of dollars to that cause, many Europeans are complaining that the United States is going about it the wrong way.
That new critique is born of a deep fear in Germany, France, Britain and other European countries that Washington's approach will hurt the allies it ought to be working with, luring away much of the new investments in electric car and battery factories not already destined for China, South Korea and other Asian countries.
That concern is the main reason some European leaders, including Germany's second-highest-ranking official, Robert Habeck, have beaten a path to Vasteras, a city about 60 miles from Stockholm that is best known for a Viking burial mound and a Gothic cathedral.
Officials have been traveling there to court one of Europe's few homegrown battery companies, Northvolt. Led by a former Tesla executive, Northvolt is a small player in the global battery industry, but European leaders are offering it hundreds of millions of euros to build factories in Europe. Mr. Habeck visited in February to lobby the company to push ahead on its plan to build a factory near Hamburg, Germany. The company had considered postponing to invest in the United States instead.
"It's definitely attractive to be in America right now," Emma Nehrenheim, Northvolt's chief environmental officer, said in an interview last month in Vasteras. Northvolt declined to comment in detail on the discussions about the Hamburg plant, which the company committed to in May.
The tussle over Northvolt's plans is an example of the intense and, some European officials say, counterproductive competition between the United States and Europe as they try to acquire the building blocks of electric vehicle manufacturing to avoid becoming dependent on China, which dominates the battery supply chain.
Auto experts said that the tax credits and other incentives offered by President Biden's main climate policy, the Inflation Reduction Act, had siphoned some investment from Europe and put pressure on European countries to offer their own incentives.
The United States has provoked a "massive subsidy race," Cecilia Malmstrom, a former European trade commissioner, said during a panel discussion last month at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. She called on leaders to "jointly invest in the green transition and not compete against each other."
Biden officials have argued that U.S. and European policies are complementary. They have noted that the government and private money going into electric cars and batteries would lower prices for car buyers and put more emission-free vehicles on the road.
U.S. officials add that construction of battery factories and plants to process lithium and other materials is booming on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
Efforts by governments to promote electric vehicles "will spur a degree of technological innovation and cost cutting that will be beneficial not only to Europe and the United States, but to the global economy and to our global effort to meet the challenge that climate change presents," Wally Adeyemo, the deputy Treasury secretary, said in a recent interview.
The Biden administration has also been talking with European officials about allowing cars made from European battery materials and components to qualify for U.S. tax credits. And the administration has interpreted the I.R.A., which Mr. Biden signed in August, to leave room for producers in Europe and elsewhere to benefit.
"You're seeing less of a concern from Europe that those companies may be lured away from Europe to America," said Abigail Wulf, who directs the Center for Critical Minerals Strategy at SAFE, a nonprofit organization.
Still, the law has forced European leaders to put new industrial policies in place.
In March, the European Commission, the administrative arm of the European Union, proposed the Critical Raw Materials Act, legislation to ensure supplies of lithium, nickel and other battery materials. One piece of the legislation calls for the E.U. to process at least 40 percent of the raw materials that the car industry needs within its own borders. The 27-nation alliance has also let countries provide more financial support to suppliers and manufacturers.
The money that the United States and Europe are pouring into electric vehicles will encourage sales, said Julia Poliscanova, a senior director at Transport & Environment, an advocacy group in Brussels. The legislation, which will need the approval of the European Parliament and the leaders of E.U. countries, would also bring some coherence to the fragmented policies of national governments, she said.
But Ms. Poliscanova added that European and U.S. policies risk canceling each other out. "Because everyone is scaling up at the same time, it's a zero-sum game," she said.
Business executives have complained that applying for financial aid in Europe is bureaucratic and slow. The Inflation Reduction Act, with its emphasis on tax credits, is simpler and faster, said Tom Einar Jensen, chief executive of the battery maker Freyr, which is building a factory in Mo i Rana, in northern Norway, and has plans to construct more plants in Finland and near Atlanta.
The I.R.A. has prompted "a dramatic increase in uptick in interest for batteries produced in the U.S.," Mr. Jensen said in an interview.
The future of European auto manufacturing is at stake, particularly for German companies. Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen have already lost market share in China to local automakers like BYD. Chinese automakers, including BYD and SAIC, are also making inroads in Europe. Selling cars under the British brand MG, SAIC has amassed 5 percent of the European electric vehicle market, putting it ahead of Toyota and Ford in that fast-growing segment.
European carmakers are frantically trying to build the supply chains they need to churn out electric vehicles.
In France, President Emmanuel Macron wants to convert a northern region where factory jobs have been in decline into a hub of battery production.
On Tuesday, Automotive Cells Company, a joint venture between Stellantis, Mercedes-Benz and TotalEnergies, inaugurated a factory in Billy-Berclau Douvrin, France, that aims to produce 300,000 electric batteries annually by the end of 2024. A.C.C. also plans to invest a total of 7.3 billion euros, or $ 7.8 billion, in Europe, including opening factories in Germany and in Italy, a deal sealed with 1.3 billion euros in public aid.
In Salzgitter, Germany, some 25 miles from Volkswagen's headquarters, steel beams tower above concrete foundations as excavators and dump trucks hum nearby. In a matter of months, the outlines of a battery factory have risen out of a field.
Volkswagen hopes to have battery-making machines installed before the end of the summer. By 2025, the automaker aims to produce battery cells for up to 500,000 electric vehicles a year -- a timeline that the company said was possible only because the factory was being built on land it owned.
Volkswagen is also building a factory in Ontario, but the company made the decision to do so only after the Canadian government matched U.S. incentives.
In Guben, a small city on Germany's border with Poland, Rock Tech Lithium, a Canadian company, is building a plant to process lithium ore. Mercedes has an agreement with Rock Tech to supply lithium to its battery producers.
These projects won't reach full production for several years. Recently, the Guben site was an open field. The only construction activity was a truck that dumped loads of crushed rock, making an ear-piercing screech.
Europe has some advantages, including a strong demand for electric cars: About 14 percent of new cars sold in the E.U. in the first three months of this year were battery powered, according to Schmidt Automotive Research, twice as many as in the United States.
But if Europe doesn't move quickly to aid the battery industry, "you will really lose momentum on the ground versus the North American market," said Dirk Harbecke, chief executive of Rock Tech.
Chinese battery companies have largely avoided the United States for fear of a political backlash. But Chinese battery firms have announced investments in Europe worth $ 17.5 billion since 2018, according to the Mercator Institute for China Studies and the Rhodium Group.
Political tension between Western governments and China has put German carmakers in a delicate position. They do not want to be overly dependent on Chinese supplies, but they cannot afford to displease the Chinese government.
BMW, Volkswagen and Volvo plan to buy cells from a factory in Arnstadt, Germany, run by CATL, a Chinese company that is currently the world's largest maker of electric vehicle batteries.
To balance their reliance on Chinese suppliers, European executives and leaders are keen to work with Northvolt, whose chief executive, Peter Carlsson, oversaw Tesla's supply chain for more than four years.
Northvolt wants to control all the steps of making batteries, including refining lithium and recycling old cells. That should help Europe achieve supply chain independence and ensure that batteries are produced in the most environmentally responsible way possible, said Ms. Nehrenheim, who is also a member of the Northvolt management board. "We're de-risking Europe," she said.
The company develops manufacturing techniques at its complex in Vasteras. Northvolt's first full-scale factory, at a site in Sweden 125 miles south of the Arctic Circle chosen for its abundant hydropower, is the size of the Pentagon. Northvolt also plans to build a U.S. factory, but has not yet announced a site.
Still, the company is ramping up production and is not among the world's top 10 battery suppliers, according to SNE Research, a consulting firm. And construction on its Hamburg plant is on hold until E.U. officials approve German subsidies.

Full text: The online influencer, popular with young men, is facing charges of human trafficking and rape, after seeking out a place where "corruption is accessible to everybody."
Andrew Tate, a pugilistic online influencer and self-crowned "king of toxic masculinity," never made any secret of why he had chosen Romania as his home and business base.
"I like living in a society where my money, my influence and my power mean that I'm not below or beholden" to any laws, Mr. Tate told his fans.
But, like much of what the former kickboxer has told his millions of mostly young male followers on social media -- including claims that he is a trillionaire and has 19 passports -- Mr. Tate's proclamation of faith in Romania as a risk-free haven for antisocial behavior reflected more fantasy than reality.
The Romanian authorities arrested Mr. Tate, a citizen of both the United States and Britain, and his younger brother, Tristan, in December on charges of human trafficking, rape and forming an organized criminal group. Held for three months in a jail in Bucharest, the capital, both men, who deny any wrongdoing, are now under house arrest, awaiting trial.
Their home is a sprawling compound down a dingy dead-end street in Voluntari, a town next to Bucharest that is dotted with shiny new office towers and derelict empty lots. It looks more like an industrial warehouse than the lair of a man who boasted of immense wealth and posted videos of himself hanging out in private jets with beautiful women and driving fast cars.
The high-end cars that once crowded the courtyard, including a Rolls-Royce, a Porsche, an Aston Martin and a BMW, are all gone, confiscated by the Romanian authorities. The only vehicle left is a clunky Russian Lada. It was not worth impounding.
Romania still ranks far below most fellow members of the European Union in clean-government rankings. In last year's Corruption Perceptions Index from Transparency International, only Bulgaria and Hungary were lower. And Romania, according to the State Department's 2022 report on human trafficking, remains "a primary source country for sex trafficking" in Europe.
But Romania has in recent years made a serious effort to tackle the endemic graft and general lawlessness that long blighted the country -- and that apparently attracted Mr. Tate. Before his arrest, he said he liked "living in countries where corruption is accessible to everybody," and where anybody can pay a $ 50 bribe to get out of a speeding ticket.
Eugen Vidineac, the Romanian lawyer defending Mr. Tate, said that his client had "said many stupid things," but that after his arrest, "he stopped thinking about Romania being so corrupt."
Since Mr. Tate established Romania as his base around 2016, the country's anti-trafficking agency has expanded its staff and launched a messaging blitz on billboards, television and online, warning women against "lover boys," traffickers who use seduction as a recruiting technique. Mr. Tate is accused of using this tactic to lure vulnerable women to his compound to perform in sex videos online.
The State Department report said that while Romania did "not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking," it was "making significant efforts to do so."
It cited legal changes, a sharp increase in the number of prosecutions for trafficking, stepped up cooperation with other European countries and the establishment in 2021 of a dedicated unit to combat sex trafficking by Romania's Organized Crime and Terrorism Investigation Directorate, the agency leading the investigation into Mr. Tate.
The directorate last year opened 1,246 new trafficking investigations, double the number in 2021.
Monica Boseff, the president of the Open Door Foundation, a private group that runs a shelter for women fleeing the sex trade, said that Mr. Tate was "not the only misogynist making creepy statements on social media related to women." But she said he had "miscalculated" in his belief that anything goes in Romania.
"We still have big problems that we need to solve, but there has been real improvement and we finally have hope" that the abuse and exploitation of women are slowly being seen by society and officials as crimes, Ms. Boseff said.
For Silvia Tabusca, a law lecturer at the Romanian-American University in Bucharest who has worked with prosecutors on trafficking cases, Mr. Tate's big mistake was not so much that he misjudged Romania's changing legal and social climate, but that he included a young American woman among his alleged victims.
Without pressure from the United States to investigate Mr. Tate, Ms. Tabusca said, "I'm not sure Romanian prosecutors would ever have touched him."
The United States Embassy in Bucharest, citing "privacy considerations," had no comment on whether the American authorities had intervened on behalf of a U.S. citizen. The Romanian agency leading the investigation also declined to comment.
Like Ms. Tabusca, Mr. Tate's lawyer attributed what he described as the unexpected zeal of the Romanian authorities against his client to American intervention, which he said had begun last year after the mother of a young woman from Florida started worrying that Mr. Tate had taken her daughter captive and asked the State Department to do something.
The mother's appeal, the lawyer said, led the American authorities to request help from Romania and prompted the opening of a criminal investigation in April last year -- soon after the daughter told her mother that she was in Romania and living in Mr. Tate's compound. Investigators bugged the compound, tapped his telephone, and monitored his movements and online communications.
The details of what they found are still secret and, according to the lawyer, who has access to the case file, provide no evidence of criminal wrongdoing, only of debauchery. "My client's problem," he said, "is his lifestyle. But lifestyle is not a crime. What matters is what is illegal, not what is immoral."
Mr. Tate, for his part, offered a characteristically melodramatic explanation for his arrest. A day after armed police officers stormed his compound, he told his followers on Twitter, who now number 6.6 million, that "the matrix sent their agents." The "matrix" is Mr. Tate's catchall designation for what he sees as a conspiracy by "woke" corporate elites, mainstream politicians and feminists to emasculate men.
Prosecutors accuse Mr. Tate of luring women to his compound and then putting them to work under duress as performers on pornographic webcams. The lawyer said that Mr. Tate's residence had no webcam studios and that his client had never coerced anyone into staying or working there. The Tate brothers, he said, "are famous; they are rich; they are young and beautiful," adding: "What would be their interest in forcing women to act as slaves?"
The only people living in the compound, the lawyer said, were the brothers and their various girlfriends. He acknowledged that some of the women had appeared in videos released by Mr. Tate, but said they had done so of their own free will in the hope that this would help them gain followers on social media. "He never took money from the girls," the lawyer said.
The now defunct website for one of Mr. Tate's business ventures -- an online academy offering a "Ph.D. Program" in "techniques for getting girls" -- gave a different story. It boasted that Mr. Tate "owns and operates strip clubs and webcam studios" and has "TOP QUALITY women living with him and making him money full time."
The sales pitch for the program, which charged more than $ 400 for enrollment, promised to teach students "how to build an army of women who are so loyal to you that they allow you to have as many girls as you want."
Two women whom prosecutors described as victims have insisted that they associated with Mr. Tate of their own accord and were not coerced. A clinical psychologist's report prepared as part of the case said they had been brainwashed into believing they had a genuine romantic relationship with Mr. Tate.
Ms. Boseff, the Open Door Foundation head, said that most of the more than 1,200 women who had passed through her group's shelter over the past decade had been entrapped by traffickers masquerading as "lover boys," and often felt affection and loyalty to them despite being pushed into working as prostitutes.
Mr. Tate, she said, understood that "everybody craves to be loved, to be cared for and to hear words of encouragement" -- needs that can make young women who have turbulent home lives particularly vulnerable to exploitation.
Statistics compiled by the anti-trafficking agency show that 74 percent of victims are recruited by acquaintances, friends, neighbors or even relatives.
Since his release from jail into house arrest at the end of March, Mr. Tate has recast himself as a philanthropist, claiming that he has set up a shelter for dogs, rebuilt a Romanian orphanage and is "going to save the world."
Unconvinced by his newfound commitment to good works, a Bucharest court on Friday extended the Tate brothers' house arrest for another month.
"Romania is not as corrupt as Tate had thought and hoped," said Mihaela Dragus, a police officer with Romania's National Agency Against Trafficking in Persons.

BUCHAREST, Romania — Andrew Tate, a pugilistic online influencer and self-crowned “king of toxic masculinity,” never made any secret of why he had chosen Romania as his home and business base.

VW Sells Russian Operations, Including an Assembly Plant: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The German automaker, which quit making cars in Russia after the invasion of Ukraine, said it had sold its plant to a local auto dealership chain.
Volkswagen has sold its assembly plant and other operations in Russia to a local auto dealership, more than a year after the German carmaker ceased production in the country following the invasion of Ukraine, the company said on Friday.
Under the deal, which required approval from the Russian government, a Moscow-based dealership called Avilon acquired the assets of Volkswagen Group Rus, the carmaker said. Neither company specified a sales price, but Russia media, citing local records, said Avilon had paid about 125 million euros ( $ 135 million).
Volkswagen made the announcement in a terse statement, and declined to comment further on the deal.
The move makes Volkswagen the latest European carmaker to withdraw from Russia in the past year, joining several hundred other multinational corporations leaving a market where many spent decades currying and constructing. But outrage over Moscow's war in Ukraine, combined with the difficulties coping with tough economic sanctions aimed at punishing Russia, has made the Russian market less attractive.
Mercedes-Benz announced last month that it had sold its Russia division, including an assembly plant, to Avtodom, a Russian investor, roughly a year after it suspended local manufacturing and the export of passenger cars and vans to Russia. The sale included a limited repurchase option, the company said, but it did not give any further details.
Last year, the French automaker Renault negotiated a deal with the Russian government to sell its 68 percent stake in AvtoVAZ, Russia's biggest carmaker, to NAMI, an automotive research institute in Moscow, for the price of 1 ruble, with the option of resuming business in the country at a future date.
Volkswagen declined to say whether the sale included a clause to return to Russia. In addition to its plant, in Kaluga, a city in western Russia, the Volkswagen sale included the company's components and leasing divisions.
Avilon did not comment on the sale, and it was not immediately clear what its plans were for the Kaluga plant.
Before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Avilon sold Volkswagen vehicles as well as dozens of other Western brands, including Mercedes, Jeep and Rolls-Royce. Since last year, it has also begun selling leading Chinese brands, such as Chery, Great Wall and Zeekr.
Volkswagen spent €774 million building the Kaluga plant, which opened in 2007. Two years later, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia flew in by helicopter to celebrate the start of full production of several of the company's best-selling models, as well as models from its Skoda line.
The plant had capacity to turn out 225,000 vehicles a year, nearly the number the company delivered to customers in Russia in 2021. Shortly after the invasion in February 2022, Volkswagen ceased operations at the plant. It also quit making cars at another plant, in Nizhny Novgorod, that was owned by the Russian company Gaz Group.
Gaz Group sued Volkswagen over the halt, seeking to freeze the German company's assets in Russia. Last month, a court ruled in Volkswagen's favor.
Over the past year, the Kaluga plant's 4,000 employees remained on the payroll as they waited for information on whether they would be allowed to return to work. The idle plant was a financial drain on Volkswagen, which is scrambling to expand its electric vehicle offerings and revamp its core brand. It is also losing ground to local brands in China, the world's largest auto market.
Observers believe that large companies waited for several months to gauge the situation before deciding whether to pull out of Russia. Large multinational companies that had spent several decades building supply chains and networks realized that the complexity and reach of those systems made it difficult to bring them to a swift halt, said Sebastian Hoppe, a political economist at Berlin's Free University who researches Russia.
"The more suppliers you have in Russia itself, the harder it is to pull out and the longer this whole process takes," Mr. Hoppe said.
Carmakers in Russia employed 300,000 people in 2021, according to the country's statistics agency, and up to 3.5 million more are estimated to work in related industries. Those jobs have been devastated over the past year, as auto production has dropped 77 percent in large part because Western firms have pulled up stakes.
Other firms are also deciding to turn their back on Russia. Henkel, a German maker of washing powder and other household products, and Ikea, the Swedish furniture company, sold their factories to local buyers in Russia this year.
The sale of factories and other assets may have come at a loss, but many Western companies do not expect Russia's economy to return to normal growth in the near future.
"What I think is also important, it is of course the case that the Russian market tends to be less attractive than it was before the war," Mr. Hoppe said.

Labor Victory in South With a Vote to Unionize: [National Desk]

Full text: Friday's victory by the United Steelworkers at a factory building electric school buses was a test for Democratic hopes that clean-energy funding from Washington could bolster organized labor.
Workers at a rural Georgia factory that builds electric school buses under generous federal subsidies voted to unionize on Friday, handing organized labor and Democrats a surprise victory in their hopes to turn huge new infusions of money from Washington into a union beachhead in the Deep South.
The company, Blue Bird in Fort Valley, Ga., may lack the cachet of Amazon or the ubiquity of Starbucks, two other corporations that have attracted union attention. But the 697-to-435 vote by Blue Bird's workers to join the United Steelworkers was the first significant organizing election at a factory receiving major federal funding under legislation signed by President Biden.
"This is just a bellwether for the future, particularly in the South, where working people have been ignored," Liz Shuler, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said Friday evening after the vote. "We are now in a place where we have the investments coming in and a strategy for lifting up wages and protections for a good high-road future."
The three bills making up that investment include a $ 1 trillion infrastructure package, a $ 280 billion measure to rekindle a domestic semiconductor industry and the Inflation Reduction Act, which included $ 370 billion for clean energy to combat climate change.
Each of the bills included language to help unions expand their membership, and Blue Bird's management, which opposed the union drive, had to contend with the Democrats' subtle assistance to the Steelworkers.
Blue Bird stands to benefit from the new federal funds. Last year, it hailed the $ 500 million that the Biden administration was providing through the infrastructure bill for the replacement of diesel-powered school buses with zero- and low-emission buses. Georgia school systems alone will get $ 51.1 million to buy new electric buses, but Blue Bird sells its buses across the country. Still more money will come through the Inflation Reduction Act, another law praised by the company.
But that money came with strings attached -- strings that subtly tilted the playing field toward the union. Just two weeks ago, for instance, the Environmental Protection Agency, which administers the Clean School Bus Program, pushed a demand on all recipients of federal subsidies to detail the health insurance, paid leave, retirement and other benefits they were offering their workers.
They also required the companies to have "committed to remain neutral in any organizing campaign and/or to voluntarily recognize a union based on a show of majority support." And under the rules of the infrastructure bill, no federal money may to be used to thwart a union election.
The Steelworkers union used the rules to its advantage. In late April, it filed multiple unfair labor practice charges against Blue Bird's management, citing $ 40 million in rebates the company had received from the E.P.A., which stipulated that those funds could not be used for anti-union activity.
"The rules say if workers want a union, you can't use any money to hire anti-union law firms, or use people to scare workers," Daniel Flippo, director of the Steelworkers district that covers the Southeast, said before the vote. "I'm convinced Blue Bird has done that."
Politicians also got involved. Georgia's two Democratic senators and southwestern Georgia's Democratic House member also subtly nudged the plant's management, in a union-hostile but politically pivotal state, to at least keep the election fair.
"I have been a longtime supporter of the USW and its efforts to improve labor conditions and living standards for workers in Georgia," the Democratic congressman, Representative Sanford Bishop, wrote of the United Steelworkers in an open letter to Blue Bird workers. "I want to encourage you in your effort to exercise your rights granted by the National Labor Relations Act."
Blue Bird's management minimized such pressure in its public statements, even as it fought hard to beat back union organizers.
"Although we respect and support the right for employees to choose, we do not believe that Blue Bird is better served by injecting a labor union into our relationship with employees," said Julianne Barclay, a spokeswoman for the company. "During the pending election campaign, we have voiced our opinion to our employees that a union is not in the best interest of the company or our employees."
Friday's union victory has the labor movement thinking big as the federal money continues to flow, and that could be good for Mr. Biden and other Democrats, especially in the pivotal state of Georgia.
"Workers at places like Blue Bird, in many ways, embody the future," Mr. Flippo said after the vote, adding, "For too long, corporations cynically viewed the South as a place where they could suppress wages and working conditions because they believed they could keep workers from unionizing."
The Blue Bird union shop, 1,400 workers strong, will be one of the biggest in the South, and union leaders said it could be a beachhead as they eyed new electric vehicle suppliers moving in -- and potentially the biggest, most difficult targets: foreign electric vehicle makers like Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz and BMW, which have located in Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina in part to avoid unions.
"Companies move there for a reason -- they want as smooth a path toward crushing unions as possible," said Steve Smith, a national spokesman for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "But we have federal money rolling in, a friendly administration and a chance to make inroads like we have never had before."
The Blue Bird plant, which rises suddenly off a rural highway lined with peach and pecan orchards, has long made it a practice to hire less educated workers, some of whom have prison records and most of whom start at $ 16 or $ 17 an hour, said Alex Perkins, a main organizer for the United Steelworkers in Georgia.
A union was a tough sell for such vulnerable workers against a management that was fiercely opposed, organizers conceded. Coming off the last shift of the day on Thursday, most workers declined to speak on the record. A clutch of about a dozen workers stood on Friday at the Circle K gas station across the street from the plant in the predawn darkness, holding pro-union signs as the first workers arrived to cast ballots under the gaze of National Labor Relations Board monitors.
But Cynthia Harden, who has worked at the plant for five years and voted in favor of organizing, did talk about the pressure workers were under to vote against it. Slide shows on the voting process, which showed ballots marked "no," said that the company could go broke if the union won, and there was a sudden appearance of food trucks at lunch and banners on the perimeter fence reading, "We Love Our Employees!"
"They've made some changes already, but if the union hadn't started, nothing would have happened," she said.
The letter that Georgia's Democratic senators, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, wrote to Matt Stevenson, Blue Bird's chief executive and president, was remarkably timid, praising the company for its cooperation and its well-paying jobs before "encouraging all involved, whatever their desired outcome, to make sure that the letter and the spirit of the National Labor Relations Act are followed."
Mr. Perkins fumed at that tone, considering the work that unions had put in to help Mr. Warnock win re-election last year. "I won't forget it next time," he said.
Both senators declined requests to comment on the election.

One Start-Up Thinks Text Messages Could Be Next Social Media: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Community, which was first marketed as a way for celebrities to text their fans, now has big brands on board.
Andrew here. You probably received today's DealBook newsletter, as you always do, by email. But you probably got a bunch of spam and junk mail in your inbox, too.
That's why so many of us are moving our most important communications to text messages. And in the process, the "text inbox" has become the new holy space for brands, far more intimate than your social media feed.
At least, that's the bet that Ashton Kutcher, the actor turned venture capitalist, and Guy Oseary, Bono's and Madonna's manager turned investor, made when they co-founded a text message company called Community in 2019. In the beginning, it was marketed to celebrities to communicate with their fans about tour dates and new projects.
But over the last year, the business has quietly grown to power text messages from some of the largest brands, like McDonald's, HBO, the New York Yankees and Condé Nast. When this month's Hollywood blockbuster, "The Super Mario Bros. Movie," launched an advertising campaign, it came with a phone number for viewers to text, powered by Community.
The company plans to announce next week that it has raised another $ 25 million, bringing its total fund-raising to $ 110 million, from investors such as Salesforce Ventures, Morgan Stanley Next Level Fund and Verizon Ventures. (It did not disclose its latest valuation.)
It also made Robert Wolf, a former chairman of UBS Group Americas, who served as an informal adviser to President Barack Obama, its new chairman. He started helping to sign up large corporate customers over the past year, bringing the total clients to over 8,000. The company is run by Diankha Linear, a longtime executive who served as an Army logistics and transportation officer.
Community has gained its latest funding as questions have increasingly arisen about social media's reach and how companies can own the digital relationship with their customers without a middleman like Facebook or Twitter.
"I started out with Twitter and built a fairly large following on Twitter," said Mr. Kutcher, who has 16.8 million followers. "But Twitter today is very different than what Twitter was when I originally started playing around it," he added. "The click-through rates are massively degraded -- the number of people that actually see the post is massively degraded."
At Community, in contrast, "we have like 45 percent click-through rates and 98 percent open rates," Mr. Kutcher said. "You don't get that in social environments because most people don't even see the things you're posting."
Community competes with a bevy of different types of services vying for space in your text inbox, from Attentive to Twilio to Zendesk. And many of the software platforms that companies use to manage their relationships with customers now have features that facilitate texting.
But what sets Community apart is the dialogue that celebrities and brands have with their customers, who provide troves of information about themselves, which the brand owns and isn't shared with Community's other clients.
Oseary was originally drawn to Community because of his role as a music manager, he said.
"I have no way to know who came to the concert tonight. I have no way to speak to them again once they leave the concert. I have no way to know who bought the album," he said. "With Community, once they text the number, we now have a way to stay in touch directly. And that information is not owned by anyone but the artist, the talent or the person who's building a business."
Companies advertise a phone number that users text to sign up for updates. McDonald's posted its number on a billboard in Times Square just this month. The service also allows brands to segment customers who sign up for texts, so if an artist has an concert coming up in Atlanta, only people in Atlanta get the texts.
Using text messages to connect with customers, for all its promise, poses unique challenges. Brands are required to get their customers to opt in to messages, which is hard to do unless the brand is already well established. And customers may want to hear from fewer brands in their text inbox than they do in their email inbox.
"As opposed to email, when you have to scroll to the bottom of the thing and hit the link that says unsubscribe, if you don't like the text messages you're getting, you only have to write one word: Stop," Mr. Kutcher said. (That's some news you can use.)
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Rupert Murdoch makes another deal. Fox News settled a defamation case with Dominion Voting Systems at the last minute for $ 788 billion. The deal allowed Murdoch and his company's executives to avoid having to testify, but it also handed Staple Street, the private equity owner of Dominion, a big payday after it bought the company for $ 38 million in 2018. His son Lachlan, C.E.O. of Fox Corporation, also settled a separate defamation suit against an Australian publisher this week.
Return to sender. Netflix ended its DVD delivery service after 25 years. The streaming company's original business model revolved around sending discs by mail, and at its peak, in 2010, about 20 million subscribers used the service. The company announced the changes as it reported first-quarter profits of $ 1.3 billion, up 4 percent year on year.
Gary Gensler gets a grilling. The chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was hammered by Republicans over the agency's handling of the cryptocurrency industry, in an appearance before the House Financial Services Committee. Gensler defended the regulator, saying he had never seen a sector break so many securities laws with such regularity, after being accused of failing to spot problems at FTX before the cryptocurrency exchange collapsed.
China's economy bounces back, kind of. In its first full quarter since Beijing lifted punishing Covid restrictions, the world's second-largest economy beat expectations on the back of surging consumer spending, rising exports and government-led infrastructure spending. But youth unemployment hit 19.6 percent, its second-highest mark on record, suggesting that businesses are not convinced that Beijing is finished dabbling in the private sector and that economic uncertainty is over.
Goldman Sachs quickens its retail banking U-turn. The Wall Street giant reported lackluster first-quarter returns and accelerated its retreat from consumer banking, including putting its GreenSky unit up for sale just a year after buying the lending company for $ 2.2 billion. One spot of new business: The bank introduced a savings account with Apple that offers a 4.15 percent annual interest rate -- more than 10 times the national average.
BMW gets into hot water over ice cream. The German carmaker was forced to apologize after being accused of discriminating against Chinese visitors to the Shanghai auto show this week. Images went viral on Chinese social media of workers at its booth appearing to give free ice cream to a western man after telling ethnic Chinese attendees that they had run out.
Term of the week: 'Greenhushing'
Ever since Earth Day was established in 1970, companies have advertised their green initiatives on April 22. But with many Republicans now taking a strong stand against corporate environmentalism and targeting companies that publicize their climate change-related goals, you might see fewer companies touting their green credentials this year. Instead, some businesses are resorting to "greenhushing." An analysis of 1,200 companies published last fall by South Pole, a Swiss consultancy, found that one in four planned to go green but then "go dark" -- that is, keep its green goals under the radar.
A.I., the artist
Artificial intelligence has had a creative few weeks: A song that used A.I. to mimic the voices of Drake and The Weeknd went viral; a murder-mystery novel penned using A.I. is available to preorder; and an image generated by A.I. won one of the world's biggest photography prizes. DealBook wrote last week that A.I. was creating thorny copyright issues, but it is also raising questions about the nature of human creativity itself.
Companies have tried to draw lines between human and machine-generated work. Streaming services, including Spotify and Apple Music, pulled the tech-created song from their platforms this week. And Universal Music Group urged the services to block A.I. from scraping its songs for use as training data.
Some artists see creative possibilities rather than threats. Stephen Marche, who wrote the cheekily titled "Death of an Author" novel using three A.I. programs, compared the process to composing hip-hop: "You don't necessarily know how to drum, but you definitely need to know how beats work, how hooks work, and you need to be able to put them together in a meaningful way," he told The New York Times. "I am the creator of this work, 100 percent," Marche said, "but, on the other hand, I didn't create the words."
Who is the creator? Boris Eldagsen, the Berlin artist whose A.I.-generated "Pseudomnesia: The Electrician" won the creative open category at the Sony World Photography Awards, told DealBook that making the image had been like directing a film.
"On a movie there is a set director, there is a cameraman, and there is an actress and a story writer, and I tell them which direction to go," he said. "I am the one, as an artist, who needs to connect all of this to the world, the human condition."
He entered the competition to kick-start a conversation about separating the art of photography from A.I.-generated art, which he considers co-creation.
But who should take credit for this type of collaboration? Generative A.I. is informed by reference material created by human artists. It becomes more complicated when A.I. is used to imitate a particular performer, or a specific artist's drawing style. Last month, the Recording Industry Association of America launched a "human artistry campaign," which argues that the makers of A.I. need to license copyrighted work they use as training data. And Holly Herndon, a musician, started a company to build consent guidelines for the tech. "The creative possibilities there are fascinating and will change art forever," she told The Times. "We just have to figure out the terms and tech."

Full text: Documenting the damage of last month's earthquakes in Turkey.
Times graphics reporters Anjali Singhvi and Bedel Saget recently traveled to Antakya, a Turkish city badly damaged by February's earthquakes. Based on their reporting, they published an article this week that walks through the damage in Antakya's Old City, a commercial and religious hub.
The initial quakes were several weeks ago, but the damage continues to dominate life in much of Turkey and Syria. I spoke with Anjali and Bedel about what they saw in Antakya.
Ashley: What surprised you about Antakya's destruction?
Bedel: I had in my mind what the destruction would look like, but when you're driving around and seeing residential building after residential building flattened, it stops you in your tracks. We saw a building split in half -- half had collapsed and half was still standing -- and we could see an entire dining room set still present on the third floor, as though it were a dollhouse.
Anjali: We also saw so many photographs of missing people placed right outside the damaged buildings. I had assumed they were part of residents' belongings in that building, but a local journalist told me that families left photos of their loved ones around the site of the rubble so that if someone clears debris or continues the search, those photos might help identify bodies.
Times graphics reporters often use satellite imagery to reconstruct disaster sites. Why was actually being in Antakya important for this project?
Anjali: Before the trip, I had identified some areas from drone imagery of Antakya that seemed most damaged, and speculated that those areas could be good to cover. But when I was reporting on the ground, all the locals talked about an area I hadn't considered: Old City, a historic part of Antakya.
Old City was home to so many different kinds of buildings -- churches, mosques, a synagogue, restored boutique hotels, jewelry shops, silk stores, a local favorite hummus shop, just real gems. Amid the rubble, we saw government officials putting up signs on various buildings in Old City, labeling them as important cultural assets and warning people not to tamper anymore with the debris. From being there, I saw how Antakya had history in its soil, its buildings and its people. And it was Old City that really brought the community together.
Did you get the sense that residents wanted to stay as Antakya rebuilds?
Bedel: Quite a number of people left if they had the means to: Either they had family in other parts of Turkey or if they had homes elsewhere. But among those who stayed, everyone we spoke to talked about the commitment to rebuild, no matter what.
The things that made Old City a gathering spot -- the atmosphere, the aura, the embrace of different cultures -- I could feel that's what they longed for most. I spoke to a young woman, who recently graduated from medical school, who said, "It was good before, but we didn't understand before we lost our city, how important it was to us."
See what was lost in Antakya's Old City, through one street at the heart of the community.
Anjali is a reporter and a former architect whose work at The Times includes reconstructing building disasters, such as a Bronx apartment fire and Miami's Surfside condo collapse. Bedel joined The Times in 1991, and has covered hurricanes, wildfires and nine Olympic Games.

U.S. Brands Gain Edge With Tax Breaks for E.V.s: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Ewing, Jack

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Rules that take effect on Tuesday will limit the $ 7,500 credits to electric cars made domestically with minerals from the U.S. or trade allies.
American brands like Tesla and General Motors will benefit most from rules that determine which electric vehicles qualify for tax credits starting on Tuesday. Foreign carmakers like Hyundai will be at a significant disadvantage because of restrictions aimed at cutting China out of the supply chain.
Only 10 vehicles will initially qualify for tax credits of $ 7,500, less than a quarter of the battery-powered cars on sale in the United States. But those 10 include many of the most popular models and accounted for two-thirds of electric vehicle sales before the new rules took effect.
Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y, the best-selling electric vehicles in the United States, will qualify for the full $ 7,500 credit, with one exception, according to a list published by the Treasury Department on Monday. The least expensive version of the Model 3 will qualify for only half the credit because its battery is made in China.
G.M.'s Chevrolet Bolt, one of the cheapest electric vehicles on the market, will also qualify, as will sport utility vehicles and pickups that the company plans to begin selling this year.
Fewer Ford vehicles will qualify for the full $ 7,500 credit because of rules requiring that a certain percentage of the battery components and minerals like lithium come from either domestic sources or trade allies. Ford's Mustang Mach-E, the third-best-selling electric vehicle in the United States last year, according to Kelley Blue Book, will be eligible for only half the credit because its Polish-made battery does not meet domestic sourcing requirements. The F-150 Lightning pickup will continue to qualify for the full credit.
Chrysler and Jeep, divisions of Stellantis, do not yet sell cars that run solely on batteries, but several of their hybrid models will qualify for at least some of the credit. Hybrid vehicles can qualify if their batteries have a capacity of at least seven kilowatt-hours.
The rules give U.S. carmakers at least a temporary advantage over competitors like Toyota, Volkswagen and Nissan. No foreign automakers were on the Treasury list, which is expected to grow as companies adjust their supply chains.
Carmakers that qualify for the tax credits will now have a head start as sales of electric vehicles take off. "It causes a multiplier effect in the market," Paul Jacobson, G.M.'s chief financial officer, told reporters in New York this month. The rules, he added, are "very consistent with the strategy that we had already adopted."
The rules grow out of the Inflation Reduction Act, which Democrats passed last year to fight climate change and encourage domestic manufacturing among other things. The Treasury Department was responsible for writing regulations based on the legislation.
The law seeks to reduce the auto industry's reliance on China, which makes most of the world's batteries and dominates the processing of raw materials. The law also establishes limits on sales prices and excludes individuals who earn more than $ 150,000 a year and couples who make more than $ 300,000. The rules also exclude vehicles made outside North America, including in allied countries like South Korea and Germany.
"We were not happy," José Muñoz, the chief executive of Hyundai and Genesis Motor North America, said in an interview at the New York International Auto Show this month. Hyundai's Ioniq 6 electric sedan was named World Car of the Year at the show, but will not be eligible for tax credits because it is assembled in South Korea.
Hyundai, based in Seoul, is investing $ 10 billion to build car and battery plants in Georgia, which will allow the company to meet the Inflation Reduction Act requirements -- but not for several years.
Officials at the carmaker and the South Korean government asked the Biden administration to allow Hyundai and Kia cars to qualify for credits while the factories were under construction, but were told that the law did not allow such an exception, Mr. Muñoz said.
The Hyundai car factory in Georgia is expected to begin producing cars in 2025. The battery plant, which Hyundai is building with SK On, will start production in 2026. "We are working on putting ahead that date so we can qualify earlier," Mr. Muñoz said.
Tesla had already told potential buyers that the least expensive version of the Model 3 sedan would qualify for only half the credit, or $ 3,750. This month, Tesla cut the price of that car by $ 1,000 to $ 41,990. After the partial credit is accounted for, the car will effectively cost many buyers a little more than $ 38,000, about as much as a top-of-the-line Honda Accord and cheaper than an entry-level BMW 3 Series sedan.
Other versions of the Model 3 and Model Y S.U.V. will continue to receive the full credit. Tesla sold more electric vehicles in the United States last year than all other carmakers combined, according to Kelley Blue Book.
Some auto executives have said the rules are too restrictive and undermine efforts to limit climate change. Other critics, like Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, have complained that the Biden administration's rules are too lenient.
Administration officials have argued that the regulations strike a balance between promoting electric vehicles and building a domestic supply chain.
By the administration's count, besides the 10 vehicles that qualify for the full credit, seven qualify for half the credit. Vehicles can qualify for half the credit if, for example, their battery components come from the United States, Canada or Mexico but the minerals used to make the batteries do not meet the sourcing requirements.
Ten vehicles that previously qualified, including the Nissan Leaf and the Volkswagen ID.4, will drop off the list, at least temporarily.
The ID.4, an S.U.V. made in Chattanooga, Tenn., did not make the new list because it is still assessing its supply chain. But Pablo Di Si, the chief executive of Volkswagen Group of America, said he expected the model to qualify. Volkswagen was fourth behind Tesla, G.M. and Ford in U.S. electric vehicle sales in the first three months of the year, according to Kelley Blue Book.
Five electric vehicles that G.M. sells or is planning to sell this year will qualify. In addition to the Bolt, the Cadillac Lyriq and electric versions of the Chevrolet Equinox and Blazer S.U.V.s and the Silverado pickup will qualify for the full credit. G.M. and LG Energy Solution have begun producing battery cells at a factory in Ohio.
The new rules could be revised in response to comments from the public. It is up to carmakers to show that they qualify, but they are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service and could be penalized if they provide incorrect information. The I.R.S. publishes a list of eligible vehicles that is updated regularly.
A provision in the law for commercial vehicles allows companies to collect the credits for all leased vehicles even if the cars don't meet sourcing and manufacturing requirements. Automakers and their dealers can pass on the savings to people who lease cars, and, as a result, Hyundai has seen a spike in leases, Mr. Muñoz said. The company is also offering cars through monthly subscriptions to let customers benefit from tax incentives and try electric cars.
But that will not make up for lost sales, because most people prefer buying rather than leasing or renting cars, Mr. Muñoz said.
"We cannot compete unless we simply drop dramatically the price," he said. "It's impossible to make it work from a financial point of view."

Companies In Germany Strengthen Ties to China: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Some are expanding in China, reluctant to leave a huge market they need to finance operations back home.
As Washington seeks to throttle economic ties with Beijing, two powerful engines of the German economy, Volkswagen and the chemical company BASF, are broadening their huge Chinese investments.
Volkswagen, which has more than 40 plants in China, announced a new effort to tailor models to Chinese customers' wishes, with features like in-dash karaoke machines, and will invest billions in local partnerships and production sites. It's part of a theme unveiled by the German automaker last year: "In China for China."
BASF, with 30 production facilities in China, is pushing ahead with plans to spend 10 billion euros ( $ 10.9 billion) on a new chemical production complex that would rival in size its massive headquarters complex in Ludwigshafen, which covers about four square miles.
Throughout Germany, executives are aware such investments run contrary to efforts by the United States to isolate China economically. They counter that revenue from China is essential for their businesses to thrive and grow in Europe.
Martin Brudermüller, BASF's chief executive, said earnings from China allowed the company to effectively offset losses from Europe's high energy costs and stringent environmental rules.
"Without the business in China, the necessary restructuring here would not be so possible," Mr. Brudermüller told reporters at his company's annual earnings conference in February. "Name me just one investment in Europe where we could make money."
Executives at Volkswagen privately concede the automaker is in a similar quandary. High energy and labor costs have left the company heavily reliant on sales from China to help underwrite operations in Europe.
Now ever-closer business ties are coming under scrutiny in Berlin. For months, at the urging of Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a policy proposal has been making the rounds of German ministries aiming to reset the country's relationship with China, its largest trade partner. The aim is to strike a balance between diversifying Germany's ties throughout Asia to avoid dependence on Chinese imports, while acknowledging the importance of doing business with China.
The Biden administration has pledged to make the United States more competitive with China by expanding American infrastructure and manufacturing, rather than negotiating new trade deals. German lawmakers and business leaders have made clear that their relationship with China is more nuanced: open to vigorous trade while trying to diversify into other Asian markets.
It is a policy being developed after a bruising year when Russia shut down natural gas shipments to Germany, a move that reminded lawmakers of the costs of relying on autocratic nations for materials essential to its industrial backbone. In the case of China, a big problem is Germany's dependence on its imports.
Germany depends on China to provide essential technology products, including mobile phones and LEDs, as well as raw materials, including lithium and rare earth elements. These are critical to Germany's plans to make a transition to cleaner energy and transportation.
Such a reliance must be carefully considered as Germany thinks strategically about its future dealings with China, said Katrin Kamin, a director of the Kiel Initiative in Geopolitics and Economics. Reducing its ties anytime soon is not a reasonable option.
"Germany will not be able to simply relax its relations with China in the short term," Ms. Kamin said. "The dependencies are too great for that."
The European Union has had a bumpier relationship with China. A breakthrough trade and investment deal between the bloc and China, a product of years of talks that was approved in 2020, was shelved less than a year later, after Beijing imposed sanctions on E.U. lawmakers for criticizing China's treatment of its Uyghur population. The deal would have made it easier for companies to operate on one another's territory.
Last week, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, traveled to Beijing with President Emmanuel Macron of France as part of an effort to "rebalance" economic ties with China. She called for the revival of talks about trade, but pointed out stumbling blocks like the support China offers its domestic manufacturers and the restrictions it places on foreign companies.
"China is a crucial trade partner, but E.U. businesses face many discriminatory hurdles," Ms. von der Leyen said after meetings with organizations in Beijing. "European companies have so much to offer China. But they need a level playing field to invest and provide their goods and services."
She told reporters that the stalled trade deal was not discussed in talks with China's leader, Xi Jinping, during the trip.
With foreign trade sales of €297.9 billion last year, China has been Germany's biggest trading partner for seven years in a row. But Germany's trade deficit with China has grown increasingly lopsided, a trend that worsened during the supply chain disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Last year, imports from China expanded by a third, to €191 billion, while exports grew only 3 percent, to €107 billion.
One area where Germany has long dominated ties with China is the automobile industry. German automakers, including BMW and Mercedes-Benz, sell roughly a third of all vehicles they produce in China -- exceeding sales in all of Western Europe. But recent data shows that Germans appear to be losing their grip on the Chinese market, especially as the popularity of domestically produced electric vehicles surges.
Auto insurance registration records show that only 2.4 percent of all electric vehicles sold in China last year were made by Volkswagen, while BMW and Mercedes failed to crack even 1 percent, according to the German business daily Handelsblatt. By comparison, German brands continue to dominate the Chinese market for combustion engine vehicles, but their popularity is giving way to E.V.s.
Perhaps ominously, Chinese electric brands, such as BYD and Nio, are entering the German market, posing a threat to German automakers on their home territory.
In a clear sign of his priorities, within months of taking over as the chief executive of Volkswagen in September, Oliver Blume spent weeks touring China and returned vowing to strengthen his company's partnerships there.
"We have to cooperate much more closely with our local partners in order to listen to the customers in the Chinese region," Mr. Blume told reporters at the company's annual earning meeting last month. "This will be part of a strategy for 2030."
A study by the Kiel Institute showed that decoupling from China would be very costly for all of Europe, but especially Germany, given the strength of its economic ties. Calculations by the institute, based on gross domestic product from 2019, showed that Germany could lose income worth more than €131 billion. And it could be even more if China retaliated.
Berlin would like to avoid another round of the upheaval it experienced after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, leading to an energy war that cost Germany its affordable supply of natural gas. That will mean continuing to balance economic interests with security concerns, Jörg Kukies, an economic adviser to Mr. Scholz, told a gathering of German and American trade leaders.
"We want to have a positive approach to China," Mr. Kukies said. "Not an anti-China approach."

Is That a TV on the Dashboard?: [Style Desk]

Full text: As luxury cars become rolling supercomputers, designers are wondering how big is too big.
From pocket-stretching smartphones to wall-hogging TVs, Americans have often asked: How much screen is too much?
The question has come to today's gadget-stuffed cars, whose increasingly colossal screens are splitting opinions among designers, car buyers and industry critics. These do-it-all touch screens, the nerve centers of many new cars, have sparked a backlash because of their size, as well as the clunky interfaces that may take eyes off the road.
"I think we've reached Peak Screen," said Klaus Busse, Maserati's head of design, who previously led design for Alfa Romeo, Fiat and Lancia. "Screens have their right of existence -- they do a lot of things better than physical switches. It's just been pushed a little too far."
Beyond having ergonomic and safety concerns, some luxury designers object on aesthetic grounds. To them, screens just aren't sexy or luxurious.
"When flat screens showed up, the-bigger-the-better was the trend," said Kai Langer, head of design for BMW i, the automaker's electric division. "But 'bigger' isn't always the richest."
Screens are now integral to most modern cars, which are more or less rolling supercomputers, running up to 14 times more code than a Boeing 787. And designers must keep in mind the demands of car owners who expect that their Apple or Android smartphones will hook up flawlessly.
"Steve Jobs changed the world, and now mankind touches a screen," said Gorden Wagener, the chief designer for Mercedes-Benz. "That fundamentally changes the car as well. The car needs a good interface, not just a wiper switch and turn indicator."
When Elon Musk unveiled the Tesla Model S in 2009, the command center, with its 17-inch LCD touch screen, seemed nearly as game-changing as the car itself. And in giving drivers digital control of automotive functions, Tesla was able to avoid the expense of engineering, wiring and building a cabin full of pricey analog switches, knobs and gauges -- or having to buy them from another automaker or supplier.
In Tesla's bare-bones Model 3 and Model Y especially, one might suspect that interior designers worked overtime on their ingenious screens and then called it a day. A number of Tesla's competitors mimicked the cabins' austere, vaguely sci-fi vibe.
The creators of later electric vehicles -- including BMW's futuristic yet sumptuous iX and the Kia EV6 -- came up with warmer car interiors better suited to drivers who may not want to feel as if they are spending hours inside the mainframe from "Tron." Some designers are even ditching that most played-out of E.V. tropes, the Mac-like monochromes of gray-silver-white.
With its expanded touch screen, Tesla also spurred an arms race measured in inches. Ford stuffed a 15.5-inch screen into its Mustang Mach-e and F-150 Lightning E.V.s. The start-up Rivian has installed a 16-inch display in the R1T and R1S models. Another California company, Lucid, created a 34-inch, curved-glass screen for the Air sedan.
And then there is the "Hyperscreen," from Mercedes-Benz.
Powered by eight processors, framed under a sculptural slab of double-coated glass, the Hyperscreen (actually three screens that appear as one) spreads 56 inches of digital interface across the dashboard. Augmented-reality navigation generates virtual street signs and directional guides over the pavement in a real-time camera view. Almost magically, virtual address numbers hover over homes and businesses as you approach a destination.
Yet the Hyperscreen doesn't always work as elegantly as it looks -- especially when drivers are, well, driving. Issues include fussy thumb-pad controls on the steering wheel and moments of hair-pulling confusion, especially for customers who grew up with predigital rides. Mr. Wagener said that Mercedes intentionally launched its Hyperscreen in its electric vehicles to aim it at tech-savvy customers.
BMW is no stranger to screens, having ushered in iDrive more than 20 years ago on the 7-Series sedan. That digital operating system, with a now-quaint 6.5-inch screen atop the dashboard, infuriated many drivers because it was so hard to use. But as BMW refined it over the years, rival car companies adopted similar systems.
The i7 sedan, a new electric model from BMW, wraps a curved screen around the driver. The back of the car offers a 31-inch, fold-down theater touch screen, with 5G connectivity and Amazon Fire for streaming. Another 5.5-inch screen nestles into each rear armrest.
At the annual CES in Las Vegas in January, BMW threw down that gauntlet by going well beyond the touch screen. In the iVision Dee, a concept sedan that previews a range of BMW "Neue Klasse" E.V.s -- the first scheduled to arrive in 2025 -- the windshield itself takes the place of a dashboard touch screen.
"Let's use the biggest display we already have in a car, which is the windshield," Mr. Langer, the BMW design chief, said.
The augmented-reality windshield allows for "Minority Report"-style projections of traditional gauges (speedometer; temperature settings; audio displays) and social-and-streaming content. The system, which BMW will call Panoramic Vision on showroom models, greatly expands the head-up displays that project content into the field of view, allowing drivers to check the controls without looking away from the road.
For those leery of astral projections blocking their view of I-95, Mr. Langer said that drivers could choose any display level. A "mixed reality slider" can limit traditional information, such as a speedometer, to a thin strip of lower windshield, where today's head-up displays already operate. Drivers more at ease with digital projections can fill more of the windshield glass with content. When the car isn't moving, including during charging stops, passengers may eventually use the entire windshield like a virtual drive-in for movies, games, Zoom meetings or trips to the metaverse.
At the convention in Las Vegas, the BMW chairman Oliver Zipse said he was convinced that regulators would eventually ban large dashboard screens because of safety concerns. "If you have to look down to operate your car, we think it's a big mistake," he told Automotive News Europe.
Mr. Langer noted that prominent screens do not appear in the pages of high-end shelter or architectural magazines. "None of our consumers would want to cover their living room in screens," he said. "They want their Eames chair or Nelson clock. And we want our customers to feel at home."
And if touch screens shrink or even disappear from cars' cabins, designers will be free to reclaim the interiors for something more aesthetically pleasing. "A touch screen doesn't speak to our senses," Mr. Langer said. "We're made to touch fabrics and sense different surfaces; that's what makes us human."
Some of the iVision Dee's fanciful tech -- including a chameleon-like body that can instantly change to one of 32 colors -- may be ditched or watered down in production versions. Yet BMW vows the panoramic display is bound for showrooms.
Mercedes-Benz is skeptical. While it offers head-up displays, it is convinced that windshield projections "are light-years behind the quality and resolution you can achieve on a screen," Mr. Wagener said.
"It's certainly an innovative approach," he continued. "But we've tried it, and it's disturbing or disorienting to have all that in your viewing area."
Maserati is steering a middle course with its GranTurismo. Its interior includes a pair of screens that don't draw attention to themselves.
"We don't want a screen to be the main protagonist," Mr. Busse, the Maserati design chief, said.
In his view, the car is a refuge from the digital world and its pressures.
"For us," he said, "it's still about the driving experience -- to enjoy this beautiful machine and the countryside where you're operating it."

Full text: The planned summer wedding of the 92-year-old media mogul and Ann Lesley Smith is said to have been called off. It would have been his fifth marriage.
Last month Rupert Murdoch presented an engagement ring to Ann Lesley Smith, a 66-year-old former dental hygienist whom he had met last year at his vineyard in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles. A little over two weeks later, the wedding has been canceled.
A spokesman for Mr. Murdoch declined to comment Tuesday. A person close to him, speaking on the condition of anonymity to share details concerning a personal matter, acknowledged that the planned summer wedding had been called off, adding that it would not be a "great leap" to say that Mr. Murdoch's relationship with Ms. Smith had come to an end. The wedding would have been the media magnate's fifth trip down the aisle and Ms. Smith's fourth.
Mr. Murdoch, 92, made the engagement public last month through Cindy Adams, the veteran gossip columnist at one of the many newspapers he owns, The New York Post. After reporting that Mr. Murdoch had presented Ms. Smith with a diamond engagement ring in New York on St. Patrick's Day, the columnist included a comment from her boss: "I dreaded falling in love -- but I knew this would be my last," he said. "It better be. I'm happy."
In the days after the engagement, details began to emerge about Ms. Smith, who was born Ann Krohn and attended high school in Petaluma, Calif. Efforts to reach Ms. Smith by phone and via social media were unsuccessful, and she did not immediately reply to a message passed to her by a worker on her property in Escalon, Calif.
In her 20s, while working as a dental hygienist in the Bay Area, Ms. Smith met John B. Huntington, a California railroad heir nearly 20 years her senior. During their marriage, which lasted from 1985 to 1989, she spent lavishly on clothes, rode horses and did charity work, she said in a 2013 interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network. "Money was no object," she said. "I had everything in the world."
In 1988, she was involved in an imbroglio at a society gala on the dance floor of the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco. Reuters described the melee as "a shoving match between two San Francisco socialites," Ann K. Huntington (as Ms. Smith was then known) and another guest, Avelina Pritchard. "She pulled my hair," Ms. Pritchard said in an interview for this article. "She scratched me." Ms. Smith pleaded no contest to misdemeanor assault and was ordered to donate $ 3,000 to a shelter for abused women, Reuters reported at the time.
In the interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Ms. Smith claimed that, after her marriage to Mr. Huntington, she had no place to live and had become suicidal because of a stingy prenuptial agreement.
While pressing for greater financial support in court, she alleged that her former husband had been physically abusive. Court documents from the case show that three mental health experts testified on Ms. Smith's behalf, saying that the marriage had left her with post-traumatic stress disorder, rendering her unable to work. But a psychiatrist who treated Ms. Smith in the late 1980s disputed that assessment in his testimony, according to the court documents.
Ms. Smith's life began to turn around when she became a Christian, she told the network, adding that she had started doing volunteer work as a chaplain for police departments in Marin County. In 1999, she wed Michael Carabello, a former percussionist in the rock band Santana. The fact of that marriage, which lasted about a year, did not appear in the spate of reports published in the wake of her engagement to Mr. Murdoch.
Her third marriage was to Chester Smith, a radio and television entrepreneur in Modesto, Calif., who had started out as a disc jockey and country singer. Ms. Smith appeared at his side on the cover of "Captured by Love," a 2005 album credited to "Chester Smith with Ann Lesley Smith." In the photo, Mr. Smith is holding a guitar and has one foot on the fender of a Rolls-Royce. Ms. Smith is dressed in a police uniform with a priest's collar, her hand on her husband's shoulder.
At the time of their meeting, Mr. Smith had been married to his first wife, Naomi Smith, for more than four decades. Together they had built his radio and television business into a mini-empire that included stations in California and Oregon. One of their three daughters, Lorna Scott-Smith, said she had not been invited to her father's wedding to his second wife. "I never met her," Ms. Scott-Smith said in an interview.
After Mr. Smith died at age 78 in 2008, another of Mr. Smith's daughters, Roxanne Storey, sued Ann Lesley Smith in San Joaquin County Superior Court. She alleged that Ms. Smith, the trustee of his estate, had failed to give her and her sisters their fair share of the inheritance.
The case was settled out of court after Judge Duane Martin admonished Ms. Smith in a ruling, writing that "the court has lost all confidence in her ability to administer the trust other than for her own benefit, in conflict with her fiduciary duty to Chester Smith's three daughters."
Mr. Murdoch's broken engagement comes at a time when he is embroiled in a $ 1.6 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems against two of his companies, Fox Corporation and Fox News. Last week, a judge in Delaware Superior Court ruled that the case was strong enough to go to trial.
Mr. Murdoch's fourth marriage, to the actress and model Jerry Hall, ended in divorce last summer after six years.

Lights, Camera, Easel: The Artist as Contestant: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: "The Exhibit," a reality TV picture of the art world, varnishes the sheer desperation found at almost every level, and the complexity of art itself.
There's a certain impurity to being an artist in the 21st century. Your collectors could be paying with dirty money. Your exhibitions often wear corporate logos. And your public image might even require the strategic indignity of going on TV.
For reality television, "The Exhibit" is awfully realistic.
The six-part series, a joint venture of MTV and the Smithsonian Channel, has its finale this Friday. Seven rising artists have competed for a grand prize of $ 100,000 and a solo exhibition (which everyone seems obliged to call an exhibit) at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C. They've been judged by established art-world figures including Adam Pendleton, a multidisciplinary artist who combines linguistics, painting and political action; Abigail DeVille, who creates sculptural environments from urban debris; and Kenny Schachter, introduced on the show with unintended humor as an "artist, writer, teacher and pioneer in the NFT space."
Egos flare and tears flow, a little -- this is no battle royale. In fact, there are no weekly eliminations: Everyone, according to the poised lead judge and Hirshhorn director, Melissa Chiu, deserves to be there. And everyone comes off looking like a decent human being. The drama typical of the genre has been sanded down. Artists and curators will recognize, and the casual viewer might be intrigued by, this chic little slice of the culture industry. Those seeking a quick hit of schadenfreude will be disappointed. Which is probably why "The Exhibit" has averaged roughly a tenth the viewership of the first season of Bravo's "Work of Art," its more sensational predecessor from a decade ago.
Where "The Exhibit" differs most from "Work of Art" is in the professionalism of the contestants. The hopefuls range from Jennifer Warren, a largely self-taught painter from Chicago who, according to her website, "explores themes around nature, beauty, and the Black body"; to Clare Kambhu, a high school art teacher from Queens with an MFA from Yale who depicts the structures of the education system. The intellectual and technical skill they bring to bear on their weekly "commissions" makes for visually pleasing and conceptually solid paintings, sculptures and prints. They're good at describing their intentions and taking criticism.
The upshot of their experience is their reluctance to step outside their honed styles. The artists know the prompts in advance, and come prepared with materials, tools and plans, which they execute for the cameras in a studio decoratively stocked with paints and brushes. Misha Kahn, for instance, a graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design's furniture program, is a brutally effective fabricator, employing everything from inflatable pool toys to electric motors to a virtual reality headset to make his sculptures. In the intro episode, the artists give tours of their home studios. Kahn's "robust" workshop in Brooklyn has several assistants, a row of 3-D printers, and a robot arm that paints.
The size of their ateliers varies, but these artists are successful enough to understand what's at stake at the Hirshhorn, and what's not. Jamaal Barber, a printmaker from Georgia, contributed an illustration to The New York Times Magazine's 1619 Project. Frank Buffalo Hyde, a painter and member of the Onondaga/Niimíipuu (Nez Percé) people, has 13 pieces in the collection of the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian.
Bravo's series dangled the prize of a solo show at the Brooklyn Museum (in reality, a single gallery that the critic Karen Rosenberg called a "glorified broom closet" in these pages). One contestant on "The Exhibit," Baseera Khan, had a solo show at that selfsame institution during filming. Not that these artists aren't struggling; you just wouldn't know it. That's the elephant in the Sculpture Garden. MTV's picture of the art world varnishes the sheer desperation and insecurity found at almost every level of the game.
Who won either of the two seasons of "Work of Art"? I can't remember either. Not even the Turner Prize guarantees a life of name recognition, let alone awards and solo shows sponsored by the likes of BMW, Red Bull and Hugo Boss. The prize money is real enough. But the idea that winning a contest guarantees a long career is unrealistic, maybe even irresponsible. There's no arriving, only striving. Indeed, Khan's Brooklyn Museum show was also a prize, sponsored by the UOVO art storage company. Pay close attention to "The Exhibit," or scan the contestants' CVs, and you can discern the contours of a midcareer life in the arts: a craggy, variegated landscape of grants, commissions and awards that sustain artists through the feast and famine of the "meritocratic" art world.
Add MTV and the Smithsonian Channel (and their parent entity, Paramount Global) to the list of brands funding artists. In a way, their partnership is complimentary -- art can be sexy and rebellious (MTV) as well as highbrow and profound (Smithsonian). Nadim Amiry, vice president of original series at MTV Entertainment Studios, described in an email the challenges of bringing art to reality TV: "Like with any skill-based competition series," he wrote, "whether it be designing dresses or baking cakes or creating works of art, the challenge for producers remains the same. It's in providing the audience with enough information and knowledge to be able to play along and feel that they too can evaluate the work on the show."
Kate Gibbs, a representative for the Hirshhorn, added that "the Hirshhorn is open to all, 364 days a year. Our lobby, galleries and programs reflect a broad appeal."
Yet the packaging of "The Exhibit" seems too tight for the artists to flourish; the mass audience and the ticking clock work against complexity.
In an episode of "Work of Art," Andres Serrano was a guest judge -- and his passionate, provocative "Piss Christ," denounced by conservative senators in the culture wars of the '90s, had an extended cameo. That week's theme was "shock."
"The Exhibit" is a show for a more sensitive time. The prompts don't titillate; they delight, educate and heal. The seven contestants address Covid, social media, gender and justice -- as Chiu says, "the most pressing issues of today" -- and they do so with care. For the most part they turn in safe, competent work about incredibly volatile subjects. Barber, one of the more emotionally naked artists, faced the topic of justice with a wooden relief covered in flaring red circles representing the 41 bullets police fired at Amadou Diallo in 1999 (19 struck him) -- a piece so abstract and colorful that the tragedy disappeared.
Barber's commission is just one of many missed chances to slow down and discuss what, if anything, makes art worthwhile. Instead, the judges' critiques and deliberations feel padded with clichés about creativity, storytelling and changing minds. An MTV News correspondent, Dometi Pongo, confesses in Episode 4 that, "as the layperson" among art world acolytes, he finds contestant Jillian Mayer's grungy, gravel-strewn kinetic sculpture "grotesque." Why not mention the fraught and fascinating role of beauty in art? Not that I expect a history lesson. But the debate that follows feels watered down. Chiu patiently explains that beauty isn't "really one of the criteria that we use to understand or even appreciate the work of contemporary art." Schachter jumps in: "But looking good is something still." "Looking good is something," Chiu concedes, "but it's not about the beautiful." "But it's not not about that," says Schachter. Then they change the subject.
"The Exhibit" wants to convey art's power and mystique without estranging the uninitiated. The show seems anxious that no one will care about art without the artificial drama of a competition, but that downplays whatever drama actually exists in art. Yet the contest's conceit feels halfhearted. The show's impulse to comfort is so urgent that I suspected the series might end with everyone winning, the way the 2019 Turner Prize went to all four finalists. The truth is, all seven of these artists do win "The Exhibit" -- final outcome aside -- just by sticking around, and rejecting the synthetic blood lust of most reality TV.
You may ask why respectable professionals would go on such a show in the first place, or why a respected museum would host one. This, maybe despite itself, is the unflinching realism of "The Exhibit." When the art world is set up as a gantlet of competitions, no artist or institution can afford not to chase the next once-in-a-lifetime chance.

In 'Beef,' Road Rage and More: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- In the upcoming Netflix series "Beef," Steven Yeun plays Danny Cho, a struggling handyman in Los Angeles who becomes embroiled in a road rage incident with Amy Lau, a wealthy entrepreneur played by Ali Wong. Over 10 episodes, their simmering hatred fuels an escalating series of poor decisions, setting off a bizarre chain of retribution including but not limited to robbery, vandalism, catfishing and bad Yelp reviews.
The show was created by the writer Lee Sung Jin ("Dave," "Two Broke Girls"), who first worked with Yeun and Wong on the animated series "Tuca & Bertie." (Yeun and Wong played a robin and a song thrush who are lovers.) Around the same time, Lee was involved in a road rage confrontation in Los Angeles that would inspire his new series.
"Beef" is Lee's first outing as a series creator and showrunner. It also features Yeun's first regular role on live-action TV since his character, Glenn, was killed off "The Walking Dead" in 2016. Glenn's gruesome murder sparked viewer outrage but things worked out great for Yeun, who has since appeared in acclaimed films like "Minari," which brought him an Academy Award nomination for best actor, and "Burning."
Lee and Yeun are set to work together again on Marvel's forthcoming "Thunderbolts" movie, their first forays into the MCU: Lee as a writer, Yeun in a yet-to-be-revealed role.
On an afternoon in March, Yeun and Lee got together at the Apple Pan, a beloved hole-in-the-wall burger joint on L.A.'s west side. Over hickory burgers, fries and slices of pie, they talked about how they met, the inspiration for "Beef" and their Korean church connections. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Tell me about the "incident."
LEE SUNG JIN I was getting on the 10. The light turned green and I didn't go right away, and a white BMW X3 starts honking like crazy, pulls up next to me and [the driver] says a bunch of [expletive] at me. I was like, That's not OK -- I'm going to follow him home. In reality, I wasn't actually going to follow him; I'm not that courageous. But back then I lived in Santa Monica -- when we both got off at Fourth Street, I'm just commuting home, but I'm sure he was like, Oh my God, this guy is following me.
I thought there was something interesting there, how we're all locked in our subjective world views, and we go around projecting a lot on the other person and not really seeing things for what they are.
How did you two first meet?
LEE We actually met through Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. I was doing their pilot "Singularity" for FX, and I had really wanted to work with Steven. Seth and Evan are huge fans of his. [To Yeun] I don't know how they knew you.
STEVEN YEUN I don't either. I guess maybe comic book worlds? Just me being in "Walking Dead" and them being fans of that world. And being gracious people, too, they invited me over to their house one time and properly smoked me out.
LEE So Seth and Evan [introduced Lee and Yeun]. And after that first meeting, we had you and your wife over at our place. I was with my now-wife, and I remember feeling like we were going to know each other for a while. There was just something very comforting and familiar. We have very similar backgrounds.
YEUN We're not from the coasts. And we're Korean. And we're working in this business.
LEE And we both came up in the Korean church.
How did you come up with the character of Danny?
LEE I'm sure there's a lot of me in Danny, but I think there's a lot of all of us in Danny. I knew I wanted this guy to have a chip on his shoulder. I knew he lived in Reseda. I had just bought a home, and I was hearing a lot of funny stories about handymen and contractors shooting themselves in the foot when it comes to their work.
YEUN Danny was an interesting thought experiment -- it was almost therapeutic. How do we see the world when you're living in this space of, like, This place is designed to crush me? I'm pretty sure all of us feel that way to some degree.
What was that like to play for 10 episodes?
YEUN I was pretty exhausted most days; you're kind of living in a hypervigilant state. But I also relate to that life. I never dreamed I would be in this position in this business, and I think that makes you learn how to avoid things that could potentially harm you. For me, that seems like a very immigrant lens.
Have you had road rage?
YEUN Oh for sure. I think anybody who tells you that they haven't is a liar. But my road rage is usually contained in my car.
The series revolves around this relationship between Danny and Amy, but you aren't together physically for much of it. What was that like?
YEUN It was exciting, because you would hear the rumblings of how shooting was going on the other side. And I'm sure she was also hearing the other side. But then every time we would get together, it was very electric.
I could see you and Ali getting into it, just as people.
YEUN There's good electricity between Ali and I.
LEE They're very similar, but opposite in a lot of ways -- I mean that in the best way. We're all close friends but I think when you have that, it does cause electricity.
Much of the series takes place in parts of Los Angeles you rarely see on TV, including a Korean church in the Valley, complete with a praise team.
LEE I've actually known Justin Min [who plays the praise team leader] since he was a kid, because his older brother, Jason, was my best friend in college. When Jason moved out to L.A., Steven, before "The Walking Dead," went to the same church as him and was in the praise team.
Jason actually arranged all the praise team songs in the show, and we prerecorded the music with this amazing producer, Ariel Rechtshaid, who does, like, Beyoncé and Adele. Jason is a pastor now, and he pulled his actual praise team from his church, and there were extras from that church who knew you, remember? There were these little kids going, "Uncle Steven!"
YEUN That week was really fun, because we shot at an actual Korean church in Chatsworth. There was something very nostalgic about that week.
L.A. has always had plenty of road rage, but the problem got even worse during the pandemic. To what extent is this a Covid series?
LEE We wrote it during Covid, and we were seeing headlines like: "Because of Covid, road rage up." So yeah, it was in the air.
But even aside from the rage, the thing that gets exacerbated with Covid is this sense of isolation and loneliness. When Amy talks to George in the intimacy exercise scene about this feeling she's had forever, that came from me telling the writers' room about my own low points. I was talking about my goddaughter, Lily -- she was 4 at the time -- and how I just hope she never has this feeling, and I started crying because it was very sad to think that she's going to have to deal with it. I think that the show is really getting at the core of this feeling that a lot of us can't escape.
Do you ever wonder why you got so mad during the encounter that inspired this show? Or is it a common thing for you?
LEE Um, yeah, I think I should probably reflect on it more.
YEUN I think you've done quite a lot of reflecting!
LEE Well, I've definitely thought a lot about not just that incident but why I am the way I am. And why any of us are.
It's easy, in writing, to point to one thing and be like, Oh, it was this trauma in my past, like, A leads to B leads to C. But that's just not how we work. The lines aren't straight -- it's very wiggly, and there's a lot of stuff. I think that's what the show wants to explore: That it's not one thing. It really is about how hard it is to be alive.
Is that BMW driver going to see a picture of you and go, Hey, that guy made this into a TV show?
LEE No, I was wearing sunglasses.
YEUN Also, that guy probably gets into five of those a day. He's telling somebody off because they didn't go fast enough? That guy lives in that space.

Lawyer's Diary Supports His Self-Defense Claim: [National Desk]

Full text: James R. Ray III, a former Marine, is charged with killing Angela Bledsoe in the home they shared in an affluent New Jersey commuter town.
NEWARK -- The murder case against James R. Ray III was never short on drama.
Mr. Ray, an entertainment lawyer and former Marine, fled to Cuba after Angela Bledsoe, the mother of his then 6-year-old daughter, was found shot to death in 2018 in the home they shared in Montclair, N.J. He was arrested after a weeklong international manhunt.
Then, nearly a year later, parts of an 18-page diary that Mr. Ray wrote in the days after the shooting were read in court, suggesting that he killed Ms. Bledsoe in self-defense but tried to escape because he did not believe a Black man could get a fair trial in the United States.
On Wednesday, after years of delays linked to pandemic shutdowns, his trial began in Essex County Superior Court in Newark. It unfolded theatrically, much like the case itself, with feisty opening statements from Brooke M. Barnett, one of Mr. Ray's two lawyers, and Michele Miller, an assistant prosecutor who lodged a series of objections before a single witness took the stand.
Ms. Barnett told jurors that there was no dispute that her client had fired the fatal shots, but she said he did so in self-defense after Ms. Bledsoe, 44, picked up a gun and pointed it toward him.
"Angela had grown to hate, even despise, have disdain for James," Ms. Barnett said.
"The evidence will show that she picked up the gun, and she pointed it at him in one of her tirades," she added.
Ms. Miller told a far different story as she laid out the prosecution's case to a jury of 11 men and four women.
She presented Mr. Ray as a calculated killer who in the hours after Ms. Bledsoe's death on Oct. 22, 2018, methodically withdrew cash, wrote checks, printed his will and typed a letter to his brother.
Then, she said, he plotted his getaway to Cuba, a country with no extradition treaty with the United States. It was an odyssey that involved a taxi ride to Philadelphia, a cross-country trek by car to Texas, a bus ride into Mexico and airplane flights to Havana, where Mr. Ray was captured as he attempted to clear customs.
"While Angela lay dead on the kitchen floor and their daughter was in school, the defendant began an elaborate plan to get away and disappear," Ms. Miller said after detailing the trajectory of the three bullets that struck Ms. Bledsoe in the chest, face and backside.
Mr. Ray, now 60, has been in jail in Newark awaiting trial since he was charged with murder and weapons possession in the death of Ms. Bledsoe, who worked as a financial consultant in New York City. A graduate of Florida A&M University, she had grown up in Maryland, the youngest of four children, and was known as Angie.
"She was our little baby," Ms. Bledsoe's mother, Gaynelle Bledsoe, 79, said in an interview on Tuesday.
Hours after the shooting, Mr. Ray picked up the couple's daughter, Alana, from a language immersion school in Sterling, N.J., according to testimony. He arranged to leave her with his brother, Robert Ray, who met the two of them in a restaurant in New Jersey.
That night, while getting Alana ready for bed, Robert Ray testified that he found his brother's cellphone and the typed note in his niece's suitcase. He said he cried upon reading it and called the police in Montclair.
"I told them it sounded like, what seemed like, there might have been a murder at his home," Robert Ray testified Wednesday afternoon.
Officers found Ms. Bledsoe's body in the kitchen of the six-bedroom home in Upper Montclair, an affluent section of the township of 41,000 about 20 miles west of Midtown Manhattan.
Soon after, Mr. Ray's BMW was discovered in a parking lot at Newark Liberty International Airport. The search for him was the stuff of movies, with officials from the F.B.I. and the Homeland Security Department celebrating his arrest after an Interpol alert led to his capture in Cuba as he tried to enter that country.
"If you commit a crime in the state of New Jersey, we will not forget, we will not forgive and we will find you," Gregory W. Ehrie, then the special agent in charge of the F.B.I.'s Newark office, said at the time. "The world has become a very small place."
Mr. Ray, who was raised in Brooklyn and spent two years as a New York City police officer before getting his M.B.A. and going to law school, faces life in prison if convicted of killing Ms. Bledsoe.
They met while he was married, Ms. Barnett said, when he hired her to work at an insurance agency he operated. The two began an affair, and Ms. Bledsoe, at 38, became pregnant with Alana, who now lives with Ms. Bledsoe's sister, Lisa LaBoo, in Florida.
A large contingent of Ms. Bledsoe's relatives, classmates from college and Delta Sigma Theta sorority sisters filled the courtroom Wednesday morning. Many wore buttons bearing Ms. Bledsoe's photo and silently wept as grisly details of her death were recited in the wood-paneled courtroom.
At one point, Mr. Ray also appeared to be crying, prompting a court officer to hand him a tissue.
Before the trial, Ms. LaBoo described Ms. Bledsoe as a doting aunt who once flew to London to watch her niece compete in a competition for cheerleading -- a sport that Alana, 10, now also enjoys.
She said she had admired her sister's ability to find God in everyday moments. "When good things would happen during the day she'd say, 'God winked at me today,"' Ms. LaBoo recalled.
"She was beautiful on the inside and out," she added. "We're praying for justice."
Ms. Barnett, however, began crafting a far more complex portrait of Ms. Bledsoe.
At the time of her death, Ms. Bledsoe was involved in a sexual relationship with a married man in Florida, lawyers for Mr. Ray and for the state told the jurors. Her goal, they said, was to join him in Florida.
Prosecutors suggested that this relationship had angered Mr. Ray, whom they depicted as a controlling partner who demeaned Ms. Bledsoe.
But Ms. Barnett instead framed Ms. Bledsoe's two affairs as revealing flaws in her character. Ms. Bledsoe, she said, was an opportunist drawn to Mr. Ray because of his access to a "who's who of the upper echelons of Black society."
And, Ms. Barnett said of Ms. Bledsoe's desire to move to Florida, "she wanted to latch herself to another man." A 9-millimeter gun was found next to Ms. Bledsoe in the kitchen, Ms. Barnett said. The .45-caliber weapon that Ms. Miller said Mr. Ray used to kill Ms. Bledsoe was never found.
While on the witness stand, Robert Ray, Mr. Ray's brother, was asked by Ms. Miller to read from the letter he found in Alana's bag.
In the letter, the defendant wrote that he was about to clean his guns when Ms. Bledsoe picked one up and pointed it at him.
"I reacted in the heat of the moment," James Ray wrote. "I am scared and don't want the long burden of a trial to prove my point."
He encouraged his brother to continue teaching Alana to play golf.
"Let her know that I truly loved her," the letter read.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: His prediction in the 1960s about rapid advances in computer chip technology charted a course for the age of high tech.
Gordon E. Moore, a co-founder and former chairman of Intel Corporation, the California semiconductor chip maker that helped give Silicon Valley its name, achieving the kind of industrial dominance once held by the giant American railroad or steel companies of another age, died on Friday at his home in Hawaii. He was 94.
His death was announced by Intel and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. No cause was specified.
Along with a handful of colleagues, Mr. Moore could claim credit for bringing laptop computers to hundreds of millions of people and embedding microprocessors into everything from bathroom scales, toasters and toy fire engines to cellphones, cars and jets.
Mr. Moore had wanted to be a teacher but could not get a job in education. He later called himself an "accidental entrepreneur, because he became a billionaire as a result of an initial $ 500 investment in the fledgling microchip business, which turned electronics into one of the world's largest industries.
And it was he, his colleagues said, who saw the future. In 1965, in what became known as Moore's Law, he predicted that the number of transistors that could be placed on a silicon chip would double at regular intervals for the foreseeable future, thus increasing the data-processing power of computers exponentially.
He added two corollaries later: The evolving technology would make computers more and more expensive to build, yet consumers would be charged less and less for them because so many would be sold. Moore's Law held up for decades.
Through a combination of Mr. Moore's brilliance, leadership, charisma and contacts, as well as that of his partner and Intel co-founder, Robert Noyce, the two assembled a group widely regarded as among the boldest and most creative technicians of the high-tech age.
This was the group that advocated the use of the thumbnail-thin chips of silicon, a highly polished, chemically treated sandy substance -- one of the most common natural resources on earth -- because of what turned out to be silicon's amazing hospitality in housing smaller and smaller electronic circuitry that could work at higher and higher speeds.
With its silicon microprocessors, the brains of a computer, Intel enabled American manufacturers in the mid-1980s to regain the lead in the vast computer data-processing field from their formidable Japanese competitors. By the '90s, Intel had placed its microprocessors in 80 percent of the computers that were being made worldwide, becoming the most successful semiconductor company in history.
Much of this happened under Mr. Moore's watch. He was chief executive from 1975 to 1987, when Andrew Grove succeeded him, and remained chairman until 1997.
As his wealth grew, Mr. Moore also became a major figure in philanthropy. In 2001, he and his wife created the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation with a donation of 175 million Intel shares. In 2001, they donated $ 600 million to the California Institute of Technology, the largest single gift to an institution of higher learning at the time. The foundation's assets currently exceed $ 8 billion, and it has given away more than $ 5 billion since its founding.
In interviews, Mr. Moore was characteristically humble about his achievements, particularly the technical advances that Moore's Law made possible.
"What I could see was that semiconductor devices were the way electronics were going to become cheap. That was the message I was trying to get across," he told the journalist Michael Malone in 2000. "It turned out to be an amazingly precise prediction -- a lot more precise than I ever imagined it would be."
Not only was Mr. Moore predicting that electronics would become much cheaper over time, as the industry shifted away from discrete transistors and tubes to silicon microchips; over the years his prediction proved so reliable that technology firms based their product strategy on the assumption that Moore's Law would hold.
"Any business doing rational multiyear planning had to assume this rate of change or else get steamrolled," said Harry Saal, a longtime Silicon Valley entrepreneur.
Arthur Rock, an early investor in Intel and friend of Mr. Moore's, said: "That's his legacy. It's not Intel. It's not the Moore Foundation. It's that phrase: Moore's Law."
Gordon Earl Moore was born on Jan. 3, 1929, in San Francisco. He grew up in Pescadero, a small coastal town south of San Francisco, where his father, Walter, was deputy sheriff and the family of his mother, Florence Almira (Williamson) Moore, ran the general store.
Mr. Moore enrolled at San Jose State College (now San José State University), where he met Betty Whitaker, a journalism student. They married in 1950. That same year, he completed his undergraduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, with a degree in chemistry. In 1954, he received his doctorate, also in chemistry, from Caltech.
One of the first jobs he applied for was as a manager with Dow Chemical. "They sent me to a psychologist to see how this would fit," Mr. Moore wrote in Engineering & Science magazine in 1994. "The psychologist said I was OK technically but I'd never manage anything."
So Mr. Moore took a position with the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Then, looking for a way back to California, he interviewed at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in Livermore, Calif. He was offered a job, he wrote, "but I decided I didn't want to take spectra of exploding nuclear bombs, so I turned it down."
Instead, in 1956, Mr. Moore joined William Shockley, a co-inventor of the transistor, to work at a West Coast division of Bell Laboratories, a start-up unit whose aim was to make a cheap silicon transistor.
But the company, Shockley Semiconductor, foundered under Dr. Shockley, who had no experience running a company. In 1957, Mr. Moore and Mr. Noyce joined a group of defectors who came to be known as "the traitorous eight." With each putting in $ 500, along with $ 1.3 million in backing from the aircraft pioneer Sherman Fairchild, the eight men left to form the Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation, which became a pioneer in manufacturing integrated circuits.
Bitten by the entrepreneurial bug, Mr. Moore and Mr. Noyce decided in 1968 to form their own company, focusing on semiconductor memory. They wrote what Mr. Moore described as a "very general" business plan.
"It said we were going to work with silicon," he said in 1994, "and make interesting products."
Their vague proposal notwithstanding, they had no trouble finding financial backing.
With $ 2.5 million in capital (the equivalent of about $ 22 million today), Mr. Moore and Mr. Noyce called their start-up Integrated Electronics Corporation, a name they later shortened to Intel. The third employee was Mr. Grove, a young Hungarian immigrant who had worked under Mr. Moore at Fairchild.
After some indecision around what technology to focus on, the three men settled on a new version of MOS (metal oxide semiconductor) technology called silicon-gate MOS. To interconnect multiple transistors on a single piece of silicon, they deposited aluminum wires on top, creating an integrated circuit.
"Fortunately, very much by luck, we had hit on a technology that had just the right degree of difficulty for a successful start-up," Mr. Moore wrote. "This was how Intel began."
In the early 1970s, Intel's 4000 series "computer on a chip" began the revolution in personal computers -- although Intel itself missed the opportunity to manufacture a PC, for which Mr. Moore partly blamed his own shortsightedness.
"Long before Apple, one of our engineers came to me with the suggestion that Intel ought to build a computer for the home," he recalled. "And I asked him, 'What the heck would anyone want a computer for in his home?"'
Still, he saw the future. In 1963, while at Fairchild as director of research and development, Mr. Moore contributed a chapter to a book that described what was to become the precursor to his eponymous law, without the explicit numerical prediction. Two years later, he published an article in Electronics, a widely circulated trade magazine, titled "Cramming More Components Onto Integrated Circuits."
"The article presented the same argument as the book chapter, with the addition of this explicitly numerical prediction," said David Brock, a co-author of "Moore's Law: The Life of Gordon Moore, Silicon Valley's Quiet Revolutionary" (2015).
There is little evidence that many people read the article when it was published, Mr. Brock said.
"He kept giving talks with these charts and plots, and people started using his slides and reproducing his graphs," Mr. Brock said. "Then people saw the phenomenon happen. Silicon microchips got more complex, and their cost went down."
In the 1960s, when Mr. Moore began in electronics, a single silicon transistor sold for $ 150. Later, $ 10 would buy more than 100 million transistors. Mr. Moore once wrote that if cars advanced as quickly as computers, "they would get 100,000 miles to the gallon and it would be cheaper to buy a Rolls-Royce than park it. (Cars would also be a half an inch long.)"
Mr. Moore's survivors include his wife; two sons, Kenneth and Steven; and four grandchildren.
In 2014, Forbes estimated Mr. Moore's net worth at $ 7 billion. Yet he remained unprepossessing throughout his life, preferring tattered shirts and khakis to tailored suits. He shopped at Costco and kept a collection of fly lures and fishing reels on his office desk.
Moore's Law is bound to reach its end, as engineers encounter some basic physical limits, as well as the extreme cost of building factories to achieve the next level of miniaturization. And in recent years, the pace of miniaturization has slowed.
Mr. Moore himself commented from time to time on the inevitable end of Moore's Law. "It can't continue forever," he said in a 2005 interview with Techworld magazine. "The nature of exponentials is that you push them out and eventually disaster happens."

Full text: MEMPHIS -- As he drove to work on a summer afternoon in Memphis last year, Ralph Jones saw a woman on the sidewalk flagging him down. Thinking she was in distress or needed a ride, Mr. Jones said, he pulled over.
After a brief conversation in which she tried to lure him to a nearby motel, Mr. Jones said, he drove away but was soon stopped by the police and yanked from his truck. The 70-year-old welder said that with just 86 cents in his pocket, he had neither the intent nor the money to solicit a prostitute, as the officers were claiming.
His protests were to no avail. Mr. Jones was cited, and his truck, along with the expensive tools inside, was seized. The charges were eventually dropped, but the truck and his work equipment remained corralled in a city impound lot for six weeks, when prosecutors finally agreed to return it in exchange for a $ 750 payment.
"It's nothing but a racket," Mr. Jones said.
Police departments around the country have long used asset forfeiture laws to seize property believed to be associated with criminal activity, a tactic intended to deprive lawbreakers of ill-gotten gains, deter future crimes and, along the way, provide a lucrative revenue source for police departments.
But it became a favored law-enforcement tactic in Memphis, where the elite street crime unit involved in the death of Tyre Nichols on Jan. 7, known as the Scorpion unit, was among several law enforcement teams in the city making widespread use of vehicle seizures.
Like Mr. Jones, some of the people affected by the seizures had not been convicted of any crime, and defense lawyers said they disproportionately affected low-income residents, and people of color.
Over the past decade, civil rights advocates in several states have successfully pushed to make it harder for the police to seize property, but Tennessee continues to have some of the most aggressive seizure laws in the country.
While some states now require a criminal conviction before forfeiting property, Tennessee's process can be much looser, requiring only that the government show, in a civil process, that the property was more likely than not to have been connected to certain types of criminal activity -- a less rigorous burden of proof. Tennessee allows local law enforcement agencies to keep the bulk of the proceeds of the assets they seize.
And the process for getting property back in the state can be prohibitive for those who have little money or the ability to hire a lawyer: Those who fail to file a claim and post a $ 350 bond within 30 days automatically forfeit their property.
"Tennessee's forfeiture laws are among the nation's worst," said Lisa Knepper, a senior director of strategic research at the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit law firm that has called for changes in state and federal forfeiture laws.
In Memphis, some of the more than 700 vehicles seized last year were taken from people who were ultimately found guilty of serious criminal charges. But other residents reported in interviews that they were compelled to pay large fees to recover their vehicles even when they had not been convicted of any crime.
In 2021, the Memphis Police Chief, Cerelyn Davis, came forward with the city's plan to combat growing incidents of reckless driving and drag racing with vehicle seizures. This happened at around the same time that the city was launching the Scorpion unit -- an acronym for the department's Street Crimes Operation to Restore Peace in Our Neighborhoods.
No longer would police officers be merely issuing citations to reckless drivers who endangered others, she said, seeming to acknowledge that such seizures might not ultimately stand up in court.
"When we identify individuals that are reckless driving to a point where they put other lives in danger, we want to take your car, too," she said. "Take the car. Even if the case gets dropped in court. We witnessed it. You did it. You might be inconvenienced for three days without your car. That's enough."
Mayor Jim Strickland was also a strong supporter of the seizure policy and even proposed destroying cars used by drag racers and other reckless drivers. "I don't care if they serve a day in jail," he said last year. "Let me get their cars, and then once a month we'll line them all up, maybe at the old fairgrounds, Liberty Park, and just smash them."
Police officers said it was on suspicion of reckless driving that they first pulled over Mr. Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man who died after a long and brutal beating by Scorpion officers. Five officers have been charged with murder in the case. Chief Davis subsequently said that she had seen nothing to support the reckless driving allegation. Nichols's car was taken to the city's impound lot.
The Scorpion unit was touted for its record of seizing drugs, cash and cars. In just the first few months of its operations, the city reported that the elite unit had seized some 270 vehicles.
Many of the vehicle seizures have revolved around drugs. In those instances, according to several defense lawyers, the agency often seized a vehicle based on a claim that it was being used in a drug-dealing operation -- a common basis for such seizures in many cities, intended to deprive drug dealers of their profits and the ability to continue their work.
But even some of those not convicted of a crime said they spent weeks without a car while trying to navigate a complicated court process.
Filing a claim in court requires posting a $ 350 bond. Sometimes, defense lawyers said, the authorities managing the case may offer to release the car without requiring a court hearing if a person pays a fee that can amount to thousands of dollars.
Shawn Douglas Jr. lost his car in the fall after being stopped at a Memphis gas station by officers who reported finding two clear baggies containing marijuana inside a backpack.
Mr. Douglas was soon in handcuffs, arrested on suspicion of a felony drug infraction, an allegation he denied. His car was sent to impound.
In an interview, Mr. Douglas said one of the arresting officers commented to him about his 2015 Dodge Charger: "He said, 'That would be a great police vehicle. When we take those vehicles we hope people don't come get them back so we can do drug busts out of them."'
Months later, Mr. Douglas's criminal charges had been dropped, but his car was still in police custody. He was only able to recover it after paying $ 925, records show; crews towed it out to a dusty lot and handed it over to him, its battery dead. Mr. Douglas had to struggle with battery cables to get it started.
"It cost a lot of money," Mr. Douglas said. "It puts you back on everything and creates more stress. When you can't pay bills, you can't do anything."
Neither the police department nor the district attorney's office responded to questions about the forfeiture cases of Mr. Douglas and others interviewed for this article, and they only briefly addressed the city's forfeiture policy.
In Memphis, as in many cities, revenues from such impound and forfeiture fees are returned to support policing activities, becoming a regular source of revenue.
Memphis has not disclosed how much money it generated for the hundreds of vehicles that were forfeited. The city did report seizing some $ 1.7 million in cash last year, winning forfeiture of nearly $ 1.3 million.
This income is most often being generated from the city's poorest residents, defense lawyers said.
"It's unfair to a lot of the poorer citizens in Memphis," said Arthur Horne, who has represented such clients. "It's a huge tax."
Vehicle seizures have never been a priority in the city's overall crime-fighting strategy, Chief Davis said in a brief interview, adding that any money gained from forfeitures was not essential to police operations.
"We haven't put a high level of priority on asset forfeiture here in Memphis," she said. "We put more of a priority on violent crime, reducing violent crime."
"It's not like we're out trying to seize vehicles. We have a budget to support the police department."
Erica R. Williams, the communications director for the Shelby County District Attorney's Office, says that prosecutors do not receive any share in proceeds from vehicle forfeitures.
"We attempt to handle these cases as quickly as possible in an effort to minimize the difficulty caused by the seizure of a vehicle, while simultaneously seeking to accomplish the spirit of the statute," she said, which was to "discourage engagement in future offenses."
Seven states do not give forfeiture revenues to law enforcement. A few states, such as New Mexico, Maine and North Carolina, do not permit civil proceedings and allow forfeiture only after criminal convictions.
A bill pending in Congress proposes a series of new rules that would raise the standards for the government to win forfeiture, give access to lawyers for people trying to recover their property and end profit incentives by sending revenues to the Treasury Department's general fund.
John Flynn, the president of the National District Attorneys Association, said efforts seeking to limit forfeitures have at times brought together lawmakers on the left and the libertarian right. But he said such efforts could go too far, undermining a law-enforcement tool that he said provides a deterrent to wrongdoers and turns over illegal criminal profits to those trying to fight crime.
"From a prosecutor's standpoint, any money or vehicles or property gained through illegal conduct should be forfeited," Mr. Flynn said.
He said safeguards allowed people to present evidence that their property was not acquired through illegal means.
In Memphis, at the city's crowded impound lot north of town, cars towed in from around the city for various reasons mix with recovered stolen vehicles and cars seized by the police. Tow trucks buzz in regularly, and a fine coat of dust from a nearby limestone supply company settles over everything.
A dozen shoppers were on hand one recent morning looking at a GMC Denali that was up for auction. It looked to be in mint condition on the passenger side, but 20 or so bullet holes dotted the driver's side door.
Further down the lot, Kyle Lyons was standing next to a pile of belongings that he had retrieved from his 2010 BMW, which had been seized in July by police officers who said they had found heroin in the vehicle. Mr. Lyons, who said he had struggled with addiction, was hoping to get back thousands of dollars worth of Craftsman tools that had been taken along with the car -- equipment he needed to work.
Once his car was gone, he said, he had lost nearly everything else.
"Everything I use to make money with was gone," Mr. Lyons said. "I couldn't work, couldn't go out and buy no more. I was homeless for four months."
He has left Memphis and moved home to Kentucky. His car is still impounded.

Three Convicted in Murder Of Rapper XXXTentacion Will Face Life in Prison: [National Desk]

Full text: After more than 27 hours of deliberation, a Florida jury found three men guilty of killing the rising rapper during a robbery in the parking lot of a motorcycle shop.
Nearly five years after the killing of the rising rap star XXXTentacion, who was fatally shot in broad daylight during a 2018 robbery just as his polarizing career was exploding, a jury in Florida on Monday ended more than a week of deliberations when it found three men guilty of first-degree murder in the case.
Prosecutors said that Michael Boatwright, 28, and Trayvon Newsome, 24, were the gunmen that June afternoon, with Boatwright firing the fatal shot during a struggle over money. The third man convicted, Dedrick Williams, 26, was said to be the getaway driver and mastermind behind the robbery.
All three face mandatory life sentences; prosecutors did not seek the death penalty in the case, which was tried at the Broward County Courthouse in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
Surveillance video played in court showed the rapper's BMW being blocked by an S.U.V. as he tried to leave a motor sports store in Deerfield Beach, Fla., leading to a confrontation with two masked assailants, who escaped with $ 50,000 in cash.
The trial turned largely on the jury's interpretation of testimony from a fourth man present that day, Robert Allen, who pleaded guilty to second-degree murder last year and testified against his alleged co-conspirators. The Broward County prosecutors also relied on surveillance video from the store that showed two of the men inside, seemingly observing XXXTentacion (born Jahseh Onfroy), as well as cellphone and Bluetooth data tying the men to the location and the S.U.V.
The evidence also included videos that prosecutors said showed the defendants dancing and posing with cash hours after the killing.
During more than 27 hours of deliberations across eight days, jurors had asked to review more than 1,000 text messages, along with photos and videos, seized from the cellphones of two of the defendants, including a picture of a news story about the shooting.
Defense lawyers for Boatwright, Newsome and Williams, who were tried together, argued that DNA evidence failed to link them to the shooting. (The jury was asked to decide separately on each man's guilt or innocence, and could have convicted just one or two of those accused.)
The defense pointed vaguely to other theories of the crime -- including behind-the-scenes wrangling that attempted to include information about XXXTentacion's online beef with the megastar Drake, who fought successfully to avoid being deposed in the case. They also said that Allen, who had previous felony convictions, was an unreliable witness.
"Plans hatched in hell do not have angels for witnesses," Pascale Achille, the lead prosecutor, said in her rebuttal after closing arguments.
The foursome had been planning to commit robberies that day, prosecutors argued, when they happened upon XXXTentacion at the motorcycle shop, where they had hoped to buy a mask. After confirming the musician's identity inside, the men then waited for him in the parking lot and pulled in front of his car, allowing the two gunmen to attack, their faces covered. A passenger riding with XXXTentacion fled, and a scuffle over the rapper's Louis Vuitton bag containing the $ 50,000 ended when Boatwright shot the rapper, prosecutors said.
XXXTentacion, 20, a singer, songwriter and rapper who blended genres and first took off on the streaming platform SoundCloud, was high up on the roller coaster of viral fame when he was killed.
In the 18 months before the shooting, he had gone from a little-known, troubled teenager making music in his bedroom to the top of the Billboard chart thanks to the success of his anarchic breakout single, "Look at Me!," and a follow-up album, "?," which debuted at No. 1.
At the same time, he was awaiting trial on charges of battery, false imprisonment and witness tampering stemming from the alleged violent assault of a former girlfriend.
"If I'm going to die or ever be a sacrifice, I want to make sure that my life made at least five million kids happy, or they found some sort of answers or resolve in my life, regardless of the negative around my name, regardless of the bad things people say to me," the rapper said in a video posted to social media before his death.
Since his killing, XXXTentacion -- whose striking visage has been absorbed into modern hip-hop's iconography -- has been the subject of a documentary, "Look at Me," and been featured on albums by Kanye West and Lil Wayne, in addition to the posthumous music released in his name.

Where $250,000 Gets You Dinner: [Style Desk]

Full text: Inside the exclusive dinner clubs in South Florida, where money talks and Donald Trump sometimes plays D.J.
PALM BEACH, Fla. -- If you plan to dine at a hot spot in Palm Beach this season, pack clothing so bright that it might be radioactive. Why? Sartorial armor is practically required in any exclusive enclave. And Palm Beach is all about fitting in and showing you belong.
The peer pressure is intensifying. During the early years of the pandemic, there was a 20 percent increase in New Yorkers moving to Florida compared with the average of the previous eight years, according to I.R.S. immigration data. They are chasing good health, sunshine, Florida's no-income-tax status and, for the wealthiest among them, the elusive private club membership.
"No one can get a dinner reservation, so people are focused on joining the clubs," said Ryan Williams, a public affairs executive and former strategist for Mitt Romney. "There are two types of private clubs that new residents hope to join, with different purposes. The traditional country clubs cater to families with tennis, golf and a beach. The private dining clubs offer no amenities -- members come for an elegant locale to drink, dine and dance with people they know or want to know. Both are impossible to get into now."
Initiation fees for dining clubs are $ 10,000 to $ 250,000, and mounting as demand rises.
Acquiring a golden ticket to Palm Beach country clubs with golf or tennis can take years: Long waiting lists, piles of required recommendations from members, and persnickety committees drunk on power all slow the acceptance process. But memberships to the dining clubs can be fast-tracked if the applicant knows the owners or key members.
The dining club expansion in Palm Beach mirrors the trend among upper-crust urban sets across the country. At Casa Cruz in New York, San Vicente Bungalows in Los Angeles or the new Carriage House in Palm Beach, members have monthly house accounts and never suffer through a delayed table reservation.
"Think about it, all the New Yorkers who were going to Nell's or Au Bar in the '80s and '90s have kids who've now flown the coop," said Tom Shaffer, a former advertising executive who has been a fixture in Palm Beach social life for years. He playfully picks his slacks based on the Geiger counter clicks the fabric emits. "These people haven't changed all that much -- they finally have time for fun. So why not drink and dance in a fabulous supper club with friends rather than try to book a table in a packed restaurant?"
Mr. Shaffer is on point. The most popular Palm Beach restaurants require a slap-on-the-back relationship with the owner unless a reservation on a distant Tuesday at 5 p.m. in the Siberia section works for you.
The One That 'Checks All the Boxes'
This season, the Carriage House popped up as the sexy, white-hottest private supper club. Members, many from New York and Europe, have paid fees of about $ 250,000. How to rationalize the six-figure fee for a guaranteed table in a crowded town? "You just had to do it" is a common refrain.
At the entrance to the Carriage House, women in matching blue dresses and gold lizard necklaces escort diners to the blue-lacquered clear liquor bar serving 20 varieties of gin. "The décor is inviting with a British twist," the designer Tommy Hilfiger said. "It's well run, the food is amazing, and the colors are very appealing. It's modern Palm Beach, so it has a tropical flavor and a chic look. It checks all the boxes."
Bars, reading rooms and dining areas at the Carriage House are encased in lacquer or fabric walls, modeled on private dining clubs in London. The preppy paisleys, boho prints and silk velvets meld like instruments conducted in symphonic union. Outside, if not for the banana-yellow Rolls-Royce gliding down the street at a daring 12 miles per hour, you'd think you were on Berkeley Square in London.
The One That Doesn't Rock the Boat
For those preferring to remember they are in Palm Beach, Dan Ponton is stationed, as he has been for 40 years, inside his Club Colette. His old-time establishment exudes the notion "Sometimes you just don't need to rock the boat."
Club Colette is right in town, with a Regency-style white stucco mansion behind a high hedge, and an initiation fee of $ 20,000 to $ 30,000. It's Palm Beach pretty inside: Easter egg hues, soft drapes, a sunlit glass terrace room overlooking a latticed garden. By the side, a trellis of ivy and orchids hovers over intimate outdoor tables.
Many waiters and bartenders have worked there for decades. "I walk in and see friends that I haven't seen for a while," said the philanthropist Sharon Bush, a member and the former sister-in-law of former President George W. Bush. "They are busy during the day, and it's a great time to gather at night."
Mr. Ponton said he has figured out the secret sauce of ages and backgrounds. "Now, there is a newer generation moving down that longs to have anchors. Face it, you can't get a social anchor in Mykonos," he said. "This is a small town. Colette is private and allows me to mix groups. That's what I do for a living."
The One Where You Just Need to Know the Owner
Down South County Road, a few blocks from Worth Avenue, stands Buccan, a restaurant that has become yet another version of a private club. Word has it that no one gets a table in any season without knowing the owner, Piper Quinn.
Mr. Quinn's father, Tom Quinn, a partner at the Venable law firm in Washington who worked in college on John F. Kennedy's 1960 campaign, has zipped up and down the Newport-Georgetown-Palm Beach axis for 50 years. He holds court at Buccan most nights after 8, calmly sipping his pinot grigio. Men slap his back with a little too much gusto, many pretending they are his dearest friends. He quipped: "The S&P may be down, but my bloodline to the owner means my personal stock is up 10x."
The One Where Trump Picks the Music
And finally, the megillah that is Mar-a-Lago offers all of the above and more, and then even more than that. Housed in an estate built in 1926 by Marjorie Meriweather Post, a General Foods heiress, and modeled on the Alhambra in Granada, Spain, it has 118 rooms and sits on 20 acres. With its yellow and white awnings, tennis, golf, pool and beach, Mar-a-Lago is in the country club category, with an initiation fee of $ 200,000.
Mar-a-Lago has a far livelier nighttime aura than other clubs, and a veranda overlooking the pool with a boisterous bar on the right, even midweek. Let's call it a country club and a dining club rolled into one. Around town, there is no general conversation about getting in, but some members qualify by saying, "The spa is to die for," or, "I just play golf, and I'm not political." Others stay real: "I like him, and I like the damn club!"
The crowd appears dominated by American men who might be football coaches and their dressy wives who wear darker cocktail outfits than the more common pink and green -- they all seemed pumped up and ready for action. A current member who sometimes votes Democratic contends the club is "fun as hell." (So fun that he declined to go on the record for fear of losing his membership.)
Members enter through a front foyer and stroll past an oil portrait of former President Donald J. Trump, soon emerging into a cavernous wood-paneled club room with gold ceilings and Moorish tiling. A white piano fit for Liberace stands in the far corner with a sign advising members not to touch it. Across the room, steps lead to a throne-style area flanked by two five-foot inlaid vases. The doors on the right lead to the dining veranda, where Mr. Trump frequently bids good evening to the ladies and fist-bumps the gentlemen, often exclaiming, "My man!"
One weekday night, amid 1920s fountains with swans spewing water into the center, Mr. Trump and his wife, Melania, dined at a rope-encircled table on the sprawling deck with two women dressed more appropriately for a school board meeting than dinner in a resort town. Someone at the bar wondered if they'd won the "Dinner with Trump" sweepstakes that came with a Rambo Trump NFT.
At the bar, an uncommonly extroverted man in a strawberry pink jacket talked to people he didn't seem to know beside him, yammering on and joking. His arms, neck and torso were festooned in jewelry, which he said was from Jacob the Jeweler, known as the "King of Bling." Every ornament on his body was encrusted in diamonds: On his neck, a rope-shaped necklace appeared sturdy enough to secure a Carnival cruise ship at the dock.
Over on the veranda Mr. Trump took out an iPad that is connected to the club's speaker system. First, he played "Wild Horses" by the Rolling Stones, then an Andrea Bocelli ballad. Downstairs at a ballroom off the pool, a professional dancing couple encouraged revelers to "boogie oogie oogie." Women danced in hyperactive bachelorette kinds of groups, while the men in jackets, some in shiny silk shirts, swayed with more adult decorum. There was no ambiguity as to whether members enjoyed themselves as they drank, danced and cavorted until the wee hours of the night.

Mel Brooks Isn’t Done Punching Up the History of the World

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Mel Brooks is a sophisticated guy. He collected fancy French wines and did a tasting on Johnny Carson’s show. He drops references to Nikolai Gogol’s “Dead Souls.” He was married for 40 years to that epitome of elegance, Anne Bancroft. He was a favorite lunch companion of Cary Grant, the suavest man who ever lived.
But in the new Hulu show “History of the World, Part II,” you can still find all the Mel Brooks signature comedy stylings: penis jokes, puke jokes and fart jokes.
“I like fart jokes,” he said, Zooming from his home in Santa Monica, California. “It adds some je ne sais quoi to the comedy. A touch of sophistication for the smarter people helps move the show along.”
After all, with the percussive campfire scene in his 1974 comedy classic, “Blazing Saddles,” where the cowhands sit around eating beans and passing wind, he elevated flatulence to cinematic history.
The comedy legend, 96, preferred to meet on Zoom because he’s wary of COVID. Strangers love to hug him and say, “Mel, I love you!” he said, adding, “I’m a target.”
The man behind outlandish, hilarious movies like “The Producers,” “Young Frankenstein,” “Spaceballs,” “High Anxiety,” “Robin Hood: Men in Tights” and “History of the World, Part I,” along with the hit TV spy comedy “Get Smart,” no longer lives in a time when he can have “absolutely no restrictions on any and all subjects,” as he said about writing “Blazing Saddles” (which was slapped with its own content warning in 2020 when it was on HBO Max). And he lost the two loves of his life, Bancroft and Carl Reiner. But Mel Brooks is still a ball of fire.
Having lived through nearly a century of history, Brooks is sneaking up on his famous character, the 2,000 Year Old Man. But his taste in comedy is still as merrily immature as ever. He has sharp takes on world history, greed and hypocrisy. He knows who the villains are and what the stakes are, and yet he’s not afraid of the lowbrow.
Max Brooks, his son with Bancroft, said his father’s mantra is: “If you’re going to climb the tower, ring the bell.”
“He believes if you’re going to make a piece of art, don’t be safe, don’t be careful, don’t pander to a certain group to win their favor.”
Mel Brooks is still making fun of Hitler. The new show has a sketch called “Hitler on Ice,” with three TV commentators savaging an ice-skating Führer who falls. One sniffs, “I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: If you put concentration camps in people’s countries, you better be flawless on the ice.”
Using Comedy as a Weapon
Brooks’ parents were immigrants, his mother from Ukraine and his father from Germany. His father died of tuberculosis when Brooks was 2; there was no money to send him to a sanitarium, Max Brooks said. When the little boy, born Melvin Kaminsky, needed fillings for his teeth that would have cost a dollar apiece, his mother could not afford it, so she had to let the dentist rip them out for half price.
He fought in the U.S. Army against the Nazis and dealt with antisemitism among some of his fellow soldiers. He said he felt like Errol Flynn when he got instruction on cavalry charges with horses and sabers. He was a corporal, a combat engineer who defused land mines and cleared booby-trapped buildings in France and Germany. (He was in the German town of Baumholder on V-E Day.) His three brothers also fought in the war and one, Lenny, a pilot, ended up a prisoner in a Nazi POW camp for 19 months, where he had to pretend he wasn’t Jewish.
“I was on a troop ship, and I paid a sailor on deck $50 to let me sleep under a lifeboat in case we were torpedoed,” Brooks recalled. “The smells were dreadful, 500 guys on a ship. It was 16 or 17 days from the Navy yard in Brooklyn to Le Havre, France, zigzagging and trying not to get torpedoed.”
And ever since the war, he said, “I’ve tried to get even with Hitler by taking the Mickey out of him, making fun, but it’s difficult.”
Brooks, who was sometimes bullied as a child, learned to use comedy as a weapon. When his musical version of “The Producers” in 2001 — with a swanning, singing and dancing Hitler — held a preview in Chicago, “some big guy kept storming up the aisle and saying: ‘How dare you have Hitler? How dare you have the swastika? I was in World War II risking my life, and you do this on a stage?’ I said, ‘I was in World War II, and I didn’t see you there.’”
“History of the World, Part I,” the 1981 movie on which the Hulu series is riffing, was a raunchy romp through different eras, from the Stone Age to the French Revolution. It featured the peerless Madeline Kahn as Empress Nympho, Nero’s wife; Sid Caesar as the cave man who invented music and the spear but could not quite figure out fire; and Brooks in multiple roles. He played Comicus, the stand-up philosopher; a singing Torquemada with a bevy of synchronized swimmers; and a libidinous Louis XVI, having his way with women and crowing, “It’s good to be the king.”
It was chockablock with puns, including the classic in which Harvey Korman, as the Count de Monet, chastised his impudent companion, “Don’t be saucy with me, Béarnaise.”
Brooks tacked on “Part I” to the title as a joke, he said, but then “I was plagued with about a billion calls, ‘Where’s Part II?’ I never intended to do Part II.”
But he and his producing partner, Kevin Salter, eventually gave in to popular demand. Brooks said he thought: “What the hell? Let’s try Part II.” They reached out to comedian Nick Kroll in 2020. He recruited Wanda Sykes, Ike Barinholtz and showrunner David Stassen. “I’ve been laughing at comedy, some of which I didn’t create,” Brooks said, “which is very weird for me.” The writers did remind themselves, though, as Sykes said, to “Mel it up.”
Once the ball got rolling, all the comedians who idolized Brooks wanted in — from Johnny Knoxville (who plays Rasputin getting his attenuated member cut off) to Sarah Silverman (who is in a “Jews in space” skit previewed in Part I with the song “Jews, out in space, we’re zooming along, protecting the Hebrew race”) to Jack Black (a sneaky Stalin).
Knoxville said that Brooks is “the legend of legends,” who pushes things as far as possible (which is also the “Jackass” way). He got to talk to his idol on the phone one night. “I was shaking before and during and after,” Knoxville said. “I don’t know if he got a word in edgewise.”
Knoxville thinks he saw Rasputin’s “Jim Dog,” as he called the body part, pronouncing it “Dawg,” in a jar in St. Petersburg, Russia, at the Museum of Erotica. It’s not clear if the castration of the concupiscent mystic was mere legend, but in the “History of the World” universe, Brooks is happy to go with the legend.
“Before Mel, I don’t think movies were hilarious,” Barinholtz said. “Before ‘Blazing Saddles,’ regular people were not going to the movie theater and laughing so hard they were hyperventilating. Mel, I think, really ushered that in.” He and some of the other comedians who worked on the show had not met Brooks before, Barinholtz said, adding, “He inspected our teeth and could tell that we were strong.”
Brooks himself narrates the film, with a muscly CGI body. I asked how he compared with the original narrator, Orson Welles. Brooks gave the contest to Welles: “He said, ‘I want $25,000 in a paper bag and please don’t mention it to my agent.’ I said, ‘What are you going to do with that $25,000 in the paper bag?’ He said, ‘Beluga caviar and the finest Cuban cigars.’”
Galileo on Social Media
Brooks helped the comedians decide which slices of history to explore in the sequel, and joined the Zoom writers’ room sometimes to weigh pitches or offer jokes from his vault of unused material.
“The first time we talked, he was like, ‘I have an idea for this joke where Robert E. Lee is at Appomattox and he turns to sign and his sword knocks his guys in the balls,’” Kroll said. “Then when we decided to do a whole section on Ulysses S. Grant and the signing at Appomattox, we were like: ‘Perfect. We can do that joke.’”
And like Part I, in which Comicus pulls up in a chariot to Caesar’s palace during the Roman Empire but it turns out to be the Las Vegas Caesars Palace, Part II has plenty of fun anachronisms, like Galileo on “TicciTocci” or Harriet Tubman’s Underground Railroad morphing into the New York subway.
Barinholtz said Brooks’ instruction was: “Don’t get too esoteric. Play the hits.” He said they didn’t use the racial and sexual epithets that peppered Brooks’ movies in the 1960s, ’70s and ’80s but they stuck to the same themes.
In one episode, a Native American Civil War soldier played by Zahn McClarnon has to do a stand-up routine to distract a bunch of West Virginia racists who are trying to hang Grant, played by Barinholtz. Noting that the colonizers had built Ohio on top of his razed family home, the soldier advised, “If you’re going to genocide a people, you should get something better out of it than Cleveland.”
Brooks, too, said he would no longer use the inflammatory words he used so freely back in the day. I asked him about his fellow comics — like Chris Rock, Bill Maher and Jerry Seinfeld — who worry that wokeness is neutering comedy.
He looked over at Salter, who was sitting beside him. “I had a talk with Kevin before this,” he told me. “He said, ‘If Maureen, for some reason, brings up woke and woke comedy, stay off it. Stay away.’ ”
Laughing, I conceded, “I’m so obvious.”
“Yes,” he replied. “Absolutely.”
He endorsed Joe Biden in 2020, but he said he doesn’t like to do political comedy because then “half the audience is going to be angry at me.” He prefers jokes like this one from the new show about the Virgin Mary: “She thinks her son is God. The mother’s definitely Jewish.”
Why are so many of the most storied comedians Jewish?
“Well, I don’t think they let them into railroads,” he said, laughing. “If you were a Jew, you couldn’t own a railroad.”
Is he surprised antisemitism is on the rise?
“Why would you want to be anti-Jewish after those stories about concentration camps?” he said. “How could you be?”
I asked Larry David, who did a whole season of “Curb Your Enthusiasm” revolving around “The Producers” — with cameos by Brooks and Bancroft — why Brooks sits atop the comedy pantheon.
“It’s almost as if he was designed in Silicon Valley,” David said. “What would the funniest man in the world look and sound like? And they came up with Mel.”
The Greatest Writers’ Rooms in History
My first memory of laughing until I cried was sitting on Saturday nights watching Sid Caesar cavort on “Caesar’s Hour,” the sequel to “Your Show of Shows.” Brooks wrote for both, as part of the most famous writers’ rooms in TV history.
Brooks worked in those rooms with Mel Tolkin, the head writer; Carl Reiner; Neil Simon; Larry Gelbart (“the fastest mouth and brain in the West,” as Brooks called him, who went on to do “M*A*S*H” and “Tootsie”); Lucille Kallen, one of the first women writing for television, who did the domestic sketches for “Your Show of Shows”; Aaron Ruben (who later produced “The Andy Griffith Show”); and a very young Woody Allen.
Was he jealous of the prelapsarian Allen?
“I was, but this is the first time I’ve ever mentioned it,” he said, with a mock grimace. “I said: ‘That little mouse. That little rat. How did he come up with that?’ Woody would come up with a lot of stuff. He was sly, and he was a brilliant writer.”
He said that Simon, known as Doc Simon, “had a very pale, light, little voice, which sometimes drove us crazy. Carl Reiner would sit next to him, and Doc would whisper his jokes into Carl’s left ear, and Carl would stand up and say, ‘Doc has it.’ And it would be wonderful.”
I asked him about an interview I saw in which he and Reiner talked about which numbers are funny.
“We once had a sketch on ‘Show of Shows’ where Imogene Coca was playing roulette,” he recalled. “She’s going to win but we have to figure out the number. We asked her to read some different numbers, like 16 and 28. When she read 32, we all broke into great laughter. The last sound has to zoom up. Eight doesn’t zoom up. But two does zoom. I was very disappointed because my birthday is June 28.”
Brooks said that Tolkin was a “flat-out intellectual” and got him into Gogol. But Tolkin relished jokes like: “She would not have anything to do with him because he was beneath her. He got off at 116th Street, and she got off at 125th Street.”
When Brooks was working on “Your Show of Shows” and married to his first wife, a former Broadway dancer named Florence Baum, with three small children, he had anxiety attacks so severe that he was throwing up between parked cars.
Tolkin told Brooks about “the talking cure,” and sent him to a psychiatrist, who offered some career advice.
“I told the guy that I felt I couldn’t go in every day,” he said about the writers’ room. “I felt I’d have to quit. It was too much, that they’d say, ‘OK, the little dude from Brooklyn, fire him.’ He said: ‘No, you’re Mel Brooks and you’re probably the best writer on the show. I want you to go in there and not worry about being fired and ask for a raise. Say, “If I don’t get a raise, I’m quitting.”’”
I wanted to know what the titanic, mercurial Sid Caesar was like. I said that Caesar looked remarkably buff playing a cave man in “History of the World, Part I,” even though he was in his late 50s.
“Sid was an animal,” Brooks said. “He had instinctual feelings about comedy, and they were always correct. He was the strongest man on Earth. He was a big, tall, giant of a guy with muscles.”
In his 2021 memoir, “All About Me!” Brooks describes how Caesar grabbed his collar and belt and hung him out the window of a Chicago hotel room after the writer complained about Caesar’s cigar smoke.
“Got enough air?” Caesar asked his dangling writer.
Brooks told me about another terrifying night in Chicago when Caesar’s car grazed a taxi and the taxi driver yelled a vulgarity at the TV star. Brooks shivered, knowing what was coming.
“Sid got out of his car, went over to the cabdriver, who wore a yellow cap and black leather bow tie, and yelled: ‘Do you remember your birth? Do you remember being born? Think back. You’re going to enter the world, what are your thoughts?’ Then Mr. Caesar reached in, grabbed the driver by the bow tie and started pulling his head through the little clipper window and said, ‘We’re going to reenact it.’ I had to bite Sid’s hand to let him go. He would have made a snake out of that guy.”
When Brooks switched to the big screen, he thought his movie career was over before it got off the ground.
In 1968, Renata Adler reviewed “The Producers” for The New York Times and called it “a violently mixed bag. Some of it is shoddy and gross and cruel; the rest is funny in an entirely unexpected way.” She said she was torn between leaving and laughing.
“I said, ‘The New York Times didn’t like it, so maybe I should go back to television where they liked everything I did,’” Brooks recalled. By then, he had gotten divorced and remarried to Bancroft. He remembers her telling him, “No, you were born to make movies, and you just keep making them.”
Now, “The Producers,” “Blazing Saddles” and “Young Frankenstein” are all on the Library of Congress’ National Film Registry of cherished American films. Brooks not only has an EGOT but President Barack Obama awarded him the National Medal of Arts in 2016. At the ceremony, Brooks pretended to pants the president as the crowd howled.
When Brooks became a successful writer and director of movies, he was working at Universal and he saw Cary Grant step out of a Rolls-Royce. “Who wears a double-breasted chalk stripe suit in the ’80s?” he said. “It’s ridiculous.”
Grant began asking Brooks to lunch at the commissary. They ordered boiled eggs (Grant) and a tuna fish sandwich (Brooks), traded favorite colors (yellow for Grant and blue for Brooks) and favorite shoes (“I said, ‘I like black and white shoes,’ and he said, ‘Never’”). Brooks turned the odd-couple bromance into a renowned comedy bit, saying that by the end of the week, they had run out of things to talk about, so Brooks stopped taking Grant’s calls.
But in real life, Brooks said, “I certainly was hanging on every word” when Grant told stories about his beginnings as Archie Leach in England.
Was he the best-looking man Brooks ever saw in Hollywood?
“I was in an elevator at the William Morris office once,” he replied, “and Tyrone Power” — the darkly handsome actor who was a swashbuckling romantic lead in the ’30s and ’40s — “got in, and I said to him, ‘Oh, it’s going to be hard for me to say who’s better looking, you or Cary Grant.’”
Life With Anne Bancroft
Certainly, Brooks and Bancroft are one of Hollywood’s greatest love stories. People considered them an odd couple, the short comic with the funny mug and Brooklyn accent, and the gorgeous actress who created the indelible portrait of the pantherlike seductress and pre-cougar, Mrs. Robinson, in “The Graduate,” even though she was only 35 to Dustin Hoffman’s 30.
But they fell in love nearly instantly after meeting on the set of “The Perry Como Show.” Brooks compares his wooing style to Pepper Martin, a St. Louis Cardinals player in the ’30s who was famous for stealing bases. She was also impressed with his taxi whistle, he said.
They soon learned that they loved all the same things, from baseball to foreign movies to Chinese food. And if Anne loved something Mel didn’t know about, like opera, he decided to love it, too. “Anne was Catholic, a good Catholic,” Brooks said. “I lived with her for so long, I started crossing myself.” There was none of the A-lister married to A-lister angst that Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward experienced.
He was broke, so it was tough to court the more famous actress, who had already been in a spate of movies and had won two Tonys for “Two for the Seesaw” and “The Miracle Worker.”
“We’d go to a restaurant and she would slip me a couple of $20 bills under the table so it looked like I was paying for the meal,” he said. Once, when he told the waiter to keep the change, he said: “We got outside, she hit me with her purse as hard as she could. She said: ‘Are you crazy? As long as I’m paying for it, be careful with the tipping.’”
Even after they had been married for about 35 years, the thrill was still there. As she put it to The New York Daily News: “I get excited when I hear his key in the door. It’s like, ‘Ooh! The party’s going to start!’”
After she died in 2005 from uterine cancer, Brooks never dated again.
“Once you are married to Anne Bancroft, others don’t seem to be appealing,” he said. “It’s as simple as that.”
After they became widowers, Brooks and Reiner often had dinner together on tray tables and watched TV at the Reiner hacienda on Rodeo Drive. In his memoir, Brooks called Reiner, who died in 2020, not only the best friend he ever had but “the best friend anyone ever had.”
They talked and napped and watched “Wheel of Fortune” and then “Jeopardy!,” arguing over the answers. Sometimes, they watched old movies. “Once a week, I had to watch ‘Random Harvest’ with Ronald Colman,” Brooks recalled dryly. “Carl always said, ‘If you don’t cry watching the end, you’re not alive.’”
Proudly, Brooks noted that their chairs and tray tables are now on display in the National Comedy Center in Jamestown, New York.
He is happy, as we end our 90-minute interview, because we have laughed a lot, and laughter, he said, is the most important thing to him.
“Money is honey, funny is money,” he said blithely, echoing a Max Bialystock line from “The Producers.” “I really care about saying things that make people roar with laughter. I was on the stage at Radio City Music Hall, and we took questions in the last part of my standup. One of the questions was, ‘What do you wear — long shorts or briefs?’ I yelled, ‘Depends!’ It’s a thrill to get a big laugh.”
CONFIRM OR DENY
Maureen Dowd: You love schwanzstucker jokes .
Mel Brooks: Actually, Gene Wilder came up with that word while we were writing “Young Frankenstein” together.
Dowd: You still like to do your wolf howl from “Young Frankenstein.”
Brooks: You’re all wet. It’s not a wolf howl. It’s a cat yowl. I’ll do it for you. [He does a cat yowl, based on the big alley cats he knew in Brooklyn.] Nobody does a better cat yowl than me. I could do that for a living.
Dowd: You like to set the mood when you’re writing.
Brooks: When we were writing “Blazing Saddles,” I actually wore a war bonnet. Just to stay with it, and get everybody crazy.
Dowd: You preserved your hearing during the war by shoving cigarettes in your ears, but you ended up with yellow ears.
Brooks: True story. When I did my first movie, “The Producers,” the insurance nurse looked me over and said, “Did you have yellow fever?”
Dowd: Richard Pryor, who worked on the script of “Blazing Saddles” with you, was the greatest standup comedian who ever lived.
Brooks: He was. One time on a Friday night, he said, “Mel, go over to the Bitter End and sub for me, do my act. I have to be in Chicago. I found out later he had a girlfriend in Chicago. I said, “All right, what do you want me to do?” He said, “Be funny. Do my act.” I went to the Bitter End and I said, “Richard couldn’t make it but I’m doing his act for you. I was born in Kansas City to a big Black woman who ran a cat house and she took care of me and she taught me how to play the piano. I used to pee out the windows.” I was doing his act. Afterward, he said, “Are you crazy?”
Dowd: You almost cast Dustin Hoffman as the Nazi playwright in “The Producers.”
Brooks: I did cast him. He put that helmet on with the pigeon doody and he looked exactly like a good Nazi. Anyway, he couldn’t do it because he got another job.
Dowd: You have some final words from the 2,000 Year Old Man.
Brooks: As the 2,000 Year Old Man, I would say be nice to everyone around you because you never know where they’re going to end up. Even if you don’t like them, don’t let them know because they’re liable to one day run a studio. They’re liable to be Harry Cohn.
Dowd: Your Hollywood star has one six-fingered hand.
Brooks: It’s true. I did it with a plaster mold just so that somebody from Idaho would scream, “Henry, come over here! Look at this. Mel Brooks has six fingers.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Mel Brooks is a sophisticated guy. He collected fancy French wines and did a tasting on Johnny Carson’s show. He drops references to Nikolai Gogol’s “Dead Souls.” He was married for 40 years to that epitome of elegance, Anne Bancroft. He was a favorite lunch companion of Cary Grant, the suavest man who ever lived.
But in the new Hulu show “History of the World, Part II,” you can still find all the Mel Brooks signature comedy stylings: penis jokes, puke jokes and fart jokes.
“I like fart jokes,” he said, Zooming from his home in Santa Monica, California. “It adds some je ne sais quoi to the comedy. A touch of sophistication for the smarter people helps move the show along.”
After all, with the percussive campfire scene in his 1974 comedy classic, “Blazing Saddles,” where the cowhands sit around eating beans and passing wind, he elevated flatulence to cinematic history.
The comedy legend, 96, preferred to meet on Zoom because he’s wary of COVID. Strangers love to hug him and say, “Mel, I love you!” he said, adding, “I’m a target.”
The man behind outlandish, hilarious movies like “The Producers,” “Young Frankenstein,” “Spaceballs,” “High Anxiety,” “Robin Hood: Men in Tights” and “History of the World, Part I,” along with the hit TV spy comedy “Get Smart,” no longer lives in a time when he can have “absolutely no restrictions on any and all subjects,” as he said about writing “Blazing Saddles” (which was slapped with its own content warning in 2020 when it was on HBO Max). And he lost the two loves of his life, Bancroft and Carl Reiner. But Mel Brooks is still a ball of fire.
Having lived through nearly a century of history, Brooks is sneaking up on his famous character, the 2,000 Year Old Man. But his taste in comedy is still as merrily immature as ever. He has sharp takes on world history, greed and hypocrisy. He knows who the villains are and what the stakes are, and yet he’s not afraid of the lowbrow.
Max Brooks, his son with Bancroft, said his father’s mantra is: “If you’re going to climb the tower, ring the bell.”
“He believes if you’re going to make a piece of art, don’t be safe, don’t be careful, don’t pander to a certain group to win their favor.”
Mel Brooks is still making fun of Hitler. The new show has a sketch called “Hitler on Ice,” with three TV commentators savaging an ice-skating Führer who falls. One sniffs, “I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: If you put concentration camps in people’s countries, you better be flawless on the ice.”
Using Comedy as a Weapon
Brooks’ parents were immigrants, his mother from Ukraine and his father from Germany. His father died of tuberculosis when Brooks was 2; there was no money to send him to a sanitarium, Max Brooks said. When the little boy, born Melvin Kaminsky, needed fillings for his teeth that would have cost a dollar apiece, his mother could not afford it, so she had to let the dentist rip them out for half price.
He fought in the U.S. Army against the Nazis and dealt with antisemitism among some of his fellow soldiers. He said he felt like Errol Flynn when he got instruction on cavalry charges with horses and sabers. He was a corporal, a combat engineer who defused land mines and cleared booby-trapped buildings. (He was in the German town of Baumholder on V-E Day.) His three brothers also fought in the war and one, Lenny, a pilot, ended up a prisoner in a Nazi POW camp for 19 months, where he had to pretend he wasn’t Jewish.
“I was on a troop ship, and I paid a sailor on deck $50 to let me sleep under a lifeboat in case we were torpedoed,” Brooks recalled. “The smells were dreadful, 500 guys on a ship. It was 16 or 17 days from the Navy yard in Brooklyn to Le Havre, France, zigzagging and trying not to get torpedoed.”
And ever since the war, he said, “I’ve tried to get even with Hitler by taking the Mickey out of him, making fun, but it’s difficult.”
Brooks, who was sometimes bullied as a child, learned to use comedy as a weapon. When his musical version of “The Producers” in 2001 — with a swanning, singing and dancing Hitler — held a preview in Chicago, “some big guy kept storming up the aisle and saying: ‘How dare you have Hitler” How dare you have the swastika? I was in World War II risking my life, and you do this on a stage?’ I said, ‘I was in World War II, and I didn’t see you there.’”
“History of the World, Part I,” the 1981 movie on which the Hulu series is riffing, was a raunchy romp through different eras, from the Stone Age to the French Revolution. It featured the peerless Madeline Kahn as Empress Nympho, Nero’s wife; Sid Caesar as the cave man who invented music and the spear but could not quite figure out fire; and Brooks in multiple roles. He played Comicus, the stand-up philosopher; a singing Torquemada with a bevy of synchronized swimmers; and a libidinous Louis XVI, having his way with women and crowing, “It’s good to be the king.”
It was chockablock with puns, including the classic in which Harvey Korman, as the Count de Monet, chastised his impudent companion, “Don’t be saucy with me, Béarnaise.”
Brooks tacked on “Part I” to the title as a joke, he said, but then “I was plagued with about a billion calls, ‘Where’s Part II?’ I never intended to do Part II.”
But he and his producing partner, Kevin Salter, eventually gave in to popular demand. Brooks said he thought: “What the hell? Let’s try Part II.” They reached out to comedian Nick Kroll in 2020. He recruited Wanda Sykes, Ike Barinholtz and showrunner David Stassen. “I’ve been laughing at comedy, some of which I didn’t create,” Brooks said, “which is very weird for me.” The writers did remind themselves, as Sykes said, to “Mel it up.”
Once the ball got rolling, all the comedians who idolized Brooks wanted in — from Johnny Knoxville (who plays Rasputin getting his attenuated member cut off) to Sarah Silverman (who is in a “Jews in space” skit previewed in Part I with the song “Jews, out in space, we’re zooming along, protecting the Hebrew race”) to Jack Black (a sneaky Stalin).
Knoxville said that Brooks is “the legend of legends,” who pushes things as far as possible (which is also the “Jackass” way). He got to talk to his idol on the phone one night. “I was shaking before and during and after,” Knoxville said. “I don’t know if he got a word in edgewise.”
Knoxville thinks he saw Rasputin’s “Jim Dog,” as he called the body part, pronouncing it “Dawg,” in a jar in St. Petersburg, Russia, at the Museum of Erotica. It’s not clear if the castration of the concupiscent mystic was mere legend, but in the “History of the World” universe, Brooks is happy to go with the legend.
“Before Mel, I don’t think movies were hilarious,” Barinholtz said. “Before ‘Blazing Saddles,’ regular people were not going to the movie theater and laughing so hard they were hyperventilating. Mel, I think, really ushered that in.” He and some of the other comedians who worked on the show had not met Brooks before, Barinholtz said, adding, “He inspected our teeth and could tell that we were strong.”
Galileo on Social Media
Brooks, who narrated the final product with a muscly CGI body, helped the comedians decide which slices of history to explore in the sequel, and joined the Zoom writers’ room sometimes to weigh pitches or offer jokes from his vault of unused material.
“The first time we talked, he was like, ‘I have an idea for this joke where Robert E. Lee is at Appomattox and he turns to sign and his sword knocks his guys in the balls,’” Kroll said. “Then when we decided to do a whole section on Ulysses S. Grant and the signing at Appomattox, we were like: ‘Perfect. We can do that joke.’”
And like Part I, in which Comicus pulls up in a chariot to Caesar’s palace during the Roman Empire but it turns out to be the Las Vegas Caesars Palace, Part II has plenty of fun anachronisms, like Galileo on “TicciTocci” or Harriet Tubman’s Underground Railroad morphing into the New York subway.
Barinholtz said Brooks’ instruction was: “Don’t get too esoteric. Play the hits.” He said they didn’t use the racial and sexual epithets that peppered Brooks’ movies in the 1960s, ’70s and ’80s but stuck to the same themes.
In one episode, a Native American Civil War soldier played by Zahn McClarnon has to do a stand-up routine to distract a bunch of West Virginia racists trying to hang Grant, played by Barinholtz. Noting that the colonizers had built Ohio on top of his razed family home, the soldier advised, “If you’re going to genocide a people, you should get something better out of it than Cleveland.”
Brooks, too, said he would no longer use the inflammatory words he used so freely back in the day. I asked him about his fellow comics — like Chris Rock, Bill Maher and Jerry Seinfeld — who worry that wokeness is neutering comedy.
He looked over at Salter. “I had a talk with Kevin before this,” he told me. “He said: ‘If Maureen, for some reason, brings up woke and woke comedy, stay off it. Stay away.’”
He endorsed Joe Biden in 2020, but he said he doesn’t like to do political comedy because then “half the audience is going to be angry at me.” He prefers jokes like this one from the new show about the Virgin Mary: “She thinks her son is God. The mother’s definitely Jewish.”
Is he surprised antisemitism is on the rise?
“Why would you want to be anti-Jewish after those stories about concentration camps?” he said. “How could you be?”
I asked Larry David, who did a whole season of “Curb Your Enthusiasm” revolving around “The Producers” — with cameos by Brooks and Bancroft — why Brooks sits atop the comedy pantheon.
“It’s almost as if he was designed in Silicon Valley,” David said. “What would the funniest man in the world look and sound like? And they came up with Mel.”
The Greatest Writers’ Rooms in History
My first memory of laughing until I cried was watching Sid Caesar cavort on “Caesar’s Hour,” the sequel to “Your Show of Shows.” Brooks wrote for both, as part of the most famous writers’ rooms in TV history. Brooks worked in those rooms with Mel Tolkin, the head writer; Carl Reiner; Neil Simon; Larry Gelbart (“the fastest mouth and brain in the West,” as Brooks called him, who went on to do “M*A*S*H” and “Tootsie”); Lucille Kallen, one of the first women writing for television, who did the domestic sketches for “Your Show of Shows”; Aaron Ruben (who later produced “The Andy Griffith Show”); and a very young Woody Allen.
Was he jealous of the prelapsarian Allen?
“I was, but this is the first time I’ve ever mentioned it,” he said, with a mock grimace. “I said: ‘That little mouse. That little rat. How did he come up with that?’ Woody would come up with a lot of stuff. He was sly, and he was a brilliant writer.”
He said that Simon, known as Doc Simon, “had a very pale, light, little voice, which sometimes drove us crazy. Carl Reiner would sit next to him, and Doc would whisper his jokes into Carl’s left ear, and Carl would stand up and say, ‘Doc has it.’ And it would be wonderful.”
I asked him about an interview I saw in which he and Reiner talked about which numbers are funny.
“We once had a sketch on ‘Show of Shows’ where Imogene Coca was playing roulette,” he recalled. “She’s going to win but we have to figure out the number. We asked her to read some different numbers, like 16 and 28. When she read 32, we all broke into great laughter. The last sound has to zoom up. Eight doesn’t zoom up. But two does zoom. I was very disappointed because my birthday is June 28.”
Brooks said that Tolkin was a “flat-out intellectual” and got him into Gogol. But Tolkin relished jokes like: “She would not have anything to do with him because he was beneath her. He got off at 116th Street, and she got off at 125th Street.”
When Brooks was working on “Your Show of Shows” and married to his first wife, a former Broadway dancer named Florence Baum, with three small children, he had anxiety attacks so severe that he was throwing up between parked cars.
Tolkin told Brooks about “the talking cure,” and sent him to a psychiatrist, who offered some career advice.
“I told the guy that I felt I couldn’t go in every day,” he said about the writers’ room. “I felt I’d have to quit. It was too much, that they’d say, ‘OK, the little dude from Brooklyn, fire him.’ He said: ‘No, you’re Mel Brooks and you’re probably the best writer on the show. I want you to go in there and not worry about being fired and ask for a raise. Say, “If I don’t get a raise, I’m quitting.”’”
I wanted to know what the titanic, mercurial Sid Caesar was like. I said that Caesar looked remarkably buff playing a cave man in “History of the World, Part I,” even though he was in his late 50s.
“Sid was an animal,” Brooks said. “He had instinctual feelings about comedy, and they were always correct. He was the strongest man on Earth. He was a big, tall, giant of a guy with muscles.”
In his 2021 memoir, “All About Me!” Brooks describes how Caesar grabbed his collar and belt and hung him out the window of a Chicago hotel room after the writer complained about Caesar’s cigar smoke.
“Got enough air?” Caesar asked his dangling writer.
Brooks told me about another terrifying night in Chicago when Caesar’s car grazed a taxi and the taxi driver yelled a vulgarity at the TV star. Brooks shivered, knowing what was coming.
“Sid got out of his car, went over to the cabdriver, who wore a yellow cap and black leather bow tie, and yelled: ‘Do you remember your birth? Do you remember being born? Think back. You’re going to enter the world, what are your thoughts?’ Then Mr. Caesar reached in, grabbed the driver by the bow tie and started pulling his head through the little clipper window and said, ‘We’re going to reenact it.’ I had to bite Sid’s hand to let him go. He would have made a snake out of that guy.”
Brooks not only has an EGOT, but Barack Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016. At the ceremony, the comedian pretended to pants the president as the crowd howled.
But when Brooks switched to the big screen, he thought his movie career was over before it got off the ground.
In 1968, Renata Adler reviewed “The Producers” for The New York Times and called it “a violently mixed bag. Some of it is shoddy and gross and cruel; the rest is funny in an entirely unexpected way.” She said she was torn between leaving and laughing.
“I said, ‘The New York Times didn’t like it, so maybe I should go back to television where they liked everything I did,’” Brooks recalled. By then, he had gotten divorced and remarried to Bancroft. He remembers her telling him, “No, you were born to make movies, and you just keep making them.”
Now, “The Producers,” “Blazing Saddles” and “Young Frankenstein” are all on the Library of Congress’ National Film Registry of cherished American films.
When Brooks became a successful writer and director of movies, he was working at Universal and he saw Cary Grant step out of a Rolls-Royce. “Who wears a double-breasted chalk stripe suit in the ’80s?” he said. “It’s ridiculous.”
Grant began asking Brooks to lunch at the commissary. They ordered boiled eggs (Grant) and a tuna fish sandwich (Brooks), traded favorite colors (yellow for Grant and blue for Brooks) and favorite shoes (“I said, ‘I like black and white shoes,’ and he said, ‘Never’”). Brooks turned the odd-couple bromance into a renowned comedy bit, saying that by the end of the week, they had run out of things to talk about, so Brooks stopped taking Grant’s calls.
But in real life, Brooks said, “I certainly was hanging on every word” when Grant told stories about his beginnings as Archie Leach in England.
Was he the best-looking man Brooks ever saw in Hollywood?
“I was in an elevator at the William Morris office once,” he replied, “and Tyrone Power” — the darkly handsome actor who was a swashbuckling romantic lead in the ’30s and ’40s — “got in, and I said to him, ‘Oh, it’s going to be hard for me to say who’s better looking, you or Cary Grant.’”
Life With Anne Bancroft
Certainly, Brooks and Bancroft are one of Hollywood’s greatest love stories. People considered them an odd couple, the short comic with the funny mug and Brooklyn accent, and the gorgeous actress who created the indelible portrait of the pantherlike seductress and pre-cougar, Mrs. Robinson, in “The Graduate,” even though she was only 35.
But they fell in love nearly instantly after meeting on the set of “The Perry Como Show.” Brooks compares his wooing style to Pepper Martin, a St. Louis Cardinals player in the ’30s who was famous for stealing bases. She was also impressed with his taxi whistle, he said.
They soon learned that they loved all the same things, from baseball to foreign movies to Chinese food. And if Anne loved something Mel didn’t know about, like opera, he decided to love it, too. “Anne was Catholic, a good Catholic,” Brooks said. “I lived with her for so long, I started crossing myself.”
He was broke, so it was tough to court the more famous actress, who had already been in a spate of movies and had won Tonys for “Two for the Seesaw” and “The Miracle Worker.”
“We’d go to a restaurant and she would slip me a couple of $20 bills under the table so it looked like I was paying for the meal,” he said. Once, when he told the waiter to keep the change, he said: “We got outside, she hit me with her purse as hard as she could. She said: ‘Are you crazy? As long as I’m paying for it, be careful with the tipping.’”
Even after they had been married for about 35 years, the thrill was still there. As she put it to The New York Daily News: “I get excited when I hear his key in the door. It’s like, ‘Ooh! The party’s going to start!’”
After she died in 2005 from uterine cancer, Brooks never dated again.
“Once you are married to Anne Bancroft, others don’t seem to be appealing,” he said. “It’s as simple as that.”
After they became widowers, Brooks and Reiner often had dinner together on tray tables and watched TV at the Reiner hacienda on Rodeo Drive. In his memoir, Brooks called Reiner, who died in 2020, not only the best friend he ever had but “the best friend anyone ever had.”
They talked and napped and watched “Wheel of Fortune” and then “Jeopardy!,” arguing over the answers. Sometimes, they watched old movies. “Once a week, I had to watch ‘Random Harvest’ with Ronald Colman,” Brooks recalled dryly. “Carl always said, ‘If you don’t cry watching the end, you’re not alive.’”
He is happy, as we end our 90-minute interview, because we have laughed a lot, and laughter, he said, is the most important thing to him.
“Money is honey, funny is money,” he said blithely, echoing a Max Bialystock line from “The Producers.” “I really care about saying things that make people roar with laughter. I was on the stage at Radio City Music Hall, and we took questions in the last part of my standup. One of the questions was, ‘What do you wear — long shorts or briefs?’ I yelled, ‘Depends!’ It’s a thrill to get a big laugh.”
CONFIRM OR DENY
Maureen Dowd: Your narration of “History of the World, Part II,” was better than Orson Welles’s narration of “History of the World, Part I.”
Mel Brooks: No, you couldn’t be better. Orson Welles came to the studio. He said, “I want $25,000 in a paper bag and please don’t mention it to my agent.” I said, “What are you going to do with that $25,000 in the paper bag?” He said, “Beluga caviar and the finest Cuban cigars.”
Dowd: You love schwanzstucker jokes .
Brooks: Actually, Gene Wilder came up with that word while we were writing “Young Frankenstein” together.
Dowd: You still like to do your wolf howl from “Young Frankenstein.”
Brooks: You’re all wet. It’s not a wolf howl. It’s a cat yowl. I’ll do it for you. [He does a cat yowl, based on the big alley cats he knew in Brooklyn.] Nobody does a better cat yowl than me. I could do that for a living.
Dowd: You like to set the mood when you’re writing.
Brooks: When we were writing “Blazing Saddles,” I actually wore a war bonnet. Just to stay with it, and get everybody crazy.
Dowd: You preserved your hearing during the war by shoving cigarettes in your ears, but you ended up with yellow ears.
Brooks: True story. When I did my first movie, “The Producers,” the insurance nurse looked me over and said, “Did you have yellow fever?”
Dowd: Richard Pryor, who worked on the script of “Blazing Saddles” with you, was the greatest standup comedian who ever lived.
Brooks: He was. One time on a Friday night, he said, “Mel, go over to the Bitter End and sub for me, do my act. I have to be in Chicago. I found out later he had a girlfriend in Chicago. I said, “All right, what do you want me to do?” He said, “Be funny. Do my act.” I went to the Bitter End and I said, “Richard couldn’t make it but I’m doing his act for you. I was born in Kansas City to a big Black woman who ran a cat house and she took care of me and she taught me how to play the piano. I used to pee out the windows.” I was doing his act. Afterward, he said, “Are you crazy?”
Dowd: You almost cast Dustin Hoffman as the Nazi playwright in “The Producers.”
Brooks: I did cast him. He put that helmet on with the pigeon doody and he looked exactly like a good Nazi. Anyway, he couldn’t do it because he got another job.
Dowd: You have some final words from the 2,000 Year Old Man.
Brooks: As the 2,000 Year Old Man, I would say be nice to everyone around you because you never know where they’re going to end up. Even if you don’t like them, don’t let them know because they’re liable to one day run a studio. They’re liable to be Harry Cohn.
Dowd: Your Hollywood star has one six-fingered hand.
Brooks: It’s true. I did it with a plaster mold just so that somebody from Idaho would scream, “Henry, come over here! Look at this. Mel Brooks has six fingers.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mel Brooks is a sophisticated guy. He collected fancy French wines and did a tasting on Johnny Carson's show. He drops references to Nikolai Gogol's "Dead Souls." He was married for 40 years to that epitome of elegance, Anne Bancroft. He was a favorite lunch companion of Cary Grant, the suavest man who ever lived.
But in the new Hulu show "History of the World, Part II," you can still find all the Mel Brooks signature comedy stylings: penis jokes, puke jokes and fart jokes.
"I like fart jokes," he said, Zooming from his home in Santa Monica, Calif. "It adds some je ne sais quoi to the comedy. A touch of sophistication for the smarter people helps move the show along."
After all, with the percussive campfire scene in his 1974 comedy classic, "Blazing Saddles," where the cowhands sit around eating beans and passing wind, he elevated flatulence to cinematic history.
The comedy legend, 96, preferred to meet on Zoom because he's wary of Covid. Strangers love to hug him and say, "Mel, I love you!" he said, adding, "I'm a target."
The man behind outlandish, hilarious movies like "The Producers," "Young Frankenstein," "Spaceballs," "High Anxiety," "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" and "History of the World, Part I," along with the hit TV spy comedy "Get Smart," no longer lives in a time where he can have "absolutely no restrictions on any and all subjects," as he said about writing "Blazing Saddles" (which was slapped with its own content warning in 2020 when it was on HBO Max). And he lost the two loves of his life, Ms. Bancroft and Carl Reiner. But Mel Brooks is still a ball of fire.
Having lived through nearly a century of history, Mr. Brooks is sneaking up on his famous character, the 2,000 Year Old Man. But his taste in comedy is still as merrily immature as ever. He has sharp takes on world history, greed and hypocrisy. He knows who the villains are and what the stakes are, and yet he's not afraid of the lowbrow.
Max Brooks, his son with Ms. Bancroft, said his father's mantra is: "If you're going to climb the tower, ring the bell."
"He believes if you're going to make a piece of art, don't be safe, don't be careful, don't pander to a certain group to win their favor."
Mel Brooks is still making fun of Hitler. The new show has a sketch called "Hitler on Ice," with three TV commentators savaging an ice-skating Führer who falls. One sniffs, "I've said it before and I'll say it again: If you put concentration camps in people's countries, you better be flawless on the ice."
Using Comedy as a Weapon Mr. Brooks's parents were immigrants, his mother from Ukraine and his father from Germany. His father died of tuberculosis when Mr. Brooks was 2; there was no money to send him to a sanitarium, Max Brooks said. When the little boy, born Melvin Kaminsky, needed fillings for his teeth that would have cost a dollar apiece, his mother could not afford it, so she had to let the dentist rip them out for half price.
He fought in the U.S. Army against the Nazis, and dealt with antisemitism among some of his fellow soldiers. He said he felt like Errol Flynn when he got instruction on cavalry charges with horses and sabers. He was a corporal, a combat engineer who defused land mines and cleared booby-trapped buildings in France and Germany. (He was in the German town of Baumholder on V.E. Day.) His three other brothers also fought in the war and one, Lenny, an Air Force pilot, ended up a prisoner in a Nazi P.O.W. camp for 19 months, where he had to pretend he wasn't Jewish.
"I was on a troop ship, and I paid a sailor on deck $ 50 to let me sleep under a lifeboat in case we were torpedoed," Mr. Brooks recalled. "The smells were dreadful, 500 guys on a ship. It was 16 or 17 days from the Navy yard in Brooklyn to Le Havre, France, zigzagging and trying not to get torpedoed."
And ever since the war, he said, "I've tried to get even with Hitler by taking the Mickey out of him, making fun, but it's difficult."
Mr. Brooks, who was sometimes bullied as a child, learned to use comedy as a weapon. When his musical version of "The Producers" in 2001 -- with a swanning, singing and dancing Hitler -- held a preview in Chicago, "some big guy kept storming up the aisle and saying, 'How dare you have Hitler, how dare you have the swastika? I was in World War II risking my life and you do this on a stage?' I said, 'I was in World War II and I didn't see you there."'
"History of the World, Part I," the 1981 movie on which the Hulu series is riffing, was a raunchy romp through different eras, from the Stone Age to the French Revolution. It featured the peerless Madeline Kahn as Empress Nympho, Nero's wife; Sid Caesar as the cave man who invented music and the spear but could not quite figure out fire; and Mr. Brooks in multiple roles. He played Comicus, the stand-up philosopher; a singing Torquemada with a bevy of synchronized swimmers; and a libidinous Louis XVI, having his way with women and crowing, "It's good to be the king."
It was chockablock with puns, including the classic in which Harvey Korman, as the Count de Monet, chastised his impudent companion, "Don't be saucy with me, Béarnaise."
Mr. Brooks tacked on "Part I" to the title as a joke, he said, but then "I was plagued with about a billion calls, 'Where's Part II?' I never intended to do Part II."
But he and his producing partner, Kevin Salter, eventually gave in to popular demand. Mr. Brooks said he thought, "What the hell? Let's try Part II." They reached out to comedian Nick Kroll in 2020. He recruited Wanda Sykes, Ike Barinholtz and the showrunner David Stassen. "I've been laughing at comedy, some of which I didn't create," Mr. Brooks said, "which is very weird for me." The writers did remind themselves, though, as Ms. Sykes said, to "Mel it up."
Once the ball got rolling, all the comedians who idolized Mr. Brooks wanted in -- from Johnny Knoxville (who plays Rasputin getting his attenuated member cut off) to Sarah Silverman (who is in a "Jews in space" skit previewed in Part I with the song "Jews, out in space, we're zooming along, protecting the Hebrew race") to Jack Black (a sneaky Stalin).
Mr. Knoxville said that Mr. Brooks is "the legend of legends," who pushes things as far as possible (which is also the "Jackass" way). He got to talk to his idol on the phone one night. "I was shaking before and during and after," Mr. Knoxville said. "I don't know if he got a word in edgewise."
Mr. Knoxville thinks that he actually saw Rasputin's "Jim Dog," as he called the body part, pronouncing it "Dawg," in a jar in St. Petersburg, Russia, at the Museum of Erotica. It's not clear if the castration of the concupiscent mystic was mere legend, but in the "History of the World" universe, Mr. Brooks is happy to go with the legend.
"Before Mel, I don't think movies were hilarious," Mr. Barinholtz said. "Before 'Blazing Saddles,' regular people were not going to the movie theater and laughing so hard they were hyperventilating. Mel, I think, really ushered that in." He and some of the other comedians who worked on the show had not met Mr. Brooks before, Mr. Barinholtz said, adding: "He inspected our teeth and could tell that we were strong."
Mr. Brooks himself narrates the film, with a muscly CGI body. I asked how he compared to the original narrator, Orson Welles. Mr. Brooks gave the contest to Mr. Welles: "He said, 'I want $ 25,000 in a paper bag and please don't mention it to my agent.' I said, 'What are you going to do with that $ 25,000 in the paper bag?' He said, 'Beluga caviar and the finest Cuban cigars."'
Galileo on Social Media
Mr. Brooks helped the comedians decide which slices of history to explore in the sequel, and joined the Zoom writers' room sometimes to weigh pitches or offer jokes from his vault of unused material.
"The first time we talked, he was like, 'I have an idea for this joke where Robert E. Lee is at Appomattox and he turns to sign and his sword knocks his guys in the balls,"' Mr. Kroll said. "Then when we decided to do a whole section on Ulysses S. Grant and the signing at Appomattox, we were like, 'Perfect. We can do that joke."'
And like Part I, in which Comicus pulls up in a chariot to Caesar's palace during the Roman Empire but it turns out to be the Vegas Caesar's Palace, Part II has plenty of fun anachronisms, like Galileo on "TicciTocci" or Harriet Tubman's Underground Railroad morphing into the New York subway.
Mr. Barinholtz said Mr. Brooks's instruction was: "Don't get too esoteric. Play the hits." He said they didn't use the racial and sexual epithets that peppered Mr. Brooks's movies in the 1960s, '70s and '80s, but they stuck to the same themes.
In one episode, a Native American Civil War soldier played by Zahn McClarnon has to do a standup routine to distract a bunch of West Virginia racists who are trying to hang General Grant, played by Mr. Barinholtz. Noting that the colonizers had built Ohio on top of his razed family home, the soldier advised: "If you're going to genocide a people, you should get something better out of it than Cleveland."
Mr. Brooks, too, said he would no longer use the inflammatory words he used so freely back in the day. I asked him about his fellow comics, like Chris Rock, Bill Maher and Jerry Seinfeld, who worry that wokeness is neutering comedy.
He looked over at Mr. Salter, who was sitting beside him. "I had a talk with Kevin before this," he told me. "He said, 'If Maureen, for some reason, brings up woke and woke comedy, stay off it. Stay away."'
Laughing, I conceded, "I'm so obvious."
"Yes," he replied. "Absolutely."
(When I pressed about the commotions around Dave Chappelle and Ricky Gervais, who were accused of being insensitive to transgender people, Mr. Brooks again glided away.)
He endorsed Joe Biden in 2020 but he said he doesn't like to do political comedy because then, "half the audience is going to be angry at me." He prefers jokes like this one from the new show about the Virgin Mary: "She thinks her son is God. The mother's definitely Jewish."
Why are so many of the most storied comedians Jewish?
"Well, I don't think they let them into railroads," he said, laughing. "If you were a Jew, you couldn't own a railroad."
Is he surprised antisemitism is on the rise?
"Why would you want to be anti-Jewish after those stories about concentration camps?" he said. "How could you be?"
I asked Larry David, who did a whole season of "Curb Your Enthusiasm" revolving around "The Producers" -- with cameos by Mr. Brooks and Ms. Bancroft -- why Mr. Brooks sits atop the comedy pantheon.
"It's almost as if he was designed in Silicon Valley," Mr. David said. "What would the funniest man in the world look and sound like? And they came up with Mel."
The Greatest Writers' Rooms in History
My first memory of laughing until I cried was sitting on Saturday nights watching Sid Caesar cavort on "Caesar's Hour," the sequel to "Your Show of Shows." Mr. Brooks wrote for both, as part of the most famous writers' rooms in TV history.
(The new "History of the World" depicts Shakespeare's writers' room, with Francis Bacon toiling away. Someone pitches "Othello," an interracial love story about a white woman and a Black man that's not about race, and Shakespeare replies: "I am an ally but I don't think it's my story to tell.")
Mr. Brooks worked in those rooms with Mel Tolkin, the head writer; Carl Reiner; Neil Simon; Larry Gelbart ("the fastest mouth and brain in the West," as Mr. Brooks called him, who went on to do "MASH and "Tootsie"); Lucille Kallen, one of the first women writing for television, who did the domestic sketches for "Your Show of Shows"; Aaron Ruben (who later produced "The Andy Griffith Show"); and a very young Woody Allen.
Was he jealous of the prelapsarian Allen?
"I was, but this is the first time I've ever mentioned it," he said, with a mock grimace. "I said, 'That little mouse. That little rat. How did he come up with that?' Woody would come up with a lot of stuff. He was sly and he was a brilliant writer."
He said that Mr. Simon, known as Doc Simon, "had a very pale, light, little voice, which sometimes drove us crazy. Carl Reiner would sit next to him and Doc would whisper his jokes into Carl's left ear, and Carl would stand up and say, 'Doc has it!' And it would be wonderful."
I asked him about an interview I saw in which he and Mr. Reiner talked about which numbers are funny.
"We once had a sketch on 'Show of Shows' where Imogene Coca was playing roulette," he recalled. "She's going to win but we have to figure out the number. We asked her to read some different numbers, like 16 and 28. When she read 32, we all broke into great laughter. The last sound has to zoom up. Eight doesn't zoom up. But two does zoom. I was very disappointed because my birthday is June 28."
Mr. Brooks said that Mr. Tolkin was a "flat-out intellectual" and got him into Gogol. But Mr. Tolkin relished jokes like "She would not have anything to do with him because he was beneath her. He got off at 116th Street and she got off at 125th Street."
When Mr. Brooks was working on "Your Show of Shows," and married to his first wife, a former Broadway dancer named Florence Baum, with three small children, he had anxiety attacks so severe that he was throwing up between parked cars.
Mr. Tolkin told Mr. Brooks about "the talking cure," and sent him to a psychiatrist, who offered some career advice, too.
"I told the guy that I felt I couldn't go in every day," he said about the writers' room. "I felt I'd have to quit. It was too much, that they'd say, 'OK, the little dude from Brooklyn, fire him.' He said, 'No, you're Mel Brooks and you're probably the best writer on the show. I want you to go in there and not worry about being fired and ask for a raise. Say, "If I don't get a raise, I'm quitting.""'
I wanted to know what the titanic, mercurial Sid Caesar was like. I said that Mr. Caesar looked remarkably buff playing a cave man in "History of the World, Part I," even though he was in his late 50s.
"Sid was an animal," Mr. Brooks said. "He had instinctual feelings about comedy, and they were always correct. He was the strongest man on earth. He was a big, tall, giant of a guy with muscles."
In his 2021 memoir, "All About Me!," Mr. Brooks describes how Mr. Caesar grabbed his collar and belt and hung him out the window of a Chicago hotel room after the writer complained about Mr. Caesar's cigar smoke.
"Got enough air?" Mr. Caesar asked his dangling writer.
Mr. Brooks told me about another terrifying night in Chicago when Mr. Caesar's car grazed a taxi and the taxi driver yelled a vulgarity at the TV star. Mr. Brooks shivered, knowing what was coming.
"Sid got out of his car, went over to the cabdriver, who wore a yellow cap and black leather bow tie, and yelled, 'Do you remember your birth? Do you remember being born? Think back. You're going to enter the world, what are your thoughts?' Then Mr. Caesar reached in, grabbed the driver by the bow tie and started pulling his head through the little clipper window and said, 'We're going to re-enact it.' I had to bite Sid's hand to let him go. He would have made a snake out of that guy." When Mr. Brooks switched to the big screen, he thought his movie career was over before it got off the ground.
In 1968, Renata Adler reviewed "The Producers" for The New York Times and called it "a violently mixed bag. Some of it is shoddy and gross and cruel; the rest is funny in an entirely unexpected way." She said she was torn between leaving and laughing.
"I said, 'The New York Times didn't like it, so maybe I should go back to television where they liked everything I did,"' Mr. Brooks recalled. By then, he had gotten divorced and remarried to Ms. Bancroft. He remembers her telling him, "No, you were born to make movies, and you just keep making them."
Now, "The Producers," "Blazing Saddles" and "Young Frankenstein" are all on the Library of Congress's National Film Registry of cherished American films. He not only has an EGOT but Barack Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016. At the ceremony, Mr. Brooks pretended to pants the president as the crowd howled.
When Mr. Brooks became a successful writer and director of movies, he was working at Universal and he saw Cary Grant step out of a Rolls-Royce. "Who wears a double-breasted chalk stripe suit in the '80s?" he said. "It's ridiculous."
Mr. Grant began asking Mr. Brooks to lunch at the commissary. They ordered boiled eggs (Mr. Grant) and a tuna fish sandwich (Mr. Brooks), traded favorite colors (yellow for Mr. Grant and blue for Mr. Brooks) and favorite shoes ("I said, 'I like black and white shoes' and he said 'Never"'). Mr. Brooks turned the odd-couple bromance into a renowned comedy bit, saying that by the end of the week, they had run out of things to talk about, so Mr. Brooks stopped taking Mr. Grant's calls.
But in real life, Mr. Brooks said, "I certainly was hanging on every word" when Mr. Grant told stories about his beginnings as Archie Leach in England.
Was he the best-looking man Mr. Brooks ever saw in Hollywood?
"I was in an elevator at the William Morris office once," he replied, "and Tyrone Power" -- the darkly handsome actor who was a swashbuckling romantic lead in the '30s and '40s -- "got in and I said to him, 'Oh, it's going to be hard for me to say who's better looking, you or Cary Grant."'
Life With Anne Bancroft
Certainly, Mr. Brooks and Ms. Bancroft are one of Hollywood's greatest love stories. People considered them an odd couple, the short comic with the funny mug and Brooklyn accent, and the gorgeous actress who created the indelible portrait of the panther-like seductress and pre-cougar, Mrs. Robinson, in "The Graduate," even though she was only 35 to Dustin Hoffman's 30.
But they fell in love nearly instantly after meeting on the set of "The Perry Como Show." Mr. Brooks compares his wooing style to Pepper Martin, a St. Louis Cardinals player in the '30s who was famous for stealing bases. She was also really impressed with his taxi whistle, he said.
They soon learned that they loved all the same things, from baseball to foreign movies to Chinese food. And if Anne loved something Mel didn't know about, like opera, he decided to love it, too. "Anne was Catholic, a good Catholic," Mr. Brooks said. "I lived with her for so long, I started crossing myself." There was none of the A-lister married to A-lister angst that Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward experienced.
He was broke, so it was tough to court the more famous actress, who had already been in a spate of movies and had won two Tonys for "Two for the Seesaw" and "The Miracle Worker."
"We'd go to a restaurant and she would slip me a couple of $ 20 bills under the table so it looked like I was paying for the meal," he said. Once, when he told the waiter to keep the change, he said, "We got outside, she hit me with her purse as hard as she could. She said, 'Are you crazy? As long as I'm paying for it, be careful with the tipping."'
Even after they had been married for about 35 years, the thrill was still there. As she put it to The New York Daily News: "I get excited when I hear his key in the door. It's like, 'Ooh! The party's going to start!"'
After she died in 2005, felled by uterine cancer, Mr. Brooks never dated again.
"Once you are married to Anne Bancroft, others don't seem to be appealing," he said. "It's as simple as that."
After they became widowers, Mr. Brooks and Mr. Reiner often had dinner together on tray tables and watched TV at the Reiner hacienda on Rodeo Drive. In his memoir, Mr. Brooks called Mr. Reiner, who died in 2020, not only the best friend he ever had but "the best friend anyone ever had."
They talked and napped and watched "Wheel of Fortune" and then "Jeopardy," arguing over the answers. Sometimes, they watched old movies. "Once a week, I had to watch 'Random Harvest' with Ronald Colman," Mr. Brooks recalled dryly. "Carl always said, 'If you don't cry watching the end, you're not alive."'
Proudly, Mr. Brooks noted that their chairs and tray tables are now on display in the National Comedy Center in Jamestown, N.Y.
He is happy, as we end our 90-minute interview, because we have laughed a lot, and laughter, he said, is the most important thing to him.
"Money is honey, funny is money," he said blithely, echoing a Max Bialystock line from "The Producers." "I really care about saying things that make people roar with laughter. I was on the stage at Radio City Music Hall and we took questions in the last part of my standup. One of the questions was, 'What do you wear -- long shorts or briefs?' I yelled, 'Depends!' It's a thrill to get a big laugh."
Confirm or Deny
Maureen Dowd: You love schwanzstucker jokes .
Mel Brooks: Actually, Gene Wilder came up with that word while we were writing "Young Frankenstein" together.
You still like to do your wolf howl from "Young Frankenstein."
You're all wet. It's not a wolf howl. It's a cat yowl. I'll do it for you. [He does a cat yowl, based on the big alley cats he knew in Brooklyn.] Nobody does a better cat yowl than me. I could do that for a living.
You like to set the mood when you're writing.
When we were writing "Blazing Saddles," I actually wore a war bonnet. Just to stay with it, and get everybody crazy.
You preserved your hearing during the war by shoving cigarettes in your ears, but you ended up with yellow ears.
True story. When I did my first movie, "The Producers," the insurance nurse looked me over and said, "Did you have yellow fever?"
Richard Pryor, who worked on the script of "Blazing Saddles" with you, was the greatest standup comedian who ever lived.
He was. One time on a Friday night, he said, "Mel, go over to the Bitter End and sub for me, do my act. I have to be in Chicago." I found out later he had a girlfriend in Chicago. I said, "All right, what do you want me to do?" He said, "Be funny. Do my act." I went to the Bitter End and I said, "Richard couldn't make it but I'm doing his act for you. I was born in Kansas City to a big Black woman who ran a cat house and she took care of me and she taught me how to play the piano. I used to pee out the windows." I was doing his act. Afterward, he said, "Are you crazy?"
You almost cast Dustin Hoffman as the Nazi playwright in "The Producers."
I did cast him. He put that helmet on with the pigeon doody and he looked exactly like a good Nazi. Anyway, he couldn't do it because he got another job.
You have some final words from the 2,000 Year Old Man.
As the 2,000 Year Old Man, I would say be nice to everyone around you because you never know where they're going to end up. Even if you don't like them, don't let them know because they're liable to one day run a studio. They're liable to be Harry Cohn.
Your Hollywood star has one six-fingered hand.
It's true. I did it with a plaster mold just so that somebody from Idaho would scream, "Henry, come over here! Look at this. Mel Brooks has six fingers."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A haunting horror novel set a century ago in the American West, Eleanor Catton's first novel in a decade, a Ukrainian war diary and much more.
Biography of X, by Catherine Lacey
After her wife, X -- a controversial interdisciplinary artist -- dies, a former reporter sets out to write her biography. X was always circumspect about the details of her life and she harmed even those closest to her. As she writes, her widow encounters information that turns everything she knew about the woman she loved on its head. The resulting book is a novel masquerading as a fictionalized biography and painful emotional inquiry.
Farrar, Straus and Giroux, March 21
Birnam Wood, by Eleanor Catton
Catton returns with her first novel in 10 years, after her debut, "The Luminaries," won the Booker Prize. In New Zealand, Mira runs Birnam Wood, a "guerrilla gardening group" that plants food and flowers on land where they think no one will notice -- their way of cultivating sustenance outside a capitalist system. When Mira makes a pact with a tech billionaire to secure the group's future, it sets the groundwork for a collision of values.
Farrar, Straus and Giroux, March 7
Flux, by Jinwoo Chong
The lives of three characters converge in this time-traveling debut novel. They're all grieving in some fashion -- Bo's mother died when he was a child, Brandon lost his job and Blue is struggling to reconnect with his family. Along the way, the novel brings in the story of a famous detective show, giving it a noirish, and speculative, bent.
Melville House, March 21
Hello Beautiful, by Ann Napolitano
There are some subtle parallels with "Little Women" in Napolitano's latest novel, which follows the relationship between William, who grew up in an emotionally chilly home, and Julia. Julia's family -- particularly her three sisters -- is warm, mildly chaotic and creative, with each sister playing a specific role (the dreamer, the caregiver). After William and Julia's marriage unravels, the family confronts an existential crisis as their loyalty and love are tested.
Dial Press, March 14
Humanly Possible: Seven Hundred Years of Humanist Freethinking, Inquiry, and Hope, by Sarah Bakewell
In her earlier books, "At the Existentialist Café" and "How to Live," Bakewell introduced readers to the major questions facing the existentialist philosophers. Now, she looks at the long tradition of humanism -- which poses the deceptively simple question of what it means to be human -- weighing the importance of moral versus cultural output, and putting a wide array of thinkers across time and place in dialogue.
Penguin Press, March 28
Lone Women, by Victor LaValle
This new book from the author of "The Changeling" reads like a Western horror story. It's 1915 California, and Adelaide, a young Black woman, flees for Montana after her parents die, hoping to become a homesteader. At first, she is welcomed there, but the unbearable secrets of her past -- symbolized by the mysterious steamer trunk she lugs with her -- threaten her new life.
One World, March 28
The New Earth, by Jess Row
In this new novel, a white, Jewish Manhattan family is rocked by the revelation that its matriarch is half-Black. Soon after, one of the children, working as an activist in the West Bank, is killed by an Israeli soldier. A wedding forces the remaining family members to confront these wounds and decide whether they can rebuild, playing with themes that Row has raised in his earlier writing; his essay collection, "White Flights," looked at what American literature could -- and couldn't -- tell readers about race in the United States.
Ecco, March 28
The Odyssey of Phillis Wheatley: A Poet's Journeys Through American Slavery and Independence, by David Waldstreicher
Wheatley was a young child when she arrived in the United States from West Africa and was sold to a Boston family. Within years, she became the most prominent African American poet of the 18th century. Other studies of her life have focused on her role in trans-Atlantic literature, but Waldstreicher makes the point that beyond that, she was a brilliant writer who was, as Waldstreicher puts it, an "organic intellectual of the enslaved."
Farrar, Straus and Giroux, March 7
Pineapple Street, by Jenny Jackson
In her debut novel, a book editor follows a stratospherically wealthy Brooklyn Heights family as they navigate questions of privilege, love and belonging. (A representative piece of dialogue: "Oh no! I left my Cartier bracelet in Lena's BMW and she's leaving soon for her grandmother's house in Southampton!")
Pamela Dorman Books, March 7
Poverty, by America, by Matthew Desmond
In his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, "Evicted," Desmond, a sociologist, looked at how the wave of evictions after the 2008 financial crash helped engender cycles of poverty. Now, he investigates income inequality in the United States, arguing that the behavior and decisions of wealthy Americans has caused the poverty crisis to endure. He puts it bluntly: "Tens of millions of Americans do not end up poor by a mistake of history or personal conduct. Poverty persists because some wish and will it to."
Crown, March 21
Saving Time: Discovering a Life Beyond the Clock, by Jenny Odell
Odell's previous book, "How to Do Nothing," set off a cultural reckoning: She argued that attention is our most precious resource -- and that to honor its importance, we should invest it in solitude and contemplation. Now, she looks at our understanding of time itself, examining its links to modern ideas around productivity and even climate change.
Random House, March 7
Skinfolk: A Memoir, by Matthew Pratt Guterl
In 1970s New Jersey, Guterl's parents adopted children from Korea, Vietnam and the South Bronx, dreaming of raising a family that, including their two white biological children, was a sort of Noah's ark, with "two of every race." Guterl, now a historian of race at Brown University, writes poignantly about his upbringing, particularly as the family and his siblings battled xenophobia and racism.
Liveright, March 28
The Undertow: Scenes From a Slow Civil War, by Jeff Sharlet
Sharlet has written extensively about religion, fundamentalism and American politics. In a new book, he explores the various forces at play on the far right -- including the rage and paranoia that fuels the movement -- at a time when many in it are preparing for a civil war.
Norton, March 21
War Diary, by Yevgenia Belorusets. Translated by Greg Nissan.
Belorusets, an artist and writer from Kyiv, was in Ukraine when Russia invaded her country, and immediately felt the need to document the effects of the war on ordinary citizens. The book's entries touch on the newfound danger in what used to be commonplace activities and even the dissonance of enjoying a beautiful spring day as war rages on.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In his tender and gruff directorial debut, Michael B. Jordan again takes the lead, this time alongside Jonathan Majors as a childhood friend who has reappeared.
The tears flow as freely as the blood in "Creed III," the latest entry in the apparently indestructible "Rocky" saga. Once again, Adonis Creed -- the tough but tender, gruff but gentle heavyweight boxer played by Michael B. Jordan -- must be knocked down so that he can rise higher still. That story line is a metaphor for life, no doubt. It's also a perfect distillation of this franchise, which has had repeated ups and downs during its staggering 47-year run.
In 1976, the year that Sylvester Stallone's Rocky sprinted up the long steps leading to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Gerald R. Ford was president and most of the principal cast of "Creed III" wasn't yet born. The 2015 release of "Creed," seventh in the series, inaugurated a narrative shift that found Rocky taking on the role of the avuncular trainer, a part he also played three years later in the sequel. Stallone isn't in this latest chapter. While his absence has obvious resonance, if you were expecting some kind of Hamlet-style anguish or even a hint of misty melancholia about the now-absent symbolic father, forget it. This isn't the Sly Stallone show; it's Michael B. Jordan's, from first scene to last.
For this installment, Jordan has taken over as both the star and the director (it's his feature debut), twinned roles that he has assumed with seamless assurance. As entertaining as it is predictable, "Creed III" does exactly what you expect, delivering nicely balanced helpings of intimacy and spectacle, grit and glamour. It's enjoyably old-school Hollywood in how squarely it hits all the familiar genre beats -- even as it pragmatically advances the series -- yet it's also very much of the moment in how it grapples with family, friendship and the complexities of contemporary masculinity, its pleasures and its burdens.
Every boxer needs a challenger, a hard body to spar with physically and otherwise. Here, that foe is Damian, a childhood friend of Adonis (Donnie to his pals), a walking wound played as an adult by Jonathan Majors. (In flashback, Spence Moore II and Thaddeus James Mixson Jr. play the characters as adolescents.) After the usual recap -- now retired, Donnie is fabulously successful and settled down with his family -- Damian appears in a hoodie one day outside Donnie's gym while leaning on the champ's Rolls-Royce. It's an image that's more biting than any line of dialogue, all the more so because an irritated Donnie doesn't at first recognize Damian, a scene that Jordan invests with dramatic tension and visceral unease.
That sense of disquiet remains as an enigmatically wary Donnie and an unreadable Damian share a meal and guarded laughs, and the story's (too) many pieces begin sharply clicking into place. The movie is a continuation of Creed's story, and a further burnishing of a new big-screen myth -- one that is now refracted through Damian and his desire to get back into the ring. A Golden Gloves fighter as a teen, Damian wants to reclaim his boxing glory and resume a trajectory cut short by prison. That's exactly what happens, more or less, despite Donnie's reservations, the strong objections of his business partner, Tony (Wood Harris), and some complications with Donnie's mother, Mary-Anne (Phylicia Rashad).
Like many actors-turned-directors, Jordan does very fine work with the performers, including in his scenes with Tessa Thompson, who again plays Bianca, his lover and now wife. Her character doesn't have all that much to do (a musician, she has given up performing), but Thompson's charisma ensures that the character never registers like an afterthought or an appendage to the male protagonist. There's no question that Jordan is the star, as his ample screen time affirms -- the man certainly knows his best camera angles and when to strip down -- but what gives the movie interest and heft is how it insistently deploys other characters to complicate and recast the classic figure of the rugged American individual.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Like "Rocky" was for Stallone, the first "Creed" served as a breakthrough for Jordan and for its director, Ryan Coogler, who have become entertainment-world juggernauts. Stallone's presence in the earlier "Creed" movies ensured that the franchise remained tethered to his legacy, with its sequels and fraught semiotics, even if the titles no longer carried the Rocky name. Instructively, the first "Creed" ends with Donnie and Rocky side by side; the second restlessly cuts between the two, as if asking for you to choose between them. The choice has now been made, and with the shift from Rocky to Creed the franchise has moved to fertile new ground. (Coogler and Stallone remain attached to the series as producers; Coogler also shares the story credit with the screenwriters, his brother Keegan Coogler and Zach Baylin.)
"Nobody owes nobody nothing," Rocky says in the first film, a philosophical declaration from a white working-class striver who can seem alone even when he's with other people and whose self-reliance puts him on a continuum with other bootstrapping self-mythologizers. In "Creed III," Donnie has his share of lonely moments, too, but the story continually puts him into play with other people, including in tender scenes of him caring for his and Bianca's daughter (Mila Davis-Kent). In contrast to, say, those dead-mom movies in which men take over for absent mothers, Donnie shares parenting duties. He is responsible for -- and to -- other people and deeply connected to a community that, however anxiously, includes Damian, who isn't a combative stranger but an old friend, as well as a reminder of a fate escaped.
"Creed III" suffers from the customary franchise bloat, and the ending is rushed and underdeveloped. It's also bogged down by a tragic subplot that feels expedient (you can sense the next movie being plotted out as it unfolds), but that also gives Donnie a narrative rationale to shed copious tears, which Jordan does with aching vulnerability. There's art and craft in those tears. There is also, well, a creed. And as emotion floods this movie, Jordan lets loose a torrent of ideas about Black masculinity and community, about how the past haunts the present, the legacy of state violence, the chimera of self-reliance and the existential necessity of love. So, come for the boxing, yes -- but bring plenty of hankies, too.

Full text: Jenny Jackson, a publishing executive with a stellar record as an editor, has a novel of her own, "Pineapple Street." With it come uncertainties she has long helped her authors navigate.
Jenny Jackson means onetime Brooklyn Heights resident Truman Capote no disrespect, and his quote "I live in Brooklyn. By choice" serves as an epigraph to "Pineapple Street," her first novel. But Jackson sets off on a walking tour with a different Brooklyn Heights in her sights.
She gestures toward the red brick Heights Casino, where the novel's old-money Brooklyn plays tennis year-round, and the St. George Hotel, which catered to Brooklyn's rich of the Jazz Age. There's the imposing bay-windowed house on Columbia Heights that inspired the heirloom-stuffed limestone at the heart of the book. And the Joe Coffee on the corner of Pineapple and Hicks streets is where Georgiana, the youngest daughter of "Pineapple Street"'s adamantly Social Register Stockton family, utters the immortal line, "Oh no, I left my Cartier tennis bracelet in Lena's BMW and she's leaving for her grandmother's house in Southampton" as she is fatefully spotted by the reluctant heir to a zillion-dollar defense fortune.
Darley, Georgiana's older sister, is a former finance crusher and increasingly reluctant stay-at- $ 10-million-home mom, while their mother, a ski-pole-thin event planner, has never met an issue of the Yale Alumni Magazine she didn't scour for prospects for her unmarried daughter. Stuck, uncomfortably, in the middle, is Sasha, the middle-class New England girl who has married their brother, Cord, and, despite all signs to the contrary, is referred to as "the Gold Digger" by her sisters-in-law.
"It's the novel Jane Austen would have written," said the author Chris Bohjalian, "if Jane Austen lived in Brooklyn Heights in the 21st century."
But Jane Austen didn't hold a high-profile position in publishing, as well: Jackson, the author with a splashy debut on her hands, is also a vice-president and executive editor at Alfred A. Knopf. Bohjalian is one of her authors.
Jackson's foray into writing came as a surprise to most who know her, not least those who have known her as editor, and raised questions: How will Jackson deploy her skills in her new circumstances? And what does it feel like to be on the other side of the author-publisher relationship?
"It was like finding out your spouse is an Olympic equestrian," said the author Kevin Kwan, who hit the publishing stratosphere with Jackson as his editor on "Crazy Rich Asians." "Or better, given her natural skills, an Olympic gymnast."
Since joining Vintage, Knopf's paperback arm, in 2002, fresh out of Williams and the Columbia Publishing Course, and segueing to Knopf's hardcover shop nine years after that, Jackson, 43, has established herself as a literary hitmaker with a track record of fostering best-selling authors who straddle the line between literary and commercial fiction, and nonfiction on occasion as well. With a vociferously loyal roster that ranges from such authors as Gabrielle Zevin and Emily St. John Mandel to Bohjalian, Peter Heller, Katherine Heiny, Jennifer Close, Esmeralda Santiago, Helen Ellis and the actress Selma Blair, she is also considered extraordinarily adept at helping market and promote her authors.
Zevin's star-crossed gamers saga, "Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow," topped Amazon's list of Best Books of 2022, ended up a Jimmy Fallon Book Club pick, and got a rare John Green recommendation. Almost the minute that Amazon's Times Square billboard went up trumpeting the novel as its "#1" choice, Jackson shared it on her busy Instagram.
"She's a complete star," said the literary agent Amanda Urban, who, 10 years ago -- on the advice of the late Sonny Mehta, Jackson's boss and mentor -- entrusted Cormac McCarthy and his long-gestating works in progress to a young Jackson. The two linked novels McCarthy delivered were heavy on esoteric mathematics, physics and intelligence theory.
"More than anyone around," Urban said of Jackson, "she instinctively knew how to talk about these books." "The Passenger," published in October of last year, and "Stella Maris," released in December, were greeted as a triumphant comeback for McCarthy.
Jackson said she was almost as surprised as the rest of the publishing world that she'd written a novel. Like countless others, she had felt isolated and unsettled as the pandemic "changed the world and the way we lived," she said. Far from her normal epicenter among a younger cohort spanning a swath of publishing houses and literary agencies, Jackson wrote the novel, she said, in place of being able to talk and gossip and socialize with what had seemed to have become a vanished world.
For the first six months of the pandemic, she and her husband, Torrey Liddell -- a partner at the production company Surreel Films -- and their two young children lived with his parents at their country house in Sharon, Conn., not far from Hotchkiss, where both Liddell and his father had gone to boarding school. "I love Torrey's family," Jackson said, "but they're not my family." The complications of marrying into someone else's family drive "Pineapple Street"'s fish-out-of-gene-pool plot.
The question around Viking and its Pamela Dorman imprint is whether the book, which comes out March 7 with an announced first printing of 50,000, could emerge as a "Sex and the City" that gets its sugar rush not at Magnolia Bakery but at Le French Tart on Henry Street where Jackson favors the almond croissants. Sold in a pre-emptive deal for a reported seven figures in April 2021, the novel is under option as a TV series by the production company PictureStart. Although Publishers Weekly called it "a clever if tepid debut," Kirkus Reviews judged the novel a "remarkably enjoyable visit with the annoying one percent, as close to crazy rich WASPs as WASPs can get."
Jackson wrote "Pineapple Street" in just four months after she read The New York Times article "The Rich Kids Who Want to Tear Down Capitalism," about millennial one-percenters' distinctly ambivalent relationship with the millions they stand to inherit. The conundrum visits the Stocktons in "Pineapple Street" when Georgiana grows a social conscience and decides to give away her trust fund.
The book's approaching launch has Park Avenue on high alert. The Colony Club and the Cosmo Club have asked about hosting events with Jackson. She said she remembers the first time she was invited to lunch at the Colony Club. Still an entry-level editorial assistant, she arrived wearing black jeans, "the nice J. Crew kind," Jackson said with a laugh. Lunch had to be moved. She never made a mistake like that again.
"For someone who's written a novel about class, I came to it surprisingly late," said Jackson, who was raised in Ipswich, Mass., and attended a small progressive private school where teachers were called by their first names. She used to pass John Updike's house there when she went for a run, she said. Now she is rereading his book "Couples" because she's setting her next novel there.
In contrast, at Williams, where she studied poetry, she said she discovered that "there was a whole group of kids who took private planes for spring break."
As a seasoned editor, Jackson has witnessed the eggshell egos and creative struggles of many of her authors, and has ridden the ups and downs of their insecurities and rough drafts. "Pineapple Street" had the potential of throwing the same emotional obstacle course her way.
J. Courtney Sullivan, whose first novel, "Commencement," began her string of best sellers with Jackson, talked through some of those vulnerabilities with her, she said, and "how, as a writer, you have to put so much of yourself out there, and the risks that holds, the vulnerability."
Jennifer Close, who has been with Jackson since they made "Girls in White Dresses" a best seller in 2011, exchanged texts with her almost daily. "The first time she got notes back for revisions," Close said, "she texted me, 'I hate revising. This is miserable. How do you not hate me?' It was funny, because she's a person her authors love."
"I feel like I've always been sensitive to my authors," Jackson said. "But it's gone up a level. I'm never going to just dismiss a rude email one of them gets ever again."
No one does fun like Jackson, her authors say, while keeping her editorial focus paper-cut sharp. She is a perpetual standout at the competitive game nights that Ellis holds as fund-raisers every year for One Story magazine. At the last gathering, Jackson dipped into the Truth or Dare bag for extra points and found herself drawing a Sharpie tattoo of a skull and cross bones on Bohjalian's arm.
Jackson likes to joke that she "has the most boring résumé in publishing" because she hasn't exactly moved around in her career. Zevin frames it differently, describing Jackson, and her trajectory, as a full-blown video game.
"A plucky adventurer," Zevin wrote in an email, "let's call her Jenny Jackson, because honestly, this is a very good video game character name! -- travels through worlds to collect a series of tomes that, in combination, will unlock the secrets of civilization and maybe even save it!
"Her quest will take her from a post-apocalyptic landscape in the Midwest, to the elite world of the ultrarich in Singapore, and to many worlds in between. To collect the tomes, she must be highly observant, empathetic, and a master of language and transformation.
"In the final level, she reaches a world that is unexpected, but strangely familiar: It's a world of her own devising."

NEW YORK — Jenny Jackson means onetime Brooklyn Heights resident Truman Capote no disrespect, and his quote “I live in Brooklyn. By choice” serves as an epigraph to “Pineapple Street,” her first novel. But Jackson sets off on a walking tour with a different Brooklyn Heights in her sights.
She gestures toward the red brick Heights Casino, where the novel’s old-money Brooklyn plays tennis year-round, and the St. George Hotel, which catered to Brooklyn’s rich of the Jazz Age. There’s the imposing bay-windowed house on Columbia Heights that inspired the heirloom-stuffed limestone at the heart of the book. And the Joe Coffee on the corner of Pineapple and Hicks streets is where Georgiana, the youngest daughter of the novel’s adamantly Social Register Stockton family, utters the immortal line, “Oh no, I left my Cartier tennis bracelet in Lena’s BMW and she’s leaving for her grandmother’s house in Southampton” as she is fatefully spotted by the reluctant heir to a zillion-dollar defense fortune.
Darley, Georgiana’s older sister, is a former finance crusher and increasingly reluctant stay-at-$10-million-home mom, while their mother, a ski-pole-thin event planner, has never met an issue of the Yale Alumni Magazine she didn’t scour for prospects for her unmarried daughter.

With a Drone Instructor, Letting Love Take Flight: [Society Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Austin Brown taught Chelsea Wilson how to fly a drone while she was charging her phone. Love took flight later.
Chelsea Anais Wilson was on her way to meet her cousins at a magic show at Illusions Bar & Theater in downtown Baltimore in May 2019 when her phone ran out of juice.
"I was using my phone as a GPS," said Ms. Wilson, 31, who walked through a bustling Preakness Stakes Week event with dozens of booths, hoping to charge her phone at one and get her bearings.
She struck out with two vendors -- but on the third try she encountered Austin Wayne Brown, 36, a drone instructor. His booth was a 20-by-10-foot flight cage set up with six drones and several wooden horse obstacles; he was able to connect her phone to his laptop.
"She was a nice, attractive lady, and I was single," said Mr. Brown, a founder of Global Air Media, a drone services provider in Baltimore, and the Global Air Drone Academy, a nonprofit that teaches drone technology to underserved youth in hopes of encouraging STEM careers. He graduated from Salisbury University in Salisbury, Md., and received a master's degree in political management from George Washington University.
As her phone lay charging, he whisked her to the front of the line, and taught her to fly a drone. But dating was far from her mind -- even when she offered him some of her pizza.
"I was on a man fast," said Ms. Wilson, who was gearing up for a job in the Foreign Service that summer. The six-month fast, coincidentally, ended that day.
"I just wanted to start fresh mentally, spiritually and physically," she said.
Ms. Wilson, now a public diplomacy officer at the United States Department of State, finished her first tour in Rio de Janeiro last December, and is to begin another in El Salvador this summer.
She runs the blog Hey Ms. Traveler, which educates women and underrepresented youth about travel and careers in international affairs. She graduated cum laude from Juniata College in Huntingdon, Pa., and received a master's degree in international and intercultural communication from American University.
Mr. Brown later gave her his card, which she inadvertently misplaced.
No matter. A couple of days later, clear across town, in a Giant supermarket parking lot, Ms. Wilson stopped a shopping cart from careening into a silver BMW.
"Aren't you Chelsea?" asked Mr. Brown, who was carrying a 32-pack carton of water to the car, which happened to be his mother's. "I was hoping to hear from you," he said. When she explained she lost his card, he dug up another -- his last. She emailed him two days later.
A couple of weeks later, in June 2019, the two, who both grew up in Baltimore, met for lunch at Ryleigh's Oyster to vet each other before setting up a real date -- fishing in Lake Roland Park.
They spent over three hours on that date along a secluded sandy spot, quite happily, even without a catch, talking over the charcuterie he had prepared.
Their next date, at her suggestion, was roller skating, and Mr. Brown made a valiant effort to stay upright. "He was a trouper, and still is a trouper," she said, and later that evening they had their first kiss.
Before the month was up, she moved to Washington for her Foreign Service training, and to his own amazement, he began making the drive there, often an hour and a half in traffic, several times a week.
"If a woman lived more than 20 minutes from me, it was a deal breaker," Mr. Brown said of his previous approach.
In July, she found out she was posted to Rio de Janeiro. "One doesn't have to wait more than two years to know they want to get married," she told him around that time.
But after Covid-19 hit, her two-year deployment was delayed until the end of 2020.
"I'll be right behind you," said Mr. Brown, who boarded a nearly empty plane in 2021 to visit her just in time for Valentine's Day. In July of that year, when she visited Baltimore, he proposed close to the spot of their first date along Lake Roland.
On Feb. 11, the Rev. Gemechu Y. Raga, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony at Cathedral of Mary Our Queen in Baltimore, where the couple, who now lives in Washington, jumped the broom before 150 guests, and then celebrated nearby at the Vollmer Center, an events space inside the Cylburn Arboretum.
"I travel for work overseas," she said. "I wanted to come home to Baltimore for my wedding. I wanted my grandmother to be there."

Full text: The actor plays John B. in the hit Netflix drama, which returns for its third season on Thursday.
Before Chase Stokes started playing John B., the teenage treasure hunter at the center of "Outer Banks," on Netflix, he played a fictional Hollywood manager, mass emailing talent agencies to tout an up-and-coming young actor named Chase Stokes.
He also worked as a bartender and a food photographer to make ends meet, and he spent months couch-surfing and occasionally sleeping in his 2009 BMW in the parking lot of the Ovation Hollywood (formerly Hollywood and Highland) mall as he took acting classes.
Despite his circumstances, Stokes said he initially turned down offers to audition for "Outer Banks" -- it felt like a "Goonies" remake, and he didn't want to besmirch a classic, he said. But eventually an apartment eviction notice and his car's overheating engine and expired tags convinced him to give it a shot. He considers himself lucky that he did.
"But I think luck is when consistency and determination and hard work meet," Stokes said.
"Outer Banks" is a teen drama about a group of attractive young adventurers (known as "pogues") battling their island community's rich kids ("kooks") and chasing treasure linked to the disappearance of John B.'s father. It debuted in 2020 but broke out when its second season premiered in July 2021, becoming Netflix's most watched English-language series globally for four weeks. A fan event to promote the third season drew more than 4,000 attendees to Huntington Beach, Calif., on Saturday, to watch performances by acts like Khalid and Lil Baby. The cast also took the stage to announce that the show had already been renewed for a fourth season.
Season 3 of "Outer Banks" begins on Thursday, following John B. and the other pogues as they take on new territory in another quest for gold after the first two seasons saw them successfully scavenge and subsequently lose treasures in the Outer Banks of North Carolina. The crew was last seen on a deserted island they had named Poguelandia, and the unexpected discovery of John B.'s presumed-dead father, Big John (played by Charles Halford), sparks a new itch to uncover yet another bounty.
In a video call from a West Hollywood hotel, Stokes talked about how he initially declined the role that has made him famous and what "Outer Banks" says about friendship and the class divide. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
You initially turned down the "Outer Banks" audition. What convinced you to reconsider?
I really wasn't making money as an actor up until the job that I did right before "Outer Banks," which was a show on Amazon called "Tell Me Your Secrets." But the money had kind of run dry from that show -- I had an eviction notice on my door, the registration on my car had expired, my engine was steaming everywhere I went. I'm not a mechanic, so I didn't know how to fix it, nor did I have the money to do so.
After declining the "Outer Banks" audition a couple of times I got a call from Lisa Fincannon, a wonderful casting director, and she said, "You need to read for this." That was a Wednesday. Sunday came around, and I get a call and [my agent] said: "You're getting on a plane tonight. Here's 14 pages of dialogue. Here's the first four episodes. You're going to be on the very last row of a plane in the middle seat on a red eye, and you're going to land in Charleston. The audition is right when you get off the plane." And I did it, and the rest is history.
How would you describe "Outer Banks" to someone who hasn't seen it?
If "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "Scooby-Doo" had a baby, and that baby became best friends with "The Goonies."
Was there anything about John B. that you particularly related to?
I feel like on the exterior, there are a lot of similarities. I grew up on the water; I grew up in Florida, about 30 minutes away from Cocoa Beach, so [I was familiar with] the surfing elements. I got my boater's license before I got my driver's license. I think one thing John B. goes through, especially in the third season, that I really related to was the anxiety of the world around him and the fear of failure. That's something that I've kind of always felt, so we definitely share that.
When did you know the show was a hit?
I think it was six months after the show came out when they finally told us we were going back for the second season. During Covid, seeing hundreds and hundreds of people show up to watch us film -- that was when I think we started to put two and two together.
They would follow our base camp. All of our trailers would set up in different areas of Charleston, and it would be like an alarm or a mass text would be sent out: You'd see people start to trickle in, and sometimes it'd be 20 people, sometimes it would be 2,000.
What have been some of your more interesting fan interactions?
I've had people who've fainted in front of me, and we've had people who have cried. I've had people telling me that I saved their lives, which is always interesting, to know the show has helped people through a troubling time in human history. So the range of emotions is super vast, but all equally heartwarming.
And now it's really cool because the whole Charleston community has really accepted us, and you walk down the street or you go to a restaurant and people kind of give you a wink or a thumbs up.
Are you going to the Poguelandia event?
Of course.
Where did the concert concept come from?
We haven't had a premiere; the show never had a red carpet. We've worked incredibly hard to create something the world has consumed at a really crazy rate, and obviously the platform sees it, and they wanted to congratulate us. I think it's an ode to the show: The show is kind of a party; it's kind of a riot. So why not throw a music festival?
"Outer Banks" revolves largely around the class divide between the working-class pogues and the wealthy kooks. Is there a message in there about class discrimination?
I think it's a testament to how there has consistently been a class divide not just in this country, but in the world. And the lower class is going to fight tooth and nail to find a way to make an extra buck, and the upper class is going to find a way to save an extra couple thousand bucks. There's a frustration that's inevitably going to be there, and I think that's the driving factor for the pogues. They're right there, you know? They can see it. It's so close to them, but they just can't comprehend how to get there.
What does the show say about friendship?
It's every kid's dream to have a group of friends who are going to ride or die and just go the distance with you, and these kids have grown up in an environment where they don't have a lot. So they learn to do a lot with a little, and it's a beautiful thing to see. I'm very proud and thankful to be part of a project that gives a true interpretation of friendship -- not just the highs of it but also the lows and showing just as much love as when the wins come around.
Has this friendship onscreen translated into one among the actors when the cameras are off?
All of us came into the show with slim-pickings resumes. So to get into this and to feel like we need to create this truth and transparency through these characters, you sort of fall in love with one another and build this crazy camaraderie and chemistry.
Do you think this friendship will carry beyond the show itself? How long do you think it will last?
I hope forever. It's been almost four years now, and I hope we do another 40.

Electric Vehicle Prices Are Closing In on Gas Cars: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Competition, government incentives and falling raw material prices are making battery-powered cars more affordable sooner than expected.
More quickly than seemed possible a few months ago, sticker prices for electric vehicles are falling closer to the point where they could soon be on a par with gasoline cars.
Increased competition, government incentives and falling prices for lithium and other battery materials are making electric vehicles noticeably more affordable. The tipping point when electric vehicles become as cheap as or cheaper than cars with internal combustion engines could arrive this year for some mass market models and is already the case for some luxury vehicles.
Prices are likely to continue trending lower as Tesla, General Motors, Ford Motor and their battery suppliers ramp up new factories, reaping the cost savings that come from mass production. New electric vehicles from companies like Volkswagen, Nissan and Hyundai will add to competitive pressure.
The battery-powered version of G.M.'s Equinox crossover, for example, will start around $ 30,000 when it arrives this fall, the carmaker has said. That is $ 3,400 more than the least expensive gasoline-fueled Equinox. But factoring in government incentives, the electric Equinox should be cheaper. Like all electric vehicles, the car will need less maintenance, and the electricity to power it will cost less than the gasoline used by its combustion engine equivalent.
Only a few months ago, electric vehicle buyers faced long waiting lists, and dealers marked up sticker prices by thousands of dollars. Used electric vehicles sometimes sold for more than new ones because buyers were willing to pay a premium to get one right away. At the end of 2022, the average price of an electric vehicle was $ 61,488, compared with $ 49,507 for all passenger cars and trucks, according to Kelley Blue Book.
There are still waiting lists for some models like the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck, but it has become easier and cheaper to find and buy new and used electric models.
The first major crack in the trend of rising prices came in January when Tesla cut prices for the Model 3 and Model Y, the two best-selling electric cars, by thousands of dollars. With a starting price of $ 43,500 before government incentives, a Model 3 is now $ 300 less than the least expensive BMW 3 Series sedan. A Model Y, at $ 55,000 before tax credits, costs about as much as a comparable Lexus RX.
Ford also cut the price of its Mustang Mach-E, the best-selling electric vehicle in the United States after the Teslas. Even Lucid Motors, a maker of expensive electric sedans that do not qualify for tax credits, is feeling pressure to cut prices and this week began offering $ 7,500 discounts on cars that start at $ 107,400.
Tesla "saw there is increasing competition and some of the competition is quite good," said Brian Moody, executive editor for Kelley Blue Book. He added, "If the No. 1 seller of a certain type of car reduces their prices, that is going to have an impact on the average."
Major impetus for the price cuts came from the Inflation Reduction Act, legislation passed by Democrats in Congress last year that provides tax credits of up to $ 7,500 for electric car buyers. To qualify, battery-powered or plug-in hybrid sedans have to sell for less than $ 55,000, while pickups and sport utility vehicles qualify only if the retail price is below $ 80,000. By cutting prices, Ford and Tesla increased the number of models that could benefit from the tax credits.
Manufacturers "are working to continue to pull in shoppers by making these vehicles eligible for tax credits," said Jenni Newman, editor in chief of Cars.com, an online auto sales site.
Potentially more significant are subsidies paid to companies that manufacture batteries in the United States, part of a drive by the Biden administration to establish a domestic supply chain and reduce dependence on China.
The subsidies, which were also part of the Inflation Reduction Act, could cut the cost of making electric vehicles by as much as $ 9,000. That break and the tax credits for buyers of electric cars could allow battery-powered vehicles to achieve price parity with gasoline cars as soon as this year, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research and advocacy group. That is three to five years sooner than would be the case without incentives.
"If the automakers pass that on to consumers, consumers will really benefit," said Stephanie Searle, a program director at the council who oversees research on passenger vehicles.
Declines in new car prices are pushing down used electric vehicle prices, too. They have fallen 17 percent since July, according to Recurrent, which tracks the used car market. That's largely because Tesla cut the price of the Model 3 and G.M. lowered the price of the Chevrolet Bolt by almost $ 6,000 last year. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, used cars can also qualify for a tax credit of up to $ 4,000. That is important because most people buy used vehicles.
Falling prices for materials like lithium and cobalt have also helped. The price of lithium used in batteries has fallen 20 percent from its peak in November, though the metal still costs more than twice as much as it did at the end of 2021. Cobalt has fallen by more than half since May, in part because carmakers are selling some models that do not require it, reducing demand.
New lithium mines are beginning to produce ore, which could keep a lid on prices. Sigma Lithium will begin shipping raw material from a site in Brazil to LG Energy Solution, its main customer, as early as April, Ana Cabral Gardner, Sigma Lithium's chief executive, said in an interview. The site will be the first new source of lithium in Latin America for several years.
"It's doable, and we're there," Ms. Cabral Gardner said.
Of course, these advantages could fade because of new supply chain problems. Lithium remains in short supply, and prices could spike again. Beginning next month, new regulations governing the $ 7,500 tax credits will require electric car batteries to be made in the United States, Canada or Mexico with raw materials from North America or another U.S. trade ally. It is unclear how many vehicles will meet those requirements.
Right now, the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits are available to vehicles assembled in North America, which partly shields the U.S. automakers from competitors like Hyundai. The company's Ioniq 5 has sold well, but it is imported from South Korea. Hyundai is building a factory in Georgia that will start assembling electric vehicles in 2025. (Buyers may still collect a tax credit indirectly if they lease foreign-made electric vehicles.)
The Treasury Department, which is responsible for carrying out the Inflation Reduction Act, gave in to auto industry lobbying this month and classified several popular crossovers as S.U.V.s rather than sedans. That allows vehicles like the Mustang Mach-E and all versions of the Model Y to qualify for tax credits if they sell for $ 80,000 or less. Before that change, the Mustang and lighter versions of the Model Y were classified as sedans, subject to the $ 55,000 limit.
The decision removes some pressure on the carmakers to keep prices low. Tesla quickly raised the price of the Model Y by $ 2,000. Ford said it had no plans to raise prices of the Mach-E.
The Inflation Reduction Act is also under attack by many congressional Republicans even though automakers and battery companies are building factories in states, like South Carolina, Texas and Tennessee, where voters tend to elect Republicans.
But arguably the most powerful force driving down prices is not the commodity markets or Washington.
As electric vehicle sales soar -- rising 66 percent in the United States last year to 810,000, according to Kelley Blue Book -- automakers are getting better at making them. Ford has reduced the weight of the Mach-E by 70 pounds, increasing range and lowering cost, by eliminating some wiring, Jim Farley, the company's chief executive, told investors this month.
General Motors and LG Energy Solution began producing batteries at a new plant in Ohio last year through a joint venture, Ultium Cells. A second Ultium plant, in Tennessee, is expected to begin production this year, and a third is slated for Michigan. Generally speaking, costs come down as companies produce more of a product.
Auto executives say they are finding it is easier and cheaper to design and build new electric models than gasoline-powered ones.
The battery cells made by Ultium, for example, are part of a collection of components that can be mixed and matched in many types of vehicles. Carmakers have long used the same platforms in multiple models, but the strategy works even better with electric vehicles because the cars have far fewer parts than internal combustion vehicles.
The Ultium platform cuts the time needed to develop a new vehicle by almost two years, Dan Nicholson, vice president of electrification at G.M., said at a Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago conference in January.
As a result, G.M. will be able to introduce three Chevrolet electric vehicles this year: the Equinox, a Silverado pickup truck and a Blazer S.U.V. "That's how we get the economies of scale," Mr. Nicholson said.
Suppliers have been looking for efficiencies, too. Matthews International, based in Pittsburgh, has developed a process for coating the metal foil that separates the positive and negative electrodes of a battery. Instead of a liquid solution, the process uses a powder.
The process requires less equipment and a lot less space, said Greg Babe, the company's chief technology officer. Those kinds of incremental improvements reduce costs without major technical breakthroughs.
Interest in the approach developed by Matthews has soared since President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act. "It changed almost overnight," Mr. Babe said. "The floodgates opened."

Ford Plans Battery Factory Using Chinese Technology: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ford's $ 3.5 billion plant in Michigan will draw on technology from CATL, a Chinese company that is the world's No. 1 maker of electric-car batteries.
Ford Motor said on Monday that it planned to build a $ 3.5 billion electric-vehicle battery factory in Michigan using technology licensed from a Chinese company that has become one of the most important players in the auto industry.
The plant, to be built in Marshall, a rural town about 100 miles west of Detroit, will be the latest in a growing list of new battery and electric-car factories that companies have announced in recent months. Ford expects to employ about 2,500 people at the plant and begin production in 2026.
The automaker said it would own 100 percent of the plant and make battery cells using technology and services from Contemporary Amperex Technology Limited, known as CATL. The company, the world's largest producer of batteries for electric vehicles, has 13 factories of its own in Europe and Asia but none in the United States.
Just a quarter-century ago, Chinese officials were eagerly asking U.S. automakers to bring their investments and expertise to China. Today, the roles are reversed, with one of America's most storied industrial giants asking China for the technology needed to survive in a rapidly changing global automotive landscape.
"This will help us build more E.V.s faster," William Clay Ford Jr., the company's executive chairman, said on Monday. He added that CATL would "help us get up to speed so we can build the batteries ourselves."
The alliance comes at a time of considerable tension between Washington and Beijing, after the United States shot down a Chinese surveillance balloon off the coast of South Carolina on Feb. 4. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken abruptly canceled a trip to Beijing after the spy balloon was sighted above Montana.
Two more unidentified objects were shot down late last week, one over northernmost Alaska and another over northern Canada. A fourth unidentified object was shot down on Sunday over Lake Huron, off the eastern shore of Michigan.
China on Monday accused the United States of having sent high-altitude balloons through its airspace without permission more than 10 times since the start of last year.
The balloon dispute appears to have interrupted efforts by China to attract more foreign investment after it ended nearly three years of "zero Covid" policies and began to reopen its borders. Many politicians in the United States remain wary of China and of Chinese investment.
Gov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia, a Republican, last month withdrew his state's bid for Ford's venture with CATL. He described the planned project to Bloomberg Television on Jan. 20 as a "Trojan horse" for the Communist Party of China.
Ford is seeking to insulate itself from U.S.-China tensions by opting to own the factory entirely and only licensing technology from CATL, which supplies batteries to Tesla, BMW and other large automakers.
The company said its contract with CATL includes provisions to work through difficulties that arise between the two countries. "Of course we've thought about it," Lisa Drake, Ford's vice president of E.V. industrialization, said in a conference call with reporters, without disclosing further details.
Ford, General Motors and other automakers are building other battery plants that are jointly owned with South Korean partners. Ford is building two battery plants in Kentucky and a third in Tennessee, both with SK On. G.M. recently started production at a battery plant in Ohio that it jointly owns with LG Energy Solution, and the partners are building two more plants, in Tennessee and Michigan.
Ford's new plant will produce batteries that include lithium, iron and phosphate, a combination known as LFP. These batteries are less expensive because they do not include expensive ingredients like cobalt and nickel used in other batteries. LFP batteries also have the advantage of being more durable. But batteries that contain cobalt and nickel hold more energy, allowing electric vehicles to go farther before needing to be charged.
"The whole point of this project is to lower the cost of E.V.s," Ford's chief executive, Jim Farley, said. "LFP is the most affordable battery technology."
Ford had looked at building the factory in Canada and Mexico but chose a U.S. site after the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law last year by President Biden. The act provided tax incentives to companies that build battery factories in the United States. Car buyers are also eligible for tax credits for electric vehicles made in North America that include batteries and raw materials from the region or another U.S. trade ally.
"This is the reason the I.R.A. was passed," Mr. Farley said, referring to the Marshall plant.
Ford's decision is also a big victory for Michigan. Over the past two years, automakers have chosen Southern states for more than a half-dozen auto plants.
Ford said its plant would be able to produce enough batteries for 400,000 electric vehicles a year. The company plans to use the LFP batteries in its Mustang Mach-E, a sport-utility vehicle, and the F-150 Lightning, a pickup truck, and other electric vehicles. CATL will supply Ford with LFP cells until the Marshall plant begins production.
All automakers are trying to produce more electric vehicles, sales of which jumped 66 percent last year in the United States. Ford is the second-largest seller of EVs in the U.S. after Tesla.
Ford said vehicles with LFP batteries were better suited for commuting and local driving and could be charged up to 100 percent capacity quickly. Batteries with cobalt and nickel are better for long-range driving or towing, but generally take longer to charge.
CATL has 100,000 employees around the world, mostly in China, and has been the world's largest supplier of electric car batteries for the past six years. A third of the electric cars now on the road around the world use CATL batteries.
The company is little known outside the auto industry. Robin Zeng, the founder and chief executive of CATL, set up the company in 2011 in his hometown, a previously impoverished area of fishing villages and rice paddies on the northern outskirts of Ningde, a town about halfway between Shanghai and Hong Kong.
CATL has hired thousands of engineers at low cost in a country that heavily emphasizes math and science education. The battery industry's transformation of Ningde has echoed the boom that Detroit and Midwest experienced during the U.S. car industry's heyday.
CATL has a third of its work force in Ningde, including many of its blue-collar workers. Rows of high-rise apartments have been built, holding down real estate prices to a tenth of those in cities like Beijing or Shanghai.
China almost completely closed its borders for nearly three years during the pandemic, preventing practically all foreigners from entering the country and limiting the ability of Chinese nationals to leave. CATL nonetheless negotiated global deals during this time, and began producing lithium-ion battery cells in December at a factory in Germany.
CATL also recently opened an office in Detroit to promote its batteries. A huge map of CATL's worldwide operations on the wall of a lobby museum at its headquarters has a recently added dot for the Detroit office -- except that the dot had been mistakenly placed in what appeared to be southwestern Wisconsin.
The process of making a lithium iron phosphate battery like the ones that Ford will be using could be seen on Sunday during a rare visit inside a cavernous CATL factory in Ningde.
The process starts with rolls of metal foil a tenth of the thickness of human hair. Aluminum foil is coated with an extremely thin layer of lithium, iron and phosphate, while copper foil is coated with an extremely thin layer of graphite. Large spools of the two kinds of foil, along with a third spool of very thin separators, are used to wind alternating layers together to make the core of each battery cell. The core is then clamped tightly together in a gray machine the size of a city bus.
A bright orange, 10-foot-tall robot, like the ones used in car assembly plant welding lines, picks up rows of battery cores and puts them into a cold press for compression. The cores then go through a kiln that heats them to 105 degrees Celsius (221 degrees Fahrenheit) to steam away any trace of water. The 300-yard-long hall in which the batteries are made is already kept much drier than even the Sahara.
After baking, liquid electrolyte -- lithium salts with a solvent -- is injected twice into each battery as an electrolyte. The batteries are then tightly sealed for delivery to customers.

Prices are likely to continue trending lower as Tesla, General Motors, Ford Motor and their battery suppliers ramp up new factories, reaping the cost savings that come from mass production. New electric vehicles from companies like Volkswagen, Nissan and Hyundai will add to competitive pressure.
The battery-powered version of GM’s Equinox crossover, for example, will start around $30,000 when it arrives this fall, the carmaker has said. That is $3,400 more than the least expensive gasoline-fueled Equinox. But factoring in government incentives, the electric Equinox should be cheaper. Like all electric vehicles, the car will need less maintenance, and the electricity to power it will cost less than the gasoline used by its combustion engine equivalent.
Only a few months ago, electric-vehicle buyers faced long waiting lists, and dealers marked up sticker prices by thousands of dollars. Used electric vehicles sometimes sold for more than new ones because buyers were willing to pay a premium to get one right away. At the end of 2022, the average price of an electric vehicle was $61,488, compared with $49,507 for all passenger cars and trucks, according to Kelley Blue Book.
There are still waiting lists for some models like the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck, but it has become easier and cheaper to find and buy new and used electric models.
The first major crack in the trend of rising prices came in January, when Tesla cut prices for the Model 3 and Model Y, the two bestselling electric cars, by thousands of dollars. With a starting price of $43,500 before government incentives, a Model 3 is now $300 less than the least expensive BMW 3 Series sedan. A Model Y, at $55,000 before tax credits, costs about as much as a comparable Lexus RX.
Ford also cut the price of its Mustang Mach-E, the bestselling electric vehicle in the United States after the Teslas. Even Lucid Motors, a maker of expensive electric sedans that do not qualify for tax credits, is feeling pressure to cut prices and last week began offering $7,500 discounts on cars that start at $107,400.
Tesla “saw there is increasing competition, and some of the competition is quite good,” said Brian Moody, executive editor for Kelley Blue Book. He added, “If the No. 1 seller of a certain type of car reduces their prices, that is going to have an impact on the average.”
Major impetus for the price cuts came from the Inflation Reduction Act, legislation passed by Democrats in Congress last year that provides tax credits of up to $7,500 for electric-car buyers. To qualify, battery-powered or plug-in hybrid sedans have to sell for less than $55,000, while pickups and sport utility vehicles qualify only if the retail price is below $80,000. By cutting prices, Ford and Tesla increased the number of models that could benefit from the tax credits.
Manufacturers “are working to continue to pull in shoppers by making these vehicles eligible for tax credits,” said Jenni Newman, editor-in-chief of Cars.com, an online auto-sales site.
Potentially more significant are subsidies paid to companies that manufacture batteries in the United States, part of a drive by the Biden administration to establish a domestic supply chain and reduce dependence on China.
The subsidies, which were also part of the Inflation Reduction Act, could cut the cost of making electric vehicles by as much as $9,000. That break and the tax credits for buyers of electric cars could allow battery-powered vehicles to achieve price parity with gasoline cars as soon as this year, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research and advocacy group. That is three to five years sooner than would be the case without incentives.
“If the automakers pass that on to consumers, consumers will really benefit,” said Stephanie Searle, a program director at the council who oversees research on passenger vehicles.
Declines in new-car prices are pushing down used electric-vehicle prices, too. They have fallen 17% since July, according to Recurrent, which tracks the used-car market. That’s largely because Tesla cut the price of the Model 3 and GM lowered the price of the Chevrolet Bolt by almost $6,000 last year. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, used cars can also qualify for a tax credit of up to $4,000. That is important because most people buy used vehicles.
Falling prices for materials like lithium and cobalt have also helped. The price of lithium used in batteries has fallen 20% from its peak in November, though the metal still costs more than twice as much as it did at the end of 2021. Cobalt has fallen by more than half since May, in part because carmakers are selling some models that do not require it, reducing demand.
New lithium mines are beginning to produce ore, which could keep a lid on prices. Sigma Lithium will begin shipping raw material from a site in Brazil to LG Energy Solution, its main customer, as early as April, Ana Cabral Gardner, Sigma Lithium’s chief executive, said in an interview. The site will be the first new source of lithium in Latin America for several years. “It’s doable, and we’re there,” Cabral Gardner said.
Of course, these advantages could fade because of new supply-chain problems. Lithium remains in short supply, and prices could spike again. Beginning next month, new regulations governing the $7,500 tax credits will require electric-car batteries to be made in the United States, Canada or Mexico with raw materials from North America or another U.S. trade ally. It is unclear how many vehicles will meet those requirements.
Right now, the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits are available to vehicles assembled in North America, which partially shields the U.S. automakers from competitors like Hyundai. The company’s Ioniq 5 has sold well, but it is imported from South Korea. Hyundai is building a factory in Georgia that will start assembling electric vehicles in 2025. (Buyers may still collect a tax credit indirectly if they lease foreign-made electric vehicles.)
The Treasury Department, which is responsible for carrying out the Inflation Reduction Act, gave in to auto industry lobbying this month and classified several popular crossovers as SUVs rather than sedans. That allows vehicles like the Mustang Mach-E and all versions of the Model Y to qualify for tax credits if they sell for $80,000 or less. Before that change, the Mustang and lighter versions of the Model Y were classified as sedans, subject to a $55,000 limit.
The decision removes some pressure on the carmakers to keep prices low. Tesla quickly raised the price of the Model Y by $2,000. Ford said it had no plans to raise prices of the Mach-E.
The Inflation Reduction Act is also under attack by many congressional Republicans even though automakers and battery companies are building factories in states like South Carolina, Texas and Tennessee, where voters tend to elect Republicans.
But arguably the most powerful force driving down prices is not the commodity markets or Washington.
As electric-vehicle sales soar — rising 66% in the United States last year to 810,000, according to Kelley Blue Book — automakers are getting better at making them. Ford has reduced the weight of the Mach-E by 70 pounds, increasing range and lowering cost, by eliminating some wiring, Jim Farley, the company’s chief executive, told investors this month.
GM and LG Energy Solution began producing batteries at a new plant in Ohio last year through a joint venture, Ultium Cells. A second Ultium plant, in Tennessee, is expected to begin production this year, and a third is slated for Michigan. Generally speaking, costs come down as companies produce more of a product.
Auto executives say that they are finding it is easier and cheaper to design and build new electric models than gasoline-powered ones.
The battery cells made by Ultium, for example, are part of a collection of components that can be mixed and matched in many types of vehicles. Carmakers have long used the same platforms in multiple models, but the strategy works even better with electric vehicles because the cars have far fewer parts than internal combustion vehicles.
The Ultium platform cuts the time needed to develop a new vehicle by almost two years, Dan Nicholson, vice president of electrification at GM, said at a Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago conference in January.
As a result, GM will be able to introduce three Chevrolet electric vehicles this year: the Equinox, a Silverado pickup truck and a Blazer SUV. “That’s how we get the economies of scale,” Nicholson said.
Suppliers have been looking for efficiencies, too. Matthews International, based in Pittsburgh, has developed a process for coating the metal foil that separates the positive and negative electrodes of a battery. Instead of a liquid solution, the process uses a powder.
The process requires less equipment and a lot less space, said Greg Babe, the company’s chief technology officer. Those kinds of incremental improvements reduce costs without major technical breakthroughs.
Interest in the approach developed by Matthews has soared since Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act. “It changed almost overnight,” Babe said. “The floodgates opened.”

ROMULUS, Mich. — Ford Motor said on Monday that it planned to build a $3.5 billion electric-vehicle battery factory in Michigan using technology licensed from a Chinese company that has become one of the most important players in the auto industry.
The plant, to be built in Marshall, a rural town about 100 miles west of Detroit, will be the latest in a growing list of new battery and electric-car factories that companies have announced in recent months. Ford expects to employ about 2,500 people at the plant and begin production in 2026.
The automaker said it would own 100% of the plant and make battery cells using technology and services from Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd., known as CATL. The company, the world’s largest producer of batteries for electric vehicles, has 13 factories of its own in Europe and Asia but none in the United States.
Just a quarter-century ago, Chinese officials were eagerly asking U.S. automakers to bring their investments and expertise to China. Today, the roles are reversed, with one of America’s most storied industrial giants asking China for the technology needed to survive in a rapidly changing global automotive landscape.
“This will help us build more EVs faster,” William Clay Ford Jr., the company’s executive chairman, said Monday. He added that CATL would “help us get up to speed so we can build the batteries ourselves.”
The alliance comes at a time of considerable tension between Washington and Beijing, after the United States shot down a Chinese surveillance balloon off the coast of South Carolina on Feb. 4. Secretary of State Antony Blinken abruptly canceled a trip to Beijing after the spy balloon was sighted above Montana.
Two more unidentified objects were shot down late last week, one over northernmost Alaska and another over northern Canada. A fourth unidentified object was shot down on Sunday over Lake Huron, off the eastern shore of Michigan.
China on Monday accused the United States of having sent high-altitude balloons through its airspace without permission more than 10 times since the start of last year.
The balloon dispute appeared to have interrupted efforts by China to attract more foreign investment after it ended nearly three years of “zero COVID” policies and began to reopen its borders. Many politicians in the United States remain wary of China and of Chinese investment.
Gov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia, a Republican, last month withdrew his state’s bid for Ford’s venture with CATL. He described the planned project to Bloomberg Television on Jan. 20 as a “Trojan horse” for the Communist Party of China.
Ford is seeking to insulate itself from U.S.-China tensions by opting to own the factory entirely and only licensing technology from CATL, which supplies batteries to Tesla, BMW and other large automakers.
The company said its contract with CATL includes provisions to work through difficulties that arise between the two countries. “Of course we’ve thought about it,” Lisa Drake, Ford’s vice president of EV industrialization, said in a conference call with reporters, without disclosing further details.
Ford, General Motors and other automakers are building other battery plants that are jointly owned with South Korean partners. Ford is building two battery plants in Kentucky and a third in Tennessee, both with SK On. GM recently started production at a battery plant in Ohio that it jointly owns with LG Energy Solution, and the partners are building two more plants, in Tennessee and Michigan.
Ford’s new plant will produce batteries that include lithium, iron and phosphate, a combination known as LFP. These batteries are less expensive because they do not include expensive ingredients such as cobalt and nickel used in other batteries. LFP batteries also have the advantage of being more durable. But batteries that contain cobalt and nickel hold more energy, allowing electric vehicles to go farther before needing to be charged.
“The whole point of this project is to lower the cost of EVs,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said. “LFP is the most affordable battery technology.”
Ford had looked at building the factory in Canada and Mexico but chose a U.S. site after the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law last year by President Joe Biden. The act provided tax incentives to companies that build battery factories in the United States. Car buyers are also eligible for tax credits for electric vehicles made in North America that include batteries and raw materials from the region or another U.S. trade ally.
“This is the reason the IRA was passed,” Farley said, referring to the Marshall plant.
Ford’s decision is also a big victory for Michigan. Over the past two years, automakers have chosen Southern states for more than a half-dozen auto plants.
Ford said its plant would be able to produce enough batteries for 400,000 electric vehicles a year. The company plans to use the LFP batteries in its Mustang Mach-E, a sport-utility vehicle, and the F-150 Lightning, a pickup truck, and other electric vehicles. CATL will supply Ford with LFP cells until the Marshall plant begins production.
All automakers are trying to produce more electric vehicles, sales of which jumped 66% last year in the United States. Ford is the second-largest seller of EVs in the U.S. after Tesla.
Ford said vehicles with LFP batteries were better suited for commuting and local driving and could be charged up to 100% capacity quickly. Batteries with cobalt and nickel are better for long-range driving or towing, but generally take longer to charge.
CATL has 100,000 employees around the world, mostly in China, and has been the world’s largest supplier of electric car batteries for the past six years. One-third of the electric cars now on the road around the world use CATL batteries.
The company is little known outside the auto industry. Robin Zeng, founder and CEO of CATL, set up the company in 2011 in his hometown, a previously impoverished area of fishing villages and rice paddies on the northern outskirts of Ningde, a town about halfway between Shanghai and Hong Kong.
CATL has hired thousands of engineers at low cost in a country that heavily emphasizes math and science education. The battery industry’s transformation of Ningde has echoed the boom that Detroit and Midwest experienced during the U.S. car industry’s heyday.
CATL has one-third of its workforce in Ningde, including many of its blue-collar workers. Rows of high-rise apartments have been built, holding down real estate prices to one-tenth of those in cities such as Beijing or Shanghai.
China almost completely closed its borders for nearly three years during the pandemic, preventing practically all foreigners from entering the country and limiting the ability of Chinese nationals to leave. CATL nonetheless negotiated global deals during this time, and began producing lithium-ion battery cells in December at a factory in Germany.
CATL also recently opened an office in Detroit to promote its batteries. A huge map of CATL’s worldwide operations on the wall of a lobby museum at its headquarters has a recently added dot for the Detroit office — except that the dot had been mistakenly placed in what appeared to be southwestern Wisconsin.
The process of making a lithium iron phosphate battery such as the ones that Ford will be using could be seen Sunday during a rare visit inside a cavernous CATL factory in Ningde.
The process starts with rolls of metal foil a tenth of the thickness of human hair. Aluminum foil is coated with an extremely thin layer of lithium, iron and phosphate, while copper foil is coated with an extremely thin layer of graphite. Large spools of the two kinds of foil, along with a third spool of very thin separators, are used to wind alternating layers together to make the core of each battery cell. The core is then clamped tightly together in a gray machine the size of a city bus.
A bright orange, 10-foot-tall robot, like the ones used in car assembly plant welding lines, picks up rows of battery cores and puts them into a cold press for compression. The cores then go through a kiln that heats them to 105 degrees Celsius (221 degrees Fahrenheit) to steam away any trace of water. The 300-yard-long hall in which the batteries are made is kept much drier than even the Sahara.
After baking, liquid electrolyte — lithium salts with a solvent — is injected twice into each battery as an electrolyte. The batteries are then tightly sealed for delivery to customers. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Can the N.F.L.'s Team Ownership Rules Survive Huge Valuations?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Other sports leagues have changed their rules to allow private equity firms to invest. But so far, the N.F.L. has resisted.
If you watch the Super Bowl on Sunday, you will probably watch it live. That's becoming increasingly rare in today's era of cord cutting, and it's one of the reasons valuations of football teams -- along with those in nearly every other sport -- have skyrocketed. With teams no longer viewed as merely trophies, the money has flowed in from investors who are rushing to own a piece of the action.
As valuations rise, more potential team buyers are being priced out. Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League have responded by changing their rules to allow private equity firms to invest. (The N.B.A. now allows sovereign wealth money, too.) The question on every sports insider's mind is when -- and if -- the National Football League will follow.
Football teams are the "Rolls-Royce of American sports leagues," said Salvatore Galatioto, whose company has advised investors on buying and selling professional sports franchises. They bring in the most money, and they have, on average, the highest valuations -- which are quickly growing, as sale prices over the past decade make clear:
Buffalo Bills (2014): $ 1.4 billion.
Carolina Panthers (2018): $ 2.22 billion.
Denver Broncos (2022): $ 4.65 billion.
The N.F.L. requires that an incoming general partner buy at least a 30 percent stake in the team. It also limits the amount of debt a buyer can use to finance the deal to $ 1 billion. That means the Washington Commanders, which hired Bank of America late last year to explore a sale, would need a buyer with about $ 1 billion in cash to match the Broncos' valuation in 2022. Given the team's popularity, and because Washington is a bigger market than Denver, any deal would very likely value the team much higher than that.
But N.F.L. owners aren't flinging open the doors. Many have passed ownership down from generation to generation. It's a close-knit bunch, and one that could be shaken by allowing institutional investors into its ownership group. "When you bring in sort of more anonymous entities, or at least ones that have larger swaths of decision makers, you create some reduction in that feel that this is an exclusive club," said Alex Michael, a managing director at LionTree. Ryan Nece, a former N.F.L. linebacker and co-founder of Next Play Capital, told DealBook that, "given my conversations with N.F.L. team owners, it doesn't appear to be something they are considering embracing today."
Closed ownership affects more than deal flow. The lack of diversity among owners, who are overwhelmingly white, has been cited as one reason for the N.F.L.'s slowness in diversifying its ranks. "Owners still look a certain way,," Richard Sherman told The New York Times in 2020 when he was a cornerback for the San Francisco 49ers. "They still come from a very old background." On the N.F.L.'s diversity issues, he said: "They could not care less."
Private equity, of course, has its own challenges with diversity, but new investors could expand the options. The N.F.L., for its part, passed a resolution in 2022 to increase diversity among its ownership. In August, three Black investors took minority stakes in the sale of the Broncos to the Walton-Penner ownership group.
There's likely only one thing that will change the N.F.L.'s mind, say investors active in sports deal making. Gerry Cardinale, the founder of RedBird Capital Partners, put it like this: "If they have to have an auction for a team, or a sale process for a team, and a Jeff Bezos or a David Tepper or a Rob Walton doesn't show up, I think they're going to have to start to look at that."
HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
Americans are expected to bet $ 16 billion on the game, according to the American Gaming Association. That number is in legal and illegal bets and is more than twice the value of last year's estimated wagers. It's the first time the Super Bowl will be played in a state that has legalized sports betting.
Anheuser-Busch won't be the only alcohol brand running national commercials for the first time since 1989. The parent company of Budweiser and Stella Artois still plans to air three minutes of national ads, but its competitors will also be allowed to join in Another longtime sponsorship ending this year? The halftime show, which has been sponsored by PepsiCo since 2013, is now backed by Apple Music, which signed a $ 250 million five-year deal.
Rihanna returns from a nearly four-year hiatus from live performances. The halftime show will be a high-stakes comeback for the pop star, who has been busy building three companies that helped make her the youngest self-made billionaire, according to Forbes. Her company Savage X Fenty has sold out of special edition T-shirts reading, "Rihanna Concert Interrupted by a Football Game, Weird but Whatever."
Two Black quarterbacks face off in the Super Bowl for the first time. Jalen Hurts and Patrick Mahomes, the starting quarterbacks of the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs, have both called the milestone "historic."
The pregame
For most of America, the Super Bowl starts on Sunday evening. But for the deal makers who use the event as a backdrop for doing business, the real game starts days before kickoff.
It's not uncommon to attend exclusive dinners and parties during the week, and then jet out of town before the opening kickoff. "Once the game starts, it's just a game," said George Foster, a professor at Stanford Business School who directs the school's sports management initiative. "It's much more effective to get extended time fairly focused on the business relationship on Thursday, Friday and Saturday."
Michael Rubin, the founder of the sports merchandising company Fanatics, hosted a business lunch on Friday along with the sports agent Casey Wasserman. He said about 10 of the 100 guests, who included three state governors and about half of the N.F.L.'s team owners, flew to Phoenix just for that event. "That gives you a sense of how important it was," he said. "People fly in and out just for an event."
Deal makers take advantage of having big players in one place. "There's C.E.O.-to-C.E.O. contact, which is unique in sports," said George Pyne, the founder of Bruin Capital, a sports investment company, who has hosted a party with the agent Sandy Montag before each of the past 15 Super Bowls. "The N.B.A. Finals, you never know where and when it is, so you can't go to that. Same with the N.H.L. Same with the World Series. There's no other event that galvanizes sports business leaders in a way that the Super Bowl does."
Rubin, who in addition to Friday's lunch is hosting an 800-person, invite-only party Saturday night headlined by the Chainsmokers, said his deal to sell an online services company that he founded to eBay for $ 2.4 billion in 2011 largely came together during the days before a Super Bowl game. Fanatics, he says, has also done major deals with the N.F.L. at the game. "We've done billions of dollars of business at the Super Bowl over the years," he said.
The pregame is growing. "The Super Bowl used to be a one-day event," Foster said. "Now, it's a week to two-week-long event." Even so, luxury tickets to the actual game are still in demand. Stadium suites that can accommodate 18 to 26 people for this year's game begain selling for $ 700,000 to $ 1 million, according to Suite Experiences, which allows companies with long-term suite leases to rent out their luxury boxes on the platform. "They want to watch the game for sure," Pyne said, referring to deal makers, "but they're there to conduct business."
A $ 1 billion Super Bowl?
Another Super Bowl, another record.
According to Fox, the broadcaster for Super Bowl LVII, a bidding war has pushed up the price for the game's most coveted 30-second ad slots to more than $ 7 million -- further proof that a lousy economy and a steep downturn in ad spending is no match for the big game's appeal.
Fox has raked in about $ 600 million in advertising revenue from the Super Bowl -- yep, a record -- as brands aim to reach what is likely to be the biggest TV audience of the year: an expected 100 million viewers (not a Super Bowl record). Over the past five years, the price of ads has spiked up and up, all but guaranteeing the exclusive broadcaster a lucrative payday at a time when media giants are laying off staff and cutting back on programming.
Question: How close are we to the first billion-dollar Super Bowl?
Answer: Probably 2027, according to the Kantar Group, a brand consulting and media analytics firm, which says that broadcast revenues for the event have been rising by $ 100 million each year.
Many viewers could care less about the Eagles or the Chiefs. Or the Rihanna halftime show. They want to see the buzzy ad creations that will liven up the roughly four-hour broadcast. In the YouTube era, advertisers now put the best spots online early. Here are some of DealBook's favorites:
Pop Corners. The snack food brand has reunited the Breaking Bad characters Jesse Pinkman, Walter White and Tuco in a desert standoff. What could go wrong? Crunch.
Busch Beer. OK, this one is just weird. The Canadian singer Sarah McLachlan makes a cameo with what appears to be a wolf, and other woodland creatures.
Michelob Ultra. Yes, another beer ad. Like so many Super Bowl ads this year, this one plays on our nostalgic side; it riffs on "Caddyshack." It features Serena Williams teeing off against Brian Cox of "Succession" fame. Stay for the final putt.
Sex work, sex trafficking and the Super Bowl
In December, Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, like many government officials preparing to host the Super Bowl before him, announced a statewide campaign to raise awareness of human trafficking, including sex trafficking, ahead of the big game. Though the claim that increased sex trafficking and sex work occurs during major sporting events like the Super Bowl has been debunked over and over and over and over and over again, anti-human trafficking campaigns often target these events.
Campaigns by cities have been criticized by advocates for sex workers, who say such efforts often rely on law enforcement "raids." More patrolling can lead to more arrests of sex workers who are not being trafficked, they say, as well as the possibility that victims of trafficking will be arrested.
It's also unclear whether campaigns to raise awareness about sex trafficking are effective at addressing it. "If we want to protect people who are being trafficked, we need to protect sex workers because they are the most vulnerable for that happening to them next," Kristen DiAngelo, executive director of the Sex Workers Outreach Project in Sacramento, told The Washington Post ahead of last year's Super Bowl.

Electric Vehicles Could Match Gasoline Cars on Price This Year

More quickly than seemed possible a few months ago, sticker prices for electric vehicles are falling closer to the point at which they could soon be on a par with gasoline cars.
Increased competition, government incentives and falling prices for lithium and other battery materials are making electric vehicles noticeably more affordable. The tipping point when electric vehicles become as cheap or cheaper than cars with internal combustion engines could arrive this year for some mass market models and is already the case for some luxury vehicles.
Prices are likely to continue trending lower as Tesla, General Motors, Ford Motor and their battery suppliers ramp up new factories, reaping the cost savings that come from mass production. New electric vehicles from companies like Volkswagen, Nissan and Hyundai will add to competitive pressure.
The battery-powered version of GM’s Equinox crossover, for example, will start around $30,000 when it arrives this fall, the carmaker has said. That is $3,400 more than the least expensive gasoline-fueled Equinox. But factoring in government incentives, the electric Equinox should be cheaper. Like all electric vehicles, the car will need less maintenance, and the electricity to power it will cost less than the gasoline used by its combustion engine equivalent.
Only a few months ago, electric-vehicle buyers faced long waiting lists, and dealers marked up sticker prices by thousands of dollars. Used electric vehicles sometimes sold for more than new ones because buyers were willing to pay a premium to get one right away. At the end of 2022, the average price of an electric vehicle was $61,488, compared with $49,507 for all passenger cars and trucks, according to Kelley Blue Book.
There are still waiting lists for some models like the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck, but it has become easier and cheaper to find and buy new and used electric models.
The first major crack in the trend of rising prices came in January, when Tesla cut prices for the Model 3 and Model Y, the two bestselling electric cars, by thousands of dollars. With a starting price of $43,500 before government incentives, a Model 3 is now $300 less than the least expensive BMW 3 Series sedan. A Model Y, at $55,000 before tax credits, costs about as much as a comparable Lexus RX.
Ford also cut the price of its Mustang Mach-E, the bestselling electric vehicle in the United States after the Teslas. Even Lucid Motors, a maker of expensive electric sedans that do not qualify for tax credits, is feeling pressure to cut prices and this week began offering $7,500 discounts on cars that start at $107,400.
Tesla “saw there is increasing competition, and some of the competition is quite good,” said Brian Moody, executive editor for Kelley Blue Book. He added, “If the No. 1 seller of a certain type of car reduces their prices, that is going to have an impact on the average.”
Major impetus for the price cuts came from the Inflation Reduction Act, legislation passed by Democrats in Congress last year that provides tax credits of up to $7,500 for electric-car buyers. To qualify, battery-powered or plug-in hybrid sedans have to sell for less than $55,000, while pickups and sport utility vehicles qualify only if the retail price is below $80,000. By cutting prices, Ford and Tesla increased the number of models that could benefit from the tax credits.
Manufacturers “are working to continue to pull in shoppers by making these vehicles eligible for tax credits,” said Jenni Newman, editor-in-chief of Cars.com, an online auto-sales site.
Potentially more significant are subsidies paid to companies that manufacture batteries in the United States, part of a drive by the Biden administration to establish a domestic supply chain and reduce dependence on China.
The subsidies, which were also part of the Inflation Reduction Act, could cut the cost of making electric vehicles by as much as $9,000. That break and the tax credits for buyers of electric cars could allow battery-powered vehicles to achieve price parity with gasoline cars as soon as this year, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research and advocacy group. That is three to five years sooner than would be the case without incentives.
“If the automakers pass that on to consumers, consumers will really benefit,” said Stephanie Searle, a program director at the council who oversees research on passenger vehicles.
Declines in new-car prices are pushing down used electric-vehicle prices, too. They have fallen 17% since July, according to Recurrent, which tracks the used-car market. That’s largely because of Tesla cutting the price of the Model 3 and GM lowering the price of the Chevrolet Bolt by almost $6,000 last year. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, used cars can also qualify for a tax credit of up to $4,000. That is important because most people buy used vehicles.
Falling prices for materials like lithium and cobalt have also helped. The price of lithium used in batteries has fallen 20% from its peak in November, though the metal still costs more than twice as much as it did at the end of 2021. Cobalt has fallen by more than half since May, in part because carmakers are selling some models that do not require it, reducing demand.
New lithium mines are beginning to produce ore, which could keep a lid on prices. Sigma Lithium will begin shipping raw material from a site in Brazil to LG Energy Solution, its main customer, as early as April, Ana Cabral Gardner, Sigma Lithium’s chief executive, said in an interview. The site will be the first new source of lithium in Latin America for several years. “It’s doable, and we’re there,” Cabral Gardner said.
Of course, these advantages could fade because of new supply-chain problems. Lithium remains in short supply, and prices could spike again. Beginning next month, new regulations governing the $7,500 tax credits will require electric-car batteries to be made in the United States, Canada or Mexico with raw materials from North America or another U.S. trade ally. It is unclear how many vehicles will meet those requirements.
Right now, the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits are available to vehicles assembled in North America, which partially shields the U.S. automakers from competitors like Hyundai. The company’s Ioniq 5 has sold well, but it is imported from South Korea. Hyundai is building a factory in Georgia that will start assembling electric vehicles in 2025. (Buyers may still collect a tax credit indirectly if they lease foreign-made electric vehicles.)
The Treasury Department, which is responsible for carrying out the Inflation Reduction Act, gave in to auto industry lobbying this month and classified several popular crossovers as SUVs rather than sedans. That allows vehicles like the Mustang Mach-E and all versions of the Model Y to qualify for tax credits if they sell for $80,000 or less. Before that change, the Mustang and lighter versions of the Model Y were classified as sedans, subject to a $55,000 limit.
The decision removes some pressure on the carmakers to keep prices low. Tesla quickly raised the price of the Model Y by $2,000. Ford said it has no plans to raise prices of the Mach-E.
The Inflation Reduction Act is also under attack by many congressional Republicans even though automakers and battery companies are building factories in states like South Carolina, Texas and Tennessee, where voters tend to elect Republicans.
But arguably the most powerful force driving down prices is not the commodity markets or Washington.
As electric-vehicle sales soar — rising 66% in the United States last year to 810,000, according to Kelley Blue Book — automakers are getting better at making them. Ford has reduced the weight of the Mach-E by 70 pounds, increasing range and lowering cost, by eliminating some wiring, Jim Farley, the company’s chief executive, told investors this month.
GM and LG Energy Solution began producing batteries at a new plant in Ohio last year through a joint venture, Ultium Cells. A second Ultium plant, in Tennessee, is expected to begin production this year, and a third is slated for Michigan. Generally speaking, costs come down as companies produce more of a product.
Auto executives say that they are finding it is easier and cheaper to design and build new electric models than gasoline-powered ones.
The battery cells made by Ultium, for example, are part of a collection of components that can be mixed and matched in many types of vehicles. Carmakers have long used the same platforms in multiple models, but the strategy works even better with electric vehicles because the cars have far fewer parts than internal combustion vehicles.
The Ultium platform cuts the time needed to develop a new vehicle by almost two years, Dan Nicholson, vice president of electrification at GM, said at a Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago conference in January.
As a result, GM will be able to introduce three Chevrolet electric vehicles this year: the Equinox, a Silverado pickup truck and a Blazer SUV. “That’s how we get the economies of scale,” Nicholson said.
Suppliers have been looking for efficiencies, too. Matthews International Corp., based in Pittsburgh, has developed a process for coating the metal foil that separates the positive and negative electrodes of a battery. Instead of a liquid solution, the process uses a powder.
The process requires less equipment and a lot less space, said Greg Babe, the company’s chief technology officer. Those kinds of incremental improvements reduce costs without major technical breakthroughs.
Interest in the approach developed by Matthews has soared since Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act. “It changed almost overnight,” Babe said. “The floodgates opened.”

SALINAS VICTORIA, Mexico — Bill Chan had never set foot anywhere in Mexico, let alone the lonely stretch of desert in the north of the country where he abruptly decided to build a $300 million factory. But that seemed a trifling detail amid the pressure to adapt to a swiftly changing global economy.
It was January 2022, and Chan’s company, Man Wah Furniture Manufacturing, was confronting grave challenges in moving sofas from its factories in China to customers in the United States. Shipping prices were skyrocketing. Washington and Beijing were locked in a fierce trade war.
Man Wah, one of China’s largest furniture companies, was eager to make its products on the North American side of the Pacific.
“Our main market is the United States,” said Chan, CEO of Man Wah’s Mexico subsidiary. “We don’t want to lose that market.”
That same objective explains why scores of major Chinese companies are investing aggressively in Mexico, taking advantage of an expansive North American trade deal. Tracing a path forged by Japanese and South Korean companies, Chinese firms are establishing factories that allow them to label their goods “Made in Mexico,” then trucking their products into the United States duty-free.
The interest of Chinese manufacturers in Mexico is part of a broader trend known as nearshoring. International companies are moving production closer to customers to limit their vulnerability to shipping problems and geopolitical tensions.
The participation of Chinese companies in this shift attests to the deepening assumption that the breach dividing the United States and China will be an enduring feature of the next phase of globalization. Yet it also reveals something more fundamental: Whatever the political strains, the commercial forces linking the United States and China are even more powerful.
Chinese companies have no intention of forsaking the American economy, still the largest on Earth. Instead, they are setting up operations inside the North American trading bloc as a way to supply Americans with goods, from electronics to clothing to furniture.
The Mexican border state of Nuevo León has positioned itself to reap the bounty. Led by a brash, 35-year-old governor, Samuel García, the state has courted foreign investment while pursuing highway improvements to ease the passage to border crossings.
García recently attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to recruit more companies.
“Nuevo León is having a geopolitical planetary alignment,” the governor declared during an interview in the state capital of Monterrey, inside the government palace, a warren of grand rooms with high ceilings and balconies looking out to the jagged peaks of the Sierra Madre. “We’re receiving lots of Asians that want to come to the U.S. market.”
Since García took office in October 2021, nearly $7 billion in foreign investment has poured into Nuevo León, making the state the largest recipient after Mexico City, according to the Mexican Ministry of Economy.
In 2021, Chinese companies were responsible for 30% of foreign investment in Nuevo León, second only to the United States at 47%.
Some of this money is financing factories that will make finished products for sale in the United States. But much is focused on a broader refashioning of the global supply chain.
As the pandemic disrupted Chinese industry and jammed ports, companies with factories in the United States suffered shortages of parts made in Asia. Many are now demanding that their suppliers set up plants in North America or risk losing their business.
Lizhong, a Chinese manufacturer of automobile wheels, is erecting the company’s first factory outside Asia at an industrial park in Nuevo León. Lizhong’s largest customers, including Ford and General Motors, pressed the company to open a factory in North America, said its general manager for Mexico, Wang Bing.
A South Korean company, DY Power, which makes components for construction equipment, is considering northern Mexico as the site for a factory near a major customer in Texas.
“After going through the pandemic and the supply chain crisis, the China COVID shutdown, many North American manufacturers would like to eliminate the risk,” said Sean Seo, a Seattle-based executive for DY Power.
“Globalization has ended,” he declared. “It’s localization now.”
César Santos has placed a substantial bet on such pronouncements proving true.
A corporate lawyer, Santos, 65, runs a sideline enterprise as a developer in Monterrey, an industrial boomtown full of upscale restaurants, glittering shopping malls and spas.
A decade ago, he was approached by a developer in Los Angeles who was representing a Chinese electronics company that was contemplating a factory in Mexico. Santos controlled an asset of considerable interest — a 2,100-acre parcel of land.
Dotted by cactus, the property sat less than 150 miles from the Texas border. While surrounding states grappled with violence linked to drug trafficking, Nuevo León carried a reputation for security. The state boasted a highly skilled workforce, given the presence of universities that churned out engineering graduates, among them Tec de Monterrey, often referred to as “Mexico’s MIT.”
The land had been his family’s cattle ranch when Santos was a child, the scene of horseback riding adventures. Now, he saw a lucrative opportunity to turn it into an industrial park.
He took a trip to China, riding a high-speed train from Shanghai to the lakefront city of Hangzhou to meet the Holley Group, which had constructed an industrial park for Chinese companies in Thailand.
“China was a country that had developed everything so fast,” Santos said. “I was really amazed.”
By 2015, he had joined with Holley and another Chinese partner to forge a joint venture, Hofusan Real Estate. They plan a grid of warehouses and factories fronted by a hotel and temporary apartments for visiting managers, plus more than 12,000 homes for workers.
The Holley Group dispatched Jiang Xin to oversee the venture. He had previously worked at the company’s project in Thailand. Mexico presented a different proposition.
“Chinese companies had no idea about Mexico, and the only things we knew were bad things, dangerous things,” Jiang said. “Then Trump came.”
When he became president in 2017, Donald Trump demanded that American companies abandon China. By 2018, he was slapping steep tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in Chinese imports.
“The tariff thing did help us,” Jiang said. “Chinese companies wanted more options. And we are one of their options.”
By the time Chan began contemplating Mexico in the fall of 2021, 27 other Chinese companies had already locked up land inside the Hofusan park. Only one large parcel remained.
Man Wah had already responded to the tariffs by building a factory in Vietnam, and using it to make products for the American market. But the soaring price of shipping beggared that strategy.
Man Wah was moving 3,500 40-foot shipping containers a month across the Pacific from Vietnam. Voyages that previously cost $2,000 were suddenly 10 times as much.
Chan used the Chinese social media platform, WeChat, to connect with Jiang. His questions were blunt. How soon could Man Wah begin construction? (Immediately.) How were the highways? (Not great, but improving.) Were there any authentic Chinese restaurants in the vicinity? (No.)
Within weeks, Man Wah had committed to purchase the land. In January 2022, Chan signed the contract before boarding a flight to Mexico, leaving his wife and two children behind in Shenzhen.
While the new factory is being constructed, Man Wah has already begun producing sofas at a small, leased plant nearby.
Even before he located the temporary site, Chan loaded 70 containers full of machinery and raw materials in China, putting them on a ship bound for Mexico.
“We always do things quickly,” he said. “Don’t worry about anything, just do it.”
Man Wah does worry about a few things: hiring enough workers and cultivating local suppliers.
The company has plans to manufacture nearly 900,000 pieces of furniture per year in Mexico. That will require hiring and retaining 6,000 workers.
Man Wah is accustomed to operating in China and Vietnam, where independent labor unions are essentially banned, and where rural people stream into industrial areas in pursuit of jobs.
In Nuevo León, the unemployment rate is 3.6%. The surge of investment has set off a fierce competition for workers.
Savvy companies have wooed their employees with extras like quality meals and transportation to work. But Man Wah and other Chinese companies answer to bosses in China, who are conditioned toward thrift while thinking of workers as easily replaceable.
Finding local suppliers is also a challenge. Under the terms of the North American trade agreement, manufacturers must employ minimum percentages of parts and raw materials from within the region to qualify for duty-free access to the other countries in the bloc.
Three years ago, Lenovo, the Chinese computer maker, opened a new factory in Monterrey dedicated to making servers, the boxes that hold data for cloud computing.
Until last year, Lenovo flew in one crucial component — so-called motherboards — from a factory in China. But as international shipping troubles intensified, the company switched to a supplier in the Mexican city of Guadalajara.
Lenovo also stopped importing packaging materials from China, instead buying them in Mexico.
But Lenovo continues to import many key components from China, from memory devices to specialized cables.
“There’s no supply chain for these things in Mexico,” said Leandro Sardela, the company’s western operations director.

President Concedes Nothing in Push for Big Economic Programs: [News Analysis]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In his first appearance before a Republican House, the president renewed calls for large new economic programs and offered no concessions on federal spending.
WASHINGTON -- There were no economic pivots in President Biden's first State of the Union address to a Republican House. He did not pare back his push to raise taxes on high earners or to spend big on new government programs. He offered no olive branches to conservatives who have accused him of running the country into crisis with government borrowing.
It was a shift from Mr. Biden's two most recent Democratic predecessors in the White House, who tacked toward a more conciliatory and limited-government approach to economic policy after losing at least one chamber of Congress. But on Tuesday night, Mr. Biden barreled ahead.
The president renewed his calls for trillions of dollars of new federal programs, including for child care and community college, over the sometimes raucous objections of Republicans who have centered their fight with Mr. Biden on the issue of spending and debt. He did not name a single federal spending program he was willing to cut. He said he would work to reduce budget deficits, but by raising taxes on high earners and corporations, a position anathema to Republicans.
The speech was not a blueprint to pass any of those proposals, which have little chance of becoming law during his first term.
Instead, it was a defiant opening bid for a high-stakes clash over raising the nation's borrowing limit. It was a no-quarter recommitment to a campaign theme aimed squarely at blue-collar voters in 2024 swing states, centered on expanding government in pursuit of what Mr. Biden calls "middle-out" economic policy.
Aides say the choice to defy Republicans' calls for Mr. Biden to change course on economic policy was deliberate, reflecting both the president's deeply held convictions on policy and his belief that he has found a winning political message.
It was also a bet that the economy, which has so far been a drag on Mr. Biden's popularity, will ultimately prove to be a tailwind in his widely expected re-election campaign. Rapid price gains are beginning to ease, and jobs are plentiful, with the unemployment rate at its lowest point since 1969.
To that end, Mr. Biden spent much of the speech proclaiming that the American economy is faring better on his watch than his critics -- or even many of his voters -- concede. He dived into details about laws he has signed to invest in water pipes, semiconductor factories, electric vehicles and more, while promising those plans would bring high-paying jobs to workers without college degrees. He promised consumer-friendly crackdowns on credit card fees, social media companies and more. On Wednesday, Mr. Biden was headed to Wisconsin to promote his economic legislation, while his cabinet secretaries fanned out across the country to do the same.
"We're building an economy where no one's left behind," Mr. Biden said in his speech. "Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back, because choices we made in the last several years. You know, this is, in my view, a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives at home."
"Here's my message to all of you out there," he added later. "I have your back."
Mr. Biden's approach underscored how he has not regarded the Republican House takeover as a rebuke of his policies.
It defied the example set by Mr. Biden's Democratic predecessors after they lost House control in their first midterms. President Bill Clinton promised a new era of smaller government in 1995. President Barack Obama vowed in 2011 "to take responsibility for our deficit" and proposed what he called "painful cuts" to domestic spending.
Mr. Biden offered no apology for his policies. He cast himself as more fiscally responsible than his immediate predecessor, former President Donald J. Trump, in claiming credit for a $ 1.7 trillion decline in the federal budget deficit last year. That improvement was largely the product of expiring pandemic aid programs, but Mr. Biden suggested he would take steps to keep winnowing the shortfall between what the government spent and what it earned through taxes and other revenue. He said his next budget, which will be released on March 9, would further reduce deficits by $ 2 trillion over a decade.
In a sharp contrast with Republicans, he called for raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy as a way to show a commitment to deficit reduction in spite of his spending plans. His proposals included an expanded tax on stock buybacks and what would effectively be a sort of wealth tax on billionaires.
He baited Republicans on a pair of politically cherished programs, Social Security and Medicare, drawing sustained jeers when he said some of his opponents wanted to sunset the programs. While hundreds of Republican lawmakers have signed on to plans to reduce spending on the safety net by raising retirement ages and other reductions in future benefits, Mr. Biden's "sunset" accusation rests on the possible effects of a plan to reauthorize spending programs every five years, advanced by Senator Rick Scott of Florida, which has gained little traction among party leaders.
Republicans called the speech a departure from Mr. Biden's previous calls for unity and a disconnect on major economic issues.
"While the president is busy taking a premature and undeserved victory lap, lauding legislation that Democrats passed on a party-line basis, families in West Virginia and America are struggling at every turn because many of the policies and priorities of this administration have made the American dream harder to attain," Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, said in a release after the address.
Mr. Biden's allies cheered. The president "delivered a bold blueprint for an economy that, at long last, puts working people first," Liz Shuler, the president of the powerful A.F.L.-C.I.O. labor organization, said in a news release on Tuesday evening.
Mr. Biden fashions himself a congressional deal maker, and on Tuesday, he outlined a handful of smaller-scale initiatives on other issues, like curbing the flow of fentanyl and regulating big tech, that might plausibly win bipartisan support in the new Congress. But the speech was not a recipe for economic compromise.
The president re-upped calls for big new federal investments in child care and assistance for the elderly, community college, prekindergarten and health insurance. But he offered no plausible road to finishing the job, as he put it, on that long list of proposals, which he was unable to include in the wide array of economic legislation he signed in his first two years because of opposition from centrist Democrats in the Senate.
What he did outline was a defiant negotiating posture, as he and Republican lawmakers battle over raising the $ 31.4 trillion federal borrowing limit, which the United States hit last month. That cap, which limits the government's ability to borrow funds to pay for spending that Congress has already authorized, must be suspended or lifted later this year in order for the United States to continue paying its bills and avoid a financial crisis.
Republicans are refusing to raise the limit unless Mr. Biden agrees to deep spending cuts. Mr. Biden has said he will refuse to bargain over the borrowing cap and on Tuesday night reminded Republicans that they had agreed to effectively increase the debt limit three times when Mr. Trump was president. Despite what both sides called a productive meeting at the White House last week between the president and Speaker Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, Mr. Biden did not waver in that position on Tuesday.
"We're not going to be moved into being threatened to default on the debt," Mr. Biden said.
Mr. McCarthy, seated behind him, did not look pleased.

WASHINGTON — There were no economic pivots in President Joe Biden’s first State of the Union address to a Republican House. He did not pare back his push to raise taxes on high earners or to spend big on new government programs. He offered no olive branches to conservatives who have accused him of running the country into crisis with government borrowing.
It was a shift from Biden’s two most recent Democratic predecessors in the White House, who tacked toward a more conciliatory and limited-government approach to economic policy after losing at least one chamber of Congress. But on Tuesday night, Biden barreled ahead.
The president renewed his calls for trillions of dollars of new federal programs, including for child care and community college, over the sometimes raucous objections of Republicans who have centered their fight with Biden on the issue of spending and debt. He did not name a single federal spending program he was willing to cut. He said he would work to reduce budget deficits, but by raising taxes on high earners and corporations, a position anathema to Republicans.
The speech was not a blueprint to pass any of those proposals, which have little chance of becoming law during his first term.
Instead, it was a defiant opening bid for a high-stakes clash over raising the nation’s borrowing limit. It was a no-quarter recommitment to a campaign theme aimed squarely at blue-collar voters in 2024 swing states, centered on expanding government in pursuit of what Biden calls “middle-out” economic policy.
Aides say the choice to defy Republicans’ calls for Biden to change course on economic policy was deliberate, reflecting both the president’s deeply held convictions on policy and his belief that he has found a winning political message.
It was also a bet that the economy, which has so far been a drag on Biden’s popularity, will ultimately prove to be a tail wind in his widely expected reelection campaign. Rapid price gains are beginning to ease, and jobs are plentiful, with the unemployment rate at its lowest point since 1969.
To that end, Biden spent much of the speech proclaiming that the U.S. economy is faring better on his watch than his critics — or even many of his voters — concede. He dived into details about laws he has signed to invest in water pipes, semiconductor factories, electric vehicles and more, while promising those plans would bring high-paying jobs to workers without college degrees. He promised consumer-friendly crackdowns on credit card fees, social media companies and more. On Wednesday, Biden was headed to Wisconsin to promote his economic legislation, while his Cabinet secretaries fanned out across the country to do the same.
“We’re building an economy where no one’s left behind,” Biden said in his speech. “Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back, because choices we made in the last several years. You know, this is, in my view, a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives at home.
“Here’s my message to all of you out there,” he added later. “I have your back.”
Biden’s approach underscored how he has not regarded the Republican House takeover as a rebuke of his policies.
It defied the example set by Biden’s Democratic predecessors after they lost House control in their first midterms. President Bill Clinton promised a new era of smaller government in 1995. President Barack Obama vowed in 2011 “to take responsibility for our deficit” and proposed what he called “painful cuts” to domestic spending.
Biden offered no apology for his policies. He cast himself as more fiscally responsible than his immediate predecessor, former President Donald Trump, in claiming credit for a $1.7 trillion decline in the federal budget deficit last year. That improvement was largely the product of expiring pandemic aid programs, but Biden suggested he would take steps to keep winnowing the shortfall between what the government spends and what it earns through taxes and other revenue. He said his next budget, which will be released March 9, would further reduce deficits by $2 trillion over a decade.
In a sharp contrast with Republicans, he called for raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy as a way to show a commitment to deficit reduction despite his spending plans. His proposals included an expanded tax on stock buybacks and what would effectively be a sort of wealth tax on billionaires.
He baited Republicans on a pair of politically cherished programs, Social Security and Medicare, drawing sustained jeers when he said some of his opponents wanted to sunset the programs. While hundreds of Republican lawmakers have signed on to plans to reduce spending on the safety net by raising retirement ages and other reductions in future benefits, Biden’s “sunset” accusation rests on the possible effects of a plan to reauthorize spending programs every five years, advanced by Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., which has gained little traction among party leaders.
Republicans called the speech a departure from Biden’s previous calls for unity and a disconnect on major economic issues.
“While the president is busy taking a premature and undeserved victory lap, lauding legislation that Democrats passed on a party-line basis, families in West Virginia and America are struggling at every turn because many of the policies and priorities of this administration have made the American dream harder to attain,” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said in a release after the address.
Biden’s allies cheered. The president “delivered a bold blueprint for an economy that, at long last, puts working people first,” Liz Shuler, the president of the powerful AFL-CIO labor union, said in a news release Tuesday evening.
Biden fashions himself a congressional dealmaker, and Tuesday, he outlined a handful of smaller-scale initiatives on other issues, like curbing the flow of fentanyl and regulating Big Tech, that might plausibly win bipartisan support in the new Congress. But the speech was not a recipe for economic compromise.

Full text: Adeed Fayaz, 26, had been shot on Saturday as he tried to buy a car in Brooklyn in response to a Facebook Marketplace post.
A New York City police officer died from his injuries on Tuesday after he was shot while off duty during a robbery attempt as he tried to buy a car in Brooklyn, police officials said.
The officer, Adeed Fayaz, 26, a five-year veteran of the department, had been hospitalized at Brookdale Hospital in Brooklyn for three days since the shooting on Saturday night. Mr. Fayaz, an officer in the 66th precinct in Borough Park, Brooklyn, was married and the father of two young children, officials said.
"Police Officer Adeed Fayaz was a father, a husband, a son, and a protector of our great city," the police commissioner, Keechant Sewell, said on Twitter in a post announcing his death.
Randy Jones, 38, of East Harlem, was arrested in connection with the shooting on Monday night and charged with murder and attempted robbery on Tuesday evening.
According to the police, the two men had arranged over Facebook Marketplace to meet so that Mr. Fayaz could purchase a Honda Pilot for $ 24,000. After Mr. Fayaz arrived at an address in East New York, Brooklyn, at around 6:50 p.m. on Saturday, along with his brother-in-law, Mr. Jones "jokingly" asked the men if they were carrying guns while walking them down a driveway, James Essig, the New York Police Department's chief of detectives, said at a news conference on Tuesday.
Both men said no, Chief Essig said, and Mr. Jones then pulled Mr. Fayaz into a headlock, pointed a gun to his head and demanded money, he said. When Mr. Fayaz said that he didn't have any money, Mr. Jones pointed the gun at Mr. Fayaz's brother-in-law, Chief Essig said, giving the officer a chance to break free of the headlock.
At that point, the gunman fired and struck Mr. Fayaz in the head, Chief Essig said, and fled while continuing to fire at both men.
The brother-in-law was able to grab a firearm off Mr. Fayaz's hip and fired toward Mr. Jones at least six times as he fled, Chief Essig said.
The incident unfolded in "a matter of seconds," he said.
Using dashcam video from Mr. Fayaz's brother-in-law, officers were able to connect the 2011 BMW that Mr. Jones drove away in to his mother, Chief Essig said.
With additional video footage, Mr. Jones was located by officers at a Days Inn in Nanuet, N.Y., on Monday night along with his girlfriend and five children, he said.
When he was arrested, Mr. Jones was cuffed using Mr. Fayaz's handcuffs, Chief Essig said, adding, "We wanted him to know what he did to that officer, and that officer's cuffs were on him, and I think it sends a powerful message."
He said the department is looking into "a few other" Facebook Marketplace robberies -- one that happened in January close to where Mr. Fayaz was shot and others in Southeast Queens -- to see if there were any connections to Mr. Jones.

When the Air-Conditioner Sputtered, Things Heated Up: [Society Desk]

Full text: Harvey Starin first considered Dorine Seidman, a former president of their homeowner's association, "stern and scary." That changed.
In July 2019, after a committee meeting of their homeowners association, Dorine Ruth Seidman, 77, asked Harvey David Starin, 76, if he wanted to grab dinner at Papa Giuseppe's, an Italian restaurant in Delray Beach, Fla., where both lived. Her invitation was made in a neighborly way, without a hint of romance.
"I think she felt sorry for me," said Mr. Starin, whose wife of 43 years, Dottie Starin, had died two months earlier.
He and his wife had moved to their boating community in 2000 from Chester, N.J., while Ms Seidman and her husband, Bob Goldsteen, moved there later that same year from Silver Spring, Md. After a 24-year marriage, her husband died in 2007. So she could identify with Mr. Starin's grief.
Mr. Starin and Mr. Goldsteen both loved fishing, and even went trolling together for mahi-mahi and bottom fishing for grouper and snapper.
Soon Ms. Seidman and Mr. Starin thought nothing of grabbing a bite after a meeting, and a couple of months later they even caught a movie or two.
Mr. Starin, then president of the association, always thought of Ms. Seidman, a former association president, as "stern and scary," the perfect negotiator. (She's about 5-foot-2; he, six feet.)
Ms. Seidman retired as a corporate counsel from the Paris-based hospitality company Sodexo, originally part of the Marriott Corporation, for which she previously worked. She then did legal consulting based in Delray Beach. Ms. Seidman, who grew up in West Hartford, Conn., graduated from Simmons College (now Simmons University) in Boston. She received a master's degree from Teachers College, Columbia University and later a law degree from Georgetown.
Mr. Starin retired as a general manager of new business development in Holmdel, N.J., from Lucent Technologies/Bell Labs, the former telecommunications company. He then became a licensed real estate broker covering Southern Palm Beach County for Realty Home Advisors in Boca Raton. He graduated with high honors from the University of Florida in Gainesville, from which he also received an M.B.A.
That fall, before the Jewish High Holy Days, Ms. Seidman offered to get him a ticket, and did, next to her and her friend in a synagogue in Boca Raton. He then joined them for a break fast after Yom Kippur at another friend's place.
"Are you shacking up?" she recalled a guest asking, to which Mr. Starin joked, "Not yet."
"I hadn't dated in over 40 years," he said. "I lost my moves, but it worked out."

In October, they had their first kiss as he left her house one evening. When his air-conditioner broke down later that month, she invited him to stay over. Things soon heated up.
"I was conscious he was a recent widower," she said. "I did not want to rush things. He needed to heal and grieve in his own time. I didn't want to intrude on that."
It was not a smooth transition for Mr. Starin. "My wife's death was relatively new," he said. "I had professional help. It was nice when I realized there was somebody who liked me and I liked very much and I could move on together."
In November 2019, they took a trip to the Florida Keys in his old red BMW convertible, and they picnicked on his fishing boat in Lake Boca in Boca Raton.
By February 2020, they spent so much time together, that Mr. Starin brought up living together. They soon looked at golf communities, and joined a golf club at one in Boca Raton as outside members.
During the pandemic lockdown, they took long walks and drives to Palm Beach in his new, more roomy blue BMW convertible.
"He whipped up caponata, ratatouille, stuffed peppers," she said, from boxes of peppers, tomatoes and eggplants being sold by local farms.
During Memorial Day weekend 2021, with Mr. Starin's expertise as a broker, they closed on a house at the Boca Raton golf community, and had sold Ms. Seidman's house within a week. His house sold at the end of last year.
"We were a new couple," he said. "We wanted to start fresh, in a nice way. We upsized."
They kept tarps over her furniture during a gut renovation, and then moved into their new place on Halloween.
"Marriage was not on the table," Ms. Seidman said.
At least not until the next summer.
In July 2022, he asked: "Would you ever consider being married?" They dropped the subject until she brought it up a month later.
"Maybe that's not such a bad idea," she said.
He proposed a few weeks later at their house. "I'm going to get down on one knee," he said. "But I'm not sure I can get up."
On Jan. 14, Rabbi Richard Polirer officiated before 30 guests on the pool deck of their new house in Boca Raton, under a huppah that Mr. Starin built using garden trellises painted white and a white tulle cover.
"I feel like we have the world in front of us," she said, "to travel, play golf and enjoy the years we have left."

SALINAS VICTORIA, Mexico — Bill Chan had never set foot anywhere in Mexico, let alone the lonely stretch of desert in the north of the country where he abruptly decided to build a $300 million factory. But that seemed a trifling detail amid the pressure to adapt to a swiftly changing global economy.
It was January 2022, and Chan’s company, Man Wah Furniture Manufacturing, was confronting grave challenges in moving sofas from its factories in China to customers in the United States. Shipping prices were skyrocketing. Washington and Beijing were locked in a fierce trade war.
Man Wah, one of China’s largest furniture companies, was eager to make its products on the North American side of the Pacific.
“Our main market is the United States,” said Chan, CEO of Man Wah’s Mexico subsidiary. “We don’t want to lose that market.”
That same objective explains why scores of major Chinese companies are investing aggressively in Mexico, taking advantage of an expansive North American trade deal. Tracing a path forged by Japanese and South Korean companies, Chinese firms are establishing factories that allow them to label their goods “Made in Mexico,” then trucking their products into the United States duty-free.
The interest of Chinese manufacturers in Mexico is part of a broader trend known as nearshoring. International companies are moving production closer to customers to limit their vulnerability to shipping problems and geopolitical tensions.
The participation of Chinese companies in this shift attests to the deepening assumption that the breach dividing the United States and China will be an enduring feature of the next phase of globalization. Yet it also reveals something more fundamental: Whatever the political strains, the commercial forces linking the United States and China are even more powerful.
Chinese companies have no intention of forsaking the American economy, still the largest on Earth. Instead, they are setting up operations inside the North American trading bloc as a way to supply Americans with goods, from electronics to clothing to furniture.
The Mexican border state of Nuevo León has positioned itself to reap the bounty. Led by a brash, 35-year-old governor, Samuel García, the state has courted foreign investment while pursuing highway improvements to ease the passage to border crossings.
García recently attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to recruit more companies.
“Nuevo León is having a geopolitical planetary alignment,” the governor declared during an interview in the state capital of Monterrey, inside the government palace, a warren of grand rooms with high ceilings and balconies looking out to the jagged peaks of the Sierra Madre. “We’re receiving lots of Asians that want to come to the U.S. market.”
Since García took office in October 2021, nearly $7 billion in foreign investment has poured into Nuevo León, making the state the largest recipient after Mexico City, according to the Mexican Ministry of Economy.
In 2021, Chinese companies were responsible for 30% of foreign investment in Nuevo León, second only to the United States at 47%.
Some of this money is financing factories that will make finished products for sale in the United States. But much is focused on a broader refashioning of the global supply chain.
As the pandemic disrupted Chinese industry and jammed ports, companies with factories in the United States suffered shortages of parts made in Asia. Many are now demanding that their suppliers set up plants in North America or risk losing their business.
Lizhong, a Chinese manufacturer of automobile wheels, is erecting the company’s first factory outside Asia at an industrial park in Nuevo León. Lizhong’s largest customers, including Ford and General Motors, pressed the company to open a factory in North America, said its general manager for Mexico, Wang Bing.
A South Korean company, DY Power, which makes components for construction equipment, is considering northern Mexico as the site for a factory near a major customer in Texas.
“After going through the pandemic and the supply chain crisis, the China COVID shutdown, many North American manufacturers would like to eliminate the risk,” said Sean Seo, a Seattle-based executive for DY Power.
“Globalization has ended,” he declared. “It’s localization now.”
César Santos has placed a substantial bet on such pronouncements proving true.
A corporate lawyer, Santos, 65, runs a sideline enterprise as a developer in Monterrey, an industrial boomtown full of upscale restaurants, glittering shopping malls and spas.
A decade ago, he was approached by a developer in Los Angeles who was representing a Chinese electronics company that was contemplating a factory in Mexico. Santos controlled an asset of considerable interest — a 2,100-acre parcel of land.
Dotted by cactus, the property sat less than 150 miles from the Texas border. While surroundings states grappled with violence linked to drug trafficking, Nuevo León carried a reputation for security. The state boasted a highly skilled workforce, given the presence of universities that churned out engineering graduates, among them Tec de Monterrey, often referred to as “Mexico’s MIT.”
The land had been his family’s cattle ranch when Santos was a child, the scene of horseback riding adventures. Now, he saw a lucrative opportunity to turn it into an industrial park.
He took a trip to China, riding a high-speed train from Shanghai to the lakefront city of Hangzhou to meet the Holley Group, which had constructed an industrial park for Chinese companies in Thailand.
“China was a country that had developed everything so fast,” Santos said. “I was really amazed.”
By 2015, he had joined with Holley and another Chinese partner to forge a joint venture, Hofusan Real Estate. They plan a grid of warehouses and factories fronted by a hotel and temporary apartments for visiting managers, plus more than 12,000 homes for workers.
The Holley Group dispatched Jiang Xin to oversee the venture. He had previously worked at the company’s project in Thailand. Mexico presented a different proposition.
“Chinese companies had no idea about Mexico, and the only things we knew were bad things, dangerous things,” Jiang said. “Then Trump came.”
When he became president in 2017, Donald Trump demanded that American companies abandon China. By 2018, he was slapping steep tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in Chinese imports.
“The tariff thing did help us,” Jiang said. “Chinese companies wanted more options. And we are one of their options.”
By the time Chan began contemplating Mexico in the fall of 2021, 27 other Chinese companies had already locked up land inside the Hofusan park. Only one large parcel remained.
Man Wah had already responded to the tariffs by building a factory in Vietnam, and using it to make products for the American market. But the soaring price of shipping beggared that strategy.
Man Wah was moving 3,500 40-foot shipping containers a month across the Pacific from Vietnam. Voyages that previously cost $2,000 were suddenly 10 times as much.
Chan used the Chinese social media platform, WeChat, to connect with Jiang. His questions were blunt. How soon could Man Wah begin construction? (Immediately.) How were the highways? (Not great, but improving.) Were there any authentic Chinese restaurants in the vicinity? (No.)
Within weeks, Man Wah had committed to purchase the land. In January 2022, Chan signed the contract before boarding a flight to Mexico, leaving his wife and two children behind in Shenzhen.
While the new factory is being constructed, Man Wah has already begun producing sofas at a small, leased plant nearby.
Even before he located the temporary site, Chan loaded 70 containers full of machinery and raw materials in China, putting them on a ship bound for Mexico.
“We always do things quickly,” he said. “Don’t worry about anything, just do it.”
Man Wah does worry about a few things: hiring enough workers and cultivating local suppliers.
The company has plans to manufacture nearly 900,000 pieces of furniture per year in Mexico. That will require hiring and retaining 6,000 workers.
Man Wah is accustomed to operating in China and Vietnam, where independent labor unions are essentially banned, and where rural people stream into industrial areas in pursuit of jobs.
In Nuevo León, the unemployment rate is 3.6%. The surge of investment has set off a fierce competition for workers.
Savvy companies have wooed their employees with extras like quality meals and transportation to work. But Man Wah and other Chinese companies answer to bosses in China, who are conditioned toward thrift while thinking of workers as easily replaceable.
Finding local suppliers is also a challenge. Under the terms of the North American trade agreement, manufacturers must employ minimum percentages of parts and raw materials from within the region to qualify for duty-free access to the other countries in the bloc.
Three years ago, Lenovo, the Chinese computer maker, opened a new factory in Monterrey dedicated to making servers, the boxes that hold data for cloud computing.
Until last year, Lenovo flew in one crucial component — so-called motherboards — from a factory in China. But as international shipping troubles intensified, the company switched to a supplier in the Mexican city of Guadalajara.
Lenovo also stopped importing packaging materials from China, instead buying them in Mexico.
But Lenovo continues to import many key components from China, from memory devices to specialized cables.
“There’s no supply chain for these things in Mexico,” said Leandro Sardela, the company’s western operations director.

Could Air Someday Power Your Flight? Airlines Are Betting on It.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: New technologies, including one fuel extracted from the atmosphere itself, could make flying more sustainable. But the challenges are many and the timeline is uncertain.
By the middle of this century, most cars and buses should be powered by renewable energy, while bikes, electric trains and your own two feet will continue to have little impact on the climate. And if global aviation achieves the goal it adopted last year, then your 2050 flight from New York to Hong Kong will result in "net zero" carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
There's no guarantee that the industry will get there, but the technologies being developed in pursuit of the target will change aviation, regardless of whether the goal is met.
In the years leading up to the pandemic, aviation emitted roughly a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, about as much as the entire continent of South America in 2021. And the figures are bouncing back as passengers return to the skies. But major airlines, including six of the largest U.S. airlines, have pledged to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, if not sooner. At a meeting in October of the United Nations agency dedicated to civil aviation, delegates from 184 countries adopted net zero by 2050 as a "long-term global aspirational goal."
"Aspirational" is the operative word. Aviation is what experts refer to as a hard-to-abate sector, meaning there aren't currently any easy, market-ready technologies that can drastically reduce its carbon emissions. And the "net" qualifier attached to the goal means that airlines can account for any CO2 they continue to emit either by using traditional carbon offsets, a practice that has attracted major criticism, or by capturing carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere.
Scientists have also found that contrails -- the wispy, short-lived clouds that sometimes appear in an airplane's wake -- affect the planet's temperature, perhaps even more so than the carbon dioxide they release. It all adds up to a complex picture, especially given that global demand for aviation is expected to double over the next 20 years.
But new technologies are in the works, including hydrogen-powered aircraft, fully electric planes and synthetic jet fuel made from carbon extracted from the atmosphere. Several airlines have already begun adding a small amount of cleaner-burning biofuel -- known in the industry as sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF -- to their normal fuel supply, a trend that should accelerate. Many companies are getting out ahead of government regulations, investing in emissions-saving efficiency improvements while also, in some cases, making big bets on long-shot innovations that could dramatically reduce emissions in the future.
"We have to start now," said Steven Barrett, a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the director of the M.I.T. Laboratory for Aviation and the Environment. "There's such huge inertia in the system that you really have to start decades ahead."
But movement isn't happening as quickly as it could, said Pedro Piris-Cabezas, senior director for global transportation and lead senior economist at the Environmental Defense Fund, a New York-based nonprofit environmental group.
He noted that delegates at the October meeting had yet to adopt a concrete plan to achieve their 2050 goal. "We need these near-term and medium-term goals to start becoming more stringent," Dr. Piris-Cabezas said.
Moving toward alternative fuels
Airlines are already investing in improvements that can deliver relatively quick wins: retiring older aircraft, finding more efficient routes, having their planes taxi with only one engine running. But such measures go only so far.
Another short-term innovation is sustainable aviation fuel, a type of biofuel that's most often made from used cooking oil and similar biomass. Over its life cycle, SAF can produce less carbon dioxide than conventional jet fuel, with which it may be blended. But SAF production remains limited and it is expensive, so airlines have been moving slowly, mixing small amounts into their existing fuel supply at select locations.
But enthusiasm inside the industry is high.
"We love SAF as an industry," said Sara Bogdan, the head of sustainability and environmental and social governance at JetBlue Airways. Ms. Bogdan said SAF is mixed into the fuel supplies of JetBlue flights departing from the international airports in San Francisco and Los Angeles. The choice of airports is no accident: One of the few major suppliers of SAF has a production facility in California, and the state has introduced a low-carbon fuel standard that encourages SAF and other alternatives.
United Airlines has also focused on some of its California flights when it comes to using SAF. Lauren Riley, the company's chief sustainability officer, said that SAF had been mixed into the fuel of every United flight that had departed from Los Angeles International Airport since 2016, and from Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam since last spring. United has also brought together a group of companies -- including Deloitte, Nike and Siemens -- that pay to help the airline cover the additional cost of SAF for their business travel.
"If you went out and bought sustainable aviation fuel, it would be two to four times more expensive than the cost of conventional jet fuel," Ms. Riley said. "We cannot afford that on our own."
Ms. Riley added that in any given year, SAF accounts for less than 0.1 percent of United's total fuel supply -- a figure that holds true across the industry. United and JetBlue are among the more than two dozen airlines that have joined a coalition, led by the World Economic Forum, that has pledged to make SAF account for 10 percent of the aviation's fuel supply by 2030.
But Dr. Piris-Cabezas warned that it is critical to guard against the risk that, for example, the supposedly used cooking oil in SAF production isn't actually fresh palm oil that has never seen the inside of a kitchen. In such a situation, he said, biomass-based SAF could actually have a negative impact by promoting the clearing of forests for monoculture plantations.
"It's extremely important that we make sure that we have a system that is robust, that has traceability and that only incentivizes high-integrity fuels that are not going to have these negative impacts on forests," said Dr. Piris-Cabezas, who classified the SAF now in circulation as "untransparent," and noted that consumers could press their airlines for greater clarity.
Power from the atmosphere
Transparency aside, there's an important barrier to producing huge volumes of SAF, said Andreas Schäfer, the director of the Air Transportation Systems Laboratory at University College London: We don't have nearly enough used cooking oil and similar biomass residues to produce anything like the amount of fuel that aviation requires. (Dr. Schäfer added that SAF is a misnomer: "It should be more-sustainable aviation fuel," he said, because the fuels still emit carbon dioxide.)
Scientists are exploring alternative sources of carbon for SAF, including algae, yard trimmings and food waste. But perhaps the most intriguing potential source is the air we breathe, which, of course, is full of carbon dioxide.
Researchers have already developed the technology for this process, known as "power to liquid." It uses enormous fans to scrub carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, then extract the carbon from the CO2 molecule before combining it with hydrogen produced from water electroylsis that's powered by renewable energy. The result is a hydrocarbon that can be used to power an airplane.
"It's promising," Dr. Schäfer said, "because there has been some quite rapid development in this area. The key challenge is the high cost."
That cost is mainly because of the enormous amount of clean energy required to produce the fuel in significant volumes. But the cost of renewable electricity is falling so quickly that by 2035, "power-to-electric" fuel could be cheaper to produce than most SAF made from biomass.
Another innovation has been on the radar since at least the Cold War: hydrogen-powered aircraft. But the engineering challenges here are significant. Hydrogen as a gas is too voluminous to be stored in useful quantities on board an airplane, so it has to be cooled to minus 253 Celsius, or about minus 423 Fahrenheit, the temperature at which hydrogen condenses into a liquid. Cryogenic infrastructure for fueling and storage would also need to be built at airports around the world.
But the technology exists: NASA and the European Space Agency have long used it successfully, and researchers at companies like Airbus and Rolls-Royce are working to adapt the technology for commercial aviation.
"With hydrogen, you can actually get to the point where you have zero carbon emissions," said Lahiru Ranasinghe, the senior sustainability manager at easyJet, a European low-cost airline that is investing in hydrogen-powered technology.
Electric-powered flight is another low-carbon option. Because of the current limitations of the batteries that power their engines, fully electric aircraft lack the energy to propel large planes over long distances, but they could offer a solution for smaller planes flying shorter routes. On this front, Norway appears to be leading the way: According to Avinor, the Norwegian airport operator, all of the country's domestic flights should be fully electric by 2040. Wideroe, a Norwegian regional carrier, plans to have its first fully electric aircraft in service by 2026.
A wispy, icy climate culprit
The aviation industry has focused on cutting back on carbon, but several academics say that there is a low-hanging fruit in terms of reducing the climate impact of flying. It turns out that contrails have a profound impact on the planet's temperature.
"At a very high level, we've known for more than 20 years that contrail warming has been very significant -- and comparable to CO2," said Dr. Barrett of M.I.T.
The science is complicated, Dr. Barrett said, because their effect depends on the time of day. At night, contrails trap heat radiating off the earth, leading to additional warming. But during the day, contrails also radiate the sun's energy back into the atmosphere and can actually have a cooling effect. But studies have shown that the overall impact is one of significant warming -- anywhere from half to three times the effect of the aviation industry's carbon dioxide emissions.
Dr. Barrett is working with Delta Air Lines to study how making slight shifts to flight routes could help. He says there is potential for easy wins: Contrails form only in specific conditions (when it's cold and humid) and at narrow bands in altitude. That means that it's relatively easy -- and cheap -- for airlines to reroute their planes to avoid them.
"Eliminating contrails is quite a big lever on mitigating the climate impact of aviation," he said.
David Victor, a co-director of the Deep Decarbonization Initiative at the University of California San Diego, echoed the importance of addressing the warming impacts of contrails, as did Dr. Schäfer at University College London.
But with regard to the industry's efforts to cut out carbon, Dr. Victor argued that in an ideal world, the carbon offset market would be out of the picture.
"The track record in demonstrating quality is so atrocious," Dr. Victor said of traditional carbon offsets. "You've got all these garbage offsets that have been flooding into the market. That's been driving down the overall price, and also driving down the quality."
Dr. Victor suggested that concerned travelers could use an online carbon footprint calculator to see how their flying habits fit into their overall impact on the climate. But he stressed that individual decisions will make a difference only at the margins; the whole system needs a radical change, he said.
"If we do all this in a way that makes us miserable, then that's not sustainable," Dr. Victor said. "It's got to be something that the whole of society is going to do."

Another innovation has been on the radar since at least the Cold War: hydrogen-powered aircraft. But the engineering challenges here are significant. Hydrogen as a gas is too voluminous to be stored in useful quantities on board an airplane, so it has to be cooled to minus 253 Celsius, or about minus 423 Fahrenheit, the temperature at which hydrogen condenses into a liquid. Cryogenic infrastructure for fueling and storage would also need to be built at airports around the world.
But the technology exists: NASA and the European Space Agency have long used it successfully, and researchers at companies such as Airbus and Rolls-Royce are working to adapt the technology for commercial aviation.
“With hydrogen, you can actually get to the point where you have zero carbon emissions,” said Lahiru Ranasinghe, senior sustainability manager at easyJet, a European low-cost airline that is investing in hydrogen-powered technology.
Electric-powered flight is another low-carbon option. Because of the current limitations of the batteries that power their engines, fully electric aircraft lack the energy to propel large planes over long distances, but they could offer a solution for smaller planes flying shorter routes. On this front, Norway appears to be leading the way: According to Avinor, the Norwegian airport operator, all of the country’s domestic flights should be fully electric by 2040. Wideroe, a Norwegian regional carrier, plans to have its first fully electric aircraft in service by 2026.
A Wispy, Icy Climate Culprit
The aviation industry has focused on cutting back on carbon, but several academics say that there is a low-hanging fruit in terms of reducing the climate impact of flying. It turns out that contrails have a profound impact on the planet’s temperature.
“At a very high level, we’ve known for more than 20 years that contrail warming has been very significant — and comparable to CO2,” said Barrett of MIT.
The science is complicated, Barrett said, because their effect depends on the time of day. At night, contrails trap heat radiating off the earth, leading to additional warming. But during the day, contrails also radiate the sun’s energy back into the atmosphere and can actually have a cooling effect. But studies have shown that the overall impact is one of significant warming — anywhere from half to three times the effect of the aviation industry’s carbon dioxide emissions.
Barrett is working with Delta Air Lines to study how making slight shifts to flight routes could help. He says there is potential for easy wins: Contrails form only in specific conditions (when it’s cold and humid) and at narrow bands in altitude. That means that it’s relatively easy — and cheap — for airlines to reroute their planes to avoid them.
“Eliminating contrails is quite a big lever on mitigating the climate impact of aviation,” he said.
David Victor, a co-director of the Deep Decarbonization Initiative at the University of California San Diego, echoed the importance of addressing the warming impacts of contrails, as did Schäfer at University College London.
But with regard to the industry’s efforts to cut out carbon, Victor argued that in an ideal world, the carbon offset market would be out of the picture.
“The track record in demonstrating quality is so atrocious,” Victor said of traditional carbon offsets. “You’ve got all these garbage offsets that have been flooding into the market. That’s been driving down the overall price, and also driving down the quality.”
Victor suggested that concerned travelers could use an online carbon footprint calculator to see how their flying habits fit into their overall impact on the climate. But he stressed that individual decisions will make a difference only at the margins; the whole system needs a radical change, he said.
“If we do all this in a way that makes us miserable, then that’s not sustainable,” Victor said. “It’s got to be something that the whole of society is going to do.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Reflecting on a Career And the LIV Golf Tour: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The members of the DP World Tour, whose next event kicks off on Thursday at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship on Yas Links in the United Arab Emirates, owe a great deal to the European players who helped make the tour what it is today.
That includes Tony Jacklin, the winner of the 1969 British Open, the 1970 United States Open and eight tournaments on the European Tour, now the DP World Tour.
Jacklin, from England, also played a huge role in the Ryder Cup. A four-time captain from 1983 to 1989, he led Team Europe to two victories, including the first over the Americans since 1957.
Jacklin, 78, reflected recently on his career, on the controversy over the Saudi-financed LIV Golf tour that guarantees entrants six-figure payouts and the game that has meant so much to him.
The following conversation has been edited and condensed.
When you won your two majors, what did that fame feel like?
I was achieving my goals, and it was a satisfying feeling, obviously, to be respected by my peers and by the general public wherever I went. I felt like I earned that during that period.
Any downside to the fame?
Yeah. For example, in England, I couldn't go into pubs. If you went anywhere where alcohol was sold, I was always aware that [people] could come up and say something negative and spoil things. I kept myself very much to myself. I wasn't a party animal ever. I realized as I went along, that's it's a give and it's a take. You couldn't do the things when you're famous that you could have done when you weren't.
Did one Open mean more than the other?
[The British Open] was the one that I wanted the most. Having achieved that and to be able to achieve the U.S. Open, it was like I owned the world. There was no substitute for that feeling. Putting your head on the pillow on those given evenings and knowing that you beat everybody who turned up, it's an immeasurable memory.
Let's say it's 1970, 1971 after your two major wins. If someone had given you the kind of money that LIV offers, would you have listened?
I would have probably listened, but I had everything I wanted in 1971. I was happily married. I had started a family. I had a Rolls-Royce. I had nice houses. I never made money the main criteria. I just wanted to be the best player in the world. I was smart enough to know that money would follow if I achieved that.
How do you feel about the players who have joined LIV?
I think everyone has got to do what they think is right for them. It's not my job to tell somebody how much is enough. About the only thing I would ever look back on and have, if I'd had all the money in the world, is a private plane to take me where I wanted to go.
Do you still hit golf balls?
I haven't touched a golf club for six months. When you lose your flexibility, it's no fun. Golf, it's a battle, a disappointment these days. My body won't do what I want it to do.
Do you think you'll ever play again?
I might. We do this [event during the Insperity Invitational] in Texas called the 3M Greats of Golf, and if I get the call to arms, as it were, I shall hit a few balls a couple of weeks before. If that doesn't happen, it doesn't worry me.
You've hit enough balls in your lifetime, haven't you?
I certainly have and it's been great.

Democratic Senators Press Southwest Over Meltdown
A group of Democratic senators are seeking an explanation from Southwest Airlines for its operational meltdown last month. In a letter sent on Wednesday to Southwest's chief executive, Bob Jordan, the lawmakers posed dozens of questions to the airline, addressing topics like its flight-crew scheduling system, ticket refunds and executive compensation. The letter was signed by 13 members of the Senate Democratic caucus, including Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, who spearheaded it. "No business can treat its customers like that and get away with it," Mr. Markey said. Around Christmas, a storm wreaked havoc on Southwest's operations, leaving travelers stranded during the busy holiday travel season. While other airlines were able to recover, Southwest found itself crippled, in part as a result of outdated scheduling technology for its flight crews. In total, the airline canceled more than 16,700 flights. MARK WALKER

Porsche Considers Deal To Put Google in Cockpit
Porsche is considering fully integrating Google software into its car cockpit, a source close to the company said on Thursday. The deal would enable Porsche customers access to applications like Google Maps and Google Assistant without needing to connect the car to an Android phone. Porsche had previously been reluctant to use Google software because Google asked for too much data to be shared, according to Manager Magazin, which first reported the talks. Technology companies from Google to Apple and Amazon are in a race to control carmakers' dashboards as software becomes an integral part of car design. But some automakers are wary of allowing the tech giants unfettered access to the data generated by connected cars, or to allow them to displace the automakers' brands with their own in dashboard displays. BMW, for example, was "definitely not taking the path" of integrating Google Automotive Services into its cars, a spokesperson said. REUTERS

CNN Plans to Move Out Of CNN Center in Atlanta
CNN is moving out of the CNN Center, its longtime downtown Atlanta home, by the end of this year. The cable channel's weekday anchors are all already in New York or Washington, but CNN still has digital and CNN International operations in Atlanta. A spokeswoman, Bridget Leininger, confirmed in an email that the remaining CNN employees and operations in Atlanta would move to the Techwood Turner Broadcasting campus in Midtown. The move will happen in stages and will finish by the end of this year, Leininger said. CNN's previous parent company, AT&T, sold the CNN Center for nearly $ 164 million to two Florida-based real estate firms, CP Group and Rialto Capital, in 2021, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. It was not immediately clear what would happen to the building's other tenants. ASSOCIATED PRESS

5 Dead After Being Mowed Down in China: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The police in Guangzhou detained a 22-year-old man, who appeared to throw money in the air after striking the people. Thirteen people were injured.
A driver sped into pedestrians in a busy intersection in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, killing at least five people and injuring more than a dozen others, according to the police and videos posted online.
Officers arrested a 22-year-old man and were trying to determine a motive, according to the city's public security bureau. Videos appeared to show the driver throwing money into the air after hitting the people and before being apprehended.
The incident, which took place on Wednesday during the afternoon rush hour, set off shock and anger online and in Guangzhou, a city of more than 18 million people and the capital of Guangdong Province.
Footage of the scene, in the busy Tianhe district, showed a black BMW S.U.V. entering the intersection of Tianhe Road and Tiyu East Road at high speed, making turns as it struck pedestrians and motorists in multiple crossings.
Afterward, victims lay immobile and bloodied on the roads, stray shoes and phones scattered around them. "There was a collective wail," Hym Chu, a 25-year-old photographer, wrote in a post on Weibo, a Twitter-like social platform. "Everyone ran."
Mr. Chu said he stayed for two hours at the chaotic scene, retrieving belongings for the injured and helping to move the damaged motorcycle of a delivery worker.
In one video of the driver, filmed while he was being held to the ground, he shouted that his uncle was Huang Kunming, the Communist Party secretary of Guangdong Province. It was unclear whether that was true.
It is rare for vehicles to be deliberately driven into crowds in China, but reckless driving involving luxury cars has sometimes stoked public anger, touching a nerve in a country with a stark wealth gap.
More than a decade ago, in the northeastern city of Baoding, the son of Li Gang, a deputy police chief, killed a college student while drunkenly driving his Volkswagen sedan. As he was apprehended, he yelled, "My father is Li Gang!" Propaganda officials tried to cover up the incident, but the phrase became a grim joke symbolizing the impunity of powerful local officials and those connected to them.
Within hours of the Guangzhou incident on Wednesday, it became one of the top trending topics on Weibo, with many users decrying the senseless deaths and disparaging the driver. By Thursday morning, several graphic videos and photos from the scene had been taken down by censors.

McDonald's Former Chief Faces S.E.C. Charges
Stephen Easterbrook, the former McDonald's C.E.O., has been charged by federal regulators with making false and misleading statements to investors about the circumstances of his firing by the burger giant in November 2019.
Mr. Easterbrook was ousted for engaging in an inappropriate personal relationship with a McDonald's employee in violation of company policy, the Securities and Exchange Commission said in its order Monday. But the separation agreement with McDonald's concluded that his termination was without cause, which allowed him to keep substantial compensation in McDonald's stock that he otherwise would have forfeited, the agency said.
The S.E.C. said Mr. Easterbrook's separation agreement was valued at more than $ 40 million.
Mr. Easterbrook told his company at the time that there were no other similar instances. But in July 2020, McDonald's found otherwise. ASSOCIATED PRESS

U.S. Safety Regulators Question Musk Tweet
A tweet from Elon Musk indicating that Tesla might allow some owners who are testing a "Full Self-Driving" system to disable an alert that reminds them to keep their hands on the steering wheel has drawn attention from U.S. safety regulators.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says it asked Tesla for more information about the tweet. Last week, the agency said the issue is now part of a broader investigation into at least 14 Teslas that have crashed into emergency vehicles while using the Autopilot driver assist system.
Since 2021, Tesla has been beta-testing "Full Self-Driving" using owners who haven't been trained on the system but are actively monitored by the company. Earlier this year, Tesla said 160,000, roughly 15 percent of Teslas on U.S. roads, were participating. A wider distribution of the software was to be rolled out late in 2022.
Despite the name, Tesla still says on its website that the cars can't drive themselves.

Rolls-Royce Enjoyed Record Sales in 2022
Rolls-Royce on Monday reported record sales last year despite an average price tag of around $ 534,000 for its luxury cars and a drop in Chinese demand, with orders stretching into 2023.
The British carmaker, which began as Rolls-Royce in Manchester, England, nearly 120 years ago and is now owned by Germany's BMW, said that it sold 6,021 cars in 2022, up from 5,586 in 2021, which was also a record year.
Rolls-Royce's sales were led by the Americas, with the U.S. comprising around 35 percent of sales. In China, coronavirus-related lockdowns led to a "single-digit drop" in sales.
But Torsten Müller-Ötvös, Rolls-Royce's chief executive, said in an online presentation that this decrease was offset by growth in other markets.
Rolls-Royce said that pre-orders for its fully-electric Spectre, due to go on sale at the end of 2023, had exceeded all expectations.

Are This Town's Dirt Roads Worth Saving?: [Metropolitan Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For one town on the Hudson River, the soul of the place is found in its dirt roads. That is, unless you have to drive on them in bad weather.

As a girl growing up in the late 1970s, Heather Uhlar spent many happy hours riding her pony along the dirt roads in her hometown, Chatham, N.Y., stopping here and there to swim in a creek or amble through rolling pastures flecked with asters and goldenrods.
Even then, she understood that Chatham's dirt roads were something wonderful.
"I just always thought dirt roads gave our area character," Ms. Uhlar said recently. "They made us special."
Since then, as Chatham has grown, Ms. Uhlar has seen some of the prettiest roads get paved over. In her dismay, she helped start a nonprofit, the Chatham Dirt Road Coalition, which lobbies to promote an appreciation for dirt roads and slow the advance of the asphalt trucks.
It turned out a lot of people felt as she did: In a town of about 4,100 people, her Facebook group now has more than 1,300 members. According to the coalition's website, dirt roads "are a living connection to our history." The site features a hand-drawn map of the town, which depicts Chatham's network of dirt roads in light brown.
Not everyone shares Ms. Uhlar's enthusiasm for dirt roads. Unpaved byways are difficult to maintain and costlier in the long run than gravel; they are also muddy in ‌spring and dusty in ‌summer.
"Honestly," said Jeff Antalek, Chatham's highway superintendent, "I've never gotten a call from anybody that lives on a paved road that told me they want me to tear it up and turn it into an unpaved road."
Mr. Antalek lives on a dirt road himself. "I have antique cars," he said. "It's a royal pain driving them in and out. They get dirty, even just sitting in my barn because of the dust off the road."
Coalition members don't dispute that dirt roads are expensive and occasionally a nuisance. They simply agree that the hassle and extra cost to maintain them are well worth it.
"It's different walking on a dirt road than it is walking on a macadam road," said John Wapner, a psychologist who lives in Chatham in an 1852 farmhouse. You can drive fast on asphalt, he said, but dirt roads force you to slow down, take in the scenery and enjoy the rural quiet. You notice things you wouldn't have otherwise.
"It feels to me like you're walking on the land, not over the land," Mr. Wapner added.
As dirt road fans see it, something essential to the town's identity is lost each time a road is paved.
A century ago, Chatham was an agricultural town, its rocky hills dominated by small dairy farms. But as family farms have gradually disappeared, more and more weekenders have arrived from New York City, two and a half hours to the south. Dirt roads that once passed only a farmhouse or two can now be shared by 20 or more residences.
Unlike some of its neighboring towns in the Hudson Valley, Chatham still has more dirt roads than asphalt ones. But traffic has grown, increasing the pressure to pave.
One chilly Sunday morning recently, Ms. Uhlar, 49, stood outside her family's stables in riding breeches and a dirt-smudged windbreaker. Part of her fondness for dirt roads stems from her love of horses. In the pasture nearby, her Irish sport horse, Valhalla, rolled on its back contentedly, as Ms. Uhlar enumerated the roads lost to asphalt during her lifetime.
There was Woodward Road, where she grew up. After it was paved, cars started driving faster past her house, and her parents grew more protective about letting her play outside. There was Jefferson Hill Road, where she used to go riding. And Drowne Road, where her mother once worked at a local advertising agency. Ms. Uhlar used to visit her there in the afternoons. "That one broke my heart," she said.
These days, she avoids riding on paved roads altogether, mostly out of concern for her horses. Too much time on asphalt, she said, can make a horse lame.
The battle between the paved and the unpaved is hardly new. In 1986, The New York Times, in an article titled "Debate on Dirt Roads: Charm vs. Comfort," chronicled how residents of Bedford, Lewisboro and other New York suburbs known for their rustic byways were unhappy about impassable and rutted roads.
Yet across the country, as development pressures increase, a growing number of towns are taking steps to preserve dirt roads. And in some cases, paved roads are being restored to gravel, said David Orr, the director of the Cornell University Local Roads Program.
Mr. Orr said the movement had gained steam in the Hudson Valley after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when many people fled the city in search of rural safety and tranquillity. Some towns have passed laws to protect dirt roads and establish new criteria for paving.
In Chatham, what ultimately spurred Ms. Uhlar to action were rumors that several big construction projects were in the works, including a vineyard that might double as a wedding venue.
"Basically, when you have huge-scale usages on dirt roads," Ms. Uhlar said, "they're going to get paved. You can't have that much traffic going up and down. Eventually, they're going to want to widen the road. And that worried me."
Her concerns were shared by Doug Welch, 69, a longtime resident who'd spent a career in advertising.
Mr. Welch grew up in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., coming to New York City after college. Eventually, he bought a second home in Chatham, the kind of picturesque old farmhouse that has been fueling the dreams of greenery-starved New Yorkers for generations. (His quaint country home turned out to have a somewhat anomalous history: During World War I, it was briefly owned by the Horwitz family, whose sons would gain fame as the Three Stooges.)
Mr. Welch quickly grew besotted by the area's rural charm and eventually moved to Chatham full time. He also became a dirt road devotee, given to quoting the naturalist John Muir, who said, "Of all the paths you take in life, make sure a few of them are dirt."
When Mr. Welch saw how popular Ms. Uhlar's group had become, he decided to marshal his advertising skills in support of the cause. His goal was nothing less than ending paving in Chatham. "You don't wait until the machines are at the end of the road," Mr. Welch said, "to let people know you value the roads."
The coalition distributed bumper stickers and the dirt road maps. It raised money to rent billboards in town, reminding residents that dirt roads are "a rural heritage worth preserving."
It also became a sponsor of a popular dirt-road bike race called the Farmer's Daughter Gravel Grinder, which draws hundreds of people to Chatham each May.
Mr. Welch discovered the coalition at an auspicious moment. The town of Chatham was drawing up a comprehensive plan, and a survey of residents showed sizable support for preserving dirt roads. Partly for budget reasons, Chatham hasn't embarked on a major paving project since then. But some town officials privately acknowledge that the coalition's efforts have also made them reluctant to broach the subject.
Of course, some people in town would love to see an asphalt truck come their way. Ronald MacFarlane lives on a dirt road that connects a major state route with a heavily traveled local one. It tends to get a lot of through traffic.
"I live 300 feet off the road, and we can get dust in the house," Mr. MacFarlane said. "When a vehicle goes by, it looks like a dust cloud, and the wind blows it up to the house eventually." Mr. MacFarlane has actually pleaded with the town to pave his road, but, he said, has been told that money's too tight.
"I even thought of running for town supervisor at one time to get it done," he added.
Paving roads can be expensive, but, in the long run, maintaining them becomes cheaper, said Mr. Antalek, the highway superintendent. Dirt roads need to be regraded each spring, at considerable expense, and a heavy rain can make them almost impassable. Last year, Chatham went through nearly 14,000 tons of gravel to fix ruts and potholes, at a cost of nearly $ 100,000.
"It's almost a losing battle with dirt roads," Mr. Antalek said. "You almost can't throw enough money at them to keep them well maintained."
Living on a dirt road can be an ordeal, especially in springtime, when the ground thaws and the roads turn into a muddy quagmire, said Gail Behrens Day, whose family are longtime farmers in Chatham. But you learn to adjust, she said. In the wet months, you take the pickup truck to town instead of the car.
"It's just the rhythm of the road," Ms. Day said. "You know there's going to be a mud season, and it's going to be days, or it could be two weeks, when it might be really bad. But it's going to get better."
And then there's washboarding, a phenomenon in which horizontal ridges form over time on the road's surface and can make a car rattle like a plane going through turbulence. Drivers who go too fast on dirt roads sooner or later pay a price in broken axles and ruined tires. Ms. Day pointed out a nearby house that was recently purchased by a musician from Brooklyn.
"When he first came, he drove too fast. Now, he doesn't drive too fast. I think he figured it out on his own," she said dryly.
Mr. Welch admits that dirt roads can be rough on cars. He said he had to replace his tires every 20,000 miles or so. But he wouldn't have it any other way.
"It's just kind of vital for the character of Chatham. If you pave the roads, it's not Chatham anymore," he said.
One afternoon, before winter had set in, as the sun drifted in and out of the clouds, Mr. Welch took his aging BMW convertible for a spin along Chatham's back roads. As an ad man, Mr. Welch understands good visuals, and several times he pulled over to rave about the pastoral vistas unfolding before him.
"Look at that view. It's amazing!" Mr. Welch said. "To me that screams 'rural."' He gestured toward a herd of brown cows grazing on a grassy hillside, the purple Catskill Mountains in the far distance. A red-tailed hawk stared down from a telephone wire. A small group of wild turkeys strutted across the road. The only sound came from a nearby stream, which turns into a torrent each spring when the snow melts. But after this year's long, dry summer it was little more than a trickle. It was a scene of utter tranquillity.
"Do you think this would be the same if this were a paved road?" he asked. "I don't think so."

Expensive, Treacherous, Beautiful: The Battle Over Dirt Roads

As a girl growing up in the late 1970s, Heather Uhlar spent many happy hours riding her pony along the dirt roads in her hometown, Chatham, New York, stopping here and there to swim in a creek or amble through rolling pastures flecked with asters and goldenrods.
Even then, she understood that Chatham’s dirt roads were something wonderful.
“I just always thought dirt roads gave our area character,” Uhlar, 49, said recently. “They made us special.”
Since then, as Chatham has grown, Uhlar has seen some of the prettiest roads get paved over. In her dismay, she helped start a nonprofit, the Chatham Dirt Road Coalition, which lobbies to promote an appreciation for dirt roads and slow the advance of the asphalt trucks.
It turned out a lot of people felt as she did: In a town of about 4,100 people, her Facebook group now has more than 1,300 members. According to the coalition’s website, dirt roads “are a living connection to our history.” The site features a hand-drawn map of the town, which depicts Chatham’s network of dirt roads in light brown.
Not everyone shares Uhlar’s enthusiasm for dirt roads. Unpaved byways are difficult to maintain and costlier in the long run than gravel; they are also muddy in spring and dusty in summer.
“Honestly,” said Jeff Antalek, Chatham’s highway superintendent, “I’ve never gotten a call from anybody that lives on a paved road that told me they want me to tear it up and turn it into an unpaved road.”
Antalek lives on a dirt road himself. “I have antique cars,” he said. “It’s a royal pain driving them in and out. They get dirty, even just sitting in my barn because of the dust off the road.”
Coalition members don’t dispute that dirt roads are expensive and occasionally a nuisance. They simply agree that the hassle and extra cost to maintain them are well worth it.
“It’s different walking on a dirt road than it is walking on a macadam road,” said John Wapner, a psychologist who lives in Chatham in an 1852 farmhouse. You can drive fast on asphalt, he said, but dirt roads force you to slow down, take in the scenery and enjoy the rural quiet. You notice things you wouldn’t have otherwise.
“It feels to me like you’re walking on the land, not over the land,” Wapner added.
As dirt road fans see it, something essential to the town’s identity is lost each time a road is paved.
A century ago, Chatham was an agricultural town, its rocky hills dominated by small dairy farms. But as family farms have gradually disappeared, more and more weekenders have arrived from New York City, 2 1/2 hours to the south. Dirt roads that once passed only a farmhouse or two can now be shared by 20 or more residences.
Unlike some of its neighboring towns in the Hudson Valley, Chatham still has more dirt roads than asphalt ones. But traffic has grown, increasing the pressure to pave.
One chilly recent Sunday morning, Uhlar stood outside her family’s stables in riding breeches and a dirt-smudged windbreaker. Part of her fondness for dirt roads stems from her love of horses. In the pasture nearby, her Irish sport horse, Valhalla, rolled on its back contentedly, as Uhlar enumerated the roads lost to asphalt during her lifetime.
There was Woodward Road, where she grew up. After it was paved, cars started driving faster past her house, and her parents grew more protective about letting her play outside. There was Jefferson Hill Road, where she used to go riding. And Drowne Road, where her mother once worked at a local advertising agency. Uhlar used to visit her there in the afternoons. “That one broke my heart,” she said.
These days, she avoids riding on paved roads altogether, mostly out of concern for her horses. Too much time on asphalt, she said, can make a horse lame.
The battle between the paved and the unpaved is hardly new. In 1986, The New York Times, in an article titled “Debate on Dirt Roads: Charm vs. Comfort,” chronicled how residents of Bedford, Lewisboro and other New York suburbs known for their rustic byways were unhappy about impassable and rutted roads.
Yet across the country, as development pressures increase, a growing number of towns are taking steps to preserve dirt roads. And in some cases, paved roads are being restored to gravel, said David Orr, director of the Cornell University Local Roads Program.
Orr said the movement had gained steam in the Hudson Valley after 9/11, when many people fled the city in search of rural safety and tranquility. Some towns have passed laws to protect dirt roads and establish new criteria for paving.
What ultimately spurred Uhlar to action were rumors that several big construction projects were in the works, including a vineyard that might double as a wedding venue.
“Basically, when you have huge-scale usages on dirt roads,” Uhlar said, “they’re going to get paved. You can’t have that much traffic going up and down. Eventually, they’re going to want to widen the road. And that worried me.”
Her concerns were shared by Doug Welch, 69, a longtime resident who had spent a career in advertising.
Welch grew up in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., coming to New York City after college. Eventually, he bought a second home in Chatham, the kind of picturesque old farmhouse that has been fueling the dreams of greenery-starved New Yorkers for generations. (His quaint country home turned out to have a somewhat anomalous history: During World War I, it was briefly owned by the Horwitz family, whose sons would gain fame as the Three Stooges.)
Welch quickly grew besotted by the area’s rural charm and eventually moved to Chatham full time. He also became a dirt road devotee, given to quoting naturalist John Muir, who said, “Of all the paths you take in life, make sure a few of them are dirt.”
When Welch saw how popular Uhlar’s group had become, he decided to marshal his advertising skills in support of the cause. His goal was nothing less than ending paving in Chatham. “You don’t wait until the machines are at the end of the road,” Welch said, “to let people know you value the roads.”
The coalition distributed bumper stickers and the dirt road maps. It raised money to rent billboards in town, reminding residents that dirt roads are “a rural heritage worth preserving.”
It also became a sponsor of a popular dirt-road bike race called the Farmer’s Daughter Gravel Grinder, which draws hundreds of people to Chatham each May.
Welch discovered the coalition at an auspicious moment. The town of Chatham was drawing up a comprehensive plan, and a survey of residents showed sizable support for preserving dirt roads. Partly for budget reasons, Chatham hasn’t embarked on a major paving project since then. But some town officials privately acknowledge that the coalition’s efforts have also made them reluctant to broach the subject.
Of course, some people in town would love to see an asphalt truck come their way. Ronald MacFarlane lives on a dirt road that connects a major state route with a heavily traveled local one. It tends to get a lot of through traffic.

Last year, Chatham went through nearly 14,000 tons of gravel to fix ruts and potholes, at a cost of nearly $100,000.
“It’s almost a losing battle with dirt roads,” Antalek said. “You almost can’t throw enough money at them to keep them well maintained.”
Living on a dirt road can be an ordeal, especially in springtime, when the ground thaws and the roads turn into a muddy quagmire, said Gail Behrens Day, whose family are longtime farmers in Chatham.

Drivers who go too fast on dirt roads sooner or later pay a price in broken axles and ruined tires. Day pointed out a nearby house that was recently purchased by a musician from Brooklyn.
“When he first came, he drove too fast. Now, he doesn’t drive too fast. I think he figured it out on his own,” she said dryly.

Climate Activists Block German Roads, Raising Awareness and Animus: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Extreme tactics have pushed the climate crisis to the top of the public discourse but also stirred debate over whether the activists are going too far.
The radical climate activists tried hunger strikes. They glued themselves to famous paintings. They tried to disrupt a classical concert. They confronted lawmakers trying to enter Parliament. They even desecrated an official Christmas tree of the city of Berlin.
It took them donning neon vests, walking into traffic at rush hour and gluing themselves to the streets in Berlin and Munich, causing miles-long backups and bringing drivers to murderous rage, to make their protest impossible to ignore.
With their actions, carried out with increasing frequency as 2022 drew to a close, they have attracted enormous attention in a country where cars reign supreme, home to BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and the autobahn. But they have also united almost everyone in politics in Berlin, and much of the public, against them.
They have become a target for conservatives and embarrassment for the governing Green Party, which has long been working within the political system toward the same goals. And their tactics have stirred debate even within the broader environmentalist movement over how much is too much in pursuit of climate goals.
The answer from the protesters, who are the German chapter of an environmental group called Last Generation, is that the climate crisis warrants drastic action. Founded in 2021 when a small number of activists went on a weekslong hunger strike in front of the Parliament building in Berlin, the group is now well-funded and has since grown to include a few hundred active members, whose actions have earned, among other things, a reference in the president's Christmas speech last week -- a sign that their protests have struck a nerve.
Their immediate demands -- things like ending food waste, enforcing strict speed limits to reduce emissions and subsidizing rail travel -- may seem tame, but their ultimate message is urgent: The world is in a climate emergency and business as usual is not an option.
"They mix claims really easy to implement, majority-winning policy claims -- things that are quite accessible for a majority of the population -- with a system criticism," said Daniel Saldivia Gonzatti, who studies protests at WZB Berlin Social Science Center. "It's effective."
And enraging. Friedrich Merz, the head of the conservative opposition, called Last Generation a criminal organization and wants the authorities to test whether it could be declared illegal. Another politician, Alexander Dobrindt, the parliamentary leader of the Bavarian conservative party, compared the group to the Red Army Faction, a notorious band of left-wing terrorists who robbed, murdered and kidnapped in the 1970s.
But to Last Generation's members, extreme action is the answer to government inaction.
"The government has ignored over one million people on the streets in Germany alone and the government is ignoring scientists," said Carla Rochel, a 20-year-old student who was one of the early members of Last Generation, referring to Fridays for Future, a series of peaceful protests that peaked before the pandemic. "That's why we decided to take to the streets and simply not go away anymore."
The mass-market daily Bild has called the traffic-stopping protesters "climate hacks" and has published unflattering portrayals of individual participants. In some states the legal system has gone into overdrive: Bavaria locked up more than a dozen Last Generation members preventively for days, and elsewhere state prosecutors raided the activists' homes and confiscated personal electronics while investigating whether the group constitutes a "criminal gang."
For group members, who besides being committed are also often well-spoken and photogenic, the negative attention has worked in their favor to an extent, giving them a prominent place in the German news media, including on televised debate shows alongside powerful politicians.
"From being called terrorists to sitting with the justice minister in a talk show in the span of the week is quite a measure of success," said Mr. Saldivia Gonzatti, the academic studying protests.
The group has drawn criticism even in environmental circles over whether its more extreme actions, which are also being used by climate activists in countries like Britain, may be backfiring and are becoming a distraction that is turning people off from the climate cause.
Luisa Neubauer, a prominent member of the Fridays for Future climate movement, said that while the group's reason for blocking traffic was legitimate, she worried that the public had become so focused on the activists that the problem of climate change had become less visible.
In much German public debate, she said, "The question has become 'How do you stand on the Last Generation?' and not 'How do you stand on the climate crisis?"'
On a recent and exceedingly chilly and damp weekday morning, six protesters from Last Generation walked into a crosswalk on a busy road leading to the storied Potsdamer Platz, one of downtown Berlin's most traffic-jam-prone spots, and unfurled banners and then little rubber seating mats.
After a second's pause, they sat down in unison and with seemingly choreographed motion each began gluing one of their hands to the wet pavement.
Within seconds, drivers starting honking and trying to go around the protesters onto the median. Within minutes, the police arrived and tried to pull away the protesters. Because the pavement was wet, the officers managed to pull four of the activists onto the sidewalk -- two more could not be budged and a special unit had to be dispatched dissolve the glue using oil and solvents.
"One of the scariest moments is when the cars start rolling toward you, pushing themselves through people as though they don't intend to stop," said Irma Trommer, 26, who has taken part in similar human road blocks dozens of times.
Not everyone thinks their form of activism is productive.
"It annoys me, maybe that's embarrassing," said Renate Künast, a Green Party stalwart and former federal minister, who has spent nearly two decades in federal politics. Democracy is a process, she said, and even in her position she can't make climate dominate the conversation in Parliament.
The activists gained a new level of infamy in November when a cyclist in Berlin died after being pinned by a cement mixer during one of the group's traffic jams.
Early reports suggested the woman could have survived if a specialized emergency vehicle could have made it through the backup. Reaction was swift, with many condemning the activist group. It later turned out that a doctor on site had already decided on a different course of action that did not require the traffic-bound emergency vehicle.
"Now at the latest we should say goodbye to the fairy tale of the harmless protest," the speaker of a powerful police union said at the time.
Polls taken just after the accident found that 80 percent of Germans were critical of the group's action and 86 percent thought the actions ended up hurting the cause of fighting climate change.
The notoriety has only galvanized the group, whose numbers have grown from just a couple of dozen in the summer to hundreds of activists and supporters. In December the group was blocking traffic in Berlin on three to four mornings a week, sometimes at multiple locations.
"The future I personally am heading for, if climate policy does not change, is so much more uncertain than anything I am taking on here," said Ms. Trommer, referring to not just the very real possibly of violence she faces from frustrated drivers, but a permanent criminal record she could walk away with.
"My hope is that by showing that I'm willing to risk myself doing these actions, how crazy threatening the global situation is for people of my age," she said, rubbing her hand, which was torn off the pavement by a policeman before the glue had set.

'I Am Ultra-MAGA': Invention of Elise Stefanik: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Elise Stefanik had had enough.
In the wake of the 2018 midterms, the young congresswoman was sick of commuting to Washington from upstate New York and weary of dialing for campaign dollars. She was demoralized that Republican primary voters had spurned so many of the women she had helped persuade to run for Congress. She was annoyed that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the democratic socialist who had displaced her that fall as the youngest woman ever elected to the House, had not shown her the respect she felt was her due.
But it was bigger than that. For years, Ms. Stefanik had crafted her brand as a model moderate millennial -- "the future of hopeful, aspirational politics in America," as her mentor, Paul Ryan, would describe her in Time magazine. But as her third term unfolded, according to current or former friends and advisers, it was becoming painfully clear that she was the future of a Republican Party that no longer existed. The party was now firmly controlled by Donald J. Trump, a populist president she didn't like or respect -- a "whack job," as she once described him in a message obtained by The New York Times. Fox hosts attacked her for not supporting Mr. Trump enough. Her friends criticized her for not opposing him more forcefully. You don't understand, she would tell them. You don't get how hard this is. Democrats were back in charge in the House. Mr. Ryan was gone, driven into early retirement. She told friends she was thinking of joining him.
Instead she embarked on one of the most brazen political transformations of the Trump era. With breathtaking speed and alacrity, Ms. Stefanik remade herself into a fervent Trump apologist, adopted his over-torqued style on Twitter and embraced the conspiracy theories that animate his base, amplifying debunked allegations of dead voters casting ballots in Atlanta and unspecified "irregularities" involving voting-machine software in 2020 swing states. The future of hopeful, aspirational politics in America now assails Democrats as "the party of Socialists, illegals, criminals, Communist Truth Ministers & media stenographers." In the process, she has rocketed from the backbench to the party's No. 3 House leadership job, presiding over the conference's overall messaging.
Ms. Stefanik's reinvention has made her a case study in the collapse of the old Republican establishment and its willing absorption into the new, Trump-dominated one. But as Republicans prepare to take control of the House in the coming days, her climb to MAGA stardom may also be a cautionary tale. Mr. Trump's obsession with litigating his own defeat has left him at once the party's most potent force and its greatest liability, blamed by many Republicans for their failure to win the Senate in November and for a House majority that, some fear, may be too narrow to govern effectively. Republican politicians and voters are now agonizing anew over the price of their alliance with Mr. Trump. "It's crystal, crystal, crystal clear," Mr. Ryan told SiriusXM. "We lose with Trump if we stick with Trump. If we dump Trump, we start winning."
For her part, Ms. Stefanik has only doubled down, betting that her alliance with Mr. Trump will carry her further still -- to a job in his cabinet, perhaps, or even a slot as his running mate in 2024. In November, even before Mr. Trump made his bid for re-election official, she became one of the few senior Republicans to endorse him. "Republican voters determine who is the leader of the Republican Party, and it's very clear President Trump is the leader of the Republican Party," she said, putting her loyalty on display in the way that Mr. Trump prizes.
That loyalty has already exacted a steep cost. Within the old-line Republican circles that spent years grooming Ms. Stefanik for a different kind of stardom, charting her turn toward Mr. Trump has become a kind of morose parlor game. Mr. Ryan has told associates he now considers her the biggest disappointment of his political career. One by one, many of her oldest and closest friends have stopped speaking to Ms. Stefanik, leaving a trail of embittered final texts and emails. Over dinners and group chats, they sometimes talk about what happened to the talented woman they once loved and respected. What really made her abandon her old political self? What had they missed?
Ms. Stefanik insists they missed nothing at all. She declined to be interviewed by The Times. But in a statement responding to questions for this article, Alex deGrasse, executive director of her political operation, denied she had ever considered quitting Congress and repeatedly rejected criticism of her as sexist. Mr. deGrasse denounced "anonymous sources who are clearly viciously Anti-Trump, Anti-Elise, and Anti-Republican," who "clearly hate the American people who support Trump." As criticism of her has mounted from former friends and allies, Ms. Stefanik has argued that in embracing Mr. Trump, she is merely serving her older, predominantly white and rural constituency, as she has since first being elected. "I'm the same member of Congress that I've always been," she said after her breakout performance defending Mr. Trump during his first impeachment.
In an important sense, Ms. Stefanik is right. Virtually no one who knows her believes she has any genuine attachment to Trump-style populism -- unlike Mr. Trump's earliest supporters, for example, or media figures like the Fox host Tucker Carlson. Indeed, over dozens of interviews, former aides, advisers and friends going back to Ms. Stefanik's Harvard days struggled to identify any of her deeply held political beliefs at all. Most recalled, instead, her generic loyalty to the Republican Party, her intense competitiveness and her unerring ability to absorb what she thought people around her wanted and to reflect it back at them. Eager to advance, skilled at impressing more powerful figures with her intelligence and work ethic, she has spent years embedding herself wherever the action seems to be at the time. "She knows exactly what she's signed up for," said Kate Yearwood Young, a former friend from Harvard. "There was no radicalization."
'I Am Ultra-MAGA'
One day this past October, Ms. Stefanik stood in front of a dozen gigantic bins of bovine teat cleanser, decrying the war on chocolate milk to a nodding crowd of farmers. Months earlier, New York City's quirkily centrist mayor, Eric Adams, had floated the idea of banning chocolate milk from city schools, then quickly abandoned the idea amid bipartisan criticism. Now, in the closing weeks of the campaign, Ms. Stefanik had come to the Mohawk Valley village of Fultonville, seizing a chance to simultaneously defend local businesses and stoke her constituents' age-old suspicions of big-city liberals. "We are seeing really bad ideas from the progressive left," she warned, adding, "I've been proud to be the leader standing up for chocolate milk."
Like Mr. Trump, Ms. Stefanik, who is 38, does not merely advocate policies; she casts herself as a warrior against the leftist forces scheming to take away the things that make America great. She speaks MAGA fluently but with a touch of a foreign accent. "No matter what the Far Left says, #NY21 will ALWAYS stand for, salute and honor our flag," she tweeted in 2021, referring to her district. "Check out these beautiful American flags in the North Country!" Like any convert, she makes up in zeal what she lacks in pedigree. When a reporter asked her last May about the new "Ultra-MAGA" label President Biden had begun affixing to her party, she responded almost too eagerly. "I am Ultra-Maga," she said in a tone of utter seriousness. "I'm proud of it."
Ms. Stefanik writes her own tweets and is effectively her own campaign manager -- the first and often last word on messaging, scheduling and strategy. "She was always the smartest strategic mind in the room," said Anthony Pileggi, who worked on her first two campaigns. Somewhat unusually for a high-ranking lawmaker, she personally approves every piece of campaign direct mail, weighing in on the design, photos and creative content and sometimes writing the copy herself. Routine statements from her office or campaign often appear first on Breitbart, the alt-right Bible, which hypes them as "exclusives."
Since throwing in her lot with Mr. Trump, Ms. Stefanik has endorsed politicians like Sandy Smith, an unsuccessful House candidate in North Carolina who called for the arrest and execution of those responsible for the "fraud" of Mr. Trump's defeat. In May, she hosted a fund-raiser for George Santos, a pro-Trump Republican recently elected to a district in Queens and Long Island, who fabricated vast swaths of his résumé and biography. (A picture of the two still adorns Mr. Santos's Twitter profile.) The same month, Ms. Stefanik attacked "the White House, House Dems, & usual pedo grifters" for failing to address the nationwide infant-formula shortage, a seeming allusion to the QAnon mythos. In 2021, as a surge of Haitian migrants sought to cross the border into Texas, she ran a series of Facebook ads warning that Mr. Biden would "grant amnesty to 11 MILLION illegal immigrants" to "overthrow our current electorate and create a permanent liberal majority in Washington." The ads echoed a racist conspiracy theory, heavily promoted by Mr. Carlson, about a supposed Democratic plot to replace the native-born electorate with illegal immigrants.
In New York, Ms. Stefanik has allied herself firmly with the Republican Party's clamorous Trump wing. Two weeks after a young white man killed 10 people at a supermarket this past May in a largely Black neighborhood in Buffalo, accusing his victims of seeking to "ethnically replace my own people," Ms. Stefanik endorsed Carl Paladino, a developer and Trump friend running for Congress, who had suggested online that the massacre might have been a false-flag operation meant to help Democrats "revoke the 2nd amendment." (Within days of Ms. Stefanik's endorsement, audio surfaced of Mr. Paladino praising Adolf Hitler as "the kind of leader we need today." The congresswoman told HuffPost that his comment had been taken out of context.)
Last January, she joined the New York Young Republican Club, a longtime redoubt of Rockefeller Republicanism recently taken over by MAGA enthusiasts. In May, the club announced a partnership with the youth wing of Austria's right-wing Freedom Party, proclaiming a shared interest in "ending illegal immigration undertaken with the interest of eradicating the traditional people of a land." Guests at the club's annual holiday banquet in December included Peter Brimelow, founder of the nativist website VDare, and Jack Posobiec, a far-right commentator known for promoting the "Pizzagate" conspiracy theory. The club's president, Gavin Wax, views Ms. Stefanik's trajectory as almost inevitable. "She's really transformed," he said in an interview. "There's no point in being a moderate Republican in New York anymore."
From Harvard to the Hill
Like the Ivy-educated Republican senator Josh Hawley or Florida governor Ron DeSantis, Ms. Stefanik has succeeded in the Trump era in part by turning on the kind of people and institutions that made her.
The daughter of a prosperous Albany-area plywood distributor, she arrived at Harvard a year after the Sept. 11 attacks and immediately got involved with the university's Institute of Politics. At the institute's glass-and-brick building near the Charles River, a college freshman might brush elbows with a visiting senator, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, even a former president. "We all wanted to be around power, and we all had to decide what we were going to do with that access," said Naomi Ages, a Harvard contemporary who went on to a career in environmental law.
The institute tried, with mixed success, to weld the students' natural ambition to some notion of the public good. Ms. Stefanik fell in easily with a mostly left-leaning crowd. Four people who knew her at the time said she identified as a supporter of abortion and gay rights, though another college friend, Daniel Dunay, said in an email that "she was pro-life then, just like she is now." Friends recalled her zipping around Cambridge in a sporty BMW, an earnest and fun-loving young woman with an endearingly goofy side. "She was sort of fascinated by the glamour of politics," said Clarke Tucker, now a Democratic state lawmaker in Arkansas. "A lot of people with the I.O.P., myself included, are sort of nerds with a reverence for American institutions. I would have said the same about her, which is the most heartbreaking part of this." He added: "She was running for something from the second she got there."
A few weeks into her freshman year, she was picked to help run a weekly study group for a seminar led by Ted Sorensen, the former Kennedy speechwriter and confidant. "After that, I was hooked," she later told a Harvard newsletter. No other institution in the world, she exulted, could match the institute "in terms of exposure and having a seat at the table."
As a rising junior, she set out to run for the institute's student presidency. Institute elections were hotly contested -- Pete Buttigieg was famous in their circle for his surprise victory two years earlier -- but not particularly ideological. Ms. Stefanik and a friend named David Kaden, the polished son of a politically connected New York lawyer, decided to run together. Ms. Stefanik believed she should be at the top of the ticket, but in the end grudgingly agreed to be Mr. Kaden's vice president, a concession that left her bitter years later. Adopting a quasi-populist platform -- giving all students, not just those in leadership, keys to the I.O.P. student office -- they won overwhelmingly. Later, a friend and Harvard alumna introduced Ms. Stefanik to her boss at the White House, an official who ran President George W. Bush's domestic policy council. The day after graduation, she moved to Washington as his new assistant.
Ms. Stefanik was an adept networker in the way of many successful young Washingtonians. Older people had a tendency to see in her a younger version of themselves, and after Mr. Bush left office and her law school plans fizzled -- none of the schools she applied to accepted her -- she translated her White House connections into a succession of opportunities. With vague ideas about a revival of Mr. Bush's "compassionate conservatism" or an American version of Thatcherism, she persuaded several prominent Bush alumni to join the board of a new web magazine, named American Maggie and dedicated to promoting "new ideas, new voices, and new types of candidates." American Maggie lasted about six months, publishing a mix of syndicated columns and lightly polished essays by young conservative women in Ms. Stefanik's orbit. In 2011, she became policy director for Tim Pawlenty, the former Minnesota governor running for president as a Tea Party-friendly lunch-pail conservative. When the party nominated an altogether different candidate, the patrician ex-financier Mitt Romney, her Bush connections helped land her a job with his running mate, Mr. Ryan, an icon of the party's libertarianish wing.
After Mr. Romney lost, Ms. Stefanik was hired by a Republican National Committee task force charged with figuring out what had gone wrong. The project, known as the Republican "autopsy," would call on the party to embrace comprehensive immigration reform -- "amnesty," as it was disparaged on the right. Ms. Stefanik, who served as an editor for the task force, was "a strong advocate of including the immigration language," according to Sally Bradshaw, a task force member. "I can't recall any time where Elise argued against being bold in that document," Ms. Bradshaw said. As she recalled, Ms. Stefanik was most involved in the passages that examined how the party could attract a more diverse electorate. More inclusive messaging would not be enough, the final report argued; the party had to run more women for office. Ms. Stefanik, it turned out, had a specific kind of candidate in mind.
North Country Makeover
Running for Congress would be her first reinvention: from staff member to principal, insider to outsider, Beltway striver to North Country native. As Ms. Stefanik prepared to run in New York's sprawling, largely rural 21st Congressional District, she took a job at her family's company, Premium Plywood Products, and moved to their vacation home in the town of Willsboro, on Lake Champlain. She told friends she would play down her liberal views on abortion rights and gay marriage by casting them as settled matters. She hired Mr. Romney's media consultant, who prepared a rosy-toned introductory ad heralding her "return home to the North Country"; her campaign bio described Ms. Stefanik as "a small businesswoman who works in North Country sales, marketing and management." When one local reporter visited Willsboro for a profile, he couldn't find a single person who had either met or heard of her.
The older, overwhelmingly male political class in the district did not immediately take Ms. Stefanik seriously. The candidate and her aides felt that local news coverage of her was hostile and nitpicky. But she had an instinctive sense of how to craft a sound bite and repeat it relentlessly, embracing the slogan "new ideas and a new generation of leadership." She logged thousands of miles on the road -- she had ditched the BMW for a Ford F-150 pickup -- and boned up on local issues, like broadband internet access and tick control. When the incumbent Democrat announced his retirement in early 2014, Ms. Stefanik's main challenge was defeating his previous opponent, a self-funding businessman, in the Republican primary.
Whatever resistance she may have faced in New York, the party's national establishment, fearful of Democrats' dominance among young voters, embraced her eagerly. Billionaires threw her fund-raisers and put more than $ 1 million into super PACs backing her candidacy. Smaller checks poured in from former White House colleagues and college friends, conservatives and liberals alike. "At the time, she was everything I agreed with," said Heather Grizzle, a friend and fellow Republican from her Harvard days. "I was thrilled to help a friend who looked like she had a shot."
That fall, at the age of 30, Ms. Stefanik became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. The Institute of Politics brought her onto its board, among the ranks of the politicians and leaders she had idolized as a student. In Congress, she joined a new, more diverse crop of young Republicans; senior Republicans began to discuss her as a future House speaker. She was profiled in Glamour magazine and told CBS she had been influenced to run by reading "Lean In," the best-selling book by Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook. But she carefully turned down most national interview requests. "I wanted to make sure that my first impression to my colleagues is that I am a workhorse," she would later explain.
In private, Ms. Stefanik already seemed to be thinking ahead. Not long after the 2014 primary, according to records provided by the online forensics company DomainTools, StefanikForPresident.com was registered by Alex Skatell, the co-founder of IMGE, a political consulting firm retained by Ms. Stefanik's campaign. Within days, the records show, the firm had registered or acquired two dozen other Stefanik-themed web addresses, more than half hinting at a future bid for Senate or president. Ownership of the addresses was later hidden behind a proxy service. In 2017, local papers reported that persons unknown had registered StefanikForPresident.com and other Stefanik-related domains. At the time, a spokesman denied it had been Ms. Stefanik or anyone working for her, chalking up the scrutiny to "desperate candidates and their partisan allies."
'Supporting' the Nominee
When the congresswoman appeared in May 2021 on "War Room," Stephen K. Bannon's popular talk show, the onetime Trump consigliere prompted her to tell listeners how she had always stood by Mr. Trump's side. "People in the audience need to understand this," Mr. Bannon said: After the release of the "Access Hollywood" tape in 2016, in which the future president bragged about groping women, "you had every opportunity to run like so many of the Republican establishment did at the time."
Ms. Stefanik, then mounting her first bid for House leadership, wound up for the softball. "I will never forget campaigning in 2016 despite the media's obsessive Trump derangement syndrome," she said. She had felt the energy on the ground, had seen Mr. Trump's win coming, even if others had not. "The media didn't get it; the establishment didn't get it. I was proud to be a part of it. And I was proud to be on that ticket."
In truth, she had loathed Mr. Trump from the start. In August 2015, she told a New York radio station that he was "insulting to women," and that his candidacy would hurt the party's efforts to attract female voters. That December, at a friend's wedding in Australia, she made Mr. Trump the butt of an elaborate rehearsal dinner toast, according to four people who attended. Whipping out a red MAGA hat, she glared at the other guests with mock suspicion, warning them not to post pictures or videos of the speech online, where they might get back to her constituents. Winding up, she placed the hat on the groom, a tech entrepreneur known for his socialist politics and friendly debates with Ms. Stefanik. Everyone laughed. (Her spokesman denied it was a MAGA hat and said the toast did not mock Mr. Trump.)
Like many establishment Republicans, according to her former friends, she thought Mr. Trump was too awful and ridiculous to be taken seriously, then watched with alarm as his campaign soared. She refused to endorse anyone before the New York presidential primary that April, leading Mr. Paladino, her future ally, to denounce her as a "fraud" and "Washington elitist establishment sellout." Around that time, she returned to Cambridge for an event celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Institute of Politics. Afterward, she and a dozen of her old crowd gathered at a restaurant to catch up. Ms. Stefanik said she planned to vote for John Kasich in the primary and could not possibly vote for Mr. Trump in the general election, according to people who were there, and suggested she might write in someone else's name if he became the nominee. (Her spokesman denied that account of the dinner.)
Ms. Stefanik skipped the Republican convention that summer. When the "Access Hollywood" tape broke, she drafted a statement demanding that he drop out of the race, according to a person familiar with her decision-making process, before settling for a Facebook post calling his statements "inappropriate, offensive" and "just wrong." (Her spokesman said that it was "Never Trump Outside consultants" working on her campaign who had drafted statements calling on Mr. Trump to drop out.) A week later, after a local debate, she told the assembled news media that she was "supporting my party's nominee." Then she dashed to her vehicle as her campaign staff blocked an Albany television reporter from following her. In text messages to friends after Mr. Trump won, she expressed shock and worry, not the exultation she claims today.
Her revisionism still shocks those who have known her the longest and who remember the disdain she expressed for Mr. Trump back then. "I suspect there are a lot of Republican members of Congress who take positions on Trump that they don't hold privately, for their own political security or gain," said Mr. Tucker, the Arkansas lawmaker. "Elise is the only one I know for certain who has."
Woman in the Middle
Over Mr. Trump's first two years in office, Ms. Stefanik fought what amounted to a losing battle against her own ambition. She voted with the president most of the time but against some of his signature initiatives -- his tax cut, for example, and his attempt to free up funding for a border wall by declaring a national emergency. She co-sponsored legislation to provide a path to citizenship for "Dreamers," young immigrants brought to America as children, and registered high-toned disapproval of the president's attacks on "shithole" countries. ("Wrong and contrary to our American ideals," she wrote on Twitter.)
Her friends outside Washington would occasionally text her with praise after a tough vote. "Getting a lot of negative feedback back home," she wrote one after the wall showdown. "But also some positive. So mixed. But I feel strongly it was the right vote." She began participating in a book about millennial politicians by a Time magazine journalist, Charlotte Alter, who cast Ms. Stefanik as a rising star determined to drag her party into the 21st century. "I just think my generation doesn't want to see the extreme partisanship," she told the writer. Mike Conaway, a former Republican lawmaker from Texas who served with Ms. Stefanik on the House Intelligence Committee, described her as a diligent and hard-working member who "would ask really good questions and ask really good follow-up questions."
But according to current and former friends, she felt increasingly frustrated and lost in the House, horrified by the behavior of her harder-right colleagues and unsure of her place. As Mr. Trump's presidency unfolded, it was becoming more difficult to play the middle. Some of the high-profile issues on which she had positioned herself as a bipartisan leader -- climate action, immigration -- had little traction in the Trump era. The president's base wanted revenge, not high-minded ideas; Mr. Trump set policy by tweet, not white paper. As the 2018 midterms approached, Ms. Stefanik's campaign took on a grim, joyless air. According to friends and advisers, she seemed brittle and unhappy. No longer a novice candidate, she dictated a hyperlocal campaign, emphasizing her bipartisanship and focus on regional issues. Though Democrats took the House that fall, Ms. Stefanik won the largest margin of any Republican in New York, a seeming validation of her carefully calibrated approach. But it was bittersweet. She was a promising young lawmaker with a seat at no particular table, respected by her party's fractured establishment but viewed with suspicion by its ascendant Trump wing.
Still, the campaign had given Ms. Stefanik a glimpse of an alternate path. That August, she had appeared with Mr. Trump at Fort Drum, a major military base in her district, to mark the signing of that year's defense bill. With a Democratic wave approaching, Ms. Stefanik had fretted for weeks over whether and how she wanted him to appear, but ultimately lobbied hard for Mr. Trump's visit, according to a former White House official involved in the planning. At Fort Drum, Mr. Trump mispronounced her name -- calling her "STEF-a-nik," not for the last time -- and offered backhanded praise. "She called me so many times" that he had dodged her calls, Mr. Trump told the audience. Ms. Stefanik gave a brief speech from behind the presidential lectern, lit for television as she cited the bill's pay increase for soldiers and provisions she had written providing support for military spouses.
The day made a powerful impression, according to people who know or have worked with her. The cheering crowd was "a taste of being Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows for a day," said the former White House official, referring to two of Mr. Trump's staunchest House allies. More important, she had successfully maneuvered the power of the presidency -- even if it was his presidency -- behind a piece of her own agenda. It was a taste of the influence she had always imagined having.
In the months that followed, many people sensed her impending transformation only as a kind of withdrawal. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat serving with her on the intelligence committee, recalled that in their first years on the panel, they texted often about committee business. "She took the Russia stuff seriously for a long time," Mr. Swalwell said. "And then she just went dark."
Always a happy warrior -- someone who loved a debate and gave as good as she got -- she now seemed cornered and defensive. She felt she was taking risks in criticizing Mr. Trump, even gently. But amid the polarizing fever of the Trump presidency, longtime friends were increasingly impatient with her cautious triangulations.
In the summer of 2019, when Mr. Trump attacked the Baltimore district of a Black lawmaker as a "rat- and rodent-infested mess" and urged four Democratic lawmakers of color to "go back" to where they came from, Ms. Stefanik called his comments "denigrating and wrong" but balked at going further. "I don't believe he's a racist," she told a North Country newspaper. A week later, she received a long email from her old Harvard friend, Ms. Yearwood Young. "I've been wanting to write this email for months, but have been holding out as long as I could, hoping you would redeem yourself at some point," she wrote. "You know he is racist. It honestly disgusts me that for political purposes you will not only refuse to call it out, but to actually state that he is NOT racist."
Ms. Stefanik wrote back that afternoon. "I am so sorry that I have disappointed you," she said. She pointed out that she had among the more bipartisan records in Congress and asked her friend to respect their differences. "I know how divided this country is right now. I hear it, see it, experience it every day. I receive emails like this on a daily basis from people (including some of our college friends!) who shame me for not supporting President Trump enough," Ms. Stefanik wrote. She skirted the question of whether Mr. Trump or the things he said were racist, responding that "supporting President Trump does not make voters or people racist."
Their volley of emails took on a progressively bitter tone. Ms. Stefanik said she had been "called out by name on Fox News and radio repeatedly" after voting for "immigration reform and legal status for undocumented immigrants." She had been subject to violent threats; strangers had followed her while driving. She sounded resigned. "As long as I happen to be a Republican today," she wrote, "that is unacceptable and immoral in your mind." They never spoke again.
That October, after receiving a list of routine fact-checking queries from Ms. Alter, the Time journalist, Ms. Stefanik demanded through an aide to speak to Ms. Alter's publisher. The aide claimed that the queries reflected significant factual errors, according to emails Ms. Alter provided, but when pressed, identified only a handful of minor items, easily fixed before publication. "They were trying to use my good-faith effort to check the facts as a cudgel to stop a book they didn't want to be in anymore," Ms. Alter said. "The book aligned with her earlier image, and she was making a transformation." Just weeks later, Ms. Stefanik made her move.
'She Has Become a Star'
Among those who have known her longest, a question about Ms. Stefanik's ideological journey almost invariably draws a pause, a sigh and a theory. Even now, many former friends and associates believe that she did not, at first, intend to travel quite as far as she did. "I don't think that the plan was to become a MAGA star," Mr. Tucker said.
Indeed, through most of autumn 2019, as the intelligence committee examined allegations that Mr. Trump had threatened to withhold military aid unless Ukraine investigated Mr. Biden, she remained a minor player, attending fewer than half of the private depositions and asking questions at just two. She closely watched the Democratic presidential debates, sometimes offering, through a friend working on his campaign, unsolicited advice for Mr. Buttigieg. Even weeks later, as she publicly defended Mr. Trump, she was mulling other paths for advancement: She asked the friend whether Mr. Buttigieg might consider her for a cabinet job if he won the presidency. The friend, incredulous, told The Times the idea was never sent up the chain.
Yet as public hearings loomed that November, Ms. Stefanik lobbied for a bigger role. Like other Republicans, she felt that Democrats were abusing their power, forcing through one-sided rules for the impeachment battle. Her plan, she told one Republican friend, was to highlight the unfairness of the process. But she would not carry Mr. Trump's water. "I will never defend Trump," she said. (Her spokesman said that the notion that Ms. Stefanik had raised the idea of a cabinet job with anyone on the Buttigieg campaign was "stupid and false," and that she had never expressed reluctance about defending Mr. Trump.)
On the first day of the hearings, she led off Republican efforts to derail the hearing, attacking the panel's chairman, Representative Adam Schiff of California, for blocking Republicans from calling some witnesses. But as the hearing progressed, she did defend Mr. Trump: Addressing herself directly to the television audience, she waved away the president's efforts to pressure the Ukrainians. "For the millions of Americans viewing today, the two most important facts are the following," she said. "No. 1, Ukraine received the aid; No. 2, there was, in fact, no investigation into Biden." When the committee reconvened two days later, Ms. Stefanik again led the attack. With theatrical interjections, deliberately breaking the Democrats' rules, she lured Mr. Schiff into calling his young female colleague out of order. "What is the interruption for this time?" she demanded.
On the left, Ms. Stefanik became an instant target of hatred. Hollywood celebrities and liberal Twitter influencers attacked her relentlessly, dubbing her "Trashy Stefanik" and circulating a doctored picture of her supposedly giving the finger to a photographer during the hearings. In a clumsily sexist tweet, ABC's Matthew Dowd suggested she had been elected only because she was a woman. But Fox ate up her performance, featuring clips through prime time. Mr. Trump loved it. "I know a lot about stardom," he said on "Fox and Friends" the following week. "This young woman from upstate New York -- she has become a star."
Ms. Stefanik's Republican friend, to whom she had pledged not to carry Mr. Trump's water, was not surprised. He had watched many Republican politicians grapple with the political incentives of Trumpism. All her life, Ms. Stefanik had streamlined herself for success; finally she had found the engine of her ascent. The farther she turned the dial, the more power and influence she would have. "So then the question is, what do you do with that dial?" said the friend. "You can say, 'I can embrace it without going full MAGA."' Ms. Stefanik chose differently. "She just said, 'Wow.' She cranked the dial. I don't think she arrived at this issue set totally disingenuously."
'I've Chosen My Values'
As the positive reviews rolled in, Ms. Stefanik seized the opportunity. On the day of the second impeachment hearing, her team activated a new account on WinRed, the small-donor platform set up by Trump campaign veterans. She raised more in grass-roots contributions in a week than she had over the entire rest of her congressional career, according to a Times analysis of campaign finance records. By the end of the first week of hearings, her team had prepared to unveil a new impeachment-themed fund-raising site, FightSchiff.com, and set out to have her booked on Fox to plug it.
Ms. Stefanik marveled to friends at the flood of money. Contributions from her leadership PAC to other Republicans would quadruple by the end of 2020. With Mr. Trump's blessing, she could tap into a nationwide base of MAGA fans. Out of roughly $ 4 million she raised on WinRed this election cycle through late October 2022, just 4 percent came from her own district, according to a Times analysis of campaign finance records.
Ever her own best adviser, Ms. Stefanik dictated the tactics and message. As she milked the MAGA base for money and visibility, she began articulating a new, almost passive conception of her role as congresswoman, in which her job was to mirror her constituents, not take principled votes they might dislike. In 2014, her defenders have argued, her district wanted a Bush-style Republican; in the Trump era, it wanted a Trump-style Republican. "There's no shift," said Mr. Pileggi, the former campaign aide. Who could say she was wrong if the voters said she was right? The discredited gatekeepers of the mainstream media? The small papers back home that fewer and fewer people read? Asked in a recent interview whether she had chosen her ambition over her values, she simply avoided the question. "I've chosen my values," she said. "And I've chosen my constituents."
She moved quickly into Mr. Trump's circle, readily accepting the compromises it entailed. In spring 2020, she flew with the president on Air Force One to witness the SpaceX rocket launch from Cape Canaveral, Fla. Aboard the plane, according to a former White House official who was there, the president made a derogatory comment about the sex life of one of his most loyal and senior female aides. Ms. Stefanik had once criticized Mr. Trump's demeaning comments toward women; now she simply plastered a smile on her face. "No one said anything. Neither did I," the former official recalled. "It was a sign that she knew who he was." Ms. Stefanik's spokesman denied the account, saying it "never happened."
In public, however, Ms. Stefanik's new political self was most obvious on Mr. Trump's favorite social media platform, where she began to favor his random capitalizations and conspicuous exclamation points. In the years since his first impeachment hearing, she has attacked political opponents or journalists as "sick" or "sickening" more than three dozen times -- language she had never before used on Twitter. She edited away parts of her old online persona that might grate against the new. As the 2020 elections approached, according to a Times analysis of Twitter data collected by ProPublica, Ms. Stefanik deleted a pair of tweets from that March praising Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the public face of the federal Covid response. "America ❤️s Dr. Fauci!" she had written. In 2021, with Dr. Fauci firmly established as a right-wing punching bag, she expressed a different view. "Fire Fauci," she tweeted. "Save Christmas!"
After Mr. Trump's election defeat, as he fomented a deluge of lies and conspiracy theories about cheating and voter fraud, Ms. Stefanik quickly fell in line. Mr. Trump had made his election lies a litmus test for fellow Republicans, and Ms. Stefanik was unwilling to fail it, even as election officials and judges dismissed or refuted almost every claim made by the president or his legal team. Repeating a string of already debunked assertions, she claimed that local officials had counted the votes of dead people, or tossed out procedures intended to prevent fraud, or illegally counted late-arriving votes. Having lied to her own constituents, fanning their fears of a rigged election, she then claimed their suspicions as a casus belli. "Tens of millions of Americans are rightly concerned that the 2020 election featured unprecedented voting irregularities," she said in an open letter to her district on the morning of Jan 6.
That evening, after the Trump-inspired mob was cleared from the Capitol, she joined other Republicans to vote against certifying electors from Pennsylvania. The next day, she got a text from Mr. Tucker, the Arkansas lawmaker and Harvard friend. "I cannot put into words how disappointed I am in you," he wrote. She had squandered a "historic opportunity to fundamentally strengthen our country and democracy," he told her. "You've done this all for, what exactly?" Disgusted, he joined hundreds of other Harvard alumni and students on a petition for Ms. Stefanik's removal from the Institute of Politics board. So did Ms. Grizzle, her fellow Republican, who had lived most of the year in Pennsylvania: One of the ballots Ms. Stefanik had tried to invalidate was her own. "You can't promote democracy if you're throwing out people's votes," Ms. Grizzle said.
A few days later, the dean of the Harvard Kennedy School, which oversees the institute, asked Ms. Stefanik to step aside. When she refused, he announced her removal. She had disqualified herself, the dean said in a statement, through repeated false statements about the election. Ms. Stefanik responded with the kind of bristling performance her former friends had come to expect. Her alma mater had decided to "cave to the woke Left," she said; getting kicked off the board was a "badge of honor."
A Fall and an Ascent
A few weeks after the insurrection, House Republicans met to consider removing Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, then the party's highest-ranking woman in Congress, from her job as conference chair. In the two previous leadership contests, it was Ms. Stefanik herself who had stood before colleagues to nominate Ms. Cheney, once calling her a "huge asset in the role." But Ms. Cheney had now voted for Mr. Trump's second impeachment, infuriating not only Trump allies but a broader range of Republican lawmakers, who complained that she had made their party look divided. Days after the vote, Politico reported that Ms. Stefanik had "privately signaled" her interest in replacing her.
That February, Ms. Cheney's colleagues voted to keep her in the job. But as Ms. Cheney continued to speak out against Mr. Trump, the woman who had remade her principles to fit her ambition set out to depose the one risking career suicide in service of hers. Though Ms. Stefanik had a far more liberal voting record than the woman she wanted to replace, she worked both sides, making clear she would neither embarrass Republicans who had cowered before Mr. Trump's election lies nor anger supporters who insisted on believing them. Her argument, as one Republican member recalled it: "I'm a woman, I'm young, I'm reasonable. I like Liz, but we need to quit focusing on Jan. 6." Mr. Trump's ringing endorsement that May sealed the deal. Ms. Cheney was out, and Ms. Stefanik was in.
It became harder, then, for her to reconcile the identity she said she hadn't abandoned with the power she had finally grasped. She dropped her support for the Equality Act, a bipartisan bill aimed at extending housing and employment anti-discrimination rules to gay, lesbian and transgender people, and pulled her name from another Republican-backed gay-rights bill, known as the Fairness for All Act, saying she now had "serious concerns on how this bill would impact society." (She recently voted in favor of a bipartisan bill mandating federal recognition for same-sex marriages.) Her voting score from the conservative group Heritage Action was a squishy 24 percent at the end of 2018; she currently rates a stalwart 86.
She has repeatedly voted against spending bills championed by Mr. Biden and the Democrats, then taken credit for the money those same bills delivered back home. Last March, her press office alerted upstate reporters that Ms. Stefanik had secured $ 205,000 for job training in Warren County, though a news release from her Washington office, quoting the congresswoman, proclaimed that she could not support "Speaker Pelosi's bill," which was "drafted in the dead of night."
The further Ms. Stefanik traveled into Mr. Trump's world, the deeper she seemed to dig in. She hadn't changed; her former friends had. They were out of touch, driven mad by hatred of Mr. Trump. That spring, Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, a fellow Harvard graduate and her Democratic colleague on the Armed Services Committee, approached her on the House floor. Both elected in 2014, they often had lunch together at the Capitol, and had mutual friends outside Washington. Speaking carefully, he told her that people were worried about the course she had set herself on, Mr. Moulton recalled. Ms. Stefanik lashed out, demanding to know which of their friends had talked to him. She mocked him, saying that some of the same people had asked her what Mr. Moulton thought he was doing when he ran for president the previous year.
He tried to get up and leave, but she pulled him back down, pressing her case. Her former friends had no idea what real Americans thought, Ms. Stefanik told him. They didn't know anything about the district she represented.
"But these people know you, Elise," Mr. Moulton replied. "And now they feel like they don't even recognize you."
The Price of Loyalty
"What happened to the red wave, congresswoman?"
The day after her party's midterm underperformance, even the normally friendly hosts on "Fox and Friends" had questions for Ms. Stefanik. In the weeks leading to Election Day, she had predicted nothing less than a "red tsunami." But around the country, Mr. Trump's handpicked candidates for the Senate and other offices went down to defeat; those he had endorsed in close House races ran significantly behind Republicans he had not, hampered in part by voters' revulsion at the extreme rhetoric he had normalized in Republican circles. Fewer than a third of the female House candidates Ms. Stefanik had endorsed through her leadership PAC made it through the general election. Republicans will soon take control of the House with one of the slimmest margins in history; the party's House leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, has already been forced to cut deals with the most extreme members of his caucus to keep his would-be speakership alive. Like the party more broadly, House Republicans cannot yet afford to banish those most responsible for their quandary.
But as other Republicans questioned how to wean their party off Mr. Trump, Ms. Stefanik issued her pre-emptive endorsement of his all-but-announced re-election campaign. In some respects, she had little choice: Ms. Stefanik is arguably more dependent on Mr. Trump's patronage than any other Republican leader, and his team soon made clear that he expected such an endorsement from anyone he was supporting for a leadership job. Two weeks after her re-election as conference chair, when Mr. Trump dined at Mar-a-Lago with the rapper Kanye West and the young MAGA commentator Nick Fuentes -- two guests with a history of antisemitic or racist statements -- Ms. Stefanik said nothing. Nor did she have anything to say publicly when Mr. Trump, citing stories about how Twitter had handled moderation decisions during the 2020 election, suggested "termination" of the Constitution might be an appropriate remedy.
When Congress reconvenes, many of the younger, more Trump-critical Republicans who joined the House alongside Ms. Stefanik eight years ago will be gone. So will all but two of the Republicans who voted to impeach him. Some in Congress believe that if Mr. McCarthy cannot corral the votes to make himself speaker, Ms. Stefanik could offer herself up as a compromise candidate.
Yet her position may be more precarious than it appears. Unwilling to acknowledge that her politics have changed, she has never offered MAGA die-hards a persuasive conversion story, leaving behind lingering suspicion. "One thing I've heard consistently from pro-Trump members is that the 180 that she pulled was just so jarring," said one veteran Republican lobbyist who is in touch with a wide array of Republican lawmakers.
Among her fellow Republicans, according to Republican lawmakers, Hill staff and lobbyists, Ms. Stefanik has a reputation for being both diligent in advancing the party's message and unabashedly transactional in amassing chits of support for her own climb up the ladder. But her campaign donations and endorsements have given her support that may be more broad than deep. For much of the spring and summer, while serving as conference chair, she quietly tested the waters for promotion to the next highest-ranking House job, that of Republican whip. As the race grew more crowded, however, Ms. Stefanik found herself without a clear constituency for the position. The party's remaining moderates no longer saw her as one of them, and its right wing preferred a more consistent conservative. Only when another House member announced his interest in succeeding her as conference chair did Ms. Stefanik finally commit to running for another term in her old job.
News stories about the upcoming presidential campaign still mention Ms. Stefanik as a rising star who might join a Trump ticket in 2024 -- a political pole vault that would carry her, finally, to the very top of the Republican Party. But within the president's inner circle, according to two people close to Mr. Trump, stories casting Ms. Stefanik as a potential running mate are regarded as clumsy plants by her own team, and inspire bemusement and mockery. Mr. Trump liked her, they said, and liked watching her defend him. But even he didn't trust her.
