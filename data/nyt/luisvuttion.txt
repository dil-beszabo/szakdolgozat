Full text: The holiday shopping season is hitting its apex. And do you know what I, a longtime fashion editor, will not be buying my loved ones this year? Big-name luxury fashion. I'd sooner set my eyebrows on fire.
Why am I betraying the industry to which I've dedicated the better part of the past 20 years of my life, you might wonder? Let me tell you a story.
When, for the fall 2023 season, Marc Jacobs reissued the runway-show version of his Kiki boots -- a sought-after, supple-leather style that I'd been lusting after since their 2016 debut -- I found a way to squeeze them into my budget. I'd had a tumultuous few months, and I figured I'd treat myself to something I'd treasure forever. Something that would last.
They did not. The right heel cap fell off after a handful of wears, revealing a flimsy plastic cavern. I got it replaced, only to have a four-inch platform base snap off like a rotting tree limb days later. Timber! Two passers-by heaved me up, and I limped home, barefoot. In February, I demanded a refund, which I promptly put toward much-needed physical therapy.
My experience sums up everything that's gone wrong with what once served as semiotic shorthand for the good life. In recent years, luxury of all kinds has become obscenely, disgracefully, inconceivably costly. And the price hikes we've seen are steeper than what inflation would dictate. What's worse? As costs climb, quality hasn't. In fact, it's largely declined.
"Luxury is in chaos," said Gill Linton, a fashion and marketing expert and a co-founder of the luxury vintage platform Byronesque.
I'd go a step further. Luxury is in a death spiral. After a decade of nearly unfettered growth, the sector is bombing across the globe. Analysts point to less-affluent buyers reining in their spending and slowing demand in China. I believe there's another culprit: a growing realization that many luxury houses have broken the principles that made them so successful. These hoity-toity brands, which cheapened their essence and eviscerated their desirability with down-market celebrity partnerships, licensing deals and influencer advertising, have no one to blame but themselves.
This started at the source of so many modern woes: social media. For those not glued to TikTok or "The Kardashians," social media, helped along by reality TV, has instigated a frenetic game of one-upmanship in which top social-media content makers aim to project wealth while outdoing themselves and their competition. This means flaunting luxury goods in posts that are then spread widely by algorithms. Kyle Richards, a cast member of "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills," has become infamous for hitting the gym with a difficult-to-get Hermès Birkin bag -- which costs anywhere from five figures to hundreds of thousands of dollars -- dangling from her arm.
At the same time, the rich were getting richer -- and more people were joining them. According to Swiss bank UBS, there were 7.64 million millionaires in the United States in 2000. By 2023, we saw that number nearly triple.
For those who aren't comfortably in the millionaire class, technology offers a solution. The exploding popularity of financing apps such as Klarna and Afterpay -- online lending services that allow users to break payments up into installments -- has ushered in a whole new era of buy now, pay later. It's stigma-free layaway for nearly any item. Nobody has to know, and you get the product upfront.
Suddenly, brands accustomed to catering to a select few found themselves pursued by a surfeit of less discerning customers -- some literally children -- seeking a status boost for their social media profiles. Meanwhile, the platforms continue to both stoke class anxieties and offer a seemingly unlimited amount of data on what to want next. Confronted by hordes, companies tried preserving their images the one way they knew how: jacking up prices. In doing so, they followed the longstanding Veblen goods principle. Derived from the economist Thorstein Veblen's "The Theory of the Leisure Class," written in 1899, it states that demand for luxury goods will actually increase as their prices increase, because such hikes thin the herds and make scarce goods that much more desirable.
Which prices have skyrocketed? The better question is which haven't.
From October 2019 to April 2024, the cost of Prada's popular Galleria Saffiano bag increased 111 percent. In the same period, the cost of Louis Vuitton's canvas Speedy bag doubled, and Gucci's Marmont small matelassé shoulder bag went up by 75 percent. Chanel is particularly notorious: Its iconic medium 2.55 leather flap bag, which cost $ 5,800 in 2019, will now set you back $ 10,800 -- and is increasingly the subject of quality complaints.
What about that perfect exotic backdrop to show off your new goods? A thousand bucks for a night in a normal hotel room, once unheard-of, is surprisingly common. Rooms at the sought-after Amangiri resort in Utah started at around $ 1,800 a night in 2018. Now they start at $ 3,509. Jaclyn Sienna India, the founder of a travel and lifestyle company that caters to individuals and families with a minimum net worth of $ 100 million, notes that the prix fixe menu at the exclusive Ibiza restaurant Sublimotion was about $ 1,675 a head in 2022. Today, she said, it's $ 2,380.
Under the Veblen goods principle, shoppers should view luxury brands' higher prices as a sign that the goods are precious and hard to obtain. The problem is that neither of those is the case.
Luxury has become nearly ubiquitous. Open Instagram, and everyone has a Louis Vuitton Speedy or a Chanel Boy Bag or some other instantly recognizable four-figure-plus purse from a mainstream luxury label. Some of that comes from the rise of resale (people disposing of their used luxury wares, usually at deep discounts) or dupes (similar-looking copies that trade for far less). And a growing number are superfakes -- highly convincing counterfeits that seemingly offer similar quality for a fraction of the cost.
On top of all of this, some luxury purveyors also began expanding their product categories and selling overstock via off-price outlets. Boutiques that were once decadent salons offering fittings to clients while they sipped champagne are now tourist destinations for the rich and the upper middle class, trading in wallets and key chains, which, despite their comical price tags, are among the cheapest options. We are mere minutes away from a Chanel- and Gucci-packed outlet store popping up in a midtier strip mall near you.
For a while, it worked. After the pandemic, newly minted millionaires were eager to spend and show off. The Chanels and Vuittons jacked up prices "so the 'wrong' people stop buying," said Erez Yoeli, a research scientist at M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Management. But part "of the pressure in the marketplace comes from the fact that you do have to be legitimately better," he said. "And if you're not, you're going to suffer the consequences."
They weren't better. Ms. India found that service at many top-tier hotels nose-dived during the pandemic, partly from staffing shortages, and has yet to recover. And how about those $ 10,000 handbags? Taleen Akopyan, who with her husband has worked as a cobbler and a leather restoration expert for the past four decades, said her business has shifted from bags that are 50 years old and still in good shape to brand-new Chanels, Louis Vuittons and Guccis that need help after a few wears. "There's definitely a quality deterioration across the board," she said.
It had to end. By many measures, the luxury market is in free-fall.
LVMH and Kering, which owns brands including Gucci, Balenciaga and Yves Saint Laurent, reported losses this year. Same goes for Burberry; Richemont, which owns Alaïa, Cartier and Chloé; and Capri Holdings, owner of Michael Kors, Versace and Jimmy Choo. A fall study from the management consulting company Bain predicted that 2024 would be the first year of luxury slowdown since the 2008 financial crisis (excluding the pandemic). Certainly the luxury sector tends to be one of the first hit by a slowing economy. But many of the reasons for today's problems the companies brought on themselves.
Some brands are responding by dropping prices, which risks turning a luxury label into a line that's carried by outlet malls and desired by virtually no one. Investors shouldn't have lauded Burberry's new C.E.O., Joshua Schulman, when in November he announced that among other adjustments, the brand would be reducing the prices of its handbags.
Perhaps the most egregious sign of the problem is the fact that luxury goods are winding up on the shelves of discount outlet stores. Dumping excess product in less-than-glamorous locations can be so destructive to a brand's perception that some companies used to set excess product on fire to avoid such a fate. And yet, according to Bain, at the end of 2023, that's exactly where about 13 percent of all luxury goods were purchased, compared with 5 percent a decade earlier.
Some brands are trying to hold the line. In a July interview, LVMH's chief financial officer, Jean-Jacques Guiony, implied that price increases won't "end just because the aspirational customers are a little under pressure." Fun fact: LVMH's fashion and leather-goods sales did a 5 percent belly flop in 2024's third quarter. So perhaps pressure isn't so much the problem as subpar, overpriced goods, like the $ 2,816 Christian Dior bags that were discovered to have been made in an Italian sweatshop for around $ 57.
What happened to these once-prestigious bastions of craftsmanship and fabulousness? The eponymous founder of Louis Vuitton was born into a family of artisans in 1821 and dedicated his life to studying and perfecting trunk making. Chanel was founded by Coco Chanel in the early 20th century and brilliantly designed sporty wares for women that freed them from corsets. Christian Dior invented the New Look in 1947, an immaculately designed, hyperfeminine silhouette that was a return to belle epoque glamour after the austerity of World War II. These brands and their peers long upheld the traditions and standards of their founders -- until they didn't. When short-term bottom lines matter more than history and heritage, corners get cut, the soul gets snuffed out, and the product becomes trash in a fancy box.
An exception is Hermès. The company has raised the cost of its Birkin 30 bag in Togo leather just 15 percent from 2019 to 2024, taking it from $ 10,900 to $ 12,500. That said, many claim you may have to spend a great amount on other Hermès items to "earn" the privilege of buying one.
Like my sad Kiki boots, much of old-school luxury -- the kind that was so glamorous, lush and exquisite that everyone understood it, many craved it and few could have it -- is beyond repair. Once-revered establishments that prided themselves on craftsmanship, service and cultivating a discerning and loyal customer base have become mass-marketing machines that are about as elegant and exclusive as the Times Square M&M's store.
Today, instant gratification, profit and appearances are more desirable than substance, depth or intrinsic worth. And while the decline of "luxury" might not seem like the end of the world (especially with so many apocalypse-adjacent events unfolding), its fall represents a deeper decay that's gnawing at so much of our existence -- from education, media and literature to interpersonal relationships and quality of life.
But back to shopping. Now is the perfect time to seek skilled, independent craftspeople and designers who remain uncompromised by the luxury conglomerates' production quotas and politics.
If something is obviously awful and obscenely expensive, don't buy it. Don't tout it on Instagram. Tell the manager you know it was mid. I certainly won't be dipping my toes into any Marc Jacobs platforms again. One bruised tailbone was terrible enough. I'll happily tell you all about it.

Handbags Go on a Charm Offensive: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Bag charms -- or key chains by another name -- have begun to rival holiday ornaments in their variety and as a form of self-expression.
It's easy enough to picture a blue button-up shirt, a pleated mini skirt and ballet flats on a person. Now imagine the outfit on a bag.
That ensemble is one of the many ways people can dress up a handbag with bag charms, items used to accessorize another accessory. As they have proliferated, charms have started to rival holiday ornaments in their variety and availability.
The dangly products are sold at a range of retailers, including mall chains like Claire's and luxury department stores like Bergdorf Goodman. They take the forms of fruits, vegetables, animals, robots, shopping bags -- even handbags. For example: Louis Vuitton's Speedy Monogram charm, a 2.4-inch-wide version of the brand's popular Speedy bag. At $ 815, it is one of many charms that cost more than some handbags themselves.
Others include Miu Miu's leather charms resembling a shirt, a micro-mini skirt and ballet flats (all $ 625 each), as well as the label's cord-and-nylon charm ( $ 440), which, as noted in several TikTok videos, evokes a lanyard made at summer camp. The luxury brand Loewe also sells charms like a fluffy felt corgi ( $ 550), a leather pea pod containing resin peas ( $ 490) and a bundle of asparagus made with beaded felt ( $ 790).
"All the brands seem to be jumping on it," said Lori Hirshleifer, 65, whose family has owned and operated the store Hirshleifers in Manhasset, N.Y., for several generations.
"I see people around me and the store and the area adorning their bag," Ms. Hirshleifer added, describing fascination with bag charms as "almost contagious." She has not been immune to their appeal: Her collection includes charms from Loewe, Chrome Hearts and Prada, some of which she has shown off on social media.
Prices for other charms may be more in line with what some might expect to pay for key chains by another name. At Bloomingdale's, the available styles include a miniature version of the department store's Little Brown Bag ( $ 12); a peach from Maison de Sabré ( $ 69); and a heart-shaped quilted coin purse from Kurt Geiger London ( $ 65).
Bag charms have resonated with customers of the department store who are "craving a way to show their personal style," said Marissa Galante Frank, the fashion director for accessories and beauty at Bloomingdale's.
She added that interest in the charms has risen on the heels of now-waning trends like quiet luxury, which prescribed that clothes and accessories be simple and staid. As Ms. Galante Frank put it, charms are a "way to make a more serious handbag feel unique."
Justine Clenquet, 33, an accessories designer in Lille, France, offered a similar explanation for the interest her bag charms, which include puffy hearts and teddy bears (both $ 76). She said her customers skew younger and "prefer to have something more classic for a bag and more playful for the charms" -- like her current best-selling style, a large silver bellybutton barbell ( $ 65) -- "because you can remove it if you don't like it anymore."
Though newly fashionable, bag charms are not new. For decades, Hermès has been associated with the baubles largely because of Jane Birkin, who was known to adorn her namesake Birkin bags with stickers and key chains. (The current charm selection at Bloomingdale's includes vintage Hermés styles like a multicolor pony for $ 650.)
Online, the term "Birkinfy" has become shorthand for Ms. Birkin's way of accessorizing handbags. Chloe Jackson, a 32-year-old tattoo artist, learned about bag charms after encountering the term on Pinterest.
On Thursday, Ms. Jackson was browsing the selection of charms at Anthropologie in Rockefeller Center while visiting New York from Las Vegas, where she lives. The store is one of several Anthropologie locations with a stand-alone display for bag charms, like a carabiner with faux pearl accents ( $ 28) and themed styles for cities including Nashville and London (both $ 32).
Hanging from Ms. Jackson's leopard print bag were a wolf tail and a doll she had made with her daughter. "I'm super into oddities and creepy things," she said, explaining that the items decorating her bag "add a personal touch."
Since Anthropologie started selling bag charms in August, they have become some of the most searched for items on its website, said Jessica Irick Peek, the company's general merchandise manager for accessories. She added that Anthropologie sold more than 10,000 charms between August and October.
"People are looking to make things unique for themselves," Ms. Irick Peek said.
For those with little time to look for bag charms who are willing to pay a premium, certain brands offer ways to streamline the process. Balenciaga is selling bags that come adorned with various charms (starting at $ 4,600), as is Prada (starting at $ 3,750).

To Understand Luxury Economics, Study Psychology: [Style Desk]

Full text: The exorbitant cost of luxury fashion has left us out in the cold, wondering who can sustain this market?
Historically, luxury fashion brands have enjoyed strong pricing power, meaning that they can apply considerable increases without necessarily losing customers. But in 2023, price tags hit eye-watering highs -- and there has been no sign of the trend slowing.
According to the data company EDITED, average luxury prices are up by 25 percent since 2019. Many brands attribute their increases to everything from inflation and the balancing out of regional price disparities to the fallout of the pandemic and impact of the war in Ukraine. But for many luxury fashion brands, the uptick has been taking place over a longer timeline.
Take Chanel, where handbag prices have more than doubled since 2016. The auction house Sotheby's found a classic 2.55 Chanel bag sold for around $ 1,650 in 2008. In 2023, that figure from Chanel is closer to $ 10,200. (If the cost had risen in line with inflation over the 15-year period, it would be expected to cost $ 2,359). This week, Pharrell Williams, the men's creative director at Vuitton, unveiled the label's new Millionaire Speedy Bag. The crocodile hide bag is made-to-order, costs a cool million and has a distinctly Scrooge McDuck aura.
"Industrywide, the pricing has gotten truly absurd," the influencer Bryan Yambao noted in an Instagram post this week when discussing a $ 6,000 woolen Miu Miu coat. "I do think this is a good time for most brands to lower their prices."
In the past year there have been signs that so-called aspirational customers, who buy entry-level luxury products like cosmetics and spirits, have curbed their spending. Middle class professionals who once saved up for a luxury investment handbag or coat have been aggressively priced out.
So who is spending $ 3,000 on a knit hat shaped like a duck from the British brand Burberry? What about $ 24,500 on a vicuña jacket by Brunello Cucinelli? Or $ 1,250 on a white cotton shirt by The Row?
The answer is the 1 percent, obviously (or those willing to incur credit card debt). Luca Solca, an analyst for Bernstein, estimates that the top 5 percent of luxury clients now account for more than 40 percent of sales for most luxury goods brands. As wealth inequality increases globally, luxury brands are doubling down on an ever smaller slice of their clientele. Will this strategy work? Or is there a backlash brewing which might force the luxury pricing bubble to burst?
The below discussion among Style journalists has been edited and condensed.
Elizabeth Paton To many people, luxury price tags have always been absurd and almost amoral. And prices in luxury fashion keep going up, and up, and up. Does it matter to customers?
Vanessa Friedman The high prices of Phoebe Philo's new line certainly struck a nerve, despite the fact they are actually at the lower end of the luxury market. It made me wonder why it was the Philo line that sparked such outrage.
Stella Bugbee It's rare to see a collection for the first time and be simultaneously confronted by the prices. We go to fashion shows and admire or critique them on a conceptual level, but often what we see on the runway doesn't make it to the store. It was also more expensive than the old Celine.
VF Although, almost everything "luxury" (including new Celine) is now more expensive than old Celine. Also, perhaps, because Phoebe has become such a mythic, fashion-savior-of-women, rightly or wrongly, and we were waiting for years for her line, a fantasy arose in which she also saved more women by making her clothes available to more people. For some of her fans these prices almost seem like a betrayal.
EP The balance between accessibility and exclusivity has always been a tricky one for luxury fashion brands, especially as the sector expanded into new markets. Now, many people who might have treated themselves with a bag are tightening their belts.
VF Well, the 1 percent are the target market for high fashion. The rest of us are left with perfume and lipstick.
EP Right, but a certain type of professional used to feel like they could save for a special piece. A Burberry raincoat. A Gucci handbag. Those are out of range for nearly everyone now.
Guy Trebay Don't forget about credit card debt, which the Federal Reserve currently pegs at over $ 1 trillion.
SB The resale economy has also changed the calculus. You can get all of those things secondhand, not long after they sell for full price.
EP And if they are hot enough items, they can sell for even more than full price! Like an Hermès Birkin for example.
VF There's a sort of warring imperative here between people who see it as a badge of honor not to buy full price and those who belong to the very tiny club that can. Economics are involved, but as much as anything, it's also psychology.
EP Resale is also a good barometer for whether pricing strategies are working. Chanel and Hermès drive the top of the resale market. More trend-driven high-fashion houses -- who have been raising their prices -- don't fare so well. If there is a market correction, it will be more directed toward brands where people take a loss on products they want to sell on the secondary market.
Jessica Testa I know of at least one resale website, the Paris-based ReSee, where Philo-era Celine is the third most popular brand, below Chanel and Hermès. And there are several independent sellers on Instagram dedicated exclusively to selling Philo-era Celine designs, fetching prices above what they cost at retail 10 years ago. There are people who spend years hunting eBay for one specific product in their size.
VF Which brings me back to Phoebe Philo's current scarcity model: We don't even know how much of any piece they produced (the company wouldn't say) but the message is the market will bear the prices, since the products are sold out. We think because it is more expensive, it has more value.
GT This is the stuff for which Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel. Subjects shown two identical cashmere sweaters, one at a far higher price, inevitably chose the more costly of the two. His point was that we don't think. We act irrationally.
VF I go back to the idea of betrayal. Because so many women relate to Phoebe Philo as a person, or at least the idea of Phoebe and what her work once represented, they felt excluded or ill-served by the pricing of her new line. They cared deeply about what she was going to make, and then it seemed as if she didn't really care at all about including them.
EP Also that Phoebe -- and the powers that be in luxury -- spent a considerable period courting aspirational audiences. It's just now they're pulling the drawbridge up. Fashion is always at risk of looking out of touch with the wider world, and certain items that seem to have gone viral on social in recent months -- like the Burberry duck hat -- triggered particular wrath, more so than usual.
VF Burberry is also selling a $ 21,000 viscose dress with a Burberry knight riding across the front.
GT Better at that point to pin dollar bills to your chest.
EP Speaking of dollars, a quarter of a trillion them have been wiped off the value of Europe's seven biggest luxury businesses since April, and sales are generally down across most fashion groups. That is the aspirational middle class stepping away from the credit card machine.
JT My pet peeve is when high-end brands collaborate with mass-market brands and yet the pricing doesn't even meet in the middle -- it's still $ 900.
EP Like the recent Banana Republic collaboration with Peter Do.
GT And that's relatively new. By contrast, there were the wonderful and completely affordable collabs Jil Sander, Tomas Maier and others did with Uniqlo.
JT Guy Trebay may have complimented my Clare Waight Keller Uniqlo bag a mere two days ago, folks.
EP The collabs do occasionally have some treasures!
VF In a sense they give the luxury brands an excuse for their pricing, because they can say, "Well, but we did this or that mass market collab."
EP I agree and I don't think we will see this approach by the luxury powers changing anytime soon. The bubble doesn't seem to be bursting -- yet.

Full text: Since the 2002 release of Louis Vuitton's Tambour, the sturdy timepiece named for its drum-shaped case (tambour is French for "drum") had remained relatively the same. But in 2022, when Jean Arnault, 24, the youngest son of Bernard Arnault, the chief executive officer and chairman of the LVMH luxury conglomerate, became the French house's director of watches, he arrived with a plan: to build what he's called a "real boutique horology brand," partly by discontinuing about 130 existing watches and redesigning some of the classics. One of the division's first big moves under his leadership is the release of this new Tambour -- a slimmer, more streamlined sports watch for men and women -- which was developed for over two years by the team at La Fabrique du Temps, Louis Vuitton's workshop in Geneva. The case of the watch, which is now available in five versions, including stainless steel, 18-karat yellow gold or 18-karat rose gold in combination with either a gray, blue or brown dial, no longer connects to the bracelet with statement lugs; instead, the two integrate in a way that's nearly as subtle as the 12 letters of "Louis Vuitton," each corresponding to an hour's position, engraved into the side of the sandblasted bezel. The goal was to make a famously bold timepiece thin enough to slip under the cuff of a dress shirt -- an inconspicuous symbol of luxury in keeping with the times.

The New Rose Kitchen
On a steamy summer Monday in Paris's 11th Arrondissement, the chef Rose Chalalai Singh, 43, is unloading a suitcase of cooking equipment at her new private dining space, Rose Kitchen. The kitchen is still in its final stages of refurbishment but, says Singh, "I can cook anywhere as long as there's water and gas."
That attitude has served her well on her unconventional path through the culinary world. After moving to Paris from her native Bangkok in 2009, she opened a small Thai grocery called Ya Lamaï in the Marais. At first, the shop offered only a few takeout options, but her customers wanted more, as well as a place to sit. Eventually, Ya Lamaï relocated to a bigger space and became a full-scale restaurant, with Singh, who'd never worked in a professional kitchen, as the head chef. In 2017, she left the role to focus on her catering company (Hermès and a number of Paris galleries are clients). Four years later, when a spot became available in the historic covered market Marché des Enfants Rouges, she opened a home-style Thai cafe (also called Rose Kitchen) that quickly became a favorite of the art and fashion crowds. But Singh struggled with the nonstop schedule and closed the place after 18 months. "Restaurants aren't my thing anymore, because I love to travel," she says.
At her new space -- in a vine-covered cobblestone mews off a quiet block -- she'll focus on invitation-only events, leaving herself plenty of time for research and sourcing trips to places like Majorca, where she found the painted pottery that today is laid out on the long communal table that accommodates 30. Diners will have views of the open kitchen, and of the shelves of kitchenware and ingredients, some for sale, like olive oil, homemade jams and colorful Japanese table linens. Upstairs is a tatami room for tea ceremonies, where Singh will host tea masters visiting from Japan.
While Singh's food has always had Thai roots, she incorporates influences from her various journeys: Papaya salad might come accompanied by lemongrass and bay leaf-stuffed guinea hen and her hybrid dumpling-ravioli. Or she'll collaborate with her catering partner the chef Petra Lindbergh on a South Indian curry with shrimp, coconut milk and tamarind. No matter what's on the menu, though, "I don't doubt myself," she says. "I just do my job." Her only request is that guests come hungry. "We never make it a party," she says. "This is an eating place." -- Lauren Joseph

The Thing: David Webb Brings an Archival Sketch to Life
In 1948, David Webb, a debonair jeweler originally from Asheville, N.C., opened a shop and atelier on West 46th Street in Manhattan. Possessing a savant's skill when it came to anticipating -- and adapting to -- the zeitgeist, he became a favorite of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Elizabeth Taylor, both of whom loved his work. In the 1960s, Webb created enameled brooches and bangles shaped like frogs and zebras; the following decade, he again used enamel in chunky abstractions of hammered 18-karat gold and brilliant cabochons. Now, nearly a half century after Webb's death in 1975, the company that bears his name continues to mine his archive of more than 40,000 drawings, producing designs such as this tassel necklace with small beads of pale purple chalcedony, buttery coral, milky green chrysoprase and cobalt-hued lapis lazuli. It feels uncannily attuned to what's in the air these days: a longing for movement and escape. David Webb Bead and Tassel necklace, price on request, davidwebb.com. -- Nancy Hass
Chairs and Tables for the Young Design Enthusiast
Five years ago, when the New York-based interior architect Anne-Sophie Rosseel became a parent, she was dismayed by the cutesy, flimsy children's furniture available. Most of it was "designed to end up in the landfill," says the Belgian-born 41-year-old. "But it wasn't always this way." In the mid-20th century, she points out, Modernists including Charles and Ray Eames, Enzo Mari and Bruno Munari created thoughtful pieces that didn't look out of place in the pared-down living spaces of that era. Now Rosseel is hoping to revive that tradition with her new line of kids' furniture, House of RoRo. Named after her son's favorite teddy bear, the collection, debuting online this month with six items and expanding in the coming months, includes a stackable blue-and-green side table with an optional pair of eyes painted on the interior; a pink-and-red chair with an arched back and seat; a rocking chair with a vintage silk cushion; and a round table with a sculptural base. The pieces, constructed from plywood stained a variety of hues, arrive in flat packs and can be assembled in just a few minutes with a rubber mallet. Rosseel hopes her youngest customers will participate in the process. When children "make an impact on their environment," she says, "it cultivates their sense of agency." From $ 240; available at houseofroro.com. -- Siska Lyssens
Another Thing: A Sporty Louis Vuitton Watch Gets a Streamlined Reinvention
Since the 2002 release of Louis Vuitton's Tambour, the sturdy timepiece named for its drum-shaped case (tambour is French for "drum") had remained relatively the same. But in 2022, when Jean Arnault, 24, the youngest son of Bernard Arnault, the chief executive officer and chairman of the LVMH luxury conglomerate, became the French house's director of watches, he arrived with a plan: to build what he's called a "real boutique horology brand," partly by discontinuing about 130 existing watches and redesigning some of the classics.

Proof in the Pudding
Alcohol-drenched desserts like bananas Foster and baba au rhum have been around long enough to be considered retro. But a new wave of boozy confections are now showing up on menus, many featuring bitter drinks rather than the sweet wines and rums that bakers typically depend on. One favorite: bright green Chartreuse, the liqueur that's been made by Carthusian monks since the 1500s. In England, the pastry chef Sarah Johnson, 42, of Hampshire's Heckfield Place and London's Spring, adds it into ice cream, which she serves alongside roasted pears with warm chocolate sauce. Also in London, Bomee Ki, 35, the pastry chef and co-owner of Sollip, uses ssuk, a plant (known as mugwort in English), to complement the drink's floral notes; her take on an ice cream sandwich includes cake soaked in ssuk syrup and Chartreuse. At Contra and Wildair in New York, the co-chef Fabián von Hauske Valtierra, 33, has been using digestifs to update classic recipes. His tiramisù calls for Marseille amaro from the Brooklyn-based Forthave Spirits in place of the usual rum, brandy or Marsala. "The bitterness balances everything out," says von Hauske Valtierra, who also uses the spent -- a bracing, syrupy byproduct of distillation -- from Forthave's coffee liqueur in the sabayon that tops his chocolate mousse. At Miro Kaimuki in Honolulu, the chef and owner Chris Kajioka, 40, favors Ramazzotti amaro, poaching pears in the spice-infused brew before topping them with banana-caramel sauce. "It offsets the sweetness," he says. And in Melbourne, Australia, Charley Snadden-Wilson, 32, the chef and a co-owner of the wine bar Clover, recently made bright red gummies with Campari, piling them on top of lemon posset ice cream in a creation he designed for the gelateria Piccolina. The flavor profile, he says, is "mainly based around what I like to drink." -- Lauren Joseph
A Fine Jewelry Collection Inspired by Palm Fronds
Since launching his business in 2008, the jewelry designer Eddie Borgo, 45, has crafted custom runway pieces for designers like Joseph Altuzarra, Phillip Lim and Proenza Schouler and found commercial success with his namesake costume pieces. Now, after 15 years in the business, he's finally fulfilling his longtime ambition of creating fine jewelry. The new collection features vintage and antique diamonds set in 18-karat gold and is informed by something Borgo's been seeing a lot more of since gradually moving his business -- and his home -- from New York to Los Angeles over the past five years: palm fronds. "On the most basic level, palms represent relaxation," he says. Their leaves serve as inspiration for Borgo's handcrafted drop earrings and glittering, one-of-a-kind collars, which will be sold at Bergdorf Goodman in New York. "The palm has been revered throughout history as a symbol of victory, peace and eternal light," he says. "It's the embodiment of all that is exotic." -- Jenny Comita

Queen Latifah: [TGreats]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A woman had never been a hip-hop star, an actress and producer and the face of mainstream America all at once. Then she came along and made it look almost easy.
DANA OWENS WAS just 15 when she and her friends started "going over," as they called it, from Newark, N.J., to the Latin Quarter, a nightclub in Midtown Manhattan. She'd finish her shift at Burger King, change into her Swatch tracksuit and take the commuter train under the Hudson River and the subway up to Times Square, where a bouncer would pat her down for weapons. Once inside, she recalls, "it's tight and it's hectic and the energy is crazy." Up on the stage were M.C.s like Melle Mel and Big Daddy Kane -- artists she'd dreamed about seeing live -- whose faces she knew from posters or album covers (rap videos were still rare in 1985). There, where culture was being made in real time, D.J.s tested out records on the crowd before playing them on the radio, and Owens picked up moves that nobody at Irvington High School knew until she brought them back across the river.
The sensitive, magnetic kid who would come to be known as Queen Latifah was a quick study. As a teenager, she wrote poetry inspired by the Black Arts Movement writer Nikki Giovanni, read science fiction novels by Octavia E. Butler and played basketball on a team that won two state championships. She grew up with house music, show tunes, reggae, jazz and gospel. But the Latin Quarter (or Quarters, as it was commonly referred to) was the crucible of a whole new sound, a place where M.C.s delivered praise songs, usually about their own prowess, scored by ingenious soul samples and abrasive effects. There were sets by hot female acts like Salt-N-Pepa (whose 1986 track "My Mic Sounds Nice" was, Latifah says, "a banger") and D.J. Jazzy Joyce (who wore sweatpants and sneakers like she did). Among the most galvanizing was MC Lyte, a virtuoso performer from Brooklyn even younger than her. Latifah remembers thinking, "If Lyte can do it. ..." Hip-hop was driven by confident, competitive young people who watched one another excel and thought, "Why not me?" They thrived on rap and dance battles and actual fights. "But in the midst of all this chaos," Latifah says, "was the hottest music you ever saw in your life." She smiles, adding, "But I was not supposed to be in this club."
Such illicit crossings have defined Latifah's professional life, as has her refusal to land on any one thing -- a quality that, I discover on an afternoon this past July, also characterizes her storytelling. We're sitting in a dimly lit room at the Hit Factory, New York City, a recording studio in NoHo about 40 blocks south of where the Latin Quarter used to be (after closing in 1989, it was replaced by a Ramada Renaissance), and she wants me to picture the scene in its complexity: intensely creative and rightly forbidden. The same 360-degree view is required to understand Latifah herself. She's often celebrated for her pioneering achievements in hip-hop: She's the first solo female rapper to have a gold album; later this year, she will become the first woman rapper to receive a Kennedy Center Honor. (She's also the first hip-hop artist to land a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.) But in addition to her four rap albums, Latifah, now 53, has released two jazz albums; hosted two daytime talk shows; and appeared in more than 60 films, many of which she developed with her management and production company, Flavor Unit Entertainment, founded in 1995 with her business partner, Shakim Compere. By 2003, she was as famous for her high-cheek-boned face in cinematic close-up as for her voice, becoming one of CoverGirl's first full-figured Black models, and later creating her own cosmetics line with the brand geared toward women of color. As the star of the spy thriller "The Equalizer," now approaching its fourth season on CBS, she became one of the first Black female leads on an hourlong network drama.
A 5-foot-10 Black woman from New Jersey only launches and sustains a career like hers with an implacable sense of self-belief. But her power moves -- and her confidence -- have also been fostered by tight groups of collaborators. We might call them her "posses," a concept of rap kinship she advanced on her 1989 single "Princess of the Posse," then translated into several projects that now represent various phases of her cultural influence. Older hip-hop heads still champion Black feminist anthems such as "Ladies First" (1989), which she recorded with the British rapper Monie Love, and her Grammy-winning track "U.N.I.T.Y." (1993) with its sonic left hook: "Who you callin' a bitch?" Slightly younger fans met her on "Living Single," a sitcom featuring four Black girlfriends in Brooklyn that aired from 1993 to 1998. Her turn as a lesbian bank robber in F. Gary Gray's outlaw girl-group film "Set It Off" (1996) is now a classic of the genre; and the 2017 comedy in which she co-starred, "Girls Trip," became the first movie with a Black woman screenwriter (Tracy Oliver, co-writing with Kenya Barris) to gross over $ 100 million at the box office.
These days, Latifah's wholesome, general-audience appeal can conceal the force of her impact. But she strategically facilitated several mergers that once seemed highly unlikely and now define our era: between rap and Hollywood, hip-hop and high fashion, Black capitalism and activism. We now take for granted that Ice Cube and Common produce and star in films and TV shows, and that several of rap's most innovative artists are women (Megan Thee Stallion, Latto). We increasingly see Black actresses onscreen (Viola Davis, Zendaya) representing queer love and desire, and find cover-girl aesthetics embodied by curvy Black artists and models in Rihanna's Savage X Fenty fashion line. We see this because we are living in a world that Latifah helped make. If she seems like us, it's largely because she has made us like her -- members of a posse she might want to roll with.
LATIFAH, WHO INTRODUCED herself simply as La, is wearing her hair in five cornrow braids, and her skin is as radiant as advertised. She compliments my beat-up kitten heels and short haircut. She can't remember which tracks from her second album, "Nature of a Sista"' (1991), she recorded at the Hit Factory when it was on 54th Street and Broadway. But she does remember being there because it was expensive, she says, and because of "the weight and the breadth" of the history associated with the studio. (Michael Jackson was one of many stars who've recorded at its various locations.)
Latifah met Shakim Compere at Irvington High through her mother, Rita Owens, an art teacher. When Latifah signed to Tommy Boy Records in 1989, at age 19, she and Compere -- skeptical that any management company would properly represent her -- started Flavor Unit Entertainment in a windowless office in Newark. Rita co-owned the company but seldom went to the office (it was filled with cigarette smoke, a habit Compere and Latifah have since quit); her scions had already absorbed her goal-oriented, get-yours-and-give-back approach, itself rooted in the politics of Black self-determination. (Latifah has said that in the 1970s, Rita hosted gatherings whose attendees included the poets Amina and Amiri Baraka, which her daughter later learned were Black Panther meetings.)
Flavor Unit was named for a larger crew of rappers and D.J.s who aimed to put New Jersey on the hip-hop map. It was through practicing with the group that Latifah developed her signature sound: a stately, unhurried flow, hooks she sang herself and a range of diasporic musical references. "Princess of the Posse" was as notable for its use of reggae as for its marriage of rap and song, both of which prefigured the work of Lauryn Hill, another rapper-vocalist from the same area of New Jersey. Latifah wasn't the first person to do that, or to foreground female empowerment (MC Lyte's "I Am Woman" came out in 1988), but she synthesized these innovations with a historical consciousness that made her songs at once danceable and righteous. She commanded a range of subjects, from partying (1989's "Dance for Me") to politics (that year's "Evil That Men Do") to sex (1991's "How Do I Love Thee"), and her look affirmed her authority. Dressed up but toned down, she wore African prints and soft kufi crowns that skirted both the femme sex appeal of artists like the Real Roxanne and the casual vibe of Roxanne Shanté.
Then there was her name, the sheer audacity of which can be hard to appreciate now that it's a global brand. "To be a Black girl from Jersey who decides that Dana Owens is no longer big or accurate enough to describe who she is," says the journalist Danyel Smith, "and to change her name to Queen Latifah -- it was just bold." At the time, Black kids across the country were adopting Arabic names (in the style of their nationalist elders), and Owens felt like "Latifah" captured her inner softness and delicacy, which most people missed. When she added the "Queen" upon signing to Tommy Boy, she was paying homage to South African anti-apartheid struggles while also crowning herself. Jada Pinkett Smith, 52, a close friend and her "Set It Off" co-star, recalls seeing a photo of Latifah at a Baltimore club in the late 1980s. "That was the first time I'd heard a young woman put 'queen' before her name," Pinkett Smith says. It made her think, "We are queens, aren't we?"
As the only female act in the core group of performers on Public Enemy's Fear of a Black Planet tour in the early 1990s, Latifah learned how to make the most of the small stage area in front of the headliner's setup and wore her kufis in part to avoid getting her hair done. ("This is a queen vibe and it's a soul vibe, but it's also a saving-me-several-hundred-dollars-a-day vibe," she says.) Danyel Smith compares Latifah's persona back then to that of the "neighborhood superstar: the prettiest, coolest girl on the block; the toughest girl, who was still nice to you even though she was popular." But Latifah's confidence, while it might have seemed innate, took constant practice. In her 1999 book, "Ladies First: Revelations of a Strong Woman," she describes being gripped by fear before taking the stage at her first high school talent show: "What if they don't like me? What if somebody boos?" Then she flipped the question: "What if they love me? What if they give me a standing ovation?" She sang Luther Vandross's "If Only for One Night," and the crowd adored it. With every such venture, her confidence expanded, as her older brother, Lancelot Owens Jr., known by his nickname, Winki, told her it would.
She took what she learned from male crews to create spaces for women, defying both the inherent competition among female rappers and their enforced separation: As MC Lyte tells it in the AMC documentary "Hip-Hop: The Songs That Shook America," her label refused to let her join Latifah and Monie Love on "Ladies First." That duet became, according to the writer Kierna Mayo, "the first song to openly address sexism in hip-hop," adding to rap's race consciousness what we would now call an intersectional analysis. But it began, Love says, with two friends in separate corners of Power Play Studios in Queens, unable to write more than a few lines before rushing back over to share them: " 'Listen to this, La!' 'Oh, that's crazy!"' Looking back on their musical interplay, Love describes Latifah's flow as "majestic" and herself as the queen's amped-up attendant: She declares herself, in one verse, to be "merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily hyperhappy overjoyed / pleased with all the beats and rhymes my sisters have employed." The video stitches together a sisterhood of historical figures (Harriet Tubman, Angela Davis and Winnie Mandela are shown in photographs), and several other contemporary female rappers.
Its central image, of Latifah as a military commander knocking white chess pieces off a map, also evokes the makeshift war rooms vital to hip-hop's early years. At a time when some in the mainstream media framed rap as an artless fad or a scourge (the efforts of an organization called the Parents Music Resource Center, co-founded by Tipper Gore, the wife of future Vice President Al Gore, led to stickers flagging the "explicit lyrics" of rap albums), she and her friends would meet in the studio to debrief about the latest anti-rap slander. "Whatever they said [on the news] is garbage. This is going to last, this is going to influence the world," Love recalls their saying. "When anybody was feeling like, 'Man, it's not gonna happen' -- nope, she'd jump right in." But even with Latifah's early successes, there was a precariousness to those years. Compere had to demand money from club promoters reluctant to pay what they'd promised, and she was called upon to navigate thorny questions about censorship from the press. Then, in 1992, Winki was killed in a motorcycle accident at age 24, a loss that nearly undid her. She had bought him the bike -- riding was a shared love of theirs -- and she couldn't fathom the life she was building without him. She writes in "Ladies First" that it was only her belief in God that kept her from suicide. Instead, she plunged into drinking and smoking weed, then into work. She made a furious, brilliant album, "Black Reign" (1993), that was dedicated to her brother and is still her favorite.
SHE MOVED INTO television and film to expand her influence and diversify her options before she aged out of rap. But in one of her first TV roles, in 1991, as Will Smith's friend turned crush on "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" (1990-96), practically every scene included a joke about her weight. By the time she joined the cast of "Living Single," the jokes were hers. When her character, an ambitious magazine editor named Khadijah, is asked to picture a world without men, she grins: "A bunch of fat, happy women and no crime!" Just as "Living Single" capitalized on the rise of Black sitcoms like "The Cosby Show" and "A Different World" to tell a story that centered Black women, the scholar Amanda Wicks has written, "Set It Off" issued a feminist response to dramas like John Singleton's "Boyz N the Hood" (1991). Here, too, Latifah seemed freer to shine amid a strong ensemble cast. As Cleo, a bank robber avenging her friends' traumatic mistreatment by the police, she cranks up her comic timing and reveals new subtleties. In one scene, her character pulls up in a getaway car beside that of her friends. When she realizes one of the women has died of gunshot wounds, her face crumples and she leans toward the steering wheel, as if she doesn't want even the camera to see her cry.
With "Set It Off," Latifah joined another group, what the journalist Clover Hope calls in her book, "The Motherlode: 100+ Women Who Made Hip-Hop" (2021), "the first generation of rappers ... to build a bankable Hollywood résumé." Narrating her coterie's moves, Latifah says, "Will [Smith] did it," then she did it, "and I'm sure LL [Cool J] was like, 'Well, if they can do it. ..."'
The highlights reel of her acting career -- including her Oscar nomination for "Chicago" (2002) -- can obscure the fact that she appeared in over 20 films before she was cast as a solo lead, in "Last Holiday" (2006); and several more before she took center stage in a love story of her own, opposite Common in "Just Wright" (2010). She and Compere conceived that one themselves. If forgetting where you came from is the successful hip-hop artist's cardinal sin, Latifah seems to have averted it by developing thoughtful mainstream films and hiring massive and diverse crews to make them. Most people in Hollywood "call who's on that same old sheet for them to hire, and it's comfortable for them," she says. "But it's not comfortable for me." Flipping the script on arguments that colorblind hiring practices seek "the best" candidates, she asks, "How are we gonna make sure we have the best if everyone isn't included?"
To direct the 2015 HBO biopic "Bessie," about the Jazz Age singer Bessie Smith, she hired Dee Rees, then known for her lesbian coming-of-age film, "Pariah" (2011). Rees's script emphasizes Bessie's bisexuality and gender fluidity, as well as the distinctive approaches of women in an industry run by men. The blues matriarch Ma Rainey (played by Mo'Nique) negotiates her own fees with white businessmen, while Bessie's husband (Jack Gee, played by Michael K. Williams) secures a recording contract on her behalf. Asked whether Compere's maleness has opened doors for her, Latifah explains that he has at times helpfully presented "people's idea of what a man is." But she also says that she and Compere have worked with powerful women at every turn, from record executives to booking and film agents. "There is no hip-hop as we know it," she adds, "without Sylvia Robinson," who co-founded the first rap label, Sugar Hill Records, in 1979.
"The Equalizer" also brings together a group of loyal collaborators. Debra Martin Chase, who produces the series -- and who also helped to create "Just Wright" -- says that Latifah's father, Lancelot Owens Sr., a former cop (he and Rita separated when Latifah was 10), hangs out on the set and advises her on fight scenes. The series also occasioned a giddy reunion with Pinkett Smith. "Let me tell you something," says the actress. "La can come off as so serious, but La doesn't want to do nothing but have a good time."
The show has Latifah occupying a role first played by a white man, Edward Woodward, in the 1980s, then adapted by Denzel Washington for the film franchise that originated in the 2010s. Latifah's Robyn McCall is a hero of citizens failed by the state; she's "the one you call when you can't call 911," as the character herself puts it: a neighborhood superstar, to recall Danyel Smith's phrase, like Latifah's hip-hop persona. (You can tell she's in charge in part because the makeup artists leave visible, as she prefers, the scar on her forehead that she got from wrestling with Winki when she was 3.) But whereas a young Latifah was both imperiled and propelled by rap's cultural visibility, one of the pleasures of the show is to watch her fly under the radar in various guises (lawyer, fighter, chauffeur), relishing a mutability traditionally enjoyed only by white men. Still, network TV has its limits: Robyn's Aunt Vi (played by Lorraine Toussaint) has a female lover -- a queer story line the creators opted not to give Robyn herself.
ONE OF THE lessons of hip-hop, as the music turns 50, might be that revolutions are ever unfinished. The people who created the genre were the spiritual and literal descendants of the 1960s grass-roots activists who started their own community theaters, breakfast programs and free health clinics; who organized marches and festivals. Their children grew up in places like Watts and Baltimore, which were still underfunded and overpoliced. But they knew how to organize. They made a new form of music, art and dance, as well as the merchandise to promote it and the companies to produce it. ("Boy, are we businesspeople," Latifah says. "How else do you think this happened?") They bought homes for their parents -- as Latifah did, at age 21, for her mother -- when the banks wouldn't lend them money. After Rita died of scleroderma in 2018, Latifah made a documentary to raise awareness of a lung disease that complicated her mother's condition. She and Compere were behind Rise Living, an apartment complex in central Newark that includes 16 affordable housing units and is also meant to encourage higher-income residents to stay in the neighborhood. "Why not me?" is a question raised not only by ambitious creatives but also by citizens who decide to make change. "This was never something to keep to myself," she says. "It was always something that was supposed to help change all our lives."
It was also meant to be enjoyed. "I always wind up talking about social issues when it comes to my journey," she says. "But I've gotta tell you, it was mostly a lot of fun." At a tribute event for David Jolicoeur, a member of the hip-hop group De La Soul who died earlier this year, the D.J. played "Ladies First," and Latifah summoned Love -- "Monie, what's up?" -- to perform the song again. Ever her eager attendant, Love jumped at the chance, she says, feeling "the same excitement" as the day they wrote and recorded the track. Those who know her well say there are many reasons Latifah keeps hustling: a sense of mission, a lifestyle to finance. But above all, it is a blessing to have survived, and she's still enjoying herself.
If we admire her without knowing her, it's because she candidly shares stories about her formative years in lieu of news about her life. (She has dodged questions about her sexuality at least since "Set It Off," but she publicly acknowledged having a partner, the choreographer Eboni Nichols, with whom she has a 4-year-old son, at a BET Awards ceremony in 2021.) Her second book, "Put on Your Crown" (2010), is far less forthcoming than her first, which detailed her grief after Winki's death and her struggle to find the right man. These days, she says, "I share my whole life with the public. I share my gifts with you. I don't have to share my personal business." When she adds that she'll never be intimidated by "some damn reporter," it's an oblique enough shot that we can bounce back from it. I think of a scene in "Bessie" in which the singer comes home after a concert and gazes at her reflection in a mirror in a darkened room. For all her love of a crew, Latifah has likely stayed sane by protecting her home life as well as her solitude. It was in these spaces of quiet where Dana Owens got to know Queen Latifah in the first place, and where she thought to ask, "What if they love me?" After decades of suturing worlds -- Black and white, men and women -- the space between private and public is one she refuses to thread.
BEFORE WE GO, I ask about a lyric from "The Light," a 2009 song in which, after a roll call of great entertainers from New Jersey (including Bruce Springsteen, Sarah Vaughan and Frank Sinatra), she issues this encouragement:
You gon' make it girl, you gon' make it -- fo' sure!
Visualize it in your mind, then apply pressure!
... If you stay true to the cause, the world'll believe
And you can say, "Mama, look at me!"
"I made it to the light"
Latifah sings the last line on an easy midrange loop like a lullaby. Yet the words seem to shift over the course of the track from "I made it to the light" to "I'm headed to the light" -- thus shuttling between the pride of arrival and continued aspiration. But before I map this duality onto her whole career, I want to make sure I'm hearing it right.
"We could play it and I could tell you," she offers. She's already singing and rhyming while finding the song on her phone -- "That's some good-ass lyrics on that record," she says -- and I'm struck by both her pitch-perfect voice and her total recall of the track, which she recorded 14 years ago. I watch her, head down, phone to her ear, jamming out to her song.
Yes, it's both "I made it to" and "I'm headed to," but she adds more layers. "It's also a divine thing," she says. "It's a blessing to be in the light. And to make it? It's a one-in-a-million shot. It's that Latin Quarters feeling. It's looking at them on that elevated stage. They've got the lights and the mic and it's like, 'Just stay on your course!"' Here, in one of many intimate encounters with herself, she is addressing Latifah the teenager and using the memory of her early drive to recharge in the present. Then, as now, there was much more to come.

Full text: Four years after the 1892 death of Louis Vuitton, who had built his humble trunk-making business into a Victorian-era colossus, his son, Georges, created a repeating quatrefoil motif to distinguish the brand's canvas-and-leather goods from widespread copies. Combining medieval simplicity, neo-Gothic refinement and the tasteful Japonisme of the time, the four-pointed mark continues to adorn the maison's designs today, including collaborations with the architect Frank Gehry and the artists Yayoi Kusama and Takashi Murakami. Now, Francesca Amfitheatrof, the artistic director of watches and jewelry at Louis Vuitton, has found a new way to express the symbol's enduring power: an elaborate proprietary diamond cut, as seen in this dazzling white-gold-and-platinum bejeweled collar. Set directly above the brilliant center emerald, among 51 other custom-cut diamonds, the many-faceted, two-carat flower is a subtle yet dynamic sign that the historic house refuses to remain stuck in place.
